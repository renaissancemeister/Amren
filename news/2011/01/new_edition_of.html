<h1><a href="http://shelf-life.ew.com/2011/01/03/huckleberry-finn-n-word-censor-edit/">New Edition of &#8216;Huckleberry Finn&rsquo; to Lose the &#8216;N&rsquo; Word</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What is a word worth? According to Publishers Weekly, NewSouth Books&rsquo; upcoming edition of Mark Twain&rsquo;s seminal novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will remove all instances of the &#8220;n&#8221; word  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ll give you a hint, it&rsquo;s not nonesuch  &mdash;  present in the text and replace it with slave. The new book will also remove usage of the word Injun. The effort is spearheaded by Twain expert Alan Gribben, who says his PC-ified version is not an attempt to neuter the classic but rather to update it. &#8220;Race matters in these books,&#8221; Gribben told PW. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a matter of how you express that in the 21st century.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there are already those who are yelling &#8220;Censorship!&#8221; as well as others with thesauruses yelling &#8220;Bowdlerization!&#8221; and &#8220;Comstockery!&#8221; {snip} On the other hand, if this puts the book into the hands of kids who would not otherwise be allowed to read it due to forces beyond their control (overprotective parents and the school boards they frighten), then maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be so quick to judge. {snip} The original product is changed for the benefit of those who, for one reason or another, are not mature enough to handle it, but as long as it doesn&rsquo;t affect the original, is there a problem?</p>

		<p>I was just wondering if it is too late to make some suggestions.</p>
<p>Instead of ni**er, how about &#8220;subjugated black manual laborer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of Inj*n, how about &#8220;displaced aboriginal inhabitant.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did indeed have an upper level English Lit class where we heard a recording. I forget what the subject was (I think it was something by Twain), but the original wording was, &#8221; &hellip; working like a ni**er.&#8221; The narrator changed it to &#8220;working like a Trojan.&#8221; This was in the early &#8216;70&rsquo;s.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s curious - the same kids who will allegedly be done irreparable damage by this word should it appear in a classic work of literature, are utterly unharmed by seeing/hearing it umpteen times a day in their &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; music peddled relentlessly by MTV, etc. </p>

		<p>An English teacher wrote on this issue in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2005:</p>
<p>&#8220;As an English teacher, I&rsquo;ve struggled with the decision to assign works I know contain inflammatory, malicious language. For example, I&rsquo;ve worried that the repeated appearance of racist epithets in William Faulkner&rsquo;s &#8221;The Sound and the Fury&rsquo; or Flannery O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s short stories could perpetuate the ignorance and insensitivity they depict. Repeatedly, though, I&rsquo;ve decided to assign these works, believing that their merits outweigh the discomfort they create. Yet I provide that rationale with doubt and reservations, acknowledging my limited experience with that particular discomfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the racist language of these works necessary? It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine that Faulkner and O&rsquo;Connor asked themselves that question. These writers, however, committed themselves to an accurate depiction of the time and place they chronicled   &mdash;   one in which ignorance and cruelty often trumped openness and compassion. Doubtless you see how we continue to struggle with such a conflict today. With ugly characters often comes ugly language. Hesitate to see in an author&rsquo;s depiction of the odious and offensive a condoning of either. The novel or short story that shies away from such characters risks dishonesty, naivete, and sterility; it also veers from the important conversations you could prompt with a thoughtful confrontation of this issue.<br>
Should you choose to raise the issue in class, realize that you have an obligation to speak for no one other than yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Having taught in a classroom of limited but increasing diversity, I&rsquo;ve too often seen students in the majority look to an African-American student as if he were spokesman for his race. That&rsquo;s an unfair burden. Speak of your own experience and reaction to the literature in question: Your individual story could be as poignant and eye-opening as the one under discussion.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>The path of least resistance, therefore the path most often chosen in the government school sytems, is censorship, usually of the pre-emptive variety.  The classic text on this subject is THE LANGUAGE POLICE: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Student Learn (2003) by Diane Ravitch.   <br>

<p>I never read the book but I believe Mr. Twain used this specific word for its impact. Changing or removing the word sort of blunts the lesson he was trying to teach to the very people who will now miss that lesson.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another novel which addresses this issue; where words and ideas were thrown down the &#8216;memory hole&rsquo; and people worked to remove words of the dictionary.</p>
<p>I wonder how many other Twain experts agree with the work of Mr. Gribben.</p>

		<p>What is probably the greatest novel written by an American now has to be altered to meet the bigotry of the NAACP and pc liberals.  How truly sad!  If people can read the real novel, they will learn that the &#8220;n&#8221; word was sometimes used without meanness, and indeed with affection.  But the editors of the new edition are not interested in having readers learn; they seem to be interested only in making more money as the new edition may not be blacklisted by the pc racist bigots.  Perhaps their next mission will be to delete Shylock from the Merchant of Venice.  &mdash;    &mdash;  -Hugh Murray  </p>

		<p> Political correctness&rsquo; ultimate triumph: Removal of the most key word from the greatest of all American novels.</p>
<p> We&rsquo;re so terrified of that word nowadays that we&rsquo;re not even allowed to say it on this &#8220;Race Realism&#8221; website, without having our post deleted. So I refuse to use the currently fashionable euphemism   &mdash;   we know what the word is. But I&rsquo;d say removing that key word from &#8220;Huckleberry Finn&#8221; is comparable to the frenzied determination of so many Protestant scholars of nowadays to &#8220;modernize&#8221; the King James Bible.</p>
<p> No revision can compare with an original. If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t &#8220;fix it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Unabashedly unafraid to change history.  Huckleberry Finn is a book that reflects the times.  Are we afraid of the past to where we have to change it?  If we change Mark Twain, what else in our history is subject to change by the sanitation experts?<br>

		<p>Why stop there?  This frees us up to make many classic books more &#8220;accessable&#8221; to diverse young people, such as:</p>
<p>1)  In addition to the removal of icky words, Huckleberry Finn will leave his raft to apply for a scholarship to a Boston boarding school.  </p>
<p>2)  Holden Caulfield will spend &#8220;Catcher in the Rye&#8221; praising authority figures and the importance of manners.</p>
<p>3)  All the pirates in &#8220;Treasure Island&#8221; will now wear life vests at all times.</p>
<p>4)  Alcohol and all hints of promiscuity will be removed from Hemingway.  </p>
<p>5)  &#8220;Charlotte&rsquo;s Web&#8221; will take place at a petting zoo tended by vegans.  </p>
<p>6)  Scarlet O&rsquo;Hara will be rewritten as a studious, generous young mulatto.<br>

		<p>Can someone explain to me how a book that is one of the finest pieces of literature this country has ever produced (and it has produced a lot) needs to be scrubbed of a word that offends an audience which intentionally surrounds itself with that word constantly. </p>
<p>Listen to as many hour&rsquo;s worth of music most popular with black people today as it takes to read &#8220;Huckleberry Finn&#8221; and you will hear the n-word probably two or three times as often as it&rsquo;s used in the book.</p>
<p>Blacks should not get to make an endless number of foul-mouthed ditties full of the word, but then turn around and demand that the word be scrubbed Orwell-style from works of great lit. </p>

This is a Soviet style re-writing of literature to comform with &#8220;Multicultural Realism.&#8221;  If you don&rsquo;t like it, you don&rsquo;t have to read it. </p>

		<p>Another example of the cultural Nazis going after a part of American culture by banning a word that in those days was a part of the vocabulary. The original article stated that the word was purged from the novel so as not to offend readers; those being Black readers who toss the word n  &mdash;    &mdash;  r around like birdseed at a wedding. <br>
As for &#8220;injun&#8221; that was the southern dialectical pronunciation (by the less educated) of the word &#8220;indian&#8221; where the &#8220;d&#8221; followed by the &#8220;ia&#8221; dipthong are pronounced with more of a &#8220;j&#8221; sound. It was not used as a perjorative. </p>
<p>To modify in any way the text of a classic piece of literature or for that matter ANY piece of literature is a cultural atrocity. It&rsquo;s a slippery slope that is one of the roads that lead to the last days of a free society.<br>

<p><i>The original product is changed for the benefit of those who, for one reason or another, are not mature enough to handle it, but as long as it doesn&rsquo;t affect the original, is there a problem?</i></p>
<p><br>
The reporter&rsquo;s choice of the wording &#8220;mature enough to handle it,&#8221; tells us more about the situation than I&rsquo;m sure he ever intended to convey. Yes, there <i>are</i> people not mature enough to handle non-sanitized Mark Twain: blacks.</p>
<p>As for the conclusion that &#8220;as long as it doesn&rsquo;t affect the original, is there a problem?&#8221;, the answer to that one is that the original obviously HAS been affected. When you change an author&rsquo;s words   &mdash;   especially for such spurious reasons   &mdash;   it is impossible for the original NOT to be affected. </p>
<p>And not for the better. </p>

		<p>This is digraceful on so many levels.  </p>
<p>First, it represents brazen copyright infringement.  Where does this &#8220;publisher&#8221; get off bowdlerizing a published work for brazenly political purposes without permission of the author&rsquo;s estate?   </p>
<p>Second, it reveals a mind-bending philistinism of racial egalitarians every bit as egregious as that of the religious Right   &mdash;   an inability to understand art from the context of the artist.  The idea that depiction of something in a novel (or movie or painting) constitutes de facto advocacy of that something is exactly what links censors on the Right and Left.  </p>
<p>Third, it shows a disrespect for American history.  Samuel Clemens/Mark Twain arguably was the greatest writer America has ever produced.  He was showing how people routinely talked back then.  If the &#8220;feelings&#8221; of certain black readers might be hurt if they had to read the unexpurgated version of &#8220;Huckleberry Finn&#8221; (or any other work of his) well&hellip;tough for them.  Let these clowns write their own novel.      </p>

<p>Guess it&rsquo;s time to bury my copy of Huckleberry Finn (in the original) in the garden lest a copy of it be found in my possession and I am burned along with my books.</p>

Okay, then. I have a list of words and phrases I&rsquo;d like removed from public hearing. Where do I submit the list, and how long before action will be taken? </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work that way, though, does it? <br>

		<p>I attended high school in the early 70&rsquo;s (graduated Class of &#8216;74) our Literature teacher assigned Huckleberry Finn in either my Sophomore or Junior year, not sure which now. He carefully explained that Twain wrote in the style and common language of HIS times, and that even though times and  approved words had changed, it was necessry to see the slice of history provided by the book. If teachers would explain this to students now, changing the book would be totally unnecessary.<br>
As for fearful and wimpy parents that won&rsquo;t allow their children to read the book for fear that their pure little eyes might see a word in print  &mdash;  they need to wake up  &mdash;  their little darlings hear &#8220;the N word&#8221; countless times a day in their popular music.(And both black and white kids use the word daily, in the case of the white kids far from the ears of disapproving parents and black kids who would maul them.)    </p>

		<p>Just for everyone&rsquo;s edification, the N word was alive and well on the NYC subway train I took this morning. It may (or may not have)have been &#8220;a&#8221; instead of &#8220;er&#8221; but it was uttered by a polyglot bunch of Asian and Latino schoolkids.  <br>

		<p>The &#8220;N word&#8221; continues to be used with rhetorical aptness by<br>
Blacks to refer to other Blacks, and there is widespread <br>
consensus among Blacks about who is in that category and who is not.  Many abler white persons in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s in Dixie<br>
border states in which I then lived, would use the N word for<br>
some village Blacks  &mdash;  and &#8220;Colored&#8221; for others.  That the word<br>
could be used brutally and imprudently is true of life (as it <br>
remains today with much of language ).  That the N&rsquo;word  deserves to be crammed down the Memory Hole points to larger problems now threatening to envelop us all.    </p>

		<p>Back in high school days we had to study a Joseph Conrad novel entitled &#8220;N  &mdash;    &mdash;  r&#8221; of the Narcissus. Will this be yet another book that has to be burned?</p>
<p>As for changing the N word in Mark Twain&rsquo;s work, this is worse than censorship, it is a case of the PC brigade changing history.</p>

		<p>The N-word appears numerous times in Toni Morrison&rsquo;s overrated and barely coherent novel, Beloved. Yet somehow I don&rsquo;t think the censors will touch it. </p>

		<p>@Pelayo Excuse me, but &#8220;cultural Nazis&#8221;? What is that supposed to mean? The national socialists would, of all people, have been the first to RETAIN the original wording. The national socialists wanted above all else to preserve the culture of the past. It&rsquo;s the hard Leftists who are instituting multicultural totalitarianism. The national socialists were the opposite (indeed, the sworn enemies) of the cultural Marxists   &mdash;   the people who ARE making all of this happen.</p>
