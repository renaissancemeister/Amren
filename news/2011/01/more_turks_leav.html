<h1>More Turks Leaving Germany Than Coming In</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marketplace (American Public Media), January 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><b>Kai Ryssdal: </b>There was a report out today from the European Commission talking about consumer sentiment over there. It&rsquo;s pretty high, back to where it was before the recession started. That&rsquo;s thanks in part to how well Europe&rsquo;s biggest economy, Germany, is doing. It&rsquo;s doing so well, as we told you yesterday that Germany&rsquo;s having trouble filling all the jobs it has. That labor shortage is being made worse by a specific pattern of reverse migration. For the first time since Germany started importing workers from Turkey 50 years ago, more Turks are moving out of Germany than are moving in.</p>
<p>From Istanbul, Marketplace&rsquo;s Stephen Beard reports.</p>
<p><b>Stephen Beard: </b>Ahmet Bahadiarli is driving around the pleasant suburb of Bahcesehir on the outskirts of Istanbul. Ahmet settled here when he arrived in Turkey more than a year ago, because it reminded him of Germany, the country where he was born.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He likes his gated apartment complex not because he&rsquo;s worried about crime. It&rsquo;s because in unruly Istanbul, he craves German-style order  &mdash;  prompting the question: Why did he leave Germany?</p>
<p><b>Bahadiarli: </b>I never felt really comfortable in Germany. May I behave like a German, I think like a German, but I never feel like a German. I always feel myself as a foreigner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A ferry ride away across the Bosphorus Strait  &mdash;  on the other side of Istanbul  &mdash;  another young German Turk has a rather different story to tell. Architect Emine Sahin says she never suffered discrimination growing up in Germany. She came back to Turkey four years ago for economic reasons, because the construction industry was booming here. She donned a hard hat and worked as a site manager  &mdash;  and here she encountered discrimination.</p>
<p><b>Emine Sahin: </b>As a woman in the construction sector, it&rsquo;s difficult, because it&rsquo;s a sector that&rsquo;s male-dominated sector. It&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>Difficult to get male workers to carry out her instructions. Now she works in real estate development and has other frustrations, like, she claims, Turkish timekeeping.</p>
<p><b>Sahin: </b>The German people are punctual. If you have your meeting at ten o&rsquo;clock, you will be there two minutes to 10. But in Turkey, they are sometimes two hours late and they say, &#8220;OK, I&rsquo;m sorry because it was traffic.&#8221; But if you know there is traffic, go two hours earlier.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The German-Turks, it must be said, are not entirely popular with the locals. This song sums up the feeling. It complains about inconsiderate returnees. Others claim the incomers speak poor Turkish.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be a cultural clash, says business manager Yildiz Taylan. She left Turkey at the age of nine, and now is back from Germany at the age of 40 to find her roots.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nevertheless, thanks to Turkey&rsquo;s buoyant economy, many thousands more seem likely to follow her path. A recent survey suggests that one-third of all German-Turkish college students plan to pursue a career in Turkey.</p>

		<p>For Americans who maybe don&rsquo;t know it:</p>
<p>Obama and Bush wanted Turkey to join the EU. Even the Turks admit that every second Turk wants to come to Germany if he has the chance. Most Europeans and the very most of Germans don&rsquo;t want that to happen but our left wing government and the USA still want it. So the reason is, why should they come to Germany illegally, when they can come here in a few years legally?</p>
<p>And the Turks here are making much more kids than German, so their percentage is increasing - another fact the Author &#8220;has forget to say&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote> 
More than 10%, so every tenth grown up in Germany, is now out of a real Job. The government is doing anything to hide that statistics. And a few months ago one of the biggest German News magazines called &#8220;SPIEGEL&#8221; brought out a big story about a scientist statistics proofing that the lack of workers is &#8220;a total lie&#8221;!

<p>Only a few days later the next top story was about how politics and industry had hold pressure on the chief of the Institute to not publish this paper so they could go on with their politics to import third worlders to dump down the loans.<br>

		<p>Clearly the Turks weren&rsquo;t coming to contribute to German culture, but to take advantage of its insanely generous welfare state. Like squirrels in a bird feeder, once the seed is gone, so are they. </p>

		<p>Before the Germans get too happy, I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that the 1/3 of Turks who plan to leave are not the ones causing problems.</p>
<p>They are the ones who understand why the Germans do not like them and generally educated enough to do well anywhere.</p>
<p>The ones in gangs/on welfare will stay in Germany to &#8216;enrich&rsquo; the lives of countless Germans.</p>

		<p>Personally, I think this is a trend that Germany should try to encourage. Pay each young Turk the Euro-equivalent of $20,000 to give up their German citizenship, leave, and never return, and the Germans would still see a savings compared to what they&rsquo;d have to shell out to deal with the cost of giving welfare to the Turks and managing the effects of the crimes they commit.</p>

		<p>#4 is right, as Europe regains its sanity and comes out of the multiculti dementia, it is clear that the continent is doomed unless we can bribe enough Muslims to leave, and encourage the rest to go by curtailing welfare payments.</p>
<p>To collect government benefits FOR LIFE is THE ONLY REASON 99% OF 3RD WORLD AND MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS ARE IN EUROPE IN THE FIRST PLACE - and anyone who says otherwise is a pathological liar. </p>
<p>I fervently hope the Germans resist allowing Turkey - the historic enemy of all things European and now the newest Iran (crazed theocracy trapped in the 5th century AD) - to join the EU. </p>

		<p>From #1, interesting about the government lies on unemployment figures. In the US we don&rsquo;t quite have that, but we did and do have Bill Gates openly lying about a shortage of programmers in the US so that the industry could import cheaper labor from India and elsewhere.</p>

		<p>I taught at a &#8220;charter&#8221; school in Tucson, Arizona. Charter schools can do whatever the hell they want, as we have seen at the &#8220;afrocentric&#8221; charter schools that teach afro pseudo-science and history.</p>
<p>At my charter school, students were required to study Chinese or Turkish; although, I did not know one Turkish student. At another charter school in Tucson, all students are required to study Turkish. The administrators at that school are Turkish immigrants, and they actually hire from Turkey, rather that hire qualified Americans to teach at this state-funded public school. They have the state&rsquo;s blessing to do so.</p>
<p>I came very close to getting in fist fights with the Turkish clown who taught at my school. My school invited foreign Turks to study at our school: two 18-year old men who went to school with children as young as four and five years old. I witnessed abuse.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t tell you about my foul experiences with these uncivilized buffoons because I fear that Amren won&rsquo;t publish them. Suffice it to say, that I was often face to face and toe to toe with Turks because of their behavior; I contacted the police, the sheriff, and Child Protective Services and reported inarguable child abuse by these foreign clowns. Nothing was done. No public official seems willing to confront foreigners. (By the way, I am in Tucson, where Sheriff (ha ha ha) Dupnik (familiar to all lately because of the Giffords shooting) won&rsquo;t lift a finger to protect citizens from foreigners. Citiznes, break the law in Tucson. You WILL go to jail. Foreigners, especially illegal invaders, break the law freely.</p>
<p>I feel as though I am rambling. In short, I never knew a Turk until I taught in Tucson. Because of the deplorable behavior that I have witnessed, I despise every one that I have met here &hellip; and, damn it, they are teaching our Tusconan children and teaching them that islam is good, Christianity and Judaism are bad, and I have seen physical/sexual abuse repeatedly, and nothing was done.</p>
<p>I will be watching Turkish foreigners in my state closely. </p>

		<p>When the Germans instituted their &#8220;Gastarbeiter&#8221; (i.e., guestworker) program back in the Fifties to rebuild their postwar economy, they didn&rsquo;t anticipate that the predominantly Turkish workers would stick around and start families.  Surprise!  Even when formally terminated in 1973, the program irrevocably had changed Germany.  Another case of the high cost of cheap labor.</p>
<p>Here, at least, is a piece of good news, proof that self-deportation can work.  </p>

		<p>I agree with #3 TomSwift.</p>
<p>++++++++++++++</p>
<p>A lot of people confuse German order with totalitarianism. They only learn to appreciate it once they no longer have it. It is the same as freedom. </p>
<p>This is one reason why I like Germany, Germans, and the German language. Everything has order and a specific purpose. </p>

		<p>I live in Germany and haven&rsquo;t heard anything about Turks moving OUT of Germany.  There are nice Turks here, no doubt, however there is a major problem with assimilation, especially in the larger cities.</p>
<p>There are schools here that have up to 98% foreign students, most of them Muslim.  There are problems.  No one wants to acknowledge these problems.</p>
<p>A recent television survey DID however show that ca. 90% here in Germany do NOT believe that &#8220;Islam&#8221; belongs here!  Ought to tell us something, eh???</p>

		<p>As Germany has so painfully learned, there is nothing more permanent than &#8220;temporary labour&#8221;, and there is nothing more expensive than &#8220;cheap labour&#8221;.</p>

		<p>To #7.  In Tucson too?  Funny, there&rsquo;s a &#8220;charter school&#8221; here in Oklahoma City, and another one up in Tulsa that&rsquo;s word-for-word IDENTICAL to your description of the one in Tucson down to the virtually non-English speaking administrators/owners/and more than a teacher or two&hellip;also Turkish, I believe&hellip; certainly Islamic&hellip; and the compulsory study of&hellip; [i]ahem[/i]&hellip; Turkish.  </p>
<p>Germany now, your city next.</p>

<p>According to what I know when the Germany instituted their &#8220;Gastarbeiter&#8221; (i.e., guestworker) program they did not think of the Turkish at all. They wanted European guest workers. Turkey begged them to let their people come there, but Germany did not want them. According to my in formation finally the US-goverment made Germans do this.</p>
<p>If you can read German and are interested in this you might enjoy the book &#8220;Diplomatische Tauschgeschäfte: Gastarbeiter in der westdeutschen Diplomatie und Beschäftigungspolitik 1953-1973&#8221; by Heike Knortz</p>
