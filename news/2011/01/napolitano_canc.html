			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, January 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced Friday that she has canceled the troubled virtual fence project along the southwest border, proposing a new plan which she claims will better address each region&rsquo;s border security needs.</p>
<p>The decision comes a year after the secretary ordered a review of the project, which was hampered by delays and technological glitches, and froze its funding. The original plan, known as SBInet, envisioned a system of cameras and sensors which would allow officers to monitor crossings and dispatch Border Patrol agents to catch anyone entering the United States illegally.</p>
<p>Napolitano said her department briefed members of Congress on Friday about the final decision to nix the program &#8220;as originally conceived.&#8221; But she said DHS will pursue a &#8220;new path forward&#8221; for security along the 2,000-mile southern U.S. border. The secretary said that while the U.S. cannot provide a &#8220;single, integrated border security technology solution,&#8221; the new plan will use different technologies in different areas.</p>
<p>That could mean a system of surveillance towers in one area and unmanned drones in another. It could mean thermal imaging in one area and elements of the old SBInet plan in another.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., a leading critic of the old virtual fence plan, applauded Napolitano&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Independent, quantitative, science-based assessments will continue along each sector of the southwest border in 2011 to determine the optimal combination of technology for each region,&#8221; Napolitano said.</p>

		<p>Bennie Thompson is right (see the source article).  But he&rsquo;s too oblivious to understand why he&rsquo;s right.  This &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; was never meant to work, and it was precisely meant to be expensive.  That&rsquo;s because the Bush administration didn&rsquo;t want it to work, because they wanted the illegal aliens, and they wanted to dump a whole bunch of money in Boeing&rsquo;s lap.  All the while, rolling it out as &#8220;real border security&#8221; in order to fool the masses that the border was actually &#8220;secure&#8221; as the carrot to the stick of &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; i.e. amnesty, i.e. negating the need for any border security, pretend or real.</p>
<p>Back to the article, I don&rsquo;t read &#8220;101st Airborne&#8221; or &#8220;10,000 volts&#8221; anywhere in the list of replacement solutions.  Therefore, whatever Napolitano replaces the fake non-solution with will also not work, for she doesn&rsquo;t want real border security either.</p>

		<p>The Virtual Fence was never intended to work, and everyone knew it from the start.  The real purpose of the Virtual was to transfer Billions of Dollars to the high-tech companies that donate Millions of Dollars to certain politicians.  </p>
<p>Now that one group of corrupt businessmen have received their plunder of taxpayer money (i.e., Virtual Fence I), it is time for a second group to cash in (Virtual Fence II), by selling drones or thermal imagers or some other military application to Homeland inSecurity.</p>
<p>Of course they could have built a real fence or a real double-fence or a real triple-fence long ago, at much cheaper prices.  But then, how would their greedy business-buddies have gotten their money?  </p>
<p>Note that we can build ~ 4,000 miles of new road each year in the USA, but  we can&rsquo;t build a simple 2,000 mi fence in 40 years.   Heck, we spend more money protecting the borders of Korea, Iraq, &amp; Afghanistan than we do our own country.   </p>

It could mean thermal imaging in one area and elements of the old SBInet plan in another.&#8221; Yes, the towers are probably for monitoring the border guards making sure they are welcoming the illegals as the drones drop food, water and medical supplies to insure the illegals have a nice comfortable trip as they invade the United States.</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t suppose to work. This was just a show for the concerned US citizens about border security. Now that Obama is in re-election mode, the hispanic population will come out in droves to vote for him since he wants to make them all legal. When I mean &#8220;all&#8221; I mean everyone from left leaning areas of the world. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s working. Some years down the road the democratic party will be the main dominant party due to the millions of hispanic added to their roles. It&rsquo;s so so obvious what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Stupid republicans   &mdash;   I can&rsquo;t believe it. Thought they we&rsquo;re going to make a difference, but I was wrong. </p>

		<p>Greece is building a 12k border fence on its frontier with Turkey.</p>
<p>Other countries with fences: </p>
<p>Botswana 480k, Brunei 20k, Cyprus 180k, India-Bangladesh 3400k, India-Kashmir 550k, India-Burma 1624k, Iran-Pakistan 700k, Israel-West Bank 670k, Western Sahara 2500k, Pakistan-Afghanistan 2400k, Saudi Arabia-Iraq 900k, Kuwait-Iraq 190k, China-N.Korea 1416k. </p>
<p>These countries are Third World, yet they&rsquo;re not deterred from adressing national security by their limitations. India alone has completed almost 6000k of fencing. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for lack of skill or money that the United States can&rsquo;t get its 3360k border wall finished. </p>

		<p>Of course, the TSA can can plan for 60,000 or so personnel with their x-ray scanners to screen American citizens at airports in increasingly intrusive ways  &mdash;  while not catching a single terrorist in the process.  But forget about securing America&rsquo;s southern frontiers. The border is open to any number of illegal crossers, criminal cartels and perhaps even terrorist infiltration.</p>

		<p>It would cost us somewhere between $2 to 3 million per mile to build a real fence.  That means one that is well built, double row, with anti-vehicle ditches and an access road in the middle.  With approximately 2,000 miles along the U.S. - Mexican border it would cost us no more than $4 - 6 billion.  Considering what we have wasted so far, we could already have built a permanent fence along the entire border of Arizona.  </p>

<p>Note also that in 10 years we sent a man to the moon, and in 4 years, we built 20,000 tanks, 40,000 airplanes, 2,000 ships, and beat both Germany and Japan in WWII.  In 4 years we built the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me that in 40 years we can&rsquo;t build a simple fence.  The reason they refuse to build the fence is because they want illegal immigration.   </p>

		<p>#6 Californian, thank you! I&rsquo;ve been saying the very same thing since the ludicrous the TSA screenings were instituted.</p>
<p>The virtual fence would only EVER return virtual results. If money is the problem, (it is, but different money than the cost of building the fence) I know loads of people that would do it for nothing!</p>

		<p>Our imaginary Homeland Security Secretary has now killed our imaginary virtual border fence  &mdash;  as more and more American citizens and their jobs die at the hands of illegals. </p>

		<p>Yes the Republican party is truly the stupid party.  They have followed the Jeb Bush model of trying to bring Mexicans into the GOP.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pure fantasy to think that Mexicans will vote for republicans in great numbers.  About 30 percent max in a good election year, and that&rsquo;s about it. </p>
<p>In an interview on Univision old Jeb mentioned, with what appeared to be with some glee, that Hispanics will be the swing voters within a few years, not only in Texas but also Kansas and as far north as Wisconsin and Michigan.  </p>
<p>Not once in the interview did Jeb mention the need and right of the US to restrict immigration.   </p>
<p>The upcoming 2012 elections will likely be the last time the GOP will carry Texas.  Forget 2016.  The game is over. We will have a regional Republican party consisting of some deep south states and a few western ones.  </p>
<p>If you think Nancy&rsquo;s house was a mess the last four years, this is what you will get forever starting in about 2014.  The US will be the new Brazil, one part slave and the other small part rich.  That is, if we&rsquo;re lucky. </p>
<p>Of course the Virtual fence was as farce. It was a legal way to steal millions of dollars not only for corporations but for politicians and their friends as well.  </p>
<p>The fence, like everything else DHS-TSA and CBP does it&rsquo;s only virtual, it&rsquo;s not really there; virtual border security, virtual air travel security, virtual quality recruiting, and virtual quality training and leadership.   <br>

<b>Wow, authorizing National Guard deployment to the border. What a change, what hope, what difference would it make? Unless the NG is deployed in numbers over 30,000, armed and authorized to make arrests, their impact will and has been minimal.Other than mandating E-Verify, most of these bills, few with any chance of passing, would make any real difference. There aren&rsquo;t really that many anchor babies. None of these bills would identify or remove any great number of illegal aliens.</b><br>
