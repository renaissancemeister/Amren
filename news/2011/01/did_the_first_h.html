			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Hutchison, London Telegraph, December 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Modern man may have evolved in the Middle East rather than Africa, it has been claimed, after the discovery of remains said to be more than 400,000 years old.</p>
<p>Israeli researchers claimed to have found eight human-like teeth in the Qesem cave near Rosh Ha&rsquo;Ayin, 10 miles from Israel&rsquo;s Ben Gurion airport.</p>
<p>Archaeologists from Tel Aviv University said the teeth were 400,000 years old, from the Middle Pleistocene Age, which would make them the earliest remains of homo sapiens yet discovered in the world.</p>
<p>If true it overturns the belief that homo sapiens, the direct descendant of modern man, evolved in Africa about 200,000 years ago.</p>
<p>According to the &#8220;Out of Africa&#8221; theory, homo sapiens gradually migrated north, through the Middle East, to Europe and Asia between 70,000 and 50,000 years ago.</p>
<p>But in recent years discoveries in Spain and China have also questioned the theory that man originated in Africa.</p>
<p>The latest findings, published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, said the size and shape of the teeth were very similar to those of modern man.</p>
<p>Prof Avi Gopher and Dr Ran Barkai of the Institute of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University also found evidence of the use of fire, hunting, and the cutting and mining of raw materials to produce flint tools, which suggested a sophisticated form of society.</p>
<p>They said further research was needed to solidify their claim but if proven it &#8220;changes the whole picture of evolution&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t we all familiar with the look that comes across the face of whomever we are talking to when they realize that we are &#8220;raciss&#8221;?</p>
<p>In these frustrating times of White dispossession, I find that my comments come much faster in race conversations, so I&rsquo;m seeing that horrified look sooner than usual.</p>
<p>Most recently, I see it when I get around to saying &#8220;You may have come out of Africa, but I didn&rsquo;t.  Look at yourself. What of Africa do you see there?&#8221;</p>
<p>They flee me as soon as possible, but I know I&rsquo;ve planted a fruitful seed of race reality.</p>

		<p>As new evidence is found, theories naturally modify.  This is not proof of the weakness of science, but how science is supposed to work.  I have been waiting for years for these recent findings.  As the tundra melts (for whatever reason) I expect new finds to come to light in more northern regions as in the latest Siberian find.  Repeated Ice Ages would have ground up a great deal of evidence buried it in far less accessible places than the Rift Valley of Kenya.</p>
<p>Another assumption is that the earliest people were black.  This is not necessarily true.  Today&rsquo;s negro dna is the most stable, meaning that it is the least changed or EVOLVED.  Since it is so old, its genetic characteristics are often dominant while the more recent ones, such as light skin, blue eyes and red hair are recessive.  That only means that negro genes are the least differentiated, or modified, or mutated.  Mutation is the way genetic traits, negative and positive are formed physiologically.  Whether a mutation is beneficial to survival is how natural selection assists evolution.  The traits for more melanin production and other features, including disease complexes (like Sickle Cell Anemia which resists malaria), could have been earlier mutations, even though the earliest homo erectus could have had lighter skin and because of a more difficult, even shorter life in more temperate climates, mutated more often and so is the latest product of evolution.  This is  pointed to in the book, &#8220;Before the Dawn,&#8221; a late DNA study of prehistoric genetics, endorsed by E. O. Watson (the geneticist who was fired in England a few years ago for saying blacks were genetically inferior).</p>

		<p>When I was in elementary schools they taught about the Fertile Crescent. An area in the Middle East where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are, where man came from. Skip a few years a head and the liberal indoctrination society is pressing the life out of Africa bull in schools. Liberal pro-black feminist are our real enemy. Teaching our children to hate themselves and put themselves last in line, to make the down trodden feel better about themselves.</p>

		<p>We don&rsquo;t (yet) speak often in the fashion of the old USSR<br>
of &#8220;rehabilitating&#8221; our courageous scientists that discover<br>
the perils of &#8220;tellig it like it is&#8221;.  But in terms of these<br>
mounting reservations about the Out of Africa hypothesis having<br>
long ago won by a KO over alternative hypotheses,  it might<br>
be a just thing to re-view Carleton Coon&rsquo;s ORIGIN OF RACES.<br>
My own very imperfect understanding is that Coon&rsquo;s theory would have to be considerably modified to have any place at the table of rational and informed discourse today.  But up to now, it has been noted, if at all, as discredited, discredited.  Justice?</p>

		<p>#1 Whiteplight:  I can&rsquo;t find any references to E O Watson.  Did you mean Prof James Watson? He was the joint Nobel prize winner for discovering the structure of DNA, and he lost his job for saying that there is no firm reason to expect that people who evolved separately should have evolved identically, and all the testing indicates that in fact they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The recent sequencing of the Neanderthal genome indicates that we share some genes with them, as do all other races except Africans.</p>
<p>Interesting book available for download: <a href="https://erectuswalksamongst.us/" rel="nofollow">Erectus Walks Amongst Us</a>. Probably not endorsed by James Watson. Argues against the Out of Africa hypothesis.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care if the first humans were African.  We separated from them a long time ago and are our own people.  The findings have not undergone any DNA tests yet.  I remain skeptical.</p>
<p>Like most things the Chinese imitated an early European evolution hypothesis that Europeans evolved from a separate species of humans.  The Chinese have nothing, no evidence they came from a separate human species.</p>
<p>Whiteplight, Europeans have a different genetic makeup for light skin than non-white people including East Asians.</p>

		<p>Any DNA test will show that Erectus migrated OA to the ME then evoled into AMH and migrated back to SSA meaning that R1b, J, E &amp; others are Caucasian (which reclaims our legacy in Egypt and solidifies it in modern Ethiopia &amp; Somalia) OR this lineage sired some/all non-Afro Eurasian haplogroups OR it&rsquo;ll totally vindicate Old Man Coon potentially to the extent of reviving mainstream racial realism.

		<p>What does this imply about sub-Saharan Africans?  Does it mean that they are not homo sapiens?  Or that a branch of homo sapiens re-migrated into Africa to form the black race?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to know the full TRUTH about our genetic relationship to blacks, if it is not suppressed.  We are in a very tenuous time for civilization.  If scientists do not soon arrive at and expose the full truth about genetics, then Western Civilization may actually lose the ability to understand and disseminate it.  It could go down a memory hole.</p>

		<p><i> E. O. Watson (the geneticist who was fired in England a few years ago for saying blacks were genetically inferior).</i></p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve got E.O.<i>Wilson</i> confused with James <i>Watson</i>, although E.O. has experienced his share of grief as well:</p>
<p><i>Wilson was accused of racism, misogyny, and eugenics. In one incident, a female member of the International Committee Against Racism poured a pitcher of water on Wilson&rsquo;s head and chanted &#8216;Wilson, you&rsquo;re all wet&rsquo; at a AAAS conference&hellip; Wilson later spoke of the incident as a source of pride: &#8216;I believe&hellip;I was the only scientist in modern times to be physically attacked for an idea.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>As for James Watson:</p>
<p><i>On October 25, 2007, Watson was compelled to retire as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on New York&rsquo;s Long Island and from its board of directors, after Watson had been quoted in The Times the previous week as saying &#8220;[I am] inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa [because] all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours &mdash; whereas all the testing says not really.</i></p>
<p>BTW:  Both are Americans.</p>
<p>Hope that clears it up.</p>

		<p>To # 1, Paying the Price. No I do not have that problem, ie. people being embarrased and shying away from me when I express my views and concerns about issues such as race or another boatload of illegal immigrants or my concern about yet another mosque or temple going up. In fact the usual response I seem to get is something like this; &#8220;&hellip; I feel that way also except we are not allowed to say so these days&#8221;</p>
<p>It is very sad that so much of the West has been brainwashed into  a craven cowardly &amp; tame society where free speech and the exchange of ideas has been silenced.</p>
<p>To # 3.Agree with you completely about the origins of civilisation and life itself being in the Fertile Cresent. Most archeology finds still support this. By contrast it simply amazes me that the whole of human history and civilization is able to be re-written following the discovery of just a few fragments of a skull in Kenya&rsquo;s Rift Valley.<br>

		<p>Whiteplight, you&rsquo;re right, the earliest humans are unlikely to have been black-skinned, because none of the primates who are our closest relatives have black skin.  Under their fur they&rsquo;re light-skinned, like us.  Early proto-humans were likely light-skinned, as well.  Black skin in Africans would have been a later adaptation to living under the strong equatorial sun with no hair to protect them from its effects.  Skin color correlates pretty perfectly with how far away one&rsquo;s ancestors lived from the equator - the closer to the equator, the darker the skin, simple as that. </p>

		<p>Unless and until the DNA is sequenced - and that&rsquo;s highly unlikely given the age of the teeth - there is little reason to think this discovery pushes back the age of &#8220;modern man.&#8221; The current understanding is that Homo sapiens sapiens evolved its basic template in Africa, ca. 200,000 years ago. Y chromosome and mtDNA sequencing seem to back this up, with Y chromosome &#8220;Adam&#8221; and mitochondrial &#8220;Eve&#8221; both appearing somewhere in Africa prior to 70k years ago (though not necessarily at the same time). </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the end, though, for those of us who understand that, yes, blacks and whites are quite different. After leaving Africa with this basic template, mankind encountered its cousins who had been living and evolving separately in Asia and Europe for hundreds of thousands of years. These encounters (the sexual kind, anyway) appear to have left a genetic imprint on the ancestors of everyone <i>but</i> blacks, with one study concluding 1-4% of the DNA of non-Africans comes from Neanderthals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that this new discovery changes our understanding of things, but I highly doubt that it will.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;out of africa&#8221; theory is a joke. It was disproven within weeks of its release. It was simply more afrocentrist propaganda. As an example they say 65000 years ago, witch was in the middle of a major ice age, modern man adapted to tropical conditions left africa and moved north into a frozen wasteland, while the populations adapted to the colder climates were fleeing southward. Add to that that the people living in the colder climates had more advanced weapons and tools, and the &#8220;out of africa theory&#8221; falls completely apart.<br>
All in all the Multi Regional Theory stands up much better to scrutiny although it will never be as attractive to the multiculturalists.</p>

		<p>A few human like teeth discovered in the Middle East and dated to about 400,000 years ago is less impressive evidence than complete skeletons that indicate that modern humans evolved in Africa from homo erectus at least 100,000 years ago and left Africa at least 65,000 years ago. <br>
 <br>
It is well known that homo erectus individuals left Africa about a million years ago, and evolved into Neanderthals. The &#8220;human like teeth&#8221; are probably those of Neanderthals. <br>
 <br>
In addition to fossil evidence, blacks have more genetic diversity than Caucasians and east Asians. That fact is impressive DNA evidence that the out of Africa theory still holds. </p>

		<p>black genes are the most stable, and dominant? When a black and a white interbreed, the product is not black, but lighter in skin tone, and if the child breeds with a white the offspring is lighter still. Ever see a child of a black father and white mother as black as the father? That we all came out of Africa is nonsense. Where did the Neanderthals come from? More proof that modern humans interbred with them surfaces regularly. Now evidence that may pre-date the so called out of Africa migration by 300 thousand years. If whites evolved from blacks, can you explain that? If there was a variation and one or two black offspring were conceived, how did that continue? Until whites and asians suddenly appeared by the thousands. If white and asian came from blacks, why no sickle cell anemia, where did such variation in eye and hair color among whites come from? I knew a man that had a black father and a Japanese mother. His hair was straight, his skin was much lighter than his father&rsquo;s and his eyes had much more of an asian than black shape. This variation was introduced from the mother, not the father. If all blacks were to in the future conceive only with whites, and there children only with whites, in a few generations there would be no blacks. Obviously blacks were isolated and never migrated anywhere.</p>

		<p>What has been the position vis a vis Out of Africa of the<br>
multi-regionalists, until recently centered from the Ann Arbor<br>
campus??  I have found no record of these people sitting down<br>
around a large round table to discuss their viewpoints with the<br>
OoA adherents.  I am aware that Roger Pearson (Mankind Quarterly )<br>
long pointed to the likelihood that whatever emerged OoA would<br>
have encountered and been interfertile with those emerging<br>
regionally. To assume otherwise, is to imply a massive and on-going  genocide basic to keeping OoA unaffected by the regionally evolved forms encountered.  As nearly as I can surmise, the infusion of genes<br>
of regional life forms into the OoA migration is now presumed to<br>
be not so much an infusion as a here and there sprinkling.  ??</p>

		<p>Several folks have recommended books. If the subject interests you at all (and I think it should) two terrific books you can read, perfectably suitable for non-scientists, are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Before-Dawn-Recovering-History-Ancestors/dp/014303832X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b" rel="nofollow">Before the Dawn</a>, by Nicholas Wade, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/000-Year-Explosion-Civilization-Accelerated/dp/0465020429/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1294346986&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">The 10,000 Year Explosion</a>, by Henry Harpending and Gregory Cochran.</p>
<p>Both are likely to be found in and decent-sized public library. Harpending&rsquo;s book is especially vicious about taking the garotte to the &#8220;we&rsquo;re all the same&#8221; pablum of the multicult.</p>
