			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meg Jones, Journal Sentinel (Milwaukee), January 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mayfair Mall [in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin] closed down early on Sunday afternoon as New Year&rsquo;s weekend shoppers were told to leave after witnesses reported seeing groups of unruly young people shouting and running in the Wauwatosa shopping center.</p>
<p>There also were unsubstantiated reports of gunfire.</p>
<p>Elsa Mercado was trying on clothes in a fitting room at Ann Taylor Loft when she heard loud noises. Her sister was at another store, and when Mercado tried to leave to check on her, she discovered she was locked in as some of the stores brought down their security gates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone was pounding on our door and saying, &#8216;Please let me in. There&rsquo;s gunfire.&rsquo; We unlocked the door and let him in. He was very frightened, he was very pale,&#8221; said Mercado, who used her cell phone to call 911.</p>
<p>Mercado said the 911 dispatcher asked her location.</p>
<p>&#8220;They wanted to know where I was; it seemed like they had gotten a lot of calls throughout the mall,&#8221; said Mercado, who saw a group of rowdy young people she estimated to number around 100. &#8220;It was happening throughout the entire mall. It was not isolated to one part of the mall.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Mayfair Mall official said in an e-mailed statement late Sunday {snip} &#8220;What occurred this afternoon appears to be a group of youth intent on disrupting the shopping experience at Mayfair. The safety and security of our visitors are always our top priority. This behavior is isolated and we will not condone it,&#8221; Mayfair Senior General Manager Steve Smith said in the statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;To assist police earlier in identifying and apprehending suspects, we made the decision to close the mall shortly before our regular closing time,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;We anticipate there will be consequences as a result of what happened today.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several Wauwatosa police squad cars were sent to the mall. Police at the scene said they were not allowed to speak to the media and a police dispatcher refused to provide any details. The dispatcher said no information would be released until Monday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Laura Hughes was in the Barnes &amp; Noble bookshop when she heard screaming and the sound of a large group of people running. She walked out the second floor of the bookseller and &#8220;saw large sums of teenagers running towards Boston Store and going down the escalators to the first level. Mall security had been chasing some of the kids, followed by police officers, who were literally herding the kids downstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>So now Milwaukee!  These &#8220;flash&#8221; incidents are getting to be rather common, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>And this was Wauwatosa, a nice suburb at that, not even in Milwaukee! </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have hundreds of &#8220;youths&#8221; rioting just spontaneously;  this must be planned and coordinated. And I wonder where these, uh, <i> &#8220;kids&#8221;</i> and <i> &#8220;unruly young people&#8221;</i> are from?</p>
<p>Whoever is behind this, I hope the police identify them and get to the core of it.</p>

		<p>Following on the heels of the couple beaten at the movies in Florida, this appears to be a growing trend. What else but the election of Obama (along with Holder&rsquo;s refusal to prosecute crimes against whites) would cause such arrogance?</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somehow, I don&rsquo;t believe so.</p>

		<p>Note the use of  common buzz words such as &#8220;youth&#8221; and characterizing it as &#8220;isolated&#8221;. Then they go into information blackout mode. This seems to be standard operating procedure for government agencies and the media. When pressed, the usual routine is to bring out an alleged &#8220;expert&#8221; who will then describe criminality like this as being some sort of cry of anguish from the downtrodden. Wildings, flash mobs, or just old fashioned race rioting have been such a regular feature of American life one&rsquo;s eyes just glaze over whenever there&rsquo;s another one. Wasn&rsquo;t Obama supposed to inspire all of these &#8220;youth&#8221; into solving world hunger rather than doing smash and run type crimes?  </p>

		<p>You guys dropped the ball with this article. You should have linked to Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like&rsquo;s account on the Mayfair Mall riot. </p>
<p>It was all Black people who took part in this ordeal. </p>

<p>Start reading that blog more and you&rsquo;ll have better stories to link to instead of the boring white person murdered by Black/Hispanic etc&hellip;</p>
<p>We know Blacks are violent, but websites like Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like help explain why in a hilarious manner.</p>

		<p>If his buddy, Gates, was important enough to slander cops over and have a &#8220;beer summit&#8221; with all attending publicity, why aren&rsquo;t the two recent &#8220;wilding&#8221; incidents (Florida and Milwaukee) worth a speech &#8220;to the black community&#8221; (the way he&rsquo;s always talking to the &#8220;muslim community.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Of course the media are censoring race.  But thank goodness for the New York Times and its Census Explorer  I called up the location of Mayfair Mall on Google Maps, then asked the NYT Census Explorer to show black census tracts in the general area of Mayfair Mall. </p>
<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t you know it   &mdash;   Milwaukee&rsquo;s ghettos are a short distance due east of the mall along a major arterial boulevard; I&rsquo;m guessing there&rsquo;s a public bus route between the two.  There are majority black tracts directly north, and the adjoining single tract south of the tract which contains this mall is majority black.</p>
<p>Then again, this foolishness isn&rsquo;t long for this world, at least in the context of Wisconsin.  Scott Walker became Governor yesterday.  Can you say carry bill?  This mall in question is a General Growth Properties mall, and none of the GGP malls in St. Louis disallow CCW.  Now, let&rsquo;s hope that this mall stays off DeadMalls.com long enough for CCW to do it any good.</p>
<p>As an aside, Mayfair Mall already had a &#8220;Parental Guidance&#8221; policy forcing people under 17 to have parental or adult supervision after certain hours and on certain days.  These are the sorts of polices malls all over the country are adopting in reaction to wildings or in fear of them.  Now we have evidence that they are ineffective.</p>

They must have done something to bring this on themselves?<br>
Maybe they asked one of the fine black children to pay for the things he had put in his pockets? Now if that isn&rsquo;t racism I sure don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>

		<p>What whites build blacks eventually have to destroy. Not all blacks, of course, but enough of them that a nice retail district eventually becomes economically unfeasible.</p>
<p>We have a strip in the Miller Beach area of Gary that was once a growing retail district. Now it&rsquo;s almost entirely an industrial area, dotted by an occasional strip club or abandoned shopping center.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a spate of black mini riots since early summer, and over what? Absolutely nothing. With Obama in office, the old excuse that blacks riot because of &#8220;injustice&#8221; rings hollow. And so the media blackout continues. </p>
<p>Will the riots ever become frequent enough and persistent enough that even the average comatose white American becomes aware of what is happening? Only time will tell.</p>

		<p> Whenever the news media carefully avoids specifying &#8220;race,&#8221; rest assured, the &#8220;youths&#8221; were black. This is cowardly and dishonest journalism   &mdash;   and typical of the way the media averts its eyes from mass misbehavior by blacks in this society.</p>
<p> When some White person or persons can plausibly be branded &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;bigoted&#8221; or a &#8220;hater,&#8221; today&rsquo;s reporters break a leg getting there to do it. When the malefactors are of a darker shade, race becomes the 800-pound gorilla in the room: We know he&rsquo;s there, but nobody dares say so out loud.</p>

		<p>If it was better organized, it would be a great way to draw off security and achieve some real theft.  The &#8216;back and forth&rsquo; effect is especially telling.</p>
<p>Assuming it was a pack of black or hispanic teenaged girls as the story suggests (do white girls &#8216;bark&rsquo; while pushing over clothing racks?) the question becomes whether they are standalones or a junior division of a bigger male gang and what specific type of ritual initiation they might have been &#8216;gotta take it&rsquo; been playing at.</p>
<p>I find the whole corporate attitude of the Mall General Manager rather disheartening.  It doesn&rsquo;t help the cops to lose witnesses and arbitrarily sealing doors and disabling transport mechanisms while declaring a large shopping complex closed is begging for trouble if the riot becomes extensive or if a crime is accompanied by the likes of arson to add to the confusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not all that thrilling to hear that yet another &#8216;safe&rsquo; midwest location has been overrun, not just by criminal youth but also by the cosmopolitan likes of &#8216;Rubina Shafi&rsquo; and &#8216;Elsa Mercado&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Finally, what does it say that teenagers of any kind can get a gun?  I couldn&rsquo;t even -afford- one until my mid-twenties.  Guns make it organized.  Guns mean there is an adult involved, either with contacts for stolen weapons or licensing.</p>
<p>Gunfire from mallcops is even worse&hellip;</p>

		<p>At some point the media will realize that people already know the race of the rioters without being told, at which they will just stop reporting these events altogether.  Can anyone picture this type of event happening anywhere else in the world by anyone other than American blacks?  Perhaps this type of spontaneous black riot will spread to western Europe much like the car burnings in France.  This has nothing to do with poverty, racism or any other excuse that the apologists can come up with.  It&rsquo;s like a force of nature, like a tornado or rogue wave that just appears out of nowhere and for no reason other than destruction and terror.  It is anti-society and anti-white at it&rsquo;s core.   </p>

		<p>The news media all over this country have hidden the fact that it was a large group of blacks on another wilding.  Cell phones will provide the evidence:  https://www.wisn.com/video/26354529/detail.html</p>
<p>How does hiding the fact that young blacks are out of control in this country ever going to help race relations?  Where are all of the so-called black leaders?  One day in the not too distant future this type of behavior will become quite acceptable and expected.  Out of the two hundred or so gangsters only 9 arrests so far.  That is what Wisconsin and Milwaukee get for being liberal and encouraging diversity. </p>

		<p>I lived in Milwaukee during my childhood and have fond memories of the Mayfair Mall. There used to be a large ice skating rink there. It was such a nice mall and you never for one second were concerned about your safety. An incident like this never would have happened.</p>
<p>We also shopped at a mall called Northridge. It was booming in the 70s. It was also very safe, I dont even think we locked the car door. After I left in the 80s they built a public housing project in the area. By the early 90s the mall became very dangerous. Teens were running around the mall causing trouble and shoplifting. There were shootings and black female gang members were stabbing customers in the parking lot. It got so bad they had to close the mall. If Mayfair doesn&rsquo;t control the violence it will become the next Northridge, if it&rsquo;s not too late already.</p>

		<p>I live close to Mayfair Mall and have been there many times. It is a slightly upscale place - nice by mall standards - but it is hampered by increasing numbers of &#8220;youths&#8221; who negate the shopping experience. </p>
<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t mention race but the troublemakers are all black. It has gotten worse year after year. Inner city kids with time to kill take the bus to the mall and hang out and increasingly harass white people. Crime, including robbery, car break-ins, and shoplifting, is covered-up. Meanwhile, the mall has tried to institute a more restrictive policy on teens but had to compromise in the face of cries of racism. </p>
<p>The Journal-Sentinel comments from readers on the articles related to this ugly incident are telling. It&rsquo;s like reading AmRen. People are really getting fed up with blacks behaving like animals. </p>
<p>It is the same old story. No parental guidance; dumb, impulsive black teens; and an inability to function in a civil society. With the billions of dollars spent over 50 years you&rsquo;d think this type of lunacy would have been put to rest. Instead, it is only becoming more pervasive.</p>
<p>I know many people who hesitate going to Mayfair Mall because of feeling unsafe with brainless black thugs roaming around. With this latest incident more people will turn away. This is how it starts - the slow decline to insolvency thanks to blacks who seem to destroy all they come in contact with.   </p>
<p>The mall really needs to clamp down and begin a no teen policy unless accompanied by an adult - at all times. Prosecute troublemakers all the way. And increase security and even police patrols. When howls of racism appear the mall management will just have to let it go and stay focused. The survival of the mall itself depends on it.</p>

		<p>  There is a mall, or I should say there was a mall in Dayton, Ohio that had a majority of blacks that rode the buses to it on a daily basis. It was called the Salem Mall. After years of trouble from these &#8220;yoofs&#8221;, the clientele finally gave up on shopping in safety and abandoned the mall. After a few years, it was torn down and forgotten. Two more malls in the suburbs of Cincinnati are experiencing the exact same trouble. Northgate mall and Cincinnati mills have alot of problems with minorities causing trouble. Cincinnati mills is almost completely empty now. It was built between Fairfield and Forset Park. Forest Park is a majority black enclave of Cincinnati. Northgate mall is in the news weekly for trouble from these perps. Combined with a weak economy and racial trouble, this will be a death knoll for alot of the malls in the Midwest.</p>

		<p>There are several &#8220;what had been&#8221; very nice malls in the Kansas City area.<br>
I live in Iowa but always enjoyed the trip to shop there.<br>
As I was leaving my room at the Crown Center Hotel the desk clerk asked what I had planned for the day.<br>
I said I was going to these malls, he laughed and said they are gone &#8220;torn down&#8221; because of an influx of blacks. The first step of these people was to HARASS white females, then to try to intimidate white males, pretty soon the whites quit risking the trip so they stopped coming. Then the number of blacks who seem to like to shop (lift) but hate to pay drove the merchants out of businees and the INVADERS moved on to their next victim..</p>

		<p>I for one do not buy into this slur of our fine young black population.<br>
Where I shop there are more and more blacks everyday and I for one find them delightful.<br>
They are very quick to point out a white female with large breasts. Or tell my grandaughter about things they would like to do to her and they are Very Helpful. As an example if a lady sets her purse down one of these fine black youths will grab it an run away so that she isn&rsquo;t bothered carrying such a heavy load. </p>

		<p> This behavior is isolated and we will not condone it,&rdquo; Mayfair Senior General Manager Steve Smith said in the statement.</p>
<p>LIAR!!  You will condone it.  We all know you will.  Out of fear of being labled the horrific &#8216;r&rsquo; word you will condone it.  Right to the day the doors to the mall are locked forever (soon) because the law abiding shoppers are forced out, you will condone it.

		<p>Try to imagine that there is no Internet. No one would have known about this incident. Only local news media would report it. THe Internet with its blogs, forums, YouTube etc. has given us access to all major and local media both radio, TV and print and thanks to sites like AMREN, Drudge etc., we have links to these media. <br>
Were there no Internet we would have no clue as to the direct threats to our safety and future. </p>
<p>At least 40 years ago, three YOUTHS entered a West Philadelphia Home occupied by an grandmother, mother and young teenage daughter.  Their name was Alexandroff and were of Russian Orthodox Heritage. The young girl upon arriving home from school that afternoon evidently had an armful of books and forgot to take the key out of the lock on the front door.  The &#8220;youths&#8221; with their keen predatory instincts seized the opportunity and for hours during the night subjected the three women to hideous butality including horrendous sexual degradation. They had been watching the girl and that was their motivation. One of the women was penetrated with a broomstick. I believe it was the grandmother who ultimately died of her injuries. The mother and the girl were raped and sodomized numerous times in addition to being beaten. <br>
One of the three youths was sentenced to death but as far as I know, is still eating on the Commonwealth&rsquo;s dime at Graterford Penitentiary.<br>
I had heard that the teenage girl was sent to a psychiatric facility due to the trauma she had suffered.</p>
<p>NOne one outside the reach of the then Evening Bulletin, Inquirer and Daily News knew anything about the case.</p>
<p>That situation still exists today for those who are still in LALA land when it comes to being informed, I was surprised at how many people I know didn&rsquo;t have any idea about what happened in Knoxville, Wichita and Charleston. Their use of the Internet is limited to music and sports ( the new &#8220;Opiate of the people&#8221;. They have yet to realize that what you don&rsquo;t know CAN INDEED hurt you.</p>
<p>The government appears to be poised to gain more control over the Net. Their declared motivation is &#8220;fairness&#8221; and to protect children from Pornography.  I&rsquo;m beginning to believe that their real agenda is to eliminate sites such as this  to keep us unaware and ignorant of how much danger we&rsquo;re in from their vast underclass of uncivilized minorities that they&rsquo;ve unleashed upon us. <br>

		<p>@anon3:19AM I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that the Journal-Sentinel reader comments on this story that were similar to what you would read on AmRen were getting lot&rsquo;s of thumbs up. While all the politically correct comments (such as &#8220;you are a bunch of racists this has nothing to do with skin color&#8221;) got major thumbs down. Could it be that people are waking up and no longer believe the poltically correct messages the MSM constantly program the masses with?</p>

		<p>I lived near Richmond, Virginia for a while in the late 80s/early 90s. At the time, there were two major malls. Cloverleaf was right outside the city of Richmond and was known as &#8220;the black mall.&#8221; There was another mall in the suburbs (Midlothian) that was known as the white mall (I cannot recall the name of it however).</p>
<p>My brother still lives near there and I went to the &#8220;white mall&#8221; last year. It is now the black mall as Richmond blacks take the bus there and whites have largely left. The new white mall is way out in the country in Short Pump. It is a beautiful, outdoor structure (which apparently helps keep blacks away in the winter).</p>
<p>But the fact is, malls in &#8220;enriched&#8221; areas probably only have 20 year life spans no matter how nice they are. Today&rsquo;s white mall will become the black mall in 15 years and be out of business in 20 years.</p>

		<p>I think it will be very interesting to see the future of shopping malls in this country.</p>
<p>Obviously shopping malls in borderline areas are out of the question.</p>
<p>But what about areas that are mainly white (at least for now)?</p>
<p>Will white people fight to stop construction of future malls knowing what magnets they are for minorities? And will they back down when the charges of racism quickly follow? <br>

		<p>Can someone build a mall -inside- a covenant sealed (gated) community and  get away with &#8216;raciss&rsquo; denial of entry based on strict governance regs for behavior and/or property value tax codes or does zoning screw that all up?</p>
<p>How big a customer base (as acreage) would such a town-center type miniplex of say Barnes &amp; Noble, Starbucks, Nordstroms, North Face, maybe a Sportsbar and Restaurant or 3-4 screen AMC theater require?</p>
<p>Not a &#8216;real mall&rsquo; because you don&rsquo;t need that kind of size.  But something along the lines of ten storefronts where you could either look at the latest on the racks or mail order for 2-3 day guaranteed delivery from a larger in-state warehouse at a much smaller storefront &#8216;discount&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Could you do it within a 250 person, bedroom, community with million dollar homes?</p>
<p>That seems to be the next logical step given the first time one of these darlings hurts an actual -rich person- or their kid, there will be some serious &#8216;adjustments&rsquo; required.</p>
<p>Obviously, the adult residents can screen selected guests and childhood friends for one-time admission and even put them on a permanent customer list, simply by having a separate gated entrance.  Which would frankly help a lot with zoning, particularly if you also have electric cab or bus service from parking lots that aren&rsquo;t right in the face of the resident&rsquo;s views (multilevel subterranean garages come to mind) as property values across the street or golf course.</p>
<p>It seems to me, just on the failure of economies of scale, that the days of the big malls are probably numbered anyway.  Prices cannot compete and the only people making money are the restaurants and specialized stores.</p>
<p>Cherry Creek here is virtually unpopulated except during the holiday sales, in no small part due to the growing black clientelle who come streaming in their hordes out of the cheap condos on the old Lowry AFB holdings.</p>
<p>Yet the smaller Cherry Creek North _just across the street_ still has a decent clientelle and some higher end boutique type stores in a Main Street controlled-stroll external storefront environment.</p>
<p>The same goes for Park Meadows which was intended to be &#8216;Cherry Creek South&rsquo; (upscale nature) and yet is so sprawled an so expensive the only people who go there are windowshoppers looking for a workout.  This compared to say Southlands-</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shopsouthlands.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.shopsouthlands.com/</a></p>
<p>Though Southlands also has a lot of the larger chain stores (Wallmart, Home Depot) either in the center or adjoining it and Aurora itself is not the community it once was.</p>
<p>There has to be a way, beyond resorting to a trapped, online-shopped, existence, for whites to gather and socialize, exclusively, without terrible fear or repressed frustration.</p>
<p>Flash mobbing will get worse as the economy disintegrates and people who think otherwise will be left wondering how they get out of the madhouse environment.</p>

		<p>To Jay (poster #19) who shares my name, apparently.  </p>
<p>I concur with what you report, though from a different state.</p>
<p>As a youth, the Pontiac Mall was the place to go.  There were some blacks there, but they were a small minority at that site, which is located some distance from the city center.</p>
<p>About 15 years ago &#8216;youths&rsquo; began overrunning the place.  Last time I was there, three years ago, it was literally a ghost town with most storefronts board up in the mall.  Huge sections were only dimly lit, and dangerous looking &#8216;youths&rsquo; were shuffling around in those places.</p>
<p>I left and never went back.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of two malls in the Memphis area, the Hickory Ridge Mall and the Mall of Memphis. When I first moved to Memphis in the 1980s, the Hickory Ridge Mall was in a mostly white suburb, and the area felt very safe and prosperous. A couple of years later, the suburb was annexed by the mostly black city. To make a long story short, the last time I saw this suburb in 2004, much of the store space was empty. A nearby grocery store had been closed and its windows were covered with plywood, and there were a lot of cars going by with pounding rap music coming out the windows. The Mall of Memphis was also mostly populated by whites back in the 80s. It was the largest mall in the Memphis area, and had one of the only ice rinks around. But the blacks began to move in there, too, and the Mall of Memphis finally closed on Christmas Eve, 2003.  </p>
