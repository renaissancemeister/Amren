<h1><a href="https://www.prudentbear.com/index.php/thebearslairview?art_id=10484">The Changing Face of 2050</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martin Hutchinson, The Bear&rsquo;s Lair, December 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Census Bureau issued the first results of the 2010 Census this week, showing that the U.S. growth in population in 2000-2010 was only 9.7%, the lowest decennial growth since the 1930s and the second lowest on record. {snip} However it has much more important effects on what kind of United States we will see in 2050, because the change in &#8220;slope&#8221; of the population curve makes a big difference to the outcome when extrapolated 40 years.</p>
<p>There is a &#8220;consensus&#8221; view of the United States in 2050, based partly on multi-culturalist wishful thinking and partly on extrapolation of the 13% population growth of the 1990s. The Census Bureau in 2009 estimated 2050 population at 439 million, but to the conventional thinkers that has always seemed too conservative  &mdash;  after all, if 1990-2000&rsquo;s population growth rate had been repeated over the succeeding five decades, the population in 2050 would have been 523 million. {snip}<br>
The new census result blows such predictions out of the water. Admittedly, if population increase were 9.7% per decade over each of the next four decades 2050&rsquo;s population would be 447 million, somewhat above the Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2009 projection. However the second derivative of population needs to be considered as well as the first. The slowing of growth in the 2000s should continue at least well into the 2010s, making future growth rates much lower than projected. Since the 1980s&rsquo; population growth was only 9.8%, barely higher than this decade&rsquo;s, and the trend had been steadily declining since the 1950s, it now appears that the 1990s growth of 13.2% was the anomaly, with the decade&rsquo;s population artificially boosted perhaps by the tech bubble and certainly by the succession of illegal immigrant amnesties passed after 1986.</p>
<p>If the second derivative of population, roughly constant from 1960 to 1990 as the decadal population growth rate declined from 13.3% in the 1960s to 11.5% in the 1970s to 9.8% in the 1980s, had stayed that way, then the trajectory of population would have led to 8.1% growth in the 1990s, 6.3% growth in the 2000s and a population of 285.8 million today  &mdash;  22.9 million below today&rsquo;s actual population. We can imagine the difference to be made up mostly of today&rsquo;s illegal immigrants, generally estimated at 12 million, plus the additional children born to the unexpectedly large immigrant population. In other words, the rapid population growth of 1990-2005 appears to have been a blip.</p>
<p>We can then project forward from 2010&rsquo;s actual number an &#8220;inherent&#8221; population growth, assuming a constant second derivative (minus the 1990-2005 blip) and tight immigration law enforcement, and get a U.S. population in 2050 of a mere 333 million, with a slight decline in the 2040-2050 period. That intuitively seems far too low, but with immigration law enforcement likely to tighten at least in the short term, a 2050 population of below 400 million certainly now looks plausible, with the demographic split only moderately changed from today&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Ignoring the social effects of changing demographics, the economic effect of a lower population growth rate is very considerable, and mostly positive. First, with only 90 million new inhabitants in the next 40 years compared with the previous estimate of 130 million plus, only two-thirds of the projected expenditure on schools, roads, housing, government offices and other infrastructure will be needed, saving perhaps $500 billion per annum (including housing and schools) in scarce capital resources that can be devoted to more economically productive capital investment in the nation&rsquo;s businesses.</p>
<p>Second, with 10% fewer people around in 2050, the endowment of land and capital will be 10% greater per capita. {snip} A slower rate of population growth in 2010-2050 implies a generally richer 2050, with higher per capita income growth and better opportunities at the bottom of the earnings pyramid, both unalloyed blessings.</p>
<p>Slower population growth will also affect education. With overall population perhaps 10% lower than projected, and annual growth maybe a third lower than projected, the resources of the education system will be ample for the needs of the new generation. {snip}</p>
<p>Needless to say, the lower projected population growth does not offer unalloyed benefit. In particular it will make the financial position of the Social Security and Medicare programs more difficult. {snip}</p>
<p>Two factors will alleviate this problem. First, with a wealthier population containing fewer poor people, the Medicaid program of medical care for the indigent will be correspondingly less troubled, while the subsidy necessary to Social Security and Medicare will be less pronounced. Second the reduced need for infrastructure spending will itself free up additional funding for these programs. However the most urgent policy need for the programs, made more necessary by the new demographic reality, is to continue the gradual raising of the retirement age beyond its current goal of 67 in 2026. {snip}</p>
<p>Finally, the new demographic projections have important implications in the area of foreign policy. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With the malign 1990s vision of rapid population growth, combined with the unpleasant reality of anemic economic performance as seen in the 2000s, the United States would by 2050 become a teeming melting-pot, with widespread poverty, high taxes to fund frantic infrastructure spending and the overcrowded poly-ethnic young unwillingly paying the welfare costs of the impoverished old. In the new version, with population growth finally under control, the United States of 2050 will be much richer, more harmonious and indeed happier  &mdash;  not a melting pot but a country club.<br>

<p>How could anyone White American be foolish enough to believe that with 450 million people of which probably about 65% will be non-White that a &#8220;country-club&#8221; will result?  This is the most reckless reasoning that I can imagine.</p>

		<p>The only thing worse than the privileged but stereotypically angry black person is a black person who has actual reason to be angry. I hope this isn&rsquo;t what the Charlotte school system is really trying to accomplish? I was just online reading Roger Ebert&rsquo;s movie reviews. They should do a movie and explore this topic. The privileged and deferred to angry black person who is angry about things that, surely they can in no way Really believe are true, and yet they genuinely appear angry nonetheless. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just the power of persuasion or ideas? I wonder if rank and file Nazi guards genuinely felt anger toward Jewish inmates? </p>

		<p>Still, even if 333 million is an accurate figure for 2050, it&rsquo;s still far too many and with 180 million European Americans that puts their share of the population at 54 percent, not that different from what Newsweek said in their 1987 article about the changing face of America.  The Census counts illegals, foreign students, green card holders, etc. regardless of citizenship status and the current population is about 309 million.  If you estimate 20 million (there&rsquo;s probably more) illegals then the actual population is 289 million.  If we can just enforce the border and send these people packing our 2050 population will be just barely over 300 million.  </p>

		<p>It was a mathematical inevitability that population growth in terms of percentage would eventually drop   &mdash;   The higher the population goes in raw numbers, the less that each new person contributes to the rate of growth.</p>
<p>If the United States keeps on its circa 25 million new people per decade pace, the population will be a tad over 400 million in 2050.  </p>
<p>The flaw in the analysis, as presented in this article, is that it seems to ignore the racial composition of who is coming and who is going, so to speak.  By 2050, a good portion of the white baby boomers will be gone, even the youngest ones will be 90, and while the population might not grow as quickly, it&rsquo;s still going to get more and more non-white.</p>

<p>This paragraph to a point, can be seen as a yodeling through the graveyard!</p>
<p>While I welcome the optimistic tone of the article, certain things do remain constant. A USA of 333 million people will still be only 60% white. Even subtracting what I consider to be a ridiculously low estimated contribution from illegal invaders at 12 million, and the percentages are still utterly unacceptable (61%) if the white population is really at 200 million by that point in history, and all the illegal invaders are really gone. </p>
<p>This country must, just to survive as we reasonably understand the USA as it should simply mirror its past, return to being 75% white. This requires a white population of 200 million, in a total population of at best 267 million, at the most low end of nonwhite &ldquo;contributions&rdquo; and &ldquo;enrichments&rdquo; in the reverse. Adjusting for a white population of truly 200 million, the total USA&rsquo;s population really should be 225, and whites making up 88.8% of the total as we did from 1900 to 1970 approximately. </p>
<p>Enough said and how do we do this?</p>
<p>I am open to suggestions,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>This is indeed good news for our people! </p>
<p>Immigration (legal and illegal) is NOT a force of nature. It is a function of official US policy.</p>
<p>Most of the efforts to stem the tide has been focused on illegal aliens - rightly so no doubt. However, unless we can stem the flow of LEGAL immigration as well, we are just as doomed.</p>
<p>AmRen highlighted an article yesterday stating that 748,000 foreigners were granted &#8216;permanent resident alien&rsquo; (aka green cards) status last year - with only 9% coming from Europe! That doesn&rsquo;t count the 100s of thousands of &#8216;temporary non-immigrant&rsquo; visas issued annually such as H1B, L1, F1 student visas, B1/B2 visitor visas etc. Of course, illegal aliens don&rsquo;t factor into that number either.</p>
<p>To finally turn the demographic tide in our favor, we must;</p>
<p>1) Interpret the 14th amendment properly. We are more likely to have success at the state level. For example; Arizona will soon begin issuing separate birth certificates to the children of US citizens (and &#8216;permanent resident aliens&rsquo;) and illegal aliens, foreign students, H1Bs, L1s, tourists, etc.</p>
<p>2) End &#8216;chain migration&rsquo; by allowing naturalized citizens to only sponsor members of their nuclear family - with adult children excluded. No uncles, aunts, grandmothers, cousins, etc need apply.</p>
<p>Of course, our ultimate goal is eliminating ALL non-white immigration completely! However, political realities dictate that we adopt a strategy that can succeed - especially at the state level.</p>
<p>Once the 2 suggestions above are implemented, the whole immigration inertia will have shifted - in our favor!</p>

		<p>Obviously, there is a physical limit to how many people can live in this country&hellip;.regardless of their standard of living. Even if this country is reduced to yet another Third World hellhole by unrestricted immigration, legal and otherwise, there are physical limits that we cannot expect to be exceeded. This is not Hong Kong nor is it Amsterdam. Many cities in Texas are already hard-pressed for water. Solid waste continues to be a challenge, even where there is plenty of open countryside. Food is distributed, almost totally, by truck&hellip;which requires a roadway. We&hellip;.and by We, I mean all of Western Civilization&hellip;.need to give some thought to how many people we can support in the lands where we now constitute the society and government. Let the rest of the world stew in their own juices, but keep this country separate and apart. Yes, it can be done.<br>

		<p>At the official CDC vital statistics site, I have noticed that the number of nonwhite births hit a peak of 2,005,900 in 2007 and have fallen to 1,919,059 according to preliminary 2009 statistics, a drop of about 4%. White births fell by 4% also due to the recession, but the shrinkage of nonwhite births is an important factor in slowing the loss of the country, because until 2007, they were constantly increasing.</p>

		<p>Well, this is certainly better news than the 400 million figure we heard before, but color me skeptical about this report. For one thing, isn&rsquo;t it possible that the census bureau might have played with the figures just a little at the behest of their masters? After all, what better to attack one of the best (non-racial, that is) immigration restrictionist arguments, that immigration will turn our country into an overcrowded hellhole, than to cook the books and say that the country won&rsquo;t really be that crowded after all. Also, what better way to distract a white majority that&rsquo;s finally taken notice of demographic trends that are reducing it to a minority in the next thirty years, than to say that the situation really isn&rsquo;t as bad as it seems, that whites could be 54% (a bare majority, but a majority nonetheless) rather than 46%? Call me paranoid, but I smell a rat.</p>

		<p>The single most important thing, race, is studiously avoided in this article.  Even explicitly!  Note the first line of the fifth paragraph.   </p>
<p>Even as the population grows, the actual number of white people is decreasing.  <br>
We are on the path to extinction.  <br>
&#8220;If we stay the course, we are dead! We are ALL dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>A nation of our own, for our own- that is for white people only -  is critical to our survival.  Any nation to which the rest of the world is welcome will be non-white.  Nothing will save us if we won&rsquo;t save ourselves.  </p>

		<p>You have to realize that the US census does not count the number of whites in the USA. It counts the number of caucasians of which whites are merely a subgroup (whites are their own distinct group if you group people by mental profile instead of by superficial looks). See <a href="/ar/2002/01/index.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2002/01/index.html</a> for details. Ok? Do we all understand that caucasian isnt necessarily the same as white yet the census uses the terms interchangeably? Ok then, next step:</p>
<p>Birth numbers: <a href="https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704312104575298512006681060.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLTopStories" rel="nofollow">https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704312104575298512006681060.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLTopStories</a></p>
<p>About half of the births in the USA are noncaucasian. These amount for 35% of the population. A reasonable estimation is that 3 out of 4 caucasians in the USA are whites and not north africans, turks, persians, gypsies, high yella mestisos and so on. If we presume that birth rates are identical across all caucasian groups then whites should account for 75% of half the births in the USA or about 38%. That means that whites will be about 38% of the indigenous born 40 year olds in 2050. Add immigration to that, compensate for the white inverse population pyramid and you are going to slip below 30%. A logical conclusion is therefore that the future USA will be nation with a young and middle aged non white majority and a bunch of old whiteys. Any caucasian immgration is likely to be almost exclusively non white and not white in nature - which means tons of north africans and middle easterners because thats where the population growth is. </p>

		<p>For years, the liberal media has been trumpeting that whites are doomed to minority status and that everyone should just accept the inevitable and learn to like it.  The resulting doomsday attitude of some whites is exactly what the far left wants, so why should any of us just sigh in defeat and accept it?  Our primary problem is illegal immigration.  Other countries control this, and so can the U.S.  Even legal immigration is subject to legislative control and can be implemented at any time.  Blacks make up a mere 12-13%, a figure that has shifted very little in decades.  Disease, drug use, murder, and abortion keep their numbers at this percentile.  <br>
What we need are legislators that have a pro-white agenda!</p>

		<p>Interesting&hellip;&hellip; but there are many variables; there are many unforeseen variables. In the 1830s Ireland was more densely populated than China. Epidemic disease and malnutrition were rare; infant mortality was low and life spans were long. The sudden introduction of a potato blight from Mexico changed everything. I guess you can all connect the dots.</p>

<p>B) A new disease could come out of Africa which makes AIDS look like a head cold; Suppose it was ethno-specific and airborne?</p>
<p>C) Millions of Whites in Europe, Africa or Australia may have to abandon their homes for North America because of ethnic cleansing, economic necessity or natural calamity.</p>
<p>D) Millions of Blacks and Browns might leave North America for greener pastures. Yes, that sounds rather improbable, but who really knows?</p>

		<p>I must disagree with an earlier poster. Chain migration does not need to be ended; Non-white migration needs to be ended. There is no harm in allowing the relatives of fellow whites to come.</p>

		<p>This article is good news in a way but if the White population is at barely the majority with 333 million, then that&rsquo;s Brazil not America.  Does anyone remember the 1980s, the last best decade this country has seen?  A population of 250 million people and averaging 78 percent White for that ten year span of time?  When the cities were still inhabitable and the minorities which were largely blacks lived on the other side of the tracks in their own neighborhoods?  When seeing Mexicans in the Deep South was an oddity?  What we need to do is decrease the nonwhite population in this country by cancelling the millions of nonwhite fecund green card holders living in this country and order them deported.</p>

		<p>Population growth is slowing down EVERYWHERE! Western countries simply started the trend that will slowly take over the planet. It is very slow process but it will happen after long decades of fast growth. Mexico already is showing slow growth. It may sound surprising but number of births per woman in Mexico is close to that of US.</p>

		<p>Gotta love all these predictions of various types that try to describe what the US will be like at some unknowable time, decades from now.</p>
<p>What all these predictions are purposefully ignoring is the fact that non-whites, as a group are non-productive&hellip;.and completely reliant on whites for their day to day existence.  There is no evidence whatsoever that non-whites could feed themselves, beyond tiny pockets of exceptional people, were the white system of civilization, mass production, and distribution, to break.</p>
<p>But here is the important part.  The world economy is terrible&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..why?  There are alot of theories but let me tell you a few observable facts.  Whites are not re-producing.  Instead, whites are doubling, tripling up and more on our productivity.  Two income relationships are the norm now.  Many of those who actually have children, need to work what amounts to two jobs for each parent, to support them.  Why?  Because all that extra productivity is needed to support non-whites.  And increasingly, non-whites are taking more than just the basics of living.  It&rsquo;s not enough to have their needs taken care of.  They demand a first world existence where they do drugs all day long and destroy civilization for others using violence.</p>
<p>The result is there for all to see.  The mass production system of whites is floundering and is threatening to collapse. What this means in real terms is whites have reached the limit of our ability to support non-whites.  As our population shrinks, our capacity to provide for them shrinks.</p>
<p>To be blunt, new, non-whites added to the system are going to starve to death.  Many non-whites already in the system are going to starve to death.  If more is taken from whites to try and mitigate this, it will only accelerate the process.</p>
<p>The most likely prediction I think is that there will be war (like we already don&rsquo;t have that) followed by fiscal collapse of the government.  Our mass production system is waaay too powerful at this point, to stop, short of nuclear war, but the means by which distribution to those outside productive whites, is very close to collapse.  The shocking thing will be the extent to which productive whites don&rsquo;t notice anything different.  It will be, ho hum, the stupid fed went bankrupt and now I pay my taxes to the state&hellip;.but life really hasn&rsquo;t changed in the last decade.</p>
<p>But among non-whites, it will be a catastrophe.  Stripped of welfare, they will mass migrate away from the US.  There won&rsquo;t be any welfare dollars in their accounts and no grocery store to buy them in (already well developed in places like detroit).  At first, they will squat in the places the government used to pay their rent for.  But then they will try to move where the food is.  There will be isolated cases of white charities taking care of them but mostly, no way to link them into the system.  They will quickly wear out their welcome wherever they go.</p>
<p>There will be violence, of course, but not as much as you think.  Starving retards (and make no mistake, these people have the IQ of retards) who hate each other, with no resources, gasoline, vehicles etc. are hardly a threat to communities of well fed, armed, white communities who suffer a few direct attacks by them.  With no federal government to punish those who fight back&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>In short, MY prediction for what demographics will be like decades from now, is very different.  It&rsquo;s based on a simple observation.  Non-whites are completely and totally dependent on whites&hellip;&hellip;.and their are limits to what whites can provide.</p>
<p>Whites, as a group, really don&rsquo;t understand this.  But the more time passes, the more obvious it will become.  You will know we&rsquo;ve reached a turning point when the dominant attitude becomes how harmful it is for whites to bring non-whites into a system that isn&rsquo;t self-sustainable.  It&rsquo;s cruel and leads to massive death and suffering.</p>
<p>Which is all true, of course.  Most whites allow themselves to not see the consequences.  That can&rsquo;t continue forever.</p>

		<p>Lest my post be misunderstood, I would like follow up;</p>
<p>My first post boils down to the old argument; can we work within the system or must we work outside of it (within limits of the law to be sure) to secure our homeland.</p>
<p>In an ideal situation, persons of exclusive European DNA would be allowed to immigrate to our lands and bring along their extended families. However, political realities being what they are, it is not possible at this time to restrict immigration to persons of exclusive European DNA.</p>
<p>OTOH, considering the vast gulf separating white and non white voters, as recently highlighted by AmRen; it is within political possibilities that immigration could be restricted to &#8216;nuclear families&rsquo; - father, mother, dependent children (excluding adult children).</p>
<p>We are also on the cusp of achieving a proper interpretation of the 14th amendment whereby birthright citizenship would be conferred only upon those with at least one US citizen parent (or &#8216;permanent resident alien&rsquo;). As already noted, this would exclude illegal aliens, H1Bs, L1s, F1 student visas, B1/B2 visitor visas, etc.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, as well as shut down ANY talk of amnesty for illegal aliens, it is essential that we not be perceived as  &#8216;racist&rsquo; by the white masses! Hence, when they shout &#8216;anti-immigrant&rsquo;, we respond; no, we are pro-immigrant but want new immigrants to assimilate, thats why we think only &#8216;nuclear families&rsquo; should be allowed to come into our country. When they shout &#8216;racist&rsquo; for wanting to secure our border and interpret the 14th amendment properly, we respond; no, we simply believe in the rule of law.</p>
<p>Here is the key; we ONLY need to convince a super majority of WHITES of the wisdom of our goals to have them enacted into law! Remember that whites are still 77% of the US electorate!</p>

		<p>&#8220;no, we are pro-immigrant but want new immigrants to assimilate, thats why we think only &lsquo;nuclear families&rsquo; should be allowed to come into our country.&#8221;<br>
But that&rsquo;s not true. I don&rsquo;t want indefinite immigration and &#8220;assimilation&#8221; of nonwhite immigrants, and I don&rsquo;t think anyone else here does either. And while people on the left can lie effortlessly and guiltlessly, most on the right are terrible liars, even when the audience is inclined to believe them.<br>
And besides, bringing in only the nuclear families of immigrants wouldn&rsquo;t be much better. They still get to bring their kids over here to live on our dime, get racial preferences over whites in public (and most private) colleges, vote, and breed.</p>
<p>Either we can get a majority of the country to support a moratorium on immigration now, when real unemployment is well above 10 percent, or we can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s really that simple. Of course, we should also be talking about ceding territory that&rsquo;s already majority nonwhite (in exchange for ending their representation in our government, of course). Getting rid of Hawaii (3/4 nonwhite), California (at least the southern portion), South Texas, and New Mexico, and enforcing the new border vigorously, could do a great deal to at least slow the process of browning. Make Hawaii independent (while keeping our base at Pearl Harbor, kind of like our base at Guantanamo), and give the other places back to Mexico. While they&rsquo;re rapidly turning into the worst parts of our country, they&rsquo;d probably be the crown jewel of Mexico, at least until the Mexicans ran it their way for awhile.</p>

<p>I wish I could agree, but how do we factor in the MILLIONS of their citizens who have come over here during that same time frame and had 3-4 babies each?<br>
