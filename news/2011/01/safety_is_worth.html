			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Veronica Rocha, Glendale News Press, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Broadway and Glendale Avenue got a new, safe &#8220;look&#8221; on Thursday.</p>
<p>As part of an ongoing public safety campaign, public works crews painted over a large stencil with the word &#8220;Look,&#8221; which was placed at the foot of the crosswalk as a warning to pedestrians to look for oncoming traffic before crossing.</p>
<p>The message in English, Armenian and Spanish will be placed at several intersections with high foot traffic as part of the city&rsquo;s &#8220;Driven 2 Distraction&#8221; public education campaign aimed to curb distracted driving and encourage pedestrian safety, officials said.</p>
<p>Along with the word &#8220;Look,&#8221; the stencil includes an arrow pointing pedestrians to the intended direction of travel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To combat an increasing number of pedestrian-involved traffic collisions, Zurn said the city bought the customized sentence to get the word out about traffic safety to residents. Similar street signs have been used in England and Ireland, he added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Police Department launched the public education campaign in November when it staged two badly wrecked vehicles on Glenoaks Boulevard and Verdugo Road with the messages &#8220;Slow down&#8221; and &#8220;Texting kills.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campaign  &mdash;  funded through a $254,795 grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety  &mdash;  was also focused on city engineering, public education and targeted law enforcement operations.</p>

		<p>The efforts of leftists to discourage assimilation by immigrants endangers them and others. Apparently advocates of diversification don&rsquo;t mind immigrants getting hurt or hurting others. Rather they are more than willing to pay that price in human suffering to dismantle Western culture. </p>

		<p>No wonder California is going broke paying a quarter million for this multilingual nonsense. I can see the day coming where LA would have to paint this notice in so many languages at a cross walk, it would go half way across the street to cover most of them.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a publik school crossing zone death of an elementary school student about 12 years ago in Winston-Salem, NC. The driver of the car that ignored/disobeyed a crossing guard&rsquo;s directives (given by hand signals and an octagonal hand held red sign bearing a simple large font &#8220;STOP&#8221; text was a Costa Rican national with a Costa Rican university edukashun. She beat her vehicular negligent homocide charge in court with a claim of English illiteracy. This notwithstanding the fact that stop signs in Costa Rica (and the rest of Latin America) are graphically identical to those here in the US except for the text which is &#8220;ALTO&#8221; in most places or an occasional &#8220;PARE&#8221;.</p>
<p>In NC we now have school crossing guard hand held stop signs bearing the text &#8220;STOPALTO&#8221;. I wonder if I could smush a second grader flatter than a tortilla and tell the judge that I had no idea what &#8220;STOPALTO&#8221; meant.</p>

		<p>Bilingual traffic signs and other bilingual things in American society are a disgrace to the memory of earlier iimmigrants who came to our country, like those who came through Ellis Island.</p>
<p>My own ancestors came to America in the early 20th Century from Russia, just like in &#8220;Fiddler on the Roof.&#8221;  They did not demand that American society have Russian written and spoken everywhere, but learned to speak English and became Americans.</p>
<p>For legal immigrants, I have this to say: learn to speak English and become an American!</p>
<p>Hurrah for Joey Vento, in South Philly, for demanding that his customers speak English, when buying his cheese steaks!</p>

		<p>As a Canadian this whole language issue in America really worries me. This is how it all starts. Its just a &#8220;safety issue&#8221;. No hidden agenda here. By the time Americans wake up it will be too late.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of what happened at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo CA a few years back. A man lost his hat on the rollercoaster, so he decided to jump the fence to retrive it. There was a large warning sign on the fence warning people to keep out, but he no habla english. He was struck and killed by the coaster, actually is was some ladies leg as the ride came down. Her leg was severally broken. This poor immigrant&rsquo;s family sued Six Flags and won an undiscolsed amount of money because he could not read the sign. Now the signs are in English and Spanish. I&rsquo;m still waiting for this to happen to a Chinese immigrant so the sign can be in three languages, then four, then five&hellip;then 10 languages.</p>

		<p>Good Lord! Armenians, start acting like white men and women, grow a set, and assimilate like pretty much every other whitey has done! The Asians are assimiliating better than you. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t shape up, you&rsquo;ll be lumped in the same boat as the brown Mexican illegals - and you&rsquo;ll belong there.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the rest of the world have traffic signs that are just pictures, no reading necessary?</p>
<p>That being said, I agree  &mdash;  you want to come here, do so legally, and learn English.</p>

		<p>Now that I am retired I go to my local senior citizens center about 3 times a week.  About 80 percent of the seniors there are Persians.  The majority of them do not speak a word of English although they came to this country around the time the Shah was overthrown 30 years ago.</p>
<p>This drive to educate pedestrians about traffic safety is all over California.  It is due to the massive number of immigrant drivers who have no license and do not know how to drive.  Many immigrants who do have licenses paid someone to take the written and driving tests.  So there are massive numbers of pedestrians being run down.  </p>
<p>It is kind of a blame the pedestrian victim thing.  Of course the massive traffic jams caused by letting a million immigrants per year into California is the real cause of traffic accidents.  We just can&rsquo;t keep up with the school, housing, hospital and street and freeway building to accommodate the entire population of the earth that seems intent on moving to California.</p>

		<p>Between the fact that road building cannot keep up with immigration and the millions of immigrants cannot drive well California is increasingly dangerous for pedestrians.</p>
<p>In my city the police have put up signs at some of the intersections telling pedestrians to look first and be careful.  That&rsquo;s all very well, but what to do when some immigrant ignores the go pedestrian don&rsquo;t go left turn auto signals and hits a pedestrian. Or smashes through a yellow or red light and hits a car and a couple pedestrians?</p>
<p>I am now disabled for the rest of my life due to a car vs pedestrian accident.  It was not a busy business district intersection.  It was a single family home residential district on a Sunday evening. The car was the only one for several blocks.  A Guatmalean Indian ran through a red light and smashed my entire left side from shoulder to ankle.</p>
<p>Traffic is bad, but it is the immigrants with no licenses, fake licenses etc who are the cause of the rise in pedestrian accidents in California and all over the country.</p>
