<h1>Anger Rises Over Proposed Mpls. Dog Park</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Randy Furst, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), January 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At a highly volatile meeting punctuated by angry allegations, a series of speakers, most of them black, blasted the Minneapolis Park Board for continuing to consider a proposal to put a dog park on the site of the Martin Luther King Park in south Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The animosity overflowed when the board rejected efforts to remove King Park as an option for the dog park. Some in the audience rose and started to sing &#8220;We Shall Overcome,&#8221; the anthem of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.</p>
<p>Board Chair John Erwin promised the board would make a decision in February, but that did not pacify many in the crowd, who said putting a dog park in King Park would desecrate the memory of the slain civil rights leader.</p>
<p>Spike Moss, a long-time black civil rights activist, called a dog park at King Park &#8220;ridiculous,&#8221; citing the &#8220;savage dogs&#8221; that were once used to attack civil rights protesters. {snip}</p>
<p>He predicted that if a dog park was put in the King Park, young people would shoot the animals.</p>
<p>The dispute has continued to escalate over the past six months. Wednesday&rsquo;s meeting appeared to pit the black audience members against the Park Board members in attendance, all of whom were white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Desecrate?&#8221;  Has MLK attained full god-status, then?  Will heretics and blasphemers against His cult be tried for heresy?</p>
<p>It seems that full-blown worship  &mdash;  not just of the Great Black Saint, but of <i>all</i> things black  &mdash;  is now the expected order of the day.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;He predicted that if a dog park was put in the King Park, young people would shoot the animals.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>For &#8220;predicted,&#8221; read &#8220;suggested.&#8221;  And given the well-known savagery of blacks toward animals, those &#8220;young people&#8221; would need very little urging.<br>

		<p>I lived in and around Minneapolis for 25 years, so I am familiar with that park. It became a favorite business location for drug dealers and prostitutes in the 1980&rsquo;s and my Minnesota contacts have verified that it remains so to this day. That being the case, it is clear that the park is a remarkably fitting tribute to Mike King, the best national figurehead that Blacks could come up with. </p>
<p>Blacks are well within their rights to want to preserve this park in it&rsquo;s present form. To them, the park is more than just a place where basketball games often end in violence, and it is more than just trampled grass and trees decorated with used condoms: It is a vibrant microcosm of the Black nation within our nation.</p>

<p>Is this an off the wall prediction or is it a threat? If they do open the dog park, maybe they can invite Michael Vick and his friends.</p>
<p>Face it. MLK JR is America&rsquo;s saint and dogs shall not desecrate the sacred ground that caries His name.</p>

		<p>This might be a minor incident, but for me, it&rsquo;s the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.  Because dogs were used against blacks at civil rights protests 50 years ago, there can&rsquo;t be a dog park now?  Blacks can&rsquo;t see the difference between police dogs 50 years ago and cuddly pets frolicking around a dog park?  Blacks can&rsquo;t be gracious for the benefit of some people who probably weren&rsquo;t even alive during those protests, but just want a nice place to bring their dogs now?  Do blacks EVER think of anyone but themselves?  </p>
<p>And even if the dog park gets approved, (which it won&rsquo;t; blacks ALWAYS get their way,) what dog owner is going to bring their pet there NOW, now that blacks have &#8220;predicted&#8221; (threatened) that the dogs will be shot?!  Once again, blacks acting like two-year-olds, demanding their own way or else.</p>
<p>Well, chalk up one more thing ruined by blacks.  Chalk up one more incident where racist blacks dictate to whites what they can and cannot do.  Honestly, people, how much more of this ARE we going to take?</p>

<p>MLK&rsquo;s image is making inroads into Canadian culture, even though most of the black immigrants there originated directly from Africa or the Caribbean.</p>

<p>Considering the multitude of blacks who own pit bulls, often considered the most &#8216;savage dogs&rsquo;, I find this canine objection  typically perplexing about blacks.</p>

<p>Good point Shawn. The pit bull breed, and others like the Rottweiler, owned by Bantus suffer, BECAUSE they are owned by Bantus who don&rsquo;t take the time to properly train and handle their dogs.</p>
<p>Shawn, another thing is that some Bantus actually consider the German shepherd breed to be &#8220;racists&#8221;, because they were used by police officers in the South and elsewhere. Do you believe it? How can an animal be &#8220;racist&#8221;, when it has no cognizance of the term?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised Bantus don&rsquo;t consider the tse-tse fly to be a racist insect, because of the number of people killed by disease, on the mother continent. </p>

		<p>You guys do not understand the symbolism. Dog parks are used by white middle class yuppies. Blacks let their dogs run wild. If you build a dog park, yuppies move in. Property values go up and more yuppies move in, forcing the blacks out. Then the street will be renamed Bill Gates drive&hellip; You can understand why blacks are upset by this.</p>

		<p>All it takes is for one black to complain about something, and then all blacks will either back him or remain silent.  The liberal MSM will jump on the issue and, no matter how specious, will take the blacks&rsquo; side or at least call the matter controversial and worthy of discussion.  <br>
From the comments about this park, I would judge that few whites go there now and would not, even with a dozen pit bulls on leashes to protect them.</p>

		<p>No need to find it &#8220;perplexing&#8221;, friend Shawn (the female). It&rsquo;s the well-known mentality (or better yet, it&rsquo;s lack of mental abilities) Blacks are too often well-known for.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t the only park news from Minneapolis involving blacks. In December, three black teenagers sexually assaulted, at gunpoint, a woman crosscountry skiing with her two children in Powderhorn Park in Minneapolis. Powderhorn is also pretty much ghetto but there are also quite a few kooky white leftists in the area. Needless to say, none of these well-known black activists had anything to say about black violence in Powderhorn. For that matter, neither did the white kooks. Their response to the assault was to hold a celebration at a community center three days later to bring the community together through art and puppet shows. When I first heard the story I thought &#8216;who would be out in Powderhorn after dark&rsquo;? People who would fight crime with puppet shows, that&rsquo;s who.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that such calls are futile, it&rsquo;s crazy to demand that whites-especially the kind of whites who would go to a crime-ridden park named after MLK-produce more children who are likely to become the brainwashed subjects of a genocidally anti-white Cultural Marxist system. All you&rsquo;re doing is giving a destructive regime a longer lease on life by providing more productive slaves.</p>

		<p>This is a true story. I had a German Shepard-Rottweiler mix whn I lived in that lovely black-run city, Birmingham, Ala.  He was basically a sweet dog, but did look a little bit gruesome. Anyway, I was walking him one day, which frightened a black mailman nearby so badly, he wouldn&rsquo;t get out of his truck! Of course some highly discontented obese middle age black woman (almost a universal type <br>
I think) had to start yelling, &#8220;Dogs should&rsquo;nt be allowed!&#8221;  I just looked at her and said, &#8220;If you people wouldn&rsquo;t commit so much   &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   crime, we wouldn&rsquo;t have dogs. But oh so typical of the black mentality-they only think about themselves.</p>

		<p>To answer Proud Forever; </p>
<p>The twin cities area of Minnesota is an epicenter of white guilt gone bad.  Cities not to far gone in America, should take notice not to do what they are doing.  Although I enjoy Garrison Keillor as a humorist and in many ways his Minnesotan based stories are a homage to white culture, however if you read his opinion pieces you will soon discovery where they have gone awry.  They seem immune from race reality and suffer from typical white do-gooder/guilt syndrome,.  They have gone out of there way to accept so called Somali refugees and seemly try to out do other states in welfare benefits.  Put out a bright light the moths will come. </p>

		<p>By the same token, black people still bear psychic wounds from the firehoses that were turned on them by Sherrif Clark.  So no firehoses should be allowed on any Martin Luther King Boulevard anywhere.  And if, as a result, some buildings burn down because the fire department can&rsquo;t put out the flames, well that&rsquo;s just too bad.</p>
<p>The dog park should be put at the Michael Vick Municipal Park, which I&rsquo;m sure will be opened any day.</p>
