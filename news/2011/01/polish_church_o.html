<h1><a href="https://www.thenews.pl/national/artykul148059_polish-church-observes-islam-day.html">Polish Church Observes &#8216;Islam Day&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Polskie Radio (Warsaw), January 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Poland&rsquo;s Roman Catholic Church is observing Islam Day, which closes the week of &#8216;Prayer for Christian Unity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The main ceremonies are being held in St. Florian&rsquo;s church in Warsaw and will gather Catholics and Muslims today at a meeting devoted to ways of overcoming violence between various religious denominations.</p>
<p>Among the participants are the head of the Polish Episcopate&rsquo;s Interreligious Council, members of the Joint Catholics and Muslims Council as well as spiritual leaders of the Muslim community in Poland.</p>
<p>The Islam Day is celebrated in Poland for the 11th time. Polish Moslems include descendants of the Tartars, who have lived here for 600 years, as well as more recent arrivals  &mdash;  Turks, Arabs and Bosnians.<br>

		<p>At first glance it certainly sounds disturbing, but we should also remember that the Muslim population in Polish is, in absolute and proportional terms, significantly smaller than is in the West. And most Poles don&rsquo;t want Islam in their land. They see Poland as a Slavic, European, Catholic nation - and so it should be!</p>
<p>Even the Catholic Church in Poland generally takes a skeptical look with regards to Islam. This might be just a bump rather than the indication of a growing tumor.</p>

		<p>Who would have thought such a thing possible&hellip;in Poland?  In 1683 the Polish monarch, John III of the House of Sobieski, led an army that repelled the Turkish Muslims laying siege to Vienna.  If victorious, the Ottoman might well have conquered all of Europe.  </p>
<p>Now, weak-kneed Polish prelates fete the Muslims.  Don&rsquo;t think for a second that the Muslims will reciprocate.  </p>

		<p>The Poles have made a pact with the devil. The EU. NOW even a nation such as Poland must accept a portion of migrants, illegals, asylum seekers, etc.</p>
<p>Poland at the end of WW2 was one of the most, perhaps the most, homogeneous nation on the planet. And better for it too. Too much discord in the history of Poland has because of warring factions, larger and more powerful surrounding nations claiming a piece of Poland, etc.</p>
<p>Poland is going back to where it was many hundreds of years ago? And for the worse too?</p>
<p>Poland was the one nation too that should be recognized as a defender of Christianity. When Poland was a super-power, the cavalry of the Poles, the Winged Hussars, were noted for their 1,000 kilometer [600 mile] sweeps, looking to &#8220;cut-sign&#8221;, determine the whereabouts of the Islamic slavers! Slavers, the Turks, the Crimean Tartars, bad guys all of them, wishing to enslave the Slavic whites and sell them in the markets of Istanbul to the Grand Turk.</p>
<p>NOW the Poles greet the Muslim? Hoping to find common ground are you now? Good luck!</p>
<p>Go ask the &#8220;Turk&#8221; or the &#8220;Tartar&#8221; just to say &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry&#8221; one time. That is all! Go ahead.</p>

		<p>Remember one of the fables from the Arabian Nights, about the &#8216;Arab and the Camel&rsquo;? Only this time it is the Arab on the edge of the Polish tent. Be careful, very very careful.</p>

		<p>This isnt particulary odd. Christians all over Europe do this because they feel more kinship with worshippers of other semitic religions than they feel with their own countrymen. </p>

		<p>All of this dialogue and ecumaniacism started after the false Vatican II Council with the antipopes John Paul II and Ratzinger obsessed with apologizing and dialoguing  with infidels and pagans instead of trying to convert them. It is part of the suicide of Europe. It is symptomatic of the loss of faith in Christianity and in western civilization by these false leaders. Our children will curse us.</p>

		<p>Not all Muslims in Poland are recent immigrants.</p>
<p>The Lipka Tartars have been in Poland and Lithuania for centuries.  In 1683, they comprised part of the Polish force which rode to the relief of Vienna.</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with Christendom showing gratitude to this particular group of Muslims - they deserve it.</p>

<p>NO! they do not! One muslim in a civilized country is one to many and will mean the eventual downfall of any society in which they are allowed to increase their numbers. Like I said, one muslim can be polite, two muslims will want a mosque, 3 muslims will DEMAND a mosque, 4 muslims will demand YOU build their mosque, 5 muslims will DEMAND you PAY for their mosque, 6 muslims start murdering and blowing things up! We non muslims have 1400 years of proof of the above and STILL we are mostly in denial of those facts!</p>
