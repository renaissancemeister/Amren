<h1><a href="https://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2011/01/dhs_has_not_determined_possibl.html">Official: DHS Has <em>Not</em> Determined Any Possible Ties Between Arizona Shooter and Right Wing Group</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Sargent, Washington Post, January 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the last 24 hours, the Web has been alive with speculation that the Arizona shooter has some sort of ties to a right-wing group called American Renaissance. The primary source for this claim is a Fox News report from yesterday saying that law enforcement had made this determination based on information provided by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>But a DHS official tells me that the department has not established any such possibility, undercutting what appears to be the primary basis for this claim.</p>
<p>Fox News&rsquo;s report yesterday initially claimed that a DHS memo had outlined the possible connection, and defined American Renaissance as a &#8220;pro-white racist organization&#8221; that Jared Loughner &#8220;mentioned in some of his internet postings.&#8221; Fox later walked back the report a bit, sourcing the claim to &#8220;a law enforcement memo based on information provided by DHS.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Fox report caused a splash, with some news orgs reporting that anonymous officials had confirmed such possible ties. Some conservatives railed at DHS for supposedly trying to tie the shooter to the right for political reasons, and others disputed the suggestion that this displayed the shooter&rsquo;s ideological leanings.</p>
<p>But DHS has not officially provided any such information to any law enforcement officials, the DHS official says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not established any such possible link,&#8221; the official says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The official adds that it wouldn&rsquo;t be DHS&rsquo;s place to reach any such conclusion in the first place, since the FBI is leading the investigation.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Patrik Jonsson, Christian Science Monitor, January 9, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A possible link between Jared Lee Loughner, the primary suspect in the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, and American Renaissance, the publication of an anti-immigration group, offers potential new insights into what may have caused the 22-year-old Arizonan to carry out the attack, which killed six people and wounded more than a dozen outside a Tucson, Ariz. stripmall on Saturday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Sunday, Fox News quoted a Department of Homeland Security memo that states Mr. Loughner is &#8220;possibly linked&#8221; to American Renaissance, which DHS says promotes views that are &#8220;anti-government, anti-immigration, anti-ZOG [Zionist Occupational Government], anti-Semitic.&#8221; Both Giffords and Mr. Zimmerman are Jewish.</p>
<p>American Renaissance is the publication of the The New Century Foundation, described by the Anti-Defamation League as a &#8220;self-styled think tank.&#8221; The ADL, on its website, calls American Renaissance a &#8220;white supremacist journal and companion Website&#8221; that &#8220;promotes pseudoscientific studies that attempt to demonstrate the intellectual and cultural superiority of whites and publishes articles on the supposed decline of American society because of integrationist social policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DHS memo quoted on Fox goes on to say: &#8220;Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the target of Loughner&rsquo;s firing frenzy, is the first Jewish female elected to such a high position in the US government. She was also opposite this group&rsquo;s ideology when it came to immigration debate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at Loughner&rsquo;s web posts, he puts himself out as half fantasy seeker and dreamer and half political philosopher, and American Renaissance, while a hate group, markets itself as a political philosophy organization,&#8221; says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, at San Bernardino.</p>
<p>Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research at the Anti-Defamation League, is skeptical about any hard connection between Loughner and American Renaissance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fans of American Renaissance tend to be older and they tend to be intellectuals or pseudo-intellectuals,&#8221; says Mr. Pitcavage. &#8220;Based on the limited nature of [Loughner&rsquo;s] internet footprint suggesting his thoughts and beliefs, there&rsquo;s nothing to lead one to think he would lean that way. It&rsquo;s perplexing to us that there is a notion of a substantial connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>American Renaissance&rsquo;s website carries what appears to be a paid tea party advertisement featuring the &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Tread on Me&#8221; flag that&rsquo;s become synonymous with many of the movement&rsquo;s protests.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The New Century Foundation was founded by Yale University graduate Jared Taylor, the author of several books on race and policy who has has written that diversity is &#8220;dangerous&#8221; because it is &#8220;one of the most divisive forces on the planet.&#8221; </p>
<p>Mr. Taylor has become a well-known and oftentimes mainstream commentator on race and immigration issues, having appeared on networks like CNN as well as hard-right radio shows. The ADL describes his bailiwick as &#8220;intellectualized white supremacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Invited by a college conservative group to speak at Clemson in 2007, Taylor said, &#8220;It is a mistake to assume it is wrong to prefer the company of people similar to oneself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is universal, and I think there&rsquo;s every reason to believe there are innate biological reasons.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In [the] United States, this kind of preference .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is recognized and encouraged and institutionalized so long as the people who are expressing this preference are not white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fox News quoted Taylor Sunday as calling the DHS&rsquo; views &#8220;scurrilous.&#8221; He took especial issue with the reference to his group being &#8220;anti-ZOG.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is complete nonsense,&#8221; he told Fox. &#8220;I have absolutely no idea what DHS is talking about. We have never used the term &#8216;ZOG.&rsquo; We have never thought in those terms. If this is the level of research we are getting from DHS, then Heaven help us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor said he checked his organization&rsquo;s records going back twenty years and Loughner never subscribed to American Renaissance&rsquo;s publications.</p>
<p>Through web posts and interviews with those who know him, a picture of Loughner has emerged as an anti-social, erratic and possibly mentally unstable young man, whose anti-religion and anti-flag views run starkly counter to the broader tea party platform. Caitie Parker, one of his high school classmates, says in press reports that in the past Loughner was &#8220;quite liberal,&#8221; and a &#8220;political radical.&#8221; Sheriff Dupnik said Saturday, &#8220;He has a troubled past, I can tell you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among favorite books listed on Loughner&rsquo;s MySpace page are &#8220;Brave New World&#8221; by Aldous Huxley and Hitler&rsquo;s &#8220;Mein Kampf.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his internet posts, Loughner complains that the government was in some way trying to take advantage of him. &#8220;I know who&rsquo;s listening: Government officials, and the People,&#8221; Loughner wrote. &#8220;Nearly all the people, who don&rsquo;t know this accurate information of a new currency, aren&rsquo;t aware of mind control and brainwash methods. If I have my civil rights, then this message wouldn&rsquo;t have happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some commentators minimized the likelihood Loughner was politically motivated.</p>
<p>&#8220;For all the instant analysis that this might be tied to political attacks on Giffords and others who supported President Obama on health-care reform, there&rsquo;s not a whiff of politics in Loughner&rsquo;s language about coins and calendars and other ramblings,&#8221; writes USA Today&rsquo;s Cathy Lynn Grossman. &#8220;Yet he does exclaim in his YouTube video, &#8216;No! I won&rsquo;t trust in God!&rsquo;&#148;</p>
<p>Trying to tease out definitive links between Loughner and specific political movements or groups is problematic, says Mr. Levin, of California State University.</p>
<p>&#8220;Extremists can be like bullets ricocheting off the political spectrum and bouncing to whatever gives them comfort or meshes with their paranoid distrust,&#8221; he says.<br>

		<p>American Renaissance must insist on a public apology by Fox News, for its defamation of the publication. The good name of AR has taken 20 years to build, and must be protected. Mr. Jared Taylor has gone to extraordinary lengths to distance himself from anti-semitic views, which has caused him to be attacked by some individuals on the extreme right. I recommend that AR sends a strongly-worded lawyer&rsquo;s letter to Fox News, that demands a public apology. The Fox News channel has shamed and disgraced itself, with its outrageous smear of AR.</p>

		<p>I first read about the possible link to Amren this morning from a link someone sent to me from London&rsquo;s Daily Mail. While reading it I shook my head in utter disbelief as they went on to label Amren as anti-semitic, anti-government, violent, etc&hellip; I was pleased, however, to see several people in the comments section call the Daily Mail out. </p>
<p><br>
It was very obvious the Daily Mail was trying to link this horrible incident to the BNP. I guess the truth was too much for them so they edited out a lot of it. (Although some of it was still there the last time I looked at that rag).</p>
<p><br>
I have been subscribing to Amren for several years and have NEVER witnessed anything we have been accused of. </p>

A donation will be coming shortly.</p>

		<p>This is a lesson for us all.  Political conservatives are not &#8220;race realists&#8221; notwithstanding the daily coverage of events from a racial perspective by the dominant media culture.</p>
<p>Political conservatives recoil from any suggestion that by thought or deed they support in any way the diverse white American peoples.</p>
<p>Political conservatives have drunk the anti-white kool-aid and are vehemently opposed to white interests on every level. </p>

		<p>They sure were fast to try to exploit this tragedy to further their political agenda. That&rsquo;s really stooping low, using murdered people as mere props for their own advantage. Shameless, that&rsquo;s what it is, and shows the gutter level cynicism of those who sprang into action to manipulate public perceptions of this event. </p>

		<p>The US just took a major leap toward the situation in Britain where telling the truth about race will get you arrested and jailed for decades.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t sue for millions of dollars today, you will likely end up in prison tomorrow for &#8220;hate speech&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s rather obvious that the killer has schizophrenia which makes him delusional, paranoid, and unable to think straight. He doesn&rsquo;t have any ideology, and isn&rsquo;t capable of having any ideology, because his brain can&rsquo;t function consistently. Random topics such as grammar and government get mixed up in his brain. There&rsquo;s no point trying to find any meaning in his views, because they are just random malfunctions in the way his neurons are connected. If you don&rsquo;t want this sort of thing to happen again, then keep unstable mentally ill people in institutions and force them to take their medications.</p>

		<p>A couple of new things we found out about the suspect:</p>
<p>1.  He wanted the new American national currency to be marijuana</p>
<p>2.  He built an occultist altar in his back yard.</p>
<p>As for Fox News, if they made up this memo, as someone here at AR said, they might have engaged in this bit of yellow journalism to circle the wagons around Palin and the TPM (and of course, they no more had links to the suspect than AR did).  As if to say, &#8220;not us conservatives, it&rsquo;s those *extreme* right wingers.  Of course, the slap happy dullards who made this decision, if it&rsquo;s the case, might have done better to pick out a website on the right whose &#8220;links&#8221; to violence is believable, even if not true.</p>

		<p>Fox slandered AmRen, not only did they present a &#8220;DHS&#8221; memo of questionable origin as fact but in the memo it states many falsehoods. Just because they say possibly linked to AmRen, doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that they presented AmRen as a publication which is anti-Semitic, anti-government and pro-ZOG conspiracy.</p>

		<p>Without a doubt Mr. Taylor you must initiate legal actions against the media outlets who published this story, and the originator of the libelous memorandum.  You have a very strong legal position and any number of attorneys would jump at the chance to take this case on a contingency basis.</p>
<p>Most probably they would settle the case out of court and the settlement would fund American Renaissance for years to come.<br>

		<p>Even this morning(1/10)the FOX5 NY affiliate was running with the, &#8220;American Renaissance = an anti-government, antisemetic &#8216;hate group&rsquo;&#8221; story. It was mentioned by the anchors multiple times beginning with their early show which kicks-off at 4:30am. This was, of course, hours after Fox News Channel had aired Jared Taylor&rsquo;s statement(at least in part)condemning this dubious, alleged DHS nonsense themselves. Thus it is clear, no effort was made to verify this &#8220;hate&#8221; accusation(even with their own sister station), but they just ran with it anyway - so alluring is the opportunity to sqeal about &#8220;anti-semitism&#8221; and &#8220;hate!&#8221; Just disgraceful all around. </p>

		<p>Daily Mail of UK, is more prone to being sued. Daily Mail ran with this story in the United Kingdom and outright used every word of the memo as fact, even after evidence pointed otherwise. In the UK, you could sue someone for libel much easier than in America. If Amren has any base or organizational support in UK, that group should sue the Daily Mail, they completely tarnish and trashed journalism with their smears.</p>

		<p>Bad ink is better than no ink. Anything that puts American Renaissance in the news will draw people to this website. Many will like what they see and buy a subscription to the magazine. <br>
 <br>
American Renaissance is not a hate group. It is an organization that presents facts and insights not available elsewhere, but which deserve to be part of the political debate. </p>

		<p>So, according to the Anti-Defamation League, AmRen &#8220;promotes pseudoscientific studies&#8221;.  And, as we all know, nothing gets published by the ADL except blind peer-reviewed scientific articles, right?  Boy, &#8220;anti-defamation&#8221;?  Talk about Orwellian.</p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;m at it: &#8220;supposed decline of American society&#8221;.  Ah, yes, only a bunch of extreme right wing racist crazies could possibly believe the country is in decline, right?  And that such decline might be connected to immigration?  Well, luckily we can point to the fiscal health and low crime example of California to put that conjecture to rest.  Christ, is it really worth even responding to this stuff? </p>
<p>Regarding Fox&rsquo;s reporting the rumor that AmRen had ties to the shooter, O&rsquo;Reilly spent his program yesterday lambasting the NYT and other media for stating falsehoods about Fox and the Republicans.  O&rsquo;Reilly should file this edition of his show under &#8220;Glass Houses, Stones&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Sorry, I can&rsquo;t stop.  ADL calls New Century / AmRen a &#8220;self-styled think tank&#8221;.  The mainstream media really operates on a write-by-numbers mentality.  You can write this stuff in your sleep.  </p>
<p>Please take down the following simple rules for future reference: 1. If a think tank is liberal, just refer to it as a &#8220;think tank&#8221;, no adjective; 2. If mainstream conservative or libertarian, it is a &#8220;right wing think tank&#8221;, and feel free to add &#8220;extreme&#8221; if there is even the faintest whiff of any pre-1965 views; 3. If a think tank is paleo-, race-realist or advocates any view that could not comfortably fit into Fox New&rsquo;s view of conservatism, it is &#8220;self-styled&#8221; (i.e. neanderthals with intellectual pretensions). </p>
<p>There are other simple write-by-numbers schemes for other types of articles as well.  Writing a piece on crime?  Please follow the following simple rules  1. white perp, black vic: hate crime, all races named; 2. hispanic perp, black vic: hate crime, only victim&rsquo;s race mentioned; 3. black perp, white vic: a [fill-in lesser-crime] gone wrong, no race mentioned; 4. black perp, hispanic vic: unfortunate gang violence; 5. muslim perp, white vic: a wonderful opportunity to remind us of the latent danger of anti-muslim bigotry and violence; 6. white perp, muslim vic: uh, has there been a single instance of this post-9/11?; and, of course 7. white mentally distubed psychotic perp: right-wing crazy with likely ties to&hellip;gasp&hellip; AmRen!!</p>

		<p>I was listening to Chip Berlet on the arch liberal KPFA when dropping off my kids to school.  Berlet was clearly denying that AmRen was anti-semetic but the rambled into something about a second constitution and how their rhetoric was racist.  </p>
<p>My guess is that much of the liberal media will want to drop this story down the memory hole as fast as they can now that it appears to not have legs.  Any sort of in depth reporting regarding AmRen and all things jewish will quickly yeild that much of the info is flattering because they cover the hbd aspect, something the msm has no desire to cover at all.  </p>

		<p>How true this is! I have never visited USA but am well travelled through most of Africa, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region so have come across many of these &#8216;buffoons&rsquo; operating in their own countries. They would appear to be almost identical and held in the same low esteem as DHS. A few years ago, on a public blog site, several hundred participants had their accounts &#8216;hacked&rsquo;;- nothing serious or malicious, just mildly annoying as anyone with a computer will confirm. We all received many identical messages all from the same source and all simple &#8216;spoofs&rsquo; or &#8216;spam&rsquo; which only lasted 2 or 3 days. Having read the first message, I trawled through the rest simply ticking check boxes as I went along then hitting &#8216;delete&rsquo; once. However, there was one blogger who simply flipped at this invasion of his workday privacy and ranted about wasting valuable government office time reading and then deleting these messages as he was far too busy and had enough to do already. I felt rather sorry for this poor guy and wondered why he didn&rsquo;t simply request some basic training on how to recognise spam and how to deal with it without blowing a fuse. But then he actually posted his office details on the same site, and I kid you not, I was so astounded that I made a careful note for future reference. He included his full name and the fact that he worked for Department of Homeland Security, Intelligence and Advanced Analytics, Office of Information Technology, U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He also listed his work and blackberry numbers and his email address. Now that&rsquo;s security.<br>

		<p>When the first announcement came of the possible like between the shooter and AmRen, I happened to be looking at the AmRen site. I stared for a moment and wondered how they were connecting the two. I&rsquo;ve never see this site publish anything that could be construed as anti-semitic. I wrote Fox News, telling them this very thing. I think all channels have decided now that their &#8220;rush to judgment&#8221; was wrong and are now trying to mend fences. I see ridiculous laws being proposed to clamp down on free speech. I hope cooler heads prevail and everyone will realize this heinous crime was committed by one, lone, unstable young man and stop the inflamatory rhetoric.</p>

		<p>The MSM, whether Fox or another, apparently has built-in guidelines regarding race realists.  Any professed idea about race and IQ automatically brands this person a eugenist and believer in ZOG.  Worse, media commentators have recently abandoned any concern whatsoever with reality and routinely make up their own facts.  The assertion about Giffords being the most highly placed Jewish female is an example, regardless of the origin of this statement.  </p>

		<p>Agreed, the mental health of our friends is important. Here in California, it&rsquo;s terrible the way the mentally handicaped are treated. If you don&rsquo;t have someone to assist in their daily lives, they rarely get any assistance at all from health facilities. When they shut down most of those facilities in the 70&rsquo;s / 80&rsquo;s, thanks to Ronnie Raygun, everywhere that wasn&rsquo;t frozen over in the winter became the domain of the psychotic. 0 compassion from the Raygun administration carried into the federal government and so many cuts were made to the mental health community that people like JLL will never recieve the help they need until they explode and are given the death penalty or life and swept under the rug. i think Ronnie actually thought that having mental problems was a choice. 6h well live and learn, or maybe it&rsquo;s wait til someone you love gets murdered then you learn.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Yes, and I notice that they consistently refer to any AR supporters who cannot readily be tarred as &#8220;rednecks&#8221;    &mdash;   anyone who can spell a three-letter word  correctly   &mdash;     as &#8220;pseudo-intellectuals&#8221;.   That term occurs repeatedly in their literature. You will nver find an intellectiual on the racial right,  only pseudo-intellectuals.</p>
<p>Even a celebrated  scientist and Nobel winner like Dr. James Watson who ventures outside the box to express doubt about official racial policies is  dabbling in &#8220;pseudo-science&#8221;.   It&rsquo;s made to sound like alchemy, astrology, or witchcraft.   If such an eminent  person cannot be smeared as a &#8220;pseudo-intellectional&#8221;,  then he is at best &#8220;misguided&#8221; or perhaps just getting  senile and  the poor old fool is  now ready for retirement (real quick!). </p>
<p>So, everything presented on sites such as AR is  &#8220;pseudo-scientific&#8221;, written and read by &#8220;pseudo-intellectuals&#8221;. </p>
<p>Aha! I think I&rsquo;m getting it.</p>
<p>And anything to the right of Karl Marx is &#8220;right wing&#8221; or  &#8220;extremist&#8221; or &#8220;self-styled&#8221; .   But there is no extremist  self-styled left wing   &mdash;    just normal, sensible writing and thinking by normal sensible people.    And while non-whites and &#8220;minorities&#8221; have legitimate self interests  which they have every right to pursue,  whites do not.   Thus,  anything manifesting an interest in racial matters  (from a white point of view) is &#8220;racist&#8221;,  just as anything recognizing white  rights or interests is &#8220;nazi&#8221; or  &#8220;white supremacist&#8221;. </p>
<p>These loaded terms carry an implicit sneer which tells the public that such groups are beyond the pale and are to be avoided at all costs. These groups have been branded as pariahs by The Powers That Be.</p>
<p>What would the media do without these  handy crutch words that they rely on so heavily?     How could they write their  slanted stories if these tired words were suddenly  all yanked from their dictionaries? Some words are loaded with overtones and connotations. Thus, it&rsquo;s not just what they say about us, it&rsquo;s the words they use.</p>
<p>Talk about bias in the media!   At first, we hardly notice  because it&rsquo;s so common. But when you really look, it&rsquo;s all over the place.<br>

A couple of new things we found out about the suspect:</p>
<p>1. He wanted the new American national currency to be marijuana</p>
<p>2. He built an occultist altar in his back yard.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>More weirdness! From what I&rsquo;ve been reading in the (Tucson) local newspaper, the family was rather strange too. So this development should not be all that surprising.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reported that his father is not known to have worked in years, and apparently rarely leaves the house (if ever). Neighbors say they seem like nice people but keep to themselves. The house is the only one on the street surrounded by dense shrubbery. One neighbor says that when he meets Loughner&rsquo;s mother in the supermarket, she &#8220;never&#8221; has less than one 30-can case of beer in her cart. Another neighbor says that she had already noted strange behavior in Loughren as a boy, talking to himself and threatening neighborhood kids.</p>
<p>Then, of course, he was rejected by the Army and expelled by his community college where the students and faculty were &#8220;terrified&#8221; of him. Nor could he keep a job, respect authority, or comply with simple rules. Obviously, he was out of control, and his parents were unable to cope. </p>
<p>And then there was the interest in bizarre, occultish subjects and conspiracy thories. And the rambling, meaningless babble that should have given away a disjointed mind.</p>
<p>It would seem that this home was a pressure cooker with the heat building up. Something was bound to happen. I have always maintained that some people ought not to have children. This is a good example.</p>

<p>Ronald Reagan was the governor who shut down California&rsquo;s mental health facilities. So did every governor in the country.  It was not something the governors and Ronald Reagan came up with on their own.</p>
<p>They had no choice.  A federal Judge agreed with an ACLU, NAACP, ADL, National Lawyers Guild etc lawsuit that it was an infringement of mentally ill persons civil rights to institutionalize them.  I was working in the mental health for criminals at the time.  Believe me, the governors including Ronald Reagan had no choice but to obey the Judge&rsquo;s order or go to prison.</p>

		<p>loughner belongs to the Venus Project.  It is one of those totally insane, absolutely impractical environmentalist groups.</p>
<p>They seem to advocate the total destruction of humans so that the earth may return to its natural state of 1 billion years ago.</p>
<p>They also absolutely believe that they can teach the wolves who have been recently re-introduced into the western states to become vegetarians.  This will alleviate the conflict between the wolf lover lunatics and the ranchers irritated with the wolves devouring their sheep and cattle.</p>
<p>Loughner doesn&rsquo;t like elected and appointed officials because they refuse to go along with the lunatic environmentalist maniacs.</p>
