<h1><a href="https://news.discovery.com/space/to-mars-zambias-forgotten-space-program.html">To Mars! Zambia&rsquo;s Forgotten Space Program</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Ouellette, Discovery News, January 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Edward Makuka Nkoloso informed the TIME reporter [in 1964] that his Zambian &#8220;astronauts&#8221; would beat both the US and the Soviet Union in the space race  &mdash;  by going to the moon, and then to Mars.</p>
<p>This was an unusual boast, to say the least. At the time, Zambia&rsquo;s population numbered 3.6 million, with barely 1500 African-born high school graduates and less than 100 college graduates. Nkoloso himself was a grade-school science teacher, and self-appointed director of the country&rsquo;s (unofficial) National Academy of Science, Space Research and Philosophy.</p>
<p>But he had big dreams, namely, using a catapult-inspired &#8220;firing system&#8221; to send a 10x6 aluminum and copper rocket holding ten Zambians and a 17-year-old African girl (and her cat) to Mars. He figured he could get them to the moon by 1965. All he needed was $700 million from UNESCO to fund the project.</p>
<p>In a newspaper editorial, Nkoloso claimed to have studied Mars for some time from telescopes at his &#8220;secret headquarters&#8221; outside Lusaka, and announced that the planet was populated by primitive natives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard not to like Nkoloso, based on what little we know of him today. Here&rsquo;s a grade school science teacher setting up his own national space program with a small group of trainees who had to roll downhill in a 44-gallon oil drum as part of Nkoloso&rsquo;s plan to simulate the sensation of rushing through space. Zero gravity? He simulated that by having them swing from the end of a long rope, cutting the rope when they reached the highest point so they went into freefall. He also taught them how to walk on their hands, &#8220;the only way humans could walk on the moon.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>&#8220;They won&rsquo;t concentrate on space flight; there&rsquo;s too much love-making when they should be studying the moon,&#8221; he complained. Indeed, the much-touted girl astronaut, Matha, became pregnant and her parents brought her back to their village.</p>
