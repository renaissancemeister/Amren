<h1><a href="https://www.eagleforum.org/column/2011/jan11/11-01-14.html">Detaching the Anchor from Anchor Babies</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phyllis Schlafly, Eagle Forum, January 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s long overdue for Congress to stop the racket of bringing pregnant women into this country to give birth, receive free medical care, and then call their babies U.S. citizens entitled to all American rights and privileges plus generous handouts. Between 300,000 and 400,000 babies are born to illegal aliens in the United States every year, at least 10 percent of all births.</p>
<p>We have tolerated an entire industry called &#8220;birth tourism,&#8221; offering &#8220;birth packages&#8221; costing thousands of dollars, to import pregnant women from all over the world, Korea to Turkey (12,000 U.S.-born Turkish babies have been arranged since 2003). An electronic billboard in Mexico, advertising the services of an American doctor, proclaims, &#8220;Do you want to have your baby in the U.S?&#8221;</p>
<p>The advantages of birthright citizenship are immense. The babies get Medicaid (including birth costs), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, and food stamps. Obviously, the baby shares his goodies with his family.</p>
<p>As soon as the child becomes an adult, he can legalize his parents, bring into the U.S. a foreign-born spouse and any foreign-born siblings. They all can then bring in their own extended families, a policy called chain migration.</p>
<p>Rep. Steve King (R-IA) has stepped up to this challenge and already has 26 co-sponsors for his bill, H.R. 140, to define citizenship. It states that the &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction&#8221; phrase in the Fourteenth Amendment means a baby born in the United States only if one parent is a U.S. citizen, or a lawfully-admitted resident alien, or an alien on active duty in the U.S. armed services.</p>
<p>Rep. King is not trying to amend the Constitution. He is simply using the Fourteenth Amendment&rsquo;s Section 5, which gives Congress (not the judiciary, not the executive branch), the power to enforce the citizenship clause.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, overruled the Dred Scott decision wherein the U.S. Supreme Court declared that African Americans could not be citizens. {snip}<br>
The Fourteenth Amendment denied citizenship to American Indians, even though they obviously were &#8220;born&#8221; in the U.S., because they were subject to the jurisdiction of their tribal governments. Congress did not grant citizenship to American Indians on reservations until 1924, 56 years later.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is no ambiguity about the solemn oath that all naturalized Americans must take. &#8220;I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so help me God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any naturalized U.S. citizen who claims dual citizenship with his native country betrays his solemn oath. If anchor babies have citizenship in their parents&rsquo; country, they should not have U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>{snip} The Rasmussen poll reports that 58 percent oppose it, while only 33 percent favor it.</p>

		<p>Negatives associated with America&rsquo;s increasing diversity are topics so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; syndicated columnists studiously avoid   &mdash;  - probably because newspapers would drop their columns otherwise. </p>
<p>But once in blue moon a conservative synicated columnist WILL have something intelligent to say.  George Will&rsquo;s column below on the folly of rewarding illegal entry of the U. S. with citizenship for any offspring born of such a violation is an example.</p>
<p>How to end birthright citizenship<br>

		<p>I can already hear the cries of racism go out. But the illegals who stand to benefit from this the most, their counter argument that it is racist or unfair does not hold water. One only needs to mention that virtually all European countries have passed legislation which prevents automatic citizenship going to babies born to illegal immigrants. And nobody squawked about those laws when they were passed, as everybody over there knows that a nation has the right to say who is and who is not a citizen. But it appears that Republicans are going to push the hardest for this and the Latino lobby will smear the whole Republican party as a bunch of racists for endorsing this legislation.</p>

		<p>Anchor babies usually become gang member anyway.  We should stop giving away US citizenships to idiots.  It would be easier to deport children of illegals who joined gangs if they are not US citizen.</p>
<p>Anchor babies citizenship should be delayed until they finish college.  This way, the illegal immigrants would see to it that their future sponsor is an upright citizen and they would keep their number of children to one or two so its easier for them to discipline them.</p>
<p>We have to control what is happening in our country now.  Everywhere there are Latino gangs, and to think we funded their welfare and education.<br>

		<p>Although this great, common-sense column only hinted at the topic &#8216;dual citizenship&rsquo;, this is another insanity that MUST be eliminated - and I don&rsquo;t mean for all &#8216;other&rsquo; foreign nations, with a devious exception hidden within the fine print for just one specific foreign nation.</p>
<p>No dual citizenship status allowed for ANY nation,  means exactly that.</p>
<p>And, any American  citizen - especially an American politician - to place his or her loyalty to a foreign nation ahead of their loyalty and responsibility to America and it&rsquo;s native citizens - that American should have their citizenship revoked and face deportation to their favorite foreign nation.    </p>
<p>Oh, lest I forget:  Let&rsquo;s make this a one-way, permanent ticket, with no possibility of return.</p>

		<p>Canceling birth citizenship for illegals will be such a hard fight.  This goes to the heart of the leftist agenda to build a brown, multicultural paradise.  It is part and parcel of their plan to break the white hold on power here.  They are not ashamed to say that this is what they want.  They will fight this tooth and nail, and I&rsquo;m not sure we can succeed.  At the very least, it needs to be made retroactive or it will only delay the inevitable by a few decades.</p>

		<p>The court precedent for both anchor babies and tourism babies is the Wong Kim Ark decision.  Here is the concise statement of the question asked of the Court for the WKA decision, written by Hon. Horace Gray, Justice for the majority in this decision.    <br>
	&ldquo;[W]hether a child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at <br>
the time of his birth a citizen of the United States by virtue of the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>For WKA to justify birthright citizenship, the parents must have &ldquo;&hellip;permanent domicile and residence&hellip;&rdquo;  But how can an illegal alien have permanent residence when the threat of deportation is constantly present?  There is no statute of limitation for illegal presence in the US and the passage of time does not eliminate the legal remedy of deportation.   This alone invalidates WKA as a support and precedent for illegal alien birthright citizenship. </p>
<p>Legal aliens can indeed have a &ldquo;&hellip;permanent domicile and residence&hellip;&rdquo; and WKA appears to be written for this class of persons.  However, we note that if the parent or parents are unemployed (or unemployable), or if they get their living by illegal means, then they are not &ldquo;&hellip;carrying on business&hellip;&rdquo;, and so the children of indigent or criminal legal aliens may not be eligible for birthright citizenship.  This is a more extreme point, and its main use may be to show the poor quality of the WKA decision.  </p>
<p>Because the statement of the case for WKA appears to addresses only children of legal immigrants, it is not an applicable precedent to justify birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Occasionally foreign couples take a trip to the US during the last phase of the wife&rsquo;s pregnancy so she can give birth in the US, thus giving birthright citizenship to the child.  This practice is called &ldquo;birth tourism.&rdquo;   The WKA case description states that not only shall permanent residence be a factor for birthright citizenship, but also doing business.  While &ldquo;birth tourism&rdquo; parents may be legally present in the US, a temporary visit answers neither condition.  WKA is therefore disqualified as justification and precedent for a &ldquo;birth tourism&rdquo; child to be granted birthright citizenship.  </p>

<p>I am uncomfortable with that, because we should not be doing anything to encourage anchor babies to go to college. We don&rsquo;t need anchor baby college grads. Such grads will then move into positions of power where they can influence the national political process or in other ways control us and rule us. Bad enough having anchor babies as dish washers, but we don&rsquo;t need them as PhDs!</p>
<p>And I agree with Luke about the dual citizenship ploy. But, as he correctly says, any attempt to abolish it will surely involve special exemptions cunningly hidden deep within the fine print. Without those very special exceptions for certain cases, the bill will NEVER pass, and any politician foolish enough to support it will be committing political suicide. He would never hold political office again, not even as dog catcher! No politican would be so stupid as to cut his own throat this way.  Hence, as things are now, this amounts to nothing more than daydreaming. </p>
<p>This highlights one of our big problems with our present political system:  career politicians who are looking out for their own careers rather than for the people they &#8220;represent&#8221;.  One of the things that we need to abolish is the concept of career politicians.</p>

		<p><i>For [the Wong Kim Ark decision] to justify birthright citizenship, the parents must have &ldquo;&hellip;permanent domicile and residence&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>That should answer the issue in itself. Illegals  who have trespassed in this country are analogous to a burglar who has stealthily entered your home without your knowledge or permission. Both are there illegally.  Neither one has &#8220;permanent domicile and residence&#8221; there.  There is no logical way that a person here illegally can simultaneously have a legal residence here.</p>
<p>And regarding &#8220;birth tourists&#8221;, even if they entered the country legally, this country is not their &#8220;permanent domicile and residence&#8221;, nor are they engaged in &#8220;carrying on business&#8221; here. That too should settle the issue. </p>
<p>In the cases of both illegal entrants and birth tourists, their &#8220;permanent domicile and residence&#8221; remains in their home countries, not here. </p>
<p>Thanks to Tusky for providing those details.</p>

		<p>Until fairly recently, the Irish Republic conferred Irish citizenship - and hence automatic EU citizenship - upon all born in the Republic.</p>
<p>Until it was obvious to all - even the We-ought-to-love-the-Third-World softies who abound in Ireland - that Nigerian and Cameroonian women, to name just two very conspicuous nationalities, were flying into the country in pre-organised groups, just as Turks, Chinese and Koreans are currently doing in the USA.</p>
<p>I am fairly sure that there is a well-established industry - visa, accomodation, ante-natal care, maternity ward, paperwork etc., all done for a set fee - throughout East Asia; it is certainly true of the Philippines, Korea and China. </p>

		<p>Does anyone else feel like it&rsquo;s useless to even discuss these things anymore?</p>
<p>It feels like nothing will change.  And we&rsquo;ll wind up absorbing the rest of the world, especially the third world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly depressing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even like to imagine where this country would be had the politicians in the 60&rsquo;s exercised true courage and vision.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate anyone.  But I love white people and it&rsquo;s important to protect our genetic integrity.  (If other races what to protect their genetic integrity, that&rsquo;s fine too.)</p>
<p>God bless all kind-hearted, respectful, intelligent, race-realists.  </p>
