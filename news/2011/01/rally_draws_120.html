<h1>Rally Draws 1,200 to State House</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John O&rsquo;Connor, The State (Columbia), January 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The rally, sponsored by the S.C. NAACP, drew more than 1,200 to the State House&rsquo;s north plaza, where the battle flag flies as part of a Confederate soldier monument. A 2000 legislative compromise moved the flag from the State House dome to the monument, but the NAACP wants the flag removed from the grounds entirely.</p>
<p>The rally&rsquo;s most heated moment came early, when S.C. NAACP president Lonnie Randolph spoke of a December formal ball in Charleston marking the 150th anniversary of the state&rsquo;s secession. The celebration was an insult, Randolph said, similar to celebrating the massacre of Native Americans at Wounded Knee, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or holding a 9/11 party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The King Day rally, held on the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, has served as a way to mark the slain civil rights leader&rsquo;s legacy, as well as renew efforts to remove the flag from the State House grounds and maintain the NAACP&rsquo;s tourism boycott of the state until the flag is gone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s rally also focused on S.C. efforts to pass an immigration bill modeled after a controversial Arizona law. That law, the constitutionality of which is being challenged in federal court, allows law enforcement officers to stop and check the citizenship documents of suspected illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Separately, some members of Congress, including U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have proposed repealing parts of the 14th Amendment that grant citizenship to anyone born in the United States.</p>
<p>The 14th Amendment, noted Wade Henderson, a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights advocate, was ratified, in part, to ensure freed slaves were citizens after the Civil War.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you hear people talking about segregating out a group of people,&#8221; Henderson told the crowd, &#8220;you better listen.&#8221;</p>

						<p>
							<i>Free North Carolina, January 17, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>From: C.M. Sullivan<br>
Subject: Geo. Washington banned from NAACP rally<br>
Date: Monday, January 17, 2011, 2:17 PM</p>
<p>The annual MLK observance at the state house in Columbia SC had an interesting twist this year. The event is held on the north side steps of the statehouse. Prominent at that location is a large bronze statue of George Washington. This year, the NAACP constructed a &#8220;box&#8221; to conceal the Father of His Country from view so that participants would not be offended by his presence.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t &#8220;compromise&#8221; with blacks. Once they smell blood, they want it <i>all</i>, and nothing less will do.  &#8220;Compromise,&#8221; to blacks and browns, means &#8220;Gimme half today  &mdash;  and <i>all</i> of it tomorrow.&#8221;  Pandering White liberals never learn this.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip; and maintain the NAACP&rsquo;s tourism boycott of the state until the flag is gone.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Oh?  And how&rsquo;s that boycott coming, fellas?  Brought South Carolina to its knees yet?</p>

<p>Hey, no unbiased journalism here, is there, Comrade John O&rsquo;Connor?  Gotta make sure the masses know the Correct party line on Arizona&rsquo;s laws.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The 14th Amendment, noted Wade Henderson, a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights advocate, was ratified, in part, to ensure freed slaves were citizens after the Civil War.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Meaning&hellip;what?  That Evil White Racists are gearing up to reinstate slavery?  Blacks have the strangest obsessions.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;When you hear people talking about segregating out a group of people,&rdquo; Henderson told the crowd, &ldquo;you better listen.&rdquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And who&rsquo;s being segregated, Comrade Henderson?  As far as I can see, it was only George Washington, and the White heritage he represents.  How would it sit with you, Comrade, if some pro<i>White</i> group were to block off a statue of your god-hero MLK in order to avoid &#8220;offending&#8221; Whites?  Who&rsquo;s segregating who, Comrade?</p>
<p>Keep it up, fellows.  The more over-the-top and outrageous your childish demands grow, the fewer Whites are listening.<br>

		<p>Probably just as well to coverup George Washington before someone there blew up or stole the statue.</p>
<p>George Washington was a very brave, smart, and honorable person who should be a mentor figure for all Americans of any color who want to succeed in life.  Anyone who reads his history will find what a truly outstanding person he was and how his beliefs and actions lead to remarkable results.</p>
<p>So what does covering Washington tell you about the thinking of this group of people who would be offended by seeing the statue?</p>
<p>Now you understand why winners are winners and losers are losers.<br>

		<p> The brazen effrontery of these blacks is exceeded only by the shameless fawning over them always done by the news media on &#8220;MLK Day.&#8221; Not a single effort is made to balance the hosannas sung to King&rsquo;s memory with comments from any of the millions of Americans who view this whole &#8220;holiday&#8221; as a farrago and a disgrace.</p>
<p> The &#8220;boxing up&#8221; of the statue of the Father of Our Country so blacks would not be &#8220;offended&#8221; by the sight of him, really puts the icing on the cake. Shame on Confederate flag supporters for not mounting a counter-demonstration, and on the populace in general for not protesting loudly at this insult to George Washington. Hopefully next year something will be done to keep these &#8220;MLK&#8221; people from committing such a sacrilege again.</p>

<p>White Humanity is beginning to wake up to what the blacks have in store for us once they get critical mass and can do more of what they please.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t look for any White politicians to pass a resolution of condemnation for offending Whites by covering our great historic first non afrovoodoo president.  We haven&rsquo;t reached that point yet, but White Christ willing, we soon will&hellip;<br>

		<p>Blacks need their own country. They need a place where they don&rsquo;t have reminders of White excellence shoved in their faces at every turn, making them feel inadequate. They need a place where they can live in the manner of sub-Saharan Blacks prior to the days of slavery without being punished for failing to live up to the standards of White civilization. They need a country without rigid written laws concerning behavior, building codes, drug abuse and sexual activity.</p>
<p>They need a country that has a well-guarded fence around it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before, but this article is also a valid opening for this thought.  The future of the South belongs to the African-American.  There isn&rsquo;t any way the White Southerners can out breed the influx of Blacks coming into the South from both internal and external/foreign immigration, especially when combined with the current birth rates of the races.  There may be Whites moving into the South, but they are not Southerners, and when it comes to a future racial conflict they will also be the first to leave.  I predict a future Black Nation made up of much of the Souther Slave States.  It&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>

		<p>This is what many people have not fully considered.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, what happened to the statues of Lenin and Stalin?  Torn down by the mobs.  </p>
<p>When whites are a minority in this country, what will happen to all statues of the good guys?  Jefferson, Washington, Frankiln?  The new majorities will have them removed and replaced with MLK and Chavez and even Che. </p>
<p>This sort of thing has already happened here and there, both to historical flags, statuary and place names.  In 50 years, you will think that white men had never been here or built anything, and the &#8216;social justice&rsquo; liberals who are pushing all of this anti-white and anti-american hatred will have planted fertile seed in the hearts of the non-whites to commit genocide against us.  They will feel fully justified and the history will have been sufficiently altered to make them seem righteous in their eradication of us.</p>

		<p>Well, let&rsquo;s cut these NAACPers some slack; perhaps they covered up Washington out of some kind of consideration or deference<br>

		<p>Blacks can never be patriotic or citizens because they hate the USA and its history and its founders.  This picture speaks a thousands words.  They cover up a man who had the moral strength to reject a crown when it was offered to him while honoring the whore monger and communist MLK who beat white prostitutes, drank heavily, and hoped for the death of Whites the world over.  Blacks have never been and will never be a part of this country or any other country because they are tribal and incapable of adapting to civilization.  </p>

		<p> We certainly are two separate cultures. Hiding the George Washington statue is an outrage. Blacks want no reminders of the past but will infringe on White advancements since they make few technological or intellectual contributions.<br>

		<p>Those ba&hellip;..s!  They cover Washington&rsquo;s statue.  Where would they be if not for men like Washington?  <br>
In 1963 I was at the March on Washington, listening to Dr. King&rsquo;s speech, buying into the whole racial equality myth.<br>
By the way, the tiny percentage of blacks with an I.Q. over 110 know that they are the rare exceptions.  They know that the vast majority of blacks are not capable of much in the way of skilled labor or civilization building. So, when someone like Obama comes along - and I would not venture to guess his I.Q., but if he is really so bright, why does he not release any of his school records? - they fawn over him.  If Obama were white, would anyone say he is especially bright, or that he speaks well?<br>
I doubt it.  He benefits from the double standard that if a black person is not obviously of low intelligence, then he is considered bright and exceptional.  <br>
Is it not a crime - maybe a violation of some kind - to cover a statue in a public place?  What would happen to me if I covered a statue of MLK?</p>

		<p>This is a real headshaker. The statue of the father of our country is hidden so as not to offend blacks, while they honor a man of questionable moral character? They probably wouldn&rsquo;t belive some of the charges against MLK if confronted with the truth - or worse still, they wouldn&rsquo;t care. While I&rsquo;m on the subject, I&rsquo;ve been puzzled for years why blacks want to be called African-Americans. My ancestors came from Europe many years ago (pre-Revolutionary times)and I&rsquo;ve never visited there. I do call myself an American and would not think of calling myself a European-American. Most black have never been to Africa and their race has been here a long time too. Why can&rsquo;t they drop the hyphenated names and just say, &#8220;I am an American?&#8221;</p>

Yet we know this is revisionist nonsense, but still the Beck&rsquo;s and mainstream conservatives continue to pretend otherwise&hellip;and far too many White fools play right along!</p>

<p>hehe, that quote went along good with the photo of Washington all covered up. If he&rsquo;s so concerned about &#8216;segregation&rsquo;, perhaps he should be concerned about segregation in some of the neighborhoods in the District of Columbia and in some of the suburbs. The black neighborhoods he&rsquo;s so proud of. Perhaps he should be concerned about the shameful lack of white there, and concerned about things like the whites even killed in these areas, and about what he could do about it?</p>
<p>In my town right now they are putting on a play directed by Mike Wiley. It&rsquo;s about a black man killed by whites. That&rsquo;s what the story is about. How about a play and similar consciousness raising about the 10 times greater number of whites killed by African Americans, back to the start of the civil rights movment and to the day the first Africans set foot in the new world. </p>

		<p>Nearly every day, blacks and their white liberal buddies do something to make things worse for themselves  &mdash;  which, in the long run, is good because it enlivens the opposition.  If no black or liberal commenter will speak out against such a stupid action, then Americans can only assume that no one in these groups opposes it  &mdash;  including the present President.</p>

		<p>JUNE-&#8220;While I&rsquo;m on the subject, I&rsquo;ve been puzzled for years why blacks want to be called African-Americans..&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can fault them for this. It is natural for most people to associate a nationality with an ethnicity and race  &mdash;  for example we think of Japanese and Chinese as oriental, and English and German as white. Historically, America has been an overwhelmingly white nation, so it is understandable (to me, anyway) that blacks would feel they needed a different term that described them and gave expression to their heritage, and differentiated them from the white-norm.<br>
People on this site are apt to say that &#8216;America is a white country&rsquo; and rightly so. But if this is the case, what are blacks in America supposed to describe themselves as?<br>
All people have a yearning to an ethnic and racial identity. If America becomes nonwhite, and America becomes synonymous with non white people, I&rsquo;m sure many whites in America will find themselves in a similair existential dilemma.</p>

		<p>Does anyone believe Washington would have wanted to see what his nation became? A teeming mass of angry blacks celebrating their hatred of whites and demanding more handouts? A black-run-America that is steadily on the decline? A nation that honors MLK and Malcolm X and disparages Jefferson and Washington? A country that elects a ridiculous mulatto as president? A land where whites are too scared to oppose any act of black aggression (except anonymously on the Internet)?</p>
<p>We should be thanking the NAACP for this small act of mercy! Much worse when they say that MLK and BHO are in the same tradition as Washington and Jefferson.</p>

<p>Actually, we want whites, all of &#8216;em, to listen to these outrageous demands, and notice that George Washington has been boxed in so as not to &#8216;offend&rsquo; blacks. The more whites that see this, hopefully the better, shove it in their faces if you have to, there&rsquo;s an election coming up and not one politician that I know of spoke up against this outrage.

<p>George Washington was the father of this great nation those people feed off. To cover his statue because it is offensive is the equivalent of Romans covering up a statue of Julius Caesar, it is like the twilight zone.</p>
<p>However, it does not surprise me, most blacks can barely comprehend their own five historical figures (almost all in the past century), and so it does not surprise me that they would not care to understand the vast and rich history that whites possess. White history will only be protected by whites; no one else is connected enough to it to care. Whites all over the nation (or ANY American for that matter) should protest this and make this organization regret the day they hid our nation&rsquo;s father! </p>
<p>They just know that George Washington &ldquo;had slaves&rdquo; and that is only because their leader told them so, they probably do not even realize he was the first president. <br>

&#8220;&hellip;three-sided structure that covered the front and sides of the statue was intended to display a rally graphic and serve as a photo-and-television backdrop for the event&rsquo;s speakers, said S.C.

<p>Photos from the event showed a three-sided box with Washington&rsquo;s statue visible only from behind the stage. &ldquo;What we had constructed was a background with a graphic to be placed on it,&rdquo; James said. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t trying to obstruct anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The simple fact is that if people like Washington did not have slaves, those blacks wouldn&rsquo;t even be here today.  However much they grumble about it, they owe their presence in North America to slavery. Without slavery, they would still be in Africa, living as Africans do. Do they think they got here by their own means on their own ships?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;What we had constructed was a background with a graphic to be placed on it,&rdquo; James said. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t trying to obstruct anything.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>I see plenty, plenty of space in the area where they could have put their &#8220;graphic&#8221;.  Did they have to put it very neatly, exactly,  right around the statue of Washington?  Liars! They can&rsquo;t even fib well. </p>

		<p>I cannot say who the person was other than one of the older special agents in the FBI.  This gentleman was privy to the infamous MLK tapes.  These are surveillance recordings of MLK first approved by Pres. Kennedy and then later Pres. Johnson.  It was widely thought that MLK had communist ties and was trying to start a revolution.  Well, it was found he did have ties to the Soviets and others by collecting &#8220;donations&#8221;.  And as a byproduct of their investigation it was also found that MLK was a sex fiend that would have younger members of his entourage scout out women for him as he arrived in a new town.  Just prior to his death he had a mother and daughter come &#8220;visit&#8221; him.  First it was decided that these tapes would be released 25 years after his death, when the 25 years was close to completion the date was suddenly changed to 50 years.  Does anyone doubt that these tapes will just disappear one day?</p>

<p>#47 Anon:</p>
<p>Do you consider the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, King&rsquo;s close personal friend a close enough source?  How about the assistant director to the FBI who personally heard the MLK tapes?</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t do enough research.  Therefore, I will help you and add a few helpful links for your edification:</p>
<p>From the late Sam Francis:</p>
<p><i>Mr. Brennan, who had served as Assistant Director of the FBI, stated that he had personally been involved in the FBI surveillance of King and knew from first-hand observation the truth about King&rsquo;s sexual conduct &mdash; conduct that Mr. Brennan characterized as<i><b>orgiastic and adulterous escapades, some of which indicated that King could be bestial in his sexual abuse of women.</b> [emphasis in original] </i></i></p>
<p><i>It was this kind of conduct, he wrote, that led FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to describe King as &#8216;a tom cat with obsessive degenerate sexual urges&rsquo; and President Lyndon Johnson to call King a &#8216;hypocrite preacher.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/yan2rk3</p>
<p>And this from <i>Newsweek</i> Magazine 1-19-1998, page 62:</p>
<p><i>There FBI bugs reportedly picked up 14 hours of party chatter, the clinking of glasses and the sounds of illicit sex  &mdash;  including King&rsquo;s cries of&hellip;&hellip;</i></p>
<p>(see link for more details)</p>
<p><i>Martin Luther King was having sex with three White women, one of whom he brutally beat while screaming the above mentioned quotes. Much of the public information on King&rsquo;s use of church money to hire prostitutes and his beating them came from King&rsquo;s close personal friend, Rev. Ralph Abernathy in his 1989 book  And the Walls Came Tumbling Down.</i></p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/4c77p63</p>
<p>There, that should get you started!  And I&rsquo;d say those are pretty good sources, wouldn&rsquo;t you?  Happy reading.</p>
