	<p><big><b>Modern Day Trojan Horse:<br/>
The Islamic Doctrine of Immigration<br/>
Sam Solomon &amp; Elias Al Maqdisi; ANM Publishers, 2009; 139 pp., $14.95</b><big><big><big>&nbsp;</big></big></big></big></p>
<p>As the West has accepted extensive immigration from Islamic countries, unexpected social and political problems have followed. While rising crime rates, rampant unemployment and a heavy load on our much-appreciated welfare systems are severe problems in itself, a distinct and dramatically more significant problem is the subtle subversion of our free and democratic societies, also known as &#8220;Stealth Jihad&#8221;.</p>
<p>The retired Islamic scholar Sam Solomon, in this compact book &#8220;Al-Hijra, The Islamic Doctrine of Immigration&#8221;, connects the dots and explains why seemingly unrelated incidents are in fact rooted in Islamic tradition and are steps on the path to create a fully Islamized society.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how this functions, Sam Solomon dives into his exhaustive knowledge of Islamic history and law. As Islamic scholars everywhere, he derives his conclusions from Islamic scripture, the life of Muhammad in particular, and shows how historically immigration has slowly but steadily lead to formerly Jewish or Christian societies submitting to Islam. The primary example in the book is Muhammads takeover of Yathrib, today known as Medina, and how the concepts and strategies developed for the conquest of a relatively insignificant Arab city are being duplicated by Islamic leaders worldwide, with the same goal: Expanding Islamic conquest ever further.</p>
<p>The depth of knowledge and connections described in Al-Hijra constitute both a strength and a weakness. Most important is the strength: Sam Solomon uses his Islamic scholarship to reveal the justifications and machinations being applied to undermine and attack the very notion of a secular society. This is important information that everyone involved in these matters deserve to have.</p>
<p>The weakness is that the book frequently becomes hard to follow. Understanding Islamic terms like Darura (necessity), Takweem (empowerment), I&rsquo;dad (readying) etcetera are important in order to counter the undercurrent of Islamization, yet the denseness of the presentation makes the lines of thought hard to follow for the unprepared. One does well in having some knowledge of Islamic thought before reading Al-Hijra.</p>
<p>That said, this book is indispensable for a very simple reason: It presents information otherwise not available to the uninitiated Westerner, and mercilessly reveals the twisted logic of Islamist activists, their justifications, methods and ultimate goal: A fully Shariah-compliant society. By pointing out the scriptural justifications and inner logic of seemingly benign and unrelated Muslim demands, it provides an invaluable tool for identifying and countering the stealth jihad destabilizing our societies. Dismantling this threat peacefully requires knowledge as provided by Sam Solomon.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The subversion against our societies is executed by relatively few immigrants. Most immigrants from Islamic countries do not come to the West in order tor transform free Western countries into semblances of the autocracies or theocracies they have fled from. They seek better living conditions, employment, a better future  &mdash;  but they do so without the intention to change their religion, and this is where things get complicated.</p>
<p>Retaining faith in Islam and Islamic scholars will lead the immigrants to tacitly support the subversive aims of Islamists who have also come to the West, initially as a relatively small fraction of millions of Islamic immigrants. These Islamic leaders and scholars use the Islamic teachings to destroy confidence in Western democracies, and they are astonishingly effective in achieving that aim.</p>
<p>Explaining how this seemingly irrational development can take place requires some history. This first and foremost means the life and conduct of Muhammad, the perfect example for the pious Muslim even today. The authority of Muhammad is absolute in Islam, be it in form of Quranic commands or the examples of conduct recorded in hadith collections, known in Islam as the &#8216;Sunna&rsquo;. Hijra, immigration, was a key element in Muhammads takeover of Yathrib, today known as Medina.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the concept of Hijra is not limited in time or space to 7th century Arabia. The command as given is absolute, and remains an obligation on Muslims. One of many hadith quotes Muhammad for this:</p>
<p>I charge you with five of what Allah has charged me with: to assemble, to listen, to obey, to immigrate and to wage Jihad for the sake of Allah.</p>
<p>Thus, immigration is step four out of a five step plan. Sam Solomon elaborates:</p>
<p>So Hijra or migration is binding on all Muslims for numerous reasons; the most important being that migration is preparatory to jihad with an aim and objective of securing victory for Islam and Muslims either in another country or generally as a community.</p>
<p>Those who do not desire to live in an Islamic theocracy better take heed. Over the last decade we have observed how jihad has come to the West in various forms. The most obvious is the violent, like train bombings in London and Madrid, and more recently even in immigration-friendly Sweden where a cartoon drawn by Lars Vilks has become a pretext for detonating bombs during Christmas shopping.</p>
<p>However, more important than the flagship violent jihad is the so-called &#8216;Stealth Jihad&rsquo;, where Islamic law (Shariah) is quietly being implemented in our societies, usually in seemingly benign aspects of life, but leading to a constant affirmation of Islamic identity being more important to Muslims than honest integration in the host societies. Sam Solomon quotes extensively from scripture and interpretation, pointing out how Islam in itself constitutes a barrier to integration.</p>
<p><b>The strange concept of &#8216;necessity&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The Islamic doctrine of &#8216;necessity&rsquo; is a strange twist in these problems. For Muslims are permitted to ignore any and all Islamic rules if &#8216;necessity&rsquo; dictates it, even to the point of openly denying his or her religion, a move also known as &#8216;Taqiyya&rsquo;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Later, when the Islamic community feels strong enough, cases are seen where Muslim shop workers start protesting having to handle these &#8216;unclean&rsquo; items, and demand an exception due to their &#8216;religious needs&rsquo;. Demands for gender segregated swimming halls, prayer breaks, prayer rooms and eventually mosques follow similar patterns, where items that were initially not a concern suddenly become demands voiced with strong conviction of their necessities. Employers and public institutions tend to yield to such Islamic demands, not noticing that this is a slippery slope towards implementation of Shariah.</p>
<p><b>Shariah  &mdash;  a totalitarian system of state</b></p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Islam today consists mainly of its legal code, the Shariah. Islamic law is derived from the life and actions of Muhammad. Codifying his life into law has been a major undertaking by Islamic scholars through the centuries, resulting in detailed manuals of conduct like Reliance of the Traveller, which describe in detail how a pious Muslim is supposed to behave. This all-regulated way of organizing a society is also known as &#8216;totalitarian&rsquo; (Wikipedia):</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The grand ambition of Islamists is to implement this system everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p><b>Easing the burdens: Tay&rsquo;seer and Darura</b></p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Rejecting the lifestyle of non-Muslims is one of those difficult challenges, in particular for converts who usually would come out of a Christian or secular background, be accustomed to having a beer or a glass of wine, to women having equal rights with men, and to religion being a private matter. Changing the mindset from one of reason to one of irrational religious zeal takes great effort, and has a great potential of conflict. The application of Tay&rsquo;seer permits this transition to be quite gradual, but must also be seen in light of the polar opposite, the doctrine of Darura (&#8216;need&rsquo;).</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The unsettling implication of this that Muslims, at large, cannot be trusted to respect secular law, even if superficially it would appear that they do.</p>
<p><b>Be prepared: Tamkeen and I&rsquo;dad</b></p>
<p>Now for something disturbing: the Islamic concepts of tamkeen and i&rsquo;dad. Tamkeen (&#8216;empowerment&rsquo;) is the strengthening of Islamic identity (as opposed to assimilating into the host society), and is a fundamental precondition for establishing Islamic rule. Without a significant number of persons identifying with being Muslims, having faith in Islamic scripture and its interpreters, Islamic leaders would have no cadres to base their authority upon, and thus no chance to seize power and establish Islamic rule in the land.</p>
<p>The next step, i&rsquo;dad, is the practical preparation for seizing power in the land. This means building and strengthening Islamic infrastructure in the land, building networks and making Muslims proudly display their Islamic identity in public. I&rsquo;dad also constitutes the practical preparation for the final physical effort to establish Islamic rule in the land, executed by a well-prepared army of soldiers fighting in the Cause of Allah, also known as jihad. Physical fighting would be a foregone conclusion at this point. For that reason, military training and accumulating weapon stocks are natural parts of i&rsquo;dad. Logically, finding weapons in mosques or other Islamic buildings is a stark sign of warning to the host societies.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p><b>Closing thoughts</b></p>
<p>George Orwell in his novel &#8220;1984&#8221; described how the Western world might have fallen to the totalitarian temptation, as did F. A. Hayek in &#8220;The Road to Serfdom&#8221;. This decay of our free societies into totalitarianism have not taken place on its own, but might come about through religious authority and pressure.</p>
<p>Sam Solomon describes the mechanisms used for this purpose, and is clear about what we must do to stop it. It is the task of our politicians to take heed and do so. Sam Solomon, as usual, is unrivalled in his profound understanding of the problems. Reading and re-reading the compact books of Sam Solomon is an excellent way to gain the knowledge needed for this task.<br/>

<p>It amuses me to no end thinking about how these PC dregs would be horrifed into stunned hysteria if Muslims were successful in getting Sharia law instituted in the US and Europe, after their support of Muslims and their abject denigration of Christianity as fanatics, or as one PC scammer on here described them as &#8220;nut cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forced to pray five times per day and wash their feet repeatedly would in themselves be too much for them to bear to say nothing about their inability to make happy hour and get juiced to the gills lambasting conservatives as whackos.  </p>

		<p>Communism and Islam are both extreme ideologies that stifle quality of life. They both are all-controlling, all-consuming social and economic systems that are totally incompatible with our secular, free, modern, democratic, capitalist way of life.  Both systems lead to social, economic, and scientific stagnation = backwardness and poverty.</p>
<p>We recognized the threat of communism and we did everything possible to destroy it, with extreme prejudice.  Islam is actually worse than communism.  It controls you 24 hrs a day.  It tells you what to wear, what to eat, when to eat, how to date, and who to marry.  For women, homosexuals, and anyone who thinks,it would be Hell on Earth.  </p>
<p>In the 1950&rsquo;s we refused to hire Communists.  We would not allow them to immigrate.  We searched them out and deported them or threw them in jail.  Our CIA assassinated them. We went to war to destroy them. Yet, today, we do nothing against an even greater threat.  </p>
<p>PC and multiculturalism has made the entire Nation insane! </p>
<p>Muslims have over 40 Islamic countries in which they can live.  They do not need to live here. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Communism and Islam are both&hellip; incompatible with our secular, free, modern, democratic, capitalist way of life&#8221;.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m reading the masses incorrectly&hellip; however the way I see it, our &#8216;modern democratic way of life&rsquo; seems to consist of accepting a Marxist style outlook on life, and promoting &#8216;hatred&rsquo; of white, heterosexual males. Hating white, heterosexual men is perfectly compatible with Islam, that&rsquo;s why there are no sanctions or stigma against Islam and our institutions even favor it, actually. There are only a few gays who are truly worried about Islam (as an after thought) but I suppose they will voice no real objections for the sake of the &#8216;common good&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Ths solution to this is to embrace white men as &#8216;victims&rsquo; and oppressed. It has the added bonus that it&rsquo;s true. Once &#8216;Marxism&rsquo; has then been truly set aside in the minds of the public, perhaps then we can counter the Islamic viewpoint. This could be the very reason painting whites as victims, in the minds the smart folks, is the most evil, Nazi thing you can do. This is what they Really don&rsquo;t want you to do. </p>

		<p>The best way to hide something is in plain sight. The Muslims tell us exactly what they are going to do, how they are going to do and then they do it. If China or Russia had secret plans to invade the West, we would spend billions on spying and a means to counteract their invasion plans. The Muslims hide their plans in plain sight and we do nothing.</p>

<p>I agree. I will add that Blacks have many all- Black countries in which they can live, and Latinos/Hispanics have many, many choices as well. The same cannot be said for Whites. Yes there are still majority White countries, but I have trouble thinking of an all-White  country. In fact, the White race seems to be the only race WITHOUT a country that is exclusively White. Go figure.</p>

		<p>Islam is incidental. The main factor is the degeneracy of the West. In 1900, hoards of non-Westerners would never have been allowed to colonize the West. Today these invaders are welcomed, western governments subsidize them and facilitate their social penetration. Islamic, African, Hispanic, Asian, Indian, etc. they have the same goal: mug the stupid European man, before some other mugger does!</p>

<p>And as Hayek noted in &#8220;The Road To Serfdom&#8221;, totalitarianism has academic roots that lend it credibility. The same is true in the case of academically sponsored multiculturalism which tolerates the intolerable. Thus the academy provides the credibility for the religious authority and pressure.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t a problem in Russia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 25% Russian - grandfather fought in the White Army against the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>My awakening came in the late 1970s when I saw the nightly telecasts of dark, hairy Muslim mobs in Tehran during the sacking of the US Embassy and the hostage crisis. I knew that Jimmy Carter would never fight/kill any of these horrible people, in contrast the Russians had invaded Afghanistan. I was for the Russians against these ugly mountain Muslim tribesmen, while the idiot Ronald Reagan Conservative types were obsessed with hating &#8220;the Russians&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then my 2nd awaking was my great excitement that an all White Russian Soviet team beat John Thompson&rsquo;s 98% Black Olympic basketball team in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Russians are great and Russia now has a great leader Putin, who uses brutal violence to keep the Chetnian Muslim throat killers in their place and also teaches Oligarch financial scammers not to interfere in Russian politics - anybody see any strong White man like Putin in the USA to handle the same exact problems?</p>

		<p>Anonymous at 7pm, you wrote about the totalitarian socio- economic system that is Islam and I agree with you.  We have to be on our guard though.  If enough charges are made that Islam is not a religion but an all encompassing ideology/way of life we may find that all or parts of it are permitted to be taught in our schools. These people have used every means, foul or fair, to permeate our society; it might only take a few legislators to pronounce Islam as a socio-economic system for the Islamic leaders to then demand lessons a la Marxism, Capitalism or any other non-religious &#8216;ideology&rsquo;.<br/>
We have to start anticipating their moves, however ludicrous it may appear at the present time.  We are in a double bind and they know it, we permit freedom of religion so have to hire them,treat them with respect, etc yet as with the Communists they are here to undermine us. <br/>
We know who to thank for this disastrous situation.</p>

		<p>Islam is an all-controlling cult and conquering philosophy, posing as a &#8220;religion&#8221;.  One cannot attack Islam on religious grounds, because in the USA we have &#8220;Freedom of Religion.&#8221;   However, we can negate that argument by exposing Islam for what it is: a dangerous extremest cult.  </p>
<p>Islam is far, far more dangerous than the other &#8220;cults&#8221; that the USA government has attacked and destroyed, such as the one in Waco, TX, Jim Jones, the polygamous Mormon off-shoots, etc.  If the government can blow up, burn out, and kill those &#8220;cults&#8221; (composed of American citizens), they can certainly do the same to the foreign-invader Islamic cults, which pose a much greater threat to our wellbeing.  </p>

		<p>It is very clear what the Islamic culture and the people of are capable of and they are exorcising it perfectly here as they have done in other countries already. I am aware of several townships here in Virginia that are under attack by the Islamic movement that presents itself as passive initially, then passive aggressive. But when confronted they will lie, steal, cheat and even kill to promote and move their agenda forward and all these actions are blessed and promoted openly by their fanatic religion. <br/>
They are the purist of evil hiding in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.       </p>

Much of Eastern Europe is almost all-white. Ironically, many of those countries can thank communism for that feature. By making them poor and thus undesirable destinations for anyone, it protected these countries from hordes of immigrants wanting to get into their countries. Of course, now that the economy of Eastern Europe is on the rise (relative to the communist era) they&rsquo;re starting to get nonwhite immigrants, but the problem isn&rsquo;t nearly as advanced as it is in the west, where it&rsquo;s already a crisis,or in the US, which I consider almost a hopeless case. Hopefully they will recognize the threat in time, as the problems caused by the immigrant hordes in western Europe become more pronounced. Indeed, it may be that the east will be the destination of refugees from the increasingly Islamized (and browned) west.</p>
