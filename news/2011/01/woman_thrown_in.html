<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cynthia Colston told My Fox Orlando that she called after the nail technician became aggressive with her when she refused to pay as much as the store was charging for nails that she said were too short.</p>
<p>When a deputy came, she said he was entirely unhelpful and called the emergency line again because she found him unhelpful when he told her she could not file charges.</p>
<p>That time, she said, she told the dispatcher that it was a non-emergency call and she just wanted to see what else could be done for her situation.</p>
<p>That, according to authorities, is not a good reason to tie up the emergency phone line.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Colston was arrested after she called the line two more times  &mdash;  which she said she accidentally dialed because she was dialing with her knuckles.</p>
<p>But that was enough for authorities to arrest Colston on charges of misues of the 911 system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Volusia County official told My Fox Orlando that their problem with Colston&rsquo;s use of the system was that there was a deputy standing right next to her who could help her with whatever she was calling the emergency line about.</p>

		<p>Oh Yes, Yes, I bet he called her the N word, he needs to have his tongue cut out. Here we have a fine hardworking black lady being abuse by a racist white America. And to call her the N word, oh my that is awful. I thought most of these Nail People were of Asian Decent?</p>

		<p>&#8220;But that was enough for authorities to arrest Colston on charges of misues of the 911 system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her complaint was not really surprising. But when I held that job in NYC, I never heard of anyone being arested for abusing the system. (They should have been!)</p>
<p>My very first day on the job, I had a very agitated woman (obviously black) call to demand some cops to help her get her son out of bed. She said she couldn&rsquo;t get him to move. Send a patrol car right away! </p>
<p>I pictured a small child who was unconscious.  I asked her how old he was. She said sixteen.  I asked her what was wrong with him. She replied (indignantly) that nothing was &#8220;wrong&#8221; with him. He just refused to get out of bed and go to school because he had no fresh socks to wear!</p>
<p>I swear that is the truth! I was flummoxed.  I turned to the supervising sergeant and asked him what I should tell her.  He calmly replied, &#8220;Tell her it&rsquo;s not a police emergency.&#8221;  And so I did. But not without getting cursed out. (&#8220;What are you&%@*# damn cops good for anyway?&#8221;)</p>
<p>Crazy calls like that were not unusual from Harlem.</p>

		<p>And this mind set with all the accompanist catering by the libtards who are frightened to death of being called racist is what is turning this country into a &#8220;Nanny&#8221; state. Everybody should just drop everything and rush to the aid of the poor, downtrodden brown people. Or you will be called a RACISSST. </p>

<p>Once, when seeking Director Information, I accidentally dialed 911 instead of 411. When the operator answered, &#8220;911, what is your Emergency?&#8221; I gasped at my mistake, apologized profusely for tying up their line (for a few seconds), and hung up hoping she wouldn&rsquo;t report me to the phone company. </p>
<p>And yet this Florida woman   &mdash;   with the afrocentric scarf on her head as well as a familiar afrocentric dull-witted countenance   &mdash;   thinks she can waste Emergency&rsquo;s time over a bad manicure. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say people like her are more of an &#8220;Emergency&#8221; for our country than even the worst manicure could ever be. </p>

		<p>I once locked up a woman for the abuse of the 911 system. Big, black, stupid, bad attitude. She wanted a ride home. I told her that she got here somehow, and to figure out how to get back the same way. I told her that the only ride she would get from me was to jail, and not to come back. </p>
<p>She called again, and I locked her up. I was the hero of the 911 center for a while, as she used to call with all sorts of stupid stuff. But you would not believe how much trouble I got in over doing that! </p>
<p>Black run town = ineffective, hug-a-thug police department.</p>

		<p>MVSN #4, my take on why so many black women call 911 for silly stuff:  they still have the &#8220;massa, help me!&#8221; slave mentality.  Most black MEN probably don&rsquo;t call because the cops will find out they have outstanding warrants.  </p>

		<p>The mind of a child: Exaggerated sense of importance; inability to perceive the needs of others; delayed gratification absent. Very low IQ is what is causing these ridiculous 911 calls.</p>

		<p>She was dialing the phone with her knuckles?  This reminds me of so many Government employees with ugly gigantic nails that get paid to do nothing.  This woman&rsquo;s attitude is reminiscent of a Chinese Emperor who wants to show everyone that he is too important to use his hands.  </p>
