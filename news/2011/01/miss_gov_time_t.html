<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41039623/ns/politics-more_politics/">Miss. Gov.: Time to Build Civil Rights Museum</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Wagster Pettus, MSNBC, January 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Possible presidential contender Gov. Haley Barbour  &mdash;  under fire recently for comments that critics claim minimized the problems of Mississippi&rsquo;s civil rights era  &mdash;  said Tuesday night that his state should build a museum dedicated to the movement. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barbour said 2011 is a good time to move forward with the museum in Jackson. He said that was because it is the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Riders&rsquo; journey that challenged racial segregation and the 150th anniversary of the start of the Civil War.</p>
<p>&#8220;The civil rights struggle is an important part of our history, and millions of people are interested in learning more about it,&#8221; Barbour said. &#8220;People from around the world would flock to see the museum and learn about the movement.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Barbour criticized earlier for comments on segregation</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Mississippi civil rights museum was first proposed in 2007 but stalled over discussions of location and funding. Barbour said four years ago that a museum should be built with private donations. He did not offer a funding proposal Tuesday night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Just when you thought you had enough reasons to vote against Republicans, they give you another!</p>
<p>At this point, the only moral thing for Gov. to do is just surrender his job to the first black who wants it.  Doesn&rsquo;t matter who, the results will be all the same.  Might as well give it to a prison janitor or a &#8220;distinguished, renowned, esteemed African American scholar&#8221; at Ole Miss.  I just won&rsquo;t matter. You can&rsquo;t tell the difference.  <br>

		<p>The interest in &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; is long past! If a museum was such a great idea, why is it that the MLK center in Atlanta is mired in debt? (other than his corrupt kids raiding the funds)</p>
<p>Blacks do not, do not have the patent on civil rights. My civil rights are denied me by my local government when I wish to bear arms to protect myself or my family. Yet Mayor Daley has a phalanx of armed cops and an ambulance at his beck and call. Will this museum promote my civil rights? Even recognize that white people have any? </p>
<p>Blacks being denied civil rights essentially never happens anymore. Countless lawsuits and affirmative action has whites terrified to hire or fire blacks due to fear of litigation. Blacks assault whites and it never makes the news. When one white assaults a black, it&rsquo;s a national headline! Ask the Duke La Crosse players about their civil rights. Will they get a space in said museum? </p>
<p>There has not been one white on black lynching since 1964! Our federal office of civil rights even goes to the extent to dig up Emmit Till every half century or so, allegedly looking for evidence, and every white politician looks guilty and remorseful at his reburial. His casket is now enshrined in the Smithsonian, another talisman of white guilt.   Enough! Whites, asians, everyone has more than paid back American blacks for slavery, discrimination, et all ten times over. When will it end? </p>
<p> Black on black crime continues unabated and ignored, with no hue and cry to address it. If someone wants a civil rights museum, let them build it with private funds. Call Bill Gates or Bono&hellip; they love funding hopeless endeavors.  They will get not one dime from me. I pay every week for black entitlements to live off my labors in taxes. </p>

Endless pandering to black ruled America and all for naught.</p>
<p>The only reason museums to victim-hood have high attendance numbers is because school children are bused in every day. If school kids weren&rsquo;t forced to go to these museums, they would be empty.</p>
<p>I go to museums because I want to be inspired, not lectured to about how allegedly evil white humanity is.</p>

		<p>Actually, apart from white liberals in the US, a few white liberals in Europe, and American blacks, no one really gives a hoot about the Civil Rights movement. It would probably be a net drain on the state&rsquo;s resources.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d rather see the dinosaur bones in the natural history museums a hundred times before I&rsquo;d choose to undergo self flagellation at a &#8220;civil rights&#8221; museum.  So I doubt that the proposed museum would be a great boon to Mississippi&rsquo;s economy.  But if it must be built Governor Barbour was right the first time   &mdash;   do it entirely with private money (hit on Soros and Dees for the money), don&rsquo;t steal from taxpayers for this thing.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s about time we honor the civil rights struggles of the millions of nameless, faceless victims of racial discrimination who get turned away from colleges, jobs, and contracting opportunities because they are white and who often get denied basic rights to freedom of speech and association.  I&rsquo;m personally looking forward to the exhibit on civil rights hero Jennifer Gratz, who overcame racism and death threats to get a landmark anti-discrimination law passed in Michigan.</p>

		<p>He makes a reasonable comment on the situation in his state during times past, gets hammered for it, and sees his chances of running for Pres evaporate.  So what does he do?  He shamelessly panders to the diversity crowd by saying &#8220;now is the time&#8221; to build that civil rights museum NOBODY wants - not even blacks.  Whites won&rsquo;t visit the museum, blacks won&rsquo;t pay the entrance fee, nor donate to build it, nor donate for it&rsquo;s upkeep.  Isn&rsquo;t it funny how politicians of any stripe always try to garner votes through stuff like this, as long as it comes out of the White tax payers&rsquo; pockets?  WE get to pay for nonsense like this merely so this bozo MIGHT have a shot at running for Pres (and NO chance of winning).  Barbour is toast.  No chance.  Had he stuck to his original statement with conviction and backbone, maybe.  But he has shown himself to be like all the rest of the politicians - more than willing to spend the tax payer money, more than willing to cow tow to the diversity and permanently aggrieved crowd, and unwilling to defend ANY conviction of his own at the first whiff of criticism.  That is NOT what we need in ANY elective office.  </p>

		<p>Barbour is thinking of running for president, so this suggestion of his is just a scamming by one more political hack trying to be all things to all people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really absurd since he&rsquo;ll get maybe 1 per cent of the black vote and probably lose about 5 per cent of all white voters.</p>
<p>I wonder if he can be persuaded to understand that, as a pres contender, he has about 10% of the charisma of low charismatic people like Bob Dole and John McCain?  Such huge egos politics make.</p>

		<p>Cincinnati built the National Underground Railroad Museum and Freedom Center shortly after our infamous riots of 2001.</p>
<p>It was funded by both private and public contributions, and continues to be somewhat of a financial drain on the budget-challenged city.  It has recently requested federal assistance.</p>
<p>Considering the poor attendance and financial difficulties after they&rsquo;re built, how many of these tributes to the &#8220;black struggle&#8221; do we actually need?  For me, one is at least twice as many as I&rsquo;d care to support.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that back in the evil old pre-civil rights days (1950s, say) that Memphis neighborhood was white, safe, pleasant, and had good schools.  So the museum does stand as a testament to the legacy of civil rights, though few people will &#8220;get it&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Mississippi Republican Gov. Haley Barbour is not advocating a museum in his state to honor the civil rights movement because it is politically correct. He is doing this because it is politically necessary for any credible presidential contender to be on record as supporting what the clear majority of white Americans consider to be a settled issue.<br>
 <br>
Black crime and illegitimacy are legitimate concerns.  They should be discussed more publicly than is currently the practice. Nevertheless, no political movement has a future that advocates a repeal of the civil rights legislation passed in the 1960s.  </p>
