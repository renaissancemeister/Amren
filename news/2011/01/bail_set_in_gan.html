<h1>Bail Set in Gang Rape of 14-Year-Old Girl</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pat Curry, Nancy Loo and Dennis Sullivan, Chicago Tribune, January 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three teenagers and a man gang-raped a 14-year-old girl and recorded the attacks on a cell phone, police said this morning.</p>
<p>Alex Picallo, 16, Majeed Khalifeh, 18, and Jonathan Leanos, 19, were charged Wednesday with two counts each of aggravated criminal sexual assault in the incident at Leanos&rsquo; Stickney home in the 3900 block of Wesley on Saturday, police said. Picallo was charged as an adult.</p>
<p>A fourth suspect, Vicente Hernandez, 22, of Cicero, was similarly charged today. In a hearing this afternoon before Cook County Judge Colleen McSweeney Moore at the Bridgeview Courthouse, Hernandez was ordered held in lieu of $600,000 bail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Leanos met the victim, who does not live in Stickney, online on the MySpace site last summer, and they met several times before Leanos took the victim to his house Saturday, police said.</p>
<p>When she refused his request for sex, Leanos took her cell phone and forced her to have sex, police said. He then drove her to pick up Khalifeh and Hernandez, and they all returned to Leanos&rsquo; house, where they were met by Picallo, police continued. Leanos told the girl to have sex with his friends, and cell phones were used to record the assault.</p>

		<p>These are the immigrants who are flooding our schools and communities.  This is a picture of the Third-World horde that our government is fostering on us.  What chance will your children have when America is only 20% White?  </p>
<p>This demographic projection is not a fantasy   &mdash;   in fact leftist regularly tout such projections with joy and pride. As recently as 1970, America was 85% White.  Today America is ~ 60% White, but among elementary school children (the next generation) only 50% White.  This ethnic cleansing has happened in only 40 years!  Imagine in another 40!  Our government is doing this to us   &mdash;   they are purposely replacing us with Third Worlders.  This is our future!</p>

<p>What was the Arab doing in their group? Most gangs are ethnically exclusive, and Hispanic gangs doubly so. Did he lie about his ethnicity to them and pose as a Hispanic?

		<p>Interesting, when I had my &#8216;diversity in learners&rsquo; class in college, and we went to observe a class of HS students. On the day we observed, a panel of Muslim students spoke before the high school. These students were paraded out as if they were the definition of diversity and enlightenment and all the other students in school could learn from their enlightened ways and their culture, especially the ignorant and backward and racist white students. So, when Jesse Jackson says &#8216;we&rsquo;re not going back&rsquo; is this what he&rsquo;s talking about? We&rsquo;re not going back to the days were these Muslim students, for example, can be paraded about as yet another vibrant group superior to ignorant whites? And is this the result, street crime as a result of Muslim immigrants being disrespected and being victims of &#8216;racism&rsquo;?</p>

<p>Hispanics are just as bad as the blacks are. There was a high profile gang rape in CA a few months ago involving Mexican perps and a black (I think) against a White 16 year old during a school dance. The police said it went on for hours and it was one of the worst cases they have ever seen. Arabs (muslims) in Europe are just as bad about raping White Euro girls also.</p>

		<p>Georgia Resident, not only is there nothing to stop Muslim Arabs from crossing our porous border, but apparently these people ARE crossing the border regularly&hellip;and have been doing so for years.</p>
<p>Among the abandoned possessions lining the smugglers&rsquo; trails across border ranches, have been found such things as backpacks containing postcards from Cairo. Considering that we&rsquo;ve been hearing a &#8216;Dirty Bomb&rsquo; would easily fit in a backpack, it is insane that this situation has been allowed to continue.</p>

<p>Georgia Res.,<br>
I&rsquo;ve been saying that for the last 5 years and all I get are blank stares from my liberal/progressive colleagues. The average person couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference by looks only. I&rsquo;ve read that many of the Muslims (Arab or Paki) who are training in Venezuela are learning Spanish. <br>
The other possibility with this particular gang rapist is that he may be an Hispanic who has embraced Islam which is a perfect<br>
 &#8220;religion&#8221; for a machista misogynistic rapist.<br>

<p><br>
I&rsquo;ve said all along that Arabs and Hispanics have a great deal in common.  They are like two peas in a pod. They are both a racial mishmash, somewhere between black and white, but not quite either. In the future they could well blend and form a coalition against the common enemy   &mdash;   us.  Look at those faces: is there much difference between any of them?  </p>
<p>They are not even any particular race - a random dash of this and a casual dollop of that, all tossed together and none of it fitting well.  This is the dumbed down, degenerate, de-racialized future for America that the Marxist Utopians and the hostile elites are pushing on us. </p>
<p>Will this be the USA in a hundred years? Is this how our great-grandchildren will look?  Do we want this?  Is this any cause for us to &#8220;celebrate&#8221;?</p>

		<p>In addition to being vicious predators, these guys are stupid beyond belief; anyone who records their criminal activity on a mobile phone is merely providing evidence for prosecutors that will be impossible to beat at trial: the prosecutors will have the victim&rsquo;s testimony, the video footage and DNA evidence, and probably the perps will be eager to testify against each other (the saying there is &#8220;The last one to get on the bus gets the worst seat.&#8221;)</p>

<p>From another Georgia resident, excellent points which I, too, have been trying to cram into peoples&rsquo; heads. I ran across this very situation a couple years ago. When business was booming, a man I knew had a lawn maintenance crew of Mexicans. This man was fluent in Spanish and a new guy was hired and just stared at the boss blankly whenever he gave him intructions. After frustration set in,  the man&rsquo;s head  [Mexican] worker came to him and told him, &#8220;He no understand, he not one of us - he not Mexican.&#8221; Come to find out his new &#8216;Mexican&rsquo; hire was actually an Afghan, who came up through Mexico.</p>

		<p>The one with the Arab name is most probably latino.  Look at the shape of the mouth and small chin.  He could be biracial also with an Arab father and latino mother.</p>
<p>Poster #8 wrote - &#8220;That was my day of awakening, when I driving by a playground in a German founded town and saw very few white children.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the same thing that got me to thinking about all this &#8216;who is an American&rsquo; stuff.  About five years ago I noticed that there were NO white children almost everywhere I went in the big city I live in now.</p>
<p>I mean, there are schools on every other street corner, but they are all bursting to the seams with non-white children of every variety. 99.99% of the time you see not a single white child in the crowds AT ALL.</p>
<p>Almost all the teachers are white, but most admins above and ALL support staff below (janitors, parent coordinators, etc) are non-white.  What, are whites the only ones smart enough to get teaching credentials?  Even after decades of affirmative action?</p>
<p>Even in so called &#8216;white&rsquo; neighborhoods, that have undergone a dramatic shift in the last 10 years since I&rsquo;ve been here, there&rsquo;s no white kids.  Where are they?</p>
<p>That got me thinking about the whole race replacement thing because I was seeing it with my very own eyes.  The same liberals that cheer our demise then go to bat for Tibetans who are being race-replaced.  Such hypocrites.</p>

		<p>Friends in the armed forces are universal in saying that neither Iraqis nor Afghans can recognize a (properly kitted out and cultured up) Hispanic from one of their own.</p>
<p>It was a major opportunity missed in infiltrating the various mosque and coffee house based muslim resistance groups whose &#8216;spiritual leaders&rsquo; (Muqtada Al Sadr) were arguing for more sectarian violence to spoil the occupation and make the puppet government look bad and later went so far as to suggest alliance with Iranian &#8216;advisors&rsquo; to stage a spiral of violence against the Americans and particularly other occupation forces themselves like, well, basically what happened in 2006-07 before The Surge.</p>
<p>A smart bomb here.  A sniper there.  A driveby at the right time etc. would have changed the entire &#8216;complexion&rsquo; of the war.  Speaking of which, Caucasian soldiers can grow thick beards to hide their face from a distance but as soon as they are seen close up, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>USSOCOM was caught flatfooted because Hispanic volunteers who make it (and there are a few) into SOF are almost all routed to the Southern Command taskings of Central and South America.</p>
<p>By the time they boned up on the proper dielectic Arabic or Pashtun etc. the opportunity had passed.</p>

<p>And from Jay:</p>
<p><i>What, are whites the only ones smart enough to get teaching credentials? Even after decades of affirmative action?</i></p>
<p>Comrade:</p>
<p>The requirements for a teaching credential are so low these days a monkey could qualify.  </p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m sure you know, we Whites are locked out of administrative positions, passed over repeatedly in favor of shockingly unqualified blacks and hispanics.  One of my colleagues (White Male, eminently qualified, highly educated, extremely personable) was passed over endlessly for promotion; the final time by a Nigerian who spoke unintelligible English and had questionable credentials.  </p>
<p>Said colleague was so angry at the blatant mistreatment and obvious racism that he tried to find out the reason why and was told he &#8216;didn&rsquo;t interview well.&rsquo;  Yeah, the non-Whites (or traitorous DWLs) in charge of hiring took one look at his White face and threw his application papers in the trash, while laughing at him behind his back.</p>
<p>Which White advocacy group should he have called?   Our own union, supported by our hefty dues, has specific branches for each and every ethnic/racial group imaginable, to protect and advocate for their rights, but for Whites&hellip;.nothing.  The system, you see, is still filled with Oppressive White Racism that must be Stamped Out!</p>
<p>My dear colleague finally went over the edge, dropped out and fell into a deep depression. I heard that he spent some time in a mental institution but I could never confirm this.  He now works for the county teaching inside a maximum security prison, says it&rsquo;s far less stressful in there and far more sane than a mainstream school   &mdash;   and a lot safer too.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a small world, Bon!  My last teaching job was inside a penitentiary.  Of course, I was paid in cigarettes, extra food, postage stamps and hootch, and I did this while an inmate, but it was also very pleasant work.</p>
<p>When I got out, some neighbors and I went to a blood drive.  I was told that I could not give blood because my B.P. was too low at 85/45 or something like that.  My old bosses before my arrest had my B.P. at 175/105.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to tell with any degree of certainty, of course. But I&rsquo;m inclined to disagree with some here  who speculate that  Majeed is &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;. He could be Egyptian, or even Palestinian.  In short, he looks the least &#8220;mongrelized&#8221; of the group. He is definitely from some racial border area, though.<br>
 <br>
But, on careful study of the faces, his features seem the most consistent and uniform of the four. (I&rsquo;m speaking relatively, of course.) The other three betray a more disparate assortment of mismatched components drawn from the various elements of the Spanish empire.</p>
<p>This might be beacuse the Arab empire had almost a thousand years longer than the Spanish to assimilate and reconcile its own  disparate conquests and to form a more consistent &#8220;type&#8221;. Nor did the Arabs encounter  and mix with such utterly distinct races as did  the Spaniards.</p>
<p>All this, I admit, is idle speculation. But study of the faces of these people - though scary and unattractive - is interesting.  This is what our race-replacement engineers want us to become!  </p>
