			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Chua, Wall Street Journal, January 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A lot of people wonder how Chinese parents raise such stereotypically successful kids. They wonder what these parents do to produce so many math whizzes and music prodigies, what it&rsquo;s like inside the family, and whether they could do it too. Well, I can tell them, because I&rsquo;ve done it. Here are some things my daughters, Sophia and Louisa, were never allowed to do:</p>
<p>* attend a sleepover<br>
* have a playdate<br>
* be in a school play<br>
* complain about not being in a school play<br>
* watch TV or play computer games<br>
* choose their own extracurricular activities<br>
* get any grade less than an A<br>
* not be the No. 1 student in every subject except gym and drama<br>
* play any instrument other than the piano or violin<br>
* not play the piano or violin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the term &#8220;Chinese mother&#8221; loosely. I know some Korean, Indian, Jamaican, Irish and Ghanaian parents who qualify too. Conversely, I know some mothers of Chinese heritage, almost always born in the West, who are not Chinese mothers, by choice or otherwise. I&rsquo;m also using the term &#8220;Western parents&#8221; loosely. Western parents come in all varieties. </p>
<p>All the same, even when Western parents think they&rsquo;re being strict, they usually don&rsquo;t come close to being Chinese mothers. For example, my Western friends who consider themselves strict make their children practice their instruments 30 minutes every day. An hour at most. For a Chinese mother, the first hour is the easy part. It&rsquo;s hours two and three that get tough.</p>
<p>Despite our squeamishness about cultural stereotypes, there are tons of studies out there showing marked and quantifiable differences between Chinese and Westerners when it comes to parenting. In one study of 50 Western American mothers and 48 Chinese immigrant mothers, almost 70% of the Western mothers said either that &#8220;stressing academic success is not good for children&#8221; or that &#8220;parents need to foster the idea that learning is fun.&#8221; By contrast, roughly 0% of the Chinese mothers felt the same way. Instead, the vast majority of the Chinese mothers said that they believe their children can be &#8220;the best&#8221; students, that &#8220;academic achievement reflects successful parenting,&#8221; and that if children did not excel at school then there was &#8220;a problem&#8221; and parents &#8220;were not doing their job.&#8221; Other studies indicate that compared to Western parents, Chinese parents spend approximately 10 times as long every day drilling academic activities with their children. By contrast, Western kids are more likely to participate in sports teams.</p>
<p>What Chinese parents understand is that nothing is fun until you&rsquo;re good at it. To get good at anything you have to work, and children on their own never want to work, which is why it is crucial to override their preferences. This often requires fortitude on the part of the parents because the child will resist; things are always hardest at the beginning, which is where Western parents tend to give up. {snip}</p>
<p>As an adult, I once did the same thing to Sophia, calling her garbage in English when she acted extremely disrespectfully toward me. When I mentioned that I had done this at a dinner party, I was immediately ostracized. One guest named Marcy got so upset she broke down in tears and had to leave early. My friend Susan, the host, tried to rehabilitate me with the remaining guests.</p>
<p>{snip} Chinese mothers can say to their daughters, &#8220;Hey fatty  &mdash;  lose some weight.&#8221; By contrast, Western parents have to tiptoe around the issue, talking in terms of &#8220;health&#8221; and never ever mentioning the f-word, and their kids still end up in therapy for eating disorders and negative self-image. (I also once heard a Western father toast his adult daughter by calling her &#8220;beautiful and incredibly competent.&#8221; She later told me that made her feel like garbage.) </p>
<p>Chinese parents can order their kids to get straight As. Western parents can only ask their kids to try their best. Chinese parents can say, &#8220;You&rsquo;re lazy. All your classmates are getting ahead of you.&#8221; By contrast, Western parents have to struggle with their own conflicted feelings about achievement, and try to persuade themselves that they&rsquo;re not disappointed about how their kids turned out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought long and hard about how Chinese parents can get away with what they do. I think there are three big differences between the Chinese and Western parental mind-sets.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;ve noticed that Western parents are extremely anxious about their children&rsquo;s self-esteem. {snip} Western parents are concerned about their children&rsquo;s psyches. Chinese parents aren&rsquo;t. They assume strength, not fragility, and as a result they behave very differently.</p>
<p>For example, if a child comes home with an A-minus on a test, a Western parent will most likely praise the child. The Chinese mother will gasp in horror and ask what went wrong. {snip}</p>
<p>If a Chinese child gets a B  &mdash;  which would never happen  &mdash;  there would first be a screaming, hair-tearing explosion. The devastated Chinese mother would then get dozens, maybe hundreds of practice tests and work through them with her child for as long as it takes to get the grade up to an A. </p>
<p>Chinese parents demand perfect grades because they believe that their child can get them. If their child doesn&rsquo;t get them, the Chinese parent assumes it&rsquo;s because the child didn&rsquo;t work hard enough. {snip}</p>
<p>Second, Chinese parents believe that their kids owe them everything. The reason for this is a little unclear, but it&rsquo;s probably a combination of Confucian filial piety and the fact that the parents have sacrificed and done so much for their children. (And it&rsquo;s true that Chinese mothers get in the trenches, putting in long grueling hours personally tutoring, training, interrogating and spying on their kids.) Anyway, the understanding is that Chinese children must spend their lives repaying their parents by obeying them and making them proud. </p>
<p>By contrast, I don&rsquo;t think most Westerners have the same view of children being permanently indebted to their parents. {snip}</p>
<p>Third, Chinese parents believe that they know what is best for their children and therefore override all of their children&rsquo;s own desires and preferences. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Western parents try to respect their children&rsquo;s individuality, encouraging them to pursue their true passions, supporting their choices, and providing positive reinforcement and a nurturing environment. By contrast, the Chinese believe that the best way to protect their children is by preparing them for the future, letting them see what they&rsquo;re capable of, and arming them with skills, work habits and inner confidence that no one can ever take away.<br>

		<p>Sounds like Radical Traditionalism to me.</p>
<p>Only a few Westerners practice it.</p>
<p>While generally approving of what this Chinese mother says, I would think that differences in personality among children must be respected, even while putting demands upon them.</p>
<p>I think this would be a big difference between the Orient and the Occident  &mdash;  we do not believe that everyone is alike and that one size fits all.</p>
<p>And it can get complicated.</p>
<p>But making them little buggers understand that we parents are the ones who have sacrificed and worked so that they can have certain benefits  &mdash;  what is wrong with that? And then expecting them to work hard? My kids used to study until two or three in the morning.</p>

		<p>This has been by far the most commented story at the WSJ website.</p>
<p>One question I have:  Doesn&rsquo;t the goal of &#8220;being number one&#8221; become meaningless when an entire population is supposedly striving for that same goal?  Only one person can be number one, the rest are all &#8220;losers&#8221;, in that mindset.</p>

		<p>If Asian academic success was really due to some special set of academic values inculcated by Asian parents, then why do Asians do better academically than whites even when they are raised by white parents?

		<p>&#8220;Chinese parents believe their children can be the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>And therein lies the reason why Asians do well in school.  There is absolutely no substitute for parental guidance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love to see those home schooling figures jump forward every year.  </p>

		<p>The real story here is not whether or not Chinese are better parents, or whether or not Asians have high IQs. The REAL story is that NO officially sanctioned media outlet in ANY White country will allow the publication of an article that declares &#8220;White Mothers are Superior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only White people are forbidden from declaring that they are better at anything.</p>
<p>It is just another aspect of a broad array of programs and policies that have the effect White genocide.</p>

		<p>I noticed a long time ago that most of the biographies on Westerners that I admired, had parents, especially fathers, that were extremely hard on them and expected nearly perfect.</p>
<p>Then, the thought occurred to me: &#8220;I am reading about this person because they have achieved enough in life that they are worth reading about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say what you want about tough parents, but the results propelled the West to the top.</p>
<p>We have lost that edge.</p>

		<p>Well I guess that is why everybody is different in the world. Because they don&rsquo;t follow some standard (Chinese) model. Life would be boring if it would be filled up with robots. Nobody is better than anybody, let alone superior.</p>

		<p>She married a white man, so this says alot about her views of the westerners and their lifestyle. I don&rsquo;t think she really believes what she is saying. She says it to establish a market for her POV in this West vs East Battle. Deep inside, she believes Whites are superior or else she would live in China or Asia. She married white and lives in a Western Nation. </p>
<p>The performance of Asians in America is not a universal representation of Asians. Most people in Asia can not read or have no schooling beyond the 10th grade. Up until the 1960s, the US basically had very strong quotas on Asian immigration and only Educated Asians were permitted to enter the U.S. So the Asians in America did well in Schools because they came from a selective population. However, if you compare the West to the East in economic performances, you will noticed the east isn&rsquo;t superior. I don&rsquo;t think One is superior or inferior to the other, they are different because ethnic/racial people are different biologically. Biology drives performance capacity, Culture is the product of biology. </p>
<p>As an Asian woman, this Amy Chua has craved out a very profitable nitch for herself in this western society. She did well in western schools and makes a good living selling her Eastern centric viewpoints in this western market. She married white and has half white children. She has done very well in this white/western civilization. </p>

		<p>Another big monkey wrench into white society.  I agree more white parents can do a better job of raising their children by pushing them to succeed and teaching them the basics of life like proper grooming and good manners.  However, the East Asian way is not the way to go about it.  As more East Asians flood into white countries and compete with white people you will see more and more people wanting us to adopt their work until you drop lifestyle which in turn will rob our precious white children of a childhood because &#8220;Bobby&#8221; Chen and &#8220;Laura&#8221; Kim are studying every waking hour to ace tests to compete for college spots against white children.  The first thing white parents should do to protect their children is not let East Asians into any white country.  If East Asians are so smart then they can build their own schools in East Asia.</p>

		<p>I totally agree.  the asians are completely superior.  that is why i implore them to please stay away from our putrid societies and stay in your own utopias of perfect people so we do not drag you down anymore. stop moving into all of our inferior white neighborhoods and attending our inferior white founded institutions like harvard yale and oxford in which you desperately flood into by the millions.  </p>

		<p>Wow, what a racist article! What if the headline had said &#8220;White mothers superior&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Chinese are obsessed with beating us at all costs. What the article doesn&rsquo;t tell you is that Asians have the highest cheating rates in U.S. colleges. There was a huge Asian cheating scandal at Duke last year and most American universities announced that they are closing their branches in China due to RAMPANT CHEATING. Perhaps this also explains why our econ is such a mess: Asians who got good grades but cheated their way through school have now taken all our jobs but are unable to do them since they never really acquired the education needed - they just want to fake it and get the $, even if it means collapsing the companies.</p>
<p>Funny, but in 1998 when we dumb whites were running everything the U.S. econ was experiencing its biggest boom in history.</p>
<p>The Asian mystique is a huge myth. Name one new industry or product of any significance to come out of Asia.</p>
<p>All their &#8220;booming&#8221; industries came from white America. A decade of flooding America with H-1B guest workers has allowed them to come here and get trained for free, then return home and compete against us while at the same time discouraging our kids to go into tech fields.</p>
<p>WAKE UP AMERICA, YOU HAVE BEEN INVADED.</p>

		<p>Off her topic in the Wall Street Journal, but Amy Chua is noted for warning of risks of mixing economic liberty with democracy in a multi-ethnic society and for the concept of &#8220;market-dominant minorities&#8221;:</p>
<p>Highlights of &#8220;On the Dark Side of Democracy,&#8221; January 31, 2004, New York Times, By EMILY EAKIN<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/6g7mzbg" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/6g7mzbg</a></p>
<p> <br>
AMY CHUA ON THE ANGER, DISCRIMINATION AND EVEN GENOCIDAL VIOLENCE THAT CAN RESULT FROM MIXING FREE-MARKETS AND DEMOCRACY:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To most Americans, the notion that free markets and democracy are essential to curing the world&rsquo;s ills is an article of faith &hellip; All too often, she says, bringing free markets and elections to developing nations leads not to stability or prosperity but to hate-mongering, discrimination and even genocidal violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>WHY AMERICANS ARE NAIVE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LIBERTY TO TRIGGER ATROCITY: WE ARE BLIND TO ETHNIC DIFFERENCES, TO THE EXISTENCE OF WHAT SHE CALLS &ldquo;MARKET-DOMINANT MINORITIES&rdquo;: Ms. Chua: </p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s kind of a taboo topic in the West.&#8221; </p>
<p>America &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t like to talk about ethnic conflict: despite a long history of racial problems, assimilation is part of the national creed. But in much of the developing world, she argues, nations are starkly divided along ethnic lines. Disproportionately wealthy ethnic minorities  &mdash;  &mdash;  Ms. Chua calls them market-dominant minorities  &mdash;  &mdash;  exist alongside poor and resentful majorities. And in such cases, she insists, adding democracy and free markets can be disastrous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IN FREE MARKET DEMOCRACIES, MARKET-DOMINANT MINORITIES ACQUIRE GREAT WEALTH IN FREE MARKETS,  IMPOVERISHED MAJORITIES ACQUIRE POLITICAL POWER: RESULT: POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC ETHNO-NATIONALISM:</p>
<p>This &ldquo;is precisely what is happening today in Indonesia, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Russia and the Middle East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TEXTBOOK CASE: THE PHILLIPPINES: &ldquo;A Chinese-American whose family is from the Philippines, Ms. Chua says she has seen firsthand the destructive effects of free markets and democracy. Both arrived in the Philippines after its independence from the United States in 1946, benefiting the tiny, entrepreneurial Chinese community at the expense of the Filipino majority. Though they make up barely 1 percent of the population, she writes, &lsquo;Chinese Filipinos control as much as 60 percent of the private economy, including the country&rsquo;s four major airlines and almost all of the country&rsquo;s banks, hotels, shopping malls and major conglomerates.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>MS. CHUA&rsquo;S CENTRAL RECOMMENDATION: LET&rsquo;S SUPPORT A PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF DEMOCRACY AND FREE MARKETS–NOT A ROSE-COLORED GLASSES VERSION:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the last 20 years, we have done things in many ways so badly, so foolishly, often with the best of intentions  &mdash;  &mdash;  like dropping a stock exchange in Mozambique or xeroxing copies of the U.S. Constitution. I think we can do better.&rsquo; In her book, she argues that one way to reduce inequality and ethnic tension in democratizing nations is for market-dominant minorities to share some of their wealth by making &lsquo;significant, visible contributions to the local economies in which they are thriving,&rsquo; by which she means building universities, hospitals or recreational facilities, supporting local schools and employing members of the indigenous majority in their companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>In an earlier piece in the New York Times, Chua described the Venezuelan variation of this process, in which whites are the market-dominant minority and Amerindians (Pardos) are the impoverished majority.  Highlight from: POWER TO THE PRIVILEGED, By AMY CHUA, New York Times, Jan. 7, 2003: <br>

&ldquo;In 1998, Mr. Chavez swept to electoral victory by attacking Venezuela&rsquo;s &lsquo;rotten&rsquo; white elites, calling himself &lsquo;the Indian from Barinas&rsquo; and arousing into impassioned political consciousness Venezuela&rsquo;s impoverished pardos.  After taking power, Mr. Chavez disbanded the &lsquo;worm-eaten&#8221;&rsquo; mantuano-dominated Congress and Supreme Court. He suspended privatization, vowed to dismantle Venezuela&rsquo;s plantation system, and decreed scores of laws intended to soften what he called &lsquo;savage capitalism.&rsquo; Predictably, all this had a devastating effect on Venezuela&rsquo;s economy.&rdquo;</p>

How many millions of White earned dollars have been wasted in Haiti since the earthquake?</p>

		<p>One wonders, if Chinese parents and mothers in particular, are so successful and wonderful, how was it millions of little Maoists with their little red books terrorized China, reporting parents, destroying everything Western or musical, bullied old people, and gleefully engaged in murder of relatives and even their own parents?  What went wrong?  How is it these inherently wonderful mothers allow the &#8220;one child&#8221; rule to continue and not rise up in their billions against it, but rather allow female children to be sold, abandoned, and left do die?  Oh, right.  In China they do those things.  Here in the Western culture they despise as too permissive, they thrive.</p>

		<p>Haha, let&rsquo;s not forget that &#8216;African American&rsquo; students have for decades scored highest on tests that supposedly measure self-esteem. Meanwhile, they get the lowest grades and are also most likely to end up as drug addicts, violent felons and prostitutes. Tye reason, of course, is simple: psychology and sociology are pseudo-sciences. When they claim to measure self-esteem they&rsquo;re really just measuring the kind of braggadocio engendered by Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s &#8220;I am somebody&#8221; initiative from decades ago - plus the just outright egotism that rap teaches.</p>
<p>The story of Marcy who cried upon hearing that a child was ostracized for being disrespectful? That reminds me of the white woman who broke down and cried uncontrollably at the OJ trial when she testified about the incident years and years previously in which she&rsquo;d heard Det. Mark Furman use a *bad word* in reference to blacks. We&rsquo;ll possibly see Marcy&rsquo;s kids first on &#8216;SuperNanny&rsquo; and then eventually on &#8216;America&rsquo;s Most Wanted&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>A few of us white people don&rsquo;t even <i>have</i> TVs.  But I have to say Chua&rsquo;s description sounds extreme:</p>
<p><i>Here are some things my daughters, Sophia and Louisa, were never allowed to do:</i><br>
&hellip;<br>
<i>* play any instrument other than the piano or violin</i></p>
<p><i>* not play the piano or violin.</i></p>
<p>What if the kid prefers the cello instead?  Like <a href="http://www.yo-yoma.com/" rel="nofollow">Yo-yo Ma</a>?</p>
<p>I also fail to see what&rsquo;s so terribly wrong with being in a school play.</p>
<p>While Chua and other Chinese parents may lean too much in the direction of being control freaks there is little doubt in my mind that most white parents today do far too little to demand excellence from their children.  After all, if they did, the black-white performance gap would get even worse.  If that happens whitey will get blamed, and will certainly be required to fund whatever new dysfunctional programs are designed to ameliorate the situation.</p>

		<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>I believe it is very important for everyone to visit the link to the original article.  It appears that her two daughters are not full Chinese; therefore, I would immediately question why this Chinese mother would essentially impugn Western culture   &mdash;   in that way, I believe she is being rather hypocritical.</p>
<p>Also worth reading are the comments for the original article.  Many, if not most, of those commentators felt that this Chinese mother&rsquo;s behavior is not exemplary.</p>
<p>I find that her behavior is actually quite disgusting.  I feel very sorry for her husband, Jed, whom I strongly believe is Caucasian, and her two mixed daughters, Louisa and Sophia.</p>
<p>Try Googling the following search string:[ asian women mental illness ]</p>
<p>You will find a plethora of information that may explain this very odd behavior of this Chinese mother.</p>
<p>Her list of forbidden activities is draconian (even for a daughter):</p>
<p>* attend a sleepover</p>
<p>In my past, I have spent the night at many of friends&rsquo; homes.  It was always fun.  There are so many things to do such as watch TV, listen to records, play games, even do homework.</p>
<p>* have a playdate</p>
<p>Does she mean with the opposite sex?  If she does, then I agree that some supervision is in order, but I would not completely outlaw it.</p>
<p>* be in a school play</p>
<p>I was once the lead of our school play; it was a very educational experience because the lead player will eventually need to memorize the whole script and coach the other players.</p>
<p>* complain about not being in a school play</p>
<p>Kids want to be with other schools kids; that is normal.  Notice how that above forbidden activity is worded: &#8220;complain about&hellip;&#8221; versus &#8220;not being in a school play.&#8221;  For this Chinese mother, it is not punishment enough to be forbidden to participate in a school play.  Should her child __complain__ about not being in a school play, then what?  More severe punishment?</p>
<p>* watch TV or play computer games</p>
<p>TV and computer games can be very educational.  It is a matter of choice of programs to watch and programs to play.</p>
<p>* choose their own extracurricular activities</p>
<p>I thought the whole point of an extracurricular activity was to have the freedom to choose a fun activity to do.</p>
<p>* get any grade less than an A<br>
* not be the No. 1 student in every subject except gym and drama</p>
<p>Granted: everyone should try his/her very best, but not everyone is going to get that A.  My main concern is the abuse this Chinese mother will heap on her daughters, should one or both of them not get an A grade in a particular subject.</p>
<p>So, there are exceptions for gym and drama!  How very hypocritical of this Chinese mother!  On one hand, the daughters are given a pass for not getting an A in gym; on the other hand, the daughters are told, &#8220;Hey fatty   &mdash;   lose some weight!&#8221;</p>
<p>* play any instrument other than the piano or violin<br>
* not play the piano or violin.</p>
<p>Why play at all?  If they cannot be in a play, why should they be in a recital?</p>
<p>This Chinese mother has some very serious mental health issues (in my opinion).  She seems to be projecting her own inadequacies onto her own daughters.  Worse yet, this Chinese mother is doing all this psychological conditioning (brainwashing) in the hopes of getting paid back at some later time.  In effect, she hopes to  ensure her retirement though future payments from her daughters.</p>
<p>That is a very third-world view.</p>
<p>This article serves well as a warning to all those who even contemplate marrying a Chinese woman.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>

		<p>This article is clearly written by an Asian with an Asian cultural bias. Chalking up disparities between Western children and Chinese children (and also Jamaican children apparently LOL I have to laugh) to parental attitudes is a very simplistic analysis and so is so far off based it shouldn&rsquo;t have even been considered for an entry in a such a prestigious magazine as the WSJ. (come on, really, when has anyone witnessed Jamaican Children vying for #1 in any academic feats?)</p>
<p>Individuals such as Steven Pinker, professor of Harvard, have noted that parents actually leave very little outward effect on their children once they leave the confines and boundaries of their households. Experts say that parents leave anywhere from 0%-10% effect on a child&rsquo;s behaviour once he/she reaches adulthood. Twin Studies continually demonstrate that genes account for atleast 50% of an individuals behaviour and that the other 40-50% come from the surrounding culture (ie the culture of one&rsquo;s nation and peers). </p>
<p>She cites studies that only link correlation but not causation. For example, a parent that reads a lot tends to have kids that also read a lot. It is wrong to assume the kid reads a lot simply because the parent taught that particular value system to the kid. Another viable explanation is that children share same the genes as the parents, and therefore the habit of reading is something that comes natural to the kids as does the parents. This is why twin studies are required: to tease apart genes and parenting. Genes have been shown to trump parenting in every case.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s ideas are hardly scientifically rigourous and clearly come from a cultural lense that suggests behaviours and habits are a direct result of parenting. Such a belief couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. I&rsquo;m bit confused as to why Amren would even consider posting this article. It&rsquo;s well beneath them.</p>

		<p>I think Amy Chua just called me a &#8220;chinese mother&#8221;. But seriously, that pretty much fits my psychology as well. Allow me to brag a little. My oldest brought home his standardized test scores a few weeks ago. He was in the 99th percentile in every category. And it said he was reading at the 9th grade level. He took the tests at the end of 3rd grade. He&rsquo;s a little behind where I was at his age. But with enough hard work I think he&rsquo;ll be alright.</p>

		<p>This is why I am often a tad skeptical when I hear that much of these achievement stats and the like have to do with the superior IQ of Asians. It&rsquo;s like running an obstacle course, and putting a trained marine who&rsquo;s been through boot camp and done it 1000 times and could do it in their sleep up against a lazy couch potato. When I was at school, the white kids where increasingly that couch potato, despite not being inherently stupid or lacking in potential. But they by and large didn&rsquo;t have a chance against the Asians. Those white kids whose parents still took education seriously, though, excelled, and equalled or bested their Asian counterparts, having to their advantage less of the automaton mindset brought about by the rote learning techniques favoured by the Asians.</p>
<p>Indeed it&rsquo;s we whites who have dropped our standards, much less so than a superior Asian IQ which suddenly somehow makes more of a difference than it did in the past.</p>

		<p>I used to live in Cupertino (the home of Apple Corp) in the mid 90&rsquo;s. The city was completely dominated by the Chinese, including the school board.</p>
<p>It appeared as though they wanted to do a one-up on everyone else, including whites, East Indians and other immigrants.</p>
<p>Not just in education, but in terms of even fashion and showing off that their general behavior was all too predictable.</p>
<p>Rich college kids would invariably own Acuras (notably the 3.2 TL) or BMW coupes. They considered owning any American car beneath their dignity. Teenage and college girls would like to hang out at J C Penney&rsquo;s with the more snobbish ones doing their shopping at Neiman Marcus or Bloomingdales in nearby Palo Alto.</p>
<p>And the women would all be dressed in black evening wear most of the times, it was almost like their uniform.</p>
<p>One good thing about them is, despite their talk of integrating into the mainstream and being model immigrants, they were race realists who really looked down upon anyone of their kind interacting with a black of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>The school district had very few, if any, blacks. Of course, the richer Chinese would send their kids to Challenger schools, which was more of a statement by them regarding their affluence.</p>
<p>And finally, as mentioned in the article, piano/violin lessons were compulsory for the girls.</p>

		<p>Electrical Engineer: A playdate is where 2 or more mothers get together at a specified time and place for their usually pre-school age children to play together, or attend some activity so as to have appropriate and parent-supervised social interaction with other children of the same age. This allows the mothers to socialize at the same time, and to ensure their children are associating with the &#8220;right kind&#8221; of families from birth.

		<p>I agree wholly with #1 Father of Three.  This article is food for thought, and I do believe that Western parents need to expect more of their children.  When we begin home schooling, I fully intend to push my children hard and to teach them to respect their parents and themselves.  </p>
<p>That said, I also want to engage other parts of my children&rsquo;s faculties than rote memorization.  I want to force them to <i>think</i>, not just repeat back the answers that I want to hear.  I believe that White children will benefit more from the Platonic method   &mdash;   questioning them until they come up with the answers themselves   &mdash;   than from just telling them &#8220;this is so.&#8221;  In this way, I hope to foster in them the Western ingenuity and critical thinking skills that have benefited our race in the past.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this extreme authoritarianism is really fit for most white parents. Though the fact that so many whites have taken it to the mushy, permissive extreme does make it resonate to some extent with those sick of the little slackers were forced to put up with these days. Stuff like being a Piano or Violin virtuoso are such farces. Many people lack the muscle dexterity to play those difficult instruments no matter how hard they try, there is nothing wrong with playing the trumpet or clarinet. A better rule would be &#8220;anything BUT the electric guitar and drums&#8221; as a parents motive should not be as much about the instrument per se but the culture of delinquency surrounding certain musical genres. Her whole, the children owe the parents fails to be honest about the real cultural roots of that. Asian parents leech of their children and use them as ATM&rsquo;s in a manner that most whites would be disgusted about if they knew about them. (Whites don&rsquo;t even understand Asian motivations, when they accuse those mail order brides of &#8220;just wanting a green card&#8221; they are so wrong and making white assumptions of individuality. The real motive of asian peasant girls is to get hold of the man&rsquo;s money and transfer it all back to her extended clan. I saw a movie on PBS called &#8220;Daughter from Danang&#8221; where an Amerasian baby evacuated during the fall of South Vietnam in 1975 and raised by whites in Tennessee sought out her birth mother. It was absolutely disgusting the way the whole clan immediately descended upon her practically from the moment she stepped off the plane trying to hustle her for money, demanding permanent financial support from a woman trying to heal emotional ills. The poor Amerasian girl freaked out on camera when the hustle got too intense and caught the first flight back home. Liberal whites on the internet condemned her &#8220;selfishness&#8221; yet I can only imagine their reaction if the situation were reversed and she was reuniting with long lost relatives in Tennessee and was immediately set upon with cold demands for money. I believe the posts would go something along the line about &#8220;greedy rednecks.&#8221;)</p>

		<p>Studies show that Asians adopted by white families do well in school, because they have the same level of support by their white adoptive parents as other Asians do with their biological parents.</p>
<p>The scant few Asians that are either part of a black family or those who have a tendency to adhere and identify with the black community, because they live near/within black areas do worse than whites no matter what their family histories are.  They do better than their black peers, however.</p>
<p>Murry/Hernstein&rsquo;s 3 point difference in Asian/white I.Q. isn&rsquo;t enough of a difference to really matter in the overall scheme of things.</p>
<p>White success has been so phenomenally greater than Asians many researchers are getting into facets of group traits and abilities to account for that.  White success is no mistake and is a far greater measure of ability and intelligence than I.Q. tests. Although I.Q. tests are accurate, and should be given considerable weight, they don&rsquo;t tell the whole story.</p>

		<p>Interesting and provocative piece by Ms. Chua.  East Asians, and particularly Northeast Asians, are generally smart people, with average IQs slightly higher than those of Caucasians.  But her examples of discipline and parental insistence on maximum effort from her kids is not a uniquely Asian trait.  We have a group of whites in our midst with a very similar work ethic and who are similarly successful.  We call them Jews, and it&rsquo;s no accident or matter of luck that they&rsquo;re hugely and disproportionately represented in the professions, the sciences, the arts, and in all fields in which intellect, focus, and sheer hard work are required.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, the Chinese are widely regarded as &#8220;the Jews of Asia.&#8221;</p>

I say that because I have a Chinese man (US born and raised) as my wife&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband (since my wife and her sister were adopted, I will not call him an in-law), who is the laziness and dumbest man I have ever met.  He spends all his time making excuses for why he can&rsquo;t work.  This has gone on for like, 25 years.  The kids are a little better, but not much.  They all ride on the back of the hard working white woman in the family whose health is fading.</p>
<p>Chinese and other linguistic groups that have characters that must be memorized by rote, have a tendency to have better capacities for memory.  But they do not lend themselves to creativity.  This is reflected in the Chinese and Asian economies in general, that copy rather than create.  As for ethics, gambling and cheating is not a bit above a Chinese.  In fact, gambling addiction among Chinese and Asians is a real problem.  Absolute discipline that would smother a Western mind is what the Chinese and Asian needs in order to succeed and conquer.  The tendency and practice the article extols really comes from the period of communist China when discipline and hard work was harsh and absolutism ruled.</p>

		<p>Is this woman telling us that China doesn&rsquo;t have many Chinese mothers? Like many have said before: If you and your Chinese  people and culture  are so superior to us European Americans( are there any other genuine kind?) why do so many of yours come to live in our society and so few of ours come to yours?</p>

		<p>&gt;be in a school play<br>
I can see this.  I wasn&rsquo;t in HS theatre, but was in college theatre (orchestra pit).  Although acting does involve concentration and hard work, there is a kind of silly-fun, go-out-and-party atmosphere which might not be best for a child developing hardcore academic focus.  Actors also rehearse several nights per week, much of that idle time waiting for one&rsquo;s entrances or waiting out scenes one doesn&rsquo;t appear in. </p>
<p>If she asked to audition on violin for pit, though, the mom should understand this as contributing to her daughter&rsquo;s musical development.  </p>
<p>&gt;play any instrument other than the piano or violin<br>
You tell me just what is so inferior about oboe or bassoon.  I think it may be because piano and violin have more range and more potential for speed, so they *appear* more virtuosic.  What happened to the Zen appreciation of subtleties of tone attack and timbre?  </p>
<p>Or:  piano and violin aren&rsquo;t useful in marching band, so, one more layer of protection against silly-behavior pressures.  I had a hard time seeing this because I associate most wind instruments with the symphony, not the band.  Solution:  community chamber-music club for kids (it&rsquo;s not just strings any more:  there are a lot of neat chamber pieces that use brass, woodwind and percussion).  <br>

Wow, what a racist article! What if the headline had said &ldquo;White mothers superior&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&#8221; What the article doesn&rsquo;t tell you is that Asians have the highest cheating rates in U.S. colleges. There was a huge Asian cheating scandal at Duke last year and most American universities announced that they are closing their branches in China due to RAMPANT CHEATING. Perhaps this also explains why our econ is such a mess: Asians who got good grades but cheated their way through school have now taken all our jobs but are unable to do them since they never really acquired the education needed - they just want to fake it and get the $, even if it means collapsing the companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>You sure got that right.  Because I am White I can never be anything more than a lowly clerk at a major California University.  Only reason I even have the job is because I checked the black instead of the White box on my application.</p>
<p>One thing every college professor or instructor can tell you about is the foreign students who allegedly passed the TOEFL (test of english as a foreign language) exam before being accepted in an American university who neither speaks nor understands a word of English because they simply paid someone else to take the exam for them.</p>
<p>I make about $20,000 per year writing term papers and even Master&rsquo;s thesis for Asian students at my and several other very prestigious California Universities. They think no more of buying a term paper than an American would think of hiring someone to paint their house rather than do it themselves.</p>
<p>Why do I do it?  I have to pay rent, food, transport to my low paid job. As a White American I am under the affirmative action discrimination ban.  I have no desire to be homeless.  I could not afford transport to work if I did not supplement my income with writing term papers for money.  That is why I do it and I am grateful for the opportunity. </p>
<p>Another scam the Asians pull is hiring people to take classes for them.  Some Asians graduate in just 3 years because they will take summer school at their own college and hire someone else to take a class at a community college and then transfer the credits.  A student can take 12 units at their own college per semester and hire 2 people to take 6 units at a community college under their name and accumulate 18 credits a semester thus graduating in only 3 years and of course being accepted into grad school because of affirmative action.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I have been asked to take the GRE and other exams for pay for an Asian student.  About once a decade a college instructor will notice that the same person has taken a class for the last 3 years under different names.</p>
<p>The colleges refuse to address Asian cheating because it conflicts with their Orwellian &#8220;Whites bad all others good&#8221; mantra.</p>
<p>Watch out for the medical professions.  Many of the immigrant personnel are using the authentic credentials of friends and relatives.  Or they will rent an authentic credential, Dr. license and social security card when applying for a job.  The administrators of nursing homes, hospitals, therapy clinics etc are fully aware of this scam but go along with it because they belong to the same corrupt, dishonest ethnic groups as the people they hire.</p>

		<p>I agree with the sentiments of many of the posters here, that Asians should be living in Asian societies if they think their way is so superior to whitey.</p>
<p>The theory of multiple intelligences is intruiging for someone like myself who has spent a lot of time living abroad. I wouldn&rsquo;t dispute that Asians as a group just might be superior to whites in the realm of rational/analytical intelligence, i.e. the traditional measure of mathematical and scientific reasoning. Blacks seem inferior as a group in just about every measure, save the one that covers physical coordination and manipulation of objects in the immediate environment. Latinos just baffle me; how can people who barely comprehend simple arithmetic be the descendants of the designers of the Mayan Calendar?!</p>
<p>Most interestingly, though, no Asian society has ever spawned democracy or representative government spontaneously. Asians as a group seem to have an anti-democracy gene, and for whatever reason a sense that anything that&rsquo;s enjoyable or fun should probably be avoided. Left to their own devices, they tend to create well-organized authoritarian societies full of people who are scared to death of each other or of standing out in any way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my personal observation that whites seem the best balanced of peoples as far as keeping things in perspective and striking a balance between personal freedom and public order. Creativity in the sciences and in engineering always begins in white societies. An Asian society on its own is like a person paralyzed with inhibitions, standing around with his thumb in an orifice waiting for someone else to show him what to do.</p>
<p>If Asians excel here, it&rsquo;s because they are able to use their innate abilities to utilize the advantages of living in the kinds of societies that white people create. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if they&rsquo;d leave us alone and let us have our own society, with the pleasant balance of serious effort and enjoyment of life that only white people seem able to engender?</p>

		<p>#31:  <i>Purely on average, Anglo-Saxon women make the worst White mothers bc they are too verbal and generally cuddle their children less.</i></p>
<p>As for your snarky slur on Anglo-Saxon mothers:</p>
<p>Funny how we Anglo-Saxon women produced children who created, invented and developed 90% of the technology and the First World Civilization that rest of the world enjoys today.</p>
<p>Why do you think it is that Asians, Hispanics and blacks from every corner of the world risk their lives and fall all over each other to join a civilization built by us (and only us) Anglo-Saxons?</p>
<p>Our people put a man on the moon, discovered medical breakthroughs, cleaned up the water supply and separated it from sewage.  We produced vaccines, discovered germ theory and developed antibiotics.  We discovered and implemented Natural Laws, the (soon to be disappeared) Rule of Law and Free Markets.  We developed the jet engine!  And Computers!  And Electricity! And Televisions! And The Internal Combustion Engine! </p>
<p>And, oh yeah, the United States of America.  We Anglo-Saxons created that too. </p>
<p>But no one gives us credit for these wondrous things&hellip;instead, the government and media choose to debase and mock us, call our creation a &#8220;proposition&#8221; nation built by and on the backs of blacks and other non-Whites.  But nothing could be further from the truth!</p>
<p>Because of us Anglo-Saxon women, the culture we created and the progeny we produced, life for everyone has improved.</p>
<p>Seems like we Anglo-Saxon mothers (NOT Asian, black or Hispanic)  did something right, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the world should be <b>thanking us</b> for our creativity, generosity and discoveries, for the orderly culture we created rather than tearing us down at every opportunity and wishing our demise</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t worry.  We&rsquo;ll be gone soon, our numbers already diminishing; we are not reproducing and we&rsquo;ll be eliminated when our population is small enough   &mdash;    set upon by jealous non-Whites who are being primed for this purpose by their masters.  Enough Asians have been imported by now to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>No one will ever again have to worry about us COLD, heartless Anglo-Saxons mothers because by that time the world will have descended into anarchy or tyranny, not the utopia the lefties keep promising.  The Rule of Law will be long forgotten, to the detriment of everyone; after that, there are only two systems left:  Tyranny or Anarchy.  Something you&rsquo;ll find in the darkest, most primitive, backwards, war torn corners of the earth.  </p>
<p>Which would you choose, anarchy or tyranny?  Yes, we (A-HEM) &#8220;verbal&#8221; Anglo-Saxon mothers did indeed do something right!</p>
<p>Bravo and chin chin for Anglo-Saxon mothers!</p>
<p>You will miss us when we&rsquo;re gone.</p>

		<p>Every white person should copy &#8220;From the Belly of the Affirmative Action Beast&rsquo;s&#8221; post.  It is must have information.  East Asians have no qualms cheating the system as long as they get ahead.  Fake it until you make it is what East Asians live by.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention in my previous post (#10) how non-white people in relationships with white people insist on the offspring be raised as non-white.  Non-white parents are the leaders, no matter their gender, in the relationship, they set the path the family goes on and the white person goes along with it.</p>
<p>John, white people have higher IQs than East Asians.  IQ scores are calibrated so the verbal sections are not given their full weight.</p>

		<p>I think that it might be more accurate to title the article &#8220;Why Chinese Mothers are Inferior.&#8221;  The author has just listed all the ways by which parents of this persuasion put their children in emotional strait jackets and set them up for a life of dreary conformity in pursuit of the things that ultimately will not make them happy.  It is true that some Chinese kids do become math prodigies in the process (or &#8220;one instrument&#8221; musical prodigies) but do they become well-rounded, emotionally flexible human beings?  It must also be kept in mind that the majority of children raised under this regimen do not become the proverbial math or musical prodigies.  The majority end up in some sort of career like all of us, but are they warm human beings capable of the net-working that is required to advance in such careers?  My impression is that there is a certain coldness to the Asian success culture, as it mimics the American success culture, with its emphasis on expensive cars and other material signs that one has &#8220;made it.&#8221;  They may have made it on one level, but the emotional hollowness is sometimes palpable.</p>
<p>I am a Caucasian father, married to an Chinese lady from China  &mdash;  who may have become a &#8220;Chinese mother&#8221; were it not for my opposing influence.  Ironically, my daughter found her vocational &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; in drama, beginning with her participation in a high school musical in grade 9.  She is now studying theatre at the university level.  Would I have been a good parent had I denied her participation in high school drama  &mdash;  which, by the way, made high school a joy for her, as well as for her parents (as they participated as audience.)?  Clearly not.  I am sure my wife&rsquo;s Chinese relatives are scandalized by my daughter&rsquo;s choice of vocation, but it appears that their treatment of their daughters comes close to being child abuse.  They practice very strictly the Chinese parents&rsquo; guidelines listed above, but their daughters are, so far, not No. 1 students and, they are only surviving emotionally and socially due to the amazing ability of the young to adapt and to rise above oppressive circumstances.  My wife, herself a survivor of the Cultural Revolution in China, is an example of this.  But they survive and prosper despite the oppression and not because of it.  </p>
<p>One need only look at the intellectual and artistic accomplishments of China, in comparison to those of the West, to see how this sort of parenting regime only fosters successful conformity  &mdash;  not innovation or emotional happiness.  Remember-the Chinese prodigies are doing math and playing music developed in the West&hellip;</p>

<p><br>
Happy adults who will be working for those engineers and automatons, paying rent to them, taking orders from them, being governed by them, operated on by them&hellip;  Et cetera, et cetera.<br>

Ah yes, such sweet happiness! Ignorance is bliss. </p>
<p>But at least they had fun in their childhood.</p>
<p>In life you can&rsquo;t have everything. Sometimes it&rsquo;s either/or.</p>
<p>People usually get what they choose. You have chosen childhood fun. The Chinese have chosen adult success.</p>
<p>[Postscript: Does that choice not in itself reveal a difference in intelligence?]</p>

<p><br>
In that case, I have mixed feelings. I am all for rigorous instruction and for music lessons (in all instruments). Music teaches logic and discipline; it is really a form of mathematics, and the Greeks regarded it that way.</p>
<p>But if it is restricted solely to the girls (which only you have said), then I am less enthusiastic for the idea, because it carries the implication that culture is somehow effeminate and not something that something that &#8220;real men&#8221; ought to be bothered with. Culture is a girl&rsquo;s thing! And that insidious notion is part of our American problem today, where the rich classical culture of our people is being lost because it is thought to be beneath men, and only for old ladies. (That is not the European tradition btw; it is the American attitude.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while we are losing our historical culture,  the Chinese (and other Asians) are gaining it!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like them seeing their foolish neighbors throwing priceless antiques out on the trash heap. So they go out and rescue the antiques and refurbish them!  Now, the valuable antiques are theirs.  Who is showing the greater intelligence?  Or call it just &#8220;common sense&#8221;, if you will. </p>

		<p>There are a lot of posts causing me to roll my eyes in this thread. Asians will dominate not because they do better in school or because they have a tiny advantage in this or that. </p>
<p>They will dominate simply because they are more pragmatic than whites. When the japanese found out how badly they were behind the western world in 1852 when Admiral Perry showed up in an iron age Japan with his huge black ships they did a total turnaround from total isolaationism to frantic catch upping.</p>
<p>The chinese used to be communists until they found out that it doesnt really work. Deng Xiaopong declared that it does not matter which color the cat has as long as it catches rats. He was pragmatic and not religio-ideologically driven like a white person. China did a total turnaround. </p>
<p>Now the chinese are running some kind of fascist capitalism instead with great sucesss. Such turnarounds are not possible in white nations because most whites are not mentally dexterous enough to abandon something they believe in even if its shown beyond doubt that it doesnt work. They have a fundamentally religious approach to reality. </p>
<p>Just look at all the white people who move away from the diversity when it moves in among them and then go around in their newly moved into whiteytopias and complain about the lack of diversity. Just look at all the millions of whites who believe in an economic system where work does not pay despite its spectacular failure in the Soviet union. Just look at the millions of whites who believe in free trade despite free trade making them and their nation destitute. They claim its because there wasnt enough free trade! Just look at the millions of whites who believe in the magical markets, which will magically work at 101% effience forever instead of turning into oligopolies as business quickly consolidate. </p>
<p>There is simply something fundamentally important lacking in the brains of most white people, something which is present in most asian minds. The only way a white nation can work is if these crippled whites are kept far away from the reins of power. Can you draw the logical conclusion about the prevailing politicial system in white nations from this set of premises? </p>
<p>By the way, the japanese eventually ended up declaring war on the USA 89 years after they were pried open by Admiral Perry (on behalf of a bunch of greedy american businessmen), primarily because the USA didnt want to allow the emergence of a competing power in the western Pacific. Now the many times larger chinese nation is doing the same journey because of an american president acting on behalf of bunch of greedy americans. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how they can see only what they want and overlook what they don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>To understand that mentality, we  must realize that they DO NOT  see  the USA, western civ,  and all these other things as  having been created by us. Oh, no!  These things do not come from us, they are simply facts of nature.  They think we just came along and stumbled upon this rich, productive country and grabbed it,  greedily keeping it for ourselves and refusing to share it with them. In other words, it is ours only because we stole it.  And what human improvement has been added  has been built upon their backs with their sweat and toil.   Thus,  it was they  (in hand with Nature) who created this rich country and all that is in it.  By rights, it should belong to them!  Whitey, you greedy thief, they  only want what&rsquo;s theirs!   That contorted  point of view suits them very nicely. They are the wronged and we are the aggressors. Simple.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about and you do not understand that there is a war going on, a War on Whites, right here in the United States, engineered and controlled by a hostile elite whose agenda is to wipe us off the face of the earth.  Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>We Whites were doing just fine before the 1965 immigration law opened our borders and country wide open to non-Whites.</p>
<p>At the same time, a new, hostile government, academia and media took complete hold and started an aggressive campaign against us Whites, triangulated against us, put their boots on our necks and hold us down to this day, locking us out of college admissions, promotions and careers, implementing policies that seize our wealth and leave us destitute.</p>
<p>Why do you think it is that all other ethnic/racial groups are allowed to form advocacy groups <i>except for Whites</i>  This includes Asians who are forming pro-Asian political groups to advocate and promote for their own people.  </p>

<p>A recent NYT opinion article  &mdash;  amazingly, on Hollywood  &mdash;  mentioned as an aside that what&rsquo;s really needed for creativity is solid mastery of 2 different knowledge fields.  If one works at both intensely enough, one&rsquo;s brain will attempt to merge them and thus generate original idea connections.  This is the next step above Ms. Chua&rsquo;s claim that hard work and complete confident mastery of at least one field leads to a deeper sort of happiness. </p>
<p>Since hippie days, there has been an American myth that knowledge interferes with creativity (ask any 1970&rsquo;s or &#8216;80&rsquo;s MIT grad  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s a big part of why they didn&rsquo;t work as hard as today&rsquo;s MIT students).  Looks like we need some myth-smashing research on where real, seriously-innovative creativity (i.e., new science, new medicine, new technology, new managerial concepts, NOT rock lyrics!) comes from. </p>

<p>I found your post fascinating. I guess because your wife seemed able to adjust and change her behavior from her culture to yours. It made me wonder if Chinese are close enough to us in temperament, etc. (of course I realize your wife represents just one point on a bell curve) that they could possibly be absorbed here with less difficulty than other races.* (But of course they may be the ones who end up doing the absorbing). </p>
<p>Arthur Jensen of course is the noted IQ researcher who was reviled here at Berkeley during his professorship for being a &#8220;racist,&#8221; for his results on differences in average black and white IQs. In an interview (sorry I don&rsquo;t have the citation) years ago with a white nationalist type, he said that what he cared about was the preservation of Western culture, or Western civilization (I don&rsquo;t recall his exact words), and he didn&rsquo;t care about who preserved it, Asians (maybe he said Chinese specifically) or Europeans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a remark that one forgets, when made by someone like him! Not much of a &#8220;racist&#8221; he turned out to be. But possibly, sadly, a realist. Time will tell.</p>
<p><br>
*In my ideal world, they would all disappear from our shores, and be replaced by the grown up white babies we didn&rsquo;t have. I&rsquo;ve met Americanized Chinese that I&rsquo;ve really liked, but just the alien physiognomy of their faces makes me feel that I can never be quite as close to them as to a white person. Strangely, they feel even more alien to me in that regard than blacks do, perhaps because I&rsquo;ve seen blacks all my life, and I really saw no Chinese until I was an adult.</p>

		<p>Bon, excellent post #46! Certainly much of science developed in Germany and France (and Galileo was Italian) as well as in England, but England&rsquo;s Anglo Saxons probably contributed more than any group, I&rsquo;d guess.</p>
<p>My impression from just a little reading is that, of the European races, German mothers were the &#8220;hardest.&#8221; Just an impression&hellip;..maybe others have actual knowledge.</p>
<p>I will give Chinese mothers credit for one very important thing. I imagine they would never consider allowing either their girl or boy children to be routinely sexually mutilated. So if they must be among us, I hope their presumed attitude about that may be of some influence.</p>

		<p>I work with several Chinese women.  I also have dated several young Asian men.  The parents pushed them all to achieve and they did, although affirmative action had a lot to do with it.</p>
<p>Asian parents do not push their children to achieve for altruistic reasons.  They push their children for one reason and one reason only, to demand repayment from their children from college graduation to retirement.</p>
<p>Virtually every young and middle aged adult Asian I know is, I guess one would call it tithing to their parents.  And large amounts too.  The parent takes care of the kids until college graduation and then the children take care of the parents until they die.  22 years vs 45 years.</p>
<p>What makes it so bad nowdays is that most people take on huge student loans to pay for college.  Then they take on car loans and credit card debt for commuting, clothes and other work expenses.</p>
<p>But the Asian parents refuse to acknowledge the student loans and grants.  &#8220;It cost us $90,000 to send you to college and grad school, so pay us back.&#8221;  Actually, $70,000 of that is student loans, grants and credit card debt for those horrendously overpriced textbooks and other college expenses.</p>
<p>That is why Asian parents push so hard. 45 years of payback!</p>
<p>The only Asians who don&rsquo;t push and demand much of their income from their adult children are the Japanese Americans most of whom have been in America since 1880 or so and the California Chinese Americans descended from Chinese who began arriving in the 1830&rsquo;s as refugees from the civil war and then for the Gold Rush, railroads etc. 150 years in America had so effect.</p>
<p>Most of the Asians I know who tithe to their parents are really struggling.  They have to make their car and credit card payments late because the money goes to the parents first. Dental care for Grandma before dental care for themselves or their kids.</p>
<p>Then there are the children compelled to work in the restaurant, sweatshop or dry cleaners at all hours of the day and night and go to school during the day. The girls have the additional burden of being traditional submissive Asian women at home and go out and conquer the world as managers. engineers and accountants at work. The guys, especially the oldest sons have the additional burden of taking care of everybody in the extended family both here and back in Asia according to Asian tradition.  They are always under pressure to hire or house some brother in law&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s cousin.</p>

		<p>&#8220;People usually get what they choose. You have chosen childhood fun. The Chinese have chosen adult success.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve forgotten about affirmative action.  Merit, talent and skills have nothing to do with being hired for a job.  Our anti White racist government has decreed that virtually all jobs from dishwashers to MDs and engineers go to non Whites.</p>
<p>Asians benefit from affirmative action as much as blacks.</p>

		<p>Wow, so much to say. I like most of the comments above, and have enjoyed them.  And I agree. A violin or the piano?  Why not an instrument invented by the Chinese?  It is just like how the Chinese were bragging because they were finally the first nonwhite country to win the Olympics in 2008.  Well, why don&rsquo;t they invent their own sports and sporting events etc&hellip;.?</p>
<p>In any case, I would like to add on to what Bon is saying above. From time to time I am confused with the insults directed at Anglo Saxons in this movement. I am from the South which is very Anglo Saxon and Protestant, so I know a great deal about Anglo Saxon culture. I have noticed that this is the one white group that we are allowed to criticize in this movement but please forbid one of my own to ever criticize Italian Americans or Polish Americans. After doing so we would be accused of being closeminded and divisive (as has been done on here).</p>
<p>In any case, I don&rsquo;t agree with many generalizations that are made about us (Anglo Saxons). One poster says Anglo Saxon mothers don&rsquo;t cuddle their kids enough, but yet here in the South, white women appear to be more affectionate than any other group of white women in the country in many ways. I mean, there are nation-wide jokes made about Southern women in regards to this.</p>
<p>I have also seen comments on this website under past articles implying that Protestants are less patriarchal than Catholics or Orthodox Christians. This couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. Here in the South, in Southern Baptist culture, male cheauvinism (which I have no problem with) is more blatant than anywhere else in the country when examining white communities, save the Mormons in Utah who are also Protestant.</p>
<p>Other comments  under past articles have implied that Anglo Saxons are the least racially conscious.  Once again, please come to the South!<br>
Let&rsquo;s please be careful with generalizations.</p>

<p>best post ever in this thread.</p>
<p>If one were to look at the sordid history of mankind in a  nutshell, it all comes down to WINNING. And history is written by the victors&hellip;</p>
<p>No matter how you win even if it means cheating, stealing, killing, raping, you WIN. And losers are not happy with their current allotment&hellip;</p>
<p>For the past 300 years or so, whites, particularly western europeans, have been the dirty winners. Hence, the world divide between the haves and have-nots. It just so happens that the winners can be identified physically through race which obfuscates but does not change the underlying fact that it is about WINNING.</p>
<p>Now these &#8220;winners&#8221; are losing ground to the rest of the world. This is how white nationalism has come into existence. White nationalism is essentially a reaction to the uncomfortable gradual erosion of what western whites have acquired in these few centuries. Once western whites are stripped of their advantages/assets white nationalism will vaporize into thin air. Believe me.  White nationalists will say well we just want to be with other whites because we share racial/physical, cultural likeness blah blah blah. But us white nationalists, the world doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Over time people and cultures mix, change, evolve, develop whether we like it or not. White nationalism is just an excuse for people not wanting to LOSE what they have WON and all the attributes they associate   &mdash;   often erroneously   &mdash;   with WINNING. White nationalism is not a TRUTH; it&rsquo;s just an idealogy, a belief&hellip;.</p>
<p>In the end it&rsquo;s not about race it&rsquo;s about WINNING.</p>
<p>And yes, from the wise words of Deng Xiopeng and I quote anon 52:</p>
<p>It does not matter which color the cat has as long as it catches rats</p>

<p>And how ironic that the race commonly considered to have suffered the most grievous loss in the last century was actually that century&rsquo;s greatest winner (not that its losses weren&rsquo;t real also).</p>
<p>That race has made its losses seem to be solely due to race, and has made its winnings seem to be not connected to race at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many whites entertain the oddly matched delusions that whites still stand in the winner&rsquo;s circle, and that the qualities bequeathed them by being white have had nothing to do with their getting there.</p>

<p>I think we here can all agree that being strongly involved and motivating and pushing your children to do well is a good thing. But based on what this Dragon Lady claims   &mdash;   assuming she&rsquo;s not exaggerating for literary or comic effect   &mdash;   I think most whites would also agree that Chinese mothers take these things TOO FAR. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to give Asians their due in the parenthood department: whatever their methods, they mostly turn out a quality product. I wish white parents hadn&rsquo;t gone so soft starting back in (of course) the 1960s or we&rsquo;d still be turning out better quality kids and adults too. Hippie parenting has been very damaging to the West. </p>
<p>But when I read the disciplinary and scholastic extremism of this author, her boasts and her generalizations don&rsquo;t convince me Chinese mothers are &#8220;superior&#8221;   &mdash;   only that they&rsquo;re more obnoxious. </p>

<p>Acquired and not earned.  Yes, I understand now, it&rsquo;s all becoming clear: everything we Whites have, whatever advantages and White Privileges we enjoy are because of what we&rsquo;ve magically &#8216;acquired.&rsquo;   </p>
<p>And, of course, we Whites don&rsquo;t have a right to anything we&rsquo;ve &#8216;acquired&rsquo;, right?</p>
<p>White nationalism is a reaction to a vicious PC Reign of Terror that is being enforced against Whites by the government.</p>
<p>White nationalism is a reaction to us Whites being stripped of our rights, of being stomped on by a hostile government that gives preferential treatment to non-qualified non-Whites over us.  </p>
<p>White nationalism is a reaction to a tyrannical  government that is systematically displacing us Whites by importing hoards of non-White, Third World, welfare parasites to further drain our economy and destroy the neighborhoods and cities that we built.</p>
<p>White nationalism is a reaction to a justice department that denies equality under the law when it comes to Whites, but not non-Whites.</p>
<p>White nationalism is a reaction to a media that portrays us as fools, goofballs, morons and idiots, helpless and floundering without the &#8216;wise&rsquo; guidance of non-Whites, a media that will not report vicious, black-on-White torture-murders yet accepts the word of a black prostitute and liar to convict White boys in the press, ruining their lives, without a scintilla of evidence, simply because they are White.</p>
<p>It is a reaction against  an academic culture that fills government K-college textbooks with portrayals of us Whites as evil and genocidal, worthy of nothing but elimination because of the (supposed) sins of our ancestors.  We are never given credit for the First World civilization we created.</p>
<p>We are sick of it, <b>sick of it!</b></p>
<p>But, thanks to the Internet, our savior, we are able to unshackle ourselves from the lying, White-hating mainstream media and fight back against this evil War that is being waged on our people.  In response, the government is calling for &#8216;limits&rsquo; to Free Speech, a return of the Fairness Doctrine, regulation of the Internet, more Hate Crimes bills that don&rsquo;t cover Whites and more gun control laws that prevent us from protecting ourselves against non-White predators who hunt us for fun, murder and profit.</p>
<p><i>Once western Whites are stripped of their advantages/assets white nationalism will vaporize into thin air.</i></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry:  This is exactly what the government,media and academia are doing, stripping us Whites of our wealth and property (our assets) to re-distribute to non-Whites, all in the name of Social Justice! </p>
<p>But, as we disappear, our assets stripped from us, and our numbers decimated, what will be left to re-distribute?  Margaret Thatcher pointed out that eventually you run out of other people&rsquo;s money.  This is happening right now in California, &#8220;other people&rsquo;s&#8221; money is running out.</p>
<p>White nationalism WILL vaporize into thin air because WE Whites will be vaporized into thin air if the government and media have their way.</p>

		<p>Poster #64 - it&rsquo;s interesting you bring up this concept of winning. A friend of mine in Asia worked for Intel. I forget what his role was, but he would travel around to their various offices to instruct staff, and keep an eye on things. In one staff meeting in China, he tried to pass on the company ideology of a &#8220;win-win&#8221; situation to the staff, as being the most desirable outcome in their day to day operations.</p>
<p>He said after the meeting, several of the staff approached him and said &#8220;But if I win, the other person has to lose&#8221;. They just couldn&rsquo;t wrap their head around it. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re up against with the Chinese in a nutshell.</p>

<p>You make an undeniably good point. But that&rsquo;s by no  means a uniquely Chinese trait!  In most of the world, and in the West  too until recently, that was the equivalent of their Social Security and their retirement fund. Their children were an investment.  That&rsquo;s what children were for   &mdash;   to take care of parents in their old age. It&rsquo;s one reason why people, back then, had large families.The more children, the more money. I recall my grandfather telling a story about a woman (when he was a child) who had a large number of children and bragged that she would be &#8220;rich&#8221; with all of those children bringing home their pay to her. That was before 1900, when there was child labor and it was taken for granted that the children&rsquo;s pay belonged to the parents. </p>
<p>I am not young, and I can remember my mother once mentioning (many years ago) about an in-law&rsquo;s mother or grandmother, who had kept her youngest child at home for herself. When I expressed surprise, she told me matter of factly, that it was quite common &#8220;in the old days&#8221; when people had large families&hellip; to raise one of the children, usually the youngest, to stay at home, not marry, and take care of the parents in their old age.  That is long past now, and most people wouldn&rsquo;t even remember it. But it was once common, before there was Social Security.  Your children were your investment fund.  For many people, that was all they had.  It wasn&rsquo;t only the Chinese.</p>
<p>The Chinese (recently arrived) still have that old attitude. But as you said, the Japanese and Chinese here since the mid-1800s  are less demanding because they have been modernized (just like everyone else).</p>

<p>&#8220;Latinos just baffle me; how can people who barely comprehend simple arithmetic be the descendants of the designers of the Mayan Calendar?!&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer is they didn&rsquo;t, generalquagmyer.  The Maya were/are only a small subset of the entire population of peoples we collectively refer to as &#8220;Latinos&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Mayan Calendar system is believed to have its roots with the Olmecs, another Mesoamerican people.  The Olmecs, like the Maya after them, were a people who lived in a highly socially stratified society, i.e. those on top of the social ladder didn&rsquo;t mingle with the riff raff on the bottom.</p>
<p>Mayan kings tended to affairs of state while the priests (who also came from the upper classes and were related to them) kept the calendars and tended to the astronomical observatories.  Archaeological evidence shows that ancient Mayan society, like ancient Etruria and Greece, was divided into city-states or polises.  No Mayan Empire ever existed.</p>
<p>Due to the limited resources in the area of the world the Maya chose to live in, eventually these city-states began warring with one another in an attempt to establish regional hegemony.  The debased Mayan religion guaranteed these wars were gruesome affairs in which blood flowed like wine at an Italian wedding.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/19/world/maya-carvings-tell-of-a-war-of-2-superpowers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/19/world/maya-carvings-tell-of-a-war-of-2-superpowers.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_warfare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_warfare.htm</a></p>
<p>The victors invariably slaughtered the losers.  Archaeological evidence shows they also did their best to extirpate members of the upper classes of the conquered polis (no doubt to remove any chance of future rebellion).</p>
<p>If you know anything at all about eugenics you&rsquo;d know that over time the alleles (variations of the DNA sequence of a particular gene) associated with intelligence tend to cluster in the upper levels of a society through a process known as &#8220;assortative mating&#8221;.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19403080" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19403080</a></p>
<p>As the Mayans happily slaughtered the possesors of these alleles they virtually guaranteed the future end of their culture.  Classical Mayan Culture collapsed centuries before the arrival of the Spaniards for good reason: there was really no one left worth a fig to keep it going.  Modern scholars never mention this in their discussions of the ancient Maya because it doesn&rsquo;t fit with the bioegalitarian worldview (established after WW2) that &#8220;nurture is everything&#8221;.</p>

<p>Another very fine post by you. Unlike myself and some others, your vision is very clear (and is also accurate), and is what&rsquo;s most needed right now. Keep up the good work, please!</p>
<p>Some research concludes that the view a person holds of the world tends to be based on the world we lived in as a child, and that the view acquired as a child tends to remain to some degree immutable. If we were raised in a comfortable middle-class neighborhood where people could be relied upon to be decent and non-dangerous, then as adults we tend to believe that all neighborhoods contain the same kind of people who will act kindly and reasonably if those qualities are appealed to. Until we are brutally educated otherwise, as news articles on this site often show.</p>
<p>I grew up in the 1940s and 1950s in Southern neighborhoods not much worse than that, and at a time when I believe almost all of us whites assumed without even being conscious of it that we were what human life on earth was basically about, and that other peoples were of little consequence in any way except as sometimes causing trouble.</p>
<p>I think a large part of me still lives back there comfortably in 1949 when we whites never imagined that anyone but whites would ever be the dominant force in the world. My MIND realizes that everything has changed, and is now as you say, and that rationally I should have the same strong FEELINGS as you do, but I just can&rsquo;t somehow bring my feelings up to date. (Now that I&rsquo;ve been practicing for some years the excellent advice I got from this site when I first arrived, which was to avoid any interaction with blacks whenever possible, and so now the very bad experiences I and some friends had are receding into the past for me, and my anger is no longer red hot).</p>
<p>Maybe that self-reflection will somehow be of some use to someone.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need to solve our own problems (and decide among ourselves what are problems and what are not problems)&#8221;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more! And so let&rsquo;s decide right now that the following phrase of yours is totally unrelated to reality:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;a totally unrelated medical and religious practice that maintains hygiene and health&#8221;</p>
<p>Feeling good about one&rsquo;s race doesn&rsquo;t mean considering it to be infallible, and we see today in almost every way how, for the benefit of others, white minds have been successfully conditioned to accept the absurd and injurious. I&rsquo;m sorry, but your phrase reflects one of the most egregious examples of that.</p>

<p>Very good point. And that is precisely the problem   &mdash;   that we have relinquished our culture and decisions to others who have their own interests to serve.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how ironic that the race commonly considered to have suffered the most grievous loss in the last century was actually that century&rsquo;s greatest winner (not that its losses weren&rsquo;t real also).&#8221;</p>
<p>That race should serve as a model to us. If our race had the racial awareness and sense of racial identity that that race has, we&rsquo;d be in the &#8220;winner&rsquo;s circle&#8221; today instead of them.</p>
