<h1>Immigrants Call for National Bud Lite Boycott Against Hensley</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Paynter, Technorati (San Francisco), January 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona Immigrant&rsquo;s rights activists plan to call for a boycott of Bud Light because they say it&rsquo;s chief Arizona distributor, Hensley and Co, has made large contributions to candidates backing anti-immigrant legislation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McCain&rsquo;s [Sen. John McCain&rsquo;s] wife, Cindy, owns Hensley-Budweiser according to a post on Chicano Radio. </p>
<p>&#8220;Each time you purchase a Budweiser or Budlight you are funding their pocket&rsquo;s. So stop drinking Budweiser products! Latino&rsquo;s are the biggest consumer&rsquo;s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. IF THEY CAN&rsquo;T SUPPORT THE LATINO&rsquo;S WHY ARE WE SUPPORTING THEM .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&nbsp;!&#8221; a post on the Chicano Radio&rsquo;s web page asks.</p>
<p>In a &#8220;Press Conference To Announce The Boycott&#8221; on Facebook, activist Magarito Blanco said, &#8220;To those businesses that are choosing to contribute to legislators who craft such wasteful, mean-spirited legislation: the boycott continues, even escalates as long as you continue to support hate in place of good, meaningful governance. Hensley and Co, the dominant distributor of Bud Light in Arizona, has contributed large sums of money to the campaigns of Arizona Legislators authoring, or co-sponsoring, or voting for legalized hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>It could be an expensive boycott for Budweiser if the effort goes national. Hispanics are the biggest purchaser of Bud Lite. Activists may be seeking to send the message, anti-immigrant laws are bad for business. </p>
<p>Not all pro-immigrants right&rsquo;s activist agree on the boycott, since Arizona Latino businesses have suffered. An estimated 200,000 Hispanics have fled the state, tired of the racism, and further reducing the tax base. Nearly all agree, however. If the anti-immigrant battle continues, Budweiser-Hensley will likely be one of the biggest losers, and the Bud Lite brand could lose market share nationally in a bid for the competitive Hispanic market.<br>

		<p>Did my own unofficial survey once  on who was drinking what beer. Found that Whites and older Hispanics preferred Miller Lite. Younger Hispanics under 25 (circa 2000)seemed to prefer Coors Light. Bud Light seemed to just sit in the cooler so long that the labels would turn to mush. What I found really interesting is the minimal amount of variance in the age categories. In other words 95% of one age group would prefer one brand over another. Don`t know what it all meant at the time. Figured it was all due to ad campaigns and how old people were when they tuned in&hellip;</p>

		<p>As someone with five relatives of second cousinhood or closer who worked at Anheuser-Busch, I might have actually cared about this story if it happened about three years ago.  But for some odd reason, it no longer interests me.</p>

		<p>Other than the fact that these &#8216;boycotts&rsquo; almost never have any actual effect i was fascinated by the claim that Arizonas &#8216;tax base&rsquo; had been reduced by the departure of so many Hispanics (i presume virtually all illegal immigrants)).</p>
<p>So, apparently illegal immigrants, undercutting American workers and taking their jobs, while not paying taxes or social security contributions, but making full use of taxpayer funded services are helping the &#8216;tax base&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Is it deliberate dishonesty or have people really internalised this nonsense so that they unthinkingly spout it?</p>

		<p>By going after Budweiser they are trying to influence Mccain&rsquo;s vote. I mean, does anyone doubt Budweiser will try to pressure McCain&rsquo;s voting in order to end the boycott? </p>
<p>On the other hand. As much as I dislike McCain I have to admit he is stubborn and not easily pressured. The guy spent 7 years as a POW and even refused to be released while his fellow POWs were still being held. So this might just make him mad. Also, if he flip-flops on immigration enforcement then it will be obvious to everyone. And that&rsquo;s not good now that the political winds are favoring immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say this was a risky move on the part of the illegal invaders. And it tells me that they&rsquo;re desperate.</p>

		<p>I hope the boycott is successful, perhaps then it will reduce the number of Americans killed by beer drinking Illegal Aliens driving on the wrong side of freeway or road. Hope does spring eternal.</p>

		<p>Go for it; I welcome the boycott and the reduction in crime that will follow.</p>
<p>My observations are different from the previous posters.  In my state, Budweiser is the beer of choice for Hispanics.  In fact, when people ask me to name a Mexican beer, I tell them &#8220;Budweiser&#8221; as a joke.</p>
<p>A true boycott would really hurt AB&rsquo;s business, but it would greatly reduce drunk driving, spousal abuse, and stabbings in the state.</p>

		<p>  I started boycotting ALL Miller Beer products when I found out that they gave alot of money and support to Hispanic causes. And that is a fact. It caused a big stink in my area. One of Miller&rsquo;s biggest, if not biggest plants is in Trenton, Ohio. Just miles from me. I drink Budweiser and will never drink Miller again. That&rsquo;s been 5 years now. If Budweiser screws up, I will drink only beer imported from Europe. Makes no difference to me. They screw me, I screw back.</p>
