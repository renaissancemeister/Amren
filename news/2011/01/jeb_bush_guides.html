<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110113/US.GOP.Seeking.Hispanics/">Jeb Bush Guides Republican Outreach to Latinos</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Wides-Munoz, Comcast News, January 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Republican group that includes former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will use a conference Thursday to kick off its efforts to improve the party&rsquo;s outreach to Hispanic voters, many of whom have been critical of some GOP candidates&rsquo; harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The new Hispanic Action Network is part of a growing number of Republican organizations reaching out to Hispanics in advance of next year&rsquo;s presidential election  &mdash;  and it has powerful support.</p>
<p>The group is backed by former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman, whose American Action Network funneled more than $30 million in campaign funds to Republicans in about 30 congressional races last year.</p>
<p>Republicans don&rsquo;t need to win a majority of Hispanic votes. But with the Latino population growing in swing states such as Nevada, Colorado and Florida, Republicans need to chip away at Hispanics&rsquo; overall 2-1 preference for Democrats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Bush and other Republicans have long maintained their party is a natural fit for Hispanics, particularly recent immigrants. They cite the party&rsquo;s social conservatism, anti-abortion stance and positions in support of private school vouchers and other school choice measures as well as lower taxes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bush, who met his Mexican-born wife Columba when he taught English in her homeland, said the party needs to be more engaged in the Hispanic community and not just during election campaigns.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Given his close ties to the Cuban-American community, his work on Latin American trade and his own Mexican-American children, Jeb Bush is widely viewed as one of the few Republicans who could capture a sizable Latino vote in a national race.</p>
<p>The Republican groups need to overcome several obstacles. The immigration rhetoric of some GOP candidates frequently overshadowed other issues during the 2010 election, such as when tea party-backed Republican Senate candidate Sharon Angle of Nevada ran ads portraying illegal immigrants as thuggish gang members. In Colorado, Democrat Michael Bennet narrowly won the Senate race last year after Latinos overwhelming backed him over Republican Ken Buck. Buck, a former county prosecutor, had tried to deport more illegal immigrants by seizing income-tax returns from accountants that catered to Spanish speakers. The plan was later thrown out by a court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeb Bush represents the future of the Republican Party. But he doesn&rsquo;t represent the present,&#8221; Rosenberg [Simon Rosenberg, head of the liberal-leaning NDN organization] said.</p>

		<p>The article almost nails it   &mdash;   Cubans are the reason why Jeb Bush won two statewide elections in Florida.  Not the other kinds of Hispanics.</p>
<p>Sharron Angle lost in Nevada because 21% of the state&rsquo;s white voters voted for the Republican for Governor and also for Harry Reid at the same time.  Hispanics voted for her and the Republican for Governor at about the same percentage.  Ken Buck might have lost in Colorado to Michael Bennet, in spite of leading in the polls for most of the season, maybe because of &#8220;off the radar&#8221; Hispanic voters, but another possibility is that Colorado is filling up with liberal whites fleeing California.</p>
<p>As for what Hispanic voters really want?  I&rsquo;ll leave that to a Hispanic ex-Governor of a traditionally Hispanic state, New Mexico&rsquo;s Bill Richardson:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fully funded welfare programs.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Jeb Bush is doing the impossible:   He&rsquo;s showing that it is possible to be worse on immigration than even his brother.  Under no circumstances should the GOP nominate him for President or Vice President.  </p>

		<p>Jeb Bush does NOT represent conservatives.  He DOES represent everything that is wrong with the Republican party.  Fortunately, the Bush name has been so sullied by their betrayals that no Bush will sit in the oval office again.  Jeb is in a dream world.<br/>
But then, maybe I am also, thinking the PEOPLE elect presidents.  The MACHINE, bilderburgers, globalists, etc elect our Presidents.  And our Presidents appoint cabinet members, heads of all agencies, federal judges at all levels, sign treaties pushed through only ONE house of legislators - the one most likely to subvert the will of the people (Senate), and has the executive pardon power and the executive order power.<br/>
He is also the commander in chief of the armed forces, which are ever more being used for domestic policing.  Don&rsquo;t let anybody tell you a president can get nothing done &#8220;without congress&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>As a Floridian I can tell you that Jeb Bush is the worst kind of &#8220;conservative.&#8221;  He did nothing to help the white middle class when he was Gov of Florida.  When Ward Connerly came to challenge the racist affirmative action policy of the state Bush was instrumental in getting the state supreme court to overturn the initiative that the people voted for.  He then held a press conference where he gloated, &#8220;Mr. Connerly, you aren&rsquo;t needed in Florida&#8221;, while he implemented his own plan which called for automatic admission into college of everyone in the top 20 percent of their school, no matter how bad it is.  Essentially he is just another Bush.       </p>

		<p>When will the Republicans learn that the Hispanics, by and large, are not their friends? The Republicans would be far better served to do what they&rsquo;re already accused repeatedly by leftists of doing: Appeal directly to white interests. Right now, whites are still the majority of the population (about 60%, I&rsquo;d say, to account for the &#8220;whites&#8221; under the census who aren&rsquo;t really white), and because we&rsquo;re more likely to be citizens and to register to vote than other citizens, we make up an even larger part of the electorate. If whites voted for Republicans at the rate that blacks vote for Democrats (90%), the Republicans could sweep both houses of Congress and the White House without any trouble. Then they could, oh, I don&rsquo;t know, get rid of the illegal immigrants, and put a complete halt on further immigration (though I would be all for granting asylum to certain groups. Like the Boers, for example). Then they could detach the thoroughly Hispanicized parts of the southwest (which are economic basket cases anyway) and salvage the rest of the country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice fantasy, I suppose, but that would actually require the Republicans to have some sense. And while the Tea Partiers are at least marginally more sensible than folks like Newt &#8220;El Hispanderero&#8221; Gingrich, they (or at least the Glenn Beck-types) are notoriously sensitive about anyone mentioning the &#8220;R&#8221;-word, or calling them the &#8220;W&#8221;-word.</p>
<p>Instead we&rsquo;ll probably see the browning of the country proceed apace, until whites can no longer pretend the brown people are their friends, and at which point it will be impossible to do anything about it, other than possibly eke out a small homeland for ourselves on the margins.</p>

		<p>We all know how Republicans will seek to gain Hispanic votes   &mdash;   by promising to never, ever, enforce immigration law.  That&rsquo;s how Dick Armey and the Bushes do it.  The lords of the mass media love illegal immigration (the rare exceptions, like Lou Dobbs, lose their jobs).  So we can be sure that the media will anoint whichever Republican is most in favor of illegal immigration as the next presidential candidate, just as in 2007/2008 the media did its best to ignore Ron Paul and pump up the egregious John McCain.</p>

		<p>I am really sick of the Bushes and I know many others are too. I&rsquo;d bet Jeb would like to be president and thinks Hispanic votes could be crucial. And he&rsquo;s probably right, given the ongoing invasion from the South. Jeb says he has no interst in running for president but I don&rsquo;t believe it. All the Bushes just love Hispanics more than they do whites. Disguse with &#8220;W&#8221; is one of the reasons we got Obama.</p>

They&rsquo;re not as truly disgusting as the Kennedys, that &#8220;large and dirty family,&#8221; as P J O&rsquo;Rourke once called them, but they&rsquo;re a strangely non-ideological bunch of tongue-tied bunglers who seem driven by nothing more than the desire to be in political office.

		<p>When will modern-day white republicans get it???  Most blacks and most hispanics, I&rsquo;m sorry to say, don&rsquo;t have much in common with traditional whites.  We have different cultures, different values, different views on how government should function, etc.  Blacks and hispanics love big government because it provides them all their goodies and it&rsquo;s payback against whitey, whereas most whites hate big government because that means more of our resources will be taken away from us to go to others.</p>

		<p>Despite the Tea Parties and their alleged affiliation with the Republican Party, the Republican party cares not a whit for the average, middle-class American voter. As soon as the Tea Party proved to be a lasting phenomenon, the odious Dick Armey and the sleazy, fraud Newt Gingrich popped out of the closet and acted as though they were the appointed leaders of the group. These and other kindred slime will try to push for another Bush in 2012. Please people, don&rsquo;t be fooled. He&rsquo;ll bring the legions of Mexico here. Read his Spanish-speaking lips, but don&rsquo;t bring him in as a nominee. </p>
<p>Several years ago, Jessie Jackson said the only thing that I&rsquo;ve ever agreed with him about. He said: &#8220;&hellip;Stay out the Bushes!&#8221; I could not agree with him more. We&rsquo;ve all seen the terrible damage that these clowns have done to the U.S! Don&rsquo;t be fooled again. Raise a ground swell against him. No more Bushes!</p>

		<p>Bush represents the business community first and foremost.  His whining about hispanics belies the fact that the real reason he and is cohorts want unlimited immigraion is for cheap labor.  It just sounds a lot better to claim you are fighting for minority rights and equality rather than undercutting my wages.  </p>

		<p>I do not believe, for a single minute, that Jeb Bush has no presidential ambitions for 2012.  I have this sneaking suspicion that the Republicans are banking on any disillusion with hope and change to overcome our Bush Fatigue of 2008.  Sorry, folks, but my Bush Fatigue is still going strong.  The LAST thing I want to deal with is the kind of Bush-Rove strategy that involved writing off White Americans to actively court illegal Latinos.  </p>
<p>This little weasel is all over the place just like John McCain and his Straight Talk Express was.  Even though the old fart was universally despised by the Republicans, he was still the last one left standing.  I will NOT hold my nose and sign off on the last Republican left standing this time.  I refuse to vote for the lesser of two evils.  </p>
<p>If Jeb Bush is the Republican nominee, I will vote third party even if Obama gets four more years.  Whatever one might say about Obama, he has kept us out of Iran and though he made a lot of noise about passing comprehensive immigration &#8220;reform,&#8221; it didn&rsquo;t happen even though he had the Democratic numbers and the Republican collaborators (McCain, Graham, etc. ad nauseum ad infinitum) to pass it.<br/>
