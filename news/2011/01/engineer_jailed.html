<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Noshir Gowadia, 66, made profits of at least USD$110,000 (Â£68,000) by selling classified engine technology that China needed for its design of a stealth cruise missile that could evade infra-red detection, the court heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;He broke his oath of loyalty to this country,&#8221; said Judge Susan Oki Mollway passing sentence after a hearing in Honolulu, Hawaii, &#8220;He was found guilty of marketing valuable technology to foreign countries for personal gain.&#8221; Gowadia, an engineer with the Northrop Grumman Corporation between 1968-88 who worked on the B-2 design, made repeated trips to China between 2003 and 2005 providing &#8220;defence services&#8221; to China&rsquo;s cruise missile programme as a freelance consultant.</p>
<p>The prosecution had called on the judge to impose a life sentence on Gowadia who used the proceeds of the sales to fund a luxury lifestyle on Hawaii where he lived in a multi-million dollar home overlooking the ocean on Maui.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers for Gowadia, an Indian-born engineer who worked on the engine design for the B-2 bomber, had argued that he had sold only unclassified technology.</p>
<p>However after a 40-day trial, he was convicted on 14 charges including communicating national defence information to aid a foreign nation, violating the arms export control act and several counts of money-laundering and tax fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;He provided some of our country&rsquo;s most sensitive weapons-related designs to the Chinese government for money,&#8221; Assistant Attorney General for National Security David Kris said in a statement after the trial.</p>
<p>Earlier this month China unveiled its first ever stealth fighter, the Chengdu J20, which is said to have been based on technology gleaned partly from parts of a US F-117 stealth fighter shot down over Serbia in 1999 during the Kosovo conflict.</p>
<p>China, who has promised a &#8220;peaceful rise&#8221;, is currently investing heavily in upgrading its armed forces, including stealth technology, aircraft carriers and long-range missiles, raising concerns in Washington and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re a little disappointed (the judge) didn&rsquo;t give him a life sentence, that&rsquo;s the sentence that would&rsquo;ve sent the best message,&#8221; said assistant US attorney Ken Sorenson said after the hearing, &#8220;But 32 years is stiff and in many ways an appropriate sentence for him.&#8221; His son, Ashton Gowadia said after the sentence that his father intended to appeal against the verdict.<br>

		<p>The growing number of Chinese in the United States and Canada are presenting a problem for intelligence services.</p>
<p>It also makes for uncomfortable hiring and advancement practices, as government, private enterprise and defense services cannot openly discriminate by race, yet Chinese nationals are considered too great a risk to have access to sensitive information.</p>

		<p>What some people may not understand is that for Mr. Gowadia to get to the position he held, it was necessary for him to sign a STACK of documents, both Northrop/GE proprietary and NatSec based, which essesntially pledged his allegiance to our nation a a far higher fiduciary level than the average Joe Citizen and indeed, likely made it illegal for him to do a lot of the things we take for granted.</p>
<p>Including traveling overseas to &#8216;consult&rsquo; in his field of expertise, with a competing foreign power.</p>
<p>Being a presumably high-level aero-structures engineer (I should note here that the exhaust system on the B-2 had to be redesigned, twice&hellip;) he was not too stupid or lacking in fluency to know any better.</p>
<p>If it were up to me and assuming I could trust the Indian Government to keep tabs on the man, I would strip him to his last penny mark him as the lowest of the low untouchables in their caste system.  And then throw him into the stews of a place like this-</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/KYqBK" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/KYqBK</a></p>
<p>There to spend the hopefully short remainder of his days with a GPS tag on his ankle, wondering why he thought he had to bite the hand that had lifted him up.</p>

		<p>This is what you get when immigration policy exists to serve the needs of Bill Gates. And what you get is the year by year destruction of a Native Born White American scientific and engineering workforce.</p>
<p>It would had been a much better idea if America had remained labor self-self-sufficient labor policy like it was prior to the passage of the treasonous 1965 Immigration Reform Act.</p>
<p>As I have stated many times here:there is no economic,ecological-environmental and demographic need to import even one Hindu into America.</p>
<p>The intent of those who control post-1965 immigration policy is to make Native Americans a very rapidly dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. And in the process of becoming a racial minority within the borders of America, Native Born White Americans will be reduced to a population of unskilled low wage serfs and they will see the nation the founded and in which they have been a racial minority from the beginning to devolve into  an overpopulated pool.</p>
<p>It is a policy decision-not a divine edict from above-to allow to continue, an immigration policy that a hostile Chinese-Hindu fifth column-legal immigrants- to grow and grow and acquire acquire enormous political power and influence over the US political system.</p>
<p>Treason is the reason&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Part of the problem lies with the absurdly easy U.S. citizenship tests (necessary for the government clearance), which most people can pass without any studying beforehand.  No self-respecting nation would grant citizenship to a foreigner purely on his ability to name the colors of the flag and the capital of the country.  Easy citizenship tests result in a profound lack of respect the newly minted &#8220;American&#8221; has towards his new country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in the defense field for many years and sometimes hear comments from naturalized U.S. citizens with clearances claiming that they only reason they became American was to get their clearance.  And yes, loyalties, in particular with the formerly mainland Chinese nationals, usually remain with their homeland.  </p>

		<p>Keep arguing America, that we need to bring more of these people in. We are being plundered on a scale that has never existed before in U.S. history. The globalists are using these industrial spies posing as &#8220;highly skilled guest workers&#8221; to transfer all our knowledge and know-how to enemy communist countries wholesale in order to complete our destruction.</p>
<p>Globalists bankers don&rsquo;t like freedom and the U.S. Constitution - it&rsquo;s too easy to sue the gov&rsquo;t. They would much rather have a Chinese-style communist dictatorship that can put a bullet into the head of anyone who resists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where this is all leading people - once everything we have is sucked out, the end game is to annihilate us and move all of China&rsquo;s and India&rsquo;s slaves onto our land where they can be taxed at gunpoint.</p>

		<p>The F-117 stealth &#8220;fighter&#8221; (really a light attack bomber - a stealthy version of the A-4 Skyhawk or A-7 Corsair II) shot down over Serbia mentioned in the article probably did not have a major bearing on the design of China&rsquo;s J-20 jet.  The F-117 was developed from the &#8220;Have Blue&#8221; aircraft, which first flew in 1977, making the technology approximately 25 years old by the time the F-117 was downed in 1999.  I say &#8220;approximately&#8221; because I do not know when the Have Blue project was started.  The F-117 is no longer used by the USAF, which discontinued flying them in early 2008.  The technology Gowadia illegally transferred will have a much more serious impact; since it was B-2 technology, it is much more current.</p>

<p>This sounds like a typical leftist response to my post. Let&rsquo;s not answer my question and not focus on all the positive ideas that China got from the West. Let&rsquo;s instead focus on one of the few negative ideas China got from the West, and then go on to blame the West for China ever adopting the idea. Are nonwhites held accountable for anything, and are whites allowed to receive the credit they deserve for all the good things they have given the world? </p>

&#8220;This sounds like a typical leftist response to my post. Let&rsquo;s not answer my question and not focus on all the positive ideas that China got from the West.&#8221;<br>
I&rsquo;ll try and answer the question for the poster:<br>
China would obviously not be where it was today. However, the West would be a bit lost without gunpowder and colonisation would have been a lot more difficult. China is playing catchup after centuries of stagnation. There will doubtless be many achievements in their own right within the next few decades.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are nonwhites held accountable for anything, and are whites allowed to receive the credit they deserve for all the good things they have given the world? &#8220;<br>
Of course they are. What did you think Hiroshima was about. I also hold Asians accountable for Genghis Khan as well as the introduction of firearms.</p>

		<p>End to Illusion, comparing the West&rsquo;s many achievements to China&rsquo;s achievements is like comparing apples and oranges. I have debated this for several years with posters who like to play a similar game you are playing. Gunpowder and a few other crude  inventions hardly compare to developing airplanes, modern medicine, computers etc&hellip; To make such a comparison is downright offensive, actually. </p>
<p>And then you go on to credit Asians with developing firearms later in your post.  Which is it? Gunpowder or firearms?  Asians didn&rsquo;t invent guns; Europeans did.</p>
<p>And sorry, but I also don&rsquo;t agree that Asians are held accountable for things in the same way whites are overall. You have to be joking.</p>
<p>And I am guessing that either you or someone else will say to me that it is unfair to compare Chinese achievements from so long ago to what Westerners have achieved recently. Well, yes it is fair. Every book I have read that discusses the history of science and technology, makes it pretty clear that Europe has always had the edge in what it took to create the modern world, going all the way back to the time of Greece. </p>
<p>Yes, Europe has had some down times (Middle Ages), but notice how it is only during the Middle Ages that we get bombarded by leftist historians reminding us about how &#8220;the Middle East, India and China were so much more advanced during that time&#8221;, while they are unable to make the same case when discussing Greece or Rome. Why do they always pick the time when Europe was at its lowest point to remind us about how &#8220;the rest of the world was more advanced&#8221;?</p>
<p>When the odds are 90 to 1, when comparing Europe&rsquo;s achievements to the rest of the world, arguments like your&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t hold water. There is obviously something inherently unique about Europeans, that only having a high IQ won&rsquo;t get you.</p>
<p>If Asia was as advanced historically as people like to claim, then they should have beat Europe to all these achievements a very long time ago. Enough with the excuses.</p>

		<p>FYI this guy&rsquo;s ancestry is from Iran, they were given asylum in India about a thousand years ago after Islamic&rsquo;s attacked Iran, however, they in my opinion have not had much loyalty towards India especially after the British colonized India. Parsees as they are known were boot lickers of the British and acted like they were superior to the darker skinned natives. Considering they didn&rsquo;t have any loyalty to the asylum givers in India I don&rsquo;t see why they would have any loyalty to the USA. This guy is not a Hindu.</p>

&#8220;Gunpowder or firearms?&#8221;<br>
Both for that matter. The Chinese were also the first to use muskets, but the Europeans improved it with breech-loading among other innovations.</p>
<p>&#8220;And sorry, but I also don&rsquo;t agree that Asians are held accountable for things in the same way whites are overall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you believe Whites are pilloried? Do you walk down a street and see yourself as being the victim of blame for what some White people did a couple of hundred years ago? I hope not. For I don&rsquo;t think the average person in any country holds you personally accountable for anything.<br>
Please also define what it means to be &#8220;held accountable&#8221;. Whites don&rsquo;t pay any extra taxes because of their race and are equal before the law, and are not subject to discrimination either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Europe has had some down times (Middle Ages), but notice how it is only during the Middle Ages that we get bombarded by leftist historians reminding us about how &ldquo;the Middle East, India and China were so much more advanced during that time&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>China was also on par with the Later Roman Republic and Early Roman Empire, as well as being technologically superior than the West from the 5th to early 15th centuries. That makes about 1500 years of parity with (or superiority over) the West, which is much more than just a short period. And contrary to popular belief, the Black Death which hit Europe and was blamed for its temporary backwardness, also hit China (though admittedly with less deaths).</p>
<p>Feel free to dispute my claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough with the excuses.&#8221;<br>
I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m making any. I am merely pointing out what I believe are relevant facts and ideas. I also wish to impress upon you that I hold no illusions about Asians. If you have read any of my other posts, you will know I offer a clear account of Asians and am well aware of their flaws; which mainly consist of avarice and a lack of courage to embrace unfamiliar things.</p>

		<p>End to Illusion,</p>
<p>You follow in lock step the usual revisionist anti-white history that liberals have fabricated over the last half century. It disturbs me that whites like you fall for it.  This is the problem with our civilization right now.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that the Chinese are given credit for inventing many white inventions &#8220;first&#8221; when what they actually invented was a crude version of what whites later invented.  It is down right insulting. Do you also credit the Chinese with space travel since they invented firework size &#8220;rockets&#8221;?????  The Chinese have also been credited with inventing the helicopter.  Do you believe that too?  This &#8220;helicopter&#8221; that they are credited with was a children&rsquo;s toy that spins in the air after you twist it between your palms.</p>
<p>As for the Chinese having firearms before us, please explain to me why the Japanese had never seen guns until the Europeans went over there?  Why were they so impressed with European weapons if the Chinese had already been using them for centuries?</p>
<p>Your views about whites &#8220;not being held any more accountable than Asians&#8221; are appauling. For one thing, Asians have the nerve to immigrate here and then go on to complain about how we rounded Japanese immigrants up during WWII.  I am waiting for the Japanese to be held accountable for racist things they do to immigrants in their&hellip;..oh no wait a minute&hellip;.the Japanese don&rsquo;t even allow immigrants in their country. Only white countries are expected to do that by the U.N. etc&hellip;but never Asian countries.  Who is ridiculed for not giving enough foreign aid when there is a disaster somewhere?  Meanwhile the Asian countries hardly give anything compared to whites, but nobody says anything to them.</p>
<p>Then you proceed to lecture me on the usual p.c. version of history which nags us whites about how &#8220;China was so much more advanced from such and such time to such and such time&#8221;.  You obviously didn&rsquo;t read my post clearly enough.  How does this dispute my factually proven (by many books) point that the West has created 90% of history&rsquo;s achievements?  </p>
<p>And you actually add to my argument.  If the Chinese were so advanced during that long stretch of time, then why did they produce so little compared to what Europe has produced?  You can&rsquo;t have it both ways, sir. I am very insulted when I am reminded about China being more advanced during such and such length of time as a rebuttal to my point about comparing achievements, when the fact of the matter is that China had as much of an opportunity to get into space first if what everything you say is true, but THEY DIDN&rsquo;T.  </p>
<p>White people are where they are at due to their own merits, sir.  It has nothing to do with learning about gunpowder from the Chinese in such and such century.  And please tell me why the Chinese were so impressed with the scientific knowledge of Portuguese missionaries during that time period and even before????</p>
<p>Please tell me by what parameters are we going by when we say the Chinese were more advanced during a certain time?  Who had the knowledge required to create the modern world?  Europe did, going all the way back to Greece.  China never did.  That was my point, as well.</p>
<p>Then in your last paragraph you acknowledge that the Chinese won&rsquo;t try new things.  Really?  I thought a minute ago you were telling me they were equal to whites in their inventive abilities.</p>

<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>I agree with Courtney.<br>
Advanced knowledge and technology begins and ends with the white race.</p>
<p>Revisionists have tried to rewrite white history since the first sunken realm but serve no other purpose than that which<br>
aids the cunning to declare that whites are less then #1.</p>
<p>Whites have a distinct sense of knowledge and intuition that interfaces with the science of nature.</p>
<p>Whites invented electric drills and power saws used to carve the temples of Egypt 3,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The team at D.A.R.P.A. who invented the first computer was entirely white.</p>
<p>Brent Miller was responsible for the main computer system in the F-14 Tomcat.</p>
<p>The list of white achievements in knowledge and technology can go on for a long time and are too high to appease immigration.                                        </p>

		<p>Courtney,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come across your posts from time to time on AMREN. And, I must say you have a peculiar complex with Asians&hellip;.It&rsquo;s like I am listening to someone who&rsquo;s been neglected and underappreciated.</p>
<p>Okay, I am Chinese. If it lets you sleep better at night or make your day even, I am more than willing to applaud you, as a fine member of the white race, on your accomplishments and contributions. You and YOUR kind have made the world what it is today. I am utterly indebted to you. Heck, I am willing to throw all Chinese inventions over to the white race. You guys can have them. Whites are the most intelligent, the most creative, the most beautiful, the bravest, the superlatives. Oh I love that whites came up with ketchup too, and it&rsquo;s even red my favorite color. Drizzled on MacDonald&rsquo;s french fries&hellip;absolutely heavenly.</p>
<p>So I have spoken. And Courtney, have a wonderful wonderful day!! I mean it.</p>

		<p>Courtney are you of sound mind? I sound like a leftist? What kind of leftist calls communism an evil? I ignore positive ideas from the west? Well like all you fine white people here say communism is too great an evil to ignore and it destroys civilization! It&rsquo;s pretty much negated all other &#8220;postitive&#8221; ideas from the west like the death cult you call Christianity! If anything this cult instills a sense of racial inferiority justified by religion among the Chinese that fall for it. I have heard what they say and have seen what they do. </p>
<p>Comparing Chinese achivements and white achivements are like comparing apples to oranges? Then how do you prove the superiority of apples over oranges like you must do?</p>

		<p>To Poster 20:<br>
Point taken. I meant the arquebus, which was used by the Chinese from the 1350s, which reached widespread use in Europe in the mid 1400s. As far as I know though, an arquebus is the first firearm, and the early European models are not superior in quality to the Chinese ones.</p>
<p>Poster 21 Courtney:<br>
&#8220;Do you also credit the Chinese with space travel since they invented firework size &ldquo;rockets&rdquo;????? The Chinese have also been credited with inventing the helicopter. Do you believe that too? This &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; that they are credited with was a children&rsquo;s toy that spins in the air after you twist it between your palms.&#8221;</p>
<p>You appear to be trying to put words in my mouth. You know well I believe in none of those things.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for the Chinese having firearms before us, please explain to me why the Japanese had never seen guns until the Europeans went over there? Why were they so impressed with European weapons if the Chinese had already been using them for centuries?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have no idea. But the Chinese had firearms. They were standard issue in the Divine Engine Division of the Ming Dynasty, and I have seen some of the weapons in a museum in Nanjing. Europeans surpassed the Chinese in expertise in the mid to late 1400s. I&rsquo;m quite sure these are accepted facts. The first widespread use of firearms in Europe was in Hungary in the 1450s, where one out of every three soldiers had a firearm. In China, firearms were first used in the mid 1300s, and during the 1410s, 10% of the Chinese army had firearms, rising to a quarter towards the 1500 and nearing a third in the 1600s (thanks to European imports). But as to the first to USE and HAVE firearms, it was definitely the Chinese.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your views about whites &ldquo;not being held any more accountable than Asians&rdquo; are appauling&#8221;<br>
You have failed to define what being &#8220;held accountable&#8221; means. <br>
In my mind, being held accountable means being dragged before a tribunal of some sort, or else being discriminated against in a tangible way. I don&rsquo;t think any person of any race suffers this in America and I&rsquo;m happy to be able to say that. If you dispute my understanding of &#8220;being held accountable, then please reply, with your own definition&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please tell me by what parameters are we going by when we say the Chinese were more advanced during a certain time? Who had the knowledge required to create the modern world? Europe did, going all the way back to Greece. China never did. That was my point, as well.&#8221;<br>
The Chinese had a system of meritocracy back in the 2nd century BC, something Europe lacked until the Renaissance; that was the root of their advantage over the West. As to your claim of &#8220;knowledge required to create the modern world&#8221;, it reeks of determinism. Allow me to turn the question on its head and ask what Europe had that China didn&rsquo;t (before 1500)? Both had a code of laws (well the Romans didn&rsquo;t but that&rsquo;s another story), both had a great literary tradition, both have volumes of treatises passed through the ages filled with information and scientific advances. My claims of them being more advanced were already conceded by you in the first post. You concede yourself that the Chinese were more advanced in the Dark and Middle Ages.<br>
Quoting you in post 17:<br>
&#8220;Yes, Europe has had some down times (Middle Ages), but notice how it is only during the Middle Ages that we get bombarded by leftist historians reminding us about how &ldquo;the Middle East, India and China were so much more advanced during that time&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>I merely add to that the late Republic in Rome; which saw the Roman system break down, while the Chinese one flourished. The Chinese also were superior to the Romans up to the reign of Hadrian, as due to the repressive and tumultuous reigns of figures such as Tiberius and Caligula, we see nothing of worth come out of Rome other than the works of Horace, Virgil and Seneca.</p>
<p>&#8220;And please tell me why the Chinese were so impressed with the scientific knowledge of Portuguese missionaries during that time period and even before????&#8221;<br>
Matteo Ricci was the first Westerner to impress the Chinese, and he came in the late 1500s, a time by which China had clearly fallen behind the West. I seem to remember Marco Polo was impressed by the Chinese and not the other way around, and he only arrived 300 years previously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am waiting for the Japanese to be held accountable for racist things they do to immigrants in their&hellip;..oh no wait a minute&hellip;.the Japanese don&rsquo;t even allow immigrants in their country. Only white countries are expected to do that by the U.N. etc&hellip;but never Asian countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read some of my other posts, then you&rsquo;d know I&rsquo;m all for more immigration to East Asia. In fact, that&rsquo;s where I believe its needed most. You&rsquo;re not right about the UN only being after White countries. in 2005, the UN released a damning report against racism in Japan. As far as I know no such report has been released against any White country save for France and Australia.<br>
My views on Asian immigration policies can be best gauged by looking at my posts on the article &#8220;Back to the days of Blackface&#8221;, featured on amren a while ago. I see the East Asians as a &#8220;racist&#8221; (yes that word again!) group of people, who need to allow more immigration (especially in the case of Japan) to safeguard their futures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then in your last paragraph you acknowledge that the Chinese won&rsquo;t try new things. Really? I thought a minute ago you were telling me they were equal to whites in their inventive abilities.&#8221;<br>
Those two traits are not mutually exclusive. By &#8220;trying new things&#8221;, I meant embracing other cultures, meaning the Chinese are xenophobic. They also have an addiction to investing surplus money in property, being scared of the stock market. They are more than happy to try things and fail if the cost isn&rsquo;t too great if they do. I could present you with a list of some of the emerging technologies the Chinese are trying to develop, but I don&rsquo;t think that would convince you. If you feel inclined though Google &#8220;straddling bus&#8221; and tell me what you think of it.</p>
<p>If you have anything else to say please reply, and I will do so as well. Peace be upon you.</p>

Personally I strongly disagree with many white nationalists that &#8220;this is it&#8221; in terms of human evolution.  In the future it&rsquo;s quite possible that the average human being will be far more intelligent than what the creatures calling themselves human today.  Once we&rsquo;ve perfect systems biology and understand how to engineer the very building blocks of life we could create descendants far more intelligent than their parents.  We came about due to a semi random process of natural selection once we develop the technology to engineer biological systems the way we&rsquo;ve develop other engineering systems it will only be a matter of time until we begin enhancing our own species.  Note that we have been selectively breeding other species for thousands of years.</p>

<p>We are just a stop sign on the evolutionary road and I think we should think of all the species before us that have come and gone.  Man is finite in his wisdom and even his basic understanding of what the world is or what it could be.  </p>

<p>You admit later in your post that you are Chinese. What purpose does it serve you to occupy yourself with this website? Before you charge me for having an obsession with Asians, why exactly are you obsessed with whites?</p>
<p>Your race isn&rsquo;t in the kind of danger that mine is in right now due to liberal multicultural policies. It says a lot about you that you would come on here and post a comment like that despite the circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comparing Chinese achivements and white achivements are like comparing apples to oranges? Then how do you prove the superiority of apples over oranges like you must do?&#8221;</p>
<p>How do you prove that computers are superior to abacuses or that washing machines are superior to wash boards?  Are you really asking me that question?</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no idea. But the Chinese had firearms. They were standard issue in the Divine Engine Division of the Ming Dynasty, and I have seen some of the weapons in a museum in Nanjing. Europeans surpassed the Chinese in expertise in the mid to late 1400s. I&rsquo;m quite sure these are accepted facts.

But as to the first to USE and HAVE firearms, it was definitely the Chinese.&#8221;</p>
<p>This entire paragraph means nothing if you got it from a liberal source such as Wikipedia and many others, or Chinese (biased) museums for that matter. And this is what I stressed in my other post when I mentioned the need to think about what it was that the Chinese actually developed. In your case, what do we mean by &#8220;firearm&#8221;?  I have watched shows about this on the History Channel (and have read books about it). The &#8220;firearms&#8221; the Chinese had were nothing like what we can call a &#8220;gun&#8221; by any means. They were more like fireworks that were shot through bamboo shoots to light the sky up, but they weren&rsquo;t used as weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have failed to define what being &#8216;held accountable&rsquo; means.&#8221; </p>
<p>You know very well what I mean. To use the above anonymous poster&rsquo;s post as an example, he wanted to blame Westerners for the fact that the Chinese adopted Communism but he didn&rsquo;t want to acknowledge all the good things China learned from the West in his original post. This is the same sort of talk you hear from modern adademics (liberal), and anti-white politicians and economists from all around the world right now. If China is Communist, it is the fault of Westerners. If the Japanese are eating too many hamburgers, it is the fault of Westerners, and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese had a system of meritocracy back in the 2nd century BC, something Europe lacked until the Renaissance; that was the root of their advantage over the West. As to your claim of &ldquo;knowledge required to create the modern world&rdquo;, it reeks of determinism. Allow me to turn the question on its head and ask what Europe had that China didn&rsquo;t (before 1500)? Both had a code of laws (well the Romans didn&rsquo;t but that&rsquo;s another story), both had a great literary tradition, both have volumes of treatises passed through the ages filled with information and scientific advances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, now we are getting somewhere. I guess if we pick and choose what we wish to go by, it is easy for any historian to make it seem as if China was more advanced during a certain time. </p>
<p>As for information needed to create the modern world, I have read many books on the history of science and they all devote 80-90% of their page space to discussing what came out of Europe going all the way back to Greece. None of these books have ever proved that any where near an equal amount of science came out of China. Science has always been a uniquely European concept. Other civilizations had forms of math and technology which is entirely different. The Aztecs had math and technology but is that a civilization that we like to admire compared to others?</p>
<p>One book inparticular that you should read is &#8220;Human Accomplishment&#8221; .  The author has an Asian bias that is loomingly obvious, and he even admits that it was his mission to prove that Asians have dominated human achievement. He spent a great amount of time reading sources from all around the world (not just Western) and unfortunately for him, the data, which he shows in his book, all ended up pointing to a different outcome than what he had hoped for&hellip;.roughly 90% of human accomplishments in history have come out of post-Renaissance Europe as well as Ancient Greece, and that doesn&rsquo;t even include the accomplishments coming out of Europe during Rome and the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>&#8220;My claims of them being more advanced were already conceded by you in the first post. You concede yourself that the Chinese were more advanced in the Dark and Middle Ages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow!  You completely missed my point in what I was saying there. I don&rsquo;t know if it is even worth it for me to explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I merely add to that the late Republic in Rome; which saw the Roman system break down, while the Chinese one flourished. The Chinese also were superior to the Romans up to the reign of Hadrian, as due to the repressive and tumultuous reigns of figures such as Tiberius and Caligula, we see nothing of worth come out of Rome other than the works of Horace, Virgil and Seneca.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, you are using the word &#8216;superior&rsquo; based on your own pro-Asian biases, and by only going by what you want to. Why don&rsquo;t we compare architecture? Someone like you will read an anti-white version of history and come to the conclusion that &#8216;the Great Wall was the greatest wonder the world had ever seen&rsquo; without doing any thinking for yourself on the matter. What is more impressive: A long wall that was built with the same sturdiness of European castle walls during the Middle Ages, and that is only remarkable because of its length, or the massive arenas, domed structures, and aqueducts built by Romans, that require a great deal of mathematical and engineering know-how for obvious reasons.  Someone like you accepts the idea that &#8216;the Romans were backwards due to their awkward Roman numerals&rsquo; just because some liberal historian says so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matteo Ricci was the first Westerner to impress the Chinese, and he came in the late 1500s, a time by which China had clearly fallen behind the West. I seem to remember Marco Polo was impressed by the Chinese and not the other way around, and he only arrived 300 years previously.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have read accounts of Westerners going there much much earlier than that. And yes, of course, once again you swallow the leftist propaganda by reminding me of Marco Polo being impressed with China. People like you act as if he was over there copying scientific formulas or something of that nature. He was impressed with China&rsquo;s size and wealth, which I agree is impressive but at that same time Europe had more scientific knowledge stored away in Greek manuscripts.  Which is more important in the long run?</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re not right about the UN only being after White countries. in 2005, the UN released a damning report against racism in Japan. As far as I know no such report has been released against any White country save for France and Australia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, you are either only picking facts you wish to use or you are living life with your eyes closed.</p>
<p>And you admit that you support immigration?  Wow, you really are a liberal!</p>
<p>&#8220;Those two traits are not mutually exclusive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ummm yes they are, in many ways!</p>
<p>&#8220;I could present you with a list of some of the emerging technologies the Chinese are trying to develop, but I don&rsquo;t think that would convince you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, oh yes!  Things that COULD BE but that ARE NOT SO yet. Yes, that is what we should base China&rsquo;s technological prowess on, along with mythical, pc versions of history. </p>
<p>You mean like how they are supposed to have a colony on the moon now?  When will they make it to the moon?  Gosh we showed them how in the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So to sum my post up, now I see what you and liberal historians base things on when saying &#8220;China was so advanced compared to Europe&#8221;, but then again I already had my speculations before you even answered and it appears they have been confirmed. Now I have told you what I mean when I say Europe has always had more of what it took to create the modern world going back to the Greeks.  Now we need to decide which ideals are more important &#8220;bigger is better&#8221; OR  scientific thought and individualism.  For one, thing, I have never heard of Westerners trying to immigrate to China ever in history.</p>

		<p>Courtney from Alabama, I too am skeptical of many Chinese invention claims.  Many lack physical evidence or even drawings.  Most claims come from very brief, opaque descriptions in books.  As you mentioned, where is the evidence in foreign countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam for these Chinese inventions?  China had extensive interactions in these countries including immigration.  We see wholesale pottery techniques transported to Japan from China and Korea yet somehow the gun or printing press never reached Japan from China, the supposed home of these inventions.</p>

<p>Yet most people on this site source their supposed IQ figures claiming Whites and Asians from WN sources. Yet I never make any objection to where such figures come from and focus entirely on the flawed methodology used in such studies. Don&rsquo;t criticise the source Courtney, criticise the evidence. Basic critical thinking right there. If you won&rsquo;t accept entries from the Ming Shi-Lu or the records of Chinese foundries at Tianjin, then its up to you to decide that they are mere fabrications. I&rsquo;m not in a position to criticise you for doing that (though I think it rather foolish). I mean after all, they haven&rsquo;t been carbon dated so I guess its possible&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, now we are getting somewhere. I guess if we pick and choose what we wish to go by, it is easy for any historian to make it seem as if China was more advanced during a certain time. &#8220;</p>

<p>Perhaps you would care to name them? I think Matteo Ricci was the first to reach Beijing after Marco Polo, although many Muslims reached China before he did. The Portuguese reached Southern China, but never the capital. It&rsquo;s also rather strange that you say Marco Polo being impressed with China is &#8220;leftist propoganda&#8221;, yet you then admit to it being true.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Things that COULD BE but that ARE NOT SO yet.&#8221;<br>
They key word is yet. I might seem overly optimistic, but I think both of us will have to wait a while to see who is right in this respect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again, you are using the word &lsquo;superior&rsquo; based on your own pro-Asian biases, and by only going by what you want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the truest things you&rsquo;ve said. You see Courtney, I confess to taking a pro-Asian stance and regret it. The point of my posting on the site is not to put one race above the other, but to treat them as equal. I realise that in reacting to your post, I have taken up the &#8220;Asian cause&#8221;, and contradicted my original aim. I could counter with the impressive irrigation works of the Chinese or the establishment of Government sponsored schools at the same time as the Roman aqueducts, or else to try and counter your arguments, but this would be trying to put Asians above Whites, and I&rsquo;d hate to do that. Suffice it to say that two individuals with such opposing views cannot be reconciled&hellip; at least not within a single comments section. I&rsquo;d also ask you to examine your pro-White bias, as you speak as if my &#8220;pro-Asian bias&#8221; is a bad thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, you are either only picking facts you wish to use or you are living life with your eyes closed.&#8221;</p>
<p>No I don&rsquo;t believe I am. I haven&rsquo;t the time to find the reports about France and Australia, as they weren&rsquo;t well publicised. But the Diene Report in 2005 was well-known (in Japan at least).<br>
Unfortunately only versions in Japanese exist online; so I&rsquo;ll supply information and news about the report, rather than the text itself<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/6ya8r7d" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/6ya8r7d</a><br>
And yes Doudou Diene; the author is black, but I don&rsquo;t think that discredits him at all. Indeed intelligent black people got me thinking about my convictions&hellip; hence the &#8220;End to Illusion&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you find a report by the UN on racism in the USA or maybe another country I missed then please supply it. I shall be interested to scan through it myself.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you admit that you support immigration? Wow, you really are a liberal!&#8221;<br>
I&rsquo;m glad you picked it up. I&rsquo;m for immigration as long as its not illegal. Not really liberal from the mainstream side of things, but definitely further to the left on the political spectrum than you are.<br>
And you act as if its a crime. As I also stated my support isn&rsquo;t anti-White or anti-Asian&hellip; or pro-White or pro-Asian rather it&rsquo;s pro-human. Make of that what you will.</p>

You are both right.Chinese invention claims have about as much relevance as Egyptians taking credit for pyramids.Every European or American with a grain of common sense will see ancient marvels as heritage of lost civilizations.Contemporary peoples living amongst the ruins of these marvels are seen by Westerners as haphazard inhabitants of those lands.But this natural conclusion of Westerners is a concept not only alien but outright insulting to those peoples,even if it was wisdom and perception of Westerners to explore these marvels and explain to those peoples what exactly it is they live amongst.Manifestations of a cilization more often than not can outlive their creators by a long stretch of time.Just take a look around some quarters throughout the West and you will not see a trace of the creators of those quarters, now what to say about millenia. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that I&rsquo;m broadminded person. There are other sites of entirely different nature that I frequent, even more so than this one. By your logic I should say I am more much occupied with those sites than amren&hellip;</p>
<p>No, Courtney, I am obsessed with whites way less than you are with Asians considering some of your past postings&hellip; </p>
<p>Although a movement centered on racial (not to be confused with ethnic) characteristics certainly raises eyebrows, because as far as I know it is the only one of its kind in the world. (And Afrocentricism is just a spinoff in my honest opinion.) Now this is INTERESTING to say the least. To gage its success or failure I&rsquo;ll have to stay in the company of Father Time (as if I could help it) and keep myself abreast through outlets like this. I like amren btw.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your race isn&rsquo;t in the kind of danger that mine is in right now due to liberal multicultural policies. It says a lot about you that you would come on here and post a comment like that despite the circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please. Says a lot about me? What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean? So you believe the white race is in danger, yet you funnel your thought energy in a debate about whites vs asians? It&rsquo;s like a p*ssing contest. Is this really important SERIOUSLY? I fail to see a link between &#8220;whites are superior to non-whites&#8221; and &#8220;the white race is in danger.&#8221; Yeah I&rsquo;m a bit dull, did I miss something here?</p>
<p>Have a wonderful day everyone!<br>

<p>If I recall, the whole reason this debate started was because we were comparing achievements between China and the West. For some reason every time I bring up the West&rsquo;s advantages in historical achievements (which is glaringly obvious to the point it isn&rsquo;t worth debating), I am answered by posters such as yourself who  present me with presentations of how &#8216;China was more advanced up until 1500&rsquo;.  Even if that statement were true, how does it contradict my argument that the West has created more, and it is most certainly not just in recent history, either?</p>
<p>I have done my part in making my case and proving my point about the West&rsquo;s lopsided superiority when comparing quality and quantity of achievements, and people like you who I argue with always seem to have a hard time disputing it, so you go into the such and such dynasty of ages past and how it was superior to the West. Meanwhile, you aren&rsquo;t able to give me concrete examples of actual achievements that China developed during these long periods of &#8220;superiority&#8221;.  Even if you were able to, I could come back with a list 10 times as big showing European achievements during Europe&rsquo;s periods of superiority.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Yet most people on this site source their supposed IQ figures claiming Whites and Asians from WN sources. Yet I never make any objection to where such figures come from and focus entirely on the flawed methodology used in such studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow.  How is the methodology flawed?  And these are well known  geneticists who make these claims, and not &#8216;white nationalists&rsquo; you are speaking of here. How is their methodology flawed when they all do their own research and come up with similar results across time and using multiple examples from just about every people group and nation?</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t criticise the source Courtney, criticise the evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are accusing me of something because it is convenient for you to do so when I am actually doing just the opposite. Why do you think I criticize Wikipedia? It is run by liberals and any person is allowed to go on and supply information and edit posts. But oddly enough, this is the only &#8216;encyclopedia&rsquo; I have ever read that claims that Asians have produced an equal amount of science to whites. I encourage people to go to a library and read a REAL encyclopedia such as Britannica and many others. I also encourage people to read multiple books on the history of science.  I have done that very thing, and oddly enough, most of these books also come to similar conclusions to what I am saying&hellip;.. Whites have produced much more compared to other races in not just science, but math and technology as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you won&rsquo;t accept entries from the Ming Shi-Lu or the records of Chinese foundries at Tianjin, then its up to you to decide that they are mere fabrications. I&rsquo;m not in a position to criticise you for doing that (though I think it rather foolish).&#8221;</p>
<p>And what in the world could these Chinese sources say that is much different from what most Western historians say? Did all the evidence for China&rsquo;s supposed scientific paradise in the year 100 AD suddenly get erased?  Did it sink under the ocean or something?  What happened to it??????   There was an anonymous poster above who argued a very good point to you about &#8216;where is the evidence in China and surrounding Asian countries today?&rsquo; that you for some reason haven&rsquo;t responded to. </p>
<p>And I gave you a concrete example of a Western author with an Asian bias who used Asian sources in his work and STILL wasn&rsquo;t able to disprove that whites dominate historically in achievements!</p>
<p>I am not saying that other civilizations haven&rsquo;t contributed to world civilization.  I agree that China was impressive (going by certain criteria) at one time, and that India and the Middle East have made their own share of contributions.  However, for anybody to say that these other civilizations have been equal to white civilization when it comes to scientific achievements is just down right preposterous, and it is something that not one poster on here who has argued with me has been able to ever prove! Show me a list of arab achievements and I will show a list that is ten times long of Greek achievements!  Show me a list of Chinese inventions, and I can show you a list ten times longer coming out of a tiny European country like Germany!</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s also rather strange that you say Marco Polo being impressed with China is &#8216;leftist propoganda&rsquo;, yet you then admit to it being true.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are going to keep missing obvious points I am making then I am done discussing this with you. I never said that China wasn&rsquo;t impressive by certain parameters. What I was arguing about was, what was it exactly that we learned from China? As I said before, people like you act as if Europe became modern only because Marco Polo found some secret scientific codes over there that Europeans were too backwards to develop on their own. What was it exactly that Marco Polo brought back from China that Europe didn&rsquo;t already have?  </p>
<p>I have a book about Marco Polo. He mentioned how he was impressed with pottery and other crafts, large cities with organization, architecture and ships that were different but no more impressive than what Europe had, maybe gunpowder (the Greeks had gunpowder), spaghetti&hellip;&hellip;..but nowhere in the book does it talk about Marco Polo being impressed with scientific intellect or anything of that nature. As I said before, all civilizations can thrive on some form of math and technology, and I agree that China has been impressive when only looking at those things, but that in no way means that equal achievements have come out of China when compared to the West!!!!!!!</p>
<p>I think I am done. I can&rsquo;t believe we are even discussing this. The answer should already be obvious. I guess it is all in my head (and all of history&rsquo;s head) that Europeans have dominated in science, technology and math. Yes, of course. I guess we should also assume that India doesn&rsquo;t hold the monopoly on meditation, China doesn&rsquo;t have a monopoly on porcelain and silk production, or that the Middle East doesn&rsquo;t have a monopoly on woven carpets and textiles. We are never to suggest that any civilization is superior when looking at certain criteria (in my case scientific achievements) even when the facts are just the facts. I guess this is the liberal way of going about the world.</p>

<p>These Mickey Mouse contraptions you&rsquo;re referring to were no more than crude, inefficient novelties, designed mostly to scare enemies.  China, incidentally, &#8220;discovered&#8221; gunpowder by accident.  It took the West to expand the use of it to cannon and muskets.</p>
<p>You can reefer to this and that little incident in history all you want, but you can&rsquo;t argue with success.

&#8220;If I recall, the whole reason this debate started was because we were comparing achievements between China and the West. For some reason every time I bring up the West&rsquo;s advantages in historical achievements (which is glaringly obvious to the point it isn&rsquo;t worth debating), I am answered by posters such as yourself who present me with presentations of how &lsquo;China was more advanced up until 1500&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then allow me to rephrase it for you. they were equal. In fact I partly agreed with you in your first post.<br>
Quoting myself:<br>
&#8220;China would obviously not be where it was today. However, the West would be a bit lost without gunpowder and colonisation would have been a lot more difficult. China is playing catchup after centuries of stagnation. There will doubtless be many achievements in their own right within the next few decades.&#8221;</p>
<p>I merely said that China offered some things to the West (Undeniable) and that China is playing catchup (true again) and that there will be advances further along the track (debatable I suppose, but if you take issue with this claim, then your rebuttal should have focused on this point). But in a bout of overreaction, you seem to have thought I was pushing Asian supremacy; which I wasn&rsquo;t, and attacked my arguments quite viciously. I then responded by throwing arguments which I would not have put forward had I been a bit more aware of their implications; that Asians were superior to Whites; a fact I absolutely reject; starting an intense debate. This debate need not have happened if you took my initial post as it was intended; fact filled and relevant and not spun it into some sort of Asian propaganda machine. It would also have not happened if I clarified myself sooner. It was a pleasure sharing my views with you though, I must say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow. How is the methodology flawed?&#8221;<br>
Well Lynn only has the figures for 81 countries, and decides to average the figures of surrounding ones ti &#8220;fill in the gaps&#8221;. Some samples are also very small and hardly representative of an entire nation. China&rsquo;s IQ for example is overrated by such researchers as it is based on an IQ test conducted in Shanghai; a single city in a nation of over a billion. Columbia&rsquo;s figures come from an IQ test conducted within a single school district. Some nations have their IQs calculated by their PISA scores, others through using Raven&rsquo;s progressive matrixes. How can the authors of the study claim that their study is reliable when they have put together from many individual studies each compiled in a different way. Even if they apply statistical analysis to their results and scale the countries that have been assessed on an easier test down and those on a harder test up, they will never get a statistical portrait that is reliable. Further comments could be made about individual cases, as well as the scaling down of scores in Nigeria, but such criticism of studies (in particular IQ and the wealth of Nations and IQ and global inequality) would fill a book. I think you&rsquo;ll have to agree with me that Richard Lynn (the primary proponent of such studies) is WN, and he is a psychologist. The only geneticist to come forward about the issue was James Watson, and he merely expressed a view and never did a study in the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if that statement were true, how does it contradict my argument that the West has created more, and it is most certainly not just in recent history, either?&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t. But if &#8220;inventiveness&#8221; is genetic, then surely the West would have outpaced the East from the beginning?</p>
<p>&#8220;You are accusing me of something because it is convenient for you to do so when I am actually doing just the opposite. Why do you think I criticize Wikipedia? It is run by liberals&#8221;</p>
<p>The evidence I presented in my previous post were the Ming Shi-lu, the imperial archives of China from the mid-14th century down to the mid 17th, and the records of cannon foundries in Tianjin and across China. I have seen the former on microfilm, and although I haven&rsquo;t seen the records from the foundries, are relatively sure of their existence. I don&rsquo;t get my information from wikipedia. And believe it or not the Encyclopaedia Brittanica is rather a bit too liberal for your tastes too.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what in the world could these Chinese sources say that is much different from what most Western historians say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing. They say roughly the same things. I admitted in my previous post that I got a bit carried away defending and promoting Asians. My point is that up to 1500, Asians and Whites had the same standards of technology and other measures of social success. Africa lagged due to environmental constraints.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I gave you a concrete example of a Western author with an Asian bias who used Asian sources in his work and STILL wasn&rsquo;t able to disprove that whites dominate historically in achievements!&#8221;</p>
<p>I forgot to reply to that. He claimed that 90% of achievements made AFTER the Renaissance were by Whites, not before. And we were speaking of before the Renaissance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The answer should already be obvious. I guess it is all in my head (and all of history&rsquo;s head) that Europeans have dominated in science, technology and math.&#8221;<br>
Since 1500, of course. However, it was before the Renaissance that as being discussed. Something turned Europe into an intellectual superpower during this period, and its not merely revival of Greek and Latin texts.</p>
<p>I note that you have also failed to find a UN report against racism in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I am done.&#8221;<br>
Well I suppose that I am as well. I&rsquo;m sorry that this debate has caused such ill-will between us. I must admit though, that my views; completely free of racial agenda, unlike the occasional aggressive Asian poster on this site; must puzzle some people, as they don&rsquo;t attack them. <br>
I wish you all the best Courtney and hope to enjoy the rest of your day.</p>
<p>End to Illusion</p>
<p>AND TO POSTER 33:<br>
I&rsquo;m not exactly even sure what you&rsquo;re trying to get at. Maybe you think that the Ancient Chinese were White? I won&rsquo;t go into the logic of your argument, as in my mind, the fallacies in it speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Here we go again. How were they equal in achievements? ACHIEVEMENTS. Prove it. And don&rsquo;t blame me for causing you to sound like an Asian supremacist when you seemed to be happy to concede to me that Asians invented guns and that what Europe learned from China in 1300 was equal to what China has learned from us in 1800, or all of history for that matter.</p>
<p>As for your long paragraph explaining why you don&rsquo;t think the IQ research is plausible, all you did was take what I said and say just the opposite and how are we supposed to know what you are saying is accurate? I find many flaws in what you are saying. You are only picking and choosing what you want to go by. </p>
<p>As I said before, there isn&rsquo;t only one geneticist who is claiming all this. There are quite a few of them, and they have all published different books that reach similar conclusions. And all these conclusions are similar to research done in prior generations by earlier scientists. So you want to focus on the one or two countries that didn&rsquo;t have enough studies done for them and claim the entire research is innacurate based on this,  when the countries surrounding these countries have similar scores anyways and they themselves have enough reliable IQ tests to go by.</p>
<p>Look at overall averages, and stop focusing on little mistakes here and there. Just because Afghanistan for instance might not have reliable genetic tests done on it, this doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that the entire Middle East has a much lower IQ on average than Europe.  Look at the results of all the tests that have been done, instead of focusing on what has not been done and using that as your logic that &#8220;the tests are inaccurate&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t. But if &#8216;inventiveness&rsquo; is genetic, then surely the West would have outpaced the East from the beginning?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, we did when you look at scientific theories etc&hellip; going back to Greece.  Don&rsquo;t pick on Europe because we didn&rsquo;t have the advantage Asian civilizations had (including the Middle Eastern ones) when it came to abundant natural resources, lush river valleys, and favorable climates.  Europe was covered in ice longer than any other continent for goodness sake!  But despite all this, no Europe wasn&rsquo;t as big and &#8216;rich&rsquo; (I don&rsquo;t see how this means &#8216;better&rsquo;) as China was, but all along it had the knowledge needed to create the modern world eventually, meaning Europe always had much more innovative thinkers. From what I have seen about Rome on the History Channel, it looks like we got pretty close to creating the modern world earlier than we did.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;And believe it or not the Encyclopaedia Brittanica is rather a bit too liberal for your tastes too.&#8221;</p>
<p>In regards to what we are talking about, they do their research! As I said, most books that discuss the history of science seem to be preoccupied with Europe and less occupied with China. Unreliable (either that or biased) &#8216;encyclopedias&rsquo; such as Wikipedia are the only sources that like to claim that an equal amount of science came out of Asia as Europe&hellip;something that can never be proven because it just isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>&#8220;He claimed that 90% of achievements made AFTER the Renaissance were by Whites, not before. And we were speaking of before the Renaissance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, that is flat out not true, and you know it. He went all the way back to a certain BC date in his book and went into detail as to why he wasn&rsquo;t including achievements before that date (they were irrelevant). He included Ancient Greece in his book. After doing so, he stepped back and noticed that most of the achievements in all of history came after the Renaissance, but his charts even show a superior amount coming out of Greece during the BC period compared to China etc&hellip;.We are talking about achievements that matter and that led to the modern world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since 1500, of course. However, it was before the Renaissance that as being discussed. Something turned Europe into an intellectual superpower during this period, and its not merely revival of Greek and Latin texts.&#8221;</p>
<p>You keep wanting to say this but it isn&rsquo;t true. Any book I look at on the topic doesn&rsquo;t only show Europe after the Renaissance to be superior on this topic&hellip;..it also shows Ancient Greece to be superior. And then once you put in the achievements from Rome and the Middle Ages, Europe outnumbers the rest of the world by close to 90% (China, Middle East and India being the other 10%), which is much more than lopsided.  You can slice and dice it however you want to, but this is how the facts are presented.</p>
<p>&#8220;I note that you have also failed to find a UN report against racism in the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have to. What I am saying is already obvious. But since you want to nag like a liberal and focus on the one thing I haven&rsquo;t provided you and use that as a way of saying &#8216;Courtney lost the entire argument&rsquo; here you go&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>It appears that Courtney has a  deep seated inferiority complex regarding Asians because even WN researchers (Lynn, Rushton) have concluded that Asians on average have higher IQs than Whites (which I believe is simplistic; it&rsquo;s impossible to get representative samples of any race and conduct IQ tests with valid statistical controls if the objective is to measure inherited intelligence but I digress..).  Also, she resents the fact that certain Asian groups (Indians, Japanese, and perhaps the Chinese) seem to outperform Whites here in America, when measured by objective statistics such as academic scores, college graduation rates and average lifetime earnings.  Any stories commending Asians is met by a litany of excuses or some lenghthy reference to the historical achievements of Whites and diatribes on the inventions of Asians.  Ridiculously, the target of her anger is also a light hearted sitcom (Outsourced?) showing harmonious or even romantic relations between Whites and Asians!  </p>
<p>The problem is that employment or college admission decisions (which I suspect is the source of her real anger or frustration) cannot be made on the achievements of one&rsquo;s ancestors;  rather, for obvious reasons, decisions have to based on the quality of the candidate at hand today.  As such, I think WN like her should focus on improving their own abilities rather than delude themselves by thinking that there is a grand governmental conspiracy to put Whites down in their own respective homelands.  After all, Whites by definition are the majority in White countries, what is the upside for democratically elected Western governments to follow policies that are blatantly against the interests of their own citizens.  You are failing in the competition against Asians because they on average study harder, get better grades, graduate from college at higher rates, enter and exit graduate school at higher rates and thus make themselves more appealing in a relative sense to white collar employers.  No amount of diatribes or lengthy rants will ever change that!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come across your posts from time to time on AMREN. And, I must say you have a peculiar complex with Asians&hellip;.It&rsquo;s like I am listening to someone who&rsquo;s been neglected and underappreciated.</p>
<p>Okay, I am Chinese. If it lets you sleep better at night or make your day even, I am more than willing to applaud you, as a fine member of the white race, on your accomplishments and contributions. You and YOUR kind have made the world what it is today. I am utterly indebted to you. Heck, I am willing to throw all Chinese inventions over to the white race. You guys can have them. Whites are the most intelligent, the most creative, the most beautiful, the bravest, the superlatives. Oh I love that whites came up with ketchup too, and it&rsquo;s even red my favorite color. Drizzled on MacDonald&rsquo;s french fries&hellip;absolutely heavenly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, Chinese Anon, so we do have insecure, simpletons in our race but let&rsquo;s be honest so do you.  While I generally agree with the content of your ridicule towards Courtney, I  think your tone is uncalled for. Let&rsquo;s have a civilized debate and refrain from rubbing in the deficiencies of anybody&rsquo;s intellect so disparagingly in a public forum, notwithstanding how apparent those deficiencies may be. </p>

		<p>To the anonymous posters who decided to join the discussion this late (why don&rsquo;t you just pick a name for once, so that I can know whether or not I am speaking to the same person as before?):</p>
<p>Everything you went into hardly contradicts anything I have said. I agree that Asians have slightly higher IQs and that they do well on tests. What I disagree with is when people want to claim they have achieved as much as whites, because they most certainly haven&rsquo;t. It all has to do with differences in how their IQs are structured.</p>
<p>I find it amusing how posters such as yourselves feel the need to pop up out of nowhere and target me only when there are many others who say the same things I do. It shows me that you have issues with me as a poster as opposed to what I am actually saying. How weak and pathetic. Nice effort on trying to &#8220;stick it to me&#8221;. </p>
<p>You can come on here and harrass me as much as you want to but I am going to continue to state facts as much as I like. I am not going to change; sorry.</p>

<p>You know what Comrade Anonymous#39, I don&rsquo;t think a sitcom celebrating the outsourcing of American jobs to the utopia that is India is &ldquo;light hearted,&rdquo; at all. Particularly, since these are not jobs that they created for themselves, but are being handed to them, since they work at a cut rate of pay. Oh, are you ready to go into a &ldquo;litany of excuses&rdquo; as to why Indians are willing to work for lower pay or can&rsquo;t create such jobs for themselves?
