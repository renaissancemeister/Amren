			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Gardiner, Daily Star (London), January 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SERIAL killer Colin Ireland wants to become a Muslim  &mdash;  because he loves the curries they get fed in jail. </p>
<p>Evil Ireland, 56, even asked to be allowed to attend Friday prayers but was turned down. </p>
<p>The killer, who slaughtered five gay men, is now determined to convert to Islam from Christianity. </p>
<p>He told fellow inmates at Wakefield jail, West Yorkshire, his change of faith was sparked by spicy food. </p>
<p>A source said: &#8220;A love of curry must be the strangest reason ever to want to convert. </p>
<p>&#8220;Ireland really loves the vegetarian mushroom curries that are prepared mainly for the Muslim inmates in the prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;In his mind, the quality of the food has somehow got mixed up with Islam and the Muslim faith.&#8221; </p>
<p>The former soldier, who is caged on B-wing of the jail, put his name down for Friday prayers two weeks ago. </p>
<p>But governors rejected the application because he is a non-Muslim. </p>
<p>They think Ireland wants to convert for a cushy life. </p>
<p>Our source added: &#8220;They think Colin just wants a better lifestyle and this has little to do with religious beliefs. He can&rsquo;t believe how much better the food is for Muslim inmates.&#8221; </p>
<p>In June, Dame Anne Owers, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, wrote that some inmates had been converting to Islam to gain extra perks and protection. </p>
<p>All prisons offer a Halal menu, which some inmates regard as being better than the usual dishes on offer. </p>
<p>Muslims are also excused from work and education while attending Friday prayers. </p>
<p>In the report, one inmate, dubbed a &#8220;convenience Muslim&#8221;, is quoted as saying: &#8220;Food good too, initially this is what converted me.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ireland decided he would become a serial killer in a sick New Year resolution in 1993. </p>
<p>He tortured and killed the gay men he pretended to befriend. </p>
<p>Ireland was caught when he was identified by CCTV footage with his last victim. He confessed to having committed all five murders. </p>
<p>He was jailed at the Old Bailey in December 1993. </p>
<p>The judge at his murder trial, Mr Justice Sachs, said Ireland was &#8220;exceptionally frightening and dangerous&#8221;.</p>
<p>He is one of only 35 prisoners to have been given a whole life tariff by a Home Secretary. <br>

		<p>This is a common ploy in British jails, and accounts for many of the &#8216;Muslim converts&rsquo; therein.  The ethnic Muslims see it for what it is - a way of getting a decent curry (which, to a Brit, is as much a right as an American&rsquo;s access to decent Mexican food), and can get shirty about it.  As a statement of belief it&rsquo;s no more sincere than when convicts used to attend chapel and hymn services in exchange for tea, buns, and the occasional pretty face assisting the vicar.</p>

		<p>Gosh, whites are willing to sell their heritage for a plate of curry!  No wonder Muslims are contemptuous of the West.</p>
