			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarah Crawford, NT News (Darwin, Northern Territory), January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A SHOPPING centre manager has lifted the lid on &#8220;Darwin&rsquo;s dirty secret,&#8221; saying a large amount of human faeces is washed on to the city streets every day. </p>
<p>The manager of Fannie Bay shops, who asked not to be named, said he was using a fire hose up to three times a day to wash the poo from concrete footpaths.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just push it on to the street and the public walks in it every day. It is a dirty secret in Darwin,&#8221; he told the Northern Territory News.</p>
<p>He said it was not just Fannie Bay that had the problem, but also Parap, Stuart Park and in the &#8220;nooks and crannies,&#8221; at all shops around Darwin.</p>
<p>Lisa Johnston, who works at Fannie Bay cafe the Cool Spot, said she smelled it every time she got to work at 6 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, &#8220;just after they have finished hosing it down&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is pretty rank in the morning,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Port Darwin MLA John Elferink has also noticed the proliferation of poo around Parap. On Saturday morning he found it outside his office.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found four little deposits along the back - it is just gross,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He also found excrement in Parap car park.</p>
<p>Mr Elferink said he had complaints from real estate agents and local residents in the past week.</p>
<p>Itinerants were being blamed for the extra excrement this wet season. Many had moved their camps under the cover of shops to escape the rain.</p>
<p>At Fannie Bay shops about 20 people have moved in to Keith Lane, complete with mattresses, pillows and sheets, over the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Mr Elferink said Darwin City Council should re-examine its policy of closing public toilets at night.</p>
<p>But the Fannie Bay shops manager said the real issue was that the council was not enforcing its by-laws by cracking down on illegal campers and fining them.</p>
<p>Darwin City Council chief executive Brendan Dowd said council officers did not fine indigenous homeless people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their financial circumstances mean they have little capacity to pay a fine,&#8221; Mr Dowd said.</p>
<p>Instead the council was working with police to increase patrols in the area.</p>
<p>Poo is not a new problem for Darwin. In July the NT News reported council rangers were cleaning up human faeces from parks several times a day.</p>
<p>Mr Dowd said the council was reviewing its policy on closing public toilets at night.</p>
<p>The NT Government was also in the process of seeking further funding for the &#8220;Return to Country&#8221; program to help people presently stranded in Darwin return to their communities.<br>

		<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a moral failing of mine. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m on a &#8216;preservation&rsquo; website, but I couldn&rsquo;t help wonder about race reading this article. Am I more racist if I wonder or more racist if I pretend not to wonder (I&rsquo;m sure the smart-people would tell me I&rsquo;m racist, either way). Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to live in a country where you wouldn&rsquo;t have to wonder if race was involved or not and what your reaction should be?</p>

		<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Australia is looking at ponying up the better part of 3.5 billion AUD for 14 F-35 fighter jets for delivery in 2014 (with hopes for about 58 more by 2020) &#8216;in case Jakarta starts some funny business&rsquo; but cannot buy enough Helicopters, UAVs and Range Rovers to keep it&rsquo;s aboriginal population on the reservation?  </p>
<p>Tell me, do they poo in the open there as well?</p>
<p>What would happen if you did like we did here with indigents: giving them a cash allotment, 3/4s of which went to rent in a nice apartment which was inspected once a month with the requirement that they keep their room clean and their bodies well kempt &#8216;or it&rsquo;s out on the street and off to jail and no more money&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Given Darwin gets to 31.8`C average daytime temp in January (that&rsquo;s 89.2`F), I can&rsquo;t imagine that it gets much less &#8216;nosier&rsquo; as the day goes on.</p>
<p>Robot pooper scoopers?  A portapotty?  Do you have something like zoning laws or community convenants?<br>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that these &#8220;itinerants&#8221; (probably Aboriginals) are doing this in a city called Darwin?  Evidently evolution isn&rsquo;t quite universal.  I am of the understanding that Australian Aboriginals were one of the very few sorts of people who did not figure out on their own that human sexuality leads to pregnancy and eventually childbirth;  They did not make the connection until the first white settlers taught them.</p>

		<p>The original article is no more clear than this.  If the people doing this are homeless due to the flood and the city is closing down the public toilets at night perhaps the solution is to keep the public toilets open at night.  Perhaps I am missing something but this, while gross, seems to be more a case of circumstances than the regular behavior of certain elements of Australian society.</p>

		<p>This is not just restricted to Darwin of course.  When I was in Sydney some years ago, I&rsquo;d stopped by a supermarket to pick up a few things for my trip home and as I was lined up at the checkout, there was an Aboriginal (if I can call them that, because it depends how they feel on the day) in the process of leaving excrement just inside the automatic doors.  I did question the young lady about what the hell was going on, and she nodded and said that they were quite use to it happening.  It had nothing to do with the fact that they locked certain public toilets, because there was bush land not so far away, (about 10-15 mins walk) in the particular suburb that I was in.  If that had have been me doing that, in any public area for all the world to see, I would have been arrested immediately and a court date set for indecent exposure, and desecration of public property.  (Not that I would do such a thing.)  Oh, but don&rsquo;t forget, I am not a part of a protected minority.</p>

		<p>Long has the race card been called in such situations. We as Non-Indigenous are critisised for upholding decency in society, and are accused of being racist when we point out the obvious.  Its about time that equality was truly enforced and the indigenous of this country are held accountable to the laws as laid out by the majority in this country, instead of hiding behind THEIR colour and cultural heritage. We must all move with the times and advance as people, Indigenous and Non-Indigenous alike.</p>

		<p>Even without access to public toilets, it sounds like these unnamed but apparent Australoids are fouling their own nests.  Most animals don&rsquo;t relieve themselves where they eat and sleep, but you hear about low-IQ humans doing it regularly  &mdash;  whether on the streets of African cities or in NYC.  <br>
And I wonder why the public toilets are closed at night in Darwin.  No doubt it has to do with other activities of Australoids.</p>

		<p>Some answers to  #1 - #10!</p>
<p>Give them a nice new apartment, it would be destroyed in hours.Give them welfare housing of any sort out in the bush, they will destroy it including pulling up the floor for firewood.<br>
Access to toilets after hours? No way they become drug dens and places for sex, rape and other assults.</p>
<p>In parts of NSW where I work it is possible to see whole towns destroyed by Aboriginal looting, arson and vandalism. You just dont go out onto the streets at night in places such as Moree, Walgett and Bourke.Businesses just shutter up at about 5pm.</p>
<p>The City of Cairns in Qld which has a lot of tourists actually removes drunken &amp; degenerate aboriginals from the Esplanade so they will not offend visitors (mainly Asian). A victory for comonsense but the do-gooders cry &#8220;racism&#8221;</p>
<p>A Federal politician here quite recently said &#8220;Trying to help Aboriginals is a bit like the job of cleaning the toilets on the Titanic!&#8221; (The do-gooders were furious about this very public statement) </p>
<p>But back to toilets, proper waste disposal is an essential part of any modern society, without it our towns and cities would be uninhabitable. I find it strange that the Aboriginals will come to town to get their Welfare payments, buy junk food and alcohol but they dont understand what a toilet is, or choose not to use it.</p>
<p>Of course pouring money into the problem and trying to pretend that these people are just like us does not work, same as it does not work in your country.</p>

		<p>Aboriginal neighbourhoods out here in rural N.S.W are mini-Detroits. Back in my old town of Dubbo, N.S.W, there&rsquo;s an area over the railway tracks that used to be called the &#8216;Gordon Estate&rsquo; (people nicknamed it &#8216;Vegie Valley&rsquo; or &#8216;The Bronx&rsquo;) where half of the houses in the area are burned down, boarded up, or have been torn down leaving only an empty lot. Compare and contrast to the rustbelt on Google Earth and you&rsquo;ll see striking similarities with Detroit.</p>
