<h1>Award Against Ex-Klan Chief Reversed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Kenning, Courier-Journal (Louisville, Kentucky), January 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Kentucky Court of Appeals reversed a $1.3 million civil judgment against the former leader of Kentucky-based Imperial Klans of America on Friday, ruling that there isn&rsquo;t enough evidence to hold him liable in the beating of a minority teen by other Klansmen at a county fair.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the victim, 19-year-old Jordan Gruver, argued at a 2008 trial that Ron Edwards, then the Klan group&rsquo;s Imperial Wizard, recklessly bred an atmosphere of hate and violence and should be held liable in Gruver&rsquo;s July 2006 beating.</p>
<p>A Meade County jury agreed, granting a $2.5 million civil judgment against IKA member Jarred Hensley and Edwards, whom the jury held liable for $1.3 million of that amount. Two other assailants settled out of court with Gruver.</p>
<p>On Friday, a three-judge panel threw out that judgment, ruling that &#8220;there was no evidence that Edwards had encouraged or instructed any of the assailants to go to the fair&#8221; and &#8220;no evidence that he had encouraged or instructed the assailants&#8221; to assault Gruver.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which represented Gruver, said his group would ask the Kentucky Supreme Court to reinstate the verdict.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Depending on what the Kentucky Supreme Court decides, the case could be retried in Meade County. Cohen said his group hadn&rsquo;t decided whether to pursue another trial.</p>
<p>Since the trial, the IKA, once the nation&rsquo;s second-largest Klan group with 39 chapters in 26 states, has dwindled to two chapters, the law center said.</p>

<p>Strange, isn&rsquo;t, that this liberal fanatic hasn&rsquo;t defended one white person against 100&rsquo;s of black on white attacks that occur annually, since he claims to pursue court cases for the sake of justice?</p>
<p>But, without do-gooder whites on the jury he couldn&rsquo;t be effective.  The decision a jury made in the case of a rancher on the border who confronted illegals was especially shameful, particularly since he was just defending his family and property against intimidation, threats, and thefts from illegals. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Recklessly breeding an atmosphere of hate and violence&#8221; seems to be the latest extralegal accusation flung against White men who have no real connection at all to Crimes Against Diversity.  And <i>only</i> against White men.  Blacks and browns, of course, are incapable of stirring up &#8220;hate and violence,&#8221; even when they&rsquo;re screaming &#8220;get Whitey&#8221; as the fists, knives and guns do their job.</p>

		<p>The thing this Mr Cohen doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand, is that this nation is about individuality. About being responsible for your actions. Not other peoples actions.. and this nation should remain this way. We don&rsquo;t need communist reform in this land of the free and home of the brave. I cant help but see something hideous in souls like Mr. Cohen. We don&rsquo;t need to be emasculated here.. or deprived of thinking or saying anything we believe true and are willing to live and die for. The Constitution is who we are&hellip;. not Richard Cohen and his group.</p>

		<p>Fascinating to see quite how systematically the Leftists are attempting to attack freedom of speech. At any opportunity they seek to either make their opponents self censor or else, if that fails, abuse legal processes to destroy people.</p>

		<p>What was the kid doing there and what were the three men doing there?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve Googled but not discovered anything beyond &#8216;racial epithets and whiskey dousing&rsquo; as explanations for why the confrontation began.</p>
<p>If it happened at an ongoing State or County Fair, I have a -very- hard time believing that three men with families actually picked a fight with an underage minor _no matter what he looked like_, in front of witnesses.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s not like the SPLC stalks white nationalist groups or anything&hellip;  Aryan Nations, The K, there seems to be a definite agenda of depriving whites of the organization necessary to give them a viable political or defensive position.  Not just by direct attack on the more controversial groups but by implication that only whites do this.  And (according to the article) &#8216;it&rsquo;s really a for-proft driven enterprise&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>There are already numerous Federal (and probably Kentucky state) laws about RICO, corrupt organizations, mob action, etc., both on the civil and criminal end, that could be used in this case IF there was a case.  But there does not seem to be a case.  Except there is a &#8220;case&#8221; of the SPLC needing a legal victory/someone&rsquo;s scalp in order to keep the ever-dwindling donor base impressed.</p>
