<h1><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-stranahan/blue-dog-congressman-sanf_b_812884.html">Blue Dog Congressman Sanford Bishop Knew About <i>Pigford</i> Fraud</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lee Stranahan, Huffington Post, January 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While I was conducting a video interview with a Georgia farmer named Eddie Slaughter a couple of weeks ago, he made a surprising and stunning allegation: that he had told his congressman about fraud in the multibillion dollar Pigford v. Glickman settlement and that the congressman responded by telling him that an investigation into Pigford would &#8220;shut it down.&#8221; Mr. Slaughter&rsquo;s congressman  &mdash;  a man you may not have heard much about despite his nearly two decades as a Blue Dog Democrat and Congressional Black Caucus member  &mdash;  is Sanford Bishop.</p>
<p>I followed up with Mr. Slaughter and I asked him if others were in the meeting with Congressman Bishop. I&rsquo;ve since interviewed two of those farmers  &mdash;  one on the phone and one, farmer Willie Head, on video. Both confirmed Mr. Slaughter&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a a segment of my interview with Mr. Slaughter where he says: <blockquote>We went to him [Sanford Bishop] several times about this fraud. [We asked] &#8216;why don&rsquo;t you have them tell you how many of these people that are getting this money have an actual farm ID number and are actual farmers?&rsquo; [Bishop responded] &#8216;no, no, no  &mdash;  man, they&rsquo;ll shut this thing down.&rsquo;<br>
</blockquote>And here is Willie Head:<blockquote>I posted these videos to my YouTube account and then wrote pieces for Andrew Breitbart&rsquo;s BigGovernment.com site. The controversial Mr. Breitbart is funding the documentary I&rsquo;m working on but has given me complete journalistic freedom and has had no direct involvement in shooting any of the more than 12 hours of video interviews I&rsquo;ve done so far. As a liberal, I disagree with Breitbart on most issues, but I also found him to be a very different person than he&rsquo;s been portrayed as in the media, and working with him has been a great experience, just like my previous work for MoveOn.org and Brave New Films. I also don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s a racist. If he were, I wouldn&rsquo;t be working with him.<br>
</blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} More damning for Congressman Bishop, of course, is that he confirmed to two of the newspapers that he was indeed aware of fraud in the Pigford case. This is from the Albany Herald piece:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am aware that there is fraud in the program, that&rsquo;s why anti-fraud provisions were written into the settlement,&#8221; Bishop said Thursday morning. &#8220;My job was to help secure funding for constituents who had been discriminated against by the USDA. It&rsquo;s not my job to monitor fraud in the program. I can&rsquo;t assume responsibility for fraud. You can&rsquo;t lay that at my feet.</p>

damage control.</p>
<p>I read the comments at Huffpost  and though they all bemoaned the corruption found none could get it up to say that there is a certain fear in the land to question anything having to do with blacks and corruption.</p>

Why is this newsworthy? It as about as newsworthy as declaring:water is wet.  The United States government has huge on and off the book programs designed to enrich their chosen constiuency.  The biggest scam is run by the Federal Reserve it&rsquo;s called Permanent Open Market Operations:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/article/xtranormal-cartoon-explains-pomo" rel="nofollow">https://www.zerohedge.com/article/xtranormal-cartoon-explains-pomo</a></p>
<p>This program and quantitative easy has resulted in the Fed&rsquo;s balance books expanding to over two trillion dollars.</p>
<p>In light of the trillions going to all sorts of questionable activities is it any wonder that American citizens want a few crumbs from the table of government largesse?  Would anyone say it&rsquo;s wrong when we have such small well transfer programs when we have Social Security and Medicare transferring far more to fellow citizens our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq combined?  Note that there is no savings account for social security Trust Fund Money and it&rsquo;s run alot like Enron.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3439" rel="nofollow">https://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3439</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going say it&rsquo;s wrong to criticise this program but I do think we should look keep it perspective with the federal government&rsquo;s</p>

		<p>Give some credit to the HuffPo- even though they tried to spin Bishop as a Blue Dog (i.e. conservative) Democrat.</p>
<p>The dead giveaway that this whole thing is a scam is that the first Pigford handout took place during Clinton&rsquo;s second term and Pigford 2 happened over a decade later during the Obama regime.</p>
<p>In other words the slimy lawyers didn&rsquo;t dare demand Pigford 2 when a Republican was in the White House for the intervening 8 years.   </p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s as if the whole concept of black farmer discrimination was invented by the Clinton administration as a back door reparation program, a social experiment designed by white guilt liberals, &#8220;lets give 100,000 black families $50,000 cash and see what happens&#8221; it follows the now disastrous &#8220;let&rsquo;s give every black family a house&#8221; social experiment.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve gotta get in on this scam!  Hell, I can claim that several generations ago my gene-pool was at extreme low tide and actually featured a black man (or woman).  And my 1.5 acre residential property is indeed a farm, having once hosted some tomato vines lovingly cultivated in tribute to the agrarian forefather (or mother) in the family tree</p>

===========================================</p>
<p>Just look at Africa. I bet most people there don&rsquo;t have a clue about what their country is called this year or its history.</p>
<p>As for blacks here - politicians or not - most are out to scam what they can and then goof off or hang out the rest of the day. They contribute nothing but take, take, take. And believe me, most could not care at all if this country collapses - as long as some tight shoes and a warm bed and cheap liquor is available. </p>
<p>Of course, they will miss all the conveniences and inventions that whites have provided them but in a generation or two they will forget and think America always looked like Detroit.</p>
<p>Remember, you are talking about a race with no loyalty even to its own people - who behave like animals out for feeding and breeding. They kill their own family members over pieces of chicken. Do you really think they care about America?</p>

		<p>While Eric Holder is in charge of criminal prosecutions, it will remain open season for his tribesmen to raid the U.S. treasury.  The justification for looking the other way at endemic fraud can be summed up in one word:  reparations.</p>

		<p>There is one easy way to check this. The USDA has flown aerial photography of all of the counties of the US since at least 1951. These flights are repeated every few years and were used I believe to check on allotment acreages for cotton, corn, etc.</p>
<p>All one has to do is find out which landowners claim to have been farmers and look at their property on these photos to see if there were indeed ANY farm activities.</p>
<p>The anti-fraud provisions should provide a way for private citizens to double check on all who received checks or have claims pending. Give the investigators 10% of the money recovered and you&rsquo;ll see much of the fraud disappear.</p>
<p>By the way if you want to check up on anyone, your local tax assessor&rsquo;s office, USDA office, or university map library should have these photos available for at least 50 years into the past. </p>

		<p>@ttowntony,</p>
<p>Brilliant idea.</p>
<p>There is a site called historicaerials.com that has a lot of those flyover images since the 50&rsquo;s that you mention.</p>
<p>As far as the other thing goes, I have yet to see a black politician that hasn&rsquo;t perpetrated some shameless and clumsy bit of corruption.  But that community reelects crack addicts. What can you do?</p>

		<p>@14 Phil,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
What can you do?<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Punish the confidence artists for fraud.  If nobody black dares to go to Big Government to get a little piece for themselves, these black shysters in office will lose their powerbase.</p>
<p>You can talk antideficiency, misuse of funds and out and out fraud until you are blue in the face.  Yet the fact is that the U.S. Legislature will cover for it&rsquo;s own rather than create a precedent of legal accountability to the people.  The last thing government wants is to be held to a standard of efficiency or honesty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those &#8216;not the man but the office of&rsquo; conditions where gaffing the criminal makes all the other criminals nervous.</p>
<p>But if you _hurt the constituency_ you hurt the agenda by which these scam artists get in on the notion of &#8216;black issues&rsquo; as an implicit victimization-reparation strategy.</p>
<p>And that is ultimately what you want to shut down anyway.  Ignore the 100,000 new claimants for Pigford.  13% of 300 million is 39 million.  Vs. what, 20 men in the Congressional Black Caucus?</p>
<p>Who hurts us more?  Whom do you want to shame so badly that -nobody- trusts their public image anymore?</p>
<p>I stand by whoever suggested a 10% bounty reward on every man, woman and child who is proven to be fraudulently applying to this supposed unfair loan practices fund.</p>
<p>And I think we should do it -after- the money is handed out so we can both render the criminal penalties more explicit and make it clear how many Escalades and other unnecessary bling our money was immediately wasted on.</p>
<p>What we need is a rich white man to make it happen with a core of about 10,000 insurance adjustor type experts to put together an easy search filter with.</p>
<p>And then publish the results on a huge website.</p>
<p>&#8216;Pigford = Hogs In Slop.com&rsquo; sounds about right.</p>

I strongly disagree with the insinuation and open claim that black politicians are more openly corrupt.  Take senator Phil Gram for instance his wife ended up sitting on the board of Enron and he himself gets a cushy high paying job at UBS.  He was also a sponsor the Commodity Future Modernization Act of 2000 which helped benefit Enron,a company where his wife was sitting on the board of directors:</p>
<p>https://www.villagevoice.com/2002-01-15/news/phil-gramm-s-enron-favor/</p>
<p>Of course let&rsquo;s not forget that after regulating the banking industry Phil Gramm gets a nice job making millions with the very people who he oversaw and helped to create some terrible problems:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slate.com/id/2194933/" rel="nofollow">https://www.slate.com/id/2194933/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/phil-gramm-and-the-ubs-tax-case/" rel="nofollow">https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/phil-gramm-and-the-ubs-tax-case/</a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget the Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin who again gets a cushy high paid job making millions working for the very people he was suppose to regulate as Secretary of Treasury:</p>
<p>https://blogs.alternet.org/speakeasy/2010/09/09/citibank-will-anyone-hold-prince-and-rubin-accountable/</p>
<p>Looking at Graham and Rubin I think any sort of crimes commited by black political officials are breath taking, in the sense that the monies are so small and the effects so utterly inconsequential.  If anything black politicians should be lectured at length about their inability to game and loot the system nearly half as well as their white peers. The people running this country into the ground are not the people who are only out to steal a few billion from the government,it&rsquo;s the people who stealing trillions of dollars and destroying the entire financial system that are destroying America.  <br>
