<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/08/us/08ethnic.html?_r=2">Rift in Arizona as Latino Class Is Found Illegal</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marc Lacey, New York Times, January 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The class began with a Mayan-inspired chant and a vigorous round of coordinated hand clapping. The classroom walls featured protest signs, including one that said &#8220;United Together in La Lucha!&#8221;  &mdash;  the struggle. [Nearly] all of those attending Curtis Acosta&rsquo;s Latino literature class on a recent morning were Mexican-American. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For all of that and more, Mr. Acosta&rsquo;s class and others in the Tucson Unified School District&rsquo;s Mexican-American program have been declared illegal by the State of Arizona  &mdash;  even while similar programs for black, Asian and American Indian students have been left untouched.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s propagandizing and brainwashing that&rsquo;s going on there,&#8221; Tom Horne, {snip}.</p>
<p>For the state, the issue is not so much &#8220;The Tempest&#8221; as some of the other texts used in the classes, among them, &#8220;The Pedagogy of the Oppressed&#8221; and &#8220;Occupied America,&#8221; which Mr. Horne said inappropriately teach Latino youths that they are being mistreated. </p>

		<p>The teaching of such anti-American fabrications amounts to sedition, and if there were ever rhetoric that had the potential to cause violence this is it, right along with what is taught to other non-whites, as the article points out.</p>

		<p>Below is a link to a good, brief video on Tucson&rsquo;s &ldquo;ethnic studies&rdquo; course. It features a former ethnic studies teacher in the district, John Ward, who is of Hispanic heritage.</p>
<p>This little report serves admirably as a shorthand model for understanding &ldquo;ethnic studies&rdquo; as a curriculum category.  &ldquo;Ethnic studies&rdquo;  have proliferated across American &ldquo;higher&rdquo; education: </p>

		<p>Then, one young woman asked Mr. Acosta how he was holding up. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They wrote a state law to snuff this program out, just us little Chicanitos,&rdquo; he said, wiping away tears. &ldquo;The idea of losing this is emotional.&rdquo; </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kind of emotional too, about losing our country.</p>

The class began with a Mayan-inspired chant and a vigorous round of coordinated hand clapping. The classroom walls featured protest signs, including one that said &ldquo;United Together in La Lucha!&rdquo; &mdash; the struggle. [Nearly] all of those attending Curtis Acosta&rsquo;s Latino literature class on a recent morning were Mexican-American. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Sounds like blacks who can&rsquo;t learn sophisticated philosophic conceptual dialogue as a function of balanced logic and rationalism and so resort to rote mimicry as &#8216;a musical number&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Classic period Mayan (900AD-250AD) culture is indeed associated with the Mexican Yucatan peninisula and specifically Chichen Itza but the cultural heart of the society goes much farther back to pre-Classic (2,600-3,100) Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador.  None of whom have much, culturally, in common with Mexico of either period or even today.</p>
<p>While noteable in some ways, for the sole written language of the Americas and the Long Count calendar, the Maya also were a barbaric people who sacrificed their prisoners of battle by noosing them and throwing them off the cliff edges of natural sinkholes (and their sole fresh water supply) in the capital and elsewhere.  Even when the heads didn&rsquo;t come off, you can well imagine what a hanged person&rsquo;s end does to the potability of the water.  When a new monument was being dedicated, it was also common to cut the hearts out of multiple young children to propitiate the building sequence.  Wonderful people.</p>
<p>Something we hadn&rsquo;t been doing since Etruscan times (ca. 800BC).</p>
<p>While Mayan culture is even more ancient than this, what marks it is the -lack- of continuing development beyond such barbaric actions and indeed the noteable lack of a burgeoning engineering culture to support their growth (no domestication/herding, no shipbuilding, no useful wheel, no metallurgy to speak of&hellip;) for the entire period.</p>
<p>Though the Mayans, in terms of feral behavior, are themselves nothing when compared to the subsequent Aztec culture with their specific (and multiple) death cult rituals for just about every occasion, their supremacist subjugation of surrounding tribal cultures did much to cause the Maya to be feared and hated.</p>
<p>Today, Mexican troops routinely beat and/or kills illegal Indian immigrants from these &#8216;Mayan&rsquo; (yes, the languages are still spoken so it&rsquo;s consider a living culture) states as the darkest of the color continuum with whom they wish to have no contact, economic, cultural or otherwise.</p>
<p>Maybe if these little precious darlings were taught the reality of a cultural heritage with whom the majority have no link, modern or otherwise, &#8216;La Lucha&rsquo; would be seen as what it is: a struggle to escape brutally antagonistic, aboriginal, past.</p>
<p>A struggle which they failed to win.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
To buttress his critique of the Tucson program, Mr. Horne read from texts used in various classes, which in one instance referred to white people as &ldquo;gringos&rdquo; and described privilege as being related to the color of a person&rsquo;s skin, hair and eyes. He also cited the testimony of five teachers who described the program as giving a skewed view of history and promoting racial discord. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>At which point we could shift topics to why modern Mexico is a racist plantation in which the 10% of whitest-skinned elites run a society based on croneyism and unfair service and industrial monopolies that make them wealthy at the cost of &#8216;loyal Mexicans&rsquo; who can&rsquo;t wait to jump States and start the same process, here in America.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
On the first day of school, they are no different than students in any other classes,&rdquo; said John Ward, who briefly taught a Latino history class in Tucson. &ldquo;But once they get told day after day that they are being victimized, they become angry and resentful.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Augustine F. Romero, director of student equity in the Tucson schools, said the program was intended to make students proud of who they are and not hostile toward others. &ldquo;All of our forefathers have contributed to this country, not just one set of forefathers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We respect and admire and appreciate the traditional forefathers, but there are others.&rdquo; <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>No there aren&rsquo;t.  Certainly not hispanic ones.  And the desire to foster an identity that doesn&rsquo;t exist to-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&ldquo;Who are the true Americans here  &mdash;  those embracing our inalienable rights or those trying to diminish them?&rdquo; <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Is nothing less than a rewrite of history to justify invasion and conquest.</p>
<p>Arizona ethnic studies, as presented, are nothing but race baiting propaganda as the precursor to militant revolutionism.  And you can always tell that this is so when a present culture is so historically poor and present-tense ignorant that it has to rely on a murky past to justify current failures across the modern Latino world.</p>
<p>And their hostile, unwanted, presence in ours.</p>

		<p>Teaching Latino youths that they&rsquo;re being mistreated. Give me a break! What other country but the United States provides Section 8 vouchers, food stamps, free school breakfasts and lunches and a whole array of other free stuff to people here legally AND illegally. No other. And yet this is the brainwashing tripe taught to them. Real nice.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s propagandizing and brainwashing that&rsquo;s going on there,&rdquo;: I agree with this statement, but then, what do we call it when we say the pledge of allegiance daily in our school classrooms? How about when we learn/memorize our National Anthem at an early age?  I would say that much of our learning and life training is at some level a combination of propaganda and brainwashing and that the debate is more a concern of just what material and point of view we are going to use, and to whom we are going to teach it. The point I&rsquo;m trying to make, is that this article shows the essence of why multiculturalism is such a failure.  I would like to see every child grow up to be proud of who they are, but come short of thinking they are better than others. That Mexican children are taught to be proud to be Mexican is, I believe, a fine thing, but if Mr. Horne (or anyone else) objects to this teaching, just what is it that he feels they should be taught, that Mexicans are losers who can&rsquo;t run their own country?  That White people in the 1840&rsquo;s kicked their forefathers out of the Southwest and they just have to deal with it? What? Anyway, articles such as this show the increasing disjointedness within our society, and if anything, brings to light the -need- for humans to have ethno-centric nations to call their own.</p>

		<p>People should be vigilant for poisons like this. I would be the first to record it and share it with publications like American Renaissance.  We have to expose these things that are hidden in the shadows of American classrooms. They are ubiquitous in certain regions of the country.       </p>

		<p>&#8220;just what is it that he feels they should be taught, that Mexicans are losers who can&rsquo;t run their own country? That White people in the 1840&rsquo;s kicked their forefathers out of the Southwest and they just have to deal with it? What?&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I agree with the essential message of  your post. <br>
But I want to set something straight: We did NOT &#8220;kick their forefathers of of the Southwest&#8221;. </p>
<p>In fact, at that time there were very, very few Mexicans in the Southwest, which was mostly barren,  uninhabited desert. No  Mexicans wanted to be there. Even California, the most populated, had only several thousand. What population existed were Indian tribes who did not want, like, (or consider themselves) to be &#8220;Mexicans&#8221; either.  Whites came in, brought irrigation, railroads, and investment,  and made the desert bloom. And then the Mexicans followed, much later,  attracted like bees to honey by the new wealth.</p>
<p>Few to none of these Mexicans had any &#8220;forefathers&#8221; present in the Southwest at that time. That&rsquo;s an utter myth!  They are all immigrants, whether legal or illegal. Many of them come from the South of Mexico, completely remote from the territory or history of the Southwest. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get history straight. Their forefathers had nothing to do with the Southwest. What they are trying to do is grab a territory they never had. This is raw Mexican imperialism! Why should we stand for it?  Putting up with this nonsense in the name of tolerance and diversity is pure madness.</p>

		<p>I work with a lot of latino youth as part of my job, and they are CONSTANTLY being brainwashed by their activists.  It&rsquo;s crazy sometimes.</p>
<p>They are told that America is oppressing them (meanwhile they get free education, free health care, free food, etc).</p>
<p>They are told that they have &#8216;rights&rsquo; to basically be given a middle class lifestyle, without working for it for generations like the rest of us did.</p>
<p>They are told a lot of socialist, Che Guevara stuff about social justice, the fight against the evil old white imperialists, etc. IN OUR LAND.</p>
<p>Finally they are told over and over that white people are dying away and that it is their destiny to take over this nation.</p>
<p>Some of the worst people pushing this are liberal socialist whites.  I see it all the time where I&rsquo;m at.  Us older workers who are still American in our mindset are appalled DAILY.</p>
