<h1>Letter from a Friend  &mdash;  Unpleasant Truth and a Serious Warning That Politicians Will Just Ignore Because of Political Correctness</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frosty Wooldridge, Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville), January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For 15 years, from the mid 1970&rsquo;s to 1990, I worked in Detroit, Michigan. I watched it descend into the abyss of crime, debauchery, gun play, drugs, school t truancy, car-jacking, gangs, and human depravity. I watched entire city blocks burned out. I watched graffiti explode on buildings, cars, trucks, buses, and school yards. Trash everywhere!</p>
<p>Detroiters walked through it, tossed more into it, and ignored it. Tens of thousands, and then hundreds of thousands today exist on federal welfare, free housing, and food stamps!</p>
<p>With Aid to Dependent Children, minority women birthed eight to 10, and in one case, one woman birthed 24 children as reported by the Detroit Free Press, all on American taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>A new child meant a new car payment, new TV, and whatever mom wanted. I saw Lyndon Baines Johnson&rsquo;s &#8216;Great Society&rsquo; flourish in Detroit. If you give money for doing nothing, you will get more hands out taking money for doing nothing.</p>
<p>Mayor Coleman Young, perhaps the most corrupt mayor in America, outside of Richard Daley in Chicago, rode Detroit down to its knees.&nbsp;..&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He set the benchmark for cronyism, incompetence, and arrogance. As a black man, he said, &#8220;I am the MFIC.&#8221; The IC meant &#8220;in charge&#8221;.</p>
<p>You can figure out the rest. Detroit became a majority black city with 67 percent African-Americans.</p>
<p>As a United Van Lines truck driver for my summer job from teaching math and science, I loaded hundreds of American families into my van for a new life in another city or state.</p>
<p>Detroit plummeted from 1.8 million citizens to 912,000 today. At the same time, legal and illegal immigrants converged on the city, so much so, that Muslims number over 300,000. Mexicans number 400,000 throughout Michigan, but most work in Detroit. As the whites moved out, the Muslims moved in.</p>
<p>As the crimes became more violent, the whites fled. Finally, unlawful Mexicans moved in at a torrid pace. Detroit suffers so much shoplifting that grocery stores no longer operate in many inner city locations. You could cut the racial tension in the air with a knife!</p>
<p>Detroit may be one of our best examples of multiculturalism: pure dislike, and total separation from America.</p>
<p>Today, you hear Muslim calls to worship over the city like a new American Baghdad with hundreds of Islamic mosques in Michigan, paid for by Saudi Arabia oil money. High school flunk out rates reached 76 percent last June, according to NBC&rsquo;s Brian Williams. Classrooms resemble more foreign countries than America. English? Few speak it! The city features a 50 percent illiteracy rate and growing.</p>
<p>Unemployment hit 28.9 percent in 2009 as the auto industry vacated the city. In Time Magazine&rsquo;s October 4, 2009, &#8220;The Tragedy of Detroit: How a great city fell, and how it can rise again,&#8221; I choked on the writer&rsquo;s description of what happened. &#8220;If Detroit had been ravaged by a hurricane, and submerged by a ravenous flood, we&rsquo;d know a lot more about it,&#8221; said Daniel Okrent. &#8220;If drought and carelessness had spread brush fires across the city, we&rsquo;d see it on the evening news every night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earthquake, tornadoes, you name it, if natural disaster had devastated the city that was once the living proof of American prosperity, the rest of the country might take notice.</p>
<p>But Detroit, once our fourth largest city, now 11th, and slipping rapidly, has had no such luck. Its disaster has long been a slow unwinding that seemed to remove it from the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Even the death rattle that in the past year emanated from its signature industry brought more attention to the auto executives than to the people of the city, who had for so long been victimized by their dreadful decision making.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Coleman Young&rsquo;s corruption brought the city to its knees, no amount of federal dollars could save the incredible payoffs, kick backs, and illegality permeating his administration. I witnessed the city&rsquo;s death from the seat of my 18-wheeler tractor trailer because I moved people out of every sector of decaying Detroit.</p>
<p>&#8220;By any quantifiable standard, the city is on life support. Detroit&rsquo;s treasury is $300 million short of the funds needed to provide the barest municipal services,&#8221; Okrent said. &#8220;The school system, which six years ago was compel led by the teachers&rsquo; union to reject a philanthropist&rsquo;s offer of $200 million to build 15 small, independent charter high schools, is in receivership. The murder rate is soaring, and 7 out of 10 remain unsolved. Three years after Katrina devastated New Orleans, unemployment in that city hit a peak of 11%. In Detroit, the unemployment rate is 28.9%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s worth spelling out: twenty-eight point nine percent.&#8221; At the end of Okrent&rsquo;s report, and he will write a dozen more about Detroit, he said, &#8220;That&rsquo;s because the story of Detroit is not simply one of a great city&rsquo;s collapse, it&rsquo;s also about the erosion of the industries that helped build the country we know today. The ultimate fate of Detroit will reveal much about the character of America in the 21st century. If what was once the most prosperous manufacturing city in the nation has been brought to its knees, what does that say about our recent past? And if it can&rsquo;t find a way to get up, what does that say about our future?&#8221;</p>
<p>As you read in my book review of Chris Steiner&rsquo;s book, &#8220;$20 Per Gallon&#8221;, the auto industry won&rsquo;t come back. Immigration will keep pouring more and more uneducated third world immigrants from the Middle East into Detroit, thus creating a beachhead for Islamic hegemony in America. If 50 percent illiteracy continues, we will see more homegrown terrorists spawned out of the Muslim ghettos of Detroit. Illiteracy plus Islam equals walking human bombs.</p>
<p>You have already seen it in Madrid, Spain; London, England and Paris, France with train bombings, subway bombings and riots. As their numbers grow, so will their power to enact their barbaric Sharia Law that negates republican forms of government, first amendment rights, and subjugates women to the lowest rungs on the human ladder. We will see more honor killings by upset husbands, fathers, and brothers that demand subjugation by their daughters, sisters and wives. Muslims prefer beheadings of women to scare the hell out of any other members of their sect from straying. Multiculturalism: what a perfect method to kill our language, culture, country, and way of life. <br>

		<p>I like this guy, and I will listen to him because he knows PHYSICAL WORK.  Physical work, which is productive, whether it be driving an eighteen-wheeler, carpentry, or gardening, keeps a person grounded.</p>
<p>Frosty&rsquo;s words blow over me like a frigid wind out of Canada. But they are true, and, in a sense, they are bracing. </p>
<p>Bracing, because the things he talks about are going to force White cohesion, White martial arts, White deception-of-the-enemy, White Strength, Knowledge, Wisdom and Power to the UTMOST!</p>
<p>It is tragedy, in a Greek sense. But we Whites know tragedy in our bones; the blacks and hispanics do not. We will prevail. At first, a small remnant, but we will prevail.</p>

Just another &#8220;voice of intolerance and exclusion,&#8221; which pretty much means he&rsquo;s telling the truth.   Won&rsquo;t make a difference until the White liberal elites start to suffer, and long before then, they&rsquo;ll make the needed adjustments and accommodations so that they can keep scamming the system a little bit longer.  We must find ways of forcing them to remain in place and suffer the brunt of the Diversity Curse&rsquo;s Diversity Treatment.</p>
<p>We want to see White liberal elites bowing down to the dusky Arab Muslims and begging to be shown the path forward to atonement for &#8220;the burden of unearned White privilege&#8221;.<br>

		<p>A sobering article and it reminds me that I have seen my own Northeastern city decline before my eyes. You used to have public transit that was not too bad, but now all the drivers and most of the passengers are blacks. </p>
<p>When the bus stops outside my alma mater, a large proportion of the students are minorities and usually foreign. Only time will tell if we succeed in taking back our country. On some days I am overwhelmed with pessimism, but other times I read some news that makes me guardedly optimistic.</p>

		<p>Although being a Michigander for only 9 years as a refugee from democratic controlled,aka, Marxist N.J.; everything expressed by the author of this article is 100 percent correct from all the sources of information obtained through my life&rsquo;s experiences, especially first hand visits to that city ( very few reasons of occasion ), American refugees who now live in rural S.E. Michigan who are now my neighbors, social club members and fellow parishioners at various Christian churches. For now we a relatively safe because of the 75 mile &#8220;buffer&#8221; zone between us.</p>

I have one small criticism of this excellent piece:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Illiteracy plus Islam equals walking human bombs.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If someone in power and influence were to read it (small chance), I believe this is the one line they would take from the article; that we could solve this problem by spending more money educating Muslims.</p>
<p>Spending money on education is always tauted as the solution.<br>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the whole plan of the globalists.  Use socialism and Communism to destroy culture, religion, language, and race.  Divide and conquer.  Keep pretending that isn&rsquo;t the goal and the whole country will be just like Detroit real soon.  Operation Multiculturalism is the code for destruction.  Operation Total Rot would sound the alarm bells.</p>
<p>America has been on the decline since just after WWII.  It accelerated after the Korean War and is at breakneck speed the last two decades.  The greatest illusion of all time: diversity.  The only diversity I want is in the food industry.  Everything and everyone else can go home!<br>

		<p>The simple fact of the matter is that black Africans, and to a rather lesser extent, mestizos reduce any civilization they&rsquo;ve been allowed to inhabit to their own primitive level.  </p>
<p>Africa, following the departure of most of the white colonists and the granting of political power to the black natives, is returning to simple tribal savagery.  Black neighborhoods in America and elsewhere, once blacks get political control, soon resemble former colonial cities in Africa. </p>
<p>What would one expect of a people utterly lacking in creative or engineering skills, incapable of mastering scientific disciplines, personal self-control, or developing any sort of written language?  They&rsquo;re not like caucasians or Asians and never will or can be. The longer this obvious truth is denied the worse and more hopeless our situation will become. </p>

		<p>It is not the poor islamists that are the problem.  Most radical islamists (actually all of them) are born of wealthy families.<br>
usama bin laden comes to mind  &mdash;  his family is made up of millionaires.<br>
The 911 hihjackers were all from wealthy families.<br>
Even the communists are composed mostly of disaffected rich kids.<br>

		<p>Does any company outsource jobs to Africa?  And if not, why not?  Shouldn&rsquo;t there be an abundance of cheap labor that would enrich and diversify the company seeking the labor?  Why are China and India the most prevalent beneficiaries of outsourcing?</p>
<p>Oh wait!  I may have answered my own question.  Africa does have gold and diamond mines that companies are willing to invest in and employ African workers.  But that doesn&rsquo;t really qualify in my book because you can&rsquo;t outsource something that is in the ground in the country that you live in.  Somebody has to dig it up.  I suppose you could boat in Mexicans to do the work that Africans won&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Anyway, I could write some more, but just random thoughts for now.</p>

		<p>Diversity is NOT our strngth even though the opposite is the mantra of the diversity movement. To recognize the lie, notice how much funding is required to promulgate diversity. The fed, state, and local governments all have diversity programs to foster this lie on the people. If diversity were, in fact, such a strength, people would rush to embrace it, not be forced by fed programs to cater to it. </p>
<p>If anyone dares to question even one tenet of the diversity program, they are immediatly painted with that ubiquitous brush of RACISM! This shuts down 99.5% of people. Stop letting them shut us down. Speak the TRUTH boldly!!!</p>

&#8220;No place in America better symbolizes the ruination brought by Democrats than Detroit. The city has been run by Democrats for decades, while its economic life has been in thrall to the unions, which drove up wages to unsustainable levels, ruining the American auto industry.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
- Thomas Lifson, January 25, 2011 &#8220;The Ruins of Detroit,&#8221; from American Thinker<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 <br>
As I expected, the American Thinker article blamed the Democrat Party and the United Autoworkers&rsquo; Union. When the Democrat Party dominated the United States, and when one third of America&rsquo;s workforce belonged to unions, Detroit thrived. It is worth mentioning that Democrats dominate San Jose, San Francisco, and New York, and that these cities are thriving as never before, with low crime rates. <br>
 <br>
I think these are the real culprits: <br>
 <br>
&#8220;Even the death rattle that in the past year emanated from its signature industry brought more attention to the auto executives than to the people of the city, who had for so long been victimized by their dreadful decision making.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
- Frosty Wooldridge, Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville), January 17, 2011 <br>
    <br>
 <br>
I assume that Frosty Wooldridge is complaining about the dreadful decision making of the auto executives. If they had decided to continue to build cars Americans wanted to buy, and which sold well internationally, Detroit would still be thriving. <br>
 <br>
The black migration to northern cities happened before the War on Poverty, and before the civil rights legislation was signed. Blacks who moved north were not motivated by a desire for welfare checks and food stamps. They wanted to escape Jim Crow legislation and the K.  They also wanted factory jobs. They did not make the decision to ship those jobs to third world countries. Business executives did. </p>

		<p>I noticed the same mistake that #8 sbuffalonative did  &mdash;  that Islamic poverty equals jihadism.  There are too many terrorists who are not poor or uneducated to sustain such a premise, yet the MSM continue to state the meme, just as pundits do the threadbare nonsense about poverty causing black underachievement.<br>
Before long, someone will try to institute sharia in Detroit.  Most of us can just settle back with a huge bowl of buttered popcorn to watch the show!</p>

		<p>The elite puts up the empire after old rules and then they flee when it collapses, and then the new generations repeats. Europe have for two millenia been flooded of invasions from the cradles of civilisation in the middle east. All places where the imperial economy have attracted people and multiplied them have produced refugees of some sort. Egypt, Greece, Rome but M.E. in particular. One of the most obvious mistakes is lack of control of demography, which includes the disability to reproduce the failing elite. Remember the Mayans?</p>
<p>Groups who clearly have different standards or attitudes in reproducing cant share economy.</p>

		<p>What never fails to amaze me   &mdash;   the incredible &#8220;head up the backside&#8221; naivete of liberals. The incredible gullibility (or stupidity?) of liberals who cannot understand that diversity is tantamount to self-destruction of one&rsquo;s country and lifestyle.</p>
<p>Every police officer in our country is aware, even if unable or unwilling to ADMIT the majority of crimes are by members of racial or ethnic minorities. The liberals fall all over themselves manufacturing excuses for minority-member perpetrated crimes. &#8220;POVERTY&#8221; being their all-time favorite excuse.</p>
<p>They cannot look at the endless cycle of crime, corruption, poverty and misery in Black-governed nations   &mdash;   and face the reality the Blacks are the direct cause of their own misery and poverty.</p>
<p>Our government stupidly imports thousands of &#8220;political refugees&#8221; from places like Somalia. Settles them in our country, then refuses to admit that this is a grave disservice to Americans. Who end up with an increase in crime, along with having to support these people and their offspring in perpetuity with our taxes.</p>

<p>If you think unions did not have a major role in destroying many of America&rsquo;s industries, you need to go back to the drawing board with new information.  And, the Democrats you refer to are the pseudo Democrats aka the elites (i.e., Bloomberg was and is a Democrat).  And, if you look at political contributions over the past few decades, major public corporations and institutions support both parties.  It&rsquo;s a facade.  Both Democrats and Republicans have destroyed this nation.  The American people&rsquo;s lack of education, morals and ethics as well as government propaganda, lobbying groups, and complacency sealed the deal.<br>

		<p>Detroit was once the most prosperous, wealthiest Middle-class city in the world and the heart of America&rsquo;s industrial might.  The Globalist Banksters had to destroy it to facilitate the destruction of the rest of Middle-class America&rsquo;s economic and political independence.  It was a two step process and with Congress and the entire FEDGOV in their hip pocket it was easy. First they instituted Forced Integration and &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; laws that made it illegal for White Christians to enforce the rules of their civilization.  If local whites expected Blacks to act like civilized human beings and then dared to punish or exclude them for acting otherwise the entire, terrible armed might of FEDGOV would come down on their heads like a anvil. Civilization retreated and decent, productive people fled. The second part is Orwellian named &#8220;Free Trade&#8221; that subsidized and rewarded traitorous, multinational Corporations that offshored and outsourced American jobs.  It a couple generations the mighty Detroit that once was in now completely gone except for a few ruins and the indolent, pathetic people that inhabit them.  The Banksters were so successful with Detroit that they enacted their plan nationwide.  Unless real Americans act the whole country will be Detroit and there will be no where to run to.   </p>

		<p>In my own city of Indianapolis, we have a prospering downtown, beautiful historic districts, and very wealthy suburbs, all of which are majority white. The city herself is majority white and that is the only reason she moves forward. Any non-white neighborhood in the city looks just like Detroit.  People in the Great Lakes call her the &ldquo;Cinderella of the rustbelt&rdquo; but no one dare speak as to why she is. She is one of the whitest rust belt cities and her greatest recent success was pushing non-whites out of her downtown.  How long will it last? Probably not much longer. Already white elites cry out racism at the fact that downtown is only affordable to whites, and thus they are constructing low-income apartments (which aren&rsquo;t typically a problem if they are occupied by low –income whites) that have done nothing but cause chaos for the white neighborhoods. Why? I don&rsquo;t know, the same cultural brainwashing that tells them that if they are too comfortable or if their children aren&rsquo;t being raped there is a problem; where are the black folks? <br>
Soon buildings of columns and stone, gingerbread woodwork and gothic spires will fall to the barbarians, just as Detroit did.</p>
<p>Detroit is lost; it is an African city now. It is only Western in name and in her few architectural relics, everything else might as well be Nigeria.<br>

		<p>I must admit I watched most of Obama&rsquo;s State of the Union speech on Tuesday. I thought most of it was science fiction, especially where he calls for 100,000 more teachers, more science, math and engineering courses to be taught, and more government &#8220;investment&#8221;. Obama even mentioned an inner city school in Denver that was turf between two rival gangs, but boasted a 97% graduation rate.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, how is this going to be accomplished exactly, given the state of public schools in places like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Newark, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Oakland, New Orleans and of course, DETROIT?</p>
<p>Obama spoke so lovingly of creating &#8220;green&#8221; jobs, by using clean energy sources. How are these green jobs going to be created, if we keep importing Third World peoples who have NEVER been known for being environmentally conscious and dedicated in their countries of origin - countries like Mexico, Haiti, Somalia, Nigeria, Laos, every nation in the Middle East and Africa, and even China?</p>
<p>Obama says this is our &#8216;sputnik&#8221; moment. I disagree - it&rsquo;s more of our &#8216;Camp of the Saints&#8221; moment.</p>
<p>Sorry for going a little off-topic here, but, for the first time ever, I&rsquo;m reading someone actually accusing former mayor Coleman Young for accelerating the ruin of Detroit. Spot on, paisan! </p>

		<p>Memphis, TN has been moving towards becoming the Detroit-of-the-South since resident MFIC Willie Herenton took over as mayor in 1991. The city is so devastated that in the last few weeks, the Memphis City School Board voted to dissolve the entire school system and force a merger with the much higher performing county schools. Obviously, county residents don&rsquo;t want this. They live in the county because they like the better performing county schools as well it&rsquo;s demographics.   </p>
<p>If this happens, Memphis white county residents will continue the current exodus to adjoining counties and leave the new county residents to their own devices, Thunderdome style, just like they have the city. They will be out of a host to take tax revenues from and will be further left to their own devices.        </p>

I think the reality is that rich arab kids get the full treatment of class snobbery and general big-white-world understanding of how small their own existence is, because there are basically no decent Arab universities in existence which teach straight up math/science/economics courses (though I hear one is being built in UAE).<br>
The manage to hide their culture shock but soon realize they are caught between worlds, unwanted here, unable to achieve anything back home, seeing no point in trying given what they face.  That&rsquo;s gotta leave a lot of rage to people brought up under the false dogma of &#8216;a religious person is a good person is a deserving person&rsquo; that is Islam.<br>
Ordinary folk end up never leaving the country and frankly, they look and act primitively.  In their dress, in their pathologies of group behavior etc.  They also soak in the Madrassa and then Mosque environment where hating The West is an easy way to keep people from envying it.<br>
@20 Stein,<br>
I don&rsquo;t think you quite understand the differences in demographics and territorial saturation that are involved sir.  Genetic evidence shows as surprisingly clean long-sequence pattern in Europe: &#8216;white as the driven snow&rsquo;.  Even in &#8216;buffer states&rsquo; like Poland and Czechoslovakia.  But that won&rsquo;t hold true if the numbers become what demographics trends indicate.  Because there will be no where to hide from tribal raids and pass-through migrations of the Hun and the Tartars and the Mongols.  Not if they come from within.<br>
@21 Fed Up<br>
Don&rsquo;t be naive.  We are being infestively colonized so that when the country collapses and the move to ensure a &#8216;Global Government&rsquo; followon seems the best choice between fading to nothing and having to share, nobody who does the obvious: evicting the unwanteds and creating an ethnostate loyalty group, can get away with it without being called out for racism and Crimes Against Humanity.  That&rsquo;s why these untouchables are being dumped in places where you would not expect them to be.  Northern Climes, rural white agro states.  And generally smaller population groups.<br>
So that whites will have nowhere to run to create their own culture grouping.  No one to look to or point to or fall back on as proof of cultural excellence in what we have and can achieve.  Corporate extranationalism will think to protect itself by nature of it&rsquo;s small enclave status and &#8216;what it owns&rsquo;.  But the reality of any post-white, NWO, society will be that of a specialist pale labor body dictated to by the mass of it&rsquo;s yellow producers and brown consumers.  Whose nations are surprisingly monoethnic.  Gee, I wonder why?!<br>

<p>The Bahamas has a total population of less then one-third of a million people. About 12-15% of that is white, so that unlike basketcases like Haiti, it at least has a cadre of whites to provide organization and skills. Also slavery never really took off there.

		<p>#16, Tony:  Here is my story</p>
<p>My family lived in the midwest since the 1600s.  They were explorers, priests, traders, trappers, soldiers and farmers from France.  Later, they built and garrisoned Fort Detroit.  Much later in the 19th century they also became store owners and factory workers in the City they built.  I was born in Dearborn in the early &rsquo;50s.  Already by then the migration of blacks to the North and a germ of middle easterners began to change the city.  Still, some great years were ahead for the city.  After all, it was the industrial engine of Detroit that built planes, trucks, tanks and large weapons in greater numbers than the world had ever seen in order to win WWII.  Then something happened in the 1960&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>LBJ and his fellow socialists swept into Detroit with the Model Cities Program.  This welfare program was designed to destroy stable neighborhoods and replace them with Soviet-style human hives.  Socialist trouble makers were sent to the city via a new program called VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, now known as AmeriCorps, obama&rsquo;s threat come true to create his own private army.  Then Detroit&rsquo;s moment of truth came, the 1967 black riots.  Entire city blocks went up in flames and most of my family, numbering in the hundreds, left Detroit, some like my parents, left the state forever.  Detroit fought back against the rioters using National Guard troops to prevent the black scourge from invading white neighborhoods.  It was too late, the fear of rampaging blacks cast a final shadow on all who lived in the city.  As two of my cousins, who had served a tour in Vietnam, were both police officers, and still in the Reserves told me,  the smell of death was in the air.  It reminded them too much of their tour in SE Asia as they walked with M-14s at the ready in their own country and city.  Within a year they and their families were gone, to the South where I now reside.  My grandmother lived a short walk from Henry Ford&rsquo;s house and as a young child witnessed his first success at building an early auto.  She may have been one of the first to ever ride in the vehicle.  My father worked for, as he called him, Old Man Ford.  Other relatives became early electrical engineers in the late 1800s to build Detroit Edison, one of the nation&rsquo;s first electrical grids.</p>
<p>I have a lot more to relate but this will do.  Enough to lay claim to the European-Americans that in large part built this country into the good thing it was.  It is all gone now, as I listened to stories from my older relatives about Detroit, a wonderful city- almost as if it was a tale of Greek Mythology.  I even used to watch the JL Hudson Thanksgiving Day Parade, first in person, then on TV.  JL Hudson, a huge old time style department store is long gone, the parade no more.  Just as Detroit is truly gone, the industrial heartbeat of a nation, shriveled in death, a death set upon us through diversity, socialism, black tribalism, and white fright.  There are worse stories to tell, those that didn&rsquo;t get out and were targets for robbery, rape and murder.  And the city buildings themselves, shrieking and twisted in some horror show, decaying back to the earth after the army of human garbage has ruined their structures and souls.  </p>

		<p>Soprano Fan, you are correct to a degree; the Bahamas are relatively well off financially partly due to drug money flowing freely; graft and corruption are on a scale similar to that found in any black-run American city. It is a notorious drug transshipment country that turns a blind eye to smuggling of any sort. I would say from firsthand experience that the best black-run island/country is the Cayman Islands. They are clean, safe, have a thriving scuba diving tourist industry, no gambling, and the government cracks down hard on illegal drugs. Caymanians are religious, hard-working, decent folks. Consequently, they enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world.</p>

Thank you for your interesting comment. I am surprised that you think I am &#8220;defending non-White criminality.&#8221; I have been robbed at gunpoint once, and mugged several times, always by blacks. With the possible exception of Bermuda, blacks have a high crime rate everywhere in the world that they live. <br>

and scroll down, you will find an interesting book review of &#8220;The 10,000 Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution,&#8221; by Gregory Cochram and Henry Harpending.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
I have not read the book but I intend to. The authors attribute racial differences in crime rates and average IQs to the different populations pressures of hunting, farming, and city life. Whites in the Near East began experimenting with agriculture 10,000 years ago. Agriculture did not begin to spread in south Saharan Africa until about 2,500 years ago. Civilization began, again among Caucasians, in Egypt and what is now Iraq 5,000 years ago. Europeans began to build cities 3,000 years ago. Large numbers of blacks did not live in cities until the twentieth century.  <br>
 <br>
I do not hate blacks. There are some I like. I have no allusions about them as a race.  <br>
 <br>
I am a white Gentile of Germanic descent, but I have acknowledged on this website that East Asians and Ashkenazic Jews have higher average IQs. <br>

		<p>To be fair, all northern states have taken a hit from outsourcing in the last few decades. However, the places that are majority-white, or where whites are in charge, have tended to adjust far more effectively to the changes than nonwhite majority, nonwhite-run areas such as Detroit. </p>
<p>I would also point out that you can hardly expect US auto companies where unions force them to maintain &#8220;job banks&#8221; that basically pay people to sit on their bums all day, and which force companies to keep union jobs that could be far more efficiently automated, to compete with highly-efficient hard-chargers like the Japanese (who make Toyotas and Hondas on the one hand), the Koreans (who have recently made inroads into US auto markets) and the Germans. These countries either don&rsquo;t have unions, or have far more reasonable unions and more productive workers, as well as an overall higher degree of automation.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe the catastrophe that is Detroit or Memphis means, necessarily, the end of America as an economic engine. There will still be islands of prosperity but the sense will be that there is an ocean of despair and poverty that is the dominant feature of the country. I fear the real loser will be civil rights as police power must grow to contain the agitators. Leftism will become more strident, too, of course. Political violence will manifest itself as anti-police actions ( read cop-killings). The sense that &#8220;we are all in this together&#8221;, strained by multicultural and multiracial forces, will fade to nothing. National unity may remain as a legal fiction, but the emotional content will not be there. <br>
I wonder if the riots playing out in Tunisia, Egypt, Greece etc. are coming. With the increase in third-world conditions and populations it seems likely. This doesn&rsquo;t mean the USA will be diminished to those countries&rsquo; level of civilization, but that Americans will have to get used to increased levels of civil violence and police repression.</p>

Lived in Detroit for 35 years.  Every neighborhood I lived in slowly turned black.   We finally moved out of the city when we had no were else to run.   As neighborhoods turned black, crime went up and property values went down.  EVERY person in my family has been assaulted by a black person. The scores in The school&rsquo;s test scores fell like a rock even though Detroit spends about $1,500. MORE per student than many suburban school districts!</p>
<p>Black culture is a culture based in criminality.  But they aren&rsquo;t the bad ones for being criminals.  We are the bad ones for noticing they are black. Four decades of preaching the victim mentality and white guilt have succeeded in bullying and brainwashing whites into shutting up about the obvious problems in black communities around the world and that has aided in destroying black &#8220;urbania&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Blacks and whites have a child parent relationship.  Whites are the parents and blacks are the children.  The white liberals try to pump up the self esteem of the black children by telling them they are victims and their 85 IQ, sub-prime mortgage, terrible schools and dangerous neighborhoods are not their fault.  Rather, it is the vestiges of slavery.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the &#8220;don&rsquo;t tell dad&#8221; syndrome manifests itself in the no snitching black culture. Don&rsquo;t tell the white authority figures who is robbing all the houses in the neighborhood  and criminals stay on the street, and reproduce.  It will be interesting to see what happens when we finally reach critical mass.   </p>

<p>75% of black males drop of  high school in Detroit. <br>
Detroit News,  2010. <br>

71% of all high school dropouts  come from fatherless homes.  (Source: National Principals Association Report on the State of High Schools.)</p>
<p>75% of all adolescent patients in chemical abuse centers come from fatherless homes (Source: Rainbows for all God`s Children.)</p>
<p>85% of all children that exhibit behavioral disorders come from fatherless homes (Source: Center for Disease Control) </p>
<p>85% of all youths in prisons grew up in a fatherless home (Source: Fulton Co. Georgia jail populations, Texas Dept. of Corrections 1992)<br>
2003 Bureau of Justice Statistics analysis shows that 32 percent of black males born in 2001 can expect to spend time in prison over the course of their lifetime. That is up from 13.4 percent in 1974 and 29.4 percent in 1991. By contrast, 17.2 percent of Hispanics and 5.9 percent of whites born in 2001 are likely to end up in prison. <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2007/10/young_black_males_headed_for_e_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2007/10/young_black_males_headed_for_e_1.html</a></p>
<p>A study that looked at the relation between divorce rates and out-of-wedlock birthrates and violent crime between 1973 and 1995 found that nearly 90% of the change in violent crime rates can be accounted for by the change in percentages of out-of-wedlock births.

• A study that looked at crime in rural counties in four states concluded, <br>
&#8220;[A]n increase of 13% in female-headed households would produce a doubling<br>
of the offense rate.&#8221; (Osgood and Chambers 2000, p. 103)<br>

		<p>I have a dream.  If Detroit&rsquo;s blacks finally had enough of racist white American and picked up and left&hellip;here is what would happen.</p>
<p>Crime would drop by 85%</p>
<p>White suburbanites would pour back into the city with credit cards in one hand and power tools in the other to quickly rebuild.    </p>
<p>Schools that were considered lost causes would become good or even great again.  </p>
<p>Insurance rates on cars would fall by 50% since very few cars would be stolen. </p>
<p>The city would have to lay-off half the police force because they would not be needed. </p>
<p>The parks would be clean again.</p>
<p>The state would save hundreds of millions in public assistance payments</p>
<p><br>
On another related subject.  I was listening to Michael Eric Dyson on NPR.  He is a black leftist in case you did not know.<br>
He did a piece on why so many Mexicans had to be brought in to rebuild New Orleans after Katrina.  The theory was, the construction companies, hired by the federal government, hired ILLEGAL Mexicans and worked them half to death, did not pay them, then call INS on them to have them deported to avoid paying them.  That was his theory.    And I thought they had to bring in the Mexicans because hardly any blacks applied for any of the construction jobs for fear of losing their public assistance check!  Silly me.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;They did not make the decision to ship those jobs to third world countries. Business executives did&#8221;.</p>
<p>It might help, too, if people bought American cars. Subtract the &#8216;fleet&rsquo; type of sales to business and the government and sales of American cars may be well below 50% in America. <br>

<p>&#8220;America has been on the decline since just after WWII. It accelerated after the Korean War and is at breakneck speed the last two decades. The greatest illusion of all time: diversity. The only diversity I want is in the food industry. Everything and everyone else can go home!&#8221;</p>
<p>Although I agree with the diagnosis that American is on the decline, I differ on the start time.  America was on the decline early on.  The Great Depression was certainly a huge decline, and it was only halted by increased socialism and then propped up by a world war that turned the U.S. into a creditor state.  But the decline began before The Great Depression.  The decline began before the U.S. really even got started in its present form.  The American Civil War was a HUGE tragedy that began the decline that we are experiencing today.  The fact of slavery set up the decline because it created an economic system that was unethical and immoral.  I don&rsquo;t know what the alternative one might have been, but that coupled with the HUGE mistake of making freed slaves citizens rather than returning them to their ancestral homes was THE standout mistake that has led step by step to the decline that is gaining momentum today.</p>

&#8220;Why is White Excellence always brought down? WHY?&#8221;</p>
<p>______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Kind of a self-defeating question, isn&rsquo;t it?  The answer is contained in the very tone and sense of the question itself.  Why?  Why?  Because. Because&hellip; whites stand back and let it happen.  They don&rsquo;t care enough yet.  They haven&rsquo;t allowed it to get bad enough yet.  Maybe it will take mass starvation or open racial warfare, but something will eventually drop into our collective clue bag.</p>

<p>Excellent point whiteplight.  Two critical mistakes were made in the American past.  Allowing slavery to occur in the first place, and not sending the slaves back to Africa after Emancipation, willingly or otherwise.  Other mistakes came after, but these are the two biggies.</p>
<p>American whites need to come to grips with the fact that our ancestors created our misery for us, and we&rsquo;re either going to change the course we&rsquo;re on or perish as a nation.  It&rsquo;s time to sit up and take notice of the tactics of the opposition - to see how they&rsquo;ve managed to run political circles around America for 40 plus years.  Right now, our very predictable civility and sense of reasonableness is being used to destroy us.</p>

<p>Death of Detroit: Is Truth Unmentionable?<br>
[Patrick Cleburne] @ 12:46 am [Email author] [Email this article]  [Print this article] [Print this article]</p>
<p>Only one thing prevents me from saying I could not commend more strongly Nicholas Stix&rsquo;s blog American Thinker&rsquo;s Thomas Lifson Explains the Destruction of Detroit Without Once Mentioning &ldquo;Race,&rdquo; &ldquo;Black Rule,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Diversity: the Headline.</p>
<p>It should simply have been American Thinker&rsquo;s Lifson Lies about the Reasons for the Destruction of Detroit.</p>
<p>Because that is what he did. Detroit&rsquo;s history from fantastic boom to squalid collapse in barely half a century resembles that of an exhausted Klondike mining district–yet the underlying impetus, the Auto industry, has in fact gone from strength to strength.</p>
<p>Detroit has become a laughing stock in Europe–although possibly warming a Green&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>The truth is quite simple: huge prosperity attracted an immense influx of American blacks–whose habits of life made the city unviable. There are ways of dealing with this type of problem, but they were not adopted.</p>
<p>But the reason why the Stix blog deserves applause goes far beyond this, though: he draws attention to the bizarre but increasing practice amongst the PC &ldquo;Right&rdquo; to waste everyone&rsquo;s time with huge articles discussing major social problems while evading the obvious causes.</p>
<p>California in particular attracts this genre: see</p>
<p>Who killed California? The Neocons.</p>
