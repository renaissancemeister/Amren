<h1>A Factor of Success As Adults: Self-Control</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katherine Hobson, Wall Street Journal, January 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kids who scored low on assessments of self-control as toddlers were more likely to have adult difficulties, including health problems, alcohol and drug dependence, financial problems and a criminal record, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>The research, published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, tracked a socioeconomically diverse group of 1,037 children in New Zealand from birth to age 32. Kids were assessed on measures of self-control by parents, researchers and teachers every few years during childhood. They also did self-assessments.</p>
<p>Some 96% of the original participants were evaluated at age 32. Even after accounting for differences in social class, intelligence and home life, kids with lower self-control scores at age 3 were more likely to have adult health problems, such as sexually transmitted diseases, gum disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and excess weight, the study found. Among kids who scored in the highest 20% on self-control measures, 11% had multiple health problems in adulthood, compared with 27% of kids who scored in the lowest 20%. Kids with low self-control were more likely to later be dependent on drugs or alcohol, to have lower incomes, to be single parents and to have been convicted of a crime. </p>
<p>The researchers separately sampled fraternal twins in the U.K. and found that the sibling with lower self-control scores at age 5 was more likely to start smoking, to earn bad grades in school and to show antisocial behaviors at age 12, supporting the notion that self-control isn&rsquo;t simply dependent on family situation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Drs. Moffitt and Caspi [Terrie Moffitt and Avshalom Caspi, the Duke University psychologists who led the research] said that while children tend to improve their self-control skills as they get older, they&rsquo;re also likely to keep their relative position. So if a child trails his peers in self-control, he&rsquo;s likely to be behind his adult peers. Still, 7% of the children in the study &#8220;improved markedly,&#8221; they said, likely stemming from a variety of individual circumstances, such as a good school or changed family situation that improved structure in their lives.</p>

		<p>Self-control has a disparate impact.  Intelligence has a disparate impact.  Wealth has a disparate impact.  Sexual hygiene has a disparate impact.  Criminality has a disparate impact.  Propensity to rape has a disparate impact.  Credit scores have a disparate impact.  Incarceration rates have a disparate impact.  Illegitimacy has a disparate impact.</p>
<p>To erase these injustices, let&rsquo;s do what we know can solve the problem: reward underperformers with money, housing, assistance, jobs, and health care.  That way, when they create more children than they normally would, those future children will change their own DNA with all the extra money and opportunity&hellip;. &hellip;. &hellip;.</p>

		<p>&#8216;The histories of mankind are histories only of the higher classes.&rsquo;<br>
Thomas Malthus </p>
<p>&#8216;In a state therefore of great equality and virtue, where pure and simple manners prevailed, the increase* of the human species would evidently be much greater than any increase that has been hitherto known.&rsquo;<br>
Thomas Malthus </p>
<p>*Meaning an improvement, not necessarily a numeric change.</p>
<p>Of course children are _known_ to avoid competition for a given &#8216;niche behavior&rsquo; attention getting schemes in the eyes of their parents.  One will be an extrovert, the other the opposite.  One will be studious, another play music.  It is a psychological tactic so that superiority in a particular area doesn&rsquo;t hurt the lesser child&rsquo;s perceived chances of gaining love and support and is further divided by age and gender normed behaviors as &#8216;the baby of the family&rsquo; often knows.</p>
<p>It can only be given it&rsquo;s due by providing as much equal time and patience to the child&rsquo;s interests and aptitudes as possible.</p>
<p>The problem with this is of course when you induce a behavior or exacerbate it beyond all call.  Either by overbreeding (RvsK) and so removing total attention span from all your children.  Or by creating socialized conditions where inattentiveness and abandonment are norms of a latchkey family with isolation among strangers from an early age in the institutionalized daycare we call education.</p>
<p>There is simply nothing better than giving your child a stable, adult, personality to imprint on in common activities and caring empathy to inculcate a stable rationality.</p>
<p>The truly wealthy can afford to do this.  Can add to it enriching experiences beyond our own means to provide so that at least those with an inborn wild streak have -something- to capture their imaginations.  A work for work&rsquo;s sake ethic has destroyed our family lifestyles and will destroy our children&rsquo;s intellect and social conformity if we are not careful.</p>
