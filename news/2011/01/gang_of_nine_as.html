			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jaya Narain, Daily Mail (London), January 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A gang of Asian men has been arrested over claims they plied more than a dozen underage white girls with drink and drugs before turning them into sex slaves.</p>
<p>The vulnerable girls  &mdash;  some as young as 13  &mdash;  say they were forced to work the streets as prostitutes and hand over money to the men.</p>
<p>The nine men  &mdash;  eight of them Asian  &mdash;  were questioned by detectives after officers swooped on a number of addresses.</p>
<p>The arrests in Rochdale, Greater Manchester took place shortly before Christmas and are the result of a major inquiry into the sexual exploitation of teenage girls by men since 2008.</p>
<p>They come just days after a nationwide investigation was launched following a string of disturbing cases across the Midlands and the north involving men of Pakistani heritage grooming mainly white girls.</p>
<p>Last week Abid Saddique, 27, and Mohammed Liaqat, 28, were jailed for a total of 19 years after targeting underage girls.</p>
<p>The sexual predators  &mdash;  both British-born fathers of Pakistani origin who had arranged marriages in that country  &mdash;  cruised the streets of Derby in either a Range Rover or a BMW looking for vulnerable young girls to prey on. </p>
<p>The girls were &#8216;chatted up&rsquo; by the men at the roadside and invited to go for drives in the car  &mdash;  one of which was dubbed the &#8216;Rape Rover&rsquo;  &mdash;  where they were plied with vodka or cocaine before being taken to hotel rooms, parks or houses to be sexually abused.</p>
<p>The case prompted controversy after former Home Secretary Jack Straw described some of the white girl victims as &#8216;easy meat&rsquo; for gangs who trawl the streets looking for sex. </p>
<p>Research shows there have been 17 sex gang prosecutions since 1997  &mdash;  14 in the last three years  &mdash;  involving girls aged 11-16.</p>
<p>Last year a middle-class, privately-educated schoolgirl  &mdash;  also from Rochdale  &mdash;  was rescued after being forced to act as a sex slave to a gang of Asian men.</p>
<p>The troubled 14-year-old was targeted with vodka and cigarettes after being spotted by the gang wandering the streets.</p>
<p>She was made to have sex with a string of men before being pimped out as a white under age prostitute in Manchester city centre.</p>
<p>The girl was eventually saved when she flagged down a passing car whilst being chased down the street by one of the men.</p>
<p>Nine men  &mdash;  all Asian  &mdash;  were later jailed after admitting a series of serious sexual offences against the teenage girl including facilitating child prostitution.</p>
<p>The girl, who was forced to testify in a series of separate trials, is now working to put her life back together in a rehabilitation unit.</p>
<p>Retired police chief Mick Gradwell claimed pressure not to appear &#8216;institutionally racist&rsquo; led to a culture of silence over Asian sex gangs.</p>
<p>Mr Gradwell, a former detective superintendent in Lancashire, said: &#8216;You have girls being abused and raped and yet the most senior officers are refusing to comment on it. On what other subject would you get that?</p>
<p>&#8216;How many young girls have been abused and raped because of the reluctance of the authorities to say exactly what is happening?</p>
<p>&#8216;I worked on operations which had been set up to tackle, amongst other things, an element of Asian men who saw white girls as easy meat, as Jack Straw rightly put it. It was a persistent issue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;Some white girls are attracted to groups of Asian men because some are quite wealthy, shower them with gifts and drive round in fancy cars, </p>
<p>&#8216;The main pressure police have is being called institutionally racist if they highlight a crime trend like this. There&rsquo;s a fantastic reluctance to be absolutely straight because some people may take such offence.</p>
<p>&#8216;Rather than concentrating to solve and prevent it the bigger issue becomes &#8216;Can we point out a crime trend in an ethnic minority&rsquo;?&rsquo; </p>
<p>In the latest inquiry detectives have arrested the men aged between 20-40 after 14 underage white girls claimed to have been targeted for sex.</p>
<p>The girls  &mdash;  several of whom are missing from home  &mdash;  said they had been plied with drink and drugs then taken to flats and houses for sex.</p>
<p>Some of the girls were also said to have been forced into prostitution and passed amongst various other men. </p>
<p>The suspects  &mdash;  who were all bailed until March  &mdash;  were arrested on suspicion of child sex and prostitution offences.</p>
<p>In the latest inquiry senior officers at Greater Manchester Police have held a high level &#8216;Gold&rsquo; meeting to discuss the welfare of the 14 young girls.</p>
<p>Chief Superintendent John O&rsquo;Hare said: &#8216;This is an extremely complex investigation and the welfare of the victims is absolutely paramount.</p>
<p>&#8216;Both GMP and Rochdale Council have working strategies in place to combat child exploitation and will work together to prosecute people who target vulnerable children and young people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cheryl Eastwood, director for Children&rsquo;s Services at Rochdale Council said: &#8216;The service has taken necessary steps to ensure appropriate support is in place for any young person who may be affected as a result of these arrests.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>After 5 such cases the Authorities said, &#8220;Nothing to see here; just a co-incidence.  It has nothing to do with race.&#8221;  </p>
<p>After 10 such cases, the Authorities said, &#8220;Stop your racial profiling; gang rapes and gang-pimping are committed by people of all races.&#8221;</p>
<p>After 15 such cases, the Authorities said, &#8220;Islam is a religion of peace.  They are just like us.  We all bleed red.  They are here for freedom and democracy and for a better life. Diversity is our greatest strength.  It would be boring if we were all the same.  England cannot live without immigrants; we all benefit. </p>
<p>After 18 such cases, the Authorities said, &hellip; .</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just Britain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s must be getting harder for mainstream journalists to ignore that Muslim men (and Christian men of Middle Eastern origin) are doing this across the Western world, in Australia, Canada, continental Europe and probably the United States too.</p>
<p>A google search will bring up stories from all of these countries, with the common theme of white female sex victims and Muslim men.  Many more go unreported, as the young women don&rsquo;t want the shame of publicity, or blame themselves for what they got into.</p>
<p>In Canadian cities, where many of the taxi drivers are of foreign origin, it is a regular occurance for white females to receive unwanted advances from North African/Middle Eastern drivers.  Dating sites are another area where white females are stalked by Middle Eastern men who scarcely interact with whites on any other social level. Sometimes it happens at nightclubs, where Western liberty is a platground for Middle Eastern male aggression.</p>
<p>Like pack animals trying to separate their prey from the herd, these men go after females who can be removed from the protection of other whites. They employ drink and drugs to destroy whatever resistance the girls may have, and then try to maximize the exploitation, secure in the knowledge that nobody in their circle would report a &#8216;brother&rsquo; to the (white) police.</p>
<p>They boast their techniques and tales of conquest in the closed immigrant community and to their relatives back in the homeland, so that abusing white girls takes on a ritualistic quality, or that of a &#8216;perk&rsquo; of living in the West.</p>
<p>Perhaps an editor of a reputable major Western news service will have the courage to connect the dots and definitively expose this unique interracial pattern. </p>

		<p>There are almost 0 whites involved in gang rapes in America. The number of men of color involved in these multiple offender crimes, including rape, is quite high. Must be all the racism victims of color face. </p>

		<p>There have been reports to the effect that hundreds and probably thousands of girls have been abused like this over the last ten years.  </p>

		<p>I went to the Daily Mail&rsquo;s site to see the comments there. It says, &#8220;Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re likely terrified of being arrested on &#8216;racism&rsquo; charges if anybody speaks the truth in a comment.</p>
<p>Notice the author is Jaya Narain. Most likely only a Paki can be allowed to cover the story - just as here with blacks.</p>
<p>To any new readers: to Brits the term &#8220;Asian&#8221; means from the area in and around Pakistan, not China/Japan/etc as Americans take the term to mean.</p>

		<p>For the benefit of any newcomers, it&rsquo;s worth a reminder that &#8220;Asian&#8221; is usually a euphemism for &#8220;Pakistani&#8221; in today&rsquo;s Once-great Britain.<br>

		<p>The welfare of the girls is absolutely paramount so the U.K. court system allows them to bail out until March!!! Absolutely incredible. Does anyone really think that any of them will stay around? While I realize that these girls are naive, stupid or &#8216;troubled&rsquo;, and I suspect a number of them are runaways, it angers me greatly that a governmental system exists in the U.K. that first brings these animals into the country and then goes out of it&rsquo;s way to protect and defend the perpetrators of these heinous acts while throwing it&rsquo;s own people to the wolves. Where are the rights of the white indigenous population? Where the representation? Where the protection from aliens that were brought into our land and forced upon us without our consent? Any government that is so afraid of being called &#8216;racist&rsquo; that it will not even protect the young children, the future child bearers of the white race, is not fit to rule let alone exist. Where is the outcry of the parents, of the white people of the U.K. who&rsquo;s forefathers founded one of the greatest empires the world had ever seen? Have we sunk so low that we will allow our own children to become slaves to foreigners in our own land? Shame!!!!  </p>
