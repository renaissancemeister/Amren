			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sally MacDonald, KRIV-TV (Houston), January 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s a tea party unlike any Houston, and perhaps the entire country, has ever seen. The first Black Tea Party held its inaugural meeting Tuesday night in the Third Ward. Organizers of the Crispus Attucks Tea Party are quick to point out that anyone is welcome and it&rsquo;s not a political party.</p>
<p>Their mission statement reads in part:</p>
<p>&#8220;To build a strong base of conservative Black entrepreneurs, elected officials and constituents that provide Black conservatives a viable way to express and implement their conservative values politically.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re trying to break the stereotype that the tea party is racist,&#8221; said Moncrief [Co-founder Anita Moncrief].</p>
<p>At least half of the 75 or so people who attended the first meeting are white and have been defending the rights of taxpayers for a while.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Marie Johnson, a longtime Black Democrat. She&rsquo;s fed up with the direction the country is going and wanted to see what the movement is all about.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Newly elected Texas State Representative James Early White (R-TX District 12) isn&rsquo;t worried about taking any heat for being a Black Tea Party activist. He won in a predominantly white district.</p>

		<p>I always get a big kick out of black people who remind me of Black heroes&rsquo; contributions to the United States like Crispus Attucks or the Buffalo Soldiers.  A few of the black guys I work with at my job belong to a motorcycle club who honor the Buffalo Soldiers.  These same guys can&rsquo;t stand so called white racist.  I always thank them for those ferocious troops as I remind them about the courage and tenacity of those brave Buffalo soldiers.  After they say your welcome I respond by saying they helped the white man defeat the Indians.  The response from the members of that black motorcycle club is usually a blank stare. </p>

		<p>The news here isn&rsquo;t that a tea party meeting was half black.  The real news is that a tea party meeting explicitly aimed at &#8220;conservative&#8221; blacks was half white.</p>

		<p>About the only thing I remember about Crispus Attucks was that he was a black guy killed in the Boston massacre.  That&rsquo;s pretty much it&hellip;at least, that&rsquo;s what I remember from eighth grade history over 20 years ago!</p>

		<p>A decade ago I promoted a presentation by surviving Tuskegee Airmen at a local community college during Black History Month. It was well-attended, and genuinely a neat presentation overall, with more questions about their tactics for bomber escort duty and for downing the jet-powered ME-262 than about &#8220;being black.&#8221;</p>
<p>The surprising thing  &mdash;  or maybe not  &mdash;  was that there wasn&rsquo;t a single black in the audience, even though the student body had plenty of them. I doubt the average black &#8220;student&#8221; there could even have told me in what century WWII was fought, or against whom.</p>

		<p>My son&rsquo;s Christian American History text book (private school) takes pains to identify Crispus Attucks as a black killed in the Boston Massacre (i.e. another magic black, and blacks were the original patriots - same old, same old).  None of the other victims were identified.  I went to the Boston Massacre Historical Society website:  the &#8220;victims&#8221; were, as characterized by John Adams (Founding Father who successfully defended the  British soldiers) a mob of low lives and louts.  One was an Irish leather worker, another was a well known street brawler, another was a seaman (almost exclusively lower class) and Crispus Attucks was a mulatto, half black/half Indian, and a sailor.  They were part of a street mob which started throwing rocks and clubs (unprovoked) at a lone British soldier, who called for reinforcements (who then fired after numerous provocations against the orders of their commanding officer).  Don&rsquo;t trust the history books, go to the original historical sources and educate yourself.  Public school and writers of history are not your friends.</p>

		<p>For the Tea Party organizers, here&rsquo;s the important fact: Free markets, limited government, and the rule of law are, for the most part, ideas that appeal exclusively to whites. Very few nonwhites support these things. So you have two choices:</p>
<p>A. Compromise your integrity and ideals trying to get nonwhites to support your movement.</p>
<p>B. Have people call you racists.</p>
<p>Actually, I take that back. The first option doesn&rsquo;t exist. Glenn Beck tried to do that and failed.</p>
