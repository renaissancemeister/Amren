<h1>How to Get More Blacks and Latinos in Accounting</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joy Buchanan, DiversityInc, January 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Accounting continues to lack significant racial/ethnic diversity, which is a real challenge for accounting firms as they try to relate to increasingly diverse clients. Latinos comprise only 3 percent of the CPA profession and Blacks account for only 1 percent, according to the American Institute of CPAs. Data about new hires that were CPAs shows 4 percent were Latino, 4 percent were Black, and just 1 percent were American Indians.</p>
<p>Aggregate data submitted by the Big Four accounting firms for The 2010 DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity® survey show a similar lack of racial diversity in management positions, except for Asians. The data shows 3.9 percent are Black, 3.5 percent are Latino and just 0.22 percent are American Indian. Asians, in contrast, account for 15.7 percent of management positions at the Big Four. The Big Four are Ernst &amp; Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG and Deloitte, Nos. 5, 6, 15 and 25 on the list, respectively.</p>
<p>{snip} Ernst &amp; Young formalized its Discover Tax program in 2007 to attract more Blacks, Latinos and American Indians to the tax profession.</p>
<p>This month, Ernst &amp; Young held its fifth-annual, all-expenses-paid Discover Tax event in New York City, hosting more than 100 Black, Latino, American Indian and Asian students from 58 U.S. colleges and universities. The students are recommended by the faculty of more than 200 schools where Ernst &amp; Young actively recruits.</p>
<p>Raising awareness of tax professions is the challenge. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many times, Blacks, Latinos and American Indians want to go into professions they believe will have a positive impact on their communities, and professions in education, medicine and law are often the first to come to mind, Bouyer [Ken Bouyer, Americas director of inclusiveness and recruiting, who is Black] says. {snip}</p>

		<p>This is the same tired argumentation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know why there needs to be a racial quota in any profession, such as accounting, as long as equal opportunity is granted, which it is.  Track it backwards to primary school children, and you&rsquo;ll figure out the reason for so few blacks in accounting.<br>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this just funny?  For the people who say that there are no races and that it is all just a social construct, out of the other side of their mouths they truly believe that the only way to sell something or offer a service to someone else is if you look like them (racially, of course).</p>

		<p>Up until about 1997 or so, the CPA exam was a rigorous, comprehensive two day exam that less than 10% passed on the first try.  They then eased up on the rigor and increased the graduate hours required to sit for the exam in an attempt to get more &#8220;diversity&#8221; into the profession.  Glad to see it hasn&rsquo;t worked and there is still some semblance of competency in the profession.</p>
<p>The governing body of accounting, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) is facing a cold, hard truth - if they lower the standards to attain CPA status, then the profession will be overrun by the less competent and the salary structure will diminish.  The only way to keep the salaries high is to limit the number of accountants entering the profession - and that means maintaining the high entrance standards.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe E&Y; should have paid more attention to making sure their accountants didn&rsquo;t perpetuate a fraud than try to get more minorities into the profession:</p>

		<p>In all 50 states and the District of Columbia, it&rsquo;s been shown that blacks and mestizos have lagged behind Caucasians and Orientals for decades, in both math and language skills. Why should anyone be surprised why there&rsquo;s a dearth of blacks and mestizos at the top accounting firms? Accounting calls for the ability to calculate and organize numbers in a meaningful fashion, and to figure out non-quantitative terminology peculiar to the accounting field (like long-term loans, accrued interest, etc.). In addition, detailed reports must be made regarding the financial conditions of individuals and businesses  - no small task indeed.</p>
<p>Imagine Tarquinius Lumumba, a Detroit high school graduate, trying to pass the Certified Public Accountant&rsquo;s exam. He has graduated with a fourth-grade math skills level, and a fifth-grade reading skills level. Do you think a firm like Price Waterhouse is going to seriously consider him for an accountant&rsquo; s job?</p>
<p>Even if Lumumba were to get a job at Price, there&rsquo;s an exposure known as accountant&rsquo;s liability. Suppose Lumumba put the wrong data in the wrong column and so messed up a financial statement for the XYZ Co. XYZ sues Price for millions of dollars as a result. Price is ordered to pay XYZ $ 15 million as a result of Lumumba&rsquo;s error.</p>
<p>Blacks and mestizos have long sneered at education, and STILL they complain when nobody hires them at big accounting firms. Their white liberal lackeys pretend to be surprised.</p>

		<p>So minorities want to see minority faces when going to an accountant?  If I made such a request Id be called racist.  Why is racial unity a goal in some communities but a reminder of Hitler in others?   Never let them get away with these glaring double standards.  At least make them stammer with a response.</p>

		<p>Most of the Indians and Asians don&rsquo;t deserve to be there   &mdash;   The Accounting, Auditing and consultancy industry is really bad about H-1B visas and cheap legal immigrant labor from Asia.  Especially The Big Four.</p>
<p>One distinction that must be drawn is that &#8220;CPA&#8221; and &#8220;accountant&#8221; are not interchangeable.  You can be an accountant and not be a CPA   &mdash;   All a CPA means is that you&rsquo;re legally permitted to sign off on audits.  There is another kind of &#8220;certified accountant&#8221;   &mdash;   CMA, certified managerial accountant.  They&rsquo;re not in as high demand as CPAs, but their job security is much higher.</p>
<p>While the literal math skills that accountants use aren&rsquo;t that sexy, simple algebra at most, and the spreadsheets and calculators take care of that, the part that makes the field of accountancy hard for lower IQ minorities is the non-mathematical abstractions of the way accounts relate to each other and affect each other.  That and accounting is very much a grind   &mdash;   While it&rsquo;s not that difficult for those who have mastered it, it is a lot of arduous and repetitive work, especially around the time that your corporation closes the books, if you work for a corporation, or the first four months of the year, if you make your living doing people&rsquo;s income taxes.  This kind of work load does not lend itself to goofing off, showing up late, leaving early, not showing up at all, loafing on the job, and so on, which blacks and Hispanics are good for.  You miss a little bit of work and all of a sudden you&rsquo;re way behind.</p>

		<p>With 25 years in the engineering profession, I can attest to the fact that accounting is not the only occupation where Blacks, American Indians, and Latinos are few and far between. Asian (oriental) and Asian Indians are over represented in the engineering field relative to their presence (in percent) in the U.S. Engineering, along with accounting, medicine, economics, and philosophy require critical thinking skills and understanding of logic and mathematics. The drop out rate in most State schools for engineering majors is approximately 60% -only the ones who can make the grade actually graduate. Historically Black Colleges (HBC), such as North Carolina A&T; have engineering programs, but those programs, in my opinion, are not as rigorous as the State Universities or the private engineering schools (MIT, RPI, etc).  Go to www.collegeresults.org and look at the SAT scores of the HBC&rsquo;s - you can see that these scores, particularly in math, are 200-300 points lower than most other schools. Many engineers take a state board exam, called the Professional Engineer (PE) exam - the &#8220;equivalent&#8221; of an accounting CPA.  I have only met one Latino PE and not one Black or American Indian PE in 25 years in the field.  </p>

		<p>Not that this has any relevance to diversityites, but Blacks who have the intelligence and diligence to be CPA&rsquo;s have better places to go. The fields of law, medicine, management, or engineering are far more attractive to Black men than accounting. This is what I have gathered from talking to Black men who succeeded in these fields before affirmative action. One even referred to his brother who was a successful accountant as the &#8220;dumb one in family&#8221;. </p>

		<p>For the better than three decades I had my own business my CPA firm was overwhelmingly Jewish.  Why?  By and large Jews are SMART!</p>
<p>One doesn&rsquo;t find many Hispanics and especially blacks in any profession, excepting athletic endeavors.  Why?  They&rsquo;re NOT as smart as Caucasians and Asians.</p>
<p>But enough of these dismal and universally known facts.  We must launch another investigation to uncover the &#8220;root causes&#8221; of black failure.  Ah, what the hell, we can state unequivocally, without further investigation that the root cause is racism!  Who&rsquo;d have thought of it?  The accounting profession is rife with racism!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been a CPA for 22 years.  In my upper level college accounting courses, I had one fellow student who was black.  My first accounting job out of college was as a junior accountant at a CPA firm which, wonder of wonders, had no black staff.  But as was true with most all CPA firms, the company was very conservative and required staff to carry themselves in a dignified manner, dress conservatively, and be professional and respectful in all dealings with coworkers and clients, all while working a minimum of 55 hr weeks during tax season.  Given these requirements, is it any surprise so few minorities would make it in such an environment?   </p>
<p>In all my years of working in accounting, the highest level I have ever seen blacks attain was clerk.  The reason?  Lack of critical thinking skills and an inability as another poster stated, to think in the abstract. Rote tasks they can handle, but anything requiring abstract thinking or reasoning and they fail miserably.</p>

		<p>This is an easy fix, just do what every other profession in America is doing, dumb down the curriculum in college, dumb down the exams for professional certifications and the rest will fall into place.  Soon the profession will lose all credibility and CPA&rsquo;s will earn the same as cashiers at Wal-Mart.  Wherever blacks and hispanics are inserted in society they either fail or are propped up by the undervalued self-hating whites who will ultimately destroy the profession and then blame it on racism.  The cycle is as easy to track as the sun&rsquo;s rising and setting.<br>

I have to believe that businesses and people who have the money to need CPA&rsquo;s want highly qualified people handling their assets. I can&rsquo;t imagine they would hire people on a PC basis.</p>
<p>Monty Python did recurring skits on Chartered Accountants. The running joke was that they were boring. Considering the nature of blacks and Hispanics, I don&rsquo;t believe many would find much excitement in this profession.</p>
<p>Still we must create parity in every line of work so good luck finding enough interest minorities.<br>

		<p>White Male Engineer hit the nail on the head!! I worked for a federal agency which tried very, very hard to increase the numbers of minorities (black and latino) in the engineering and scientific fields by offering full scholarships to universities. Very few of these minorities even applied, and for those who did, very few made it through the programs to graduate. The reasons for these failures is obvious, but political correctness prevents honest discussions. </p>

		<p>An accountant is a mathematician with a job.  </p>
<p>Unless you can do algebra, you can&rsquo;t pass introductory accounting.  By senior year of college, an accounting major has taken a year of statistics and math through differential calculus.  Math is used throughout accounting; e.g., the Advanced Financial Accounting class in senior year requires solving simultaneous equations.</p>
<p>Five years of education are required to be a CPA in the US, so a CPA-candidate needs the ability to earn a master&rsquo;s in accounting before taking the CPA exam. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of IQ.  I have seen studies that indicate the median IQ of accountants is above 125.  No wonder Asians are in management positions in the Big 4.  </p>

		<p>I know when Amren started 20 years ago, Asians were still nearly invisible and blacks were still the largest minority and causing most of the problems.  However, there have been big changes since then.  Increasingly, the Asian takeover of high paying jobs is destroying the white middle class.  It&rsquo;s time to stop thinking of Asians as some kind of model minority who prove that America isn&rsquo;t racist and start focuses on the direct damage that is being done by their usurping our jobs, universities and small businesses.  </p>

		<p>I used to write exam problems for the Professional Engineering licensing exams, and about 10 years ago we hit that baloney - pressure from the NEA to &#8216;consider modifying the format of the exams to account for skills achieved in more collaborative learning environments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>You know the deal - in order to obscure direct observation and differentiation of students who *can* learn from those who *cannot,* college kids do labs in GROUPS. You all know how that works out: one or two kids who actually study do all the work, but all six or so kids at the table are awarded equally high credit.</p>
<p>But they sure don&rsquo;t like the demographic results when a bunch of engineering candidates have to *individually* prove they know how to calculate stress in a cantilever beam with a fluctuating load on the tip, no talking or sharing notes or textbooks, boo hoo hoo.<br>

<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t ever remember the actual math in any of my accounting courses to be that hard.  But other non accounting classes required to be a good accountant did feature math that difficult.  Let me put this in a metaphor.</p>
<p>If you expect to be the curator of a museum that specializes in 19th Century art of the Romantic period, then you&rsquo;ll also be expected to have a working knowledge of music, literature and history from the same period, as they all affected each other.  So if you&rsquo;re pursuing an art history degree, you&rsquo;ll be expected to have enough hours in music history, lit and straight history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo; the same way with CPAs and CMAs   &mdash;   Once you&rsquo;re out of college and you start going to work doing audits or CVP analyses, you will rarely need to use complicated math.  But, The Powers That Be expect a CPA or CMA to be well versed in a lot of related fields, like economics, logic, probability and statistics, and certain elements of the law, especially business law and contract law.  In order to have a working knowledge of those related peripheral fields, one is going to have to be good enough in math, either beforehand, or taking those math classes as prerequisites or parallel requisites.  You&rsquo;re not studying to be a contract lawyer or economist or statistician per se, it&rsquo;s just that you&rsquo;ll have a good enough knowledge of those fields to help you in your career of auditing firms and doing CVPs for upper management.  It&rsquo;s just that once you&rsquo;re doing the audits and CVPs, you&rsquo;re not employing advanced level math.  But the requirement for advanced level math, de facto or de jure, in college, acts as a separator between the wheat and the chaff   &mdash;   One who can&rsquo;t solve at the very least the most rudimentary of differential equations probably doesn&rsquo;t have the mental makeup to be a good all around CPA.</p>

		<p>Homer, we have all noticed that tv commercials and dramas require at least one mandatory token black person. You cannot have a group of White friends sitting around without their requisite black buddy. This diversity-in-your-face makes me puke. It is forced integration, unrealistic, and contrived by self-hating, groveling Whites or Hollyweird J-people desperate for black forgiveness and acceptance. It is blatant social engineering. This is why my tv stays OFF.</p>

		<p>When will there be enough blacks and hispanics in all white institutions?  When wil whites have &#8216;done enough&rsquo; for blacks and hispanics?  When will blacks and hispanics blame themselves for their own shortcomings and focus on turning their lives around without depending on others?  When will blacks and hispanics drop their hatred and entitlement mindset?</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t expect to see hand wringing and phrases &#8220;Asians overrepresented&#8221;, and then read about steps taken to amend this, outside the pages of AmRen. That phrase that could give people the wrong idea and be &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s even &#8216;hatred&rsquo;, at least, it would be if whites put forth those sentiments. </p>

		<p>28  &mdash;  Question Diversity   I agree that usually a CPA doesn&rsquo;t have to use much higher mathematics.  However, 30 years ago, I did test the probability of a warranty claims with an integral equation from a scholarly article.  Once, a colleague on an audit recognized that the client had an in-substance defeasance of debt.  Another colleague used heteroscedasticity for calculation of costs with adding a second shift to a manufacturing operation.  </p>
<p>My point is not that a CPA will ever use all the topics covered in a bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s program, it is that he or she has enough education to recognize a problem for a client and go seek more information or make a referral.  Perhaps analogies would be a doctor who recognizes for the first time a case of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever or a lawyer for the first time recognizing an estoppel issue.</p>

What&rsquo;s even more hilarious is the inversion of reality in the media, in which white men are portrayed as big, dumb hulks, and black men are portrayed as computer nerds (sometimes they&rsquo;ll have a white female computer nerd, which is only marginally more believable). I remember that in college, the whitest, most male-dominated major was the computer science major. While I often saw many Asians in the engineering school (compared to their overall share of the population), I never saw that many in the computer science major, though they were by no means absent. I wonder if this has to do with the fact that while coding is highly technical (something Asians are quite good at), it also requires a high degree of verbal intelligence (since coding is essentially creating instructions for a computer in a programming language), in which whites tend to be at least the equal of Northeast Asians (whose intelligence is skewed heavily towards spatial concepts).</p>
