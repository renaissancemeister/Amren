			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Doyle, Daily Mail (London), January 5 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of Muslim converts in Britain has passed 100,000, fuelled by a surge in young white women adopting the Islamic faith.</p>
<p>The figure has almost doubled in ten years  &mdash;  with the average convert now a 27-year-old white woman fed up with British consumerism and immorality.</p>
<p>The numbers, revealed in a study by multi-faith group Faith Matters, have led to claims that the country is undergoing a process of &#8216;Islamification&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The survey of converts revealed nearly two thirds were women, more than 70 per cent were white and the average age at conversion was just 27.</p>
<p>But the organisation&rsquo;s report argued that most converts saw their religion as &#8216;perfectly compatible&rsquo; with living in Britain.</p>
<p>It said: &#8216;Converts do not represent a devious fifth column determined to undermine the Western way of life  &mdash;  this is a group of normal people united in their adherence to a religion which they, for the most part, see as perfectly compatible with Western life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The report estimated around 5,200 men and women have adopted Islam over the past 12 months, including 1,400 in London. Nearly two-thirds were women, more than 70 per cent were white and the average age at conversion was 27.</p>
<p>In 2001, there were an estimated 60,000 Muslim converts in Britain. Since then, the country has seen the spread of violent Islamist extremism and terror plots, including the July 7 bombings.</p>
<p>Converts who have turned to terror include Nicky Reilly, who tried to blow up a restaurant in Bristol with a nail bomb, shoe bomber Richard Reid and July 7 bomber Germaine Lindsay.</p>
<p>But the report said the number of converts sucked into extremism represented a &#8216;very small minority&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted by Kevin Brice from Swansea University, asked converts for their views on the negative aspects of British culture.</p>
<p>They identified alcohol and drunkenness, a &#8216;lack of morality and sexual permissiveness&rsquo;, and &#8216;unrestrained consumerism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>More than one in four accepted there was a &#8216;natural conflict&rsquo; between being a devout Muslim and living in the UK. Nine out of ten women converts said their change of religion had led to them dressing more conservatively. More than half started wearing a head scarf and 5 per cent had worn the burka.</p>
<p>More than half also said they experienced difficulties after converting because of negative attitudes among their family.</p>
<p>Last year Lauren Booth, sister-in-law of former prime minister Tony Blair, attracted widespread publicity when she announced that she had converted to Islam.</p>
<p>Fiyaz Mughal, director of Faith Matters, said: &#8216;Conversion to Islam has been stigmatised by the media and wrongly associated with extremist ideologies and discriminatory cultural practices.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t attach to much importance to this.<br>
Young white women also get attracted to non-Western religions like Wicca, Shamanism, Gaiaism and Yoga. <br>
It&rsquo;s just a product of our spiritual cornucopia.<br>

		<p>So many questions!</p>
<p>-Do most of the female converts marry a Muslim man shortly after their conversions?</p>
<p>-If so,is it fair to say they are converting for the sake of their relationships?</p>
<p>-Are these women on average physically attractive? Do they have good options to marry Englishmen of Anglo-Saxon ancestry?</p>
<p>-Is the answer about converting due to disillusion with excess materialism accurate or something people say to cover less noble motives?</p>
<p>-Is Islam compatible with Western values? I have my doubts, but apparently time shall tell.</p>
<p>-Are the people converting to Islam of Anglo-Saxon ancestry or are they non-Muslim immigrants from the outskirts of the empire?</p>
<p>I ask the questions about converting for relationships because in the U.S. white women who marry outside their race usually don&rsquo;t have good options within it. I&rsquo;m all for voluntary association, but the stereotype usually holds.</p>

		<p>The old saw really is true:  When people cease to believe in something, they will believe in anything.  In this case, that means believing in a ludicrous, despotic religion whose growth portends the end of England.  It makes sense that women, genetically programmed to see the exotic and the erotic as synonymous, would be the most susceptible to conversion to Islam.</p>
<p>Enoch Powell was right!</p>

		<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, who else would make up the rest of the converts?  While there is a lot of doom and gloom coming from the UK, 70% is probably less than the White population. While it&rsquo;s disturbing and unfathomable why someone would go that route, I think it appears that it would be a stretch to say that Whites are doing it in a greater proportion than West Indians or non-Muslim Asians if it&rsquo;s 70%.   </p>

		<p>Average convert is a 27 yr old white female. Islam provides a strong structure and clearly identifiable standards of behavior that these women apparently appreciate.</p>
<p>Why would they cast off their western ways to embrace such a conversion?<br>
I would argue that this may be due to the lack of strong men of character that the UK once was, rather than the wispy metrosexuals who stand for nothing (and resist nothing)that many UK males are now. </p>

		<p>After knowing some British people for some time, many of whom actually are as described (immoral, materialistic and prone to drunkenness) I can&rsquo;t say that I blame the women for looking for a more patriarchal model of personal self-control.</p>
<p>Over here in the states we&rsquo;ve had a long tradition going back over 25 years of women converting to Hinduism (hare krishnas etc) and many young men too.  They also cite the desire for some transcedental truth.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, I see white women all the time in Hindu clothes and red dots, shuffling about.  The best restaurants in my area (all vegan) are run by hindu converts!</p>
<p>A lot of Christians are also leaving traditional churches and going pentecostal for the certainty it provides.</p>
<p>The modern western world is spiritually adrift, and we will see more conversions all across the board.  (Have you heard about the 100,000 people worldwide who currently worship Odin and Thor?)</p>

		<p>Conservative Christianity obviously isn&rsquo;t an attractive alternative for these young Britons seeking escape from immorality. Conservative Christianity discredits itself with baggage which these youth cannot abide by.</p>
<p>Why not something indigenous to Europe, like Norse or Druidry?</p>
<p>The reason they go to Islam is because they see the strength of Islam demonstrated in the way it muscled its way into Britain and forced elected and state agents to bend to its will.</p>
<p>There is nary a Norse or Druid church or priest to be found, because of the effectiveness of Christianity at wiping out the vestiges of indigenous European spirituality. </p>

		<p>These people would not have converted if political correctness did not prevent their society from stating the facts about the muslim prophet. There literally is no difference between him and Hitler. Peace. Fed up with consumerism. Then why are they converting to the only major religion in which the founder made his followers give him a percentage of the loot (killing of people and stealing their things and women), or whos last words were &#8220;curse the christians and the jews&#8221;. These ignorant idiots are victims of political correctness.</p>

		<p>My theory is that women, even strong, independent, career-minded women, are attracted to strong men.  I think the attraction that Islam has for some native born white British women is that Muslim men at least act like men, (although at time, they act too much like men), while most native born whites are notorious PC-obsessed metrosexual pansies.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;with the average convert now a 27-year-old white woman fed up with British consumerism and immorality.&#8221;: I would say this demographic for conversion could have been predicted.  The older generation(s) of today had a greater indoctrination with Christianity, and so we will not see too many of that age group converting.  But for those at age 27, plus or minus several years, mostly what they had during the formative years is just as it is stated, consumerism and immorality, shoved at them all day long since they time they could watch television.  Throw in the female gender which (I believe) has a greater tendency for followership, and you have this demographic as your average convert.  One additional note: A part of the conversion process is just the presence of Muslims in an area and their consistent discussion of Islam. They don&rsquo;t have to be overbearing, but just consistent in their message, and over time, we will see Westerners fall for Islam.  I believe it is along the lines of &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t stand for something, you will fall for anything.&#8221;  Since we in the West no longer stand for Christianity, our youth have been set up to be very suseptible in falling for Islam. And yes, I know, Islam doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, as it&rsquo;s teachings are convoluted to the extreme. But, if you have nothing else to fall back on, and if you listen to a Muslim discussing religion long enough, you find you might want to convert just to get them to stop babbling you to death.</p>

		<p>These women believe that the only way out &#8220;British consumerism and immorality&#8221; is to convert to Islam? And then, they whine that they don&rsquo;t receive the acceptance they want.  However, I&rsquo;m sure that they prefer to remain in that immoral and materialistic United Kingdom rather than emigrate to Somalia or Afghanistan(home of the Bacha Bazi), where Islamic &#8220;morality&#8221; abounds. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The survey of converts revealed nearly two thirds were women, more than 70 per cent were white and the average age at conversion was just 27.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is likely due to whites who have a predisposition to belong to something that has strict discipline and definitive absolutes about what is right and what is wrong.</p>
<p>But take note of the fact that the silence is deafening from the PC section, even though Islam is a cruel, harsh, inhibited, inflexible religion.  But if these same people were converting to Christian fundementalism&hellip;which is infinitely milder&hellip;.they would be denouncing them as the incarnation of evil.</p>
<p>Just look at some of the dregs who come on this site and describe ordinary Christians as &#8220;nut cases,&#8221; &#8220;whackos&#8221; etc, frothing at the mouth and drooling down their chins, but they keep mum when an article appears describing the stoning to death of a woman for what most would regard as a civil tort, or the honor killing of a Muslim woman who wears lipstick.</p>
<p>The greatest haters on the planet are those who vociferously and unreasonably denounce Christians.  They&rsquo;ve been taught in their homes since early childhood to hate Christians.</p>

In western nations, feminists have overthrown the natural order of male and female relationships. In part, their success came in re-defining Christianity as a oppressive male institution.</p>
<p>However, the natural order remains. Many women don&rsquo;t want to be independent. They want a man to provide for them.</p>
<p>Islam offers some women the opportunity to return to the natural order and yet not be seen as kowtowing to patriarchal Christianity.</p>
<p>And feminists have yet to stand up to Islam.<br>

		<p>So they want a life free from immorality, but I wonder why they feel that conversion to Islam is their only choice.  Fundamental Christians, Buddhists and sects of Hinduism put great emphasis on strict and simple living where drugs, alcohol and other vices from which these women cannot abstain on their own, are adamantly rejected. If they become Carmelite nuns, they should feel completely satsified; they wouldn&rsquo;t even have to see others be immoral.  And Carmelites don&rsquo;t carry the stigma of terrorism or social brutality. I believe that these British women just like the trappings of Islam.  The headscarves give them attention and a sense of moral superiority over others. Like a fad, it will wear off eventually.  I remember when so many young British women were into Magic, Wicca, Nordic Paganism and Beatle-inspired Krishna Culture awareness too. None of them changed Britain.</p>

With that said I think many Westerners,especially in Europe, maybe looking for a stricter, more definitive religion. From what I&rsquo;ve seen of the Church of England they have become a weak, politically correct institution. And I think that has happened to much of Christianity.</p>

		<p>The reporter could have added some statements from Christian leaders about this. Probably any quotes would be wishy-washy but it would be insightful to put them in print for all to read. I&rsquo;ve been noticing how Christian leaders never say that Christianity is the true religion anymore. You can be a Christian if you wish, you have a right to your faith, but in essence all religions are the same. That&rsquo;s the modern lesson we are to absorb without actually being explicit about it.</p>

		<p>How stupid!  No British subject is required to drink any alcohol at all, or to have sex with anybody at all, or to wear anything or buy anything they don&rsquo;t want to.   However, if they really feel they will be better off under muslim rule, let them go to Pakistan or Iran, or Saudi Arabia, or perhaps the Sudan&hellip;  They perhaps first ought to give an ear to some women FROM the muslim-controlled part of the world,  such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali, or Brigitte Gabriel.  </p>
<p>But this clearly has nothing to do with logic or knowledge.  There is a far more basic natural law at work here.  </p>
<p>When white, British males are forbidden (by law!) from standing up and saying without reserve that they are superior, and that their culture is superior, and that their entire country and its history are superior - well, they have then obviously been forced to bow to others.  <br>
If they show weakness by meekly accepting that subjugation, if they fail to reject absolutely and resist resolutely that humiliation without regard for what anybody says or does about it, while the invaders show that they are strong and able to impose their will and their rules on society, then OF COURSE there will be women who side with those invaders.  It has always been so.  </p>

		<p>Hello UK white males - you might want to switch the light off when you leave. You have single-handedly, and with zero external pressure, completely ruined the greatest empire the world has ever known. In fact, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to try and understand how you managed to screw it up so badly. </p>
<p>The UK had absolutely everything going for it, yet you decided to import millions of parasites - not against your will, but in fact you actually encouraged it! ENCOURAGED IT! And not just that, but you paid them - not just to arrive, but to live! </p>
<p>You gave them prime real estate - for nothing! And what did you ask of them for this? Nothing! So you import your parasites, give them loads of money, and then pay them to do nothing!</p>
<p>Then you give them free health care. They reward you by clogging up your courts with endless lawsuits about how you have screwed them over. </p>

Once the 3rd world catches up to Britain, it will be one of those &#8220;What was I thinking moments,&#8221; but then it will be too late.</p>

		<p>What is the lure of Islam? Do these women even know the servitude they&rsquo;re signing on for? Do they realize that this law/religion/philosophy is one of death to those who don&rsquo;t follow Sharia law? There seems to be no goal or aim except to do away with anyone who does not follow Islam&rsquo;s teachings. Do they willing exchange freedom for slavery? I have long admired the British for their steadfast refusal to bow down to the enemy in WW 11. What would those brave souls think of the people who now embrace an even greater evil.</p>

		<p>Whites are stuck in a downward spiral of debt induced consumerism, animalistic sexual deviousness, contempt for educational accomplishment, and a general disdain for family structure and authority. We want our kids to be football players and cheerleaders rather than scientists, we prioritize a McMansion and a SUV over funding a college saving plan for our children, we feel divorcing our spouses over frivolous arguments or having extra-marital affairs is a birthright, we ridicule smart students as &#8220;nerds&#8221;, our media promotes low-IQ people like Paris Hilton sells low IQ &#8220;reality shows&#8221;; we spend 6-9 hours every weekend watching football on TV rather than exercising at the gym or enhancing our job skills, our priests rape young boys at the alter&hellip;.I think it&rsquo;s time to look into the mirror and address our own short-comings before deriding those among us who decide to follow a different non-Western way of living their lives.</p>

		<p>I agree with RandyB, a lot of this is exoticism that, for many, will quickly fade when another trend religion comes to them.</p>
<p>This is a very small amount of British white women, so the concern is not too significant. However, if women in droves began converting (seriously) I would no longer consider them members of the white race, considering the very anti-white history Islam has played. Do these women remember Vienna? Cordoba? How about the once great Constantinople? Islam has never been a friend to the Western peoples, and never will be. <br>

		<p>Question Diversity #11: I have read all of your posts since I began reading this AmRen site, and you are usually dead-on target with your view of an issue. But, I see a problem with how you view current White men in England, or anywhere for that matter. </p>
<p>Real White men are more than fed up with all the bulls56t that has been shoved down our Societies&rsquo; throats for decades. The only difference between the Muslim savage, and a White man with a family is that the White man normally get arrested for a &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; when he defends himself, his family, and others, whereas the Muslim gets away with the crimes they have committed, under the guise of &#8220;Tolerance&#8221; by the Politicians, and the Courts.</p>
<p>The idiots that enact and discharge these insane laws are the ones that need to removed from Office, either in a General Election, or in a Recall Election, and the Judges removed under Judicial Review. None of these two groups have upheld their Oaths of Office, and that should qualify them for instant removal. </p>
<p>Once these bootlicking Liberals have been removed, and true Nationalist, Conservative, and Constitutionalist Law Makers and Judges are seated, then we can get on with the needed work at hand.</p>
<p>There will be Common Sense, Constitutional, and Natural Laws to guide us, again. </p>
<p>And to go further, watch how White men who are backed by White Nationalist, and Conservative Politicians, and Judges respond to what is happening to their people, and their Countries.</p>
<p>Finally, would you, or could anyone descibe Country Music Stars, Toby Keith, or David Allen Coe, as Metrosexual pansies? </p>

		<p>As someone who converted to Islam at age 19 and back to Christianity at age 23 I can say much of this is youthful rebellion as well as considered &#8220;trendy&#8221; by hipsters who have been deriding Christianity for years. I will say that the fun will all wear off by the time they are married to a Muslim husband who will abuse them and only marry them for a chance to stay in the US or UK. A convert to Islam, whether male or female, is not treated as well as someone who was born to Islam. A Muslim woman who has Muslim parents will likely have someone to back them up when they are being abused or mistreated (which is not really saying much) but a Muslim woman who is a convert will likely be married to someone who just wants a condoned sex partner or a way to stay in a western country. A convert Male will likely not be allowed to marry anyone who is not a convert and Muslims often use male converts to commit terrorist acts. As for the women being somewhat less than attractive this is often true as well. I managed to get myself in shape and get out of the trap that is Islam. If these women dont they will likely be victims of serial marriage- a Muslim man will marry them, have a couple of kids and then leave when he has permanent residency. She will then be moved on to another Muslim man who will do the same thing. By the time she is 40 she will be considered washed up since youth and fertility are prized in Islam, without Muslim parents of siblings to back her up she will end up alone and possibly without some of her kids. </p>

		<p>Wait until these silly women find out converting to Islam is NOT like their other faddish ideas - far different from Wicca or New Age or whatever other &#8220;spiritual&#8221; experimentation they&rsquo;ve engaged in.  Once IN, NEVER OUT.  Once they convert and embrace Islam, they are subject to violence and even murder for trying to escape it or &#8220;de-convert&#8221; from it.  Much has to do, I think, with the idea expressed here about women seeking strong men, or capitulating to and giving their favors to, the conqueror.  They recognize that apparently the average British male is too wimpy to stand up for his way of life, his nation, and his women - so they go to those whom they see winning the battle - and necessarily convert.  But they really haven&rsquo;t thought it through.  They are now Muslim.  They will NEVER be allowed to change their mind.</p>

		<p>One does not have to convert to Islam to escape consumerism, sexual immorality, drunkenness, etc.  It&rsquo;s all about individual choices  &mdash;  and it&rsquo;s my choice to dress modestly, not to drink, not to engage in immoral conduct, not to watch television.  I don&rsquo;t need a religion to tell me how to behave, though I credit a Christian upbringing with instilling these values.</p>
<p>But to the point, I have to agree with poster 16  &mdash;  many (if not most) of these women enjoy the trappings.  It&rsquo;s the attention!  I&rsquo;ve seen it played out so many times.  It doesn&rsquo;t have to be Islam, it could be any other trend  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve seen girls change to become Wiccans, Hindus, gay, and even hard-core vegetarians.  One thing they all have in common is that very obvious attitude of moral superiority to all the unenlightened ones in their midst.  And these people are never happy with themselves  &mdash;  they tend to be the homely and oddball sorts. So the &#8216;conversion&rsquo; will last till the next trendy, &#8216;cool&rsquo; thing comes along that will make them feel oh, so special and garner renewed attention.  Lost souls, that&rsquo;s my opinion.</p>

<p>Too bad you are only 50% correct!  Wicca is well known to be a European, pre-Christian indigenous form, as is Gaiaism, which is simply a modern term for the more matriarchal pre-Christian European form that existed in most regions of Europe, as earth based religions observing planetary movements, seasons. etc. Those two and a few other forms like Asatru, reigned in Europe for somewhere between 40-50 thousand years.  Many whites are moving back to pre-Christian European spiritual forms and I think that this is a great thing for the white race.  This continued misinformation and incorrect assumptions such as the ones made above are a good illustration of why such arguments gain no traction with anyone with much education in European history or culture. </p>
<p>The white women this article illustrates represents a historical trend.  Roman women converted to Christianity and before that even Judaism, when it was still an outside &#8220;Oriental&#8221; religion.  Nero&rsquo;s niece is known to have converted to Judaism, which was respected as a very old religious form in those times.  Women have always acted this way, affecting their societies through personal acts like this and other subtle anti-establishment acts, such as marrying rejected male.  There may be a biological reason for this, but that it has always occurred and undeniable.</p>
<p>I have seen films of a few of these British women converting.  Many of them, the youngest are usually from disfunctional homes. They usually have a Muslim friend and they see how happy they are with their family, etc.  The contrast between the usual tight-knit immigrant family and the more laxidasical style they see in their working class lives stands out to them.  I saw one young woman converted.  She was saying yes to conditions that were read so quickly that no one, unless already very familiar with the material could have known what they were agreeing to. The &#8220;ceremony&#8221; was finished within a couple minutes.  In Islam, all that is required is an acknowledging of Allah to be considered converted.  It is cheaply done.  I think that these women convert out of boredom, lonliness, and to feel relevant and important.  It is more like joining a club, done with less consideration than in a Las Vegas wedding.  Meanwhile the state is pushing everyone toward miscegenation.  I think that many Western governments think that the end result will be a dulling of Islamic fundamentalism, and a concurrent defeat of nationalism, which they think will benefit commerce and the tax base as a result.  I think they have tragically miscalculated how far they can stretch the social fabric.</p>
<p>I have had a couple of online arguments with these women.  They are so naive it is pathetic.  That they are sold on the idea of Multiculturalism is obvious because they cite it as if it were a religious state faith.  When I ask them how Multicultural the spouses own nation of origin is, they have no answer and the conversation usually ends.</p>
<p>Religions have always preyed upon the most mentally and spiritually vulnerable.  That women comprise a high number of these people should come as no surprise.  The ability of a convert, a new &#8220;true believer&#8221; to ignore contradictions and obvious problems of their new faith is just as common in Christianity - perhaps more so, than in any cult in existence.  That tendency is abundantly evident in Amren posts on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Worship based on the seasons and agricultural cycles at least makes some rational sense.  Decorating it with gods and goddesses is art as far as I am concerned, and makes the whole thing nice and comfy, like a thatched farmhouse in the Cotswolds.  These others, especially the three main Middle Eastern religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are full of fear and guilt and manipulation of the spirit with their Satan and hellfire and this God with all his conditions, and believers are appropriately called &#8220;sheep.&#8221;  Christianity and Islam want to convert the entire world, accepting converts from all races and ethnic groups.  Any white who think Christianity is a white Western religion is simply deluded.  I think that any white who wants to see their race survive must be willing to let any involvement with these neurotic religious forms go first because they hold us back in so many ways.<br>

		<p>Wait a minute, with more white converts, maybe they will soften the rough edges of the Moslem community there and it will actually benefit all of us.  </p>
<p>As a long time student of religion, I can tell you that Islam is basically a hybrid of Judaism and Christianity.  Nothing particularly alien about it in pure philosophical terms.  Most &#8216;Moslems&rsquo; out there actually follow their culture of machismo and superstition that is oftentimes not a part of their religion.</p>

<p>I certainly agree with that theory, I&rsquo;d say with the vast majority of these young women it is basic attention-seeking. The &#8216;sense of moral superiority over others&rsquo; along with the attention they will get must make them feel great&hellip;until that feeling wears off and they need to &#8216;find&rsquo; something else.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the old &#8216;guilty conscience&rsquo; at work here too. Too much &#8216;partying&rsquo;; the dead end of being addicted to misbehaviour that is &#8216;cured&rsquo; by some sort of religious conversion, and these days it seems that Islam is &#8216;cooler&rsquo; than born-again Christianity.<br>

		<p>I am very glad to see that most (not all) of the comments above consist of constructive criticism instead of the constant white female bashing that these articles tend to bring about on here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t respect feminism in any way, shape, or form, and I agree that it is destructive to society. But I also think white males are as equally to blame as white females are when it comes to the destruction of white society.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree that women tend to be more naive and less rational than men, but that tends to be women of every race. That is just how women are in general biologically. We tend to be followers, and we don&rsquo;t always think as critically as men do. We weren&rsquo;t made to. We were made to tend to children and tend to the home.</p>
<p>I find it funny how a lot of times on this website men will use articles like this as an opportunity to ridicule the &#8220;stupidity of white women&#8221;, when the fact of the matter is that statistics show that Asian and hispanic women (in this country) are much more likely to marry outside their race than white women. So before you brag on your wonderful Asian wives that you felt pressured to marry because of a &#8220;lack of white women&#8221;, please remember that your nonwhite wives are commiting the same offense that you accuse white women of.</p>
<p>So I applaud MOST of the comments above for not going into that.</p>
<p>As for me,&hellip;..I am still young and hardly desperate, and I plan on marrying a white man who acts masculine and appreciates my femininity. I hardly have to look to Islam for that. I can look in a Baptist church or in an NRA club for that.</p>

<p>To those, I&rsquo;ll add that Islam has become the de facto official religion of public/state schools in the US and UK, so it might be that white people (not just women) are latching on to it in order to be teachers pets.</p>

		<p>I think people here generally understand why young women would become Muslims. It also has an &#8220;ew&#8221; factor, since converting to something else, such as Eastern Orthodoxy, or traditional Roman Catholicism (which is now quite different from the mainstream watered-down gay-friendly version from which Tony Blair&rsquo;s sister-in-law converted) isn&rsquo;t seen as particularly shocking. Converting to these two more patriarchal strains of Christianity is fairly common in Britain and other parts of formerly Protestant Europe, but nobody hears about it.</p>

		<p>People (men or women) don&rsquo;t want to be caught on the losing side of history. When the only socially acceptable sides are effete liberalism and Islamic extremism, and the former has as one of its tenets that it is not supposed to oppose the latter (or, at least, the policies that bring it into western society), then it&rsquo;s fairly obvious who the losers will be. These converts to Islam see, correctly, that the current liberal establishment in their country cannot win in a conflict with Islamists, and so have joined the winning side. Expect to see more of this as Europe gets more Islamicized. Indeed, the muslims probably won&rsquo;t need to wait to become a majority by immigration and births, because so many native Europeans will simply impose it on themselves, if current trends continue.</p>

<p>You want strict religious rules?  You want to live within a definite format? You can become a Mormon. You can become a nun. You don&rsquo;t have to be a Moslem.</p>
<p>I recall a splendid movie I saw years ago  [<i>In This House of Brede </i>(1975) ]  starring Diana Rigg as a successful,  high-powered corporate executive.     Nonethless,  despite all her &#8220;success&#8221; in the business world,   she felt something lacking in her life and she decided (to the shock of all those around her) to give all that up power and money  and to enter a convent as a nun.  This was the fulfillment  and lifestyle that she had been seeking.  It wouldn&rsquo;t work for all, obviously,  but it worked for her.  To each, a different drummer.  </p>
<p>So many excellent posts above!   I especially enjoyed Kitty&rsquo;s  shrewd observations about <i> &#8220;their very obvious attitude of moral superiority to all the unenlightened ones in their midst.&#8221;</i>  And Spartaan24&rsquo;s revelations that a convert is never fully the equal of a born Moslem, and that when abuse happens  she will have no relatives to protect her.  And that by age 40 she&rsquo;ll likely  be washed up and abandoned.</p>
<p>Also Georgia Resident&rsquo;s canny observation that:  <i> &#8220;People (men or women) don&rsquo;t want to be caught on the losing side of history. &hellip; These converts to Islam see, correctly, that the current establishment in their country cannot win in a conflict with Islamists, so they have joined the winning side.&#8221;  </i></p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s always a strong incentive to go with a winner.  It&rsquo;s like the desire to get in on the ground floor with some hot new rising stock   &mdash;   like Xerox in the 1960s.  Or with a rising politician destined for the White House.  At present, the Christian churches in Europe are clearly seen as  wimpish  losers.  And nobody loves a loser. These opportunistic women are selling  out to what they perceive as the winning team.  They are betting on the future.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope they&rsquo;re all wrong and live to regret it!</p>
