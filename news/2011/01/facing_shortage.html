<h1><a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2011/01/10/edca0110.htm">Facing Shortage, We Can&rsquo;t Just Pull Doctors out of a Hat</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p><b>The shortages</b></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it currently stacks up:</p>
<p>* We anticipate a deficiency of at least 125,000 physicians by 2025.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* There still is a primary care shortage  &mdash;  at least partially because pay differentials for primary care physicians make it even more difficult to repay medical school debts, which average $155,000.</p>
<p>* We see an even larger shortage in the Hispanic, black and other minority communities  &mdash;  partly because of high medical school costs but also because there are few role models for those kids.<br>
{snip}</p>
<p><b>Medical education and training</b></p>
<p>Although medical school tuition remains a huge stumbling block, especially for minorities, first-year medical students are on the increase  &mdash;  predicted to be up 21% by 2013 over 2009. Many programs are growing; moreover, nearly two dozen new medical schools have opened, sought accreditation or been announced in the past three years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Increasing minority physicians</b></p>
<p>Underrepresented minorities in the ranks of physicians  &mdash;  only 6% compared with 30% of the overall population  &mdash;  is another problem that will only grow as our current minority groups swell to dominate the population by 2050.</p>
<p>On the upside, the AAMC has a major initiative to increase minority enrollment.</p>
<p>Since 2002 the AMA has sponsored Doctors Back to School, a mentoring program that sends minority physicians into schools to share their stories, serve as role models and raise awareness about the need for more minorities in medicine. In 2010, nearly 250 physicians participated. The AMA Foundation is one of many organizations that offer scholarships to minority medical students.</p>
<p>Individual medical schools also have initiatives to encourage minority physicians. Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., sponsors a summer program designed to encourage black, Hispanic and Native American high school and college students to pursue medical careers. In Illinois, the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine&rsquo;s Academic Medicine Program helps disadvantaged college students get the credentials needed for medical school applications.</p>

		<p>The writer makes the common error in thinking minority doctors all have a burning desire to attend to the needs of the people who look like them. In reality most look to go where they can make some money, preferably more upscale hospitals and clinics, offices in nicer areas, etc. They go to school to put some distance between themselves and the poorer areas, not to stay there. They want to live the good life, not play missionary. The majority of doctors in the downscale and ghetto neighborhoods are foreign born; they seem to be the main ones willing to work there.</p>

		<p>So, we bring 50 million Third Worlders into the USA, and then we need to bring in another 25 million to serve as physicians, dentists, nurses, teachers, coaches, attorneys, judges, police, spiritual advisers, and on, and on, and on, for these immigrants, because it is absolutely essential that they interact with &#8220;people who look like them&#8221;.  </p>
<p>If they needed and desired &#8220;people who look like them,&#8221; then why did they come?  Back in their own country, they had &#8220;people who looked like them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fewer non-white doctors (Meaning black doctors of course.)because costs and no role models?</p>
<p>How about fewer qualified people who are competent and dedicated enough to complete the training?  Isn&rsquo;t that what the problem really is?</p>
<p>But, I&rsquo;m surprsed Cecil B above didn&rsquo;t know that the lefties included a mandate in the healthcare bill dictating requirements for quotas for non-whites, which translates specifically to black privilege, because all the other races can provide competent prospective doctors.</p>
<p>If blacks AA grads would stay in their own areas I have no problem with it, but, like everything else, they&rsquo;ll complain about not having enough of them throughout the general population and some of us may be unfortunate enough to wake up on a gurney after an accident and see a black face behind a surgical mask, reducing the chances of our survival considerably. </p>

Ah of course a lack of role models is the real problem, because as we all know looking at the TV/movies/media there is a very large shortage of blacks and mexicans portrayed as doctors and lawyers.</p>

		<p>Yes, let the afrovoodoos have their own doctors, witch doctors and hoodoo is good enough for them.  White doctors should never be allowed to help blacks.  Why waste the best talent trying to raise the lowest?  All you do is let them pull you down.</p>

		<p>Poster #5 hit the nail on the head.  You cannot turn on a TV show these days without prominent black leadership figures.  </p>
<p>&#8220;House&#8221; has a couple, who are presented as brilliant.  Other shows all have black supervisors, lawyers, politicos and on and on.</p>
<p>That older show called &#8220;the Guardian&#8221; has a ration of 3:1 in favor of blacks being the judges.  All those crime shows usually have white males as the criminals and blacks as the sympathy characters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure BET TV has plenty of role models, and besides, in black (and latino) areas there are usually few whites around at all, so they see people who look like them all the time.</p>
<p>What about young white boys.  It is almost universal now that the &#8220;white guy&#8221; in movies and on TV is presented as a bumbling idiot (who needs to be saved by the savvy woman or streetsmart minority).</p>
<p>I just am sorry that I will be an old man by the time 2050 rolls around.  I imagine being in a hospital bed in a facility full of other old, dying whites, while the 100% non-white staff goes about its business of shucking and jiving and neglecting us.  Who will me doctor be?  A texting addicted affirmative action hire?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a veteran - a Vietnam veteran! I served my country honorably and was even awarded the &#8220;Army Commendation Medal&#8221;! I Left the Army after four years as a decorated &#8220;Sergant!&#8221; I recall when I was a senior in high school the day that an Army recruiter was standing outside of the cafeteria and pulled me aside and said &#8220;you are such a strong and strapping young fellow!&#8221; &#8220;You should consider joining the Army!&#8221; He then began to tell me about all the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of being a soldier. One of the most memorable things he said was &#8220;you will receive medical care for the rest of your life!&#8221; I was already &#8220;pre-disposed&#8221; to joining the army because most every relative of mine had done so. I don&rsquo;t know why, but that &#8220;medical care for life&#8221; stuck with me! As a young man in the Army I received the care you would expect for a 20 yar old - occasional sprained ankles, perhaps a sinus infection, and that was it! Then came the &#8220;post service&#8221; care at the Veterans Hospital. At first - it was nothing. I was still a young man - in my 20&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s. Then came my father&rsquo;s experience! My father went to the VA in 1985 for a hip replacement. By that time the VA had already begun to &#8220;import&#8221; doctors. The attending physician for my fathers hip replacement was from Kenya. The result? He began to have severe pain! This lasted for two years. After the pain got so bad that he could not stand it - he went to a private physician. The doctor told him that he had a serious infection in the socket that was replaced by the Kenyan doctor! He told my father that there was a serious risk that if he went in there and tried to correct it the infection could spread and kill him. Of course, my father didn&rsquo;t let us know of his dire condition. He went in for sugery and, as expected, the infection spread and killed him! <br>
In later years, as my age progressed and I started to have more serious health problems, I encountered a new and more dangerous problem at the VA - AFFIRMATIVE ACTION! My first real encounter with it was in 1992 when I went into the emergency room at the Atlanta VA with severe abdominal cramps and pain. I was diagnosed to have &#8220;acute appendicitis&#8221; - by a black physician - and was immediately placed on a gurney and scheduled for surgery! I was even admitted to the hospital and assigned a room! Fortunately, another (white, might I say) Doctor was in the room and said - &#8220;Hold on a minute, let me see that chart!&#8221; He suggested that I be sent to the sonogram lab! Well, I went to the sonogram lab, and guess what - I was full of gas! Yes gas! All I needed to do was let a big &#8220;FART!&#8221; It didn&rsquo;t stop there! In 1996 I was involved in a car crash that left me with herniated discs and busted knees. At first I went to a private physician who did MRI&rsquo;s and determined that I had two herniated discs in my back and a torn meniscus in my knee. When I learned that the person who hit me was uninsured I was forced to go to the VA for further treatment. What a joke - the VA &#8220;Doctor&#8221; did not even look at the private physicians MRI&rsquo;s and did not even read his diagnosis or prognosis. She said &#8220;we cannot look at second party medical findings!&#8221; All this woman with a red dot( I kid you not - she had a red dot on her forehead) did was say &#8220;I am unbelieavable, you need disability!&#8221; Then she sent me to physical therapy where they told me to &#8220;sleep with a pillow under my legs&#8221; and &#8220;don&rsquo;t try to lift too much!&#8221; Since then I have developed high blood pressure, arthritis, and a bad case of seborreich keratosis (spell check fails on this one)! The last time I went to one of their clinics they had a substitute doctor who appeared to be from, you guessed it, KENYA! Guess what this clown recommedned? He said I should be evaluated by &#8220;MENTAL HEALTH! RIGHT! Like I&rsquo;m going to let the VA evaluate my mental health! <br>
I think you get my point after all my blathering! God help you if you have to see a &#8220;Minority Doctor!&#8221; Your life could be on the line!</p>

In Illinois, the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine&rsquo;s Academic Medicine Program helps disadvantaged college students get the credentials needed for medical school applications.<br>
=====================</p>
<p>First, if your future doctor needs to go to a summer program to figure out just exactly &#8220;what be medicine?&#8221; you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>Next, why on earth would anyone encourage a college student deemed &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; to go to medical school? The U of Chicago program appears designed to help those students &#8220;get the credentials needed for medical school applications.&#8221; If you need help figuring out how to simply apply to medical school then you really shouldn&rsquo;t go to medical school in the first place.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; can mean anything. Of course, here it means blacks with low cognitive skills. </p>
<p>This is the destruction of medicine. You are taking (wasting) piles of money that could go to train the best so you can go on an urban safari to find and accept unworthy applicants based solely on race who will eventually dumb down the profession - not to mention kill people. </p>
<p>This is insane. I&rsquo;m sorry if DeShaun or Taniqua has a 2.6 GPA and a 23 MCAT score - find another line of work. If DeShaun had 3.7 GPA and a 34 MCAT - great - he can apply like everyone else.  </p>
<p>Can you see this happening in China or Japan?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a physician and I&rsquo;ve been in practice for 21 years so don&rsquo;t get me started on this. I&rsquo;ve seen first-hand what you can expect from our affirmative action colleagues.</p>
<p>If this keeps up, in 30 years health care will mean &#8220;each man for himself.&#8221; And good luck getting an appointment with a white doctor. At least we&rsquo;ll be busy - unless the system is totally government controlled and private practice outlawed.</p>
<p>Lastly, it&rsquo;s possible - in the future - that somewhere, in a  Caribbean island country or a central American nation, that a large medical center(s) will arise staffed only by white physicians where one can go for the best care - if you have the money. </p>
<p>The day-to-day primary/preventive issues can be managed by tele-medicine and if things get more complicated - you can fly south for treatment. That&rsquo;s assuming, of course, the government will let you check out of Affirmative Action Memorial Hospital.</p>

Splendid! Yes, by all means, let&rsquo;s do everything we can to get into the medical profession as many people who historically have shown no interest in nor aptitude for medicine! It&rsquo;s in our national interest to place in life-or-death decision-making positions, the most unsuitable people we can find! And all just to make the racial bean-counters happy!</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ll be jobs waiting for every one of these new physicians at St. God&rsquo;s Memorial Hospital:</p>

		<p>after several decades of enrolling and graduating black students with scores that are LOWER than the whites they reject, the faculty of Harvard Medical School is still only 2.6% black.</p>
<p>the above writers is basically calling for millions of substandard minority physicians to treat minorities.</p>
<p>he will probably get his way.</p>
<p>affluent whites will continue to use white and Asian doctors, a large proportion of them Jewish, just as they have done in the past.</p>
<p>someone should do a survey of wealthy white (and black) progressives:<br>
how many have African-American physicians?</p>
<p>not even the Obamas have been willing to take such a risk with their family&rsquo;s health (the Obama family physician for 20 + years prior to his election was Jewish).</p>
<p>ask the next progressive you meet how many doctors here she has had in his or her lifetime, and how many of them have been black.</p>
<p>ironically, the above plan for minority physicians for minorities is quite blatantly based on the principle of &#8220;separate but equal&#8221;.</p>
<p>speaking from experience, I&rsquo;m going to let all of you in on a dirty little secret:<br>
when it comes to race and intelligence, ALL progressives, black and white, are deliberately and consciously lying 24 hours of the day.</p>

<p>A whitey doctor cannot treat a &#8220;minority&#8221;? &#8220;Minorities&#8221; think and are afraid that the whitey doctor might try to do a Tuskegee &#8220;experiment&#8221; [study] on them? Is that it?</p>

		<p>I knew a guy about ten years ago who ran a telemarketing company that worked exclusively for headhunters who served the medical community. He told me that most of his clients preferred American staff, so whenever they would call doctors who were about to finish their fellowships at hospitals they were instructed to determine if the doctor held a J-2 visa. If they did have a J-2 visa then his telemarketers were instructed to politely end the call as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the part that makes my fists clench and causes my eyes to glow like coals in the deepest pits of hell. If doctors with J-2 visas do not have employment in the field they were trained in by the time they complete their fellowship they have to leave the U.S. for two years due to some protectionist lobbying on the part of the A.M.A.</p>
<p>That is one of the stupidest immigration rules that I have ever heard of. We have thousands diseased, unskilled Mexicans crawling across the border like roaches every night and we have a government that, with open arms, welcomes boatloads of semi-retarded sub-Saharan Black refugees at the same time we are chasing off intelligent, competent doctors from India and other parts of Asia.</p>
<p>We have under-served pockets all over rural America as well as doctor shortages in our inner-cities, so why are we giving the boot to doctors who were trained right here in America? </p>
<p>According to my telemarketing acquaintance, those doctors with the J-2&rsquo;s start sweating toward the end of their fellowships. I&rsquo;m sure they would agree to put it a couple of years at a walk-in clinic in a half dead coal town to avoid getting sent home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for putting American workers first when it comes to building cars and buildings, but I think it is foolish to extend that sentiment to doctors at a time when there is a shortage of them.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t want to underestimate the negative impact that Afirmative Action will continue to have on the quality of healthcare.  A few years ago I tried to save a buck and use my Costco membership for an eye exam.  The tiny doctors office at the Costco had a black woman receptionist.  Sure enough, a black eye doctor named Renaldo awaited me in the back. I walked out soon thereafter, new prescription in hand.  <br>
My upscale eyeglass lense provider filled the prescription.  The new lenses were off by a mile.  My optometrist was kind enough to comp me a replacement pair after I&rsquo;d visit a competent doctor.  I should have trusted my insticts and gracefully excused myself from Renaldo&rsquo;s office prior to his exam.  Lesson learned.</p>

		<p>Just lower the standards and we will get more! Tsk tsk, all of these &ldquo;educational requirements&rdquo; were put in place by the white man to put down the poor black man.</p>
<p>Being young, I plan to grow medicinal herbs and gain a better understanding, so then I can reduce my need to visit these future &ldquo;doctors&rdquo;. <br>

		<p>A while back I was in a hospital in the Bronx on buisness. There was a film crew on scene.The man in charge of recruiting doctors was spouting off about the quality of his recruits.He was Indian. Turns out that the class of recruits was 90% Desai. there were a few blacks from the Caribbean and one white in the 30 odd group.Of couse all of them were being subsidized by the taxpayer. How many white kids were denied those positions? We, who invented modern health care are now too stupid to be doctors, it seems.Who knew?</p>

		<p>I wanted to become a physician all of my life, my childhood through the first years of college when the realization came to me that I would either destroy my parents&rsquo; retirement or, burden my own life and beginning family with such high debt that it would take Heaven and earth to pay off the student loans.  I would have made a good physician.  I would have been the original &#8220;House&#8221;.  My years of paying for premed spent in working in a hospital, I was learning medicine by discussing cases with all staff physicians, nurses, and paramedics.  I even earned the nickname of &#8220;Doc&#8221;.  My enrollment in ROTC, even though I was a little older than most, wouldn&rsquo;t go anywhere.  A back injury saw to that.  So, the chance of a scholarship, maybe just a slim chance, was worth a try.  After all, I already knew that just being a National Merit finalist meant nothing, for I was a white male at just the wrong time in our country&rsquo;s history.  Long story short, I couldn&rsquo;t get anything close to the needed $250k in 1970&rsquo;s dollars, probably close to 3/4 of a million today.  Thereafter, attempts at jobs with the Post Office and other mundane but reasonable attempts to feed my family, I worked three horrible jobs to make enough to at least earn a masters degree and to go on in life as a faceless, yet hard working wage earner.  I always wondered what good I could have done as a physician but now in my senior years I just hope my white children will not let their &#8220;whiteness&#8221; become a handicap to becoming what they can be.</p>

		<p>When the average person thinks of a doctor they think of CSI or invasive, life or death, surgeries. Most who graduate from medical school end up in a very narrow specialty field, having nothing to do with surgery, or end up as a general practitioner running tests on regular patients and sending the results off to other clinics, or even as salesmen working for medical companies. </p>

		<p>I worked in a hospital for 22 years ands one thing that always stood out in my mind was blacks and minority types ALWAYS demanded white doctors. blacks themselves feel the fact that black doctors are less qualified and AA approved in most cases were substandard in their qualifications. I hate to sound racist because that is the worst think a white person can be in America today but the black doctors were little more than jokes. Anyone who would allow one of these doctors (so to speak) to touch them needed to have their head examined?</p>

<p>&#8220;The writer makes the common error in thinking minority doctors all have a burning desire to attend to the needs of the people who look like them. In reality most look to go where they can make some money, preferably more upscale hospitals and clinics, offices in nicer areas, etc. They go to school to put some distance between themselves and the poorer areas, not to stay there. They want to live the good life, not play missionary. The majority of doctors in the downscale and ghetto neighborhoods are foreign born; they seem to be the main ones willing to work there.&#8221;</p>
<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p> Minorities will get first choice at prime hospitals because of the need for diversity. The increased salary will help offset the cost of malpractice insurance that they will surly need. The whites will get stuck working for peanuts at community hospitals serving the minority community. </p>
<p> I have had more than my (un)fair share of minority doctors. They can&rsquo;t even fill out a proper prescription form, nor can they figure out that refills are required when the original amount runs out. I was also confused at how one minority doctor taking to me about my pregnancy. I said &#8220;how can I be pregnant, I&rsquo;m a man.&#8221; He then said he was sorry, that he thought I was his last patient. They really hate and have deep contempt for whites.</p>

		<p>I currently drive 20 miles each way to get prenatal care at a community hospital so that I am assured that I will have a White doctor and majority White hospital staff. I know for a fact that if I was in a large hospital and had the gall to request a white doctor I would get some sort of lecture and possibly have my chart flagged. A minority would instantly recieve another minority medical staff. </p>

		<p>In the Bakke supreme court case, five black applicants with lower scores than Bakke were admitted to med school and he wasn&rsquo;t.  Google the career of one of the five applicants, Dr. Patrick Chavis.  I used to go to an office here in Queens, New York where there were a lot of foreign doctors.  I finally had to ask for appointments with doctors who spoke English, or at least a form of English I could understand.</p>

		<p>Few people realize what healthcare of the future will be like under Obamacare or government-run healthcare.   You won&rsquo;t be seen by an M.D. anymore.  You will likely be seen by a P.A. (Physician&rsquo;s Assistant) or N.P. (Nurse Practitioner) who will likely be Filipino, Hispanic or some other minority.  These non-M.D.-medical-personnel cost less to hire than M.D.&rsquo;s. The doctors who supervise these non-M.D. medical personnel will likely be FMG&rsquo;s (Foreign Medical Graduates) from India or other Third World countries because, again, they&rsquo;re cheaper.   Government healthcare is all about saving money (aka rationing) at the patient&rsquo;s expense.  White patients (especially the elderly white) will be getting substandard care which will lead to an increase in the death rate.</p>

		<p>The pro-immigration lobby in most western countries harps on about labour shortages but in most areas where whites are in the vast majority, there aren&rsquo;t any big labour shortages. If major shortages of doctors or teachers, or other public service workers exist, it is usually in areas with high numbers of NAMs because non-Asian minorities are unable to produce enough of their own doctors or teachers.</p>
<p>As far as AA goes, all AA students should be bonded to areas where there are genuine shortages only. AA isn&rsquo;t just supposed to help the minority elite, it&rsquo;s supposed to help poorer ethnicities as a group.</p>

		<p>All I see in America is NONwhite doctors and nurses!  Kaiser where I live, is full of them! I cannot find even ONE White doctor who works at Kaiser and I think all the other HMO&rsquo;s are the same. I cannot even understand the words many of them are saying, let alone trust them with my healthcare. I truly believe they do NOT have my best interest at heart when it comes to my health. Call me crazy, but that is a fact, and I do not care how much they smile, show &#8220;concern&#8221;, I know that they all are for their own race of people and NONE are for the White race.</p>
