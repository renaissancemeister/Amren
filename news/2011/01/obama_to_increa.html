<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2219808&amp;nid=104">Obama to Increase Engagement With Africa in 2011</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Pace, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), January 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama is quietly but strategically stepping up his outreach to Africa, using this year to increase his engagement with a continent that is personally meaningful to him and important to U.S. interests.</p>
<p>Expectations in Africa spiked after the election of an American president with a Kenyan father. But midway through his term, Obama&rsquo;s agenda for Africa has taken a backseat to other foreign policy goals, such as winding down the Iraq war, fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan and resetting relations with Russia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a blunt speech before the Ghanaian parliament [in 2009], Obama said democracy is the key to Africa&rsquo;s long-term development.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the ingredient which has been missing in far too many places, for far too long,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;That is the change that can unlock Africa&rsquo;s potential. And that is a responsibility that can only be met by Africans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The White House says Obama will travel to Africa again and the political calendar means the trip will almost certainly happen this year, before Obama has to spend more time on his re-election bid. No decision has been made on which countries Obama will visit, but deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said stops will reflect positive democratic models.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rhodes said the White House understands that U.S. involvement in African politics can be viewed as meddling. But he said Obama can speak to African leaders with a unique level of candor, reflecting his personal connection to Africa and that his father and other family members have been affected by the corruption that plagues many countries there.</p>
<p>Officials also see increased political stability in Africa as good for long-term U.S. interests  &mdash;  a way to stem the growth of terrorism in east Africa and counterbalance China&rsquo;s growing presence on the continent.</p>

		<p>So Obama has a special blackness that allows him to talk freely with other blacks. I remember when the same media made fun of the presidents initiatives towards Africa, when it was George Bush Sr who was president. He couldn&rsquo;t be seen as a white person even talking to other whites in Africa. How quickly they forget the USA was the first country to overthrow European colonial power, enforced the Monroe doctrine, and was vocal in opposition to European interference in Africa. By the 1960&rsquo;s the smart people were declaring the USA was a colonial power and the main purveyor of &#8216;imperialism&rsquo; and that Western medicine did not eradicate smallpox but instead Westerners, and Westerners alone, spread disease as part of their warfare against non-whites.</p>

<p>The community organizer spent twenty plus years concentrating only on black issues.  That he would continue in that mode is expected.</p>
<p>Almost everything he does is prompted by his desire to assist blacks in any way he can and to hell with the other races in this country.</p>
<p>Like all blacks everywhere, especially the ones in Congress, Obama gives black interests priority over everything else, including the betterment and welfare of other races in the US.</p>
<p>So, if this community organizer has assisting all blacks everywhere in the world as the top item on his agenda, isn&rsquo;t that why he wanted to be president?  Is his biased agenda and policy a surprise to anyone?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surpised if he hasn&rsquo;t already funnelled stimulus money into the Chicago neighborhoods he worked in, as well as Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s church.</p>

		<p>We all know that by &#8220;engagement,&#8221; he means money. And with all the surplus in the budget, why not?</p>
<p>He has shown repeatedly that his only interest is in indigenous people. I agree that he was brought up as, and still is, a marxist, but a big part of that is anti-colonial sentiment.</p>

<p>Why? Did they elect him too?  What are they expecting? Unless all national leaders have African roots, African countries cannot establish foreign policy?</p>
<p>&#8220;Africa has taken a backseat to other foreign policy goals.&#8221; </p>
<p>And so it should. Africa is a huge continent, not a country. Is Obama going to visit all 53 African nations?</p>

		<p>Start being more candid with African leaders by telling Robert Mugabe to stop killing his own people and leave &#8220;office&#8221;. Go and go now. There is where a &#8220;start&#8221; can be had. Start with Rhodesia and work from there.</p>

		<p>The US always demand that their 3rd World clients accept democracy and human rights. Russia &amp; China dont &amp; wont, so Barry&rsquo;s outreach to his pure-blooded kin will fail because the US isn&rsquo;t the only superpower anymore</p>

<p><br>
He&rsquo;ll only be stopping in &#8220;model democracies&#8221;? Well that should make for a very short trip. Other than Orania, where else is there in Africa that qualifies?</p>

		<p>Racial, I mean personal connection.  Gee, is this a racial connection?  And if so, if Boehner goes to (name a western European country here), then would that be racist?  Of course.  Ah, the upside down world of being White.</p>
