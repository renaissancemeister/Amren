<h1>Democrats Losing Too Many White Voters, Says Civil Rights Leader</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean J. Miller, The Hill, January 18 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an interview, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said Democrats need to &#8220;go all out&#8221; to win back white Southern voters before the next election.</p>
<p>White voters preferred Republican candidates by almost two-to-one in the midterms last year. Their support helped the GOP win 22 seats in the states that make up the Old Confederacy. The Democrats&rsquo; only pickup in the region was the New Orleans district where the party holds a registration advantage. </p>
<p>Since November, there have been a string of defections by Southern Democratic state lawmakers, which has prompted renewed speculation about the party&rsquo;s future in the region. Former Alabama Rep. Artur Davis (D) said Democrats should even consider running as Independents if they want to succeed. </p>
<p>Lewis, who was a civil rights activist before being elected to Congress in 1986, said he&rsquo;s concerned the party is losing its diversity, which will make it difficult to reclaim the lost seats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to go all out and get white voters, especially white men, to come back to the Democratic Party,&#8221; he told The Ballot Box. &#8220;I just think it&rsquo;s important for the Democratic Party to roll out and try to reveal itself and not become a party that is split along racial lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2010, he was not only not on the ticket, but really wasn&rsquo;t being welcomed around, and so in a way he was kind of muted in being able to control what he is so good at. I think the fact that he is controlling his message [in 2012] will be helpful to Democrats and possibly bring more white voters to the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama won the White House in 2008 with the support of more white voters than Sen. John Kerry (Mass.), the previous Democratic presidential nominee, attracted in 2004. </p>
<p>Moreover, Obama was more popular than Kerry with whites in North Carolina and Virginia, two Southern states he won in the general election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In last year&rsquo;s midterm election, white voters favored the GOP by a margin of 60 percent to 37, according to the national exit poll conducted by Edison Research. It was a higher percentage than the margin claimed by the GOP during its 1994 landslide victory.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African-Americans remain the core of the Democratic Party&rsquo;s Southern base. But the recent election of two Southern black Republicans to the House raised the possibility that even the party&rsquo;s core support is shaky. </p>

Let&rsquo;s see. They pander and cater to minorities while they vilify anyone white or any white group that has different opinions.</p>
<p>The Democrats are driving whites away. The question is, can the Democrats pander and cater to whites without being perceived as pro-white and anti-minority? The answer is no.</p>
<p>Talk about walking a tightrope.</p>

		<p>Not to worry.  There is no shortage of stupid Republican politicians and pundits like Karl Rove and Newt Gingrich who will see in this trend a golden &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to expand and diversify the GOP base.  Somewhere in heaven Jack Kemp is smiling.</p>

		<p>While they may say that, and few (even those who pathologically lie) believe it, the real reason is that &#8220;minorities (which by the way have different groups)&#8221; do not have a majority. So Democrats still need to garner enough votes until they become the majority.</p>
<p>It has more to do with winning then some sense of justice.</p>
<p>The last part is interesting though about African Americans.</p>
<p>There is becoming a divergence amongst the African American community. Such divergence is expected in an ever growing dynamic of political science. Few venture out take certain core principles and put their own spin making it their own. </p>

		<p>Why should white people vote for the Anti-White Party?  Why should they vote for the party that favors anti-white discrimination and illegal immigration, and that believes whites must pay more taxes to subsidize the blacks and illegal aliens?  The only reason any whites at all vote for Democrats is because the only opposition in our so-called &#8220;democracy&#8221; is the Republicans.  The Democrats won&rsquo;t even get us out of the wars the Republicans started.  They are totally useless.</p>

This is further proof that the GOP could win big with Whites if they&rsquo;d get a backbone and stand up to the frauds of the Dem. party, starting with the CBC.   </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the trouble, Congressman Lewis.  The Democratic Party IS &#8220;revealing itself&#8221;   &mdash;  - all too well for those willing to look. Just one example: The Democrat&rsquo;s signature healthcare reform legislation. Obamacare is loaded with anti-white racial preferences. For the dispiriting details, see:</p>
<p>&#8220;Legislating Discrimination&rdquo; <br>
By Hans A. von Spakovsky<br>
NATIONAL REVIEW<br>
December 22, 2009<br>
http://tinyurl.com/34urcf8</p>
<p>EXCERPT:</p>
<p>&#8220;It directs the secretary of health and human services to award federal grants worth billions of dollars to educational institutions that train medical-service providers. However, &ldquo;priority&rdquo; for federal dollars is to be given only to those institutions offering &ldquo;preferential&rdquo; admissions to underrepresented minorities (according to race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, and religion, depending on which section of the bill you look at). Thus, schools will be unable to compete for essential federal funding unless they adopt admission policies that intentionally and deliberately discriminate. It guarantees the institution of racist and sexist quotas sanctioned and encouraged by the federal government in what Linda Chavez of the Center for Equal Opportunity correctly calls &#8216;a new racial spoils system.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bill also declares that institutions training social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, behavioral pediatricians, psychiatric nurses, and counselors will be ineligible for federal grants unless they discriminate. According to Section 756, these programs must enroll &ldquo;individuals and groups from different racial, ethnic, cultural, geographic, religious, linguistic, and class backgrounds, and different genders and sexual orientations&rdquo; and demonstrate &ldquo;knowledge and understanding of the concerns of the[se] individuals and groups.&rdquo; If the schools fail to abide by these requirements, they will be liable for &#8216;liquidated damages.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>What are the odds, Mr. Lewis, the MSM can keep this information   &mdash;   and so much more of similar character   &mdash;   from reaching white men and white women over the next two years? </p>

<p>If this typically myopic, ethnocentric black politician had any empathy or any ability to step outside of his skin for a moment, he would see how hard things are for whites   &mdash;   especially working-class whites   &mdash;   in Democratic-controlled Obamerica. If he could see it our way for a moment, he would instead wonder   &mdash;   as I do   &mdash;   how there can still be ANY white males left in the Democratic Party. I&rsquo;m amazed white Dems haven&rsquo;t ALL defected by now. </p>

		<p>Why, I thought diversity was the absence of whites so the Democrats should be so happy they are leaving the party.  Oh, lest we forget, the Democrats and their core groups need the white vote, money, and organization to win elections.  This while raking them over the coals, and passing laws and regulations that discriminate against them.  </p>
<p>Perhaps this now makes the Democrats the &#8220;stupid party&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Any white person who votes for a democrat is walking a path of ruin for his or her race. If there seems no choice then one has to think long and hard about pulling that lever.</p>
<p>The republicans have their own frightening issues but in reality, there is little choice. </p>
<p>Still, a few more years of Barak, John Lewis, and Cynthia McKinney-types and believe me, the democrat party is finished. </p>
<p>This allows a small window of time for a new party favorable to the interests of whites (and the preservation of the US) to rise. It will be based on merit and effort and the elimination of welfare and black pandering - with no quarter given to those disrespecting the law - be it of the people or of God. A party that cherishes the contribution of white people with fairness for all but a backbone of strength and unafraid of confronting racial honesty.</p>
<p>People think it will always be a two party D or R system. Wrong. A look at American history proves otherwise. The cycle is now set for an adjustment.</p>
<p>The Tea Party is the first sign of this. </p>

		<p>Right. For over a hundred years or so it was a big rarity that a Republican could ever be elected from the South to any office at all. What did they call, them, &#8220;yellow dog&#8221; or something such?</p>
<p>NOW it is mostly if not almost exclusively Republicans elected to national and state wide office except for those Southern districts gerrymandered to allow for black pols to be elected.</p>
<p>Such a marked change. Johnson was right in part. But much longer now than two generations? Going on three now?</p>

		<p>Agree with WR the elder.  It is my opinoin the DNC intends to immigrate millions more into USA for purpose  of opposing whites.<br>
The party platform created civil rights legislation and GOP bought it. The law subordinates whites to all others.  This is UN Constitutional and offends my equal rights. The DNC clearly favors usurping economy by redistribution and the taking property rights. Only commies and dictators choose such positions. Thanks to Dept of Edu there is NO Historical teaching about literal Constitution or ideological political failures of Marx/Communism. This will lead to ignorance by the next generation. It is all planned. Communism likes high turnover of population so it can keep history up to their date. <br>
I think DNC has fights very hard everyday to keep white identity supressed.</p>

		<p>Basicaly, American politics is just one giant Jesse Jackson style shake-down racket with blacks being the beneficiaries.<br>
     Yes, the whole of American poltics revolves around appeasing and pandering to a group that makes up no more than 12% of the population, and you&rsquo;ve got to hand it to them they&rsquo;ve played their hand very skillfully indeed.<br>
 The Democrats have degenerated from being the pre-Kennedy counterpoint of he Republicans (ie the party of the &#8216;ethnics&rsquo;,the Irish, the working class and the southerners) into being a rag-bag alliance of &#8216;oppressed&rsquo; special interest groups with blacks being the senior partners and running the show.<br>
 The old Democrat base of the white working class was simply not needed or wanted anymore and coldly cast out and aside into the rather unwelcoming arms of the Republicans, a party, of course, with a different class interest.<br>
  Basically race hustling (as pioneered by Kennedy and Johnson)destroyed American politics.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I just think it&rsquo;s important for the Democratic Party to roll out and try to reveal itself and not become a party that is split along racial lines&#8221;</p>
<p>But surely if there are fewer whites in the party the Democrats will become less, not more split along racial lines. I guess he can only mean one of two things-</p>
<p>-without whites, the Democrats would be split between blacks and Hispanics. And without whites, the Hispanics would dominate, and wouldn&rsquo;t care about black interests in the way whites would. So they need whites.</p>
<p>-alternatively, what he really means is not that the party cannot become split along racial lines, but that the party system cannot become split along racial lines  &mdash;  with a white Republican and a non-white Democrat party. Again, this scenario turns out bad for blacks, as they are dominant in neither party, and whites become more aware of themselves as a voting group.</p>
<p>Either way, perhaps this guy has figured out that without white patronage, blacks are screwed.</p>

		<p>John Lewis, who was a strong supporter of Hillary, stabbed her in the back to support Obama simply because he&rsquo;s black.  Black pundits like Donna Brazille and Karen Finney have said straight out that the Dem Party now has a new black-brown coalition and no longer needs or wants the old guard.

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t is totally racist to state you must go out and get a specific race of voters?  Isn&rsquo;t that also saying that there is a different result from different races; a specific difference in races that somehow matters? If race is a social construct and should be completely invisible, aren&rsquo;t we putting our foot in our own mouth to request a particular race as a goal?</p>
<p>Side note: Would someone PLEASE send Lewis a bottle of maximum strength Prozac?  That is seriously the most depressed human being I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I fully expect him to break into sobs every time I hear him speak. I want to put a gun to my head every time I see him.</p>

		<p>Of all the nerve, this is one boldface minstrel show that these folk are putting on for our amusement.  You know the old saying, &#8220;Fool me once&hellip;&#8221;, well a lot of whites became enthralled with the obama siren call.  Now their hopes have been dashed on the rocks of reality.  Perhaps if the mainstream media really lies, I mean tries, they could convince enough addled- brained whites to once again bleed dry for the good of the democrat party.

		<p>Let me see if can understand the dilemma that the DemocRat Party is currently facing.</p>
<p>Fact:  The Dems have been totally taken over, and consumed by- from top to bottom - over the last 50 odd years by the virulently anti-white, virulently anti-Western graduates of the Frankfurt School of Cultural Marxism.   Second Fact:  The GOP is almost as completely dominated by this same pack of anti-white snakes.  </p>
<p> The #1 most hated demographic group and target for destruction by the Cultural Marxist ideology are White, heterosexual males and most especially White Southern males - since they are the key architects of Western Civilization and, since the destruction of Western civilization is also a prime objective of these leftists, they must first attack the white male and remove his ability to influence or defend his culture and nation.</p>
<p>Thus, as a result of millions of white males finally waking up and noticing the cross-hairs and bulls-eye that these Cultural Marxists have painted on their backs and chests - these overall not all that bright or politically and racially savvy white males scurry over to the GOP camp, with the false idea that this neo-con poisoned and corrupted party is going to do anything that could even remotely be considered as protecting the legitimate ethnic interests of the White male architects of the West and direct descendants of the 100 percent White Founding Fathers.      Meanwhile, the undeserving recipients of this white male anger at the anti-white Democrat Party - is the equally anti-white, neo-conned, globalist, war mongering, closet open borders loving GOP who, in truth, is really a bigger and far more devious and dangerous enemy to them than the openly anti-white Democrats. </p>
<p>It might be a good time to point out that this neo-conned GOP is in the process of trying to foist the likes of Newt Gingrich upon the GOP 2012 ticket - who not only favors amnesty, but who thinks statehood for Puerto Rico would be a huge boon for the GOP in terms of new &#8220;conservative&#8221; voters.   Such a brainless move would also accelerate the reduction of the White European majority to minority status, thereby ensuring their subjugation to a permanent non-white majority rule.  Jeb Bush, Karl Rove, Dick Cheney, Dick Army, Sarah Palin and just about every other neo-conned member of the GOP favor this objective, although some are less vocal about it than others.    For an glimpse of what a white future looks like under non-white rule, study Zimbabwe - formerly known as Rhodesia.    Or, Detroit or South Central Los Angeles.  </p>
<p>Oh, and here are a few issues that the D&rsquo;s are going to have to grapple with in order to convince the White Southern males that they are truly welcome in the Democrat Party:</p>
<p>1.  Abolishing all affirmative action discrimination against white males.<br>
2.  Respecting, as opposed to ridiculing and demonizing, the White males and White females who disapprove of miscegenation and who prefer that whites date, marry and have children with other whites.    Reproductive preferences are matters that are none of the government or media&rsquo;s business and these decisions are the exclusive propriety of each and every racial group and are not grounds for criticism or ridicule - they are personal matters, period.  <br>
3.  Ending the 50 year long assault on the White European majority of this nation, which includes ceasing efforts to dispossess and reduce whites to a minority status inside the geographic territory of the United States - a nation whose 100 percent White Founding Fathers passed down to their European posterity and not to a hodge-podge collection of non-whites from every Third world backwater country on Earth.  <br>
4.  End the 50 year long assault on White Southerners who respect and admire and wish to commemorate the memories of their Confederate ancestors and to revere and cherish the symbols and traditions of their unique Southern culture and heritage.  </p>
<p>That is a short list, and there are countless others that could be cited,  but I have serious doubts that the D&rsquo;s (or, the neo-conned Rs) would be willing to adopt even one of these four simple positions.     </p>
<p>Hence, whites should flock to the American Third Party (A3P) and leave the GOP and the Dems behind for good.<br>

		<p>I see this (whites leaving the Democratic Party) as a long term and ongoing trend. Every time a white liberal gets mugged by reality, figuratively or literally, they start to question their liberal beliefs. There are lots of conservative race realists today, who were liberals at one time. When a white liberal&rsquo;s son or daughter is beaten to a pulp by a roving gang of blacks, and the perpetrators receive no more than a sentence of &#8220;community service&#8221; the fog of socialist, multi-cultural dogma begins to clear away. I think it is quite possible that less than 30% of whites will vote for Obama in the next election.</p>

		<p>Maybe the reason Dems are losing too many White voters is because White voters have had it with the myth of multi-cultural diversity being &#8220;good&#8221; for White Americans. Democrats being notoriously overloaded with liberals who clamor for, who espouse diversity for its own sake.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the eye-opener, Democrats. Many THINKING Americans reject wholly the absurdity of diversity. Because we&rsquo;ve witnessed first-hand the crime and social problems which are an inseparable part of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; Not to mention the staggering dollar cost of supporting the &#8220;diverse&#8221; people in perpetuity with our hard-earned tax dollars.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said for a long time; Democrats are for Feminists and Foreigners, the Republicans are for the Rich and Religious.  There&rsquo;s no place for people like me in this situation.  I mostly sit back and watch them squabble over power while both corrupt and destroy America, each in their own unique ways.</p>

		<p>Now is the prime and possibly ONLY opportunity for the GOP to be vocally pro-white and to discredit race hustlers and stop pandering to illegals and blacks as most won&rsquo;t ever vote for smaller government and banning racial preferences in the law.</p>

<p>&#8220;A choice between a party that pretends to favor whites but doesn&rsquo;t roll back any anti-white legislation and a party that actively seeks to enact new anti-white legislation really isn&rsquo;t a choice at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>There, in a nutshell, is the problem with this country.  Our government is hopelessly in the hands of an oligarchy essentially established by the 17th Amendment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not waving flags over the thought of large numbers of White Democrats joining the ranks of the Republican Party.  For starters, I&rsquo;m not a Republican (they&rsquo;re too neo-con for me).  I also realize many if not most of these &#8216;ex-Democrats&rsquo; coming into the ranks of the Republican Party will be bringing many of the loony ideas of the Left with them.  The same ideas, by the way, which utterly ruined the Democratic Party.  Call it the &#8220;Hotel California Syndrome&#8221; (after the eponymous song by The Eagles).</p>

		<p>Want my vote? End affirmative action and I will vote Democrat. At least one party will have done one thing for whitey.</p>
<p>But lets be realistic. neither party - or third party for that matter - will ever do anything to help whites qua whites.</p>

		<p>I understand the frustrations of some with the Republican Party, but the Democrats are far worse. The Democrats are sprinting at full speed towards their vision of a multicultural, socialist utopia. The Republicans have been in a casual stroll towards the same ends. This last election put the brakes on that for the time being. Although I&rsquo;d love to see a viable third party emerge, the reality is that, to have any chance at reversing this national trend (towards the multicultural, socialist utopia), it has to be done by conservatives within the GOP. If the GOP captures the senate and the White House in 2012 and fail to deliver on their promises, then I will join even the most harsh critics of the GOP (& the Democrats) and work full time with a third party. </p>

<p>Here in South Africa we&rsquo;ve been forced into Affirmative Action(in earnest) for the past 10 years. No sunset clause - in spite of an 85% black majority (and that is an increasing demographic - you know how many children they have).</p>
<p>Increased racial tension. Unemployed whites. And mistrust of blacks in upper positions - you know they didn&rsquo;t get there by ability. AA causes massive resentment with whites.</p>
<p>Our civil service is collapsing. Corruption scandal after scandal.  Armed forces&hellip;well, I think it&rsquo;s got the highest Aids rate of any group.</p>
<p>AA is really, when you get down to it, an admission that blacks cannot compete on a level playing field. </p>
<p>It amazes me that the US STILL has AA. Your social services are orders of magnitude greater than South Africa&rsquo;s. And yet you STILL prop-up (&#8216;cos that is what it is) the blacks. FHS, they are in a PARADISE compared to the rest of Africa.  What the hell is wrong with them?</p>
<p>Pity the Republican leadership don&rsquo;t have a backbone. If I was in the US, I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t vote Democrat (are whites crazy??), but wouldn&rsquo;t really want to vote Republican either. You guys really do need a third party.</p>
