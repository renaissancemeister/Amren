			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), January 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White children are set to become a &#8216;minority group&rsquo; in Birmingham, a census is expected to show.</p>
<p>A study by the University of Manchester has predicted that more than half of children in Birmingham will be from black and Asian communities when the census is carried out at the end of March.</p>
<p>In 2006, 53 per cent of children under 16 were from white families and this figure is expected to drop substantially to 47 per cent when the census is carried out in two months&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>Various public bodies have attempted to predict when the &#8216;tipping point&rsquo; will be reached which will push Birmingham&rsquo;s ethnic minorities into a clear majority.</p>
<p>Although children from white families will still make up the largest single group, youngsters from ethnic backgrounds will be in the majority which means the white children will be classed as a &#8216;minority&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Researchers from the university calculated four years ago that the proportion of children aged under 16 who are from black and ethnic minorities will rise to about 64 per cent by 2026.</p>
<p>The study suggests one reason for the reduction of white families is movement out of Birmingham to other areas of the West Midlands and the UK.</p>
<p>More than half of children in Birmingham will be from black and Asian communities, making white families a minority group, a report said today</p>
<p>Another reason is the continued immigration of people from Pakistan, African countries and China.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, the 2001 census showed that 70.4 per cent of the Birmingham population was white and 29.6 per cent were a mixture of various ethnic backgrounds, with British Asians and African-Caribbean dominating.</p>
<p>The impact of these changes in the population is already being felt in the city&rsquo;s education system.</p>
<p>The council&rsquo;s education department has warned that language difficulties among non-English speaking pupils is contributing to poor performances by some schools.</p>
<p>Last year Asian children were reported to outnumber white pupils in Birmingham primary schools for the first time, according to city authorities.</p>
<p>The figures are likely to re-ignite a debate about whether and when Birmingham will beat Leicester and Bradford to become the first majority ethnic UK city.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s great to see a debate get re-ignited about which will become the first majority ethnic city. There&rsquo;ll be many keen participants I&rsquo;m sure. We all love a good debate. The more the better. Of course, they could re-ignite a debate about why Britain is doing this to itself in the first place but somehow I don&rsquo;t think that debate will be re-ignited any time soon. </p>

		<p>Now fast forward 100 years.  England and Great Britain are no more.  The land is a checkerboard of tiny racial based kingdoms, dictatorships and several lawless areas.  Whites are pushed to the hinterlands in tiny sanctuaries.  Even Ireland became a black nation.</p>
<p>France was gone years before, broken up into several small Arab states with a few white enclaves, always under siege.  Italy and Greece were overrun with Africans.  Russia will be half the size, with Chinese immigration in the east causing a land grab by the mother country.  Sweden will be a vibrant Pakistani outpost.  and so on&hellip;</p>

		<p>We will be hearing many more stories like this throughout this century as, one by one, the English cities fall like dominoes. The sad thing is none of this had to happen. Britain was almost 100% white within living memory. The U.K. made two fatal (and to some extent inter-locking) mistakes in the twentieth century; the INSANE decision to declare war on Germany in 1914, (and again in 1939) and the even more crazy action of allowing non-Whites to come to Britain in 1948. </p>

		<p>So essentially it&rsquo;s just like the Birmingham in Alabama.  That&rsquo;s what I take from this.  While the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; in Alabama are Americans, they are causing the same effect.  While we think of Detroit as the standard for the very worst of it, Birmingham is a weird example of how long the worst can hang on or even continue to get worse!<br>

<p>How many times have we heard this, over and over? The official denials, the stoney silence, people in public meetings treated like cranks and idiots for daring to mention what everyone else already knows to be obvious? But the real question is&hellip;.are they really so out of touch and so divorced from the reality on the street? or are they quietly and secretly analyzing the situation but refusing to arouse the passions of the public?</p>

<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s debate about which city will become the UK&rsquo;s first major non-white city!</p>
<p>How about a debate as to whether importing massive numbers of destitute, fecund, non-Whites into native White lands is good for the native population?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t do that in the UK lest one find himself in prison on charges of Hate Speech and/or Inciting Ethnic Hatred.</p>
<p>Whither Britain?   Big Brother as your overlord? or the new colonial population of Pakistanis, Chinese and Africans?   </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d take Big Brother. But, it seems you have both.</p>
<p>But, don&rsquo;t despair, you&rsquo;re in good company!  We in the US are on the same suicidal path, a combination of totalitarianism and new non-White masters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say misery loves company but in this case, none of it is <i>très amusant.</i></p>

The city of Birmingham has a population of 970,000.<br>
16% are born outside the U.K.</p>
<p>67% of the city is white English compared to England&rsquo;s national average of 89%.<br>
20% are Asian and 11% within that group are from Pakistan.<br>
20% of people polled outside the city say Birmingham is unsafe.<br>
21% say it is dirty and 11% say the city is smoky. </p>
<p>Alot of media attention was focused on Birmingham by the cities media.                                                      Apparently, the aim was to guide non-whites from their homelands into England.  <br>
Any prospering country could do this even though white countries would be more appealing to non-whites.                          But why would any country want to accept these circumstances if its people would eventually relocate to decide such a drastic change was unwanted?<br>
Frankly, because the people are hynotically conditioned and propagandized.</p>

<p>Divide and conquer.</p>
<p>Most whites I know would literally rather die than even talk about what is happening. I picture this changing VERY quickly over the next ten years, when they realise that there is nowhere left to run. Whites will continue to move out of areas that are becoming &#8216;enriched&rsquo; (as they say in England), and non-whites will continue to move in, thus proving that MOST whites want to live in an all white country, otherwise Birmingham could never have the proportion of non-whites that it already has.</p>

__  __  __  __  </p>
<p>Exactly.  That&rsquo;s it in a nutshell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to compare modern modern Western Europe - Britain, France, Sweden, Netherlands   &mdash;    with the old Soviet Union as it was under Stalin, etc.</p>
<p>The Sov.U. was a police state where the people were kept in place by unmasked terror.  But the Marxists have been learning from their mistakes.</p>
<p>The more modern, efficient, more perfected strategy in the western &#8220;democacies&#8221; employs a softer approach, utilizing primarily media and entertainment to keep the populace brainwashed and  under control.  Also, they are allowed the illusion of free elections. All the while, the people are led to believe that whatever poison they are being fed is good for them.  &#8220;Diversity makes us stronger!&#8221;, they are told, while their cities crumble, their schools deteriorate, and their elderly (and young) worry for their safety.</p>
<p>Of course, Stalin didn&rsquo;t have television back then, reassuring them, distracting them,  and telling them how good everything was. That makes a huge difference. In many ways, Hollywood has become the true capital of the USA, and of the entire Western world. Hollywood has also replaced the Vatican. If Hollywood tells you something, then it must be so!</p>

__  __  __  __  </p>
<p>When you look at this from the long perspective of history, it was a transformation that happened   &mdash;   in historical terms   &mdash;   in the mere blink of an eye!&hellip; With incredible swiftness! </p>
<p>Future historians, if there are any, will look back and marvel at how amazingly quick and thorough was the conquest of Britain; how it fell like a ripe plum. The conquest of a proud and powerful country which fought two vast and heroic  world wars in the same century to PREVENT being invaded (as it feared) by a neighbor&hellip; but yet was afterward invaded from every far corner of the earth without even a whimper of resistance or a shot fired!</p>
<p>On checking London&rsquo;s demgraphics, I furthermore see that it&rsquo;s not doing much better than Birmingham.  It is listed as having a population that is only 58% &#8220;White British&#8221;, plus 2.5% &#8220;White Irish&#8221;. And that was half a decade ago.  It too is  getting very near the tipping point.  </p>
<p>As are similar cities all over Britain, and all over the continent. The next ten to twenty years are going to see some monumental changes in Europe (and inevitably in North America too).  Whether they are are met by resistance or accepted with supine passivity remains to be seen. But we do indeed &#8220;live in interesting times&#8221;.  Never before in history has the world seen anything like this!</p>

<p>England&rsquo;s #2 city, Birmingham, is now majority nonwhite. </p>
<p>America&rsquo;s #2 city, Los Angeles, has been majority nonwhite for some time. </p>
<p>Great Britain and the United States have of course a shared language; as well as much shared history. Now we also share a future   &mdash;   a future of being out-bred, out-numbered and out-maneuvered politically, within our own countries. </p>
<p>Just wait till we&rsquo;re minorities our #1 cities, London and New York, then we&rsquo;ll REALLY be in trouble. <br>

&gt;</p>
<p>As if a race to the bottom is to be celebrated, like The World Cup or Le Mans.</p>
<p>If you win the gold medal in The Special Olympics&hellip;</p>
<p>That said, there is something to be noted here in that there is no reason for whites to have -no- homeland, when every other ethny does.  Nor any reason to assume that that homeland can only be Europe.</p>
<p>We have seen the results of ethnic overrun on that benighted subcontinent before (Asian Hordes and Islamic Turks), largely because there is no natural boundary to protect it.</p>
<p>And &#8216;There but for The Hammer&hellip;&rsquo; it was not pretty.</p>
<p>But if Europe is to be lost so that these people can have a place to live in that is not a wasteland of desert or steppe, could it be not be said that the European diaspora could be America&rsquo;s gain?</p>
<p>If AA stopped tomorrow, the borders were closed to the Third World and we ceased all Legal immigration, I&rsquo;m not sure we could prevent the brown out of America.  Our TFRs and the &#8216;liberated&rsquo; women who make it possible are simply too low.</p>
<p>But, if a sudden genocidal pogrom upon the whites of Europe were to begin, in say 2018, how could we ignore their plight in the face of immigrant hordes, after having &#8216;saved&rsquo; so many Somalis and Central Americans from the kindness of their own people?</p>
<p>England has no hope through civil, legal, action.  Scotland and Eire neither, so long as they all defacto bow to the EU.  If you won&rsquo;t stoop to the levels of mass breeding and neighborhood ethnic warfare, it&rsquo;s time to start looking at changing the 1965 Hart Cellar act, creating a Euro migratory path and -forcing- rather than &#8216;waiting for&rsquo; the ethnic change that leaves Europe a an Islamic outpost.</p>
<p>If nothing else, to prove where the basis for Western Societal uplift really exists: in our peoples.  In our genes.  In our _separate_ way of life.</p>
