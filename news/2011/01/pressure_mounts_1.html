			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Beres, WKYC-TV, January 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The lack of racial diversity in Governor John Kasich&rsquo;s cabinet so far has begun to attract attention from national media.</p>
<p>Every one of the 20 full-time directors appointed by Kasich is white. There are no African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans or Native Americans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s prompted lots of criticism from African-American and other groups promoting diversity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Friday, a racially diverse group of ministers and activists met at Trinity Cathedral to talk about strategy to preserve programs from upcoming budget cuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Governor says something, nobody will have a different point of view, and if they do, they will not be comfortable saying it, so the democratic process is frustrated .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this was a mistake in judgment and it can be corrected if it&rsquo;s not racism,&#8221; said Rev. Marvin McMickle, of Antioch Baptist Church. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But minority groups say many big corporations have significant diversity on their boards. And they argue that a Governor trying to do business with the world, should have a team that looks like the world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State Senator Shirley Smith claims the governor&rsquo;s choices send a message to young people on the eve of Black History month.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we see an executive cabinet with all white people in it, it gives them nothing to aspire to,&#8221; she said.</p>

This issue came up as soon as Andrew Cuomo (D) won as governor of New York.</p>
<p>I suspect this is a new means to an end and happening in multiple states and citys; immediately after the election, start screaming that the winner doesn&rsquo;t have enough diversity.</p>
<p>Regardless of the level of diversity, blacks will complain that their numbers should be higher because of their proportions in states and urban areas.<br>

The Cleveland Plain Dealer has been very concerned about the lack of diversity in Governor Kasich&rsquo;s cabinet; all the while Cleveland is imploding.</p>

		<p>This is surprising that Kasich did this.  When he was in Congress, he was sort of a liberal on racial issues.</p>
<p>I wonder why his critics think he should have a diverse cabinet when none of the diverse voters voted for him to be Governor.</p>
<p><i>But minority groups say many big corporations have significant diversity on their boards. And they argue that a Governor trying to do business with the world, should have a team that looks like the world.</i></p>
<p>China and Japan don&rsquo;t seem to have any problem doing business with the rest of the world, even though they suffer from an acute lack of diversity in their populations, their governmental cabinets and their corporate boards of directors.</p>

		<p>Everyone here understands how race complicates everything.  White liberals and minority groups breath diversity.  It&rsquo;s what dominates their views on literally everything.  Diversity makes it impossible to have cohesion when racial animus is just below the surface.  This is why China, Japan and Korea will continue to be world economic powers while the US devolves into third world status.  </p>

<p>So all whites are the same and think the same except for a few cowards?  Non-whites have a special mojo that will allow them to fearless speak their mind?  And then the &#8216;racism&rsquo; word pops out.  How much diversity is in the governing bodies in zimbabwe, south africa or and latino nation?  Only whites ever truly diversify.  This governor was just picking from the people he knows.</p>

<p>If the world were ninety percent white, I&rsquo;m sure they wouldn&rsquo;t say that.  Anyway, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, because the vast majority of businesspeople in the world are white.  Most of the rest are Asians (Japan and China have massive economies and many of the world&rsquo;s international corporations).  Hiring a lot of blacks and Hispanics would not make doing business with the wider world easier at all.</p>

		<p>An all-white cabinet, good for John Kasich! Now, will he have the temerity to tell the diversity queens where to go? From what I have read and seen on TV, Ohio is in a world of hurt economically and needs leadership. I would think that Ohio would like to attract foreign investment and needs to stop the outflow of jobs overseas and to lower cost and less regulated states. A cabinet full of business executives who know how to make things happen sends a positive message to almost anywhere but the hood. </p>
<p>&#8220;State Senator Shirley Smith claims the governor&rsquo;s choices send a message to young people on the eve of Black History month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we see an executive cabinet with all white people in it, it gives them nothing to aspire to,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>And what does Obama in the white house give them aspirations to? This woman sounds like one of those that can&rsquo;t be pleased under any circumstances. </p>
<p><br>
BTW, here is a picture of the cabinet ministers in Chile. Even though I only speak enough Spanish to order meals and ask directions, I would take my chances under this group before the Cleveland City council. </p>

<p>I must say no thanks Rajiv and Achmed, you made it and you can keep it all to yourselves. The last thing Ohio (which is about 87% white) needs is &ldquo;significant diversity,&rdquo; to fix its problems. That is like using a gasoline pump to put out a fire, it just will not work.  </p>

		<p>Well, we can see first hand how well blacks have run cities like Detroit, Gary, Newark, Baltimore and Cleveland. Ohio is in real economic difficulty. Kasich better put the best people he can find in his cabinet and their primary focus should be restoring Ohio&rsquo;s economy. In other words lower taxes, lower regulations and curtailing frivolous law suites. Let capitalism flourish. It works every time. Rev. Marvin McMickle is playing the usual racial hustle that community activist types have been using for decades. Elected officials should never be surprised by these efforts and should always be rhetorically prepared to vigorously defend their appointments against these claims. </p>

		<p>So black critics of Kasich point out that all corporate boards now have blacks aboard.  Kasich&rsquo;s proper response should be that today&rsquo;s CEOs are spineless wimps who are terrified of bad publicity   &mdash;   and that he&rsquo;s not that type.  </p>
<p>Gov. Kasich bears a strong resemblence to Harrison Ford.  Let&rsquo;s hope he&rsquo;s Indiana Jones in real time.  His appointments show he&rsquo;s off to a good start.</p>

		<p>Cheers to John Kasich appointing the people whom he thinks will help him govern Ohio, effectively.</p>
<p>I have news for Ohio State Senator Shirley Smith. Kasich&rsquo;s first duty is to the citizens of Ohio, not to the world community. He should be more concerned with Ohio&rsquo;s economy, not obtaining a sweetheart deal with some Third-World enclave.</p>
<p>If Smith is so concerned about Bantu role models for Bantu children, let her point to Cleveland&rsquo;s Bantu mayor, the Browns and Bengals, and the Cavaliers, as well as Ohio&rsquo;s MLB teams.</p>
<p>Besides, what difference does it make. Who in the state of Ohio can name the governor&rsquo;s cabinet members anyway? Who even knows the departments that make up the governor&rsquo;s cabinet? </p>
<p>Imagine this &#8220;person in the street&#8221; interview with a newscaster, and an inner-city denizen of Cleveland:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is John Scott of WCLE news. I&rsquo;m interviewing a Cleveland resident on his opinion&rsquo;s of Governor Kasich&rsquo;s cabinet. Sir, what is your name.</p>
<p>The interviewee answers, &#8220;Tarquinius Cleavers Kasavubu&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me the governor&rsquo;s head of the department of health?&#8221; </p>
<p>Kasavubu answers, &#8220;The badroom. That&rsquo;s where the medicine cabinet be&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Political is about winning and losing. You can&rsquo;t organize as a group and vote as a group, and when you lose expect the benefits to come your way anyway.</p>
<p>You can win when you win and win when you lose too, but only in your own mind. I assume there are some non-white conservatives in Ohio. Maybe the governor&rsquo;s opponents can ask why some of these people are not in his cabinet. Bu they cannot ask why they are not. They lost.</p>
