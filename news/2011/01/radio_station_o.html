			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, January 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A local school board member and radio station owner under fire for airing an inflammatory editorial denouncing Martin Luther King Day has had his concealed carry permit revoked after he threatened a rival radio station owner to a &#8220;shootout.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brett Reese, who has been airing an editorial four times daily on his station KELS-FM denouncing slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. as a degenerate embezzler, a &#8220;plastic god&#8221; and &#8220;an America-hating communist,&#8221; is also facing retribution from the school board on which he serves.</p>
<p>The Mountain States Anti-Defamation League has asked Reese to stop broadcasting the editorial, which contains statements that appear verbatim on a website with links to a white supremacist group.</p>
<p>The Denver Post reported Sunday that Reese&rsquo;s concealed carry permit was revoked by the Weld County sheriff and he was served with a restraining order after he threatened a rival radio station owner with a &#8220;shootout&#8221; if the station&rsquo;s ad sales team didn&rsquo;t stop calling businesses that underwrite Reese&rsquo;s non-commercial station.</p>
<p>Reese reportedly said he was receiving threats for airing the editorial and wanted to carry his gun to school board meetings for protection. {snip}<br>
&#8220;Timed as they are, Mr. Reese&rsquo;s words demean the existence of the Martin Luther King Holiday and its honoring of not just Reverend King but of his messages of equal rights, peaceful demonstration, civility and respect,&#8221; the board said in its resolution.</p>
<p>Reese is unapologetic about his anti-Martin Luther King Jr. ads.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 40-year-old former carpenter claims he helped build houses for Habitat for Humanity in the Mississippi Delta and once dated an African American woman. He insists he&rsquo;s not racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reese said some advertisers have departed the low-power FM station, which he has owned since 2000, over the editorial. But he said he is financially able to survive indefinitely without sponsors. He said he&rsquo;s received death threats.</p>
<p>He also said that he&rsquo;s not trying to become a lightning rod for debate over the holiday, which was controversial in some states at its inception. &#8220;That&rsquo;s not what my push is. I think it&rsquo;s important for people to discuss any issue openly, freely and without being assassinated or bankrupted.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an elected member of the Greeley-Evans School District 6 board since 2009. The Greeley Tribune began writing about the radio editorial earlier this month.</p>
<p>Reese had aired the editorial, which he said was sent to the station in an anonymous letter, in relative obscurity for the past three Januarys.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reese said a message he left at the rival station about &#8220;having a shootout&#8221; over sponsors was misinterpreted and that he&rsquo;d stop carrying a gun to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Whoops!! He was thinking with his microphone and not his sidearm. I have found that carrying a gun is a good way to learn to keep your mouth shut. Who wants to challenge a jugglehead over cutting in line or something as trivial?  Also, It is a crime to display the license itself  in a manner  designed to brag or intimidate. Sounds like this is what he was in violation of after a fashion&hellip;</p>

<p>Oh, God, will these anguished cries of &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a racist!&#8221; <i>never</i> end?  Okay, so this guy isn&rsquo;t backtracking  &mdash;  which is good.  But at the same time, he flaunts the standard being-a-racist-is-like-being-a-leper mantra.  As if only by flashing his simon-pure non-racist credentials does he have the right to criticize the Black Saint.</p>
<p>When a White man actually has the guts to laugh publicly at accusations of &#8220;racism,&#8221; will somebody please wake me up?</p>

		<p>If I were Brett Reese, I would file a lawsuit against the radio station that is sabotaging his livelihood. I would also file suit against the Weld County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office for revoking his CCW permit. He has been receiving threats and yet the county sheriff&rsquo;s office is leaving him with no way to defend himself? If anything happened to him I would view the sheriff&rsquo;s office as an accessory to murder.</p>
<p>In this country we as white people know our freedoms, especially our freedom of speech, is being greatly impinged. Black and hispanic people can say whatever, and we cannot. Even though I feel some courts of law are stacked against us, we still need to fight them. This is our only recourse to do it. MLK was not the god they make him out to be. And if somebody wants to point out that he wasn&rsquo;t much of a man, he should have the freedom to do so. No matter what his race.</p>
<p>Since when did blacks get their own set of freedom of speech rules? They DID NOT. And if it were me, Mr. Reese, I would continue to carry my gun. It sure sounds like the Weld Co. S.O. could care less about your safety. We all know cops can&rsquo;t protect us. They&rsquo;ll tell you so themselves. They&rsquo;re only good for cleaning up AFTER a crime has been committed. Stay safe, Mr. Reese. God bless you.</p>

<p>Notice how Reese&rsquo;s words were taken out of context with plenty of scare quotes, while the school board condemnation was printed in its entirety. One of the many tricks the MSM uses to show which opinions are acceptable and which are not.</p>
<p>Also, notice how Reese is accused of linking to a &#8220;white supremacist group,&#8221; but the NAACP is never referred to by the MSM as a &#8220;black supremacist group,&#8221; which it is.</p>

If Brett Reese was denied his concealed carry permit because of his anti-King editorials I would be concerned. In this case it seems that he made a credible threat to engage in violence. </p>

		<p> First, if you carry a concealed weapon it is not a matter of discussion. Wether or not a citizen chooses to carry is a personal matter for them alone, and at no time should their exercise of their 2nd Amendment rights be a tool of argument or intimidation - if this is the case here then he is wrong.<br>
 Second, and most least - There is no truth to the MLK image that all the apologetic whites bow to in their efforts to cleanse their conscience. Martin King was a opportunistic race-baiter who took every advantage he could find. He wanted only to &#8220;make whitey pay&#8221; for what he saw as injustice, never mind the lies &amp; crimes along the way.<br>
 MLK is a fictional image of a champion of the oppressed which utilizes Martin&rsquo;s likeness for the continuation of the pc demoralization of ethnic whites.</p>

		<p>He was baited&hellip;pure and simple. He should have been smarter. But he was really nothing more than just another member of the media. Not our friend&hellip;now or ever. These degenerates use the First Amendment as a weapon everyday for a living. They use it against us&hellip;they use it against themselves.</p>
<p>Sponsors pay them tons of money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re rich&hellip;we&rsquo;re poor. The cops work for them&hellip;yes, the same cops who enforce protection money laws for car insurance companies. How many Geico commercials do you hear on the radio everyday? Speaking of radio&hellip;wait, we already were.</p>
<p>Please, teach your children that they are NOT our friends and that they DO NOT represent us.</p>

		<p>I remember MLK when making demands, would frequently warn that he couldn&rsquo;t predict what might happen should his demands not be met; a thinly veiled threat if there ever was one.<br>
It reminded me of the Black Hand tactic of telling a businessman that he might have an accident or a fire if he didn&rsquo;t pay the tribute.</p>

<p>That is not even close to being in line with what our founding fathers meant for our right to bear arms.  They specifically intended for our government to fear us.  Free speech was created specifically as the right to dissent.  Weapons were intended specifically as our last line of defense against tyranny.</p>
<p>As Benjamin Franklin so eloquently put it&hellip;.democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.  Liberty is a WELL ARMED lamb contesting the vote.</p>
<p>That is literally the right to argument and intimidation backed up with armed violence as a necessity for moral freedom.</p>
<p>The way you put it assumes that such is wrong.  That&rsquo;s part of the brain washing inherit in the soft tyranny of liberal neo-communism.  You can have your gun but it&rsquo;s evil to fight back.  That&rsquo;s the liberal view.  But the conservative view is little better.  You can have your gun and protect yourself if someone else targets you first, but its evil to use it as power for any other thing.  A heck of alot of tyranny has resulted from that line of thinking.</p>
<p>The truth is, we have guns.  Guns are power.  Power is to be used&hellip;..used wisely.  Having power and using it, ensures we keep power.  Only that and nothing else.  It isn&rsquo;t given to us but taken by us.  And it will be taken from us if we no longer have a will to use it.</p>
<p>Liberals and our government should quake in their boots thinking about the armed, racially aware, &#8220;red neck&#8221;&hellip;..with good reason.</p>
<p>If that ever stops, the real slavery will begin&hellip;.the type where YOUR morning begins with the crack of the whip against your back.</p>

<p>Yeah, because the term &#8220;shootout&#8221; is NEVER used metaphorically.  Try googling the word &#8220;shootout&#8221; and see how many hits you get which are not about gun-battles.</p>

<p>Glad to see I&rsquo;m not the only one here that listens to RFN. Mr. Covington aired a beautiful podcast defending Jared Taylor  immediately after the Arizona shooting. In it he admitted that he doesn&rsquo;t think Mr. Taylor or AmRen goes far enough, but at least he trying to get something going up here. (I already live in WA state.) More people need to hear his message of freedom and survival for White children and the continued existence of our race. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t they have any insight into how irrelevant and pathetic that sounds. But let me add that I&rsquo;ve got a friend who doesn&rsquo;t think it is irrelevant or pathetic. </p>
