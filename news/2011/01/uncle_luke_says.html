<h1>Uncle Luke Says Oprah Has &#8216;Come To Her Senses&rsquo; in Hip-Hop Battle</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nolan Strong, AllHipHop, January 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rapper/mogul Luther &#8220;Uncle Luke&#8221; Campbell recently gave props to media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who recently launched her new cable TV channel, OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network).</p>
<p>Uncle Luke was pleased with the launch of OWN, because after years of criticizing Hip-Hop,Oprah was forced to acknowledge the power of the genre with the debut of the series Master Class, which featured superstar entertainer, Jay-Z.</p>
<p>&#8220;By debuting with Jay-Z, she is acknowledging she needs rappers to generate interest and revenue for her new media venture. I&rsquo;m happy to see that after spending so many years bashing rap music, Oprah has come to her senses,&#8221; Uncle Luke told the Miami New Times.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When he was finally accepted to appear with the other cast members, Oprah took aim at the rapper and then allegedly edited out his responses, prompting Luda to speak out.</p>
<p>As a result, rappers like Ice Cube and 50 Cent public condemned Oprah, who eventually capitulated to the pressure and ended up featuring Jay-Z on the Oprah Winfrey Show in late 2009.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hip-Hop has become such a global force, that even Oprah Winfrey must submit to the power and influence of the genre.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s realized she can&rsquo;t have a network that appeals to just vanilla audiences,&#8221; Uncle Luke explained. {snip}<br/>

		<p>I am so glad that the Oprah show is off the air as it was.  To have audiences of white women, gushing in adoration and worship for what amounts to a non-stop gossipping woman of questionable education, was sickening.</p>

		<p>For those unfamiliar with the moral pillar that is Uncle Luke, he is responsible for such chesnuts as &#8220;Me So Horny&#8221; and &#8220;F  &mdash;  - Shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oprah does not &#8220;need&#8221; hip-hop anymore than Martha Stewart needs rap music to maintain her media stranglehold. Oprah&rsquo;s base is comprised mostly of an army overweight white women who blindly follow her orders in terms of what to read, eat, and when to cry.</p>

		<p>I could never stand to see the glazed eye, mouth open look on the faces of the white audience members. They look so star struck, as though in the presence of greatness. I&rsquo;ve always wondered what was wrong with these people, were they cult followers or what? I always found her show to be somewhat tawdry and voyeuristic, not something I would describe as an asset to the culture.    </p>

		<p>Aaaah, the woman that helped bring us&hellip;. Barack Obama!!!!</p>
<p>Did you know that she, too, was a member of Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s anti-white church?  Oh, yes.  What does that tell you about the &#8220;real&#8221; Oprah?  She withdrew several years earlier right after Obama&rsquo;s speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2008.  I guess she knew Jeremiah would be getting the spotlight pretty soon because that speech catapulted Obama into the stratosphere and created talk about him being president!!!</p>
<p>I started to despise Oprah a long time ago.  Each year it got worse and worse as I&rsquo;d watch groveling white women drool over every word Oprah spoke.  She would have racism as the topic on her show and, as usual, the vast majority was committed by, you guessed it, whites.  The only emotion she brought out in me was nausea.</p>
<p>Eventually she will retire.  I just can&rsquo;t wait!<br/>

<p>You&rsquo;ll get no argument from me there.</p>
<p>Only thing is, she now has <b>her very own channel</b> where she has hours and hours of programming, stupid feel-good reunion/behind the scene shows, idiots like Dr. Phil, odious, stupid stuff that I cannot get off my cable line-up     &mdash;   AND it replaced Discovery Health!  </p>
<p>Where am I supposed to watch Dr. G now?</p>

		<p>I remember as a boy seeing those intricate super-gross drawings on the walls of all bathroom stalls.  Art it was not, but it sure got my attention as some repulsive stuff.</p>

		<p>Please pardon me, while I puke.</p>
<p>Rap music is an oxymoron. No ifs, ands, or buts.<br/>
It is an insult to Western Music, to White Men, and to America.</p>
<p>Like the ancient Greek legend of the Sirens who drove men mad by their music, I stuff my ears whenever I hear this sonic affront. </p>
<p>It is worse than mere noise, it is VULGARITY given aural incarnation.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t even glimpsed the Oprah show for about 20 years, so know little about the audience or anything else concerning it.  However, I have to wonder, after reading these revelations, if she has decided that her network will have to appeal to a largely black audience.  There won&rsquo;t be too many matronly white women listening to hip-hop.</p>

If you want to see the true disconnect between Oprah and her white female audience, look no further than Oprah&rsquo;s endorsement of Jay-Z. Feminists have denounced white men for far less but they never seem to take rappers to task. </p>
<p>Jay-Z has a song, &#8216;99 Problems (But a B***h Ain&rsquo;t One)&rsquo;. I would post the lyrics but they wouldn&rsquo;t make it through the filter.</p>

		<p>To underdog (re post # 10):</p>
<p>Winfrey sold almost all of her Chicago holdings, except for Harpo Studios. I&rsquo;m surprised she&rsquo;s living in Vermont. I was under the impression that she was moving to Los Angeles. Since Vermont has around a 1% black percentage in the state, Winfrey will stick out like a lump of coal in an Arctic snowfield.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I don&rsquo;t think her OWN is going to go over big with white women. If all that network will have is rappers, they&rsquo;ll tire of it rather quickly. Winfrey will soon discover that she&rsquo;ll need to have sex-scandal themes on her show, same as it was in the beginning; if she expects to keep her audience.</p>

		<p>Her little pad in S.B. is over 60,000 s.f. now she is only here part of the time yet she has the audacity to tell you in your 1000 castle to only use one sheet of toilet tissue.<br/>
I don&rsquo;t fault her for what she has (she has earned it) but I think as many of her kind are, she is a hypocrite in what she tells you to do and what she THE FAUX QUEEN does. </p>

		<p>Quite recently Oprah spent a few days out here in Oz. Up till then she had been someone that I had vaguely associated with afternoon TV (soapies etc)</p>
<p>Her visit here was an absolute sensation, she met anyone who was anyone, visited an amazing amount of Australia in such a short time and received a rockstar welcome wherever she went!</p>
<p>But listening to her I was mildly embarrased and had to think to myself, what, really, is this lady all about?</p>
<p>I can certainly believe that she helped catapult BHO in to the White House.</p>
