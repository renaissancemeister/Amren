<h1>Minneapolis Officer Accused of Assaulting His Wife</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Star-Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), January 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Minneapolis police officer was charged with felony assault Friday, accused of hitting his wife in the face with a gun and threatening to kill her.</p>
<p>Mukhtar Abdulkadir, 36, of Andover was quarreling with his wife Wednesday before bedtime, according a criminal complaint filed in Anoka County District Court. The next morning, he threw her on the couch and punched her in the ribs, the complaint said. As she was screaming, he put a pillow over her head, according to the document.</p>
<p>With his 3-year-old child yelling at him to stop, Abdulkadir grabbed a handgun from a closet and hit his wife in the face with the butt end, the charges said. She didn&rsquo;t seek medical treatment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Abdulkadir was charged with felony second-degree assault, terroristic threats and domestic assault. The Minneapolis Police Department&rsquo;s internal affairs unit is investigating.</p>

		<p>Back when American criminals in the heartland were mainly white, detectives could go undercover in the communities with ease.</p>
<p>Now that there is a cornocopia of global diversity in the criminal world, police forces are required to have numerous ethnicities and language specialists on staff.</p>
<p>This has led to panicked hiring of people who probably wouldn&rsquo;t have passed selection.  Somalis are particularly difficult, because they are all linked by clan and religious loyalties, and the community is heavily involved in fraud and major crimes.</p>
<p>A Somali&rsquo;s loyalties are to Allah, the Koran, his clan, and not much else. </p>

		<p>Always remember, you can trust a cop when you are in trouble.  Just look at that honest, compassionate face.  I&rsquo;d go to him for help after a mugging, wouldn&rsquo;t you?<br>
More likely, he&rsquo;d be the mugger.  Diversity.  Stinks like what your dog leaves behind on the neighbor&rsquo;s lawn.</p>

<p>Yes, they&rsquo;re investigating, and if a preponderance of the evidence points to his guilt he could very well be given a reprimand, afterwhich an apology will be issued to the NAACP and CAIR.</p>
<p>All I can say is that if his attitude is anything like his mug shot portrays he should be back in the slammer in no time.</p>

		<p>This situation concerns only women, Muslims, liberals, immigration promoters and Blacks. Since I belong to none of these groups, it does not concern me.</p>

<p>Regular AR readers get used to seeing mugshot after mugshot like this, in these daily reports of minority crime. But they&rsquo;re not usually mugshots of Police Officers. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Somalis are particularly difficult, because they are all linked by clan and religious loyalties, and the community is heavily involved in fraud and major crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also VERY violence prone folks and adept at same. British internal security MI5 recognizes a great danger from the Somali living in Britain, 10 % of those Somali men can field strip and AK blindfolded in less than a minute!</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it. These are very dangerous people and provoking them even in a trivial way is fraught with great danger.</p>
<p>Am I prejudiced to say that?</p>

		<p>I lived in Minneapolis and had an interesting conversation with a  an American black guy. His complaint about Somalis was funny to listen to: he said he and his wife ( who is white) went to a near downtown bar, well-known for many years. He said he felt really uncomfortable because there were all these Somalis in the place&hellip;&#8221;just wasn&rsquo;t the same&hellip;&#8221;<br>
I felt like saying &#8220;yeah white guys know all about that feeling&hellip;&#8221;<br>
Then he said the Somalis were really weird; that they and their girlfriends were always getting hammered on the hardstuff and then the girlfriends would get hammered by the guys. He said the Somali men just beat the hell out of their women all the time. <br>
Lesson: you can take the Somali out of the hellhole but you can&rsquo;t take the hellhole out of the Somali. It is always waiting to strike. </p>
