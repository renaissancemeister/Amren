<h1>The Future of the Navy Lies in Diversity</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luke Visconti, DiversityInc, January 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Anthony Winns joined the U.S. Navy at a time when diversity was not a strategic imperative for the organization. He was once the only Black officer at Naval Air Station Barbers Point. But times in the Navy have changed dramatically, and Winns has been part of the transformation. Through hard work and insistence on competence and accountability from those in his charge, he&rsquo;s risen through the ranks to become a vice admiral, earning several honors including the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, and Navy Commendation. He became Naval Inspector General in 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He recently sat down with DiversityInc CEO Luke Visconti, who is a former Navy helicopter pilot, for an interview. Here are key excerpts:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Visconti: </b>You see a lot of differences in the Navy. There is extreme diversity in the Navy from the top to the bottom now, unlike when you and I were junior officers.  </p>
<p><b>Winns: </b>I was the only African-American officer on the entire base at Naval Air Station Barbers Point back in 1980. It was two years before we got our next Black officer on the base.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Visconti: </b>You were confronted by people who said that diversity in the Navy was really just lowering quality. I think there is a human reaction that says &#8220;If you win, I lose.&#8221; If you get these women in, then I might not get that spot, that promotion. Some woman might take it or some African American, whoever it happens to be. How do you manage despite those reactions?</p>
<p><b>Winns: </b>There is a natural human tendency to resist change. One must recognize it, know it exists and then deal with it.</p>
<p>Diversity is a strategic imperative for the United States Navy. We defend the greatest nation in the world. Our country is founded on democratic principles and the promise of opportunity for all. We, in this country, have changing demographics. By 2020, a third of the workforce will be comprised of &#8220;minorities,&#8221; and by 2042, the minority will be the majority. So, given the changing demographics, if an organization like the United States Navy wants to be relevant and wants to tap the most talented and the best and brightest  &mdash;  who are our most precious resources  &mdash;  then you have to go where the talent is.</p>
<p>Diversity is critical to mission accomplishment. We&rsquo;ve got to access, mentor and retain the best talent available. New ideas and diversity of thought are vital to getting your goals accomplished in any organization, and it&rsquo;s no different in the United States Navy.<br>

		<p>Basically, it is diversity that will be the cause of the next military calamity to occur, if the US ever goes up against a force other than the rag tag bands they&rsquo;ve encountered so far.</p>
<p>There are more ills in the military now than ever before, with a Pentagon that has been molded into a leftist image by the likes of Carter and Clinton into a nest of the politically correct mess it is now.</p>
<p>Political correctness has no place in the military, just as it had no place in the sub-prime fiasco.  And history will note that the practice of it brought this empire down both financially and militarily.<br>

		<p>He&rsquo;s sounds like a prodigy black that is a black who as an above 100 IQ with no real expectation of having things given to him. He is well aware of the trend in demography and the services like to extole these realities in order to make it seem only natural that we allow women and minorities in the service and give them plub positions. </p>
<p>This guy is the exception I did 3 years in the Navy from 74-77 and I can tell you the women are dishonest and the blacks are lazy. That is they cause more problems than they solve. This guy was chosen because he doesn&rsquo;t tipify the attitudes of most blacks or other minorities. Whites who are high class have mostly given up on the service. </p>
<p>Back before WWII every one was in the service the Kennedys, Bushes most of these folks were well off and understood that service to your country is expected and a debt that needed to be paid for being an American citizen.</p>
<p> What the volunteer service has created is a sense that citizens of this country owe their country nothing. This has allowed the government to put in too many Asians, Pakistanis, Mexicans and other minorities. The military is sort of a job that white men of substance don&rsquo;t want to do. </p>
<p>We should go back to the draft. This would force whites to have some service and would give them a greater understanding of how the other half lives. </p>

		<p>&#8220;then you have to go where the talent is&#8221;<br>
If the majority of nonwhites in the navy were talented, the Navy wouldn&rsquo;t have to go out of its way to recruit and promote nonwhites. It could simply recruit and promote the most competent people. But perhaps I&rsquo;m misunderstanding the meaning of &#8220;talent&#8221;, mired as I am in white male-speak. I guess that in diversity lingo, &#8220;talent&#8221; means &#8220;not a white male&#8221;.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the Navy&rsquo;s gone downhill.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So, given the changing demographics, if an organization like the United States Navy wants to be relevant and wants to tap the most talented and the best and brightest &mdash; who are our most precious resources &mdash; then you have to go where the talent is.&#8221;  And what if where the talent is happens to be the white population?  And what evidence is there that the non-white population is such a reservoir of talent?  And what about motivation? I don&rsquo;t believe that the war we have been engaged in for almost nine years now - where the Armed Forces originally  had large &#8220;minority&#8221; membership, has proven that non-whites are the most talented or bravest or most motivated.  Quite the opposite.  Not coincidental that most combat troops and almost all special forces are white.</p>

		<p>Yes, diversity is so important to the Navy, that it makes you wonder how we ever won a Naval battle before we embraced it.  It also invokes thoughts of trepidation, that there were once backward and primitive times when the Navy didn&rsquo;t even see the strength in diversity.  Yet, for something that&rsquo;s so uber-important, this article doesn&rsquo;t bother explaining why or how diversity is so important or such a strength.</p>

<p>Yes, and who might those people be?  Throughout history, and even today, have Africans and AmerIndians ever excelled as sailors or developed and used sophisticated Navies?  Is there any evidence at all that Africans and Indians (=Mexicans) have a talent for sailing or building and maintaining navies?</p>
<p>If &#8220;the best and brightest&#8221; are &#8220;our most precious resources,&#8221;  then we better start paying attention to those kids with exceptionally  high-IQ&rsquo;s (as opposed to directing most educational funding toward the bottom 50% of students (a group that almost never makes technological or scientific advances).</p>

		<p>The Kitty Hawk incident. Almost forty years ago now. Blacks rampaged through the ship as a group, beating white sailors nearly to death. Instigated as part of planned insurrection in my opinion, mimicking almost exactly what is seen when viewing the communist movie &#8220;Potemkin&#8221;!</p>
<p>Also possibly compromised nuclear weapons aboard the vessel. This is not clear, NO ONE WILL EVER SPEAK ABOUT IT.</p>
<p>Zumwalt when asked if this was a mutiny, he deferred to his legal staff. The head of the whole navy could not even answer if this was a mutiny or not [IT WAS!].</p>

<p>Everything I&rsquo;ve learned about our military forces over the past couple of years will probably create a serious moral dilemma for me if China ever gets a reason to use its new super-duper missiles on our our fleet. Who should I root for, the racially inhomogeneous military force that bases promotions on intelligence, aptitude and loyalty to their nation, or the guys that will be so busy giggling and tying on clothes or watching rap videos that they probably won&rsquo;t even notice that they are under attack?     </p>

<p>The truth about diversity in the Navy is that it weakens<br>
the Navy.<br>
The majority of sailors share the mess decks and go on liberty with sailors of their own race and gender.<br>
In the lower ranks, some sailors form cliques to demonstrate that they are better capable of maintaining a watch so they can get promoted faster.<br>
Other sailors form gangs and try to own their own shipmates including their division chief in order to do what they want to do and decide when they get promoted and if they should.<br>
If a closeted homosexual is accepted by a gang then they will let him or her pursue a straight sailor for sex.<br>
If that sailor resists control than that sailor will be targeted for a beatdown or lose promotion.<br>
In the upper enlisted ranks chief petty officers do their own thing.<br>
They may work a division of sailors to exhaustion for no reason other than for kicks or set a sailor up for a beatdown or discharge with promises of promotion to the sailor who does the deed.<br>
Ofcourse, most of the Navy isnt like this and this is just an example of what can happen if a ship loses integrity.<br>
The higher your rank and the more unusual your rating, the better your chances of success.<br>
I believe that Washington will use its power to flood the Navy with diversity and achieve success unless the American people speak out.</p>

		<p>I retired after 22 years of honorable naval service.  Almost without exception, I have never met a black man in the Navy that was worth it.  At least in the submarine service.  This is not my opinion as much as it is a simple objective observation.  My first experience with black sailors was during my first day in boot camp in Orlando Florida.  We all had to pass a swim test in the pool.  The swim test required that you had to jump off the diving board located on the deep end of the pool and swim to the far side of the pool using any swim stroke that you wanted.  Every single black guy that jumped into the water could not swim and started to drown.  The instructors had to go in and get them out of the pool.  All of these black guys had to stay behind and join a special company so that they could pass the swim test.  That was my first experience with &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  What a bunch of crap.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If I consider the Naval Academy, not only could I get a quality academic education, I could get a well-rounded education because I would be mingling with students from all over the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uh, &#8220;mingling with students from all over the world&#8221;? At the U.S. Naval Academy?</p>
<p>Boy, I am so out of touch with what is going on!</p>
<p>Also, this guy is a bagful of clichés. Yes, a person can learn a bit from &#8220;mingling with students from all over the world&#8221; (though not nearly as much as one can learn from visiting other peoples in their native habitats), but to my mind that&rsquo;s hardly the main ingredient in a &#8220;well-rounded education.&#8221; </p>
<p>Notice also the not-so-subtle confusion of issues (diversity vs. diversity of thought) achieved by his statement,</p>
<p>&#8220;New ideas and diversity of thought are vital to getting your goals accomplished in any organization&#8221;</p>
<p>Whew. If we went green and started burning for fuel all the bullpoo lying around, our energy problems would be solved.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m most disturbed by his statement that the Naval Academy has students from all over the world. I don&rsquo;t understand that at all. I know, for example, that many Latin American officers have received training at various U.S. military schools, but I hadn&rsquo;t imagined foreign students being admitted to the three service academies.</p>

Most (not all) of the blacks are so lazy you wouldn&rsquo;t know they were in the navy, except for their unsatisfactorily maintained uniforms.  Its OK for blacks to dress however they want when going ashore, but whites must adhere to the regulations, for example:  black guys can wear a size 85 FUBU shirt and pants around their knees and that stupid rag on their head, but I cant leave the ship until I put a belt on although my clothes fit properly.

		<p>Read the history of the all black, with white officers, 24th Inf Rgmt in the early days of the Korean War to see what could await the United States military if this nonsense were to become fact.  The unofficial ballad of the 24th Inf Rgmt was &#8220;The Bugout Boogie&#8221; and started with the words, &#8220;When the mortars begin to thud the Duece Four begins to bug.&#8221;  Finally, wiser heads at 8th Army broke up the 24th Rgmt and assigned it&rsquo;s soldiers in small groups to formally all-white Infantry Divisions.  Serving in Vietnam in the late 1960s &amp; early 1970s at large installations was as dangerous as fighting the enemy as the blacks were always involved in rioting and disobeying orders from their officers.  Long Binh Jail (LBJ) was heavily populated by their kind.  Poster #6 is correct that currently our Special Forces, Rangers, and Infantry are mostly white but for how long?</p>

		<p>Odd, they never mention the time when at least a third of the navy was Black. That was in the age of sail, and ships are more complex now a day. I have no problem with minorities as long as they pass all the tests with no special bonuses for being a non-white male. </p>

		<p>Quote from the official report:- &#8220;1. The subcommittee is of the position that the riot on Kitty Hawk consisted of unprovoked assaults by a very few men, most of whom were below-average mental capacity, most of whom had been aboard for less than one year, and all of whom were black. This group, as a whole, acted as &#8220;thugs&#8221; which raises doubt as to whether they should ever have been accepted into military service in the first place.&#8221;<br>
I have personally witnessed the disgusting, lewd, loudmouthed and undisciplined mob behaviour of American navy blacks during their shore leave in places as diverse as Hong Kong, Singapore and Bahrain. They are held in total contempt by the local citizens wherever they go who simply cannot understand why they are in the US navy as they must be a liability at all times. I, as an Englishman, have then to explain about &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; etc in all walks of American life. They ask me why the British Navy doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the same problem even though rating do get drunk and fight with crew from other Royal Navy ships. I don&rsquo;t have an answer except that our navy applies minimum standards during recruitment, whatever the colour.  </p>

		<p>What these people are doing is indulging in wishful thinking. They want to see more faces like themselves, so they are trying to convince everyone that this is a wonderful idea and that it will work.</p>
<p>But will it?  Has it ever?  Was there ever a successful racially mixed navy in history?  Or a company, or country, or organization?  (Yes, I know the Dutch picked up an occasional black or Indonesian here and there for use as sea hands, and the British,&hellip; but were they officers? Were they admirals? Did they have a Diversity policy and Affirmative Action discriminating against Dutchmen?)</p>
<p>This is really a first in history, and what they are doing is experimenting with our country, our future. It is a high-stakes gamble, wagering the USA as collateral for their unproven  multi-culti  social experiment.  When you have a good thing going, why try to &#8220;fix&#8221; it?  For two centuries, America has had a good thing going. What was wrong with the military that made us number one in the world?  The Chinese must be grinning!  Our many enemies around the world, who are salivating for a chunk of America,  don&rsquo;t have to do anything but just wait. Driven by our zeal for racial equality and &#8220;social justice&#8221;, we will destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>And, furthermore, when this happens, will anyone be so clear-sighted, so honest, as to admit the truth? Or will they be hurling excuses and blame at every conceivable reason, except the real one?  After the inevitable naval disaster, will Admiral Winns be explaining to Congress that we didn&rsquo;t have ENOUGH diversity?</p>

<p>Winns: There is a natural human tendency to resist change. One must recognize it, know it exists and then deal with it.</p>
<p><br>
Please answer the question that&rsquo;s being asked, and leave the nebulous philosophizing about &#8220;Change&#8221; and &#8220;Human Tendencies&#8221; to the shrinks and the gurus. The question being asked is, isn&rsquo;t diversity a zero-sum game? Isn&rsquo;t it true that &ldquo;If you win, I lose&rdquo;? Isn&rsquo;t it true that &#8220;If you get these women [or other minorities] in, then I might not get that spot&#8221;?</p>
<p>I believe the correct answer to those questions is Yes, it IS  a zero-sum game, because the number of positions to be filled is finite, not infinite. I suspect Winns knows that&rsquo;s the answer too   &mdash;   which is why he had to change the subject. </p>

		<p>When was the last time the Navy fought a real battle?  </p>
<p>They now run around the world with their huge behemoth targets (A.K.A. floating brothels) called aircraft carriers very well prepared to fend off the Japanese sailing for the US west coast.  </p>
<p>I suspect a modern Japan would be a bit more ingenuous then go back to obsolete ships, however. Witness the launch of a Chinese submarine missile off California a few months back.  </p>
<p>The Army has always had trouble with blacks and that was the reason for segregated units.  Truman integrated the Army, not because he loved diversity, but because black units performed so poorly in Korea.  He figured that scattering Colored Troops throughout white units would spread the &#8220;incompetence&#8221; to a manageable level. </p>
<p>Jeddermann, mentioned <i>The Kitty Hawk incident</i> where blacks mutinied.  But the Army had its own problems during that time especially in Germany.  Blacks routinely rampaged through barracks beating and sometimes killing whites. </p>
<p>The son of a family friend of my mine died after being thrown from a third story barracks window by blacks while <i>serving</i> in Germany in the early 70s. Of course the Army brass lied and CYAed the incident.  </p>
<p>During that time it was acknowledged (sarcastically, but with some truth) that the Soviets could have walked through West German almost without firing a shot.  We had no effective Army there.  </p>
<p>Recruiting for diversity has no bounds.  El Navy is not the only branch of the government pushing this game. DHS, CBP a few years ago had a big hiring where minorities were preferred (they still are).  Now this  corrupt organization is reaping the benefits of its stupidity.  </p>
<p>According to Dave Gibson in examiner.com, 17 Jan 2011; <i>In 2010, CBP conducted well over 750 corruption investigations [of officers].</i> This is not surprising, but I wonder how many more, especially in high grade levels, have escaped the net.  </p>
<p>Most of those investigated had Hispanic names. You can check this out by developing an informant(s) within DHS, Customs. </p>
<p>As a final thought I often wonder how many lost at sea sailors each year are really gang hits.  It would seem so easy to &#8220;disappear&#8221; a troublesome white boy or girl over the lifeline during the mid-watch. </p>

		<p>Anonymous 37 - Good point.  The Army was integrated because of the poor performance of black regiments in Korea, specifically the all-black 24th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Infantry ID.  Known as the &#8220;Bug-out Deuce-four,&#8221; the 24th Regiment became the centerpiece for congressional investigations, which (naturally) found that &#8220;racial discrimination&#8221; was the reason for the 24th&rsquo;s disgraceful performance.  The Army subsequently broke up all-black units and integrated them into white line units.</p>
<p>While the performance of individual blacks was often highly satisfactory, most were a burden to their comrades in future conflicts, most particularly in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Interestingly, with the all-volunteer Army of today, combat units have become virtually all white or Hispanic, as blacks have sought support roles, thus reverting largely to the roles they occupied before the Korean War experiment. </p>

<p>I find your post very interesting, hitting on things I have long thought about.  What do you think of;</p>
<p>1. The damage done to morale due to the cessation of separate services for men and women (i.e. WAVES and WACS), integration of women into the same military schools, West Point, units, ships, offices, etc.?  Wasn&rsquo;t this the beginning of the trend that has seen prostitution on ship, in barracks, along with rapes, both violent and institutional?</p>
<p>@.  Life on subs is hard enough.  Discipline must be strict since they are often on six month stretches of duty.  Could it be that adding women to the mix a calculated move to increase the pressure on the male contingent in the Navy so that the female officer class can acquire more power through the lawsuits and disciplinary actions that will result from the inevitable outbursts so foreseeable in a crowded condition like a submarine?</p>
<p>3.  What do you think of the latest debate over the announcement that women will be used in front line fighting in platoons that patrol difficult terrain on missions that last days and weeks?</p>
<p>On #3 I have these thoughts; perhaps it is high time to call Feminists on their bluff and the overwrought mythology that has been creating in the West regarding women as equal in everything (or better) as in suitability as fighters, combatants.  Perhaps enduring the reality check female Airborne Rangers and Green Beret, CIA, Mountain Units, etc., would provide would finally settle this question. </p>
<p>I have always thought that forcing men, who still represent 99.9% of the suffering and dying in our forces, to salute a &#8220;superior&#8221; female officer is in itself a drag on morale that can produce bad male behavior eventually.  The emasculating nature of our armed forces, except for the special forces units that so far have been able to exist on their own, with a minimal of Feminist/Marxist equality doctrines to bully them is why we still have effective ground forces.  It is important to note that these units are mostly made up of whites from rural locations, and our casualty lists are majority white males.  Don&rsquo;t you think that playing with social engineering to this point is dangerous?  And don&rsquo;t you think that it proves that white men are still carrying the brunt of American and free world sacrifice with almost zero recognition, and dismantling that could cause the collapse of the U.S. military?</p>

<p>Having written this mouthful, how do you square the fact that the Marines recruit women?  I know that boot camp for females is separate and females are held to lesser standards than males.  How does this affect your statement about low recruiting standards, because in my view, it was ridiculous to start recruiting females into the Marines.  Forcing a Marine to salute a female &#8220;superior&#8221; who is held up to lower standards (as everywhere else) has to be morale sapping, even if they won&rsquo;t admit it.  I know that I was glad I was too old when these armed forces trends began.  It would have been like my sisters and mother bossing me around day in and day out with the occasional non relative to tempt me into misbehavior.</p>

I had two buds aboard the Kitty Hawk during this incident, one a Naval Aviator another, a Marine pilot.  This was a mutiny, one that almost endangered the ship.  Both of my friends were in the same ROTC class with me. I called it quits after my time owed, my marine friend a few years later, and the Navy friend retired last year.  We all determined that our children would not enter mil service due to the trends that we have seen.  It is worse than you all know.  </p>
<p>Perhaps you may recall an attack on US army personnel that tried to chop down a small tree in the ROK DMZ.  NK regulars crossed the MDL in force and fought with a smaller number US/ROK personnel that were there to trim the trees.  A NK offficer got ahold of an ax and murdered two US personnel.  Things looked like WWIII was impending.  A female major, US, was scared out of her mind as her unit was located north of Seoul.  She jumped in a jeep and sped south as quickly as possible.  She was never court martialed for desertion.  This is but one of thousands of stories that any serviceman can relate to you.  Point is America, be afraid, very afraid.  China knows what is happening, that we are traveling down the same road as the Roman Empire and that when we fall many millions will die.  I am concerned that we are within perhaps 50 years or less of this.  </p>

It also promotes an atmosphere where ridiculous and utterly absurd ideas must be accepted on an equal basis. In this atmosphere good ideas and truly original thought is condemned to failure.

		<p>#42 Whiteplight, you bring up some very valid, interesting points, which I totally agree with. The resentment and power struggle between men and women brought about by the new and future plans for women in the military can only be detrimental. I can only imagine men required to be subservient to power hungry women in positions of superiority, particularly pre-menstrual women every month who are screaming at them one minute and bursting into tears the next while dealing with cramps and chocolate cravings. Won&rsquo;t that be fun? And so productive.</p>
<p>The secret snickering at, and accusations of the female soldier/seaman/airman - or whatever the PC term for them is -  of being either gay or sex-starved or both, alongside natural male tendencies and desires can do nothing but create terrible morale and a large number of tribunals, lawsuits and discharges. Call me a dinosaur, but the clerical end of the military is fine. It&rsquo;s just that I feel there are just some places women don&rsquo;t belong.</p>

		<p>The only parts of the armed forces that white men should support are those engaged in the direct defense of the continental U.S., the nuclear forces or the Coast Guard and perhaps the Navy.   If you really want to put the fear of God into the establishment, particularly the Republican/Conservative establishment,  start advocating a white boycott of combat ground forces.  No more dying for you until we get closed borders, until the entire carnival of white-hating genocidal racism stops.  Why fight and die for a regime that hates your guts, and spits in your face everyday while telling you it can&rsquo;t wait until you&rsquo;re wiped off the face of the Earth.  Here is one of my favorite quotes, from Tiberius Gracchus - though written more than 2,200 years ago it is seemingly aimed at us today:</p>
<p>&#8220;The beasts of the field and the birds of the air have their holes and their hiding places; but the men who fight and die for Italy enjoy only the light and the air. Our generals urge their soldiers to fight for the graves and shrines of their ancestors. The appeal is idle and false. You cannot point to a paternal altar. You have no ancestral tomb. You fight and die to give wealth and luxury to others. You are called the masters of the world, but there is not a foot of ground that you can call your own.&#8221;  </p>
<p>As whites become a minority it is inevitable that &#8220;diversity&#8221; is indeed the future of the military, and the more diverse it is the quicker it will drive whites out of the military and the more PC and ineffective it will become.  Maybe taking the military away from Free Republic types who mindlessly support the dog-wagging tactics of corrupt Republicans like George W. Bush isn&rsquo;t a bad thing.</p>

<p>Those branches are STILL mostly all White and are the only really functional and FMC units in the &#8220;modern, diverse&#8221; military. I too, personally witnessed a mutiny by blacks in VietNam when they had taken over one of the few two story wooden barracks at base and had white &#8220;hostages&#8221; and threatening to murder them if their demands were not met. I told the commander, a Col. that he should set the building on fire and kill all of them as they ran out (I assumed he would know to kill only the blacks) my patrol and I concluded our business on that camp and left to finish our business in the far jungles and never did learn the results of that fiasco but I can guess that nothing hapened to the blacks.</p>

		<p>I find this story rather interesting, if unsurprising.  Back when I was interested in joining the Navy I witnessed a mestizo woman failing the short version of the ASVAB(scoring under 30 points) only to be told by one of the black recruiting officers to go and study a &#8216;cheat sheet&rsquo; online(he gave her the URL there) and then come back and retake it.  </p>
<p>This is a test I scored over 90 on after being out of high school for several years working low end jobs and generally not stimulating my brain at all, and without studying for a single moment.  I&rsquo;m convinced the average white middle schooler could have passed it with flying colors.  Throughout the recruiting process I only met a single person who scored higher than me, which was a white woman who had studied for months before taking the test.</p>

		<p>Hey Whiteplight:  I think in some ways you are off the mark.  I never said anything about sending women into combat.  I find it utterly ridicolous to send women into combat unless they ABSOLUTELY meet the same standards as the men!  I believe that the Canadian army, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, allows women into combat MOS&rsquo;es only if they meet the same standards as the men. So far, to the best of my knowledge, only two women in the Canadian army have met that standard.  Incidentally, though I&rsquo;m a female veteran and proud of it, as a joint-services person, in the late  1980&rsquo;s and 1990&rsquo;s I saw the feminisation of the military, and did not like it.  Before you go on disparaging all women who served in the military, no I wasn&rsquo;t in a direct combat role- that is NOT what women Marines do! Women do have a place in the military, but only in support roles, and certainly don&rsquo;t need to be in combat roles.  I saw the &#8220;female card&#8221; playing sometimes too, not so much in the Corps, but in other services I was around.  On a personal level, though being a male in the military would of course been more advantageous, I had to play the cards I was dealt with.  I&rsquo;m second-generation American, and before joining, saw communism up close and personal in the glorious former Peoples&rsquo; Democratic Republic of East Germany, where some of my relatives had to live before the collapse of communism.  No, I&rsquo;m not terribly sympathetic to the Germans in light of what they did in the Second World War, but communism was, and is an extremely evil system.  Back then, when this country was a better country than it is then, I felt as a American citizen I had to do something.  Finally, are you slightly bothered by the fact that you never went?  As before, I too absolutely despise the feminisation of the military, along with the &#8220;diversity&#8221; nonsence and now homosexuals being allowed to serve.  As my  now-deceased  East German grandmother would have said, the idiots who have pushed all of this garbage down our throats, &#8220;are residing in Cloud-Cuckoo Land.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;The Royal Navy had a black admiral in the 18th century. He was recruited in Jamaca as an ordinary seaman and worked his way up to flag rank. &hellip;He had to be exceptional to achieve this. I am too tired to go downstairs to look up his name.&#8221; <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I can believe you; no need to look it up. [There were several Russian generals like that&hellip;well, at least one or two.] The point being that he was the great, great exception.  He made it entirely on his own (but I&rsquo;ll bet he had sympathetic mentors). There was no official affirmative action program in place to give him, and all of his kind, an artificial boost at others&rsquo; expense. Nor would it have been tolerated.</p>
<p>Nor, I am sure, would a large number of his kind have been welcomed into the &#8220;British&#8221; navy. It was his utter uniqueness that made him acceptable, if not a delightful novelty and a curiousity. It was probably an attention-getting advantage that helped him, whereas a white in his position would have gotten no attention at all. As long as he remained a great rarity, it worked in his favor.<br>

<p>Ironic, Mike. Since &#8216;one-man, one -vote&rsquo; arrived in SA in 1994, we&rsquo;ve seen a steady decline in South Africa, as it becomes a black-(mis)ruled country. And the decline has increased in the past two years.</p>
<p>In &#8216;99 the (black majority) goverment signed orders for advanced weaponry (The infamous Arms Deal - which is STILL being investigated - we now KNOW there were massive kickbacks to the ANC &#8216;elite&rsquo; and to the ANC itself - which is supposedly communist/socialist, Ha, ha.)  </p>
<p>So : a squadron  of Griffen fighters, 4 corvettes&hellip;and wait for it&hellip;4 new state-of-the art diesel subs. No matter a developing (devolving now in my opinion) country like SA didn&rsquo;t need advanced stuff like this -but money (under the table) talks. And subs????  And questions were asked even then, as to who would man these technically advanced machines.</p>
<p>Guess what&hellip;the subs, after having been sailed here from Germany, have sat rusting in Simon&rsquo;s Town naval base ever since - haven&rsquo;t even completed sea trials on our coast. In fact, two of them are now damaged through incompetence. (Bashed into quay and batteries mis-charged from quayside (remember, diesel subs rely on massive, expensive, batteries))  And the navy is almost completely black - as is the rest of the armed forces now. Whites were literally forced from the Defense Force - and now -Would you want to serve in a majority black service, knowing you&rsquo;d be passed over for promotion? Or even TRUST an affirmative with making good decisions? The head of the Navy is now some black &#8216;admiral&rsquo;, politically appointed, with no sea time. Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s a woman!!! Oooh,doesn&rsquo;t that just give you the warm fuzzies&hellip;.</p>
<p>Apparently,according to a Question in Parliament asked by the opposition DA, the black sailors are unhappy about taking them for sea trials. That is,  there aren&rsquo;t enough qualified submariners. MMMM. See, we HAD submariners (white)&hellip;who obviously resigned, knowing full well there would be little/no chance of fair promotion - and almost certainly not wanting to serve under incompetent, speedily promoted blacks. Affirmative Action in all its glory. &#8216;Leveling the playing fields&rsquo; Huh!!  (I think the Griffens are having ground maintainance problems too - lack of aircraft technicians)</p>
<p>Fact is - blacks are not sailors, no matter how they want to delude themselves.</p>

<p>How true that is!  With nonwhites filling the ranks and homosexuals, we can assume this is all DELIBERATE. They only have use for Whites to do the combat roles and to die off first. This is also DELIBERATE!. We have lost hundreds of thousands of good White men due to the wars our enemy gets us into and we would now have many offspring from those same White men and our population numbers would not be as low as they are now. Just think of the Civil War as one example. 500,000 White men from both sides gone forever and all their future generations that would now be.</p>

		<p>I went into the Air Force in 1981 for one hitch. In our basic training barracks they posted everybody&rsquo;s ASFAB test results( don&rsquo;t know if they do it now). All (really all) of the blacks had almost zero mechanical and electrical scores. The only place they scored well was in Admin and other. Other means either bus driver or cook etc. </p>
<p>  One of the training tools in basic is to make recruits fold their clothes, underwear etc for inspection. They even give you a manual showing you how to do it. The majority of the blacks totally botched this task and their clothes looked like a total mess during inspection. My mother made me fold my own clothes since I was 6 years-old so it was a cake walk for me. Many blacks that couldn&rsquo;t overcome the bad inspections came to me and proclaimed  &ldquo;what does folding underwear have to do with learning my trade&rdquo;  <br>
I told them &ldquo;If you cant learn to fold underwear, how will you learn to repair and maintain  a KC-135 TANKER?&rdquo;<br>

		<p>Seems to me if the navy started to look for qualified people for their job offerings and forget diversity, we would fair much better. I spent 9 years in the navy from 1954 to 1963,during which time we had a large quantity of different nationalities, but only one primary goal. We operated as a team, we were not looking for diversity,but, competence in doing assigned jobs. I believe united we stand and divided we fall has good meaning to those who are not tied up in believing in diversity rules. At the time I served, you had set standards for advancement that everyone had to meet.  Those people that concentrate on pushing diversity for diversty sake are doing a disservice to everyone involved.</p>

Agree. (in the ARMY) I got in trouble for saying Mam to black female lieutenant. I told her she was an Office-MAM and not an Office-SIR. But it is not any different from having to take orders from any incompetent minority Officer or NCO. I had a black E-5 in my unit who made his rank in 5 year. That is the quickest you can attain E-5 rank. He had an ASVAB score of 65. There wasn&rsquo;t a day that went by that he didn&rsquo;t screw something up. He would navigate us into a mock minefield or into a river. He called in a mock artillery strike into downtown Columbus Georgia. We had a few white guys who maxed out the ASVAB score (140??). I scored 124. You would not believe what it was like to take orders from a complete idiot. One of the white guys made a fake suicide attempt to get out. He was our Equal Opportunity NCO and he HATED whites. He blamed whites every time he made a mistake. The black guy was real tough when he had back-up, but when we got orders to deploy to Saudi Arabia, he tried everything to get out of going. Luckily I was moved to a different platoon. I only knew of 2 good black NCOs while I was in the Amry. I can only imagine what it is like today.</p>
