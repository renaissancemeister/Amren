<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Appearing on MSNBC, Monday, to promote his new special on Barack Obama, Chris Matthews attacked &#8220;older white people&#8221; for still holding bigoted feelings against the first African American President.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A transcript of the exchange, which occurred at 11:44am EST, follows:</p>
<p><b>CHRIS MATTHEWS: </b>Well, it&rsquo;s two years and tonight we&rsquo;re honoring that as well as the Martin Luther King Day and it&rsquo;s sort of an interesting overlay, the two of them. The first African-American president, no matter what we say, it&rsquo;s non-ethnic, non-racial about the President, I think that&rsquo;s appropriate 90 percent of the time, it is historically important and it will be marked I think by a lot of people in history books that he is the first African-American president and how well he did. {snip}<br>
<b>JANSING: </b>Let me play a clip from tonight&rsquo;s program. Then we&rsquo;ll talk a little more.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>UNIDENTIFIED: </b>After the election, I think because some of the hard slogging and the politics, he [Obama] didn&rsquo;t become that inspirational personality. Ronald Reagan in his first two years, he had more unemployment, he didn&rsquo;t have a financial crisis, but Reagan was able to keep up that inspiration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>MATTHEWS: </b>Did you see the age difference there?</p>
<p><b>JANSING: </b>What would you say it is?</p>
<p><b>MATTHEWS: </b>It means  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s significant. I think older Americans, older white people still have a problem with this guy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>MATTHEWS: </b>And I think that&rsquo;s a generalization and I&rsquo;ll stick with it. I think younger people do not see race as an obstacle. I don&rsquo;t think  &mdash;  I think, they&rsquo;re much more non-judgmental. In fact, about ethnicity, they just say that&rsquo;s not relevant  &mdash;  In fact, they say it&rsquo;s irrelevant and don&rsquo;t even notice it, whereas older people notice it all the time.</p>

		<p>Chris Matthews said after an Obama speech last January   &#8220;he made me forget he&rsquo;s a black man for an hour&#8221;. </p>
<p>Is that an example of &#8220;not noticing&#8221; Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; ethnicity&#8221;? Nope.</p>
<p>Chris Matthews is 65 years old,  from a lily white background. Comments like this prove he doesn&rsquo;t realize he&rsquo;s one of those &#8220;older white people&#8221; he likes to smear. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, he usually ends up looking like a clown.  </p>

I don&rsquo;t make a point to watch Mr. Matthews but even catching 5 minutes of air time is certain to make you wonder about his politics and beliefs, especially about white people.</p>
<p>Mr. Matthews is obsessed with President Obama. Has anyone forgotten the &#8216;tingle&rsquo; that ran up his leg when he thought about candidate Obama?</p>
<p>Like Tim Wise and Frank Rich and all the others, these people are salivating over the prospect that whites may soon be extinct in America.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s remarkable is that they seem to believe America will better off when whites are gone; that only then will America reach her full potential. Scary stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just like a character out of Camp of the Saints.</p>

		<p>Older white Americans can remember what the country used to look like.  They remember low crime, low unemployment and high standard of living. They remember when talking back to the teacher was shocking behavior. They remember uni-culturalism and liked it that way.  Basically they remember the country before it was slowly eroded into whatever it is today.  Obama is just a symbol of the decay.  </p>

		<p>MSNBC is the Obama Station.  Chris Matthews, Keith Olbermann, and Rachel Maddow all have exactly the same political point of view   &mdash;   they&rsquo;d be right at home in a university&rsquo;s &#8220;Whiteness Studies&#8221; class.  The MSNBC troika always insists that any criticism of Obama is racism.  (But strangely, their own fierce criticism of Bush was not anti-white racism.)  I don&rsquo;t like any president who favors illegal immigration, anti-white discrimination, massive deficits and growth of the government, and doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind if America stays mired in a war forever.  That means I don&rsquo;t like any of the presidents we&rsquo;ve had in a long time, black or white.<br>

		<p>Chris Mathews asked us &#8220;white bigots&#8221; awhile back to give us our honest appraisal of Obama if he were white.  My answer to that is that we don&rsquo;t need to imagine   &mdash;   change Obama to white and you&rsquo;ve got every other Democrat President since WWII and a good percentage overlay of most of the Republican Presidents since WWII.  So he didn&rsquo;t win me with that question.</p>
<p>Notice that Comcast just bought NBC from GE.  All the low ratings dead weight hosts over on MSNBC are sweating their entire anatomy off, because Comcast isn&rsquo;t going to treat MSNBC as a leftist propaganda-spewing loss leader like GE did, because GE and its tool CEO, Jeffrey Immelt (any relation to Jeffrey Imm?), wanted to butter Obama up in order to get a boatload of Federal money from both ARRA (&#8220;Stimulus&#8221;) and TARP (GE&rsquo;s financial arm bought a few rinky dink banks in Utah in order to qualify as a &#8220;bank&#8221; in order to get TARP money.) </p>
<p>The new owners have no such worries.</p>

		<p>Matthews has a problem with older white people does he? Everyone has a problem with someone. I have a problem with him! His loud-mouthed, abrasive, inaccurate, biased (against whites) reporting makes me so mad&hellip; that I don&rsquo;t watch him! That seems to be the case with a lot of other people. Let&rsquo;s see how long he lasts once Comcast (a real media company that lives and dies by ratings, unlike present owner GE) takes over. Not long I bet. Bye Chris!</p>

		<p> Younger White people feel that they&rsquo;re &#8220;not supposed&#8221; to notice race because that&rsquo;s the way they&rsquo;ve been brainwashed in school. I&rsquo;ve even had a couple try to tell me that they &#8220;don&rsquo;t notice&#8221; race. But I say that&rsquo;s a load of hooey. It&rsquo;s not &#8220;politically correct&#8221; right now to acknowledge race   &mdash;   unless it&rsquo;s to accuse some White person of &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how older Americans are smeared for being &#8220;racist?&#8221; But aren&rsquo;t older Americans the very ones who went along with all this &#8220;civil rights,&#8221; affirmative action, social engineering and racial displacement of whites we&rsquo;ve had over the past 40+ years? If that&rsquo;s being &#8220;racist,&#8221; then God help us!</p>
<p>And as far as these younger Americans being so &#8220;non-racist,&#8221; why is it when it comes to choosing a neighborhood in which to raise a family, younger whites are just as likely to choose a white neighborhood as older whites? More propaganda from the left, an attempt to make it seem like racially conscious whites are a dying breed.</p>
<p>Indeed, as social conditions continue to worsen in this country, the cities continue to crumble and the rot continues to spread to the suburbs, it will actually be <i>harder</i> for younger Americans not to become racially aware, as all of the magical social engineering programs of the past half-century  will have been shown to be dismal failures.</p>

<p>So countless &#8216;idealistic&rsquo; young white kids worked day and night for years for Obama and tearfully celebrated his victory, while at the same time they pretty much didn&rsquo;t &#8220;even notice&#8221; he was black?</p>
<p>With his amazingly clear and logical speaking abilities, Chris Matthews makes Joe Biden sound like Cicero. <br>

Matthews is playing to his audience. Guess since he&rsquo;s an older white guy he can smear older white guys. He&rsquo;s just an idiot and I don&rsquo;t even pay attention to him. </p>
<p>MSNBC is a far left new group that has zero credibility and almost zero audience. </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t understand why Mathews is still on television. It takes all of about 10 minutes to realize he&rsquo;s an idiot. He never shuts up - it&rsquo;s like there is an always-on direct connection from his brain to his tongue with no moderating dial.</p>
<p>I think he like to hear himself talk and at the same time he thinks what he says is important or insightful - it&rsquo;s basically jibberish.</p>
<p>He also is totally obsessed with race. It&rsquo;s crazy to hear him spout off so much on a subject he thinks should not even exist.</p>
<p>Playing armchair psychologist, I think he knows full well that blacks are genetically deficient in all major areas - IQ, rational thought, impulse control, and so on - and have not only ruined his home region in and around Philadelphia but much of wherever they live in America. </p>
<p>But for some reason he simply cannot bring himself to face the simple truths so he grossly over-compensates and has become a black apologist. </p>
<p>Of all the pundits he comes across, IMO, as the most detached from reality. He&rsquo;s either a shameless huckster and self-promoter or is mentally disturbed. I suspect both.</p>

		<p>I remember reading Chris Matthews&rsquo; book where he explains how he avoided the draft during the Viet Nam War by joining the Peace Corps.  I thnk he said something like, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not sure I was afraid of being shot or what.&#8221;  I think the real reason is that he being the elitist that he is, just didn&rsquo;t want to be around other American men his age that weren&rsquo;t from his class.  It is very evident that he continues to think that way, that the most of us &#8216;Joe the Plumber types&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t really in his league and their opinions about politics just don&rsquo;t count.  He never passes up a chance to denigrate the White male whenever he can, he constantly blasts the Tea Party members as as imbeciles.  Maybe if he could do his show in blackface he&rsquo;d be happier.  These insults towards the older White population in this country shouldn&rsquo;t go unchallanged.  Maybe he thinks there are too many White people left in the USA to his and the rest of his Leftist friends liking.  Most of the world during WWII didn&rsquo;t think there were too many White men landing on the beaches on D-Day or in the Pacific theatre.  Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong but some psychologist ought to analyze that &#8216;tingle&rsquo; Chris feels whenever he sees or hears President Obama giving a speech.</p>

		<p>With few exceptions most of the young white people I know are far more &#8216;racist&rsquo; than the older generations.  Then again, I&rsquo;m dirt poor and so are the people around me - none of us have the benefit of living in a 100% white community away from blacks and mestizos, we have to deal with them on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Rather ironically I myself was quite the non-racist until my family moved and I was sent to a school with more than a handful of blacks in it.  Talk about an eye opener.  </p>

<p>I hate to break it to you, but race is just as significant to youth as it is to older generations, it is just that we have been taught to act as if it does not matter. I am very young, not even 20 and race is very significant to me and a great deal of the young people I know.<br>
These sorts of statements are the equivalent of plugging your ears, closing your eyes, and yelling loudly.<br>

		<p>Kitty #5 referred to the psych term for ascribing one&rsquo;s feelings to another.  It&rsquo;s called transference, and I&rsquo;ve often thought Matthews was swimming in it.  He protesteth way too much over every indication of racial, ethnic, religious, or cultural awareness in America  &mdash;  proving only that he, as a white Catholic male boomer from PA, is at least as aware as any other American of these very qualities.  <br>
If he feels as strongly as he contends, he should quit and insist that he be replaced by a teenage black Moslem female from Atlanta.</p>

		<p>Until the &#8220;progressives&#8221; get their way, the old media has to compete with the new media. Most psychologically normal people can differentiate reality from fantasy when given the choice, especially when observable reality stands in stark opposition to PC fantasy. In pitching their anti-white agenda, the MSM is a one-trick pony. All they can do is ramp up the frequency and amplitude of their propaganda. The corporate media is on the ropes, their &#8220;Plan B&#8221; is to &#8220;regulate&#8221; the new media. Good luck.   </p>

		<p>Anyone who says young people don&rsquo;t think about race hasn&rsquo;t spent time at a university in awhile, where their professors and grad student teachers are obsessed with the sins of whiteness. Some might come in espousing color blind beliefs, but by the time they&rsquo;re done they leave either hating their whiteness or adopting &#8220;racist&#8221; attitudes because they&rsquo;re so tired of hearing about their evil evil whiteness.</p>

		<p>My experiences growing up, attending college and later in the working world have only increasingly turned me against non-whites and the whites who suck up to them too. Thanks to being demonized for both my racial and ethnic heritage, I despise many non-whites, especially the ones who swallow the lies about us. I am a Slav, and I had relatives who can tell you what it is like to live in dread of the infamous knock on the door at two a.m. I resent the slavery millarky I hear all the time, these blacks here ought to try living as a slave under the yoke of Jewish Bolsheveki, Mongols or Muslim Ottoman Turks who pillaged and raped Ukraine and Russia time and time again. That was real slavery, with a generous helping of murder and destruction mixed in. Nor are they aware that Muslims attacked every European nation for centuries for the purpose of slave raids. They stupidly think whites have never been enslaved, but their ignorance knows no bounds. I have been the target of threats, violence and harassment repeatedly, and every time but two where I was about to use or have used force against someone it was a non-white provoking me. The older I get, the less I trust and the more I want to be away from those not like me. I don&rsquo;t even like being around most local whites either, because many still think all of Russian and Ukrainian descent are Communists, a slander against me and everyone else like me.</p>

<p>When Michelle Malkin called him a Neanderthal she was right on the money.<br>
I wonder if the tingling is still going up his leg. </p>
<p>Older Whites were around to see the rapid degradation of their neighborhoods and finally their cities and have identified the cause. The younger generation is the product of years of polyanna &#8220;diversity&#8221; indoctrination and anti-Caucasian revisionist history. Its consciousness of &#8220;ethnicity&#8221; is limited to self loathing. <br>

		<p>It is (sadly) a very common myth that just because someone is &#8216;young&rsquo; that they will be more: hip, with-it, tolerant, intelligent, energetic and &#8216;progressive&rsquo; in all things.</p>
<p>The people who are propelling this myth forward are the socialist/marxist-minded, even if they don&rsquo;t know that this is the sum total of their beliefs.  They assume that just because they themselves are all youthful and &#8216;vigorous&rsquo; and full of social justice, that ALL young people everywhere are.</p>
<p>They imagine the fantasy that when the old geezers die off that a new &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; and multicultural world based on harmony and social justice will result. (Think: John Lennon and his Imagine song.) They push this vision everywhere, especially in schools at all levels.  Even when some of them get &#8216;old&rsquo; themselves, they still act like they&rsquo;re 22 years old and are always out protesting and marching &#8216;with the oppressed masses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The trouble is that a number of assumptions are taken for granted.  First of all, they assume that young people will naturally flock together regardless of race or cultural background.  A look at any lunch room in a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; school anywhere in the world disproves this.</p>
<p>Even the young and liberal generally only socialize with others who look like them, with a very few exceptions.  (For example, the token asian or black friend.)  Dating patterns reveal that most races stay together, even when young people have ample opportunity to mix.  </p>
<p>A few interracial pairings here and there, and some of them are based on true love so I don&rsquo;t mind that, do not a trend make.  The much vaunted black male/white female pairing owes more to black boys pushing themselves on weak-willed white girls with no daddies than anything else.</p>
<p>What these &#8216;young&rsquo; people are failing to realize, due to their inexperience and lack of wisdom, is that when the protective shell that surrounds them with money, opportunity and a gazillion other unseen benefits, is broken by the &#8216;social justice&rsquo; movement, that these poor white saps will have no jobs, no safety, no opportunity and no justice.</p>
<p>These same whites go to blacks, latinos and now even asians and tell them over and over that whitey is oppressing you and that you are justified in attacking him.  When the power of whitey is no more, do you think those other races will play kumbaya with us?  Look at Zimbabwe or South Africa.  </p>
<p>Older whites know this is a possibility for their grandchildren.  Younger whites are not sober-minded enough to even consider it.  They&rsquo;re too busy enjoying the tail-end of a civilization all those &#8216;dead white men&rsquo; created.</p>

		<p>#17: MikeH  &#8220;With few exceptions most of the young white people I know are far more &lsquo;racist&rsquo; than the older generations&#8221;</p>
<p>Mike, it&rsquo;s like that here in SA as well. My parents grew up in the apartheid times and really had very little interaction with blacks(apart from household help)  - and the country was generally well run. Whites my age (40) and younger are MUCH more anti-black than our parents. As you said, it&rsquo;s the dealing with them on a daily basis that does it. NOT ignorance, but frustrating, bitter,  experience.</p>
<p>Why? With the repeal of the apartheid laws in 1992 (which were really about separate development rather than repression, no matter how the MSM in the west portrayed it - and remember, the black anti-apartheid groups were violently communist), we&rsquo;ve seen how the majority black goverment (the  still communist - aligned ANC) is progressively wrecking this once-great country with endemic corruption and&hellip;yes you guessed it&hellip;an obsession with race. Affirmative action is compelled. (For God&rsquo;s sake it&rsquo;s been 20 years since &#8216;Freedom&rsquo;) Policing is absolutely pathetic - most whites were encouraged to leave - or saw they would be unfairly treated with promotions etc, and decided to leave. The government services are now almost completely black - and badly run. Helllishly expensive submarines were bought in &#8216;02 (I still can&rsquo;t figure out the need), and float listlessly on quay, never having been used at sea! The Aids-ridden Army is almost 100% black, and totally useless now. One corruption scandal after another-and few prosecutions. The more one has to interact with blacks the more one realises how useless the average black is. That&rsquo;s not bigotry, but coming from experience, regretfully. </p>
<p>In 1992, I was 19 and voted in the referendum to repeal apartheid. Like most whites, I voted for the repeal as we thought it was the right thing to do.  God how I regret that now. I was brought up in a liberal household - but my day-to-day interaction with blacks since has opened my eyes.</p>
<p>I/we can actually SEE SA inexorably sliding  down to becoming yet another African pool. Zimbabwe is already there - and the ANC is big chums with its de facto dictator, Robert Mugabe.</p>

		<p>I would say less transferrence or projection than psyops 101: &#8216;cultural disenfranchisement&rsquo;.  Make something look so bad or so good that the demonization/loss psychology causes depression and loyalty reversal in the affected population.  </p>
<p>Something the CIA has done for decades to build up or tear down dictators.</p>
<p>In the third world.</p>
<p>In this, it&rsquo;s obvious the democrats are looking to pull in every guilted out voter they can.  By making old white folks seem out of touch with &#8216;modern youth&rsquo; as their cultural replacements (and dependent FICA tax source), the idea is to get a few more elderly white percentage pointers to &#8216;vote for the inevitable&rsquo; as a function of -displacement- of power from themselves to a vested followon ethnic culture they &#8216;hope&rsquo; will continue to care for them.</p>
<p>That is SPECIFICALLY why you have an old white Hyde lecturing to an audience of would be old white Jekels.</p>
<p>It really is nothing less than that.  And it is proof #1 that these people are -terrified- that their &#8216;vision&rsquo; is drowning in an apathy towards &#8216;change&rsquo;.  As bankruptcy, both fiscal and cultural.</p>
<p>Hang in their old white wisdom, we need your conservatancy.  And we want you to talk some hard truths to your kids.  Build the bridge, don&rsquo;t burn it.</p>

		<p>As a White person born in the 40&rsquo;s I thank God everyday that we did not have any blacks in our schools or in our small town. We would not have been such a quiet, safe and NORMAL town if we were flooded with blacks, even back then. </p>
<p> What few mexicans we had they were nothing like the mexicans of today and Whites outnumbered them 10 to one. Today in that same small town the mexicans outnumber the Whites ten to one. I hate even driving through that town now to go to the cemetery as it looks &#8220;mexican&#8221; now. The &#8220;downtown&#8221; area and most neighborhoods are barrio looking. What a shame that we allowed this to happen to OUR America. White America is long gone. </p>

<p>You mean you HOPE they don&rsquo;t.  I doubt they will be as bad as GE was, but it&rsquo;s not a cut and dried assessment that they will be much further toward the middle as we would like.</p>
<p>Olbermann is out, Drudge says so today.  But is that an indication of things to come or has he become too arrogant to deal with?  Or a publicity stunt like last time in order to get free advertising for their last place network?</p>
<p>Schultz and Maddow are just as bad, so let&rsquo;s see if they are asked to stay on.  If they still have shows at the time Comcast re-arrangers start moving things around a bit, then it&rsquo;s going to be about the same.</p>

		<p>People in their twenties through 40&rsquo;s tend to buy more, go more places, and are obviously more active politically, so it&rsquo;s understandable they would be a targeted audience for the networks.</p>
<p>And speaking of &#8220;more active,&#8221; if there are changes going to be made for the better in this country it will be by those in the younger age groups, especially the 20&rsquo;s/30&rsquo;s group.</p>
<p>If you notice from the TV coverage of the protests in Europe, it&rsquo;s mostly all younger people, and it&rsquo;s been reported it was the youth who effected the changes taking place right now.  It went from a peaceful tourist destination one day to what some are calling a revolution the next.  It was rapid.</p>
<p>We could also use some younger people on this forum to put some life into the WN movement.  Sorry, but we&rsquo;re getting to be a bit stodgy, displaying a lack of fire in the belly.</p>

<p>I hate to break it to you, but race is just as significant to youth as it is to older generations, it is just that we have been taught to act as if it does not matter. I am very young, not even 20 and race is very significant to me and a great deal of the young people I know.</p>
<p>These sorts of statements are the equivalent of plugging your ears, closing your eyes, and yelling loudly.</p>
<p>And as far as these younger Americans being so &ldquo;non-racist,&rdquo; why is it when it comes to choosing a neighborhood in which to raise a family, younger whites are just as likely to choose a white neighborhood as older whites? More propaganda from the left, an attempt to make it seem like racially conscious whites are a dying breed.</p>
<p><br>
Actually, I would like to believe this was due to race, but in many cases, I would argue that class is the definitive factor. I used to be an adjunct faculty member at a small liberal arts college from 2002-2009. During his time, I saw a number of interracial couples. I also saw a notable amount of interracial interaction among people of various races.  The vast majority of students, (including the minority ones) came from middle class or higher economic backgrounds. </p>
<p>Perhaps this had something to do with the environment of the campus. </p>

<p>While this is somewhat true, (yet debatable), this does not mean that these young people are racially conscious. Students (and adutls in general) tend to gravitate toward others with similar interests and other common traits whether they be athletic, academic, musical, literary etc&hellip; </p>
<p>There was a post on this website a few weeks ago about an experiment that took place at a predominately White high school in New Hampshire. According to the article, students discomfort with others who they did not share similar interests with was apparent. </p>
<p>Given the fact that this school was located in New Hampshire, it is possible that the school was all White.</p>
<p>In short, race is often a secondary or non-factor in their decision.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I think younger people do not see race as an obstacle. I don&rsquo;t think &mdash; I think, they&rsquo;re much more non-judgmental.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if they do believe it, it&rsquo;s just fashion, fashion enforced with the greatest propaganda campaign in history &hellip; and more than a little muscle.  But their superstitions won&rsquo;t alter the reality of the third-worlding of America.   Also, what things like &#8220;young people don&rsquo;t see race&#8221; really means is that non-white yoots are as racist as they wanna be, and whites must lay down.   What you&rsquo;ll get from non-white youths is a 24/7 hate-spew against whites,  they don&rsquo;t deign to hide it.  It seems there can hardly be gathering of blacks youths in this country without them beating up a few whites who are stupid or unfortunate enough to wander by.  That&rsquo;s what Liberals mean by &#8220;non-judgmental.&#8221; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad that the right doesn&rsquo;t have an army of dirt-diggers out there photographing the homes and neighborhoods of these Liberals, finding out where they hang around, where their kids went to school, etc. and plastering it all over the internet.  Part of the reason this doesn&rsquo;t happen much is because much of the money and effort of the right is absorbed by the Republican Party and Country Club Conservatism.  They have an tacit agreement with Liberal leadership not to bring up each others  luxurious and essentially segregated life-styles.  Not in the personal or class interests of either.  The Republican Party and Conservatism have a huge class problem, and as long as both are controlled by the effete elitists that now control them they&rsquo;ll never be effective opposition to the left.   They simple don&rsquo;t represent the vast majority of their constituents.  In fact, they loathe them.   </p>

&#8220;The idea the left has been trying to put about, that our political conversations should be conducted in the murmured, genteel tones of National Public Radio, is just a way of trying to shut us up. You can talk the way the presenters talk on All Things Considered when you control the culture, and know it. The left controls the culture. When you own all the broadsheet newspapers, all the mainstream churches, all the colleges and schools and universities, all but one of the TV networks, the Civil Service, the municipal unions, even the Joint Chiefs of Staff for crying out loud  &mdash;  when the whole shebang is marching to your tune, you can afford to play the tune soft and sweet. Conservatives have to yell to make themselves heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And even with all those advantages, even with its thumbs firmly pressed against the national windpipe, the left isn&rsquo;t all sweetness and light. Watch a Keith Olbermann segment.&#8221; <br>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t had actual democracy in the US for a very long time now.  One has only to pay attention before an election and then see the results of the actual election to know that it is RIGGED.  Not just influenced but bearing no resemblance to reality.</p>
<p>McCain getting the nomination?  Please.  The man&rsquo;s career was dead because of his attempt to force amnesty down our throats.  Nobody wanted anything to do with him.  Yet, suddenly, he comes out of left field to win the nomination?  After he lost, his career was supposed to be dead again&hellip;.and again, his attempt at amnesty became the main issue.  Yet, mysteriously, he wins his seat again&hellip;..despite people wanting to burn him in effigy.  He&rsquo;s just laughing at us now.</p>
<p>Obama is a nobody.  As in nobody had ever heard of him.  Worse, he has some of the worst radical, violent crazies associated with him.  Strong reason to suspect he was a MUSLIM, in a post 9/11 world.  And he basically ran on, I&rsquo;m a black man, so elect me to prove you aren&rsquo;t racist.  What percentage of the vote had previous black candidates gotten?  It was in the single digits. </p>
<p>Yet, he comes out of left field to win the nomination, then the election?</p>
<p>Please&hellip;..our elections are rigged and I&rsquo;ve never met anyone who legitimately supported what those in power currently support.</p>
<p>The game isn&rsquo;t about winning elections&hellip;.not anymore.  It&rsquo;s about getting away with as much as you can without sparking a revolution.</p>
<p>Large numbers of people are thinking that way&hellip;..or at least preparing for what they are going to do if they wake up one morning to that.</p>

<p>Like others here, I am somewhat skeptical of your post.   You are under 20, yet you were a  college faculty member nine years ago?  Most extraordinary!  You also write unusually well for someone under twenty, better than most mature posters here.  Too well, I&rsquo;d say, to be a teen-age product of today&rsquo;s dumbed-down education.  </p>
<p>Granted,  in America, class is often inextricably linked with race.  Where does race leave off and class begin? Your generation  (and by no means yours alone!) has been taught to act as if race does not matter   &mdash;    or does not even exist.  Class distinctions, however, are OK with Marxists&hellip; indeed are emphazised.   People need not  necessarily be racially conscious, but are  still deep down  aware of it in a sub-conscious way.  Despite all the PC  disclaimers, how could anyone NOT be aware? Race and ethnicity are fundamental to our being.  We are humans. </p>
<p>Do birds forget that they are sparrows and pigeons, ducks and chickens?  They don&rsquo;t have to think about  who they are. They just &#8220;know&#8221;&hellip; and they gravitate to their own kind.   Does that mean that birds &#8220;racists&#8221;?  Do they hate one another?  No!   They just feel more comfortable among their own.  And so do we.   </p>
<p>It is the  egalitarian-obsessed social engineers who try to make us feel guilty about this.  As Bud put it,  it&rsquo;s been made &#8220;the fashion, enforced with the greatest propaganda campaign in history &hellip; and more than a little muscle.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s the propaganda and the muscle that reveal how artificial it is. Without the propaganda and the muscle, people would not be falling for it. If inter-racial integration were truly  natural, it would take no enforcement or persuading. And certainly no muscle!</p>

<p> &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t older Americans the very ones who went along with all this &ldquo;civil rights,&rdquo; affirmative action, social engineering and racial displacement of whites we&rsquo;ve had over the past 40+ years?&rdquo;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8216;They didn&rsquo;t  go along with it!   It was slipped across on them, like a mickey slipped in their drink.</p>
<p>To put it differently, they fell for the tasty-sounding appetizer, not realizing the rest of the meal that would  later come after it. </p>
<p>Things like the immigration bill, affirmative action, etc. were largely a matter of cunning and deception.  People would never have voted for them if everything were put clearly out on the table.  In fact, people never got to vote on those things at all, anyway. <br>

		<p>Refreshing to hear from #27 in South Africa, confirming the words of one of the ancients who wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may drive Nature out with a pitch fork, yet she&rsquo;ll be constantly running back&rdquo;<br>
                     &mdash;     Horace, The Epistles</p>
<p>Chris Matthews suffers from chronic narcissism, bordering an malignant narcissim.  Like all liberals, he finds it necessary to flatter his own sense of moral superiority by berating his own kind.  Matthews apparently fancies himself a youthful 65 and therefore flatters the 21 - 40 crowd in order to reinforce his &#8220;youthful&#8221; delusion.</p>
<p>Sam Francis&rsquo; words explain his infatuation with Mr. Obama.  From the March 2010 AR cover story, Mr. Francis had written of the soon to be president:  &#8220;Mr. Obama, &hellip; is both a living testament to the power of black racial consciousness and identity and at the very same time a living renunciation of white racial identity.&#8221;<br>
An objective view of Barack Obama would conclude that he is neither white nor black.  He is exactly 50% of each.  Matthews survives in MSNBC thanks to the truth that says &#8220;If it weren&rsquo;t for double standards, liberals wouldn&rsquo;t have any standards at all&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>Mike, it&rsquo;s like that here in SA as well. My parents grew up in the apartheid times and really had very little interaction with blacks(apart from household help) - and the country was generally well run. Whites my age (40) and younger are MUCH more anti-black than our parents. </p>

		<p>I hate to break it to you, but race is just as significant to youth as it is to older generations, it is just that we have been taught to act as if it does not matter. I am very young, not even 20 and race is very significant to me and a great deal of the young people I know.<br>
These sorts of statements are the equivalent of plugging your ears, closing your eyes, and yelling loudly</p>
<p>Two things here. Like a previous poster mentioned, why do you &#8220;hate&#8221; to have to mention the fact that the people you know are race conscious? That is good to hear. No racially conscious person would regret having to make such a statement. </p>
<p>Secondly, I apologize if I am wrong, but I question whether you are younger than 20 years old, a teenager. It is probably safe to say that very, very few teenagers visit this website, even those that may very well be racially aware.</p>
<p>Moreover, very few of them would be sophisitcated enough to couch their statements in the manner that you have. Again, if you are indeed a person in your late teens, I apologize, but the tone of your post suggest otherwise. </p>

Until I started watching TV and seeing what they teach our kids in school I Honestly Had No Idea that the blacks had invented just about everything. I never realized that blacks built empires thousand of years before the white man even existed. (Why don&rsquo;t they use some of that Empire Building Talent) in Detroit or Oakland? But now back to the topic..<br>

<p>I could not agree with you more. No amtter how many of you post aobut young people being more racially conscious and they are our future (to be honest I disagree), the fact is that many of the more affluent ones tend to harbor quite a bit of disdain for lower income Whites.</p>

		<p>Even the young and liberal generally only socialize with others who look like them, with a very few exceptions. (For example, the token asian or black friend.) Dating patterns reveal that most races stay together, even when young people have ample opportunity to mix.</p>

Younger White people feel that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;not supposed&rdquo; to notice race because that&rsquo;s the way they&rsquo;ve been brainwashed in school. I&rsquo;ve even had a couple try to tell me that they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t notice&rdquo; race. But I say that&rsquo;s a load of hooey. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; right now to acknowledge race  &mdash;  unless it&rsquo;s to accuse some White person of &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Considering the totalitarian nature of the Food Safety Modernization Act, one would expect that EVERYONE, black or white, liberal or conservative, would now have a HUGE huge &#8216;problem with Obama&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A law forbidding an activity which is a crucial component of the basis of civilization (small farmers saving seeds, as part of Agriculture)is totalitarian on a par with laws stripping Jews of their citizenship, or the genocide of the Kulaks.  Actually, its ramifications, while less dramatic, would, in aggregate and over time, be worse.  </p>

		<p>A few interracial pairings here and there, and some of them are based on true love so I don&rsquo;t mind that, do not a trend make. The much vaunted black male/white female pairing owes more to black boys pushing themselves on weak-willed white girls with no daddies than anything else.</p>

<p>You both raise an important point. How do you protect children and women from diversity, and yet make sure they still know what they need to know. I&rsquo;ve seen it in my own family, some of the more conservative members move to whiter areas, shelter their children, and they turn out relatively naive, compared to those of us raised in more &#8216;diverse areas.&rsquo; </p>

		<p>For the posters who are mentioning South Africa, I saw a demographic map of South Africa that showed the western half of the country is where it is still majority white.  </p>
<p>Why, for the life of me, doesn&rsquo;t the western half declare independence and ask all non-whites to go to the black side?  They&rsquo;ll have 70% plus of the old south africa, and the best farmland and industrial zones.  Don&rsquo;t whites have any idea that this is their only hope of survival?</p>

		<p>&#8220;I think younger people do not see race as an obstacle. &#8220;</p>
<p>What a cheap quip! Studies last year showed that young children DO notice race.  They were horrified and spoke about how the need to steop up programs to train them out of it. Of course, part of that was an assumption that parents are racist and passing it on to their kids, but that is a cheap escape from reality as well.  The ABILITY to discriminate is a natural survival mechanism.</p>

<p>What a load!  I remember from my school days back in the &rsquo;60s how blacks came on to white girsl;  &#8220;you&rsquo;re not prejudice are you?&#8221;  They had to date them to prove they weren&rsquo;t racists.  If they didn&rsquo;t they yelled, &#8220;You prej&hellip;! and sometimes worse, right in the classroom. Everything I read and heard into the 1980s sounded much like that.  Every black male I have every known had an underlying mission of being around white people for the white women they could net for sex.</p>
<p>TODAY, white girls have been faced with the image of Black SUPERIORITY for a couple decades, along with persistent images in the media of passive or intentional sexual pairing of black men to white women in first pop music, advertising, and now it dominates. It is almost expected that white girls will seek and date black men, since everyone KNOWS that they will have a &#8220;better time&#8221; with a black. Feminists were telling women to not have white babies in the 1980s.  Then we saw the &#8220;voluntary&#8221; result of the Obama Baby phenomena at a college in 2009.  The forcing has gone from a one on one basis to an institutionalized system of social coercion.  </p>

<p>Truman desegregated the military in 1948.  Eisenhower used Federal troops to enforce Brown v. Board at Little Rock&rsquo;s Central High in 1957.  And all this before those wonderful &rsquo;60s.  It&rsquo;s not like this stuff just happened overnight and one day you old folks woke up and Obama was president.  </p>
<p>Sorry but the &#8220;Greatest Generation&#8221; dropped the ball on this like they did raising their idiot kids and saving us from FDR&rsquo;s Third American Revolution.  At some point between Truman&rsquo;s Executive Order desegregating the military in 1948 and the myriad civil rights acts and immigration disaster of the &rsquo;60s one would think you folks would have gotten the picture. </p>
