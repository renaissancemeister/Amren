			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Australian (Sydney), January 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>ISLAMIC preacher Ibrahim Siddiq-Conlon points heavenwards to emphasise his message for the governments of Australia  &mdash;  there is no God but Allah and only his laws should be obeyed. </p>
<p>&#8220;My attack is on the Prime Minister of Australia,&#8221; he said yesterday. &#8220;I hate the parliament in Canberra. I want to go straight for the jugular vein and advise the parliament that they have no right to legislate. They should immediately step down and let the Muslims take over.&#8221;</p>
<p>An Australian-born convert to Islam, Siddiq-Conlon is the self-anointed leader of a group called Sharia4Australia, which is pushing for the introduction of sharia courts as a first step towards achieving Islamic law.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day Australia will live under sharia; it&rsquo;s inevitable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If they (Australians) don&rsquo;t accept it, that&rsquo;s not our problem. We hope, and our objective is to have a peaceful transition, but when you look at history that has never been the case. There&rsquo;s always been a fight. It is inevitable that one day there will be a struggle for Islam in Australia.&#8221;</p>
<p>A masters graduate in architecture from the University of Technology Sydney, Siddiq-Conlon formed Sharia4Australia last year. He said he had three objectives. The first is to persuade Muslims they must hate &#8220;taghoot&#8221;, the worship of any God other than Allah, which includes democracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must hate it, speak out against it. And, if that doesn&rsquo;t work, take action against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His other objectives are to advise elected governments they have no authority to rule, and to educate non-Muslims on the benefits of sharia, including punishments such as stoning adulterers and severing the hands of thieves.</p>
<p>&#8220;If chopping off the hands is the punishment given by the sharia court then we say glad tidings, because chopping off the hands  &mdash;  when you understand what is sharia  &mdash;  is a mercy to that person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is it a mercy getting your hands chopped off? Because it can be expiation for your sins. It is better to get punished in this life than to go underground into the grave or into the hellfire for eternity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Siddiq-Conlon will join a debate tonight at the Parramatta Town Hall in Sydney on the merits of sharia versus democracy. The event was organised by self-styled debate promoter Zaky Mallah, who was acquitted of terrorism charges in 2005 but pleaded guilty to threatening to kill a commonwealth officer after his passport was cancelled.</p>
<p>The pro-democracy case will be argued by an Australian army veteran, self-described &#8220;concerned Aussie&#8221; and senior member of the pro-gun Firearms Forum, Jack Zedee. &#8220;The issue with Mr Conlon and Sharia4Australia is they are preaching hatred. His views horrify me,&#8221; Mr Zedee told The Australian.</p>
<p>Police and private security are expected at the debate, after both sides claimed to have received death threats. Mallah said he had tried to cancel the event but the debaters insisted on proceeding.</p>
<p>Siddiq-Conlon shrugs off concerns his campaign will damage the moderate Muslim community. &#8220;If it causes a backlash against the Muslims, I can&rsquo;t help that. This is a necessary debate.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Let me guess, he&rsquo;s also black! I am interested to see how this is gonna play out for sure as the next step is going to be making the same demands in America as soon as there are about 5 million more muslim imported into the U.S. and established in their Michiganistan beach head. It&rsquo;s coming! Weapons and ammo and food stuffs are our friends, get them while we still can.</p>

		<p> Well he&rsquo;s theologically right as far as Islam is concerned the growth by warfare is completely fair. We as Christians need to be ready to defend the faith. Either they win or we do it&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>

		<p>I am waiting for the average Western Citizens, no matter what country they live in, to take to the streets with torches and pitchforks, and chase the foreign invaders, and traitorous politicians, out of their Nations.</p>
<p>I wonder what it will take for people to say, &#8220;Enough is enough!&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Before we all go mad with rage we must allow this man to preach his views for this is the only way that those sitting on the fence will realise the great danger they are all in. But all schools must, as part of their approved history and current affairs subjects, teach what Islam really is about, the truth, warts and all.  A system of mass control, not a religion in the modern sense.  And we must return to our religions, Christianity, Judaism, and Buddhism, etc, the benign full of love religions so that the youth that are at a loss with little direction in their lives are not seduced by the seeming only religion that is available to them, Islam.  And the discussion that is planned needs to be recorded and broadcast free of charge to the World.</p>

<p>Both of these religions are feuding siblings from the same family.  I wish they would cancel one another out.  Any whites willing to go to war for Christianity are brainwashed dupes, not different from this Australian convert.</p>
<p>Neither of these religions have been kind to white, Europeans.  In fact, throughout its history of conquest and spread, Christianity has so far caused far more pain and suffering than Islam has to date.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean that Islam won&rsquo;t match or even exceed Christianity, but we don&rsquo;t need either.  We need our own indigenous spirit and outlooks based on our own ancestry and history, not that of the Middle East.</p>

		<p>I agree poster#7, we have to allow this guy to preach as he does so Whites and Christians and White Christians can see the danger and reality of Islam and it&rsquo;s goals.<br>
BUT we also have to SPEAK OUT constantly to make folks aware his spouting is NOT &#8220;just some aberrant ravings of a fringe in Islam&#8221; or that we should ignore his type as the media WILL play it.  He represents the REAL FACE of Islam.  He has just jumped the gun in his revealing true Islam in his zeal, but the message IS true Islam.  That IS the purpose of Islamic immigrants - to colonize.  To supplant.  To force all nations under Islam.  We have seen the black man be all mild and nice to our faces, and claiming to just want &#8220;equality&#8221;.  We have also seen the face of the black race when they have sufficient numbers - hatred of the White race, ever increasing demands, and violence.<br>
Islam is no different.  When they get sufficient numbers, they WILL take off the mask.<br>
Western nations are fools for allowing ANY of them in, and leaders of nations who inflict this madness on their citizens are TRAITORS pure and simple.</p>
