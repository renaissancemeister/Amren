<h1><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2011/01/big_stimulus_money_for_detroit.html">Big Stimulus Money for Detroit Public Schools</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>J. Robert Smith, American Thinker, January 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} We learn that $49 million of taxpayer money has been procured by Detroit public schools for laptops for students and teachers. The money comes from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>
<p>All the new technology is fine as it goes, but there&rsquo;s a hitch. Detroit public school kids have trouble with the basics, like simple math, reading, and writing. In fact, a little over a year ago, a whopping 69% of Detroit fourth-graders scored &#8220;below basic&#8221; on math testing. The scores have dropped to an historic low. Reading and science scores aren&rsquo;t impressive either. According to the Education Policy Center at Michigan State University, only 31.9% of Detroit&rsquo;s public school students graduate in four years. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So why $49 million for laptops when too many Detroit kids can&rsquo;t successfully use old fashioned pencils and paper to write simple words and sentences and do basic math? Why stuff like Kindle when kids can&rsquo;t even read from cardboard and paper books?</p>
<p>The trouble with Detroit public schools has nothing to do with technology. The trouble is with too many teachers who can&rsquo;t teach, too many parents who don&rsquo;t parent, and a welfare and inner city culture that eschews conventional achievement and advancement. And an incompetent, self-centered, and often corrupt political establishment that benefits from the status quo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One Detroit school teacher was caught trying to pawn her stimulus money laptop. One wonders: Did the teacher need the bucks, or was she just acknowledging the futility of having a school laptop in the first place?</p>

<p>Anyone need more of an illustration on why the DPS system is beyond worthless? </p>
<p>The thugocracy that runs that system has no interest in any changes in their monopoly.  They are content to keep the students on their plantation of ignorance rather than the marketplace of ideas and private education where the students could only benefit. </p>
<p>The parents are also to blame, as they lack the drive or interest in getting better education for their children. </p>
<p>These kids are already laps behind other US children solely because of their education. Their DNA does not help them either. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not the skillsets, it&rsquo;s the IQ variance in acquiring them.</p>
<p>We are being forced, ever more rapidly into a scenario, both politically and economically, where what should be thoughtfully considered and researched decisions must be made at speed using canned statistics and online supported reasoning.</p>
<p>It may well be that whites, with higher baseline IQs, will excel in this, given training and early immersion in the virtual over paper experience of education, though I worry about thintelligence as a lack of ontoological interlinks between subjects (you have to know contingent relevance in order to use it to support an argument).</p>
<p>But I also expect that changes in the way we &#8216;think as we do&rsquo; (the standard model of the English school boy with his tongue stuck out as he practices his english forms) will indeed require changes in the way we teach education as conceptualism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too bad that giving children the symbols of wealth and high intellect means so little to &#8216;inner city youth&rsquo; because generation regression to the mean of a racial 87 IQ is always going to trap even the children of smart Detroiters in a bog of high expectations and low genetic delivery capability.</p>

		<p>No, this article has it all wrong.  Don&rsquo;t criticize the initiative.  As a long time teacher in an urban setting, I can tell you that the computers are like a soothing balm to the otherwise wild and uncontrollable &#8216;students.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Give the teachers a break from the insanity.  When a &#8216;youth&rsquo; has a computer in front of him, he instantly goes to music sites, (they all use proxy sites to open everything blocked) and watch movies and chat on myspace.  </p>
<p>They stop disrupting the class almost completely, and the teacher can focus on the 5-10% of the class that really wants to learn something.  The &#8216;magical device,&rsquo; as Steve Jobs described his Ipad, is truly that.  It keeps gangbangers in their seats.</p>
<p>Does this assessment sound harsh to you?  Do the teachers, parents, Bill Gate&rsquo;s of the world and politicos herald the wonder of the computers and how it will solve all our educational woes?</p>
<p>Yeah, but it all boils down to what I have described, even though no one will admit it.</p>

<p>It just confirms the old story about giving away fish:  If you give a man a fish, he eats for a day, but if you feed a fish-begging man to the fishes, then you don&rsquo;t have to keep giving him, his kids, his grand kids and his great grand kids fish every day of their pointless lives.</p>

		<p>The Detroit $49-milion-on-laptops experiment recalls the famed Kansas City experiment of the late eighties:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the mid-1980s, a Federal district judge &hellip;  required the school district and state of Missouri to spend about an additional $1.5 billion, that&rsquo;s BILLION, in a district with, at the start, some 40,000 students. That works out to about $40,000 in extra spending per student, which left other districts in the state scrambling for funds. </p>
<p>&#8220;Expensive schools were built. One new high school features an Olympic size swimming pool, complete with a room permitting underwater viewing. A former coach of a Russian Olympic fencing team was hired to coach a district fencing team. A miniature United Nations system was introduced with simultaneous translations in different languages. </p>
<p>&#8220;The result? Dropout rates went up; enrollment continued to decline and achievement rates were stagnant or sagged. Oddly, what progress was made tended to be in schools that weren&rsquo;t modernized.&#8221; (David W. Kilpatrick, education columnist, 2001) </p>

		<p>This is one reason why the community organizer wanted to be president.  He&rsquo;s able to shift stimulus money to black districts.</p>
<p>This too will turn to junk after a while and these black unteachables will be failing as usual.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all part of the scheme this anti-white man and his anti-white wife are promoting in order to do what they think will raise black accomplishment somehow, in full denial that intelligence can&rsquo;t be improved by computers, money or improving diets, as Michelle Obama believes, which is why she&rsquo;s pushing for better nutrition.</p>
<p>In the process of all this diet improvement and stimulus money it could well happen that many white kids will benefit as an unintended consequence these people never figured on.</p>

<p>Detoilet is like any other post-colonial African city. There is a tiny functioning infrastructure maintained by mountains of US taxpayer dollars stolen from two generations hence and a tinier still group of white men who keep the lights on and the machinery turning. <br>

		<p>Exactly right, if you can&rsquo;t read or write in the first place, how can you either use the computer or even know what is what on the screen if you did manage to get it to work?</p>
<p>And the complaint will be then that we want Internet connection, then fast Internet connection, and then WiFI connection and then FAST WiFi connection. &#8220;Otherwise we can&rsquo;t learn ya&rsquo;ll!&#8221;<br>
And as for the skills and abilities of the &#8220;students&#8221;, not much if anything will change.</p>

		<p>So typical of black thinking. Its not the substance it is always<br>
 the image that counts. Along these lines the have built a new<br>
high school here in Ward 8, Anacostia, Washington DC. The building<br>
looks like a corporate headquarters. It is 5 stories of glass,<br>
and steel, sweeping driveways, sculptures on the lawn, swimming<br>
pools, planetariums, computer labs, Olympic track, parking lots full of   the BMWs and Mercedes of the black teachers..most of whom cannot pass any sort of standardized test in their own subject matter. As for the students themselves the drop out rate is 60% and teen pregnancy is normal. Reading scores are stuck at a 3rd gradelevel and math ability consists of counting money from dope deals. And finally..Ward 8, Anacostia has elected Marion Barry as their councilman every year for decades. The more crimes he is convicted of, cocaine, bribery, soliciting prostitution,  the more they love him.</p>

<p>The school bought laptops instead of desktop computers so they can steal them easier. At least the Gangstas will be able to post and view their beat and rape whitey videos on Youba-tuba. </p>
<p>This mentality reminds me of a guy in one of my college classes. He was getting an F, had not done one assignment by mid semester, would spend all class time outside on his cell phone, and was trying to convince the teacher that the reason he didn&rsquo;t do any work was because he needed a new laptop. I wanted the teacher to write the Dean a letter, so that financial aid would give him $2000 for a new laptop. The kicker is that the class didn&rsquo;t require a laptop to do the work. Want to guess his skin color? Close your eyes and you can see his skin color. </p>
<p>I think that guy will graduate and get a good job before me.</p>

		<p>Sure we are throwing money away but where is it really going? Is that 49 million dollars going to help children in Detroit or is it going to the company that needs to sell $49M worth of lap tops. </p>
<p>I started school in one of the poorest areas of the country in 1960. The old two room school didn&rsquo;t even have indoor plumbing and there was an old coal burning heater at the back of the room and the text books were old enough to have come over on the May Flower. My dad learned to read mostly by reading comic books back during the great depression. </p>
<p>The only things required for a child to learn to read is a will to learn and someone to teach. Millions of people have learned to read with nothing more than a black board and a slate and chalk.</p>
<p>I actually think they would do better to go back to basics and try to teach the three Rs then at least the kids would be able to read and do simple math and it wouldn&rsquo;t cost very much. </p>

		<p>Hello,</p>
<p>A few recent observations this week:</p>
<p>Blacks who act like fools cant learn  &mdash;  BLAME THE TEACHERS</p>
<p>Blacks who train pit bulls to attack  &mdash;  BLAME THE PITBULLS</p>
<p>Right now,,,black culture is destroying everything  &mdash;  -even DOGS.</p>
<p> Reading this article finished off my work week nicely. I teach the type of students that we are talking about.  The article is correct by saying that teachers cant teach. While most white men were watching ESPN for the past few decades or so, loudmouth blacks have destroyed the educational system we had. Loudmouth blacks and white students who aspire to be black decide when and for how long they will shut their mouths so the teacher can teach. Correct  &mdash;  teachers cant teach  &mdash;  because we can&rsquo;t get them to shut up  &mdash;  we cant make them leave the classrooms and we cant get support from the liberal administration to have them thrown out of school. For some reason, America feels that it is the duty and right of black students to ruin any chance of others to receive an education. Sounds like a great plan for the future.</p>
<p>I can tell that Jay is a real teacher as well as a few others who posted here like Bon.</p>
<p>About the computers. </p>
<p>It is easier to request 30k worth of laptops for your classroom than it is to get 30 dollars worth of real teaching supplies from the state or county. Why  &mdash;  -because politicians look good when they take responsibility for pumping junk computers in the faces of students who are not willing to learn. (ask Jay,,im sure he will back me on this) They may even get their face on the news because of it.</p>
<p>Also, my county has a special deal worked out with DELL where the state and county buy computers every year and dispose of the 1-2 year old computers. I know,,because it is my responsibility at times to shrink wrap the old (1-2 yr) computers for shipping to the warehouse where somebody on the inside (most likely a minority owned business) will bid on them and steal the whole bunch from the taxpayers and sell them later. </p>
<p>Please understand  &mdash;  -politicians love to build new school buildings and stuff classrooms with computers. They get no credit for giving us what we really need or request in the classroom.(like paper or pencils) When the Dems run for office,,,they can afford a 90 million dollar new school but cant afford to provide us with paper or a copier. There are tons of brand new school buildings with no supplies in them to teach with.  &mdash;  but the sponsoring DEM&rsquo;s nametag is on the cornerstone. It is even better of course if the students are black. The dream of most liberal politicians is to give computers to minorities so they can play video games and other nonsense on them  &mdash;  or perhaps,,the more enterprising minorities can use the computers to figure out a way to further grift more taxpayer funds and get a free college education.</p>
<p>Jay is correct about the computers soothing the problem students.</p>
<p>At first,,,i got upset when the students were not completing the tasks that I asked them on the computers  &mdash;  but then I realized,,,with or without the computers,,they would not follow instructions anyway. Jay is correct,,,it does allow you to focus on the few who have the discipline and will to learn. It keeps the wild ones semi-quiet for a few minutes so that some learning can take place. We have allowed BLACKS to dictate when and how much every student can learn. (And dont think I want to allow it  &mdash;  -but there is no administrative backup)</p>
<p>I guess it is easier to blame the teachers for the fact that blacks usually dont have the discipline to learn in the classroom. I once had a very good student from Tanzania  &mdash;  -he was a respectful, intelligent student who understood that most African American students were not fit for the classroom setting. He explained to me that in his home country, the teacher would use a stick to tame unruly black students. When I had a few black students acting up the 1st quarter  &mdash;  -he actually offered to find me a stick like his old teacher used in Tanzania. Of course,,I explained that in this country,,we can&rsquo;t do that. I guess facing off with the blacks is somehow perceived as more difficult than planting potatoes for ourselves (to survive) after we sit back and allow them to turn us into a third world country overnight.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Reading between the lines of this article, I gather that actually paying for broadband internet service is cramping their style, and reducing the number of dime bags they can purchase from the local amateur pharmacologist.  So they want us to pay for it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been one to blame the teachers. I believe most teachers in most urban settings are rowing up stream without a paddle.</p>
<p>While the right blames teachers unions for the failure to educate blacks, the left blames teachers and testing. I listen to local black talk radio and when the topic of education comes up, blacks call in to complain about the teachers not teaching their children; as if the teachers have some special, magical power to turn their precious babies into highly paid, successful working adults but that the teachers aren&rsquo;t using their magical power to help their children. Let&rsquo;s face it, these teachers just aren&rsquo;t using their powers of alchemy to transform base metals into gold and blacks know this to be the fact!   </p>
<p>Of course, you can&rsquo;t make a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear but blacks believe you can but teachers just aren&rsquo;t trying.<br>

		<p>))) I taught school for many years. I never considered myself to be racist in any way. Then as the influx of blacks grew and their attitude toward, rules, laws, decency destroyed all that was right I came to realize how few of these people want anything more than what you have For Free.<br>
There are exceptions but they are few and far between.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The trouble with Detroit public schools has nothing to do with technology. The trouble is with too many teachers who can&rsquo;t teach, too many parents who don&rsquo;t parent, and a welfare and inner city culture that eschews conventional achievement and advancement. And an incompetent, self-centered, and often corrupt political establishment that benefits from the status quo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget a student body that is almost entirely black.  I think that might be the root cause of the problem, no?</p>
<p>On a similar note to the article, my school also wastes a tremendous amount of money on worthless technology.  This year  our science classrooms were fitted with multi-thousand-dollar &#8220;SmartBoards&#8221; - huge touch-screen monitors that take up one-half of what used to be the dry-erase boards, and that are laughably glitchy.  My Physics teacher has given up trying to use his, because whenever he writes something on the screen, it comes out nearly-uncomprehensible, even though his handwriting on normal surfaces is very legible.  And whenever he tries to use the SmartBoard&rsquo;s calculator, it takes about ten minutes to do an equation because the touch-screen buttons stick and every thing gets entered twice.  Oh yeah, and we also got these pointless &#8220;probe&#8221; things that allow you to make graphs during a lab.  All you do is hold the probe - which must have cost hundreds of dollars apiece - in front of you, while a lab partner walks away from it, and then back.  The probe records a graph of their speed and distance, and then you do some stupid equation related to the graph.  It takes about five minutes, is entirely pointless, and far too expensive to justify, even if it did aid in our learning of physics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re finding your voice, Comrade.  You need to &#8216;speak out&rsquo; as much as possible (well, as much as is possible in this PC reign of terror).</p>
<p>I maintain the vast majority of the public does not know what goes on behind schoolhouse doors.  The prevailing CW promoted by the media is that black failure is due to being forced to deal with an oppressive White system. </p>
<p>Every teachers&rsquo; meeting and professional development I&rsquo;ve ever attended is based on this premise. </p>
<p>You, Jay and I serve an important role (and I feel it is our duty) in educating the public as to where and how White taxpayer money is being spent when it comes to educating the next generation (of mostly non-Whites).  I&rsquo;m sure a lot don&rsquo;t want to hear what we have to say, I myself have been accused of exaggerating, but I assure everyone, I do not have to exaggerate a thing.</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p><i>For some reason, America feels that it is the duty and right of black students to ruin any chance of others to receive an education.</i></p>
<p>Yes, and I believe It is affront to and in violation of one&rsquo;s Civil Rights to deprive a child of an eduction because an out of control black with an IQ of 85 gets to dictate the standards of the classroom, HE gets to determine, by his aberrant behavior, whether or not the teacher can teach that day.  He well knows that the administration is not only going to back him up and not you, but that you will be subjected to a lot of grief.</p>
<p>And, it is getting worse, much worse as special Ed students (overwhelmingly black) are being increasingly mainstreamed into regular classrooms to cut costs (don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you otherwise, it costs three times as much for special Ed students as it does for any other student).</p>
<p>A colleague (in my district but not school) told me that he was recently mandated to attend a meeting with the principal, a horrible special Ed student that was tearing his room apart, the student&rsquo;s illiterate mother, <i>a lawyer and a black advocate.</i></p>
<p>My district has implemented a new suspension system that is on-line only and involves an inordinate amount of time to fill out, plus my district&rsquo;s site is so poorly organized and maintained that it is often difficult, if not impossible to log on.  An inside source told me this system was implemented to make it as difficult as possible for teachers to suspend students (so the teacher would give up).</p>
<p>There is a lot more I&rsquo;d like to write but I&rsquo;ll stop there in the interests of brevity, space and time.</p>
<p>I am leaving my e mail open for you and Jay if either of you would like to contact me off-line.  I&rsquo;d be interested in hearing about your experiences, although I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re not far off of my own.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

<p>I will take this a step further.  White kids have learned how to play this game from the blacks, and I can assure you that it is nearly impossible to punish, suspend, or expel a student for any reason.  They kids have learned how to say &#8220;no&#8221; and the admin will back them.  The correct political view is that all students are good students and they are dying to learn, but they are unable to do so to due to the incompetence of the teacher.</p>
<p>I am convinced that public education is finished in this country - I know I would not send my kids to a public period for one day.</p>
