			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kimberly Dvorak, Examiner, January 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State lawmakers, led by Daryl Metcalfe of Pennsylvania, held a press conference in Washington, DC Wednesday to unveil their new nationwide legislative campaign to correct the misapplication to the 14th Amendment and end automatic birthright citizenship (BRC) in the U.S. to babies born of illegal aliens, so-called &#8216;anchor babies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
&#8220;According to the 14th Amendment, the primary requirements for U.S. citizenship are dependent on total allegiance to America, not mere physical geography,&#8221; explained Metcalfe. &#8220;The purpose of this model legislation is to restore the original intent of the 14th Amendment, which is currently being misapplied and is encouraging illegal aliens to cross (illegally into U.S.) and cost American taxpayers $113 billion annually, or nearly $1,117 yearly per individual taxpayer.&#8221; </p>
<p>According to State Legislators for Legal Immigration (SLLI), hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens are unlawfully crossing U.S. borders to give birth and exploit their child as &#8220;anchor babies,&#8221; as a means to obtain residency, access taxpayer-funded benefits and acquire American jobs. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state legislators say much confusion has surrounded the 14th Amendment and the Constitutional ramifications have resulted in the anchor baby status. However, the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) has now provided expert legal research and analysis to ensure the plain English- straightforward legislative solution will meet any Constitutional challenges brought against it once enacted by state Legislatures across the nation. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new coalition includes lawmakers from 40 state legislatures  &mdash;  all working to solve the nation&rsquo;s illegal immigration crisis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new Republican leadership in the House does plan to address the birthright citizenship problem, but only after taking up legislation dealing with workplace enforcement, including requiring the use of the E-Verify program, and ensuring jobs go to American citizens instead of illegal aliens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The United States and Canada are the last remaining developed nations in the world that still give automatic citizenship to babies born of illegal aliens and foreign citizens. All other first-world countries have stopped BRC abuse in their countries. Ireland, France, Australia, and New Zealand have all repealed BRC in the past 20 years. </p>
<p>Schwilk [Jeff Schwilk, spokesman for the SoCal Patriot Coalition] points out that anchor babies are really welfare babies, allowing illegal alien parents to apply for and receive welfare, healthcare, and other U.S. social benefits that can amount to thousands of dollars in &#8216;free&rsquo; money each month per anchor baby for the illegal alien parents.</p>
<p>All these benefits are paid for by U.S. taxpayers and it amounts to tens of billions of dollars per year nationally. Not surprisingly some anti-anchor baby advocates call them &#8220;jackpot babies&#8221; for poor illegal aliens looking for a way out of poverty.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Mexico, China, and other countries are abusing the U.S. anchor baby loophole as well by encouraging their female citizens to give birth in the America.</p>
<p>&#8220;Birth Tourism&#8221; has become a billion-dollar industry due to America&rsquo;s lax immigration and citizenship laws. More than a half a million anchor babies are now born in the U.S. each year, creating instant U.S. citizens status for the foreign parents who have foreign loyalties and connections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another factor that makes the case for ending BRC is Mexico grants automatic Mexican citizenship to all babies born in the U.S. or anywhere outside Mexico. These babies already have automatic citizenship at birth, Mexican citizenship, and many people contend America should not give out free U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;By giving automatic citizenship to millions of Mexican citizen babies at birth, the U.S. Government has, perhaps unwittingly, created millions of new dual citizens who have strong loyalties to Mexico, especially when they grow up with Mexican parents and families in the U.S.,&#8221; Schwilk added. </p>
<p>Not surprising the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) has a much different opinion on the birthright citizenship issue.</p>

		<p>I think it is pretty clear now that La Raza advocates for foreign invasion, for the taking of sovereign US territory, and has threatened riots and violence as a means to an end, and has renounced the US Constitution and in fact subverts it.  Long past due is the time to designate La Raza as a subversive terrorist organization, seize all it&rsquo;s assets, arrest it&rsquo;s leaders, deny it any voice in any form of media, and expel the invaders who are already here.  Every - single - one of them.  To the last anchor baby.<br>

		<p>Here are presentations by three constitutional scholars on the error of current U. S. policy on &#8220;birthright citizenship&#8221; as regards children of illegal aliens.  These presentations range from the brief: a 5-minute video (Chapman) to essay-length detail (Graglia):</p>
<p>JOHN EASTMAN, Dean, Chapman University School of Law on the fallacy of &ldquo;automatic birthight citizenship&rdquo;  &mdash;  as applied to children born to tourists and children of illegal aliens: 5 minute video. Dr. Eastman outlines three potential methods to correct the crisis:<br>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a two-minute treat: a spectacularly-biased CNN report on the push to end abuse of the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s &ldquo;Citizenship Clause&rdquo; which is producing 380,000 new U. S. &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; each year by the U. S. policy of granting citizenship to the chlidren of foreigners in the U. S. illegally.</p>

		<p>brc should have been addressed years ago.  even today, the politicians are more worried about votes as in trying to have the &#8220;dream&#8221; act passed = delusional thinking.  main problem, today&rsquo;s leaders are not for America but for staying in power for eons.</p>

		<p>A report on Fox News yesterday mentioned this and the fact that 14 states are taking on this issue locally and will attempt to approach the Feds that way. This is happening with so many issues now that the individual states are angrily pursuing completely different tracks that the one the Federal [so-called] government is trying to take us. This should have been repealed years ago, and the fact that 20 other countries have done so in the last few years bodes well for a coming fight over it in the U.S., however, it will be too little too late.</p>

		<p>I understand and have agreed with enforcing the laws to keep illegal aliens out of the U.S.  I have read all the arguments and most looked sound.  Then I learned some seemingly unrelated information and it is giving me second thoughts.  </p>
<p>An ice age that would freeze over the U.S. is very probable.  It would come on in a mere 10 years from its onset and take many many years to recede.  The remaining livable parts of the earth could not support us all.</p>
<p>How does this relate to illegal immigration?  The tables will turn.  We will need Mexico to accept and help us.  We will not want to be their illegal aliens.  It is time to open up our borders and welcome our neighbors in need.  Unreasonable laws create criminals.  </p>
<p>I see the hate building.  It is the same attitude that has cropped up throughout our short history.  We had it towards Native Americans, blacks, Italians, Asians, Irish, and anybody except those of English ancestry.  We have had immigration quotas where we would allow more white-skinned immigrants than darker skinned.  History repeats itself over and over again.  We learn the wrong of hating one people only to immediately turn and hate another.  It will come back to haunt us.<br>

<p>Grandma, you must have watched Al Gore&rsquo;s propaganda or Art Bell&rsquo;s&hellip;.as for you seeing the &#8220;hate building&#8221;, you sound just like the lefties or La Raza. Think they don&rsquo;t HATE us? Think again.</p>
<p>As for your disdain of allowing White skinned immigrants over dark skinned ones, YES it USED to be that way and WHY do you have a problem with that? That was taken for granted by our Founders!  America was formed and built by WHITE Europeans FOR Whites. Do you see Mexico allowing ANY immigrant into their country?  Why not? If you are trying to make us feel more White &#8220;guilt&#8221; for being White and forming and KEEPING our OWN country, forget it. I never fell for that propaganda in the first place and never will. WE deserve to have the heritage and destiny our founders and ancestors passed down to us and our progeny, and I intend to keep it.</p>
<p>BTW, I am a grandma and great-grandma and not prone to sobbing and wringing my hands over some slight or offense some minority may have with me or my race!</p>

<p>Somebody apparently watched &#8220;The Day After Tomorrow&#8221; and took it way too seriously. There is no evidence whatsoever of an impending ice age, first of all. Secondly, even if such an incredible scenario actually took place, there is no evidence to suggest that the Mexicans would actually accept a large number of white American immigrants, whatever our current immigration policy. I base this mostly on how Mexicans run their own (highly restrictive, by American standards) immigration policy, which strictly limits total immigration.</p>

		<p>Babies should be born into the nationality of the parents, period.  If the parents are french, the baby should legally be french  &mdash;  and so on.  Really, who would argue this other than people who want to come in, drop a baby, and feed off our system????</p>
