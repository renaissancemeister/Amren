			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), January 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama provoked fresh outrage today after taking a 20-man motorcade to visit a childhood friend during his lavish Christmas holiday in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The 10-vehicle convoy drove the president and wife Michelle from his rental property in Kailua, across highways cleared of traffic and through a military community to reach Bobby Titcomb&rsquo;s beachfront house.</p>
<p>Mr Obama, who spent eight years at Punahou School in Hawaii before graduating in 1979, has splashed out $1.5m on his trip  &mdash;  a decision that will not endear him to the millions of Americans facing economic hardship in the New Year.</p>
<p>The extra cost of the excessive security levels demanded by the holidaying Mr Obama will further enrage opponents of the 49-year-old, who will return to work on January 3.</p>
<p>After a game of golf with his old friends in the day, the president ate at the barbecue, played volleyball and relaxed on the beach with family and friends, White House spokesman Bill Burton said.</p>
<p>Police had stopped cars along the route at on ramps and side streets. Onlookers were often waving or flashing the famous shaka sign.</p>
<p>While enjoying the barbecue the president&rsquo;s men, armed to the teeth, carefully guarded the area, and waterways, against any possible attack.</p>
<p>Near Dillingham Airfield a group unveiled a sign which read: &#8216;Hi, Mr. Prez.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The airfield, frequented by gliders and parachute jumpers, was dormant due to security for the President. Bill Star, one the operators of Original Glider Rides, lamented the lost business as it was the first day of excellent weather this week.</p>
<p>Mr Obama, who also visited Mr Titcomb on the same day a year ago, is facing claims that he could have been more frugal in his two-week getaway with wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha at a luxury beachfront rental home in Kailua, an upscale resort about 12 miles from the capital, Honolulu.</p>
<p>According to the Hawaii Reporter, the bill for the trip included: </p>
<p>* $63,000 on an early flight bringing Mrs Obama and the children to Hawaii ahead of the president.</p>
<p>* $1,000,000 on Mr Obama&rsquo;s return trip from Washington on Air Force One.</p>
<p>* $38,000 for the &#8216;Winter White House&rsquo; the president has rented for his family on the beach.</p>
<p>* $16,000 to rent beachfront homes for Secret Service and Navy Seals.</p>
<p>* $134,000 for 24 White House staff to stay at the Moana Hotel.</p>
<p>* $251,000 in police overtime.</p>
<p>* $10,000 for an ambulance to be on hand at all times </p>
<p>And those tallies do not include the travel costs of Mr Obama&rsquo;s staff and Secret Service, car rentals and surveillance operations in advance of the trip, which could easily add up to more than Â£30,000.</p>
<p>The White House would not comment on the cost of the stay. </p>
<p>A spokesman said the president&rsquo;s holiday expenses are in line with those of previous presidents.</p>
<p>But the Hawaii Reporter claimed: &#8216;They could have chosen a less expensive and more secure place to stay such as a beachfront home on the Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station  &mdash;  just a two-minute drive away from the Kailuana Place property where they are now. </p>
<p>&#8216;The president visits the military base daily to workout, bowl with his kids or enjoy the more private beach there. &#8216;He also could have stayed at a home 15 minutes away on the beach fronting Bellows Air Force Base as President Bill Clinton did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The 7,000 square foot home where the president is vacationing has five bedrooms, a media room and a secluded lagoon-style pool with tropical waterfalls and a spa.</p>
<p>The Obamas holidayed at the same spot last year, but rising fuel costs have pushed up the estimated travel costs and the president flew later than the rest of his family because of delayed votes in Washington, adding more to the escalating expenses.</p>
<p>The Honolulu Police Department said overtime for officers cost $250,000 last year, compared to $106,000 in 2008 before his inauguration.</p>
<p>The President has no intention of going to a new location for his vacations.</p>
<p>Mr Burton, who is with the president in Hawaii, said: &#8216;Like most Americans, the president knows what he likes in his own hometown.</p>
<p>&#8216;He&rsquo;s been going to a lot of these places since he was a very young child and they hold an important place in his life.&rsquo;<br>

<p>Well, you get what you voted for with this one; he is the very epitome of multicultural effete-totalitarianism at its zenith. He is big on nebulous slogans and singsong refrains, but of little substance and absolutely no value in reality. He demands redistributive sacrifice and self-destructive altruism from those in the white &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; class (even if they make $8.00 or less an hour,) while simultaneously wallowing in his ill-gotten taxpayer funded luxuries and whimsies.  </p>
<p>Normally, I would compare him to someone like Stalin or Lenin; however, what he really is like is Leonid Brezhnev or even Czar Nicholas. He is completely dedicated only to his own egotistical aggrandizement, while the society he is supposed to be governing agonizingly deteriorates at best, and at worst lurches toward civil war and chaos.</p>

		<p>This is ALWAYS the case whenever the Pres travels, whoever the Pres. What is it, when the Pres goes somewhere, the entourage totals about 4,000 folks each time involved in some capacity. Air Force One, the back up Air Force One, the various transport aircraft that carry the vehicles for the Pres and the Secret Service, the Secret Service guarding and standing watch, the plainclothes Special Forces that mingle with the crowds, etc.</p>
<p>An entourage of enormous proportions including the advance party, the Pres and his group, aircraft standby on the ground, etc. A small army of personnel WHEN EVER the Pres travels.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that Michelle and &#8220;the kids&#8221; enjoyed a similar regal vacation in Spain only a few months ago, when they popped eyes in Europe with the lavishness and scale of their expenses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful, no doubt, when you can get someone else to foot the bill. </p>
<p>Incidentally, they concentrated on Granada and the monuments of Afro-Moorish Spain. With all the beautiful and historical places in Spain, why just those?  I found this special  interest in Islamic Spain very significant   &mdash;   although the press passed right over it without a blip of notice.</p>
<p>If the neutered press were awake, it should have drawn a lot of attention.</p>
<p>(And isn&rsquo;t it interesting too, that this is one more news item that we learn from the UK?  &mdash;   not from the US press.)</p>

<p>I believe this kind of &#8220;Big Man&#8221; behavior is what these people call &#8220;havin&rsquo; a posse.&#8221; Prez-denn Mack Daddy, he be livin&rsquo; LARGE, yo!</p>
<p>To #7 Jeddermann and others who argue that these figures etc are not unusual because moving around ANY president is a costly, cumbersome business, well, sure, it has certainly become so in recent decades. It costs an awful lot to transport even a short distance the most powerful man in the world without having him shot at or blown up. And no doubt the costs of doing this for W and Clinton were very high also. But does the above description of the Obama entourage not sound lavish and wasteful even by presidential standards? Would it surprise you to find that Obama&rsquo;s vanity and grandiosity causes him to run up the travel tab even higher than any previous POTUS? </p>
<p>Because that wouldn&rsquo;t surprise ME at all. In fact, it&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;d expect from an Affirmative-Action Champagne Socialist and his Afro-American Marie Antoinette of a wife. </p>
<p>And all this just to visit to some old bud from gradeschool. Couldn&rsquo;t Obama have had his friend transported to come visit him in DC instead, for about 1/100th of the price? </p>

		<p>When Reagan was president he was frequently derided in the MSM for the number of vacations he took. Watch the American media remain almost completely silent about Obama&rsquo;s expensive vacations.</p>
<p>Is this kind of flamboyance at the taxpayer&rsquo;s expense typical of black &#8220;leaders?&#8221; There have been scandals involving Gary elected officials staying at the most expensive hotels when attending mayor&rsquo;s conferences. Now the city of Gary is in such dire financial straits that several firehouses have been closed and several libraries may follow, including the main branch in the downtown area.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d just like to say that I think obama is well-intentioned but naive. He shouldn&rsquo;t be taking a holiday when America&rsquo;s economy is still so shaky. But I&rsquo;d also like to remind everyone that George Bush during the first 3 years of his presidency spent 250 days of his time in office on vactaion (27% of the time) and that around 150 were spent travelling to or at his ranch in Texas (presumably using the same plane which Obama used to fly to Hawaii at the cost of $1 million)</p>

<p>Staying at a ranch is a lot less expensive than constantly jetting off to Hawaii, Europe and other destinations with your entourage (&#8220;posse&#8221; in their terms). Moreover, Michelle and her crew often take vacations without the company of her husband.</p>

		<p>There is alot of bitterness over Obama and liberalism with many people of the opinion that people got what they voted for with Obama.</p>
<p>But did we really?  Obama is the most radical of the radical leftists ever to come anywhere near the presidency.  More suspicious is background which is disreputable at best.  Let me put it to you straight.  Do you know anyone&hellip;..anyone at all who isn&rsquo;t non-white who voted for Obama?  Know any non-whites who even voted?</p>
<p>Farrakhan is fond of saying that before Obama was elected, he was selected.  But more and more, it is obvious to anyone who thinks on it that he was NOT elected.  He was selected&hellip;.and the election was rigged.  I mean more than usual.  White nationalists are used to the illusion of choice, with both candidates being two sides of the same anti-white coin.  But this is different&hellip;.a test case to see just how apathetic whites are.</p>

Perhaps your president should have even made some sort of token gesture at economising on his recent holiday(s), he can&rsquo;t go on printing money African style forever.</p>

		<p>Why this man is not fit to be president:</p>
<p>His actions spur caricaturization<br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/M2SYT" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/M2SYT</a></p>
<p>His policies spur contempt<br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/9gcoi" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/9gcoi</a></p>
<p>I would recommend muting the sound to Barack Flocka Flame as it&rsquo;s endless rap rhyming profanity is offensive but the visuals hit too close to the reality of this vacation to be ignored.</p>
<p>The second story is the reality of the macro depression and hyper inflation this nation faces when his policies come acropper of fiscal constraint.</p>
<p>When your lifestyle lends itself to such disparate comparisons of &#8216;what is understood&rsquo; vs. &#8216;what -continues- to be wrong&rsquo; as a function of intelligence about matters financial and appearances public, you can&rsquo;t pretend that a lack of political traction is due to racism or &#8216;inheritance&rsquo; of someone else&rsquo; problem.</p>
<p>The man simply doesn&rsquo;t have what it takes to make the decisions which betray his sponsors and contribute to the nations&rsquo; continuance.</p>
<p>For better or worse, Mr. Obama _is_ The President and he should have stepped up to the plate without excuses and with a work ethic that made &#8216;change&rsquo; not an acceleration towards the cliff edge but a reversing of course away from it.</p>
<p>He has not done so and _not_ being white invalidates everything he has said about &#8216;fixing other peoples&rsquo; problems&rsquo;.  He isn&rsquo;t Czar Nicholas, born to pomp and grandeur, he is simply acting openly as he once criticized whites for doing.</p>
<p>Being a spendthrift with other peoples&rsquo; money.</p>

		<p>I have personally seen the amount of security for the president,when Clinton stayed for a few days near where I live. His stay included some golf too. The logistics,cost and inconvenience to locals is staggering. I saw on the news that B.O. golfed 29 times last year. I&rsquo;m retired and didn&rsquo;t get on the links that often. He vacations while his administration bumbles away our future.He wants to come across like a bro. from the streets of Chicago when in fact he is more imperious than any president in recent memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you John! This may be the best description of this louse I&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of reading. You have magically captured the essence of this man with florid, yet relevant and succinct adjectives which are magical to the eyes and wondrous to the soul&hellip;. <br>
Bravo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I just wanted to say thank you back!</p>
<p>It is always good to get positive feedback here at AR about something I have written, and I am glad that you found my above post to be both insightful and even a bit humorous. This &ldquo;savoir&rdquo; in fools&rsquo; swaddle, has to be the biggest comedic tragedy since Bill Clinton decided to become the American Caligula, with full coverage in the tabloid press. George W. Bush, was not much better of course, but what is to be expected in this current multicultural circus made up only of clowns and untamed &ldquo;performance&rdquo; animals.</p>
<p>Each election cycle since 1992, has produced an adolescent boy as president, when the job requires a man. In 1992 and 1996, the only man running was Pat Buchannan, and of course he went nowhere. What a sad commentary on this country and its politics. </p>
<p>All the best to Anonymous#16,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>Well-intentioned? You mean, his intention in spending so much on vacations is to help America? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>In the article, it said he could have stayed on the base where Clinton did, to save money. Moochelle could have waited the extra few days instead of flying out early. He could buy property or stay with his wealthy friends, rather than renting top-of-the-line property. He could go to Camp David, as many presidents have.</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon. He&rsquo;s irresponsible and arrogant. He&rsquo;s just bright enough to know what he can get away with, and not much more. He believes he is so important that it is worth it to the country to<br>
spend any ridiculous amount he wants to spend.</p>
<p>Congress should set an amount in the budget for security and perhaps transportation for Obama&rsquo;s vacations, and he should pay for anything else himself. The vacations should not be on the average of one a month. We should not be responsible for Moochelle&rsquo;s vacations unless she is traveling with Obama. We did not elect her; she is not doing the country&rsquo;s business, and should not get &#8220;paid,&#8221; even if it is in travel costs.</p>
<p>No presidental posse should go along. It makes security more difficult and expensive. If you want to be president, visit with your friends in the White House for 4 years. If it isn&rsquo;t worth that, don&rsquo;t be president.<br>

		<p>&#8220;fresh outrage?&#8221;  This is the first I have heard of this story, thanks to the MSM. Obama is geting all the perks he can because he knows he may not win in 2012.</p>

You said &#8220;You will know that Africa has really come to America when comments such as the above start to attract the death penalty!&#8221;</p>
<p>If this was said outloud to some audiences here in the USA, they probably would attack, and not stop until we were dead. This is especially true of the far-left, politically correct, young white crowd, you know the type, the ones found on college campuses. So much for diversity of opinion!! And if this was said in a crowd of blacks, it would surely lead to violence. So much for freedom of speech! </p>
