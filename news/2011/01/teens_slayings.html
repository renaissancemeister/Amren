<h1>Teens&rsquo; Slayings: Race a Factor, Chief Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Janet Zimmerman, Press-Enterprise (Riverside, California), January 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As Redlands police continued to search Friday for the gunman who killed two teens and injured two others, community groups and churches rushed to quell racial tensions they fear may be stirred up by the shootings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Family and friends said the boys were not involved in gangs. One victim&rsquo;s mother said her son, who was black, had altercations with Latino gang members for several years.</p>
<p>Police Chief Jim Bueermann acknowledged race appears to be at least part of the motive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly don&rsquo;t want to sensationalize the racial component of this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it&rsquo;s absolutely part of the investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victims had a racially diverse group of friends, but there has been racial tension in the neighborhood, Bueermann said. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not have a race war erupting in this apartment complex, but there has been tension there between some Hispanic youth and some African-American youth,&#8221; he said. {snip}</p>
<p>Bueermann declined to discuss the victims&rsquo; backgrounds or whether gangs and drugs may have been factors in the violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the possible motives, he said, is retaliation for a videotaped fight that one of the dead teens, Quinn McCaleb, 17, had posted on MySpace, titled &#8220;Me vs. Sergio.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 20-second video shows a black male punching and kneeing a Latino teen inside what appears to be a public restroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&rsquo;t discounted it,&#8221; Bueermann said. &#8220;We think it&rsquo;s an important piece of potential evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCaleb&rsquo;s mother, Shanita Williams, said the fight occurred a year ago and, when it was over, the two boys shook hands and resolved their differences.</p>

<p>The authorities can play down the racial aspects of every situation, but racial attacks are getting worse and will continue to do so as blacks/Hispanics continue moving into areas adjacent to one another or into areas in which the races are supposedly &#8220;integrated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Multiculturalism simply doesn&rsquo;t work, and we&rsquo;re seeing the ongoing failure of it all.</p>
<p>Now that Asians and Middle Easterners are getting greater in number, fights with blacks are occurring more often.  Remember the report that Asians students were threatening to sue because of black violence against them?  Well, I think we&rsquo;ll see much more of that.</p>
<p>Diversity is what is making us weak.</p>

		<p>Racial clashes will get worse as the economy continues to fall. </p>
<p>Conflict among fractious groups has been a common occurrence throughout history.  The multicults childishly believe they can continue to tribalize as long as they institute sensitivity training and pass laws which they believe will curb inter-tribal clashes, but such thinking is truly the fantasy of fools, and the situation sits at a precipice, always, in danger of going over the edge at any given time.</p>
<p>We will see diversity fail miserably in our lifetimes.  It will occur sooner with a plummeting economy, but it will occur eventually without one.<br>
  </p>
<p></p>
<p>The society they have created so far throughout the West requires constant 24/7 pressure in order to prevent conflicts from arising.</p>

		<p>Hispanics are definitely pushing Blacks around all over Southern California in all areas. Similar racial/ethnic criminal struggles took place between Irish and Italians in places like New York and Chicago 100 years ago - the Italians came out on top.</p>
<p>Whites should just understand the sitution and make the best of things. Thus in Southern California there is now really no reason to pander to Blacks anymore or be in fear that Blacks will riot, cause lots of criminal trouble if they don&rsquo;t get their way as was the case in the 1960s, early 1990s.</p>
<p>If Blacks start making noises of trouble, rioting, crime - Hispanics would now put them in their place.</p>
<p>Racially aware Whites should consider forming ties with better Hispanics, tougher Hispanics who aren&rsquo;t scared of the Blacks, same thing that happened with Italians in places like Philly, Newark.</p>
<p>Financially successful, racially aware single, divorced White men in say their late 40s should consider taking a Hispanic wife and doing some networking. I&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;ll find we&rsquo;ve got some new options on dealing with the worst Black criminals, Black mau mau types.</p>
<p>Hey Jessie Jackson,, Sharpton, Bloods, Crips - you&rsquo;re time has come and gone</p>

<p>The current situation between blacks and hispanics in California in no way resmebles the mob wars in Chicago and New York 100 years ago.</p>
<p>And te Italians did not come out on top. They gradually fell by the wayside while the Irish mobs like Whitey Bulger&rsquo;s winter hill gang remained.</p>

<p>Not really.  Irish had already left most slum areas when the Italians were coming.  Italians tended to displace Jews who were already on their way out.  Irish and Italians tended to intermarry with each to a very high degree too.  <br>

Hispanics are definitely pushing Blacks around all over Southern California in all areas.</p>
<p>Jack you are so right.  My Los Angeles neighborhood has become one of the safest in the country in the last 15 years for just one reason, the Hispanics pushed the blacks out of Los Angeles.  The black predators used to use the freeways to terrorize White neighborhoods, no more, now they have to go through Hispanic neighborhoods to get to their White victims.</p>
<p>But the Hispanics have their defenses well organized and do not tolerate black predators.  So we Whites, forbidden to defend ourselves against black criminals by our anti White government benefit from the Hispanics.</p>
<p>The other immigrants help as well.  The small businesses always have friends and relatives hanging about as extra security when blacks come around as a result the blacks stay away from immigrant run businesses.</p>
<p>And best of all, the public schools are so much more civilized and safer for Whites now that the blacks have been pushed out by the Hispanics.</p>
<p>I have always maintained the reason the Los Angeles DA&rsquo;s office moved the OJ Simpson trial out of its jurisdiction to the blackest courthouse location so as to ensure 10 out of 12 black jurors was because the black politicians and their enablers like police commissioner Stanley Sheinbaum threatened another Rodney King style riot if OJ were convicted.</p>
<p>I noticed that it was after that disgusting blackmail by the blacks that both the city, county and state offices stopped hiring blacks and replaced them with affirmative action Hispanics.</p>
<p>In the OJ Simpson trial the blacks and their White Marxist enablers like Stanley Sheinbaum overplayed their hand with the result that they have been driven out of Los Angeles and will soon be driven out of the state by the Hispanics who are allowed by our government to defend themselves against black criminals.</p>
