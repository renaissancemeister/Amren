<h1>Roger Ebert Lambasted for Criticizing &#8216;Huckleberry Finn&rsquo; N-Word Deletion</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gather, January 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Roger Ebert  &mdash;  whose wife Charlie &#8220;Chaz&#8221; Hammel-Smith is African-American  &mdash;  caused a firestorm of controversy when he voiced his disapproval of the deletion of the N-word from a new edition of the classic American novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d rather be called a N***** than a Slave,&#8221; Roger Ebert tweeted in response to New South Publishing&rsquo;s announcement that the N-word, which appears in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn a total of 219 times, would be deleted form a new edition of Mark Twain&rsquo;s classic tale of life in the ante-bellum South.</p>
<p>Negative reactions to Roger Ebert&rsquo;s tweet were tweeted back to him fast and furiously. The messages aimed at Ebert ranged from constructive criticism describing Ebert as &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; and &#8220;ignorant,&#8221; to the mockingly hostile: &#8220;Fair point, from some1 who&rsquo;s likely to be called neither,&#8221; to the plain old hostile: R U OUT OF UR freakin head? jus cos ya wife is black dont give u the right to throw tht word around like its nothing. A*******.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, this is very true. I&rsquo;ll never be called a N***** or a Slave, so I should have shut the **** up,&#8221; Roger Ebert tweeted in his apology. After his last tweet, there has been no further comment from him or his reps.</p>

<p>That was a rather poor choice of phrases and it was easy to take him down for it.</p>
<p>As with Bill Clinton, whatever street cred you may have built up over the years, it all comes to naught if you disrespect the black man. When it comes to blacks, you can&rsquo;t win.<br>

		<p>Very tough call, but I would say would be sinful to be offended by the N-word.  If you are proud of who you are and what God made you (as one should be), any reference to that, no matter how derogatory the intent of the person using the term would be, should be a very pleasant reminder to you of that.</p>
<p>How come there is no offensive term for American (Yankee is not derogatory.)  Why is to be called a Kraut or a Jap non-offensive?  Because one can be proud to be German, Japanese, or American, and in all cases when a non-Ger/Jap/American tries to use such a term in an offensive manner, it would backfire because that person is only highlighting the fact that he/she is *not* a Ger/Jap/American.  If you&rsquo;re proud of who you are, *any* reference to that should make you happy.</p>

		<p>For comic relief, here&rsquo;s part of a goofy comment made to the original article:</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was riding my bike one night last winter, somebody called me the N word when they threw an object at me. I could have fallen on the icy snow, but mostly it scared the p*** out of me because I had been called the N word.</p>
<p>I am of Northern and Western European ancestry. Ebert is wrong when he says he&rsquo;ll never be called that word. How does he know the future? It hurts all the same, whether it&rsquo;s a mistake or not. &#8220;</p>

		<p>If people don&rsquo;t like the way the original version was written then they shouldn&rsquo;t read it. If people don&rsquo;t like the way the revised version is written then they shouldn&rsquo;t read it. It doesn&rsquo;t bother me. I&rsquo;m just glad people are sticking it to Roger Ebert.</p>

		<p>This is so typical of Whites and especially White liberals. You can decimate their countries, their culture, their gene pool and even their childrens&rsquo; future, but look out if somebody tries to touch famous literature, desecrate the flag, acts &#8220;unpatriotic&#8221;, or mistreats dogs.</p>
<p>Our people sure have got their priorities wrong. As Sam Dickson said, given maladaptive thinking like that, one has to wonder how it came to be that Whites were not destroyed a long time ago.</p>

		<p>Sometimes white people forget their place and screw up.we white people sometimes forget that the first amendment no longer applies us.  Roger Ebert forgot to censor himself but was quickly corrected and shown the error of his ways.  I think Roger will behave himself from now on.  With some intense sensitivity training all of us white people could really learn how to jump through the hoop, roll over and beg for forgiveness.  One day we white folks will really learn to love big brother.</p>

		<p>Forget Huck Finn; what about Blazing Saddles?  The funniest lines in that film include the N-word, spoken by a black actor. Not my personal favorite, but lots of folks think this is one of the best comedies ever.</p>
<p>(Also: Kudos to Ebert for carrying on with his career &amp; his life after losing his jaw to cancer.  That&rsquo;s a very courageous guy.)</p>

		<p>The N-word was never a polite phrase.  It was always derogatory and it was so for a reason.  Blacks often deserved the description.</p>
<p>Because -blacks- and their antics were considered an uncouth subject for common conversation anyway, the N-word was not spoken in formal conditions.  Lest we lower ourselves to their level.</p>
<p>If you want to understand how deep into our heads the current social engineering agenda is, what you have to understand is that Twain&rsquo;s _Huck Finn_ is a setup.  First it legitimizes the black man by making him seem harmless, funny &#8216;and a good friend&rsquo; _through false use of a name label_ (that is more rightly offensive and denigrative) in a manner that seems to declare the opposite (sticks and stones&hellip;).</p>
<p>NOW, having made the association of blacks as a behavior group with an ugly name as a &#8216;harmless thing&rsquo;, our mind benders seek to extract the name itself from common awareness.  Like a hoodoo man pulling the sickness from an afflicted person with a bit of sleight of hand and some raw chicken liver.</p>
<p>The problem, as everyone here should know, is that the behavior of blacks, in numbers, has not gotten any better.  It has become worse.  And without a name-association to label that common behavior, we are at extreme disadvantage in judging the threat that as a group, they present to the nation.</p>
<p>We are in fact being treated to negative inducement psychology to ignore that threat.</p>
<p>The key to understanding WHY this is is understanding how our intellect operates on a statistical weighting basis of bias.  See something bad enough, often enough, done by one particularly distinguishable person and you generally accept that the next such person you see will also have a higher probability of acting badly.</p>
<p>Blacks and Mexicans seem to operate on a wish fulfillment level where not -admitting- that they have done a bad thing is the same as not -doing it-, so long as they suffer no guilt or retribution for their acts.</p>
<p>And society would have you believe that this point of history less belief behavior is true, because &#8216;only individuals count&rsquo;, in the moment you meet them.</p>
<p>Which is simply not true.  For while individuals can only be held to a reckoning of their own actions.  Groups can be statistically labeled by their common traits and predilections.  And individuals seek power in groups.</p>
<p>We must not lose the ability to be prejudiced against the GROUP behavior of blacks.  And when we are disallowed the use of open code speak like the N-word to group those dangerous activities together, we are disallowed from considering the problem as a group vs. group outcome rather than of &#8216;individual&rsquo; faulting.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to use the N-word in polite company to know what it means.  And you should never forget that when blacks as individuals or as a group act like N-words _and know it_ because they use the word on themselves, it is to their statistically proveable, collective, behavior that you BOTH are referring.</p>

		<p>It was hilarious watching a CNN online film of a CNN panel discussing the issue.  They kept using the &#8220;N-word&#8221; to indicate the forbidden word and then tried to discuss how it not using it in the book was actually a disservice to blacks because they need to be reminded that using this word used to be considered normal and okay and black rage needs to be reminded/stimulated in each generation.</p>

		<p>This is moronic behavior all around. I think most of us are secure enough in our lives - at work and at home - that it makes no difference what someone calls us. If a group of blacks yells &#8220;cracker&#8221; or &#8220;redneck&#8221; or whatever at me - big deal. </p>
<p>Blacks do not like the word because it emphasizes and explains the behavior they are somehow unable to change. But don&rsquo;t worry - soon enough there will be a new word that over time will become evil and and on and on. </p>
<p>When you can&rsquo;t change the behavior, change the word.</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t blacks &#8220;bury&#8221; this word years ago?  How come we still hear it from them?  Ebert is an old man who has dodged death for the moment.  Just look at him.  Who would assume he still has his entire act together?  Can you imagine the fury if someone like Chris Rock said &#8220;I&rsquo;d rather be called a Cracker than a Honkey&#8221;.  Come to think of it, nothing would happen, Chris Rock&rsquo;s act has been all about Honkeys and Crackers for years.  Even Cosby gets no respect from blacks who wrote off his honest assessment of modern blacks as age-induced.  As little as I care about that word, I check myself any time I am compelled to say or type it to be certain the context will not violate a TOS rule or cause someone to go mindlessly violent and attack me.  Over 1 word.<br>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first such case. I remember the ending of &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221; being changed as well. Of course, this won&rsquo;t be the end of this type of thing. In the future, when kindle books replace actual books, it won&rsquo;t be just words that will be changed and books like Mark Twain&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t even exist anymore.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an old saying among older and wiser Black Americans; &#8220;Before I&rsquo;d be a slave I&rsquo;d be buried in my grave and go home to my Lord and be free.&#8221; Perhaps Mr. Ebert was comparing slavery to freedom and the fact that Jim was doing his best to escape slavery.<br>
The problem with the P.C. point of view is that if everything from the past is changed to reflect &rsquo;21st century&rsquo; attitudes then how can you measure progress?<br>

		<p>The sad fact is that all other successful racial and ethnic groups have long-since been desensitized to what used to be ethnic slurs.  I&rsquo;m Italian and laugh at guinea jokes, just as Poles laugh at Polack jokes, Jews laugh at Jew jokes, and the Irish chortle at Mick jokes.  We can laugh because we&rsquo;re totally assimilated into the broader culture.</p>
<p>Blacks, unfortunately, haven&rsquo;t been truly assimilated, and given the evidence of the past three hundred years, aren&rsquo;t likely to be any time soon.  </p>
<p>This nation was founded and settled by white Europeans, its culture created by people of European stock, and its standards in the arts, sciences, politics, and economics are creations of white Europeans. What&rsquo;s rather perverse and more than a little disconcerting is the tendency of many contemporary whites to want to apologize for all their ancestors have wrought and that their contemporaries continue to create.</p>
<p>The white European race seems to have a uniquely apologetic psychosis, despite being responsible for practically all the material, medical, inventive, industrial, philosophical, artistic, and political progress in modern history.</p>

		<p>So, are they going to remove the N-word from &#8220;Roots&#8221;?  It&rsquo;s used all over the place in that mini-series.  Somehow I doubt it.  Like Roots, Twain&rsquo;s book is about the evils of slavery, but perhaps it&rsquo;s use in Huckleberry Finn is just too subtle for the modern reader.  It can only only be uttered now by unsubtle, stereotypically evil characters.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Huckleberry Finn&#8221; is a work of literary genius. Mark Twain is one of our greatest American authors.  It&rsquo;s unbelievable to me that in our &#8220;politcally-correct&#8221; culture, it&rsquo;s become necessary to re-write great literature so as not to offend anyone&rsquo;s sensibilities.  I don&rsquo;t doubt that those whose feelings are injured by the &#8220;N&#8221; word (as used within a work of fiction written over a century ago), are not bothered in the least by &#8220;Jersey Shore&#8221; and &#8220;Family Guy&#8221;.  This is a blatant sign that our society is ill. </p>
