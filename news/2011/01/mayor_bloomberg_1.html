		<p><i>&#8220;48 were born in the Dominican Republic.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>But I can assure you that there are MANY more who were born here (doubtless to illegal alien parents), thus are citizens,  but who still consider themselves Dominicans at heart.</p>
<p>And note that Jamaican-borns are 12, and Ecuadorians have ten Guyana ten, Colombia eight. It&rsquo;s the same story there.</p>
<p>The special thing with Dominicans is that they were able to sneak into Puerto Rico and then come here where they could pass easily  for Puerto Ricans. (Puerto Ricans are automatic  US citizens and there are no entry requirements of any kind. Once you&rsquo;re in Puerto Rice, you&rsquo;re on US territory. You&rsquo;re here! You&rsquo;ve made it.) </p>
<p>Puerto Rico has been one of our weak spots &hellip; the chink in the dyke where the flood is pouring in.</p>

		<p>The NYPD is really quite a farce these days.  The &#8216;white&rsquo; guys are mostly big meat-headed southern european types (Italian mafioso type thugs) with a few drunken-looking Irish thrown in.  To a man (and to a dyke woman) they are generally rude, crude and cuss and curse like you won&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>The Asian cops look so out of place.  Can you imagine getting stopped on the freeway by some little korean or bangladeshi &#8216;trooper&rsquo;?  The west indians seem to have cornered the traffic violation and parking violation units.</p>
<p>The latino cops follow the crude patterns of the ethnic &#8216;whites&rsquo; and are often caught for petty corruption.  The black cops are mostly overweight, especially the female ones.  A lot of the black men have dreadlocks and look like something out of the movie predator.</p>
<p>I am sorry, but I do not know of anyone who has much respect for the &#8216;courtesy&rsquo;, &#8216;professionalism&rsquo; or &#8216;respect&rsquo; of the cops out here.  (That&rsquo;s their motto.)  They don&rsquo;t seem like a cohesive force as much as they seem like a collection of oddities thrown together.  Diversity is our strength!</p>

<p>No argument there! I am old enough to remember when the Department had height and weight standards. (Plus educational, ethical and moral standards too; ie. no one with a criminal record!) Back then, a policeman was tall, well built, and almost always a white man. No midgets. No fatties. There were some female officers, who were limited to certain roles - not patrol. This started changing in the &rsquo;70s. You started seeing women in patrol cars.</p>
<p>There were always blacks (a few), but no special concessions were made to them on account of race. As it should be!</p>
<p>Many Latinos could not meet the height requirements, and so those were among the first to go. </p>

<p>Ha!  I have seen black females so fat they could hardly waddle across the street! Are there NO standards left anymore in the police? I suppose that would be discriminating. Another EEO lawsuit.</p>
<p>Ah, but now we have the blessings of diversity!  Ain&rsquo;t it grand?</p>

Another installment of the Police Academy series, only this one is real.</p>
<p>I assume they all passed the same tests and were graded on the same scale and no &#8216;brownie&rsquo; points were given for being non-white.</p>

		<p>Imagine what some of the &#8216;old time&rsquo; cops are thinking!  I include in this group the black and hispanic officers who joined when the standards were the same for EVERYBODY.  </p>
<p>I agree with #3; police should have a physical presence.  Appearance commands respect!  Diversity at what cost?  Appeasement never satisfies the belligerent.  A police force WITHOUT standards is asking for trouble.</p>
<p>I heard someone once say that a police force reflects the society that it serves.  Well if that is true then Gotham is in a lot of trouble.  Bring back Batman.  Mind you the PC brigade will probably emasculate him as well.  </p>

		<p>This nonsense is what comes from using our police departments and military as petri dishes for social experiments. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very fascinating, no doubt, for the social engineers to play with. </p>
<p>But this is only made possible when we have the luxury of peace and plenty.</p>
<p>What happens when there&rsquo;s a real crisis and you desperately need help?  Take 9/11 for example. What do you do when you need someone to carry you down the fire escape, and a 4 ft. Bangla Deshi female shows up?</p>

		<p>This has been going on for 15 to 20 year&rsquo;s now and gets worse with each new class. The best example is for any normal person with decent eye sight to walk around Mid Town Manhattan between late Nov and early Jan every year. The sight of these buffon&rsquo;s and clown&rsquo;s dressed up in police unifrom&rsquo;s is enough to make one wretch. At one time creature&rsquo;s like this were hidden in the outlying precinct&rsquo;s far from the eye&rsquo;s of gawking tourist&rsquo;s. Now I guess they have just too many of them. The real brunt of this will probably be felt in the next ten year&rsquo;s or so when all or most of the current high ranking Cheif&rsquo;s will be gone and they will have to be replaced by this current crop of misfit&rsquo;s. Then the term New York&rsquo;s Finest will truly be a fraud and a lie.</p>

		<p>My mother grew up in the Bronx during the 1960s. She tells me how cops used to be tall, clean cut and wore respectable and tidy uniforms. The cops are the law and they set an example for the people they protect. Who is going to want to look at a cop with a sloppy uniform, cornrows and probably has an unprofessional attitude? Its ridiculous.</p>
