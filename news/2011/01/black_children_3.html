<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Contact: Walter Hoye, 510-557-7716; Ryan Bomberger, 757-535-7926; Dr. La Verne Tolbert, 323-216-2551, life@issues4life.org </p>
<p>LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12, 2011 /Christian Newswire/  &mdash;  The Issues4Life Foundation, in partnership with The Radiance Foundation, launches an abortion awareness and pro-adoption themed campaign, entitled &#8220;Endangered Species.&#8221; California is the nation&rsquo;s abortion capital with over 208,000 abortions (in the latest year reported) among its 424 abortion clinics. This African-American led initiative exposes Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s racist and eugenics-based history and unaltered course. According to the CDC, the black abortion rate is 3 times that of whites and 2 times that of all other races combined  &mdash;  differences which cannot be explained by &#8220;lack of access&#8221; or &#8220;health care disparities.&#8221; Seventy (70) billboards stating &#8220;Black Children Are An Endangered Species  &mdash;  TooManyAborted.Com&#8221; are placed throughout Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Walter B. Hoye II, President of the Issues4Life Foundation, an African-American leader committed to ending abortion, has raised awareness nationwide. &#8220;The impact of abortion in the African-American community is the Darfur of America,&#8221; Hoye declares citing the 50 million aborted since 1973, 18 million of which are African-American.</p>
<p>The Radiance Foundation&rsquo;s co-founder, Ryan Bomberger, is the Creator/Director of the TooManyAborted.com campaign and was, as a child, transracially adopted into a multi-racial family of 15. &#8220;Taxpayer-funded Planned Parenthood aborted 324,008 innocent lives and only made 2,405 adoption referrals according to their own latest Annual Report; that&rsquo;s 135 children killed for every 1 adoption referral,&#8221; Bomberger says. &#8220;Choice is a sham.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. La Verne Tolbert, PhD, a former Board Member of Planned Parenthood knows about the abortion chain&rsquo;s tactics. &#8220;In California, children are targeted for abortions through school-based clinics and school-linked clinics, which are family planning clinics on or near school grounds. Girls are taken off campus to a Planned Parenthood clinic, where abortions are performed without parental consent or notification.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Issues4life Foundation is a nonprofit organization, based in California, dedicated to protecting human life from our biological beginning until death and works directly with African-American leaders nationwide to strengthen their stand against abortion. </p>
<p>The Radiance Foundation is a nonprofit organization, based in Atlanta, that seeks to inspire people to live a life of meaning. Through various forms of media, speaking engagements, public awareness campaigns and community outreach efforts, they illuminate the intrinsic value each person possesses.</p>
<p>The Press conference will be held at 6146 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles CA 90035-2517, Saturday, January 15th, 2011 from 11:00 A.M. to 12:30 P.M.<br>

		<p> Seems to me like so many black fetuses are aborted because blacks get pregnant when they didn&rsquo;t intend to much more often than other races. Presumably no one drags these black pregnant women (often teenagers) to these abortion clinics; they choose to have it done.</p>
<p> And by the way: &#8220;Endangered species&#8221;? That&rsquo;s a laugh! They&rsquo;re not so &#8220;endangered&#8221; that they can&rsquo;t totally dominate professional sports in this country when they reach teen-age and beyond; or make up far more than their share of the prison population. African lions are an endangered species; African-Americans are not.</p>

		<p>They are not an endangered species in Haiti.  The birth rate in Haiti tripled in the past year from previous years (the increase is attributed to widespread Rape).  Same thing would have occurred in New Orleans if those people had remained in the Super Dome for a year.  For the same reason.</p>

		<p>Black children are not an endangered species.</p>
<p>First off, black children are not animals.  (As loath as we are to admit it, sometimes.)  The classification of &#8220;endangered species&#8221; or &#8220;threatened species&#8221; are for non-human lifeforms, legally speaking.</p>
<p>But putting that aside, black children aren&rsquo;t &#8220;endangered&#8221; because their population is not dwindling at all, much less at an &#8220;endangering&#8221; pace.</p>
<p>I know what will be said in other posts on this thread, and I want to nip it in the bud right now, with something I&rsquo;ve said on this medium several times before.</p>
<p>Imagine there are 10 people on Earth.  Assume all ten are of reproductive age and capability.  Round the human gestation period up to a full year, for the purposes of discussion.  Discount the possibility of twins, triplets, etc. for the same, assume all births are singles.</p>
<p>If those 10 people comprise 9 women and one man, there could be nine new people every year.  Meaning the census stands at 19 at the end of year one, 28 at the end of year two, 37 at the end of year three, ect.</p>
<p>If those 10 people comprise of the oppostite, 9 men and one woman, there can only be one new person every year.  The census will be 11 after year one, 12 after year two, 13 after year three, ect.</p>
<p>So the moral of the story is that the greater the percentage of a population that is women of reproductive age and capability, the higher the population growth rate can be, regardless of what men are doing to each other.  </p>
<p>Why do you think human societies have never really tolerated the idea of women engaging in active military combat?  </p>
<p>Even in violence-happy black Africa and black parts of the formerly white world, almost all black violence involves boys and men.</p>
<p>Humans are hard-wired against killing the incubators of our progeny.</p>
<p>The long and short of this is that black crime will not result in black auto-genocide.</p>

		<p>Wow, even I&rsquo;ve never claimed blacks are a separate species (Yes, I know it&rsquo;s metaphorical).<br>
But &#8220;endangered&#8221;? Please. Blacks are growing in absolute numbers in this country. They&rsquo;re hardly &#8220;endangered&#8221; here, unlike whites, who have dropped below replacement fertility and are becoming increasingly surrounded by hostile races. And there are plenty of blacks in Africa, the Caribbean, South America, and even Europe should the unthinkable happen and all US blacks disappear. Why must (mostly white Christian) pro-lifers engage in such hysterics? Do they really think that it would do the world any good to have more low-IQ, crime-prone individuals?</p>

		<p>When I first saw the pictures, I smirked that atleast they acknowledge blacks as a different species. In all seriousness though, if any race is an endangered species at this time it&rsquo;s whites. Blacks will account for 2 billion people alone in a few decades, most of them living in poverty in Africa. That said, I fail to see how posting this billboard in L.A. will accomplish anything, the biggest threat to blacks in America at this time are Hispanics. The same Hispanics who make up the majority of L.A.&rsquo;s population.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black children are an endangered species&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>I have to ask, then&hellip;</p>
<p>- Does this mean that Asian, Latino and White children can now go to school, focus on their work, have a productive learning experience and grow to be successful members of society? </p>
<p>- Does this also mean that those same Asian, Latino and White kids can now go to a safe school without being picked on, having their belongings stolen, getting stabbed in the cafeteria or dodging bullets in the parking lot?</p>
<p>- Does this mean that Teachers can finally TEACH, instead of being glorified babysitters in a Romper Room? </p>
<p>- Does this mean that Teachers can actually get down to teaching Math, Science and Language Arts without being bogged down by &#8220;black history month&#8221; and feel-good lessons about black culture?</p>
<p>- Does this mean that Teachers no longer have to lie about those mythological figures called &#8220;Great Black Inventors&#8221; and &#8220;Black Heroes&#8221;? </p>
<p>- Does this mean that student test scores are going to rise and that America&rsquo;s public school system will once again be noted for it&rsquo;s effectiveness and service to society?</p>
<p>We can only dream about these things, unfortunately. </p>

		<p>Black children becoming an endangered species?  The fault of white racism and something that needs to be taken care of urgently.  White children becoming an endangered species?  Well, that&rsquo;s just racist conspiracy and, even if that were true, the world is better off without whites since they are evil, racist, oppressive, greedy, etc.  </p>

		<p>Every year blacks increase their percentage of the population.  Every year whites see their percentage decrease.  So we know who&rsquo;s really endangered.  Yes, a higher percentage of black children are aborted.  Yes, blacks have a higher rate of infant mortality.  Yes, black children and teenagers have a much higher chance of getting killed than white children do (by other blacks, of course).  But blacks have a high enough fertility rate that it overcomes all those negative factors easily.  You&rsquo;re seeing the power of an r-strategy at work.</p>

		<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to thank all my white brothers and sisters for their intelligent comments.  (What&rsquo;s race but extended family?)</p>
<p>Second, if black children really were an endangered species,then countries like Haiti wouldn&rsquo;t have a fertility rate around 4 when parents there are unable even to take care of one child.</p>

		<p>Absolute hogwash!  Africa&rsquo;s population is now over a billion and still growing rapidly enough to be expected to double again in the next 40 years.  There are 40 million blacks in America, 10 million more in Haiti, (never mind the rest of the Caribbean, and Brazil&rsquo;s 12 million blacks - as for Brazil&rsquo;s 76 million mulatto&hellip;  well, is our president black?)  There are millions more in Europe, but since France won&rsquo;t count them, we can only guess at the total numbers. </p>
<p>In short, there are already far more blacks than whites, and their numbers are increasing.</p>
<p>White babies, on the other hand, actually are so few in number that their numbers  are both well below replacement level and about to be eclipsed by non-white babies right here in the U.S.A., right now.  <br>
Furthermore, the potential for more white babies to be born is plummeting as the majority of the white population ages beyond the possibility of child-bearing.</p>
<p>The majority of the approximately 1.3 million annual abortions in the USA are of white babies. At the same time we take in 1.8 million immigrants per year (see: <a href="/pubs/FS16_USImmigration_051807.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/FS16_USImmigration_051807.pdf</a> ), at least 85% of whom are not white.   We are quite literally participating in a system in which white babies are killed by the million, and replaced by non-white aliens.   That&rsquo;s genocide.   On an unprecedented scale.   It is also largely self-inflicted, which is also unprecedented.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, though the total population of whites is smaller than that of blacks, the labor of whites (when they can get work, rather than be replaced or rejected outright in the name of affirmative action and diversity, i.e.: get rid of whitey) <br>
is confiscated by government force (and street thugs, car thieves, and home invaders&hellip;) and given to blacks.  The majority of black babies are born on the taxpayer&rsquo;s dime (whitey&rsquo;s dollar), even while most whites are concerned about being able to afford their own babies, and being encouraged to have either have none or fewer to &#8220;save the planet&#8221; (as though white babies were an apocalyptic plague), or to end &#8220;racism&#8221; by having non-white babies like our president&rsquo;s mother did. <br>
(More accurately, that&rsquo;s: &#8220;cut off your line, help end the white race&#8221;, but of course that&rsquo;s obvious.) </p>
<p>It is white babies, not black,  who are endangered.   <br>

		<p>Sorry, but with the white race in decline all over the world, and with the black race worldwide on the increase, I can&rsquo;t really feel any sympathy for the blacks.  The white race is the only race in danger of dying out.  In addition: the races are not equal.  It is the white race that is responsible for virtually all inventions and for civilization itself, while the black race is a parasite that owes whatever civilization it has to the positive influence of the white race.  Left to their devices, black descend into barbarity.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p><i>Girls are taken off campus to a Planned Parenthood clinic, where abortions are performed without parental consent or notification.</i></p>
<p>Strange as this may seem to some, it is the California state law:  Girls 14 and over may leave the campus to obtain an abortion or birth control without parental consent.   For this reason alone <i>and no other</i> may students leave campus without notification of parent.</p>
<p>We teachers are counseled of this every year at the very first teachers&rsquo; meeting, given paperwork which notifies and warns us of this law (I keep a copy in my desk).  Of course, as the article stated, some (taxpayer) funded clinics are on school grounds these days - for birth control products and pregnancy tests but not abortion.  We are also not allowed to notify a girl&rsquo;s parents if she is pregnant (due to &#8216;privacy&rsquo; laws I assume).</p>
<p>What most concerns me about this push for black women not to abort their babies is this: Who will take care of babies that are unwanted?  (Yeah, I know, someone will tell me, stupid White liberals (DWLs).</p>
<p><i>In the early 1990s the racial differences became even greater, with blacks having four-and-a-half times the infant homicide rate of whites and Hispanics.</i></p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p><i>Of the estimated 500,000 children in the U.S. foster home system, more than half are minorities. Of those available for adoption, 40 percent are black&hellip;of so-called hard-to-place children, about 67 percent of such children are black and 26 percent are white, while 67 percent of the waiting families are white and 31 percent are black.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/68goy9w" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/68goy9w</a></p>
<p>Are these numbers we want to increase?  Shouldn&rsquo;t every child be loved and wanted?  BTW: I am not pro-abortion, I am pro-birth control, mandatory in come cases as is necessary.</p>
<p>But, as it stands now, with the likes of bilary clinton, et.al. the government is a better parent than the likes of you and the best place to raise children is in government day care.</p>

		<p>Blacks, worldwide, are an endangered species  &mdash;  and not because of high abortion rates.  When blacks are in charge in cities or countries, death rates from disease, malnutrition, murder, and war vastly increase.  In the not-too-distant future, the West will no longer have the financial resources to keep black Africa and Haiti afloat, and black-dominated Western cities will sink further into the abyss.  </p>

<p> Hasn&rsquo;t anyone listened to these so-called Christian conservative pastors and the seminaries they sprouted from? Adopt all these African children is their main topic and help Haiti, Africa, etc. They also bless interracial marriages (as long as they are both &#8220;Christians&#8221;). They denounce any White Christian that they consider &#8220;racist&#8221;&hellip;The Church has become nothing but a multi-racial, one world order organization. </p>

<p>No, blacks are NOT an endangered species. WHITES worldwide ARE! This has been OUR enemies plan for eons and it is coming to fruition. Just look at the birthrates alone and that will tell you this fact. It does not matter one iota how many black children die, they just replace them faster with our help. When nonwhites make up 92% of the world, how can any thinking person believe that Whites have not been targeted for extinction?  </p>
<p>As for sinking into the abyss, it is the White race not the black race. It is the White race being led to genocide, not the black race or any other race. </p>

&#8220;Why do you think human societies have never really tolerated the idea of women engaging in active military combat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t have as much strength and stamina as the men, and numerous battlefield rapes would occur by their own troops, to mention nothing of their natural less aggressiveness than men, although there are infinitely more reasons, l;ike a lack of ruggedness, etc.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to criticize your post in its entirety.  I agree with the rest of it, as I do with many of your comments, but after all the injustices we in the military had to swallow when our ranks were inundated with women I can&rsquo;t let that pass.</p>
<p>Some poositions for women are o.k.  But to the extent the PC parade at the Pentagon have inundated our ranks with them smacks of political correctness gone amuck, just as unqualified blacks being awarded positions in the officer&rsquo;s corps has.  Both will result in many unnecessary deaths in future combat with armies that are rapidly catching up with the US on aerial power and heavy armaments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Black children are not an endangered species.</p>
<p>First off, black children are not animals. (As loath as we are to admit it, sometimes.) The classification of &ldquo;endangered species&rdquo; or &ldquo;threatened species&rdquo; are for non-human lifeforms, legally speaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may have hit upon something here, inadvertently.  But first off, let&rsquo;s clear up what the word &#8220;animal&#8221; means.  Unless you are denying biological science altogether as well as linguistics, this is the definition as copied from Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&#8220;The word &#8220;animal&#8221; comes from the Latin word animalis (meaning with soul, from anima, soul). In everyday colloquial usage, the word usually refers to non-human animals.[1] Frequently, only closer relatives of humans such as mammals and other vertebrates are meant in colloquial use.[2] The biological definition of the word refers to all members of the kingdom Animalia, encompassing creatures as diverse as sponges, jellyfish, insects and humans.[3]&#8221;</p>
<p>So if the word &#8220;animal&#8221; can be used colloquially to not include humans, contrary to its actual meaning, then the use of &#8220;species&#8221; is acceptable as well.</p>
<p>I do not know if your definition of the use of &#8220;endangered species&#8221; is correct as a stricture of the legal tome, but consider what this means to those of us who wish to preserve the white race.  As I understand it, the colloquial non-sue of &#8220;animal&#8221; by Westerners comes from religion, specifically, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, all three seeing humans as special, a special created class, subsequently given stewardship (dominion) over the rest of life.  Such a cultural mindset may well work against the arugments for white racial preservation.  If no race or ethnicity can be LEGALLY considered as an endangered species legally, this represents a roadblock to a potentially useful legal path that could be used to preserve whites.  This may be why land ownership rights of Amerinds was the legal path used in establishing the prolific Native American Reservation systems in the U.S.  By such means, no white can claim indigenous ownership anywhere except in Europe.  Such claims ought to be pursued by nationalist groups like the BNP and if they do, ought to be supported (financially) by all concerned whites everywhere. But unless we start to use endangered species to identify white population collapse, the indigenous land ownership rights will probably not get far either.</p>

<p>I do not agree with your assessment.  But I would agree that as right goes further right and left goes further left, they begin to resemble one another, in some ways, especially in the tendency to become totalitarian.</p>
<p>I am FOR ABORTION because it reduces the non-white population the most.  I also would bet that most white females who have abortions are aborting non-white babies.  That&rsquo;s just a guess, but I think it is likely true.</p>
<p>The right has resisted the right to abortion historically NOT because their Christian heart of compassion is hurt when they hear of another pregnancy terminated, but because Roe V. Wade was championed by the Feminist Movement and NOW.  The right tardily came up with the phrase &#8220;pro-life&#8221; after the Feminists had long been calling their political movement &#8220;pro-choice.&#8221;  Men didn&rsquo;t like all the things the new Feminist Movement was doing in America and this was an identifiable battle ground for them, using Christianity as their cover.  What gives the anti-abortion movement away is that same general groups resistance to supporting the lives they insist must be preserved in the female womb.  Typically, the anti-abortion, Bible thumping Christian Conservative politically fights support for poor and unmarried women that they want to force to have babies, and don&rsquo;t want to pay for schools to educate them.  We all end up having to support more and bigger jails, which produces more of a crime culture.</p>
<p>What we need is quality, not quantity.  I am for reward programs for poor women and especially non-whites the world over, who will not only have abortions, but consider sterility after two abortions or two children.  Otherwise you can count on the world subsiding sooner than later, due to an overabundance of unwashed, uneducated, human baby makers.</p>

<p>Plus, how is that workable today, after years of rising black illegitimacy, when the majority of black men probably have children by at least two women. Even if these men had the ability to support their children (I doubt most of them do), and even if their evoluationarily ingrained behavior could be reversed, and even if they could be persuaded to give up the entitlement mentality that treats all their failures as the faults of whites and that treats all white criticisms of blacks as &#8220;racism&#8221;, how can anything like a healthy nuclear family structure be established in such an environment? Does the man travel between the homes of his two &#8220;baby-mamas&#8221;? And I haven&rsquo;t even started on the costs of genetic testing to prove paternity&hellip;</p>

		<p>Widespread acceptance of abortion reveals an extreme moral bankruptcy in our society.  Abortion is a violation of natural law that leftists attempt to explain away by saying a fetus is not a person, so enjoys no natural right to life, which is rooted in centuries of property rights law.  </p>
<p>Coerced taxation under the implicit threat of violence in order to subsidize poor decision-making and lack of planning by some people is also a gross violation of property rights.  </p>
<p>To oppose both things is not only consistent but essential to the protection of true liberty from those who would ask us to trade some of our freedom for their offers of security and planning our lives for us.  For if history teaches us anything, it&rsquo;s that these folks can never exert enough control over our lives.  Look around you if you don&rsquo;t believe me.  It&rsquo;s happening before your eyes.   </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;poor and unmarried women that they want to force to have babies, and don&rsquo;t want to pay for schools to educate them. We all end up having to support more and bigger jails, which produces more of a crime culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your socialist welfare schemes that contribute to the growth of this class of people outside the natural carrying capacity of society, as is dictated by economics (an indecipherable language to socialists), specifically the fact that subsidy begets more subsidy because it results in growth of the subsidized object, in this case the parasite classes.  It&rsquo;s a bubble, just like housing, healthcare, education, and all other things grossly distorted by false signals created by government intervention.  </p>
<p>Your solution is not to remove the subsidy but to turn knobs and cranks in an effort to fine-tune the output, to treat the symptoms rather than the disease, oblivious to the fact that it&rsquo;s your efforts to overcome the natural order that exacerbate if not outright create the problem in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we need is quality, not quantity. I am for reward programs for poor women and especially non-whites the world over, who will not only have abortions, but consider sterility after two abortions or two children. Otherwise you can count on the world subsiding sooner than later, due to an overabundance of unwashed, uneducated, human baby makers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course you will be the arbiter of what constitutes a &#8220;quality&#8221; person in your socially-engineered utopia, correct?  And after your breakfast, Mein Fuhrer, will you kill the sickly and dense at lunch and then the elderly at dinner?</p>
<p>The arguments of the lamented &#8220;Christian right&#8221; are indeed logical and follow centuries of legal and moral tradition that frustrate the best efforts of the &#8220;best and brightest&#8221; social engineers to wipe them away.</p>
<p>The most dangerous people on the face of the planet are those who claim to know the path for us all, and will lead us into the light if only we follow their enlightened direction, paid subscribers or no.  There are tens of millions of dead Jews, Ukrainians, and Chinese who could testify to this if they still had a pulse.  </p>
<p>Frankly I want to keep the non-whites around.  Without them the white man will just turn on his brother.  If you don&rsquo;t believe me pay attention to the comments section the next time an article calls out a specific white nationality like Italians or Germans.</p>

Poster no 32 – a very good comment that shows the answer, but Youngwhiteguy or Poster 31: You are rite in a way that got me thinking. They are a separate race not a species, but what is the implication for white people if they are indeed seeing themselves this way, while whites are not even allowed to think of themselves as a separate race? I mean it is one thing for a group to forgo ethno centrism while the &#8220;other&#8221; keeps it, it is a completely different playing field when one group forgo it, while the &#8220;other&#8221; views them as sub-human.</p>

 <br>
First of all, and most obviously, I have read quite a few articles here about the biological reasons for differences in average intelligence, personality, and character between blacks, whites, and Orientals. <br>
 <br>
Second in 1965 when Daniel Patrick Moynihan was called a &#8220;racist&#8221; for drawing attention to it, the black rate of illegitimacy was 20 percent. Black illegitimacy has gone up since then. So has white illegitimacy. Blacks will always have a higher rate of illegitimacy than whites.  It does not have to be as high as it is now.  <br>
 <br>
Human nature is not infinitely malleable, but it can be shaped by changes in government policies and social mores. We need to get back to the idea that, &#8220;Love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage.&#8221;  <br>

		<p>I agree with Engelman on this point. There is indeed improvement to be made with regards to black (and white, for that matter) sexual behavior. Obviously disparities between the two races can never be fully eliminated, but eliminating the policies and social attitudes that have greatly spiked the sexual misbehavior of the American black will go a long way to helping them. One can improve lives without making them equal or perfecting them. The statistics are available in Charles Murray&rsquo;s Losing Ground.</p>

		<p>There has been a lot of aborticide talk in this thread and several previous ones, and I wanted to chime in with my political compromise on the issue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pro-life, and personally, I am on the extreme of the issue   &mdash;   Aborticide is the sake kind of violence as rape and incest, and therefore, if it were up to me and me alone, the only exception would be life of the mother.  </p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s not up to me.  The main reason why there will always be some form of legal aborticide is because of wealthy women, especially wealthy neo-liberal Republican women.  They&rsquo;ll circle the wagons if there is any serious legs to undoing Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>My compromise solution is that first trimester aborticides should be allowed for any reason, construed as part of the 4th Amendment right to privacy and incorporated onto the states through the 14th Amendment.  Second and third trimester aborticides for good cause, i.e. rape, incest, life of the mother, should be the same way   &mdash;   Construed as part of the 4th and incorporated into the 14th.  Convenience aborticides in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters should be left up to state option.  Some states won&rsquo;t allow any in any circumstances in which they would have latitude, some would allow all in all cases, and some would allow some in some cases.</p>
<p>There would be other issues to iron out within this spirit of compromise   &mdash;   Paternal rights, partial birth aborticides, FACES issues (i.e. police protection of aborticide mills), and so on.  However, I really wish some sort of compromise could be reached, because I&rsquo;m getting tired of the issue, and every argument that could ever be made for and against it, has already been made.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that&rsquo;s sorta my position on the illicit drug issue   &mdash;   The DEA classifies drugs based on schedules.  There should be some line of demarcation in the schedules   &mdash;   A &#8220;more&#8221; dangerous drug should be under exclusive Federal jurisdiction, a &#8220;less&#8221; dangerous one should be left to state option whether it should be illegal or not.  After what happened a week ago, though, I think marijuana should be bumped up in schedule classification.</p>
