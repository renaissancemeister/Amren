<h1>School Board Member Broadcasting Attack on MLK Jr.: Man Owns Radio Station</h1>
 

<p>Deb Stanley, KMGH-TV (Denver), January 10, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>A member of the Greeley-Evans School District 6 Board of Education is broadcasting an attack on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on his radio station.</p>
<p>Brett Reese reads a listener&rsquo;s letter on 104.7 FM Pirate radio that calls the slain civil rights leader a sexual degenerate, a communist and modern-day plastic god.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a sexual degenerate, an America hating communist and a criminal betrayer of even the interest of his own people,&#8221; Reese says in his radio broadcast.</p>
<p>&#8220;His name isn&rsquo;t really Martin Luther King Jr.,&#8221; Reese continues.</p>
<p>When asked if this was an appropriate broadcast for a school board member, Reese responds, &#8220;It&rsquo;s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know what? That&rsquo;s a good question.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reese said this particular broadcast has been on the air for three years, but recently it&rsquo;s being broadcast twice a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess, personally, I believe in the message, the general message of what this letter is about,&#8221; Reese said.</p>
<p>Parents in his school district are embarrassed by his broadcast.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The parents 7NEWS spoke with want Reese to resign.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has no business being on the board of education in a town with a huge Hispanic population,&#8221; said Jones.</p>
<p>Reese said he&rsquo;s not going to step down. He will continue broadcasting that commentary every day up to the MLK holiday on Jan. 17.</p>
<p>On Monday night, Reese walked out of a school board meeting after the board agreed on a resolution acknowledging Reese&rsquo;s right to free speech, but decrying his message.</p>
