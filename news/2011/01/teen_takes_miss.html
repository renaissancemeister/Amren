			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sydney Morning Herald, January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 17-year-old Nebraskan too young to cast a ballot has captured enough votes to win the Miss America crown, kickstarting her hopes of going to law school and eventually becoming a politician.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be there making sure that I stand up for what&rsquo;s right, stand up for integrity and honesty,&#8221; Teresa Scanlan said after becoming the first Miss America from Nebraska.</p>
<p>She won a $US50,000 ($50,340) scholarship and a year&rsquo;s reign in one of the most visible positions any young woman could seek.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the youngest Miss America since the pageant implemented age limits in 1938. Rosemary LaPlanche was runner-up in 1940 and easily won the crown in 1941 despite being one month too young to compete, according to the pageant&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>Scanlan captured the hearts of seven judges after a night of playing the piano, walking across a Las Vegas stage in a white gown and black bikini, and saying security trumps the public&rsquo;s right to knowledge when it comes to government leaks.</p>
<p>She said she will register to vote as an independent after turning 18 next month, and work toward her goals by going to law school and perhaps becoming a prosecutor, then judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point, attorneys and politicians are looked down on and have terrible reputations for being greedy and power hungry and I really think it&rsquo;s important for people who have their heart and mind in the right place get into those powerful positions,&#8221; Scanlan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I talk to kids my age, I don&rsquo;t find very many who are interested in that, because many are just turned off to the idea,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s important that we get a lot more of my generation willing to step up and go into those positions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scanlan beat out 52 beauty queens from other US states, plus Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia. She said she was a bit worried after a preliminary interview with judges and hoped they would think a 17-year-old could do the job.</p>
<p>Clearly, they did.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I never passed up a cookie on my journey here,&#8221; Scanlan said.</p>
<p>Scanlan said age didn&rsquo;t matter as the pageant celebrated its 90th birthday, though she thought her age might have made her an underdog.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were on an even playing field,&#8221; she said. &#8220;From 17 to 24, that can be a huge age range. But with these girls, they are all at the highest level imaginable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Arkansas Alyse Eady won $US25,000 as first runner-up, while Miss Hawaii Jalee Fuselier won $US20,000 for third place.</p>
<p>Scanlan, a recent high school graduate from the western Nebraska town of Gering, planned to study American politics at Patrick Henry College in Virginia after her reign as Miss America. Scanlan said she planned to defer her university enrollment until she finishes her reign with the crown.</p>
<p>During the nationally televised pageant, Scanlan answered a question about WikiLeaks by saying the United States should focus on security first.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know when it came to that situation, it was actually based on espionage, and when it comes to the security of our nation, we have to focus on security first and then people&rsquo;s right to know, because it&rsquo;s so important that everybody who&rsquo;s in our borders is safe and so we can&rsquo;t let things like that happen, and they must be handled properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scanlan said the question was easier for her than a generic one, because she has routinely discussed current events with her family since she was young.</p>

		<p>&#8220;New Miss America is white.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe they let this one slip by without interjecting race into the equation and disengenuously declaring a non-white the victor, even though the non-whites they select look like whites with tans.</p>
<p>I wonder if hundreds of so-called &#8220;journalists&#8221; put their feet through the T.V. screen when the winner was announced.  Will they now go after the winner declaring her to be racist, hoping to get the results overturned? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure a large number of blacks will be screaming racism, although their winners don&rsquo;t even come close to looking black, as far as their features and bone structure are concerned.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s refreshing to see an apparently heterosexual girl of the Caucasian persuasion who doesn&rsquo;t have a physical deformity win this pageant.  Really, though, what does this story have to do with AmRen?</p>
<p>I might add the Miss America pageant in recent years has suffered from a dearth of viewers.  Entertainment Weekly magazine reported last year that between 1991 and 2009 it lost almost 87% of its viewing audience!  As a result, it has had trouble securing network coverage.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2010/01/30/Ratings-for-Miss-America-pageant-eroding/UPI-61831264879364/" rel="nofollow">https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2010/01/30/Ratings-for-Miss-America-pageant-eroding/UPI-61831264879364/</a></p>
<p>I blame the declining ratings (in part) on the fact in recent decades the Miss America Pageant has veered away from its originally stated goal of showcasing the &#8220;ideal of American womanhood&#8221; and instead ramming unattractive non-Whites and other assorted riff raff down our collective throats in the name of &#8220;p.c.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been reported this year&rsquo;s pageant had 47% more viewers than last year&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/jan/17/2011-miss-america-pageant-ratings-increase-47-abc-/" rel="nofollow">https://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/jan/17/2011-miss-america-pageant-ratings-increase-47-abc-/</a></p>
<p>It remains to be seen if this is a reverse in the trend or (as I suspect) just a blip.  In either case I stopped watching the Miss America Pageant back in 1984 when officials obviously rigged the event to insure a black was the winner and first runner-up.  The debacle that followed was hardly surprising and well-deserved.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go back, either.</p>

		<p>Speaking of WikiLeaks, which Miss Scanlan brings up   &mdash;   We had the news today that Assange and Co. are going to start spilling the beans on heretofore &#8220;secret&#8221; and &#8220;confidential&#8221; Swiss bank accounts held by the world&rsquo;s richest individuals, including many Americans.  If that isn&rsquo;t more circumstantial evidence that Obama was behind the first round of WikiLeaks, and why the DOJ will do nothing to Assange, then nothing is.  For it&rsquo;s Obama who wanted to pry open Swiss banking confidentiality laws through most of 2009.</p>

		<p>I was actually surprised a white girl was chosen.  We&rsquo;ve had such a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; group of winners in the recent past.  Of course, this year&rsquo;s winner was only because there were more white judges.  When the judges are more &#8216;diverse&rsquo; the white girls have no chance.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s better than thinking viewership is down because of gays which was what I was thinking. My second thought was viewership is way down because of online porn.</p>

		<p>Several years ago a cousin of mine was up for the state pageant that would have led to the Miss America pageant.  She was first runner-up&hellip;lost to an Asian.  </p>
<p>Last time I watched the Miss America pageant, when they got down to the five semi-finalists, only one, Miss California, was White.  Gee, do Whites make up only one-fifth of the population now?  Then Miss California was the first of the five to be eliminated, leaving four nonwhites.  I shut off the TV and haven&rsquo;t watched it since.    </p>
<p>By the way, I found the tagline on this article, &#8220;Miss America is White,&#8221; very sad.  We&rsquo;re now reduced to noting or celebrating that Miss America is White.</p>

		<p>Beauty pageants have been losing integrity for years now. Even when the finalists are narrowed down to only white women, I have to stop watching because I see beautiful, feminine women from more conservative parts of the country, turned down in place of less attractive women from more leftist areas who are usually picked just because of some goofy soap box viewpoints they have that appeal to our media. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember whether it was Miss USA or Miss America, but I was watching one of those, years ago, and it came down to two women. One woman was feminine and delicate looking, kind of like a real life doll in many ways. She was a Southern girl from South Carolina, and she was charming, and sweet. She was very beautiful. It came down to her and a taller, more masculine, liberated woman from Illinois, who was less appealing. Miss Illinois ended up winning.</p>
<p>There was another year (it was right after 911), when Miss New York was kept in the running down to the final three or four when she should have been eliminated much sooner. They kept playing up the New York City tragedy whenever she would come on stage it seemed.  She didn&rsquo;t end up winning, but she shouldn&rsquo;t have been in the final four.</p>
<p>I personally think that if men were in charge of beauty pageants (heterosexual men), we wouldn&rsquo;t see this garbage. Men would choose based on beauty alone, instead of handicaps that make the judges feel sorry for the contestants or something else that gives the contestants victim status in their eyes.</p>
<p>I have personally been disgusted in recent years, because the contestansts chosen to represent Alabama are quite average and unappealing to me. Meanwhile, there are so many beautiful women in this state, but yet they don&rsquo;t get picked to represent.</p>
<p>I will be curious to see what happens with the Miss USA pageant, since that is the one that determines who gets picked to represent our country in Miss Universe, not the Miss America pageant.</p>

<p>Actually, this is not rtue. I was doing some research on the Miss America Pageant. The fact is since 1985, the vast majority of winners have hailed from either the south or midwest. In fact, Sharlene Wells, Miss Utah (1985), Carolyn Sapp Miss Hawaii (1992), Anglea Perez Baraquia, Miss Hawaii (2001), Katie Harmon, Miss Oregon (2002) have been the only non-southerners or midwestern pageant winners. In fact, only one New England contetant has ever won the crown, Miss Connecticut, the late Marion Bergeron, Miss Ameria 1933. She was 15. </p>
<p>Thus this demonstrates that the pageant is an overwhelimingly, rural, small town, conservative oriented competition. There is nothing wrong with this, but the fact that some of you are attempting to paint the Miss America Pageant as a &#8220;radical, leftist, urban &#8221; event are incorrect. </p>
<p>Its rival pageant, Miss USA, ran by Donald Trump is a sex obsessed and urban oriented as you can get.   </p>

		<p>June, I agree, but that is why I specified that I couldn&rsquo;t remember if those were Miss USA or Miss America pageants. I haven&rsquo;t been watching too many of those in recent years, and the fact that the few that I DID happen to watch turned out as I say above, says something. And I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned the other ones I watched where a minority of some sort got picked. I just think pageants in general have lost integrity. I guess I should have done my research on the Miss America pageant inparticular, but what I have seen in general with pageants at the state, national, and global level, is that other &#8220;attributes&#8221; are chosen over beauty, and I don&rsquo;t think that would be happening if heterosexual males made up all the judges.</p>
