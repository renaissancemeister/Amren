			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Klein, Philadelphia Inquirer, January 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal jury will be asked to decide whether it is acceptable for an African American person, but not a white person, to use the &#8220;n&#8221; word in a workplace.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge R. Barclay Surrick has ruled that former Fox29 reporter-anchor Tom Burlington&rsquo;s lawsuit against the station, claiming a double standard and alleging that he was the victim of racial discrimination, may go to trial. However, Surrick denied Burlington&rsquo;s claim of a hostile work environment.</p>
<p>Burlington, who is white, was fired after using the &#8220;n&#8221; word during a June 2007 staff meeting at which reporters and producers were discussing reporter Robin Taylor&rsquo;s story about the symbolic burial of the word by the Philadelphia Youth Council of the NAACP.</p>
<p>Burlington, who began work at the station in 2004 and is now working as a real estate agent, was suspended within days and fired after an account of the incident was published in the Philadelphia Daily News. He alleges that he &#8220;was discriminated against because of his race,&#8221; according to court documents. He claims in his lawsuit that at least two African American employees at Fox29 had used the word in the workplace and were not disciplined.</p>
<p>The dispute began after Taylor, who is white, used the phrase the &#8220;n&#8221; word during the 2007 staff meeting. She said participants at the burial had said the full word &#8220;at least a hundred times or more,&#8221; according to court records.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does this mean we can finally say the word n-?&#8221; Burlington asked colleagues, according to depositions.</p>
<p>Nicole Wolfe, a producer and one of the three African American employees among the nine people at the meeting, exclaimed: &#8220;I can&rsquo;t believe you just said that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Burlington told Taylor that although he did not necessarily expect her to use the word in her story, he thought that doing so gave the story more credence.</p>
<p>Burlington says he used the word only once and approached several attendees after the meeting to explain himself. The Daily News account said he had used the word more than a dozen times.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Dec. 30, Surrick denied Burlington&rsquo;s attempt to prevent Fox from mentioning at trial that after the meeting, he told his former coanchor Joyce Evans that someone had referred to her as a &#8220;n- bitch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burlington had said he was simply illustrating what he considered to be an unacceptable use of the word, court filings say. Evans was not at the staff meeting.</p>

		<p>Look for this story to disappear from view.   The media controllers never want Whites to be shown as victims, so this must stop.  Look for tighter controls on how White victimization is reported. Look for a task force on media diversity to come out with guidelines on when and how stories of &#8220;White presumption of victimhood&#8221; be reported.   Guidelines will include denunciations of lingering inequality, disparate impact, and White responsibility for all the black troubles, especially the pernicious legacy of the N word.  All reporting must communicate message that Whites need to do more to foster diversity and help minorities by atoning for the sins of segregation while holding themselves accountable to people of color for unearned White privilege.</p>
<p>Most of all, look for a joint Federal/United Nations/Human Rights Commission to gain total control of all Internet traffic, along with the exercised power of blocking content and shutting down race realism sites like Amren.<br>

		<p>Unless and until we end the absurdly childish banning of &#8220;hate words&#8221; or whatever it is we call this there can be absolutely zero hope. This is nothing more than government treating all of us as kindergartners. In the case of the subject population they may be correct from an intellectual and emotional standpoint, but we cannot allow ourselves to be governed by the lowest denominator. Those emotionally and intellectually incapable of dealing objectively and rationally with perceived pejoratives should simply be ignored as we would ignore a two year old&rsquo;s temper tantrum. </p>
<p>I am far more deeply distressed and for more concrete and rational reasons by the banning of a WORD than this subject group is distressed by its common usage. </p>

		<p>If they can use the N word to greet each other on the streets, praise each other in films and music then this reporter shouldn&rsquo;t have been fired or even be in a court of law, so much for the freedom of speech.  I have been trying to explain this unexplainable double standard to my boys for years.  Both are constantly being taunted with the N word at school in hopes that my boys will use the word back.  The punishment for white kids using this word in school regardless of who said it first, even if not out of hate, is a day or so out of school if they are lucky.  The black kids are never punished, barely scolded and I am sick of it.  </p>

		<p> This country has gone absolutely paranoid nuts about the use of this word, which is routinely applied by blacks to each other, but brings howls of outrage when used by a White person. There is no comparable word that, when uttered by blacks, would bring opprobrium down on their heads as this one does to Caucasians.</p>
<p> That the uttering of this word in a meeting of journalists, merely in the context of &#8220;Can we say &hellip;&hellip; now?&#8221; can result in all this legal slumgullion, just shows how far we have sunk when it comes to straining at gnats and gulping camels. And, by the way, a regular feature on Jay Leno&rsquo;s Tonight Show is something called &#8220;White Trash Designing,&#8221; or words to that effect. The (mostly White) audience always yuks it up at this segment   &mdash;   but if he had a similar one called &#8220;&hellip;&hellip; Rigging,&#8221; they would have a collective conniption.</p>

		<p>Wow, a white man finally with the nads to go through this ordeal.</p>
<p>I remember when the comedian from Seinfeld was destroyed for using the word during a comedy routine, where he was playing the idiot Kramer, who would&rsquo;ve responded as he did to heckling.  That very night on Comedy Central, a black comedian (Chapelle) sed the word at least a hundred times, as if to prove that he can use it, but a white cannot.  </p>
<p>I want to see this go to The Supreme Court.  I want to see if they rule the restriction of a word, any word, as constitutional.  The keystone of hate crime legislation is the use of words or symbols.  Those select symbols and words have been nominated by groups like The NAACP and the SPLC for obvious purposes.</p>

		<p>according to the other article,this was said by the offended woman</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the suit, Evans told Burlington that &ldquo;he did not &lsquo;get it&rsquo; regarding the use of the word&rdquo; and that as a white person, &ldquo;he was never permitted to use that word.</p>

		<p>This should be a no brainer. While I do not use the word and I think no one should for that mater, common sense should dictate that no one who is not Black should use or even think that it is appropriate to use uch a word. </p>
<p>To me, it is the equivalent of calling a woman the C-word. Some women refer to one another with the word, but a man is likely to be slapped if he does. Secondly, why would anyone even want to use such vile language?</p>
<p>Some things are just unnacceptable. Period.  </p>

		<p>I actually live in NYC and my business is in Philly and I can assure you the &ldquo;N-word&rdquo; is not offensive to any black through my personal experiences in these urban cities. I have never, I repeat, never&hellip; went a day in the last 15 years without hearing several blacks use the &ldquo;N-word&rdquo;. And for any black person to look appalled or claim to be offended by this stupid word is complete and utter nonsense. </p>
<p>There is a complete double standard in this country, and I&rsquo;m sick and tired of hearing about this word, especially coming from the worst offenders that use it&hellip;.blacks. Something has to be done, but what can we do?  How can we make a change and turn the tables and prove that blacks use the &ldquo;N-word&rdquo; daily and that it is NOT &ldquo;offensive&rdquo;. Why should we keep reading about whites being discriminated for such double standard nonsense? </p>

		<p>The childish behavior of being offended by a &#8220;word&#8221; will finally get its day in court, and the whole world will mock America and its baffling political correctness.  It&rsquo;s the same non-sense as the removal of the word from Mark Twains book.  Who&rsquo;s to say the &#8220;n-word&#8221; will have the same impact in 30 years as it does now?  Why fire someone, or remove historical texts simply to appease the child-like behavior of today?  It&rsquo;s time for these men and women to grow-up and stand on their own two feet rather than blame their ills on the simple quarter second quivering of someone&rsquo;s vocal chords.  The so called &#8220;n&#8221; word and its spooky mysticism is the same third-world train of thought as blaming the witches of the village for the drought. </p>

		<p>This hysteria over a word is ridiculous. Changing the term used to refer to something does not alter a person&rsquo;s perception of the thing being referred to. It also does not change the thing itself.  An n-word by any other name&hellip;  </p>

		<p>A few pieces of evidence showing we are such an ignorant and uneducated society is right here in this article:</p>
<p>1. The negative manner in which we address ourselves.<br>
2. The negative manner in which we address others.<br>
3. The lack of morals, ethics, and civility within the population.<br>
4. Thinking that the only solution to every problem, especially racial, is to bring suit against each other in a corrupt judicial system.<br>
5. A judicial system in which no one seems to care is corrupt.<br>
6. Selective outrage.<br>
7. Selective persecution.<br>
8. Corporate tolerance of infantile behavior among employees (they all should be fired!).<br>
9. Wasted time and finances on behavior that will remain unchanged but driven into secrecy.<br>
10. The insanity of political correctness in which you can&rsquo;t say a word regardless of the situation.<br>
11. A corporation cannot handle an internal, non-criminal situation without government interference (has a crime really been committed?).<br>
12. It made the news.<br>

		<p>@ #9.: Wake up and get a clue, Mr. Manners. Most civilized people don&rsquo;t like to use those kind of words. But black people do it all the time. And call white people crackers and worse and never get hauled into court. But a white person says the &#8220;N&#8221; word in an intellectual discussion over it and is fired and has to bring a lawsuit to get his job back.</p>
<p>That is classic &#8220;double standard&#8221;, Mr. Manners. Kanye West&rsquo;s latest CD has art work showing dead white women and he sings about killing white women but that&rsquo;s OK, huh? I hope Mr. Burlington has sued for punitive damages and gets a windfall! </p>

		<p>&#8220;If blacks use the &lsquo;R&rsquo;-word on the job they need to be reprimanded/fired&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since only whites can Really be racists, many of these &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; words probably are intended to be slurs in reality&hellip; When I think of the &#8216;R&rsquo; word, though, I think of the word &#8216;Redneck&rsquo;. As far as I know, the word &#8216;Redneck&rsquo; is the nearest corollary to the &#8216;N&rsquo; word. As far as I know, their &#8216;meaning&rsquo;, the purpose for using these words is the same, with the exception of it being harder, perhaps, for the speaker to defend the &#8216;R&rsquo; word as not being racist. Usually they stop somewhere soon in their explanation. I&rsquo;ve seen people continue to explain it, though. Even heard them say, &#8220;Well, so and so Really is a &#8216;redneck&rsquo;&#8221;. I&rsquo;ve heard people say, at work. &#8220;that &#8216;redneck&rsquo; needs to be fired&#8221;. Guess who got fired? I&rsquo;ve even heard people argue, &#8220;one of those words, the &#8216;N word&rsquo; has been used while people were murdered&#8221;. Frankly, I&rsquo;m sure statistics will show more whites have been murdered by blacks than the other way around - both for racial reasons and not. Maybe it&rsquo;s Ok because of discrimination - oh wait, the TV station heavily discriminates against whites in the name of &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, without a doubt.  </p>
<p>As far as I know the words have the same intended meaning, are the nearest possible equivalency. The only difference that I can see is in our tolerant and sensitive and politically correct and equal society, generally, it&rsquo;s been my observation people use the word &#8216;redneck&rsquo; in an effort to prove to everyone else how enlightened they are.  </p>
