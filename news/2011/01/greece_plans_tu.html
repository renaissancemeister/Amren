<h1><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12109595">Greece Plans Turkey Border Fence to Tackle Migration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, January 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Greece has announced plans to build a 12km (eight-mile) fence along part of its border with Turkey to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing. </p>
<p>Public Order Minister Christos Papoutsis said more than 100,000 people had entered Greece illegally last year and Athens had a duty to act.</p>
<p>Greece has long complained to Turkey about border security.</p>
<p>But the European Commission said such fences were &#8220;short-term measures&#8221; which did not tackle the root of the problem.</p>
<p>The proposed fence would cover a short section of the Greece-Turkey border in the Orestiada area of north-eastern Greece.</p>
<p>The area has become the main route into Greece for migrants from Africa and Asia with an average of 245 people crossing illegally every day in October 2010, according to Frontex, the EU&rsquo;s border agency. </p>
<p>The European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmstroem, has said the numbers are &#8220;dramatic&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr Papoutsis said Greece could &#8220;no longer tolerate this&#8221;.</p>
<p>Greece has proven itself completely incapable of handling this problem, and they&rsquo;ve gotten precious little support from the EU member-states&#8221;</p>
<p>End Quote Bill Frelick Human Rights Watch </p>
<p>&#8220;Greek society has exceeded its limit in its capacity to accommodate illegal immigrants,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the hard reality and we have an obligation to the Greek citizen to deal with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the Greek coastguard would also be upgraded and modernised to tackle illegal migration.</p>
<p>&#8216;Short-term&rsquo; </p>
<p>But the proposals have come under criticism in Greece, with the Greek Communist Party describing them as &#8220;inhuman and ineffective&#8221;. </p>
<p>Bill Frelick from Human Rights Watch told the BBC World Service the fence might &#8220;divert some of the flow to other locations, but Greece has quite a long border, quite a lot of coastline, so it&rsquo;s an attempt at a quick fix for a problem that really is much more extensive&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a person who passes through Greece applies for asylum in Sweden or Germany, their fingerprints show up on what&rsquo;s called the eurodoc system, and they&rsquo;re kicked back to Greece,&#8221; Mr Frelick said. </p>
<p>&#8220;And Greece has proven itself completely incapable of handling this problem, and they&rsquo;ve gotten precious little support from the EU member-states.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, a spokesman for the EU Commission said that walls and bars were &#8220;short-term measures which will not allow us to tackle illegal immigration in a structural manner&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We made clear with Greece that the country needs sound and long-term structural reforms and measures to better manage its border, to better address the challenges linked to migration flows,&#8221; Michele Cercone said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important that these borders &hellip;   are managed in order to discourage and interrupt traffickers and smugglers that exploit [illegal immigrants].&#8221;</p>
<p>Turkey&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said it was seeking further information about the plans, but the governor of Edirne, one of the country&rsquo;s border provinces, said all physical barriers were surmountable.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a 200km river that can be passed with boats in winter and by foot in summer when the water level is low,&#8221; Gokhan Sozer told NTV.</p>
<p>Around 90% of all migrants who illegally enter the EU have come through Greece, say officials.</p>
<p>The UN&rsquo;s refugee agency says 38,992 arrived in the 10 months to November 2010, compared with 7,574 for the same period of 2009.</p>
<p>In November, Frontex deployed 175 border control specialists to the Orestiada area to help Greece tackle the problem. </p>
<p>The agency says this led to a 44% fall in the numbers of people successfully crossing the border.<br>

		<p>&#8220;To the Jews first, and then the Greeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is what the Apostle Paul said, and in the matter of walls, and some other things, he was right.</p>
<p>The Jews built their wall, now the Greeks.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t hold your breath for the USA  &mdash;  I have searched the scriptures and the words, &#8220;To the Jews first, then the Greeks, then the Americans&#8221; are nowhere to be found! Alas!</p>
<p>I found something about a huge harlot, though, intoxicated with the blood of decent people.</p>

		<p>They escaped communism but became part of something more insidious: liberal democratic capitalism not to mention that the population exchanges that forced Greeks to leave their native Anatolia and the Turks to leave conquered Greece is being voided by obligatory open immigration. Plus Greece is bound to maintain the status quo to placate Brussels in their name dispute with Skopje and to get future bail out money. Bad, bad, bad</p>

		<p>Is it just me or do I sense something changing in Europe?  Are the hard economic times changing European sentiment toward immigration? </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not &#8220;migration&#8221; - I have never heard of Greeks having any problem with birds or fish coming or going as they please.  The issue is illegal incursions.  <br>

		<p>Poor Greece. The fence needs to be electrified. 5,000 volts should do it. Too bad we can&rsquo;t do it along our Mexican border here - too many bleeding heart idiots.</p>

		<p>Silly Greeks, don&rsquo;t they know fences don&rsquo;t work?  Ask any member of the main stream media who belittle a US/Mexico fence.  Somehow fences work to restrain all mammals except humans.  And at that only along the Mexican border.  Otherwise they are in widespread use.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;capacity&#8221; for a nation, any nation, to &#8220;absorb&#8221; illegal aliens should be ZERO.</p>
<p>NOT a short fence for a short term, but a HIGH WALL for a long term. Much better.</p>
<p>It is their country, isn&rsquo;t it? The indigenous people have rights that the U.N. recognizes. An indigenous people have a right ot defend what is theirs. The Greeks are the indigenous people.</p>

		<p>The Allies sustained 141,000 casualties in the failed campaign at Gallipoli.  Of these 141,000 men, NONE were Greek.  In the entire first world war, Greece sustained a grand total of 5,000 casualties.  Greece spurned their chance of pushing Turkey back across the Dardanelles 95 years ago.  No sympathy.</p>

		<p>It is no coincidence that the Greek economy descended into a pit of despair exactly comtemporaneously with the Greek political class being &#8216;clever&rsquo; and &#8216;European&rsquo; by accepting mass third world immigration.<br>
 There IS a direct, causal link between these two horrible phenomena - don&rsquo;t let anyone kid you not.<br>
 In short, the third-world immigrants destroyed Greece.</p>

		<p> That would have been great if they had done it in the early 00s before this huge influx of Asians started.But now,after the Iraq and Afghanistan wars Greece,especially Athens,has been filled with Pakistanis and Afghans of the worst kind.<br>
 Maybe one of the good things with the IMF is that our state no longer has money to feed those criminals.</p>

		<p>The commies and lefties in Greece are already screaming about how inhumane and ineffective the new border will be. As to the argument that it is ineffective, the fact that they scream so much has me convinced that it will be VERY effective, which is why they don&rsquo;t want it built. The commies and lefties &#8216;solution&rsquo; is to leave the borders completely open, not only with Turkey but with all the other EU countries, so that these poor third-world Muslim immigrants can travel freely to the country of their choice. Up to 50 years ago the Greeks had the good sense of imprisoning and shooting communist traitors, but now these traitors are revered by the mainstream media and nobody dares criticize them. If you say anything against them you are a &#8216;fascist&rsquo; and a &#8216;racist&rsquo;. </p>
<p>I would also encourage the editors of AMREN to cover the story that in the New Years eve public celebration in the centre of Athens there was not a single Greek - I repeat not a single Greek, just a sea of Pakistani, Kurd, Somalian and Albanian illegals. Nor for that matter were there any women and children; only sexless, sexually starved illegal males. The Greeks can&rsquo;t even celebrate New Years in their own capital city any more. You must report this story, it is really without precedent for any European capital.</p>

		<p>  I get the impression that if your dark skinned the Turks will help you to reach the Greek border. I  think there is about as much tolerance for illegal aliens in Turkey as there is sympathy for the Greeks.</p>

		<p>This is a good opportunity to mention this.</p>
<p>That Greek wall is going to be 12 km long? </p>
<p>The new and recently finished double fence between India and Bangladesh is 4,000 kilometers long. Double fence twelve feet high with razor wire betweend the two fences, the fences lit at night, and patrolled on the Indian side by squads of para-military troops armed with assault rifles.</p>
<p>The question must be raised over and over, if India can do it, why cannot the U.S. do it?</p>
