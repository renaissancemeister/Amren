				</blockquote>
				<p>
					<span class="dropcap">F</span>or most of the past 2,400 years, 
Europeans have understood history much as the Greeks did: as an effort 
to understand what really happened. We have taken for granted their 
pioneering insight that history should not be myth or fairy tale but   &mdash;   
to the greatest extent possible   &mdash;   the truth. Now, according to the 
Australian historian Keith Windschuttle, a powerful new movement is 
undermining the very foundations of the academic discipline of history. 
Known by such names as &#8220;postmodernism,&#8221; &#8220;deconstructionism,&#8221; or 
&#8220;universal history,&#8221; the new intellectual fashion holds that since the 
past is unknowable, history is no more real than fiction   &mdash;   that what 
used to pass for history was nothing more than the expression of the 
unconscious biases of historians. 
				</p>
				<p>
					According to Mr. Windschuttle, this way of thinking is now 
rampaging through virtually every history department in the 
English-speaking world, discrediting the traditional, fact-based view of
 history and the die-hards who still practice it. It is Mr. 
Windschuttle&rsquo;s fear   &mdash;   reflected in the title of his book   &mdash;   that current 
thinking could completely transform and falsify the way we understand 
the past. The <i>Killing of History</i> is a description of what is happening in history departments and a stinging critique of the thinking that drives it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Although Mr. Windschuttle only touches on this, the destruction of 
history is a central element in the destruction of the thinking, 
culture, and people of the West. First elaborated and disseminated by 
whites who hate their own intellectual traditions, this new &#8220;history&#8221; is
 a powerful weapon in the hands of anyone whose only interest is the 
exercise of power in the name of his own group. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b> French Mumbo Jumbo </b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					For those outside the university, it is difficult to imagine that 
the queen of the humanities could be dethroned. Nevertheless, Mr. 
Windschuttle cites this 1991 description of a compulsory honors seminar 
in history: 
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					&#8220;The old-fashioned concept of the historian&rsquo;s task was that he 
(rarely she) &#8220;described what really happened in the past.&rsquo; This notion, 
though still widely held, has been exploded by theoretical developments 
which have occurred largely outside the field of history itself. The 
work of social philosophers, anthropologists, linguists, scientists, 
political, literary and feminist theorists, have, from a variety of 
directions and with increasing momentum, exploded the old concept of 
history.&#8221; 
				</blockquote>
				<p>This was a seminar at the University of Sydney, but Mr. 
Windschuttle assures us it could have been anywhere in America, England 
or Canada. </p><table class="boxright"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/1998/02/writing.gif" alt="" align="right" height="146" width="150" /></td>
          </tr>
         </tbody></table>
		<p>
					What are these &#8220;theoretical developments&#8221; that have &#8220;exploded&#8221; 
history? Mr. Windschuttle has studied them carefully and makes a manful 
go of trying to explain them, but as he points out, they are almost 
deliberately opaque. The founding fathers are all French   &mdash;   people like 
Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, and Pierre Bourdieu   &mdash;   
and take pride in writing impenetrable prose. Prof. Derrida, one of the 
original high priests, has even said that clear writing is the sign of a
 reactionary. Mr. Windschuttle notes that there are plenty of books 
written about &#8220;postmodernism&#8221; and &#8220;post-structuralism&#8221; but the authors 
have learned from their masters only too well: &#8220;most [such books] leave 
the uninitiated reader more confused than when he or she started.&#8221; Mr. 
Windschuttle&rsquo;s own account leaves the reader with little appetite for 
the details of which Frenchman thinks what, but the confusing and often 
contradictory essentials can be more or less summarized as follows: 
		</p>
				<blockquote>
					First of all, facts are fundamentally unknowable. Partly, this is 
because we describe the world with words, and words never fully convey 
reality. Also, we are all so thoroughly imprisoned by our own 
experiences and expectations that when we describe what we think are 
facts we are describing our own prejudices. This is especially true for 
historical writing, since the historian may be writing about a period or
 people completely alien to him. Ultimately, therefore, history is no 
different from fiction, so literary critics can analyze a history book 
just as they do a novel. This sounds crazy, but Mr. Windschuttle says 
this approach is sweeping the academy. 
				</blockquote>
			<p>	One especially fashionable critical technique from literature is 
&#8220;deconstructionism.&#8221; The idea is to &#8220;demystify&#8221; a text and explain what 
the author unconsciously meant. Experts claim to be able to show how an 
author was limited by the preconceptions of his age. Since we do not 
discover the truth   &mdash;   only invent it   &mdash;   the trick is to unmask the 
unconscious inventions of others. </p>
<p>
					Literature types are also keen on overarching theory or 
&#8220;meta-narrative.&#8221; They claim to have worked up theories that explain all
 of literature, and are busy with theories that will explain all of 
history. Facts, to the extent that they are even knowable, are of no 
interest unless they fit the theory. (Karl Marx&rsquo; view   &mdash;   that class 
struggle and dialectical materialism explain everything   &mdash;   is the best 
known theory of history; Mr. Windschuttle does not explain what theories
 the literary critics are cooking up.) 
				</p>
				<p>
					The newfangled history is also &#8220;postcolonial.&#8221; History used to be 
written by European colonial masters but should now be written by 
liberated native people, or at least from their point of view. The idea 
of &#8220;the other&#8221; is central to this, the other being the wise native whom 
the colonial bureaucrat misunderstood and therefore despised. These 
days, all sorts are claiming to be &#8220;the other&#8221;: women, homosexuals, 
criminals, the insane, etc. Traditional history is supposed to have been
 written to justify existing power structures but now &#8220;others&#8221; are 
providing the more truthful perspectives that dead white males tried to 
suppress. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, no culture, knowledge, or point of view is absolute. No 
one may criticize anyone else&rsquo;s myths, histories, or &#8220;ways of knowing.&#8221; 
What is true depends on who is saying what to whom. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr. Windschuttle offers more than this, but this is more than 
enough   &mdash;   mysteries already abound. If historians are blinkered by their 
own prejudices, why aren&rsquo;t the poststructuralists equally blinkered? &#8220;We
 are,&#8221; some of them cheerfully reply, and do not claim that their 
&#8220;histories&#8221; are any different from fictions. But then how are we to 
choose between competing versions of the past (or present)? Mr. 
Windschuttle quotes a feminist historian who appears to be a follower of
 Humpty Dumpty: &#8220;Knowledge is entirely an effect of power,  &hellip; we can no longer have any concept of truth at all.&#8221; History is on the side with the big battalions. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Another problem is that when &#8220;poststructuralists&#8221; piously claim 
that no judgments can be passed because all cultures are equal and 
cannot be criticized, they are simply lying. They prohibit criticism 
only of non-whites. As Mr. Windschuttle points out, the 500th 
anniversary of Columbus&rsquo; discovery of America turned into an orgy of 
judgment-passing: &#8220;In book after book  &hellip; 
the whole process of European discovery and settlement was denounced by 
academics as one of the greatest calamities to have befallen not only 
the native Americans but the human species as a whole and, indeed, the 
planet itself.&#8221; Mr. Windschuttle notes that historians have been seized 
with a &#8220;fervour to adopt a politically correct stance against their own 
society.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					Likewise, only whites are excluded from the view that there are 
many differing truths validly held by different cultural groups. 
Historians can now win debates, not by pointing out that someone got the
 facts wrong (no one much cares about them anymore), but by unmasking 
the white, phallocratic character of an opponent&rsquo;s thinking. The 
stone-age, head-hunting character of a New Guinean&rsquo;s thinking is, of 
course, not a defect. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Occasionally someone asks the all-cultures-are-equal school to 
justify societies that practice human sacrifice or cannibalism. No 
problem. Once these traditions are understood in proper cultural 
context, it is clear that they are not nearly so bad as plenty of things
 white people have been doing for centuries. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Perhaps the purest expression of relativism   &mdash;   held, apparently, by 
only a hardy few   &mdash;   is to claim that science itself is just another white
 man&rsquo;s prejudice and is no more valid than voodoo or witch doctoring. 
Mr. Windschuttle has actually dug up a Professor Paul Feyerabend at 
Berkeley who claims that the &#8220;knowledge&#8221; of necromancers and haruspices 
is as valid as that of geologists.

				<p>
				  <b>					Not a Joke				  </b>
				</p>
<p>
					All this ought to be a huge joke but, alas, it is not. A school 
district in California has reportedly been demanding text books that 
contradict the general consensus that American Indians crossed a land 
bridge from Asia during the last Ice Age. According to the Indians &rsquo; own
 myths they have been here much longer; how dare archaeologists claim to
 know better? Likewise, the Aborigines say they sprang from the soil of 
Australia, so we are now supposed to ignore the clear evidence that they
 migrated from the Indonesian archipelago. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Misappropriations of history for political purposes are routine. 
Some of the questions raised elsewhere in this issue of AR are whether 
Martin Luther King was a womanizer, plagiarist, and communist 
sympathizer, and whether the African who led the <i>Amistad</i> 
rebellion became a slave trader after he was freed. According to 
contemporary historiography, the facts can&rsquo;t be known and even if they 
could they wouldn&rsquo;t matter. Such so-called facts are subsumed in the 
&#8220;meta-narrative&#8221; of white wickedness and black virtue. To raise these 
questions does not illuminate the past; it only reveals the prejudices 
of the white males who write for AR. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The notion that facts merely serve theory has found ready 
acceptance outside the university. Whenever a notorious &#8220;hate crime&#8221; is 
shown to be a hoax, someone is bound to tell us that the so-called facts
 do not matter; even a phony &#8220;hate crime&#8221; properly highlights the 
sufferings of non-whites at the hands of whites. The 1987 Tawana Brawley
 hoax flushed out many an amateur &#8220;poststructuralist,&#8221; as did black 
college student Sabrina Collins&rsquo; 1990 claim that her Emory University 
dorm room had been vandalized. Needless to say, goose and gander get 
different sauces. Incantations about the unknowability of the past may 
never be mumbled over the memory of slavery or the Wounded Knee 
massacre. 
				</p>
					What is looming in history departments is not just a disaster for 
scholarship. It would be a tragedy if the ancient practice of 
accumulating and evaluating evidence were abandoned; history as we know 
it would cease to be written. But this is much more than an academic 
question. As Humpty Dumpty and the feminists are brazen enough to admit,
 to jettison any pretense to objectivity is to make a naked grab for 
power. If stylish barbarians really do manage to destroy history, the 
past will belong to whichever mob shouts the loudest   &mdash;   and the mob will 
find in the past innumerable crimes for which its enemies in the present
 must be punished.

						<p>
							<i>"O Tempora O Mores," American Renaissance, February 1998</i></font>
						</p>
<p>
					<i>Amistad</i> is the new Steven Spielberg movie about a slave 
revolt aboard a Spanish ship. The historical episode on which it is 
based was an 1839 mutiny by Africans who were being transported from one
 Cuban port to another. They killed most of the crew of the <i>Amistad</i>
   &mdash;   which means &#8220;friendship&#8221; in Spanish   &mdash;   and demanded that they be 
returned to Africa. Instead, a white crewman steered them north, where 
they were picked up by the U.S. navy and taken to New Haven, 
Connecticut. 
				</p><table class="boxright"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/1998/02/amistad.gif" alt="" align="right" height="193" width="275" /></td>
          </tr>
         </tbody></table>
		<p>
					The Spanish wanted the slaves returned and tried for piracy. The 
case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, where John Quincy Adams argued that
 the slave trade was illegal and that slavery was a violation of natural
 rights. The blacks were freed and taken back to Africa. 
		</p>
				<p>
					There is ample material here for the usual story line: black 
nobility in the face of white brutality that is leavened with occasional
 flashes of humanity. As revisionist scholar Michael Hoffman has pointed
 out, the movie leaves out an inconvenient fact reported on page 520 of 
Samuel Eliot Morison&rsquo;s 1965 book, <i>Oxford History of the American People:</i>
 &#8220;The ironic epilogue is that Cinque [the leader of the revolt] once 
home, set himself up as a slavetrader.&#8221; Adams&rsquo; fine notions about 
natural rights were handy to have in an American courtroom, but Cinque 
and the boys promptly junked them when they got home. 
				</p>
				<p>
					None of this bothers President Clinton, who attended the Washington premier of <i>Amistad</i>
 and offered this specimen of his jumbled thinking about race: &#8220;I would 
like all those who oppose affirmative action to see this marvelous 
movie.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>Amistad</i> comes with a study guide that is being distributed 
to high schools so that teachers can work this marvelous movie into 
lesson plans. The guide quotes the producer as saying that &#8220;the White 
culture wanted to be dominant. They never acknowledged the contributions
 of the African culture that was far beyond and centuries ahead of 
European culture.&#8221; It also suggests that Cinque helped Adams craft the 
arguments that prevailed in court, despite the fact that Cinque spoke no
 English and probably never met Adams. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The movie has other problems. A black writer, Barbara Chase-Riboud, claims it plagiarized her 1989 novel, <i>Echo of Lions.</i> Mr. Spielberg&rsquo;s lawyers say Miss Chase-Riboud is the plagiarist, having lifted passages from someone else&rsquo;s novel, <i>Slave Mutiny,</i> which Mr. Spielberg had optioned for the movie. Miss Chase-Riboud admits that one of her earlier novels, <i>Valide,</i> contains passages she took from another book, but says <i>Echo of Lions</i>
 is clean. Who stole what from whom will presumably become clear in 
court. In the meantime, no one is in any kind of trouble for anti-white 
distortions of history. (Margarett Loke, Writer Who Cried Plagiarism 
Used Passages She Didn&rsquo;t Write, New York Times, Nov. 19, 1997, p. A1.)

		<p>Windschuttle engaged in something of a little debate with Professor Andrew Fraser a while ago. It was sad that Windschuttle resorted to name-calling and personal insinuations. Ordinarily good Conservative writers such as he are utterly blind to the subject of race. They cannot make the logical leap.</p>

The &#8220;preconceptions of his age&#8221;; I shudder to think that so called &#8220;historians&#8221; succumb to the most fundamental of logical fallacies - &#8220;chronological snobbery.&#8221; You know, they were so &#8220;primitive back then!&#8221; Any college student that took philosophy 101 knows about chronological snobbery and its&rsquo; dangers. We have been shown time and again that those guys living thousands of years ago were not stupid. The pyramids, the Antikythera mechanism, the Baghdad battery, etc.! <br>
Perhaps some person a thousand years from now will pick up one of their bone dry skulls and proclaim &#8220;they were so primitive back then!&#8221; And the cycle will continue!</p>

		<p>Leftists are on top of this and are for the most part in complete control. The minute an academic like Windschuttle writes a book or makes a statement, 10 other academics and media types will twist this around saying Windschuttle&rsquo;s work is an example of the evil &#8216;revisionism&rsquo; going on in our midst behind the scenes. Windschuttle is also a bit late. They heyday of consolidating the change in histories lessons was during the 1980&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s. Western man eradicating the disease of smallpox from the globe became, white men eradicate people of color with smallpox.  </p>

		<p>Among certain elements in Aussie land, Mr. Windschuttle is highly reviled. The claim has been made for decades or longer - - that the whitey Australians EXTERMINATED THE ABORIGINES OF TASMANIA!!</p>
<p>Mr. Windschuttle investigated the various histories written about this &#8220;history&#8221; and found that the conventional &#8220;history&#8221; was more or less a fabrication done deliberately so for political reasons, to fit into pre-conceived notions of what &#8220;was&#8221;! The aborigine Tasmanian is still alive and well, NOT exterminated!</p>

		<p>I wonder if this new history revision conduct will be applied to black history in America and turn it around to suggest that the blacks were pirates that invaded our coast and we fought against them and defeated them&hellip;..NO NO, can&rsquo;t have blacks come out on the losing side&hellip;how bout, they were here first and Whites invaded their utopian country! Yeah! that&rsquo;s it. Mustn&rsquo;t outrage the blacks or Muslims. And just imagine, we are 9 days away from having to put up with an entire federally forced all praise blacks month. We get to acknowledge their immense contributions to space travel, medical science, astrophysics, psychology, the humanities, mathematics and&hellip;..well, just name something and blacks made significant contributions, and THEN comes March and things will be mostly back to reality!</p>

If &#8220;we can no longer have a concept of truth at all,&#8221; then why should we believe that any of the dogmas of political correctness are true? Maybe they&rsquo;re just the oppressive narrative of the dominant Marxist, feminist, multicultural power structure.   </p>

		<p>The big thing in high schools recently is looking at the Seven Lens of history.  This approach discards chronological history (first this happened, and it caused this, then this happened&hellip;) in favor of a &#8216;thematic&rsquo; approach.</p>
<p>In other words, all the conflicts of the world (wars) are lumped together in one unit.  All the governmental systems in another unit, the migrations in another and so on.</p>
<p>This system is so terrible as to not be believed.  The kids come away with no sense of the passage of time or with a clear trin of cause and effect.  Instead, they are given a mishmash of facts, biographies and events with no seeming relation to things in the other 7 &#8216;lenses&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Can you guess the over-arching theme that is meant to tie them all together is?  You guessed it: &#8220;Social Justice!&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8216;Facing History, Facing Ourselves&rsquo; curriculum is also used by most history teachers today.  It is a mish-mash and anti-white lessons about the holocaust, colonialism and every other era.  Whites ae presented as the bad guys everwhere.  All non-whites are presented as oppressed and innocent with noble cultures.</p>
<p>Ever heard of the movie Avatar?  This is the &#8216;baby&rsquo; of liberals everywhere, and it reflects perfectly how most under 35-year-old history teachers teach today.</p>

		<p>In reply to Jeddermann (#4), I am no expert on anthropology, and have only the same knowledge as most of my fellow Australians. However, I think I can help.</p>
<p>Tasmania was separated from the Australian mainland when the sea rose after the Ice Age. The Tasmanians evolved separately and are regarded as somewhat different from, and more primitive than, the mainland Aborigines. </p>
<p>There are no longer any full-blooded Tasmanian Aborigines, although there are some people with mixed white/Tasmanian ancestry. The last full-blood was a woman named Truganini, who was born in about 1812 and died in 1876. </p>
<p>Like other Australians I was taught that the demise of the Tasmanians was entirely the fault of white people. Keith Windschuttle says that whites were only partly to blame, and this has caused a great controversy. Certainly, in my opinion, there was a lot of persecution of Tasmanians by white people, but the accidental introduction of European diseases was also a severe problem for the natives: even measles was often fatal, let alone smallpox!</p>

		<p>I think that the reality of our willingness to lie to ourselves comes from three basic processes:</p>
<p>1.  Psychocognitive.<br>
We live in a synthesized world where, once turned on, our brains literally never stop trying to act as differential machines putting object values into statistical categories.  When we reach the limit of our ability to catalog an environment, usually based on knowledge of it&rsquo;s tangible objects rather than the objects themselves, we invent new characteristics for them.  This is the source of imagination and to me it indicates that such differential psychometrics are so hard (metabolically) to achieve that they cannot, ever, be turned off, at the risk of not being able to start them back up again.</p>
<p>2.  Profit Bias.<br>
If you discover something new that invalidates all the old ways of thinking, you are not only a smart person but you are a destroyer of competing viewpoints as a method of gaining converts.  I think this is the basis for most attempts and governance and religion and is almost purely an act of deliberate vice subconscious &#8216;imaginative&rsquo; sadism.  Originally, it may have had some use because it purified assumptions and encouraged a scientific method of internal and external critical reasoning.  As science becomes more and more certain in it&rsquo;s (overlapping, genetics and morphological datums for instance) it becomes less so.  And people whose ability to filter the existing data has also gotten no better look for ways to rebel against the acculturated norm.  Even if they know they are wrong.  </p>
<p>3.  Victim Sympathy.<br>
Which brings us to the notion that the people who are making all these &#8216;new discoveries&rsquo; about ways of thinking are those whose former subjugation came about because they were not able to compete equally in the understanding of established and filtered truths.  Partly, this was gender and race prejudice driven.  Equally, it was gender and racial -disinterest- biased in the achievements of non-identity (ingroup within ingroup factions) based white male achievements.  And mostly it was simply an empathic understanding that if whites males enjoyed what they did, by strength, then injecting them with a poison of doubt over the weakness that gender and racial (genetics) failures had had to live with might open an opportunity for them to &#8216;have their own day&rsquo;.  This sabotage disenfranchisement is the most destructive of all conditional social modifiers because, as we have seen, females and name-this-skin-color ethnic groups have -not- noticeably improved society in an &#8216;unbiased&rsquo; fashion as indeed they bring their own coalition based political baggage with them as &#8220;We must empower all weakness so that no single weaker group stands alone.&#8221;.  Which means that -accomodation- of other histories and viewpoints is the principle weakness in preventing their own social refinement process of genetic algorithm fitness selection.</p>
<p>Taken together, you see why it is now essential to not simply overwrite the present but deny an option to revist a more accurate view of the past: Today&rsquo;s cultures are failing, across the board, due to the lack of vested white dominance as interest in furthering a &#8216;diversity&rsquo; driven standard which rewards failure as being equal to success.</p>
<p>If the world ever knew that the difference between an advanced, technological, culture in the 22nd century and a return to tribal primitivism on the way to extinction lay in admitting that multiculturalism was a total failure, they would choose in favor of their IPods and Feminism and Ethnic Empowerment agendas would be kicked to the street in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Even if it meant reempowering white males.</p>
<p>These people would choose total destruction of advanced civilization over returning to an inferior position on the social ladder.  That is how dangerous they really are.</p>

		<p>Stuff like this shows without any doubt whatsoever that those we have allowed to be a ruling class among us, not only are not worthy, but are so weak and worthless that, sooner, or later, their power will crumble whether anything is done to hasten it or not.</p>
<p>Many look at their behavior and see it as totalitarian anti-white, even genocidal, aggression.  I have a different view.  Their vitriol isn&rsquo;t so much directed at us, as it is themselves.  If you notice, the higher up on the food chain a white person is, the more likely they are to have absorbed such vicious and insane ideology.  It&rsquo;s almost a continuum, with the richest and (supposedly) most powerful, the most indoctrinated.  These people practically salivate at the thought of a non-white underclass rising up and destroying them.</p>
<p>There are two problems with that.  The first is the lack of any real power among non-whites&hellip;.who can&rsquo;t even feed themselves for a few days without direct handouts from whites.  The day those handouts stop will be the day that non-whites die off.  Almost all of them will be gone within a few short weeks.  Almost all of them will simply squat in whatever urban hellhole they are being warehoused in, lay down and die.  That is who and what they are&hellip;.and no amount of liberal redistribution of wealth will change that.</p>
<p>The second problem is that whites, as a people, are not represented by our elites.  Increasingly, this group has little in common with normal folk.  Were one to show up at a gathering of whites and ask them to do something, they would laugh in his face.  My point is, this position has certain power inherit because of our monetary system&hellip;.but there is no longer any inherit respect or fear.  They are not better than us and no one thinks they are better than us.</p>

		<p>These left leaning &#8220;historians&#8221; love to smear whitey, particularly with my personal favourite, that Columbus wiped out a &#8220;peaceful indigenous population&#8221; by passing influenza to them, a new disease for which they had no immunity.</p>
<p>Forgotten are the facts that these &#8220;peaceful indigenous peoples&#8221; returned the favor with Syphillis -a disease that the whole world now suffers from -and had been entirely unknown prior to trans-atlantic exploration. Forgotten is the fact that the &#8220;peaceful native americans&#8221; who &#8220;lived harmoniously with nature and took no more than they needed&#8221; (a laughable idea currently fashionable in what passes for school these days) also wiped out a significant portion of North America&rsquo;s biodiversity and caused the extinction of no less than 4 identified species of large animals. </p>
<p>As the CIA states (and Wikileaks agrees) &#8220;Veritas vos liberabit&#8221;<br>
-The Truth Will Set You Free. Hence the Truth must be forever hidden, disparaged or ridiculed when it cannot be denied.<br>

		<p> Keith Windshuttle if memory serves me right was an historian<br>
and media commentator who started off ostensibly on the left<br>
and has drifted across to the called right&hellip;.I read his book on<br>
unemployment while at uni in the early 80s.<br>
 There seems to  be an ongoing controversy about the treatment of<br>
Aborigines,especially in Tasmania.The gist of what Windshuttle<br>
appears to be saying is that history of white settlement was not necessarily about the brutal slaughter and massacre of the Aborigines.Many aborigines succumbed to disease and their society was often marked by tribal conflict well before the arrival of<br>
the white man.Interestingly William Buckley,An English convict who escaped after transportation to Australia and lived with local Aborigines for nearly 40 years gave his main reason for returning to white society as being fed up of all the tribal violence he witnessed between the Aborigines.Looking at the <br>
sorry state of several outback towns/communities almost overrun by local Aborigines in Australia now you would think not too much has changed.<br>
  I think Windshuttle is simply arguing we shouldnt distort history for the sake of political correctness,a line not unlike<br>
that of many on this website.Native peoples all over the world,<br>
not just in Australia,did not live a simple `dreamtime&#8220;existence in eternal peace and harmony.To blame the white man on all the ills they have suffered since,whether Australian Aborigine or American Indian, is far far too simplistic  and ultimately in self denial as to neglect the amazing technological accomplishments that Europeans have bought<br>
to the New World and beyond and a standard of living nomadic<br>
peoples could never ever comtemplate or achieve even left for another ten thousand  years.<br>
If it is/was such a  bad thing  then I suggest   <br>
these modern urban  liberals should pack up,go outback/tribal and see how they would fare with their `native brothers and sisters`.  <br>

<p>wow, what a post. That&rsquo;s so right. They&rsquo;ve sort of sunk their own ship. Sawed off the limb behind them. </p>
<p>Steve Sailor talked about something like this in one of his essays. It&rsquo;s always management that goes along with these anti-white practices more than anybody. One way to look at it is, that&rsquo;s how they became management. I think for the most part, though, they truly believe in it. Anything to keep peoples minds on &#8216;the real issue&rsquo; and anything to make people more sensitive, towards people of color.<br>

		<p>One of my dearest friends is a Ph.D. retired history professor at a CA university.  He defends &#8220;revisionist history&#8221; as being more accurate than the traditional history.  In some cases it&rsquo;s true   &mdash;   George Washington did NOT cut down a cherry tree, for instance.  However, as a music history major, I was taught to go directly to the source writings of the period - newspaper articles and photos, diaries, books of the period, etc.  These tell a much different story than what the revisionists have dreamed up.  Also, I was taught that it is purely ignorant folly to judge the past by the standards of the present.  This, I believe, is the most serious &#8220;sin&#8221; of the revisionists.  What happened in the South and elsewhere, happened   &mdash;   but to judge it in a negative light is a fool&rsquo;s errand.  Certainly there are things we could have done better - but in a different time and different mind-set, such things were not even conceived of.  It is time for historians to ACCEPT what happened in the past, and to then quit judging it.  All that does is make the judg-ers feel superior to the judg-ees, and contributes nothing to truth.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Known by such names as &ldquo;postmodernism,&rdquo; &ldquo;deconstructionism,&rdquo; or &ldquo;universal history,&rdquo; the new intellectual fashion holds that since the past is unknowable, history is no more real than fiction&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The beauty of postmodernist, deconstructionist critique is that the tools of these critiques are NOT the sole purview of the left.</p>
<p>It is just as easy to deconstruct a lefty opinion piece as it is to deconstruct the right.  Indeed, it is through using these tools that the absurdity of the left truly come to light.</p>
