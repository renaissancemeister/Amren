<h1>Man Sentenced in W. Seattle Attack on Teen Blames It on Four Loko</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christine Clarridge, Seattle Times, January 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ahmed Mohamed, who was sentenced Friday to nearly six years in prison for the attack last year on a West Seattle teen, claimed the caffeine-infused energy beer he drank for the first time the night of the assault was partially to blame.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mohamed, 22, pleaded guilty last month to first-degree robbery with a deadly weapon and malicious harassment, the state&rsquo;s hate-crime statute, for the attack on Shane McClellan on May 25.</p>
<p>According to court documents, McClellan was walking home from a friend&rsquo;s house around 2 a.m. when Mohamed and Jonathan Baquiring, 21, asked the teen for a light.</p>
<p>When the West Seattle teen, who turned 17 on Friday, stopped, Mohamed and Baquiring attacked him.</p>
<p>For more than four hours, according to court documents, the two men punched McClellan, urinated on him, beat him with his own belt and burned him with cigarettes. They also poured Four Loko on the teen and taunted him by saying, &#8220;How do you like it, white boy?&#8221; and, &#8220;This is for enslaving our people,&#8221; according to the charges.</p>
<p>Mohamed, who is black, said in his guilty plea that he and Baquiring targeted McClellan &#8220;because he was a different race than we are.&#8221; McClellan is white.</p>
<p>Baquiring, who is Asian, has pleaded not guilty to the same charges and is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 22.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mohamed apologized to the McClellan family and to his own family for breaking the Muslim custom of eschewing alcohol. He said he felt &#8220;peer pressure&#8221; to drink and wished he could take back his actions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>Incredible. I would think 25 years would be too lenient. But 6 years?? And it is doubtful that he will do half of that. </p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that it is a Muslim &#8220;custom&#8221; to not drink alcohol. I thought it was a very strict rule of the religion. </p>
<p>What was he charged with to only get 6 years? When an adult attacks an under aged minor and holds him for four hours beating and torturing him that sound like a kidnapping charge. Add on the fact that this was a hate crime and I think this guy should do some real time  or maybe get his head cut off to make him feel at home. </p>
<p>With only a 6 year sentence this guy will be out in no time. </p>

		<p>Although Islam strictly forbids the drinking of alcohol, most African muslims ignore the ban and drink like fish. I remember reading a book by an American who travelled around the Meditarranean and North Africa, and had the bad luck to have a drunk muslim Nubian as his driver. Asking how his driver&rsquo;s habit could be reconciled with his religion, the Nubian replied, &#8220;We are Nubians first, muslims second&#8221;. And that was really all that needed to be said. This Somali has probably been drinking since he was a child.</p>

		<p>I think the primary ideological difference in the nature vs nurture argument, with its political and/or social ramifications.</p>
<p>Is on one side you have &#8216;nature&rsquo; or genetic pre-determinism, where people&rsquo;s strengths and weakness&rsquo;s are inherent or &#8216;internal&rsquo; in their origin, thus leaving it up to the individual to know thyself and work to thy own potential.</p>
<p>Where as the &lsquo;nurture&rsquo; crowd believe more so in (potentially curable and expensive) &#8216;external&rsquo; factors as the catalyst for all actions or behaviour.</p>
<p>i.e. &#8220;the caffeine-infused energy beer made me do it&#8221;, &#8220;he/she called me the N-word&#8221;, &#8220;the teacher is bad which is why I&rsquo;m not learning&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>The nurture side removes all responsibility from the individual and places the blame on an endless wheel of indefinable external &#8216;boogie men&rsquo;.    <br>
Making the cure an intrusive socialist big government, with an endless line of expensive social programs that turns the flaws of the few individuals into the sins of the majority. <br>
This punishes all, for the inadequacies of the few, which handily also empowers the weak over the strong.</p>
<p>This is why the Left sees the idea of &lsquo;racial families&rsquo; with inherent traits, as their biggest threat and the racial Right wing as their biggest enemies to be silenced at all costs as it negates the need for their own big government socialistic existence.</p>
<p>Eg. When Omar Thorton went on his rampage or when eight US police officers are shot by black males in an recent 36 hr period&hellip;  https://goo.gl/HvhuJ .<br>
Compare these situations to the Right wings drama of the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Where are all the calls from the Left, to ban Hip hop for instances?<br>
Saying that behaviour is predominately (present day) environmental in its origins, throws all problems into a bottomless, futile black hole (no pun). </p>
<p>This makes a racially blind Government a self perpetuating enabler.<br>

		<p>If drinking excessive amounts of caffeine made you engage in violent racial hate crimes, I&rsquo;d be in prison for life.  This bit about Four Loko being to blame was probably a last minute hail mary on the part of his defense lawyers, because s/he knows that Four Loko has been in the news lately and not for the best of reasons.</p>

		<p><i>Ahmed Mohamed&hellip; claimed the caffeine-infused energy beer he drank for the first time the night of the assault was partially to blame.</i></p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s the fault of Four Loko!</p>
<p><i>CALIFORNIA authorities were investigating the deaths of two teenagers whose bodies were found near an empty can of Four Loko.</i></p>
<p>Four Loko is all the rage among the high school set.  High school kids tell me it is very very common at parties, including parties where &#8220;supervising&#8221; adults are present.  The girls report that the boys encourage them to &#8216;drink up!&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Four Loko, which has been dubbed &#8216;blackout in a can&rsquo; by some drinkers, sells for under $3 and contains as much alcohol as nearly five beers and as much caffeine as several cups of coffee.</i></p>
<p>It seemed to be the new date-rape drug.</p>
<p><i>Nine college students in Washington were hospitalized.  Police initially believed they had been dosed with date rape drugs, but were later found to have consumed rum, vodka and beer in addition to Four Loko.</i></p>
<p><i>Phusion Projects, the maker of Four Loko  continues to assert that the combination of alcohol and caffeine is safe.</i></p>
<p>Phusion Projects, under FDA mandate and threat of confiscation of its product, stripped Four Lokos of its caffeine, however, like all banned product for which there is a huge demand, a black market immediately sprang up to fill the void.  As Harry Browne wrote:  Trying to stop demand for a desired product is like trying to hold back the tides!</p>
<p>Starting weeks prior to the FDA ruling, many fans and others seeking financial gain purchased large quantities of the drink. This buying rush has already created a black market for the drink. Most sellers are charging nearly five times the drink&rsquo;s retail price. Four Loko has already appeared on Craigslist and collectible cans of the drink are being sold on eBay&hellip;.illegal sales of the the original drink have continued, usually for a price of roughly $15 per 24 ounce can.  Young Four Loko dealers have experienced a flood of business that has resulted in many teens quitting their regular jobs because of the cash influx they have received from selling their stashes of Four Loko.</p>

<i>&#8220;One of them was trying to hide an open Four Loko can in his pocket, according to the police report. The officer contacted the men and noted they had dried blood on their hands and were smoking Marlboro Reds, according to court documents.</i>&#8221;<br>
Just cartoonishly guilty, plus they matched the kids&rsquo; description exactly. They might as well have been wearing sandwich boards saying &#8220;We Did It!&#8221;, and yet the cops send them on their merry way? At least they took blood swabs, but doesn&rsquo;t being caught <i>literally</i> red-handed mean anything any more?</p>

		<p>Start small.  Grow Big.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t know whether that means a small victory in gaining racial equity in protection against hate crimes is a &#8216;good idea&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Or whether it simply indicates an escalation in incited race warfare whose Nanny State solution will essentially come down to forcing us all to live like Muslims.</p>
<p>With strictured lives, constantly under the eye and thumb of our minders.</p>
<p>Lest we &#8216;wish-plan-act&rsquo; _think_ about what is really causing our hatreds: Racial compression in a land better left homogenously white ethnic.</p>

		<p>White people in the USA need to face reality.  We are a race that is being neutralized from so many directions such as the court&rsquo;s only sentencing this evil person to 6 years for a vicious hate crime.</p>
<p>That sentence alone denotes a lack of respect for a &#8220;White Person&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is a trend that is expected in this country. Pecking away at White diginity seems to be the norm.</p>
<p>Better take a look at what is happening to Whites in South Africa which is inevitably the sentence too Whites in America. </p>

Energy drinks containing high caffeine, taurine, and sugar contents are popular with young adults.<br>
The drinks were popularized in trashy cities in Europe and sold as an underground drink at 7-11&rsquo;s in the U.S. in the 1980&rsquo;s beginning with beverages like Red Bull.</p>
<p>In the late 1990&rsquo;s European distributors began to market alcohol to minors passing the drinks off as fruit juice.<br>
The subversion spawned a drink in the United States similar to a non-alcoholic beverage called Fruitopia.</p>
<p>Talk Show host Michael Savage and his family sell a brand of energy drink called Rock Star.<br>
The drinks are popular in night clubs and bars and are often combined with alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>These energy drinks are marketed to minors in part as a club drug and parents need to be aware that the drinks fuel everything from street fights, and drug abuse, to political rebellion.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Four Loko is marketed to street gangs and high school teenagers who rationalize that being a street thug is hip.</p>
<p>All this aside, a large and growing number of American&rsquo;s are realizing that violent multi-racial hate crime is fueled by the very companies, celebrities, and politicians, white American&rsquo;s elect to support them against violent crime.</p>
<p>I believe that white American&rsquo;s need to take a specialized approach and align themselves with companies like Target Focus Training and Front Sight firearms training institute and mention them to their local talk shows and politicans until they become popular with consumers who are confronted by a fear of non-white hate crime in the areas where they live.</p>

		<p>Even if he serves every single day of his sentence, six years is still way too light a punishment for this act. The victim will be traumatized for the rest of his life. He should be immediately deported after he gets out of prison, but won&rsquo;t be. The TRUE criminals were the treasonous politicians who let people like him come here to begin with.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Thank you, Bon.<br>
I looked. And I got VERY angry!</p>
<p>This was only a kid, just 16 years, set upon and tortured by two men in their twenties! Total strangers, and both foreigners at that!</p>
<p>Parents, guard your children!  (And what was this boy doing out at 2AM?)</p>

		<p>I live in a Ottawa, Canada where a large number of Somalis have settled.</p>
<p>They are overrepresented in drug selling, gangs, hold-ups, swarmings, break-ins, murders and steet crimes involving violence. They have their own wing of the local correctional facility. Hardly a week goes by when a Somali name doesn&rsquo;t appear in the newspaper connected to an arrest or trial.</p>
<p>The ineffective response has been more money spent on basketball courts and police outreach.</p>
<p>They are a drain on the tax base, increasing the costs of justice and policing, health, education, and other forms of social welfare.  </p>
<p>All this an nobody dares draw attention to the problem, as that would be an indictment of multiculturalism.</p>

		<p> I remember many years ago a drunken peckerwood from Kentucky claimed he committed a crime because he was drunk/made crazy on Kessler&rsquo;s Bourbon. Kessler&rsquo;s used to have a reputation of being a little raw and not very smooth as far as bourbon goes. Of course, no one forced the idiot to drink Kessler&rsquo;s or any other alcoholic beverage. Most locals were amused by the bogus defense and the man was convicted of the crime without motivating circumstances. Somehow, I don&rsquo;t think this Loko packed the punch of the old Kesslers, and doesn&rsquo;t excuse any crimes.</p>

		<p>This is ridiculous. I&rsquo;ve had Four Loko before (as well as Jager bombs), and it&rsquo;s perfectly all right if you use it responsibly.</p>
<p>Oh wait&hellip; I guess the word &#8220;responsibly&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t exist in Somali.</p>

		<p>6 years for an extremely violent and cruel hate crime that easily could have led to the victim&rsquo;s death, eh?</p>
<p>Why is it that I think the sentence would have been much harsher if the skin colors were reversed?</p>

		<p>Another clear double standard against Anglos. Yes, South Africa is the model here in the West (USA). </p>
<p>Thomas Chittum refers to it as &#8220;Imperial Conversion&#8221;:  reducing the White Working Class to 2nd Class Status in order to eliminate resistence to the Global Elites&rsquo; goals. </p>

		<p>I have to agree with the point brought up by browser:(And what was this boy doing out at 2AM?)</p>
<p>What was a 16-year old doing out alone on the streets of Seattle at 2 a.m.?  Where were the parents?  Did they know where their son was at this hour?  Did they know he would walk home alone?  I&rsquo;m not defending the attackers in any way, but are the parents completely blameless in all of this?</p>

		<p>The only way we can deal with Somalis is (a) stop bringing them to the USA and Canada (b) any Somalis who are criminals are promptly deported back to Somalia when they complete their sentences even if they are/were juveniles.<br>
Ideally their whole family should be deported, however the US Constitution&rsquo;s 14th amendment as it has been interpreted by the US courts for the past 60 years won&rsquo;t allow for that.</p>

		<p>Makes perfect sense to me. Blame the beer, rather than the criminal for the criminal&rsquo;s actions! I believe the legal people call it the &#8220;Twinkie Defense.&#8221;</p>
