<h1>Without Aid, DPS May Close Half of Its Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Chambers, Detroit News, January 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Detroit Public Schools would close nearly half of its schools in the next two years, and increase high school class sizes to 62 by the following year, under a deficit-reduction plan filed with the state. </p>
<p>The plan, part of a monthly update Emergency Financial Manager Robert Bobb gives the Department of Education, was filed late Monday to provide insight into Bobb&rsquo;s progress in his attempt to slash a $327 million deficit in the district to zero over the next several years. Under it, the district would slim down from 142 schools now to 72 during 2012-13. </p>
<p>Bobb has said school closures, bigger classes and other measures would be needed if he cannot get help from lawmakers to restructure finances in the state&rsquo;s largest school district. </p>
<p>DPS considered but declined to file for bankruptcy in 2009. In the past year, debt in the district has increased by more than $100 million, brought on by a mix of revenue declines in property taxes, reduced state aid, declining enrollment and an unplanned staffing surge this past fall. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because the district&rsquo;s contract with the Detroit Federation of Teachers requires payments to teachers for class sizes that exceed specified maximums, the district estimates it would spend $10 million in oversize class pay over four years. </p>
<p>Keith Johnson, president of the teachers union, said the proposed class size increases won&rsquo;t work and will never happen. </p>
<p>&#8220;I will never agree to any class-size increases,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;These increases are antithetical to learning. Secondly, our classrooms aren&rsquo;t even built to accommodate those numbers. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The proposal calls for closing 40 schools in fiscal 2012 and 30 schools in fiscal 2013. That would leave DPS with 72 schools for a projected 58,570 students, down from about 74,000 now. The district closed 30 schools this fiscal year, which is expected to save $23 million. The planned closings in fiscal 2012-14 would save more than $33 million. </p>
<p>Bobb said the district could save another $12.4 million from the school closures if it &#8220;simply abandons&#8221; the closed buildings. Past policy has been to keep the closed schools clean and secure, officials said, but the district could cut costs by eliminating storage, board-up and security. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not that the increase in class size is antithetical to learning.  It&rsquo;s that the denizens of Detroit are abhorrent to learn.  They refuse to.  They, like their black run city, is a hopeless cause.  A money pit beyond help.  All brought about by black rule, black antisocial behavior resulting in white flight.  Not that the presence of white kids in a class have ever been shown to somehow increase black learning.  Whites DO pay all the school taxes levied, however.  And why should they remain within the bounds of DPS, footing the bill, only to have their kids exposed to rampant drugs, crime, rape, unruly classes, danger on the streets, dumbed down curriculum, and hostility?  They shouldn&rsquo;t.  They left.  Blacks are their own worse enemy and the enemy of civilization everywhere in the world, of which Detroit is a fine example.</p>

		<p>In fairness, this is a more of a problem with our election systems than with Africans. When your city goes from 2 million to 900,000, it&rsquo;s only reasonable to close half your schools. They should have closed them a decade ago.</p>
<p>But no one wants their schools to be the ones closed, so they refuse to vote for any politician who argues this on the grounds that the plan in &#8220;unfair&#8221;. &#8220;Why should my child have to go to a farther school when other people&rsquo;s children still get neighborhood schools?&#8221; they say. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you select the schools to be closed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the same thing in many white areas, on issues from nuclear waste storage to cutting government programs.</p>

		<p>Pretty soon now, Detroit TV is going to start running documentaries like, &#8220;How can we be as successful as Zimbabwe?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was Arab/black fighting at one of the high schools there a while back, but no news so far as I know recently about more of it.  I&rsquo;m wondering why not, because blacks fight with everybody, because they are less intelligent and their jealousy can&rsquo;t be contained.</p>
<p>www.detnews.com  <br>
&#8220;The Aug. 21 beating death of Maher Almawri by a group of African-Americans outside a Sunoco gas station on Detroit&rsquo;s southwest side has sparked anger among Detroit&rsquo;s Arab-Americans, activists say.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I wonder what Detroits large Arab population thinks about all of this.at least some of their kids must go to these schools. Since they tend to have intact families and aren&rsquo;t on welfare they must be concerned about the mess blacks have made.</p>

		<p>Do you believe this is happening in America?  Abandoning property?  62 students to a class?</p>
<p>It is looking more and more like a return to the values and ways of mother Africa, where most kids who go to school learn in big mobs under a tree in the village.</p>

		<p>I went to public school from 1963 to 1976.  Our classes averaged about 35 with one teacher.  No teacher&rsquo;s aids.  No school security.  Just men and woman, some quite old, who were in charge of us.  How in heavens name did we learn?  In a grammar school built in 1910?  With no A/C!  High School had no A/C and only one gym split down the middle with folding doors to separate boys and girls.  No police presence.  My goodness.</p>
<p>Of course my graduating class of 229 had only 3 blacks. Could that have been the difference?  <br>

		<p>Having sat through a temp-building increase to around 35-40 students in elementary and junior high (thank heavens they were white kids) in the late 70s when last the government was telling us all to relax and we&rsquo;d get through this, I can tell you that the teacher and parent are both correct.</p>
<p>It was sheer hell just to get out to the tiny temp buildings on time and none of them had what I would call great heat or sufficent supplies to be more than the equivalent of an oversized janitorial supply closet.</p>
<p>Yet these people are talking about similarly unmodified rooms into wall-to-wall, &#8216;lecture hall&rsquo;, type environments?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to see the average DPS student GPA before I&rsquo;d believe in that.</p>
<p>Also, if this &#8216;belt tightening&rsquo; involves major changes or increase in bus routes that 33 million is also not going to be as large as predicted.</p>
<p>And the notion of &#8216;falling tax revenues&rsquo; is also going to be a matter of challenge.  If a parent has to pay for their student to be bussed an hour more each day to an out-district school, who is to say that they are getting their money&rsquo;s worth in &#8216;representative state services&rsquo;?</p>
<p>I hear there are parts of Detroit that don&rsquo;t even both collecting taxes anymore.</p>
<p>Certainly the notion of splitting district fiscal obligations between a new startup with no outstanding debt and an old payoff dog sound suspicious, especially if basic health, legal, safety and human services stuff is all being (Detroit Machine) &#8216;transfered to the city&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Job duplication, even if it&rsquo;s just reflagging and staff transfer is never the cheapest route unless you expect a federal lump-sum payout for a later declared bankruptcy.</p>
<p>My advice: don&rsquo;t reboot and don&rsquo;t go charter like N&rsquo;Oleans.</p>
<p>Rather take the highest 15-20% of students and give them a very fiscally austere grade pathway to higher education.</p>
<p>And put the rest into Emily Griffith style vocational training after the 8th grade, based on some kind of aptitude system and with advantaged military selection if they have a good MOS potential.</p>
<p>Whites should just plain _get out_, while they still can.</p>

		<p>I should think that a one room school house would suffice to teach reading and math for grades 2-12 since, in my experience, all blacks of any age are at the same teachable level (grade 2) So they all start out at the bottom and STAY THERE!</p>

		<p>As bizarre as it may sound, it may not be such a bad idea. The schools in Detroit are a worthless money pit. No one of any caliber is attending those schools anyway; the black population is either absent or just causing mayhem. Their only service is to feed those who manage to show up. Virtually no learning is going on there, and even those few who manage to [underhandedly] gradmuacate aren&rsquo;t the slightest bit edumacated. Any teacher worth his salt has/will leave the area</p>

		<p>This must NOT happen.<br>
Without the new multimillion dollar schools for these young male and female blacks they would be out of a nearby property to Mark Up, Damage, Destroy and Defacee. This must not happen because it seems that if they don&rsquo;t have expensive property to destroy they spend too much time thinking of the suffering of the slaves and about the racism in America.<br>
Young blacks seem to hunger for knowledge and would skip a meal rather than give up even one of their text books/<br>

		<p>Detroit, Chicago, Gary IN, Washington DC, Africa, Harlem, have a high amount of rapes, robberies, and murders.  What is the majority population of all these areas?  But how dare someone draw a conclusion that it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re majority black.  Even a black conservative said, &#8220;If whites left tomorrow and told blacks they could have everything, within ten years it would be a ghetto.&#8221;</p>
