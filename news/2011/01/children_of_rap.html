<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40930866/ns/health">Children of Rape Are Latest Legacy of Haiti Quake</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonel Aleccia and Meredith Birkett, MSNBC, January 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A year after Haiti&rsquo;s devastating earthquake, women in Haiti&rsquo;s still-teeming tent cities face yet another threat: sexual violence. With little protection from community or law enforcement, many have been violently raped, only to become pregnant with their attackers&rsquo; children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a new report, Amnesty International documents the rise in sexual violence, including at least 250 rapes reported in the first few months after the earthquake.</p>
<p>Fueled in part by these sexual attacks, the birth rate in Haiti has tripled since the quake, climbing from 4 percent to 12 percent, according to population experts.</p>

		<p>TWELVE percent?!!!!   At that rate (and assuming minimal attrition), there will be twice as many Haitians in only NINE years!  Just in time for the NEXT big Hurricane&hellip;  Let&rsquo;s hope this is only a momentary spike in fecundity!</p>

		<p>Here is how a liberal would solve the problem:</p>
<p>1.  Blame whitey somehow.<br>
2.  Arrange for more billions.<br>
3.  Send more white man&rsquo;s burden young liberals there.<br>
4.  Bring as many hatians to America as possible.  </p>
<p>Diversity is our strength!</p>

		<p>The rape and murder rates are always higher than the norm in black countries, like Haiti, South Africa, Rwanda, etc.</p>
<p>I was surprised to learn via a news interview with an expert that the Caribbean area has high rape stats and has a higher murder rate, per capita, than Mexico, which is astounding, especially since they have suffered 30,000 killed since 2006.</p>

		<p>I have no interest in &#8216;helping Haiti&rsquo; in any sense.</p>
<p>But this is one of those few &#8216;justice has a sperm trail&rsquo; situations where the perps have left their genetic calling cards and a simple sampling of the local adult male population should lead to:</p>
<p>1.  Chemical Castration.  Catch and Release.<br>
2.  Hanging.  If it happened more than once.</p>
<p>See, I have no doubt that &#8216;some&rsquo; of these women did what women in desperate times have always done: trading favors for food and shelter and then screaming foul play when nature has it&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>But according to the CIA factbook there are 9,648,924 people on -half- of an island, roughly the size of Manhattan.</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/oRbiI</p>
<p>A 12 percent birth rate in a single year means that they have whelped 1, 157, 871 into misery on this planet at the same time they flash signs to any camera that will point at them &#8216;asking&rsquo; for cars, housing and free food for life.  Since Wiki states only about 230,000 died-</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/LjsT2</p>
<p>While more than 1 million were rendered homeless, you have effectively replaced, times 4, the dead whose absence might have given a short term easement to the massive overpopulation crisis.</p>
<p>While at the same time, _doubling_ the number of those without a pot to piss in nor a window to throw it out of.</p>
<p>NGOs make the problem even worse and there is simply no way to keep up with the lemming rush.</p>

		<p>According to the CIA world factbook, Haiti has 25 births per 1,000 people, or 2.5% (I guess, though I have never seen it put that way). So if the rate has tripled it would be 7.5%, not 12%. </p>

		<p>I read the comments of liberals on the original article. Many of them actually believe that rape perpetrated by Haitians against Hatians is justifiable because of French colonialism in the 18th century and because of the US and other Western nations later.</p>

		<p>As ever, the iron laws of population dynamics and malthusian constraint operate in Haiti - just like they do with Atlantic cod fisheries or Hudson Bay Company pelt records.<br>
  As soon as &#8216;ecological iches&rsquo; open up due to a mass die-off, it is rapidly filled.</p>

		<p>#4 Anonymous:  Haiti is over 1100 times bigger than the island of Manhattan.  Still, with a population of over 9.600,000 it is overcrowded given that those people are trying to scratch out a living with subsistence farming.  They have long since chopped down all the forests and the country has become one big pile.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute I didn&rsquo;t realize what was going on here.<br>
we need to start selling off the assets of America&rsquo;s whites and start sending these people food and medicine so that they can reproduce on an even higher leve. I would say send them birth control but I think they call that racist today?</p>

		<p>Following in the footsteps of Belle (#9), I read the original comments too. They were full of garbled, teary-eyed, sentimental thinking, devoid of reason, and it was truly depressing to see that probably 9 out of 10 were written by near-idiots. Most of them couldn&rsquo;t even explain themselves coherently.</p>
<p>There were a (very) few crisp, no-nonsense comments, such as one might find on Amren, but those were suppressed as being contrary to the site&rsquo;s rules.  However, I checked their posting rules and found nothing there banning factual, clear-eyed commentary. Their only rule was against <i>personal </i> abuse, threats, and harassment.  Where is the &#8220;abuse&#8221; in expressing lack of sympathy for problems that the Haitians have caused for themselves? And what is PERSONAL about it? </p>
<p>It is obvious that you HAVE TO shed obligatory tears for the Haitians while you decry the wicked whites and the West who have reduced them to such poverty, or else you will be banned for &#8220;abuse&#8221;.</p>
