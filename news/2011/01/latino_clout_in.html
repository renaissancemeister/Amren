<h1><a href="https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/7371746.html">Latino Clout in Congress Appears to Stay Consistent</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gary Martin, Houston Chronicle, January 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The 112th Congress has 26 Latino members, less than the 27 who served for the past two years but a substantial increase from the 19 Latinos in Congress a decade ago, according to records of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO).</p>
<p>All told, there will be 17 Democrats and seven Republicans of Hispanic heritage in the House, along with Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Bob Menendez, D-N.J.</p>
<p>Early indications are that the lawmakers will likely vote along party lines on hot-button immigration issues, officials said Friday.</p>
<p><b>Regional differences</b></p>
<p>Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-San Antonio, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said there is more than ethnicity that will determine how Latino lawmakers vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have Latinos from Idaho and Washington State. You are going to see regional differences. That will define these members, not just their ethnicities,&#8221; Gonzalez said.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
The five new Latino House members include two from Texas: Rep. Francisco Canseco, R-San Antonio, and Rep. Bill Flores, R-Bryan. Flores, as well as Rep. Jaime Herrera, R-Wash., and Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, do not come from Latino-majority congressional districts.</p>

		<p>And just exactly why is there any &#8220;latino clout&#8221; in Congress <i>at all</i>?</p>
<p>Pardon my obvious naivete, but I&rsquo;ve always had the quaint notion that the Congress of the United States was to be made up of and for <i>citizens</i> of the United (sic) States.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO)&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Call me when there&rsquo;s a National Association of <i>White</i> Elected and Appointed Officials (NAWEO), won&rsquo;t you, Gary Martin?  Until then, you have nothing useful to say.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;You are going to see regional differences. That will define these members, not just their ethnicities.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Yeah, si, senor.  Just like the Congressional Black Caucus.<br>

		<p>Congress will only become more ethnically Balkanized as time goes on.<br>
I&rsquo;m of the opinoin that people should only be allowed to vote for a person of their own race. That is the only way a race can be sure they are properly represented.</p>

		<p>If these Latinos are being elected from non-Latino majority areas it says the following:</p>
<p>1.  Unlike blacks who never venture far from the helping urban hand of whites or each other, these hispanic invaders are branching out throughout the country, including to areas where -only- by &#8216;social activism&rsquo; can they appeal to white voter bases.  This is an organized system of dispersion that makes it hard to isolate and/or form boundaries against them.  It reeks of Che Guevarist style _planned strategy_.</p>
<p>2.  Advocating for these white MVBs and then showing up in Congress as part of a &#8216;Hispanic Caucus&rsquo; should tell you right off that their loyalties were not just divided, but _false_, from the outset.  I believe a check of how liberalized and white guilted these &#8216;regions&rsquo; were will give you an idea of their political naivete` and also perhaps an indicator for how long their stay is apt to be without continued white support, both ways.</p>
<p>3.  As they become more socialized within their (deliberately, IMO, to sabotage the national legislature) Congressionally balkanistic racial organizations, it will be only human nature for them to be subsumed by the agenda of those whom they associate with, most frequently.  Or to be sabotaged by them (as an organized hispanic/latino voting base) if they don&rsquo;t toe the line.</p>
<p>Race trumps Party.  Race trumps Promises.  Race DOES NOT trump Economics.  But by the time the Mexicanization of America is noticeable like the spread of an infectious disease, with their birth rates and our warped immigration system, it will be too late.</p>
