<h1>Turkish Talent Turns Back on Netherlands</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Johan Huizinga, Radio Netherlands Worldwide, January 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The young people of the Netherlands&rsquo; ethnic Turkish community used to be a shining example of successful integration, but many are now turning their backs on Dutch society. Some of the more well-educated among them are even leaving the country to seek work in Turkey.</p>
<p>For years, Turkish migrants and their children were hailed as the success story of integration into Dutch society. They were entrepreneurial, set up their own companies and Turkish youths didn&rsquo;t cause trouble. As a result, government subsidies were earmarked for other migrant groups  &mdash;  which were more a source of problems  &mdash;  such as young Antilleans and Moroccans.</p>
<p>But things have changed, it seems. The country&rsquo;s official statistics bureau, Statistics Netherlands, recently said there is a growing problem with the integration of Dutch-Turkish youths. And now a group of Turkish professionals, including entrepreneurs and pedagogue Kadir Tas, have raised their concerns too, putting them down in an open letter, published in a national newspaper this week.</p>
<p><b>Safety net</b></p>
<p>The Turkish community in the Netherlands is close-knit and has always relied on its own social organisations. As a result, problems in this community have remained scarcely visible to outsiders.</p>
<p>However, Kadir Tas says, the Turkish social safety net is now disintegrating. This is partly because those who made up the first wave of migrants are ageing rapidly, and also because of a lack of funding and subsidies for the community&rsquo;s own organisations. So, young people of Turkish origin are having to do without the safety net. What&rsquo;s more, they now feel shut out of the labour market, too. Kadir Tas:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve noticed that discrimination has increased substantially in recent years. We are seeing that young people are not even being invited for job interviews.[.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] These young people hardly have any chance at all on the labour market.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><b>Language problems</b></p>
<p>The authors of the letter say they have tried to draw the attention of Dutch politicians to the problem, but so far without success. Tofik Dibi  &mdash;  integration spokesperson for the opposition Green Left party in parliament, and himself of Turkish origin  &mdash;  does not agree with the criticism. He says this issue is often discussed by politicians. He believes young members of his own community still have that enterprising spirit, but do lag behind when it comes to gaining the necessary language skills at school: </p>
<p><i>&#8220;For me this letter provides a reason to ask the minister once again to do more to tackle language problems&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The letter&rsquo;s authors also point out that young Dutch-Turks are becoming more and more susceptible to the ideas of radical Islam. But other experts say it&rsquo;s too early to draw conclusions like this. They argue that the kind of frustrations experienced by this particular group of young people only lead to radicalisation to a limited extent.</p>
<p><b>Off the rails</b></p>
<p>Professor Tijl Sunier of Amsterdam&rsquo;s Free University has studied Turkey and Islam in Europe for many years, and he sees the situation a little differently:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;We now have a generation that was born and bred in het Netherlands. But they are still regarded as outsiders who have to prove they are worth giving a proper place in society. I think that is a very serious problem [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] I know this from conversations with young people. They&rsquo;re wondering: what do I have to do to become accepted?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It is also seen as a bad sign that some well-educated young Dutch Turks are now looking to build their future in Turkey. While there is little in the way of exact or reliable figures, this does appear to be a growing problem. The fear is that if young well-educated Dutch Turks leave the Netherlands, there will be no-one left to set an example for other less well-educated Dutch Turks, who may then be even more likely to go off the rails.<br>

<p>A &#8220;bad sign?&#8221;  Tell us, what exactly does a <i>good</i> sign look like?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The fear is that if young well-educated Dutch Turks leave the Netherlands, there will be no-one left to set an example for other less well-educated Dutch Turks, who may then be even more likely to go off the rails.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;The fear?&#8221;  Who&rsquo;s afraid?  The average Dutchman in the street, or the multiculti liberal establishment?  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very simple way to sidestep this awful &#8220;fear&#8221;: simply deport them <i>all</i>.  Problem solved.<br>

		<p>Here we see the Law of the Abhorrent West at work. It is all our fault and we have to pay more jiziya, eh&hellip; taxes to help the festering victimhood of the immigrants.</p>
<p>For your information: a considerable group of Turkish immigrants in The Netherlands sends its children to Muslim boarding schools in Turkey. After coming back to the Dutch welfare state they start whining about problems of reintegrating in our country, the kids have forgotten the Dutch language etc. These people have no common sense. I wish they all went back.<br>
There is no impediment for returning home, since they all have a double nationality. However, our government is liberal even when the conservative party rules.<br>

<p>Actually it depends on where you are. Are you in Germany, there aren&rsquo;t many whites so brown Turks are the worst immigrants.<br>
But if you are in Belgium or Netherlands, there are so many blacks that people actually see blacks as worst immigrants.</p>
<p>A Belgium guy once commented at Germany&rsquo;s biggest Anti-Immigration Blog and said: <br>
&#8220;You guys shouldn&rsquo;t be so mad about Turks. We have here so many blacks and they behave in such an animally way that even the Turks are holding distance to them. Be happy you have the most intelligent immigrants from the Third world. It could be worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nonsense. The Turkish community is probably the least integrated community in the Netherlands. </p>

<p><br>
I&rsquo;d call that about the only HOPEFUL sign in this whole depressing situation: at least SOME of these people are voluntarily going back where they belong. </p>
<p>As for those lower-achieving Turks who remain in the Netherlands potentially &#8220;going off the rails&#8221;: if that&rsquo;s a real possibility then it is the responsibility of the Dutch government to safeguard its own people first by initiating a repatriation campaign to get 3rd World Muslims out of Holland (and every other European nation). </p>
<p>Those Turks who leave voluntarily should be applauded. Those who won&rsquo;t leave voluntarily should be induced to do so   &mdash;   at first with financial incentives. Those who refuse this &#8220;greenmail&#8221; offer should be made to understand that, once the fund for paid repatriation is depleted, they will be physically removed and deported without a penny. <br>

		<p>Laughing at the absurd spin of the article.</p>
<p>What it amounts to is admission that non-whites come to white countries for welfare and leave when the welfare is cut off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important information that the vast majority of whites would want used to put an end to non-white immigration.  End welfare = end non-white immigration + mass self-deportation of non-whites.</p>
<p>Great&hellip;.every white nation should implement this immediately.</p>

<p>This quote makes it seem like evil white racists are to blame for not giving jobs to the young Turks.  The problem is actually much bigger and affects almost all western nations now.</p>
<p>That problem is the dwindling numbers of whites and the jobs they can provide.  In many areas of the Netherlands (and London, and Paris and the U.S. and Toronto, etc) there are huge parts of the urban areas that are basically non-white territories, and they don&rsquo;t make big companies that employ thousands.  Instead they usually don&rsquo;t go beyond little grocery stores, restaurants and things like that.</p>
<p>30-40 years ago, in these kinds of areas there were still some white people and their factories that needed workers.  Now almost all big-time manufacturing has been &#8216;outsourced&rsquo; to Asia, and Europe and the U.S. cannot provide even enough jobs for home-grown citizens, let alone a flood of recent immigrants.</p>
<p>Another problem is that different races of immigrants don&rsquo;t really give jobs to each other.  In the Netherlands, Arab owned businesses are not going to hire Turks.  (Bad history between the groups.)  In London, Pakistanis are not going to hire Jamaicans (and vice versa).  In New York, Mexicans are not going to hire Koreans.  Greeks don&rsquo;t give jobs to Japanese.  And on and on and on.  The diversity fantasists don&rsquo;t realize this is the state of affairs out there.</p>
<p>The only neutral employer has been whites, and we&rsquo;ve been crowded out of so many places, and litigated against so badly by the rising non-whites, that we are not there anymore to give jobs to anyone!  </p>
<p>Heck, the whole point of the outsourcing was to evade the higher expenses of manufacturing in a country with huge taxes to support the kind of social welfare programs that attracted so many immigrants to begin with.  Ouch!  </p>
