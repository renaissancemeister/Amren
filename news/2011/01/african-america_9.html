<h1>African-American Leaders Unite Around Carol Moseley Braun for Mayor</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Chase and Kristen Schorsch, Chicago Tribune, January 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African-American political leaders rallied around former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun on Saturday as a unity candidate best qualified to be Chicago mayor, capping a holiday week of private negotiations that left her the only major black politician in the campaign.</p>
<p>Flanked by prominent black elected officials who dropped out and endorsed her bid, Braun told a crowd at the weekly Rainbow/PUSH Coalition meeting on the South Side that she has &#8220;the most credentials and the most qualifications and experience of all of the candidates running&#8221; to replace retiring Mayor Richard Daley.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Braun was lauded by state Sen. James Meeks and U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, both of whom dropped out of the race, as well as the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who held private meetings aimed at getting the major black contenders to unite to improve the chances of an African-American candidate winning the mayoral election.</p>
<p>&#8220;The realities are that when our community comes together, as the song says, ain&rsquo;t no stopping us now,&#8221; said Davis, who quit the race on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, just days after saying he was in it to win.</p>
<p>In a city where race and ethnicity still play major roles in local politics, the contest now features former Chicago Board of Education President Gery Chico and City Clerk Miguel del Valle as the only major Latino candidates facing off against Braun and former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel.</p>
<p>With four major candidates in the contest and a slew of unknowns who could still siphon votes, getting to the 50 percent plus one vote needed to win the Feb. 22 election outright could prove elusive for anyone. So the goal is to finish in the top two and force an April 5 runoff election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. King has got to be smiling on this day because we&rsquo;re getting the coalition together again,&#8221; Braun said, referring to Martin Luther King Jr. &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to bring black, white, brown, one side of town to the other, back together again to create jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson (Jesse Jackson), who was given credit for behind-the-scenes brokering that propelled Braun, said she &#8220;best addresses the coalition of conscience of a multiracial, multicultural coalition.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Braun&rsquo;s task is to consolidate support among voters who favored Davis and Meeks and get into her column many of the 30 percent of black voters who were undecided at the time of the poll. She also hopes to continue scooping up the financial support of black business leaders who began to move more in her direction after Meeks dropped out.</p>
<p>The strategy is similar to the one African-American leaders pursued in 1983, when Washington became mayor. Washington was the consensus candidate from the black community, and he won the Democratic primary with 37 percent of the vote after two white candidates split support. He then dispatched a Republican in the general election. Washington, however, had the support of lakefront liberal voters, and it is questionable whether those voters remain enchanted with Braun.</p>
<p>Washington built a multiracial coalition that carried him to re-election, but it fractured after his death. Daley was elected mayor in 1989 on the strength of white and Latino votes, but like Washington before him, he was able to reach beyond his core supporters by showing he cared about issues around the city while also sharing the power of contracts, jobs and infrastructure improvements with other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Many of the problems that fueled racial strife still persist, including troubled schools, crime, a poor job market, mostly segregated housing and neighborhoods, bleak city finances and a scramble for scarce resources.</p>
<p>The candidates seeking to replace Daley are expected to play down talk of racial politics yet still try to encourage their bases of support to come out in force.</p>

		<p>Did you see Jesse Jackson on CNN today?  He can barely speak the English language.  Good. Please put him on TV more often so we can see the failure of the afrovoodoo race to assimilate.</p>
<p>It does us good to see who White liberal elites holds in such high esteem. How much of race hustling scam artist would MLK be by now if he had been allowed to live and live out his true afrovoodoo nature?</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of huffing and puffing. Is there a Republican mayor of any major city in the country? Efforts at inclusion don&rsquo;t include everyone. When non-whites or the left have an advantage they press for a further advantage and yet still claim to be victims, bravely fighting the status quo and &#8216;bigotry&rsquo;. Funny how our country never seem to improve. Quite the opposite. </p>

		<p>In my town, a young recent white graduate, a kennedy type one could say, won a 5 or 6 candidate run-off to represent the democrat party in the next city council election. He was the only white in a heavily black district and was sure to a seat on city counsel being whoever represented the democratic party was almost certain to win. The Democratic party simply replaced him on the ticket with the next highest vote getter. Couldn&rsquo;t field a candidate &#8216;too inexperienced&rsquo; I suppose. </p>

<p>The mostly segregated housing and neighborhoods aren&rsquo;t a &#8220;problem,&#8221; they&rsquo;re the only thing holding Chicago together. Without a de-facto segregation like exists in the city, Chicago would become another Detroit.</p>
<p>And as for another black mayor, I don&rsquo;t see that happening anytime soon, if ever. Chicago already proved it wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;racist&#8221; when it elected a token black mayor in the form of Harold Washington, who now has a nice library named after him. Why would Chicago need to elect another black?</p>

		<p>Wait a minute&hellip;.!!!  Let&rsquo;s be a bit Machiavellian here. The Rahmster is a clever guy.  It&rsquo;s not likely, but there&rsquo;s a chance that he could alter the trajectory of Chicago&rsquo;s decline into the economic and social abyss.  Of course, the ultimate end (i.e., the Detroitification of Chicago) is demographically pre-ordained, but there&rsquo;s a chance the Rhamster could delay the inevitable. On the other hand (heh, heh&hellip;..), there&rsquo;s little doubt Carol Mosely Braun would accelerate the rate of decline and hasten the collapse of the most corrupt city in the most corrupt state in the Union. Not that it&rsquo;s needed, but one more example of the result of Dem &#8220;leadership&#8221; and ethnic politics is on-balance a plus.  Soooo&hellip;. I think there&rsquo;s ample reason to stand and cheer for Carol and hope her all the best.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Deal to cut out other black candidates so Braun can do better against white opponent.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are white people who hope she wins so they can see Chicago go the way of Detroit and N.O., as just two examples. <br>

		<p>Yes, Senator, go win the race and &#8220;create jobs.&#8221;  We need more black leaders with her experience and credentials to boost the private sector.  We need more ignorant Leftists to allocate resources and redirect taxes to pay for flat screens &amp; mal&rsquo; liquor.  And let&rsquo;s face it, the state of Illinois needs more public sector spending to solidify the bliss and harmony that the morally upright &amp; noble people of color bring to the racists and bigots who work half the year to support the perpetually indignant.</p>

<p>HH,<br>
They don&rsquo;t see it as a double standard but rather as a way of &#8220;fairing up&#8221; what they have been taught to perceive as decades of &#8220;unfairness&#8221;. <br>
Does anyone really think that when/if &#8220;Latinos&#8221; become the dominant force in the USA, that they&rsquo;ll continue to project solidarity with Blacks? Blacks don&rsquo;t have a clue about anything and especially what is in store for them when/ if this becomes a Latino dominated country. Mexicans are notoriously anti-Asian as well. They may very well be the most bigoted lot in the world.</p>
<p><br>
 I still believe that there&rsquo;s hope but we need to take certain steps that will require some &#8220;coglioni&#8221;:<br>
1. Every white family should not file a tax return for 2011-2012. They can&rsquo;t prosecute 100,000 + people.<br>
2. Stop any support for non- white owned businesses. Buy &#8221; White only&#8221;. This may be a hardship and require some research but consider it a survival skill.<br>
3. Withdraw all patronization of sports or entertainment that discriminates against Whites; by that I mean NFL/ Collegiate Football, NBA/ Collegiate Basketball and MLB/COllegiate Baseball teams that don&rsquo;t have a proportionate number of White players. Don&rsquo;t buy tickets to these events nor purchase &#8220;Sports packages&#8221; from Cable companies.<br>
4. Protest to your Cable provider that includes stations that you find offensive to White Americans e.g BET, Univisión, Telemundo etc. as part of your standard package.<br>
5. Boycott products of companies that produce commercials that portray White men as imbeciles and that portray inter-racial relationships between White women and Black males.<br>
6. Boycott TV &#8220;police&#8221; series that constantly portray only Whites as criminals and Blacks as the Police chiefs, the characters who rescue White women from White rapists, Judges, scientists, lawyers, Cardiac and Neuro-Surgeons etc..<br>
7. I watched an episode of America before Columbus on the History Channel the other evening and all it was was a diatribe against the evil Europeans, who were given credit for nothing good.<br>
 8. Exercise vigilance over what social curricula are being taught to your children in schools. Most parents today have no clue as to what goes on in their children&rsquo;s schools beyond the numbers in the kids&rsquo; report cards. Be especially wary of athletic related events such as the &#8220;kick-off the season&#8221; football event or Homecoming where the cheerleaders escort each of the players onto the field. The girls are predominantly White with a scattering of Asians (who for the most part don&rsquo;t really participate in this type of activity) and the &#8220;playahs&#8221; predominantly Black.</p>
<p>All these things will require some effort on our part since we&rsquo;ve been asleep at the switch for too long a time.</p>

		<p>If MLK were still alive, I&rsquo;d bet he would have been exposed by the point in his life and the whole &#8216;Civil Rights&rsquo; stuff would have been stopped dead in its tracks.  However, I think with Obama being president that all this pro-black, pro-hispanic, and anti-white nonsense might come to an end.  We can at least hope!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that Barack called on his fellow Blacks, three times by race, to defeat Whites in 2010 mid-terms.</p>
<p>Blacks obviously get it and have learned to set aside their personal differences, select a single unity candidate, and devote their collective resources to defeating Whites. Then, they even rally together to advance the goals of their race. </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t Whites get it? Any White who votes for a Democrat or a non-White is insane.</p>
