			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Goldman, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), January 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former CIA officer has been indicted on charges of disclosing national security secrets after being accused of leaking classified information about Iran to a New York Times reporter.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors charged Jeffrey Sterling with 10 counts related to improperly keeping and disclosing national security information.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sterling served on the Iranian desk at the CIA and handled Iranian spies who had defected to the United States. In Chapter 9 of the book &#8220;A Rogue Operation,&#8221; Risen detailed how a CIA officer mistakenly revealed the CIA&rsquo;s network in Iran in 2004.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the brief hearing in St. Louis, Sterling said little beyond answering yes-or-no questions. He appeared to move with great difficulty and limped as he approached the bench to address the judge. It wasn&rsquo;t clear why he appeared to be in pain.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sterling worked for the CIA from 1993 to 2002. His final posting was in New York beginning in 2002. According to the indictment, Sterling left the CIA an embittered man.</p>
<p>Sterling, who is black, filed a complaint against the CIA in 2000, claiming racial discrimination and later sued the agency unsuccessfully. He also submitted his memoirs to the CIA to be published and was extremely unhappy with the review process.</p>

		<p>I have heard his name before in connection to the WikiLeaks story, but this is the first I&rsquo;ve heard that he&rsquo;s black. Doesn&rsquo;t our media do a good job of obstructing that. Like anybody would be shocked. He was probably an affirmative action hire.</p>

		<p>CIA analysts are usually highly intelligent, dedicated workaholics.  The agency is a fantastic place to work <i><b>if you&rsquo;re a competent team player</b></i>.  This guy was probably in the top 1% of black intelligence, but he still couldn&rsquo;t hack it.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that the most intelligent Hispanics, American Indians, etc, are usually decent people who act more or less like their white co-workers and neighbors.  But the most intelligent blacks are usually filled with rage and bitterness, and are actually worse to work around than less intelligent blacks. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the smarter blacks are, the angrier they are.  I&rsquo;ve worked around a few smart blacks, and it seemed like they could act &#8220;normal&#8221; for a while, but then their anger would get the best of them and they&rsquo;d cause all sorts of problems intentionally.   The top 5% blacks are unstable loose cannons.  </p>
<p>Has anyone else noticed this?  Any idea why?  <br>

		<p>&#8220;Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people [blacks] are to be free. Nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them.&#8221;   &mdash;  Thomas Jefferson  Nuff said!!</p>

<p>As the &#8216;face&rsquo; of America gets increasingly non-white, you will continue to see such things.  </p>
<p>Like the Iranians can&rsquo;t figure out that a black guy might be a spy!  At least white guys can go undercover and look sort of like an Iranian, most of whom have white skin.  Some of our soldiers in Afghanistan have &#8216;gone local&rsquo; with the beards and such and they could pass for Afghans, who are also caucasoid.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in store for the future?  </p>
<p>A black ambassador to China?  A latino amerindian CIA station chief in Germany?  A transgendered korean state department official carrying on high level negotiations with the Venezualans? (Hey, diversity!)  A kurdish-american trade representative to Rwanda?</p>
<p>Already a lot of foreign exchange students are getting a shock when they come over here and instead of a nice white stable family hosting them, (their idea of what an &#8216;American&rsquo; is), they are picked up by a non-white family living in relatively rough neighborhoods.  I&rsquo;ve read shocking stories about this.</p>
<p>To be fair, what would an American high school or college kid think if she signed up to go to China to live with a hosting family, and she&rsquo;s picked up at the airport in Hong Kong by an African guy from Zimbabwe?  (There are over 100,000 Africans in China now).  She would be like, &#8220;This isn&rsquo;t what I signed up for.  I wanted to experience life in a Chinese family.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of the world has pretty much saw white people as the real americans, and any minorities as a side-distraction.  Now our &#8216;minorities&rsquo; are becoming majorities and the world will be like, &#8220;But we want to deal with the real americans.&#8221;  What a world it will be in 20 years!</p>

		<p>Some things here that are hard to understand-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Sterling served on the Iranian desk at the CIA and handled Iranian spies who had defected to the United States. In Chapter 9 of the book &#8220;A Rogue Operation,&#8221; Risen detailed how a CIA officer mistakenly revealed the CIA&rsquo;s network in Iran in 2004.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t make it clear whether this is backlash for Sterling&rsquo;s mishandling of recovered assets or his criticism of the process that caused them to have to be evacuated to begin with.  It certainly sounds personal rather than professional if it&rsquo;s being handled judicially, res publica.</p>
<p>OTOH, I think it could add a whole lot of &#8216;backfill details&rsquo; to some period difficulties.</p>
<p>Winter 2006-07 was about the timeframe the CIA announced that Bush II&rsquo;s beliefs about the Iranian Nuclear Threat were unfounded because all Iranian nuclear activities had been halted &#8216;several years earlier&rsquo;.</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/9AjK3</p>
<p>If they suddenly lost all confidence in a compromised Intel Network (in the wake of &#8216;no WMD in Iraq&rsquo;) with a Hawkish presidency pushing for strikes if not war, this could be a part of the reason why.</p>
<p>Now of course, we know that there are at least 5,000 centrifuges separating U235 from U238 as enriched fuel and so the reality is obvious: the Iranians are the real deal that Saddam never was.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t get, -at all-, is why this is being handled publically.  If you work for the CIA, you have about 5 added levels of NDA-or-your-life security constraint added to your entire existence.  This includes removal of all Constitutional protections.</p>
<p>And such limitations against disclosure are added to by the effects of extreme compartmentalization in that you are either &#8216;tame&rsquo;, as an in-house asset or &#8216;wild&rsquo;, as a field agent.  </p>
<p>There is little cross talk between the two divisions for obvious reasons as ongoing international activities are highly classified and details of source names and dated places are specifically kept generic, even from analysts brought in to look at raw product data.</p>
<p>So why was Sterling aware of what was happening if he was just a people handler?  Did an Iranian blather to him?  Why?  If he was an official debriefer, why didn&rsquo;t he realize the context sensitive nature of what he was being told?</p>
<p>Again, your entire LIFE is subject to restrictions when you join The Company, there is nothing that you can be told which is not confidential or above clearance restricted.  All because the more weight something has from multiple, even unintentional, sources, the more statistical merit it gains as counterespionage (wheat from chaff) forces.</p>
<p>If this is another matter of race protectionism for &#8216;disadvantaged minorities&rsquo;, at this level of international spookery, then we are truly finished as a society.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a bad cut and paste job of the complete news article.  Sterling is thought to have been the source of the information used by Risen in his book describing how a CIA officer screwed the pooch and gave away the CIA&rsquo;s Iranian network.  It&rsquo;s interesting that Sterling left the CIA in 2002, yet was able to provide information on the debacle which occurred in 2004.  How did he acquire that information, or is he thought to have provided background information and context?</p>
<p>Interesting site - thanks.</p>

		<p>The way that successive governments treat Ex Intelligence personnel in the U.S. is unnerving,to say the least. For Example a Public servant like William E Colby would have received public Honours if he worked for the British MI5 MI6,instead a man of infinite capacity was dragged before commissions and enquiries for doing his job well.This agent concerned is a disgruntled employee who wanted more as a singular entity,could not be a team player,and so pays out the institution by treachery The sort of witchunt that Colby had to withstand will continue as Minority groups pressure governments,in Australia for instance the Minority receive better treatment and more Govt handouts than the Majority ; and if a member of a Minority then succeeds to Gain ultimate power in Government,then you will see the ultimate ridiculousness come into their Decision Making process,as ingrained in their Psyche is the will to bring down their perceived superiors . This imbalance is evident in US politics in the Obama administration,as from far off it would appear to be a quasi socialist agenda that it seeks for the U.S. Letting nations that attack American values have a strong say in policy is the first step into a disastrous slide away from true Democratic process</p>

		<p>I was curious so I did a little more looking - Sterling is accused of giving Risen details of &#8220;Operation Merlin&#8221; in which he is supposed to have played an active role.  The mission was to give the Iranis flawed blueprints for nuclear weaponry but the Russian courier recruited to give the blueprints credibility noticed the flaws immediately and pointed them out to his CIA handlers.  That notwithstanding, the handlers sent him on his way.  He clued in the Iranis and the corrected plans are said to have accelerated Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program - the CIA denies this.</p>
<p>The part about blowing the covers off of all of the CIA&rsquo;s agents in Iran is separate from Sterling&rsquo;s information and makes tragic but interesting reading by itself - the perils of instant messaging in spades.</p>
