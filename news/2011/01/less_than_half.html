<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The nation&rsquo;s students are still struggling in science, with less than half considered proficient and just a tiny fraction showing the advanced skills that could lead to careers in science and technology, according to results from an exam released Tuesday.</p>
<p>Only 1 percent of fourth-grade and 12th-grade students, and 2 percent of eighth-graders scored in the highest group on the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal test known as the Nation&rsquo;s Report Card.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The results also show a stark achievement gap, with only 10 percent of black students proficient in science in the fourth grade, compared to 46 percent of whites. At the high school level, results were even more bleak, with 71 percent of black students scoring below the basic knowledge level, and just 4 percent proficient.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight percent of Hispanic 12th-grade students scored below basic, as did 21 percent of whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are really stunning and concerning numbers,&#8221; said Amy Wilkins, vice president for government affairs and communications at The Education Trust. She noted that minority and low-income students are the fastest growing parts of the youth population, making the need to increase their achievement levels all the more urgent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Twenty-four states had scores that were higher than the national average at fourth grade, and 25 had higher scores at eighth grade. The achievement gap was also more notable in certain states. In Mississippi, for example, 68 percent of black fourth grade students scored below basic, and just 4 percent were proficient.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Experts pointed to a variety of factors that likely contribute to the lackluster results.</p>
<p>Friedman said one unintended side effect of the No Child Left Behind law has been less emphasis on science, history, arts and other subjects in order to emphasize performance in math and reading.</p>
<p>Wilkins was skeptical of that explanation, noting that strong reading and math skills are the underpinnings for a strong science education as well. Schools that are doing well in reading and math are also doing well in science, she said.</p>

		<p>This is one of those disconnects of liberalism as currently practiced.   There are few things the advocate more than science education, except perhaps multicultural education.  And they don&rsquo;t see that creating the next generation of best and brightest will not result in a reduced score gap.</p>
<p>Other liberal contradictions are the attitude of blacks toward limousine issues like gays or environmentalism, and differential rape rates.</p>
<p>Amren is &#8220;a conservative publication&#8221; but I can here via wanting to resuscitate liberalism.  </p>

Athletic ability is related to race<br>

<p>No kidding.  This is true in every field   &mdash;   Only a small percentage of students show an advanced proficiency in a certain skill indicative of a profession at the highest level of that field as adults.  This paragraph I just quoted is as foolish as saying that &#8220;less than half of American young men who are high school students are proficient in football, and just a tiny fraction show an elite talent level that could lead to a career in the NFL.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As the nation&rsquo;s demographic changes advance, the situation can only get worse.  The higher the non-white percentage gets, the lower the test scores get.  Given that reality, what sense does it make to spend more money on education?  But wait!  A sure-fire way to raise test scores would be to change the types and subjects of tests.  Give tests in basketball proficiency or gang formation.  There must be other such areas that could be included.  Then test scores would surely increase.</p>

		<p>I feel sorry for teachers possibly being rated by the test scores of their students. Take an excellent teacher and fill the class with low-IQ students with no interest in the subject matter, and you have a perfect storm.  The &#8220;establishment&#8221; cannot accept the fact that minorities have a lower IQ which will make any teacher look incompetent.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;These are really stunning and concerning numbers,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>No one in the educational field should be stunned by these numbers. They&rsquo;ve been consistent for years.</p>

<p>Of course. It&rsquo;s just the legacy of the evil white Republican George Bush. Now the die has been cast and we&rsquo;ll never recover.</p>
<p>When &#8216;Race to the Top&rsquo; (did anyone else ever notice the double meaning for race in &#8216;Race to the Top&rsquo;?) doesn&rsquo;t pan out, I&rsquo;m sure it will be traced back to NCLB. You can count on it.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t look for the insane reactions to end. Excuse making comes from the whole political spectrum. Something so trivial as progress won&rsquo;t be traded for something as important as self-righteousness. </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve listened to right-wing radio in the past 2 weeks you&rsquo;ll know they&rsquo;ve been having an eargasm over the &#8220;Tiger Mom&#8221; excerpt in the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Tiger Mom&#8221; piece is conventional wisdom masquerading as bold thought.</p>
<p>Ask anyone to name the cause of Asian success and they&rsquo;ll tell you culture. Ask anyone to name the cause of black failure and they&rsquo;ll name discrimination/culture.</p>
<p>Both &#8220;Tiger Mom&#8221; and the piece above tell people what they want to believe and because they hide the elephant in the room: Intelligence.</p>
<p>Yes, parental pressure contributes to Asian success. So do the genes that give Asians a 5 pt. IQ advantage over whites, 15 over Hispanics and 20 over blacks. Please no ignorant blather about IQ tests being culturally biased  &mdash;   or please explain why ethnic groups have the same average IQ no matter in which nation they reside (genetic Japanese in Brazil, US or Japan all test the same).</p>
<p>The subtext of any apologist piece, that any group can equal the accomplishments of Whites/Asians in America is baloney.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t flood ourselves with millions of unassimilable third-worlders and expect them to perform as well as groups with a 15-20 pt. IQ advantage regardless of any extraordinary measures from parents or teachers.</p>

		<p>Science is the white man&rsquo;s voodoo.  Its been used to oppress people of color all over the world.  Blacks, Hispanics, (and women) have &#8220;other ways of knowing&#8221; and don&rsquo;t need white man science. Believe it or not this is actually the attitude of many public school &#8220;educators&#8221; throughout the country.  As the white population shrinks, we&rsquo;ll devolove into to third world status in a very short time.  Demography is destiny.   </p>

<p>Ahh yes!! But not to worry my fellow citizens, the USA will still remain a first world country. You see, all it&rsquo;s gonna take to change this reality is more testing, more blabbering about accountability, &#8216;merit&rsquo; pay, more firings of supposedly &#8216;bad&rsquo; teachers (who in fact usually have &#8216;bad&rsquo; students), classes on Saturday and during the summer and any other creative ideas our all-knowing elites can think of. In no way does this have to do with the fact that mestizos and blacks, on average, consistantly perform lower on standardized intelligence tests compared with whites. You see, IQ tests are culturally biased against certain minority groups (not Asians though!) and everyone&rsquo;s just a blank slate anyway. So someone with an IQ of 80 can just as easily become a rocket scientist or brain surgeon as someone with and IQ of 125!!!!!  nothing more to discuss.<br>

<p>Funny I should see this article today as my daughter took her 9th grade EOC exams today. They had from 8:15 to 12:15 to complete this final exam in advanced Science and she tells me they all were done in little over an hour. Guess what else they had in common? They were all white.

		<p>Poster #6 hit the nail on the head.  Everyone is blaming teachers these days and their unions.  The real fear that all us teachers have is exactley what you have described.  I can be the best teacher, but can lose my job any given year simply because my class is overfull of gangbangers, teen mothers, assorted emotionally disturbed freaks and low IQ simpletons.</p>

Gee, I wonder why this is.  Whenever the test scores come back it is almost comical watching the deep thinkers scratch their heads. <br>
 <br>
What&rsquo;s not funny about this is that they keep wasting the tax money of whites in futile efforts to bring those people up to white standards. <br>

		<p>IQ is a very dubious measure of a person&rsquo;s mental ability at best.</p>
<p>Consider Albert Einstein, who was estimated to have an IQ of about 160-180, and Kim Ung-yong, who is listed under the Guinness book of record for having the highest IQ at 210.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein showed no particular trait that we would associate with genius when he was young,though he did display a talent and passion for various disciplines. Yet his achievements in physics are so great that to list them would make my post at least three times as long as it already is.</p>
<p>In contrast Kim, displayed all the characteristics of genius as a small child. He could read four languages by the age of two, composed poetry and was a talented painter by the age of five and was a guest student at a Korean University from age 4, until he was invited by NASA to participate in their research programme at the age of 8. For 10 years he worked there, but returned at the age of 18, citing &#8220;loneliness&#8221;. Upon his decision to join a corporation as an engineer in Korea, his countrymen accused him of throwing away his talent.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.tinyurl.com/493jm6h" rel="nofollow">https://preview.tinyurl.com/493jm6h</a><br>
He states in this interview how &#8220;People think high IQ makes you omnipotent, but I have no musical talent nor athletic ability&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Kim is no doubt a person of high intellect, and is now a respected academic having published over 100 scientific papers, his achievements do not compare to Einstein&rsquo;s despite at least a 30 point IQ advantage. A person&rsquo;s IQ is determined by a test; one which cannot measure a person&rsquo;s potential as can be seen by these two very intelligent, but very different men.</p>
<p>The scores of minority students on any test can be improved with the parents of the children taking a more active role in their children&rsquo;s education. The problem isn&rsquo;t genetic, but cultural.</p>
<p>Finally, only 46% of White students are proficient? And more than one in five score below basic? I&rsquo;m not sure what qualifies as &#8220;proficient&#8221; by American standards, but I&rsquo;d say that children of all races could do a bit better, don&rsquo;t you agree?</p>

		<p>And just exactly how much interest do blacks show in science <i>outside</i> of school? </p>
<p>In a recent news story, we read about how, on Twitter, the term &ldquo;cookout&rdquo; was posted almost entirely by black users, while terms relating to science or world events like  &ldquo;oilspill&rdquo; were used almost uniformly by whites. </p>
<p>What percentage of subscriptions to science magazines are to blacks? How much interest do blacks show in science around the world? How much interest did blacks show in science in pre-colonial Africa? </p>
<p>You have to look at the entire, big picture, but of course, our nutty society refuses to do this. </p>

		<p>This is a story that not only won&rsquo;t go away, but will only get worse with each passing year since the percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the educational system is growing steadily. Students of European background must already be simply the largest minority group as far as First grade students nationwide, and so unless a sudden shift in demographics occurs, this country is doomed to become a Third World economy before too much longer based on racial reality alone.</p>
<p>I guess as long as the white elite and middle class have enough money to send their children to private schools they will continue to think that they can gain a privileged position in the society of the future, but lording it over mostly black or Hispanic masses will not work since politically they&rsquo;ll be voting for more social benefits that will further bankrupt a country that might as well already declare bankruptcy.         We are not far from what I call &#8220;the danger zone of politics&#8221; since the political middle is going to drop out at some point in the near future due to the economy&rsquo;s structural failures. At that point the educational failures of black and Hispanic students will not be the gut issue, but the very ability of the entire multi-racial society to function in one country will be in question.</p>

<p>That is complete nonsense.  Your argument is similar to saying:  &#8220;Speed and strength are very dubious measures of a person&rsquo;s athletic ability at best.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>This is a society of educated idiots. The psychopaths running the show do not know how to properly run a society, so they blame the peasants, and require them to get an education. (Most) of the people at the top in government and in the corporations are irresponsible and don&rsquo;t know how to hire a competent person for the job, so they require a 4 year college degree (B.A., or A.A). If the job still doesn&rsquo;t get done, they blame the schools for giving out diplomas to unqualified people. The next option is to raise the cost of tuition and books so very few people can afford to get a diploma. This will cause a lack of qualified people giving them an excuse to hire H1-B applicants (who don&rsquo;t know what they are doing). If that fails they will require either a Masters or PhD for the job. I don&rsquo;t think most people need anymore than a basic understanding of math and reading to survive in a properly functioning society. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and simple algebra is all that is needed to balance a check book and manage your finances. Spending time educating children who will not need or have use for any of the information is a waste of time and money. Schools main purpose is to corral, brainwash, and stifle creativity and individuality. The government creates too many false industries to create jobs, like education, law enforcement, and recycling. If people are already knowledgeable, require more knowledge. If people are obeying the law, create more laws they can break so they can be fined. If people already recycle, charge them CRV and a curbcycle fee anyways, then don&rsquo;t give them anywhere to turn in their bottles and cans for money. </p>
<p>&hellip;and the pattern continues to repeat itself over and over again.</p>

		<p>The nation&rsquo;s students ARE performing way below reguired and desired levels. I wouldn&rsquo;t categorize it as &#8216;struggling&rsquo;, though. Struggling would indicate an actual effort being made. And it is not the fault of the teachers (other than parents being in the position of being the child&rsquo;s first and most influencial teacher.)</p>
<p>It stuns me the number of &#8216;edumacated&rsquo; blacks AND whites who can&rsquo;t spell beyond a fifth grade level; who have no idea when NOT to use an apostrophe (plural does not mean  possessive), and the difference between they&rsquo;re, there and their, etc. If one is under-educated in spelling and grammar, you can assume they&rsquo;re also under-educated in most other subjects. We are one step away from illiteracy and ignorance. As usual, negative traits in whites are generally on steroids in blacks.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised they stated the racial breakdown of the scores, but not surprised at their deliberately obfuscative wording:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty-eight percent of Hispanic 12th-grade students scored below basic, as did 21 percent of whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;as did&#8221;? Presumably intending to imply that the white scores were in any way comparable to the Hispanic ones. And of course, they didn&rsquo;t even include the black scores in the same sentence! Nothing like being a liberal for making somebody into a censor of the truth.</p>

		<p>How could a student that&rsquo;s not doing well in math and reading be expected to do well on a science test? You must be able to read and understand a question in order to give a correct answer. </p>
<p>This is where our eductaional system is dropping the ball. Until a child can read and do basic math they should not be promoted and expected to catch up at a later date because it&rsquo;s not going to happen. A house must be built on a solid foundation. </p>
<p>If it takes ten years to teach a child to read at least something has been accomplished but it that same child spends ten years in classes that they don&rsquo;t understand then nothing has been accomplished. </p>

		<p>After I read this article, I felt the usual reaction of anger, resentment and resignation, especially since I&rsquo;d just received my 17-year old&rsquo;s PSAT scores.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p><i>The results also show a stark achievement gap, with only 10 percent of black students proficient in science&hellip; At the high school level&hellip; 71 percent of black students scored below the basic knowledge level, and just 4 percent proficient&hellip;Fifty-eight percent of Hispanic 12th-grade students scored below basic.</i></p>
<p>According to California&rsquo;s new state superintendent/political lackey Tom Torlakson:  <i>These scores are telling us - loud and clear - that it&rsquo;s time to expand science instruction and close the achievement gap!</i></p>
<p>TOTUS has called for <i>an all hands on deck approach and set a goal of recruiting 10,000 new science and math teachers over the next two years.</i></p>
<p>Even supreme educational idiot Arne Duncan chimed in:  <i>Our nation&rsquo;s long-term economic prosperity depends on providing a world class education to all students, especially in mathematics and science.</i></p>
<p>Where do you think all the government&rsquo;s efforts and trillions of fiat dollars will be concentrated?  On those with IQs of 87?   </p>
<p>Move to the Head of the Class!</p>
<p>Oh, and the PSAT scores?  My 17-year old refused to open the expensive PSAT/SAT test guides I&rsquo;d bought for him, refused to attend study sessions, refused any offers of test prep classes (cost:  $1500), refused to join weekend study groups composed of his peers.</p>
<p>He scored in the 95th percentile on math and even higher on the &#8220;Language Arts&#8221; and writing sections, 100% on many of the sub categories.</p>
<p>You can be sure no colleges or universities will be knocking down the front door offering him full rides, scholarships, offering to fly him great distances for a look-see, throwing money and offers at his feet, as they would if were black or hispanic.</p>
<p>You can also be sure his government school will offer him no recognition, no honors, no accolades, no special medals for high achievement (but they will take credit for &#8220;producing&#8221; high-scoring students without recognizing those students individually, because they&rsquo;re White OR Asian).</p>
<p>He will be offered no summer internships from NASA or any other science institute, no field trips to CalTech, not paired up with a science or engineering mentor, not offered any supplemental outside science or math programs that are brought in for black/hispanic schools. </p>
<p>Even with high test scores, 5s on APs such as Calculus and Physics, and a 4.5 GPA, I worry about my 17-year old getting into UCLA, let alone CalTech, MIT, Reed, Rice, or Mudd.  He&rsquo;s the wrong color, not wanted these days, because color/race/ethnicity trumps test scores, academic achievement and ability.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to look Torlakson and Duncan directly in the eyes and ask them about this, why high-scoring, high-potential White children are being &#8220;thrown under the bus.&#8221;  But, as the snakes that they are, they&rsquo;re just mumble something about <br>
Social Justice and equity.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this:</p>
<p>#6  &mdash;  Ken:</p>
<p><i>I feel sorry for teachers possibly being rated by the test scores of their students. Take an excellent teacher and fill the class with low-IQ students with no interest in the subject matter, and you have a perfect storm. The &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; cannot accept the fact that minorities have a lower IQ which will make any teacher look incompetent.</i></p>
<p>This is precisely why teachers are 100% against merit pay.  Even the best of teachers cannot overcome an IQ gap of 87 vs. 120+.</p>
<p>Thank you, friend, what you write makes more sense than any high-priced educational bureaucrat, government hack, ivory-tower pundit, state superintendent or school board president who continue to insist that IQ/focus and drive are irrelevant.</p>
<p>May:</p>
<p><i>The elements be kind to thee, and <br>
make thy spirits all of comfort.</i></p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p> <i>Trillions of dollars have been spent on programs to erase the gap between white and black academic achievements. All have failed. After each program fails, the egalitarian chattering classes get together to see what can be done about this Mysterious Gap. IQ differences are never mentioned, and another program costing even more money is started, only to fail several years down the road, and the Mysterious Gap remains, or even increases.</i></p>

		<p>To #15:  Kim Ung-yong is now a Professor of Civil Engineering at a Korean university.  As I understood it, he became tired of physics and got fascinated with bridges, dams, etc.  This makes me wonder if there is such a thing as &#8220;abstraction burnout&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ve seen similar happen with a number of MIT student whizzes as life goes on.  </p>
<p>Prof. Kim applies state-of-art mathematical and analysis techniques to civil-engineering problems.  He treats a very traditional field in a very creative way.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Prof. Kim&rsquo;s case undermines the IQ argument at all.  Perhaps his high-school-age loneliness drew him toward earthy and concrete things.  </p>

		<p>I was thinking about this article when I watched Obama&rsquo;s SOTU and the two less than stellar Republican and TEA responses.  (Yes, I said &#8220;less than stellar,&#8221; and that&rsquo;s an understatement on my part.)  Obama went on and on about &#8220;education&#8221; and &#8220;innovation&#8221; and the &#8220;glow-BULL economy.&#8221;  Trouble is, he&rsquo;s consigning a good percentage of the white population to perpetual poverty with that rhetoric and his proposals.  (So are too many Republicans.)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do some figuring.  Let&rsquo;s assume whites have a mean IQ of 100, a standard deviation of 15, the IQ distribution closely matches that of a perfect bell curve, there are 200 million whites in the U.S., and 75% are of working age.  This means that 51.2 million white people are of working age and have an IQ between 85 and 100.  Now, under the right circumstances (like the ones we had until recently, when we thought that manufacturing, heavy industry and organized labor were things to be revered and not outsourced to China), such white people could actually thrive and see their standard of living improved if they just dedicated themselves to their (&#8220;seemingly meaningless and mundane&#8221;) job(s) and obeyed the law relatively well.  But in this &#8220;glow-BULL&#8221; economy, such people have no chance.  I can assure you that not one of those 51.2 million people will invent a quantum computer for your desktop or pocket smartphone, interstellar manned travel or a cure for cancer.  That is the province of a very high IQ elite.  And in Obama&rsquo;s America, that&rsquo;s the only way white people can seem to have a good standard of living.  Otherwise, we&rsquo;re stuck eating smoked salmon on high speed bullet trains staffed with young talented illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, blacks with 85-100 IQ who act like they care and behave are fawned over with affirmative action offers and sinecures out the yin yang.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Although Kim is no doubt a person of high intellect, and is now a respected academic having published over 100 scientific papers, his achievements do not compare to Einstein&rsquo;s despite at least a 30 point IQ advantage. A person&rsquo;s IQ is determined by a test; one which cannot measure a person&rsquo;s potential as can be seen by these two very intelligent, but very different men.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand your argument.  You seem to acknowledge that IQ does determine intelligence, because both men had/have very high IQ&rsquo;s and both displayed vast intelligence in their lives.  Is your argument to say that intelligence doesn&rsquo;t matter, because very intelligent people can become lonely, like Dr. Ung Yong, and not feel completely fulfilled in their lives due to lack of a full, traditional childhood?  Because that doesn&rsquo;t negate the argument that IQ is important in determining a person&rsquo;s intellectual capacity, and that is what the whole argument on IQ is about (plus the correlation between race and IQ, of course).</p>
<p>And I can tell you that IQ most certainly does determine a person&rsquo;s rough intelligence.  My grandfather was a prominent pyschologist for most of his life, and must have conducted hundreds of IQ tests on patients at his mental hospital, and even on some freinds and relatives.  He certainly knew that IQ was not just another meaningless number, but that there is a tangible correlation between a person&rsquo;s Intelligent Quotient and their capacity for knowledge.</p>

<p>Blacks and most hispanics do not have the required genes for learning.</p>

<p>No amount of money, or &#8216;new, improved&rsquo; billion-dollar government programs have been able to close the Achievement Gap because the Gap is IQ-based and therefore intractable.  There is no evidence of any program succeeding in increasing IQ scores after children reach school.</p>
<p>This is educational money that has been stripped from honors programs, science labs and AP classes, things that serve and advantage Whites and Asians.</p>
<p>The egalitarian masters have blamed the achievement gap on any/all of the following:   White racism, White oppression, poverty, the legacy of slavery, lack of money, lack of self-esteem, incompetent teachers, wretched schools.</p>
<p>This is laughable and ignores reality.</p>

<p>The world is truly upside down when educational programs that benefit high achieving White and Asian children are eliminated in favor of blacks and hispanics with a limited capacity to achieve.</p>
<p>If that is not bigotry, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>

		<p>&#8220;That is complete nonsense. Your argument is similar to saying: &ldquo;Speed and strength are very dubious measures of a person&rsquo;s athletic ability at best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strength has visible applications and IS a reliable indicator of athletic ability. You can tell if someone is strong. IQ doesn&rsquo;t. IQ is merely a number assigned to someone after completing a test, and the score varies from test to test. Re-examine my example. Who has the greater mental ability; Einstein or Kim? Yet who has the higher IQ?</p>
<p>&#8220;Your statement is so illogical, that it makes me think that you are a mole.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m opposed to the idea of racial divides as a whole, so I suppose you could say I am; though of course, I have never made any pretense of my racial views. I stand by my argument; and you must pardon me for saying that not all moles are illogical, indeed the best ones aren&rsquo;t!</p>

		<p>To Poster # 29: Yes, what exactly is measured by &#8220;IQ&#8221; is debatable.  However, High IQ correlates strongly with nearly all measures of success, including, highest grade achieved (high school vs. Ph.D.), GPA, speed at completing college, profession (Physician vs. janitor), job performance, lifetime income, divorce, # traffic accidents, criminal convictions, lifespan,  health, and even national wealth &amp; standard of living. </p>
<p>Hence, although we may not know EXACTLY what IQ tests measure, they do measure something very, very important for predicting achievement and success. Africans score low on IQ tests, and Ashkenazi Jews score high on IQ tests. Blacks tend to fail, Jews tend to succeed.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, &#8220;IQ&#8221; (whatever it is), has a strong genetic component.  The children of high IQ parents usually have high IQ&rsquo;s, and the children of low IQ parents usually have low IQ&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>IQ is not meaningless.  IQ is a very strong predictor of one&rsquo;s ability to succeed in life.  IQ is real and inherited. </p>

		<p>From a previous poster; &#8220;I&rsquo;m opposed to the idea of racial divides as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may be opposed to the idea of racial divides, but molecular biology has clearly proven distinct and profound genetic (DNA) differences among the races.  These inherited genetic differences cause many phenotypic differences in mean morphology, physiology, life-history, and, yes, intelligence, among races.  We are way beyond debating the existence of distinct gene-based races   &mdash;   that was already proven in the early 1990&rsquo;s.  The exciting research now is identifying those specific genes that lead to enhanced athletic, intelligence, and disease-resistance characteristic of some individuals and races.  Scientists are currently doing that, and in 10 years, will be able to actually pin-point the specific genes that give one individual high disease-resistance or high IQ.  </p>
<p>Arguing that &#8220;race&#8221; does not exist is like arguing that the Earth is flat.</p>

		<p>To those who claim that the larger percentage of &#8220;non-whites&#8221; the lower the test scores and that people of color cannot do well due to low IQ, you need to google &#8220;Monta Vista High School&#8221; in Cupertino, CA. That school is 80 percent minority and has the highest test scores in the state. Many of the minority students are Asian-Indians who have skin color darker than Blacks. This is for those who claim that dark skin means violence and crime. Asian Indians are more conservative and law abiding than whites and have a much higher average SAT score in the U.S. than whites. If you want to start classifying as Black in order to meet the quotas in order to &#8220;eliminate&#8221; the achievement gap, I&rsquo;m all for it. I&rsquo;m black if you classify by skin color.</p>

Picking and choosing examples does not give any useful information about groups as a whole. Yes, some high IQ people do not do as well as their IQs would predict, and some low(er) IQ people do better. But the simple fact is that when comparing groups within society (such as races), IQ is an excellent predictor of relative economic success.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m opposed to the idea of racial divides as a whole&#8221;<br>
And that&rsquo;s the problem. You don&rsquo;t have facts or statistics that indicate that races are equal, on average, in intelligence, you&rsquo;re just opposed to the idea because wouldn&rsquo;t it be awful if races were unequal. The simple fact, again, is that the vast preponderance of data indicate that there are real, genetically determined differences between the races that account for at least a significant portion of the overall IQ gap between races. But because you are opposed to the very idea of differences between races, none of that matters. You have the blind faith of the fanatic, for whom evidence to the contrary of his chosen position is anathema. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re very wrong if you believe that blacks can increase I.Q. levels by having their parents take a more active role in their education.  Everything has been tried&hellip;and failed&hellip;.with them.</p>
<p>That I.Q. has its basis in genetics is irrefutable and has been proven many times; however, having said that, let me add that I.Q. tests ARE NOT a measure of a person&rsquo;s full ability.  There&rsquo;s more to the measure of intelligence than I.Q., but I.Q. weighs very heavily in determining intelligence.</p>
<p>Someday the missing factors in I.Q. tests will be developed and included.  Until then we don&rsquo;t really have a clear picture as to why some groups are successful and others are abysmal failures, like the I.Q.&rsquo;s of US blacks and Indians, which are purportedly to be 85 and 81, respectively, yet Indians, proportionately, have a far greater percentage of people who qualify in the professional fields and science as well, while the number of blacks is almost non-existent, if AA is discounted as it should be.</p>

		<p>Kim might have had a higher IQ than Einstein, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean Einstein was &#8220;less intelligent&#8221;, by any stretch of the imagination. He started out his career as a patent clerk in Switzerland, and was interested in physics as a &#8220;hobby&#8221;, initially. One thing led to another, of course, until Einstein promulgated his landmark Theory of Relativity, in 1905, at the age of 26.</p>
<p>Yet, Einstein was also quoted as saying that &#8220;The hardest thing to understand in the world, is the income tax&#8221;. He would have had problems in trying to understand the IRS federal income tax code.</p>
<p>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and John Stuart Mill also had high IQs. Goethe&rsquo;s was around 200, it&rsquo;s estimated, by modern day scientists, since the IQ test wasn&rsquo;t around in Goethe&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Chess champions also have high IQs, like Bobby Fischer and 19th century American chess champ, Paul Morphy.</p>

<p>The IQ gap between White and Black Americans has closed by between 5 to 6 points since the 1970s, according to a study done by Flynn. With greater effort applied to intellectual pursuits,m it will continue to close. Furthermore one of the studies often touted as a demonstration of the race gap, &#8220;IQ and Global Inequality&#8221; is quite unreliable. Not only does it overestimate the intelligence of the Chinese (by taking a test score in Shanghai and then revising it down a couple of points), it also doesn&rsquo;t take into account the effect malnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa would have on the region&rsquo;s IQ.</p>
