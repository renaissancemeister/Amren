			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail, January 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A high school has defended its decision to segregate students by race and gender.</p>
<p>The scheme, at McCaskey East High School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, separates black students from the rest of the school pupils, and then further breaks it down into black females and black males.</p>
<p>The separation is only for a short period  &mdash;  six minutes each day and 20 minutes twice a month  &mdash;  but it has drawn criticism for raising the spectre of racial segregation.</p>
<p>Today the school&rsquo;s principal defended the policy.</p>
<p>Bill Jimenez said the school noticed that black students were not performing as well as other students, and that research had shown that same-race classes with strong same-race role models led to better academic results.</p>
<p>Mr Jimenez admitted that no other students were divided by race at the school, but he added that academic data dictated the school take a different approach with its black students.</p>
<p>He told Lancasteronline.com: &#8216;One of the things we said when we did this was, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s look at the data, let&rsquo;s not run from it. Let&rsquo;s confront it and see what we can do about it&#8221;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The idea came from Angela Tilghman, an instructional coach at McCaskey East.</p>
<p>She said statistics had shown about a third of McCaskey&rsquo;s African-Americans scored proficient or advanced in reading on last year&rsquo;s Pennsylvania System of School Assessment tests, compared with 60 per cent of white students and 42 per cent of students overall.</p>
<p>In mathematics, only 27 per cent of black students scored proficient or advanced.</p>
<p>She said research had shown that grouping black students by gender with a strong role model could boost both academic achievement and self-esteem.</p>
<p>Some students, staff and parents were against the segregation, saying that it ran against everything the school stood for  &mdash;  with students from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>But it was something Mr Jimenez thought was worth trying.</p>
<p>In all segregated classes, mentors track their students&rsquo; grades, test scores and attendance.</p>
<p>One such mentor is Michael Mitchell, who hopes to inspire his black male students during their short daily meetings.</p>
<p>He said he often quoted the Reverend Martin Luther King, who said: &#8216;Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Mitchell recently used the quote when he found that some of his students were failing gym.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;They&rsquo;re all young. They&rsquo;re all strong. They&rsquo;re all athletic. But they&rsquo;re failing because they chose not to participate.</p>
<p>&#8216;That&rsquo;s an example of &#8220;conscientious stupidity&#8221;. You can do but you choose not to do. These are the things we need to get away from.&rsquo; <br/>

								<h2>Pennsylvania School Experiments With &lsquo;Segregation&rsquo;</h2>
						<p>A Pennsylvania high school says some students are separated by race, gender and language for a few minutes each day in an effort to boost academic scores, raising controversy over the historically contentious issue of segregation in schools. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Educators immediately noticed strong bonds being formed between all students and mentor teachers,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>The junior class at McCaskey East is voluntarily segregated by the students, who organize themselves &#8220;by gender, race and/or language,&#8221; said school spokeswoman Kelly Burkholder.</p>
<p>But some school experts say the experiment is misguided.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we talk about reducing the achievement gap, do we mean merely reducing the discrepancy of test scores of white students and students of color?&#8221; asked education consultant Sam Chaltain. &#8220;Or do we mean reducing the predictive impact that things like race, class and gender have on all aspects of student engagement, performance and learning?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But while McCaskey East students are &#8220;segregated&#8221; for six minutes each day and 20 minutes twice a month, some say other school systems in the country appear to be reverting to real segregation.</p>
<p>Last month, the NAACP held a three-day education summit in Raleigh, North Carolina, where the Wake County School Board, bolstered by the election of four new conservative members last year, ended the school system&rsquo;s 10-year-old diversity policy that used the number of students receiving free or reduced-price lunches to assign students to schools. </p>
<p>They plan to replace the policy with a &#8220;neighborhood schools system&#8221; that critics say will establish real segregation.</p>
<p>&#8220;School boards across this country are rolling the clock back to the time before Brown vs. the Board of Education,&#8221; NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said in a statement. &#8220;The NAACP will not let this happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But as educators look for new ways to improve student aptitude, some point out that McCaskey East High School could have the right idea. A national study from UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies claims to show that girls from single-sex schools have an edge over their co-ed peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Single-sex education appears to produce favorable outcomes for female students, especially in terms of their confidence, engagement and aspirations, most notably in areas related to math and science,&#8221; the 2008 study said.<br/>

		<p>It&rsquo;s long since time for the liberals to give up on their never ending quest to magically boost Black acheivement.<br/>
America was told that integration would boost achievement but it did&rsquo;nt work. Now we&rsquo;re told that segregation will boost achievement, but that was the situation for most of human history and Africans failed to create a viable civilization over tens of thousands of years. Now they can be sent to another classroom and fail on their own I suppose.</p>

		<p>L.L. Cool J once did a song called &#8220;Six Minutes of Pleasure.&#8221;  For the white students at this high school (under 20% of the total school population, from what I understand), the six minutes per school day they have the black students sequestered must be their most pleasurable.  No blacks around to harass them, hate them, yell slurs and obscenities at them, beat them up, and even if not for that, act as a drag on the pace of classroom instruction.  I bet those white students get more actual work and learning done in the 6min/day they&rsquo;re alone than most of the rest of the school does in aggregate for the whole week.</p>

		<p>Speaking again as a former progressive who used to mouth these grotesque, ridiculous lies just as fluently as anyone, I feel ethically compelled to remind your readership of a simple fact:</p>
<p>Everyone knows, everyone has always known, that people from preliterate societies (black Africa, the Americas, Australian aborigines, etc.) has a different natural history, do not have the same capacity to manipulate concepts, abstract thought, mathematical or linguistic symbols as Eurasians.</p>
<p>it is important to remember that anyone who says differently is deliberately AND CONSCIOUSLY LYING - even and ESPECIALLY!!!! when they become irate, hysterical, agitated, and threatening in order to intimidate their interlocutor into silence.</p>
<p>I was the same before I stopped drinking the Kool-Aid.</p>
<p>It is very important to remember AT ALL TIMES that these pathological liars (I used to be one, so I know what I&rsquo;m talking about) do NOT!!!! expect to &#8220;close the testing gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are simply engaging in the strange kabuki theater of race relations as prescribed by the current consensus, and paying their bills in the process.</p>
<p>The dilemma is simple:</p>
<p>1) It is utterly impossible for any sane person to believe that Africans have the same mental constitution as Europeans.</p>
<p>2) It is still politically impossible to speak the truth - the soft totalitarianism of race equality is still in force. </p>
<p>The only solution is for reputable scientists and educators, politicians and others to risk their reputations by speaking the truth.</p>
<p>The first few may be crushed by the system, but eventually, as more and more people come forward, it will be impossible to hide the truth.</p>
<p>The current system is so crazy and unstable that it cannot last forever.</p>
<p>Maybe it just needs a good push to go tottering over, collapsing into rubble??</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that no matter how much time passes and how much brainwashing is tried, the answer is inevitably segregation.</p>
<p>Another point I always bring up is that with anything men devise, there&rsquo;s always something good in it, even if it&rsquo;s set up to be bad, because men are imperfect. Even with segregation, there were bright spots such a Dunbar HS in Washington, DC. An excellent school by any standard. It came apart with the birth of integration.</p>

		<p>I would be very interested to know if there&rsquo;s been any studies on the blood pressure and stress levels of whites students when around blacks.  I went to school with a significant number of blacks, and my friends and I suffered from what I now believe to be a form of PTSD.  Being around blacks at school meant always being on guard and being wary.  I&rsquo;m sure that kind of stress results in higher blood pressure, more stress and probably a somewhat shortened lifespan.  </p>

		<p>The politically correct pathogens cannot get it through their thick skulls that there is a correlation between academic achievement and IQ.  Until they make that connection and design their instruction methodology accordingly, ALL students, black and white, will not be provided the level of instruction according to their ability level.</p>
<p>But, they will never admit to the differences in IQ.  To do so would mean that they admit that all those &#8220;racist&#8221; segregationists from the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s were correct.</p>
<p>White parents, if you are sending your child to a school that is more than about 20-25% black, you really, really need to think about what you are doing.</p>

		<p>The idea for these black, gender-segregated homeroom sessions came from a black woman.  She, another black woman, and two black men now head them.  The students are apparently responding well.  For instance, one boy agreed to stop wearing sacky pants.  Could whitey have gotten him to do that?</p>
<p>Lancaster, which is in Amish and Mennonite country, is only about 14% black, but it&rsquo;s over 30% Hispanic.  This school already had separate homerooms (and no doubt classes) for students of English non-proficiency.  The general area also has about 30 private schools, many run by Mennonites.  This probably tells you where most white students are.</p>

When schools enforce social experiments on students, all but the most gifted tend to fishtail toward the least performing.                                                      Racial seperation based on reconciliation and understanding is fundemental to the American way of life.<br/>
Including all levels of the workplace and military.<br/>
Africans never formulated a philosophy based on their own biology and only a tiny percentage perform in the top percentile acedemically.<br/>
True equality between blacks and whites would generally mean that a beneficial sub-tier of society will have to be created.<br/>
But more importantly, a philiosophy of thinking that Africa had never produced before.</p>

		<p>As long as black kids see it as &#8220;acting white&#8221; to get an education, they will always rank lowest. But I have a feeling that even if you segregate black kids and teach them only dumbed-down black history and culture courses, and they are taught by only black teachers, they will still get worse grades than Whites. They are a lost cause because they are their own worst enemy. No amount of social engineering or money thrown at the problem will ever change that.</p>

		<p>No other nation in the world subscribes to this diversity nonsense than Americans.  We will not survive economically if the Europeans, Russians, Chinese, Japanese and pretty much the whole rest of the world enourages their best and brightest to succeed while America spends billions on it&rsquo;s worst performers and rewards what little progress they do show.  Either we start pursuing excellence like we once did or they will bury us.</p>

<p>Racial integration has nothing to do with helping the less fortunate or those with less ability. The sole purpose for integration is to destroy the group of people that the sociopaths envy for their ability and hate the most; the white people. </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
I find it impossible to believe that segregating the black students for 6 minutes a day will make any difference to their academic performance.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The obvious assumption being that this is not an exercise to improve black performance but to justify the &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; of the backlash.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
I do know that segregating the black students for 6 hours a day would unequivocally improve the academic performance of the other students.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>That is not the test point and so any &#8216;disparate benefit&rsquo; theory can be safely ignored since equality means equal access to social benefits for minorities, not equal performance in achieving them.</p>
<p>Blacks have a spurious perception of themselves as &#8216;having made it&rsquo;, simply because their resented presence cannot be overtly rejected among whites.  They have no conscience of work ethic or the reality of sustainable SES through capability, entire generations having been raised under GS entitlements.</p>
<p>Thus, even the idea that whiteness will wash off onto them is alien to their thought processes.</p>
<p>Dominated by testosterone, their undeniable egos make it certain that &#8216;Just because I&rsquo;m here, I deserve to be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>All of Africa says otherwise.</p>
<p>Conversely, I am disappointed to see white females constantly tout the &#8216;benefits&rsquo; in competitiveness and self esteem when exposed to only other females.  For such is also not a fair-measure achievement index against white males whose competitive presence might otherwise cause them to enter into other career areas where their empathy and social intelligence could be better applied.</p>
<p>But it is a sure and certain furtherance of white, self inflicted, genocide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you compare the two case points (excluding one, mandating certain social &#8216;acceptability&rsquo; accommodations from another) that you see we still operate under Darwin&rsquo;s five laws.  And natural competition as a means to achieve selection is not and cannot ever be &#8216;fair&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Despite the fact that our city is about 70% white, the schools are probably 75 to 80% black. A couple of years ago the city tore down a perfectly good high school because a black city councilman demanded that the residents of his district &#8220;deserved&#8221; a new school, even though the existing school only needed minor repairs. The new school cost over $40,000,000. The old school could have been put in first class shape for less than $3,000,000. What was the result of this $37,000,000 of extra expenses on the taxpayers? Simply the WORST high school in the state. The new school is almost 100% black and ranks dead last in academic achievement and graduation rate among the hundreds of schools in the entire state.</p>
<p>At the same time, a local private academy bought an old middle school in a bad part of town for a few hundred thousand dollars. The parents repaired, painted, and landscaped it for free. This school by far is the best in the city and one of the best in the state.</p>
<p>When the city councilman was asked about this, he replied that more needed to be spent on education. That&rsquo;s why the kids of his district were such failures.</p>

		<p>You know what would be better?  Ontario, Canada used to &#8220;stream&#8221; high school students.  There were three levels of course, Advanced, General and Basic, and students chose which to take.</p>
<p>This means that the few intelligent black kids don&rsquo;t get dragged down, and the less intelligent whites and Asians don&rsquo;t drag down the smarter ones.</p>
<p>Nobody can yell &#8220;racist&#8221; - remember the kids select it themselves - but it essentially IS racial segregation.  Naturally, such a logical and fair system had to be abolished, and was.</p>

		<p>The NAACP knows that their black children generally benefit considerably from being among the better behaved (on average) and better performing (on average) White &amp; Asian students at the expense, of course, of the Asian &amp; Whites that they are not concerned with. They have tried to cover this scheme by absurdly claiming that the resulting &#8220;diversity&#8221; is beneficial to Whites &amp; Asians also but Whites &amp; Asians are tired of sacrificing their own and are starting to actually demand what is best for <i> their </i> children. Naturally the NAACP will make the phony cry of &#8220;racism&#8221; and run to Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;Justice&#8221; Department. </p>
<p>Whites &amp; Asians must have the courage to protect their own instead of letting them be used &amp; abused for the benefit of blacks. When this happens, it even will have the side effect of forcing the blacks to improve themselves on their own.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  - You know, I have always wondered how this works out.  I live in an area that is probably 90%+ white, Asian and Jewish, in that order, with hardly any blacks or latinos at all.  (Rapidly turning more asian each year.)  </p>

<p>But the local schools - all of them - are bursting at the seams with black and latino kids.  I mean, you never, ever see a white face in the crowds of students as they are coming or going.</p>
<p>  (One high school five blocks away is bursting with asians, then blacks and finally latinos, but still whites are so rare.  I guess it&rsquo;s because of all the hundreds of white people who live around here, like NONE of them have any children.  I mean none!)  </p>
<p>Of course I send my kids to a private school, where 80% of the students are white.  It&rsquo;s darned expensive too.  It&rsquo;s sad that I have to pay 20,000 a year so my kid can get the kind of education I got from a public school 20 years ago - for free!  </p>
<p>But I must protect my child from the joys of &#8216;diversity.&rsquo;  If you saw how the &#8216;diverse&rsquo; boys and girls around here behaved you would be horrified.</p>

		<p>I have a masters in teaching and fail to see how 6 minutes per day and 20 minutes 2x per month will do anything to help anybody.  </p>
<p>In the past they claimed black students did poorly because they were segregated.  Now they think they do poorly because they are integrated.  They have blamed the tests, the teachers, the administrators, the desks and blackboard for being racist and resulting in poor test scores among blacks.  The elephant in the room is that the black students have an average IQ of about 85 while the white students are at about 100 IQs.  This will never change. </p>

		<p>Six minutes is probably the maximum length of time any black will shut up, sit down and listen. If it works, just double it&hellip; and so on. On the other hand, if it doesn&rsquo;t work, just halve it&hellip; and so on. Then try the exact same experiment with an all-White class. </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s really astounding about all of this is how it is apparently driven by a dream.  We don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s dream exactly, but it absolutely requires racial equality, which is simply NOT possible.  Racial and cultural differences, often the product of centuries of habits, can&rsquo;t be homogenized by simply forcing people into identical circumstances and expecting the same results.  It&rsquo;s just not going to happen.<br/>
 <br/>
With that in mind, the very idea of continuing to force black kids to compete in school with academically-superior (proven, not an opinion) White, Asian and even Hispanic children.  This is a terrible disservice to the black kids and from an outside perspective would equal pure racism!  <br/>
 <br/>
This is because it forces educators to ignore the obvious differences and demand the black kids adapt on their own.  Since that is nearly impossible for any kid, it creates a lifetime of frustration that could be avoided entirely.  <br/>
 <br/>
Unfortunately it might mean we scuttle the current grading system and come up with standards that can better accommodate the clear differences in learning capability and necessary teaching methodology.  If these sessions are just another opportunity to &#8220;empower&#8221; black youth by telling them whitey is bad, then it&rsquo;s another useless program that will waste time, effort and likely money as well.<br/>
 <br/>
The real fallacy is the dream that black kids only need to be next to white kids to become smarter.  In practice the opposite happens.  The lessons have to be back tracked to accommodate the lowest element of the class.  Most of the time, like it or not, this lowest element in class is black.  So forcing them to perform on par with white kids borders on psychological abuse.  No wonder their popular culture seems so simple and dumbed down, all about frivolous landmarks of achievement and disposable relationships steeped in violence and false pride.<br/>
 <br/>
If we want to help black kids become independent we have to recognize that their educational needs are not the same as the white kids.  Once the dreamers can finally admit this we can start repairing an element of American culture that is quite frankly circling the drain right now.<br/>

<p>&#8221; White parents, if you are sending your child to a school that is more than about 20-25% black, you really, really need to think about what you are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have the right idea, but your numbers are way too high.  The tipping point is one or two black students per class, about 3 - 7 %.  After that, forget it.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #14: <i>No other nation in the world subscribes to this diversity nonsense than Americans. We will not survive economically if the Europeans, Russians, Chinese, Japanese and pretty much the whole rest of the world enourages their best and brightest to succeed while America spends billions on it&rsquo;s worst performers and rewards what little progress they do show. Either we start pursuing excellence like we once did or they will bury us.</i></p>
<p>Unfortunately you are wrong.  Great Britain, Canada, and Australia all accept the same diversity nonsense that America does.  Indeed, at times the disease seems much more virulent in Great Britain or Canada, perhaps because of their greater acceptance of statism.  This disease seems to afflict all English speaking majority white (at present) countries.  I don&rsquo;t know if the Germans, French, Italians, or Swedes are quite as horrid.  I hope not   &mdash;   I&rsquo;d like to think that just by learning another language I could escape to a country that has sane social policies.</p>

		<p>What do they think they can teach ANY high school kid in 6 minutes a day? It takes more than 6 minutes just to get them  settled down and ready to (maybe) listen to anything. This is somewhere past stupid.</p>

		<p>6 MINUTES??? Ha! It takes at least 20 minutes to get the black students to settle down and stop yelling! Ever been on a school bus loaded with black students? The High School students are frightening;the grade school students merely deafening! 6 minutes my butt! </p>

<p>Germany, France, Sweden (all of Scaninavia) is much worse actually. Not only do they force &#8220;diversity&#8221; down everyone&rsquo;s throats, it&rsquo;s actually a crime to complain about it. Also there are no laws protecting these Europeans against the horrifying violent crimes of the new residents.  Recently, an African immigrant in Sweden randomly murdered an elderly Swedish woman. He was sentenced to six months in prison. About a year ago in Germany, a Turkish and Greek teenager murdered an elderly man on the subway. He asked them to stop smoking&hellip;they murdered him. They received each a year sentence in a juvenile rehab facility. The list goes on. There are no real punishments in these countries for rape and murder. France has made some strides, but only symbolic ones. (no burques allowed and they deported 600 gypsies). Italy has made strides in fighting third world immigration&hellip;both policitally and in grass roots efforts. There is some intelligence there. The others are lost.</p>

		<p>#9 is right on the money.  I had to deal with that kind of long term stress and then a kind of PTSD that still makes me unhappy in what would, in the 1950s, be a pretty fun time.  For example, when taking my girlfriend to a movie I never feel comfortable when a posse of young black males walks in.  This is exacerbated by their inevitable rude self-centered behaviors (talking during the movie, aggressive posturing, etc).  I am so much on my guard that I cannot enjoy the movie.  So what should be a night of fun is a night of stress for me (which I try to hide from my date).</p>
