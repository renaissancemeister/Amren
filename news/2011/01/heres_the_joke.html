<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=250705">Here&rsquo;s the Joke That Got College Prof Fired</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fergus Hodgson, WorldNetDaily, January 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;A group of sociologists did a poll in Arizona about the new immigration law. Sixty percent said they were in favor, and 40 percent said, &#8216;No hablo English.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>That joke in class has Robert Engler, a 12-year sociology professor at Roosevelt University, fighting for his career.</p>
<p>It elicited two written complaints in the spring of 2010 as ethnically offensive, and what followed was a protracted argument that eventually included the termination of his employment from the fall semester.</p>
<p>Administrators have also discontinued his course &#8220;City and Citizenship,&#8221; previously a requirement for graduation.</p>
<p>Now his attorney, Doug Ibendahl, is about to file suit. Ibendahl believes university administrators are dragging their feet over a &#8220;harmless joke that would not be considered offensive by any reasonable standard.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officially, Engler&rsquo;s termination was for noncooperation with the harassment investigation, since he repeatedly chose not to attend meetings that would address the allegation.</p>
<p>Engler said he was willing to cooperate but the department refused to put the allegation in writing. When he brought legal counsel to an appeal meeting, university administrators immediately canceled it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the student newspaper wrote about the case months after his dismissal that he learned of the origin of the allegations, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t want to come to a meeting and be charged and not even know what it was,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now he worries that the unresolved harassment dispute will dissuade alternative employers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One student that filed a complaint, Cristina Solis, has spoken out, describing the outcome as fair and saying that she does not regret her decision to complain.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that is what it took to give him a reality check, and to make sure that no other student has to go through that, maybe it&rsquo;s for the best,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She believes the remarks were inappropriate for &#8220;a school like Roosevelt University, which is based on social justice.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Ha!  A pretty funny joke if you ask me.  I think I&rsquo;ll use it sometime.</p>
<p>I honestly can&rsquo;t believe he got in trouble for this.  It truly is embarrassing that, in a country such as America, you could be scrutinized for telling a joke in a college classroom.  I could understand not allowing a teacher to tell a lewd joke in a kindergarten classroom, but all of his students are adults.  Teachers in my school say lewd things all the time, and never get into trouble for it, so I don&rsquo;t see what the big deal is here.</p>

		<p>Funny joke. Was he smart for telling it in class? Probably not. Is telling such a joke a firing offense? Hell no!</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen profs and high school teachers who chase the girls in their classes get off with nothing more than a warning - and a stupid joke that really isn&rsquo;t even &#8220;racist&#8221; joke gets a guy fired? Crazy.</p>

		<p>Maybe this story should be filed under &#8220;Bizzarre Racism Charges.&#8221; That joke was so tame all it inspired from me was a yawn. It wasn&rsquo;t even really a joke about ethnicity but just about the language barrier.</p>
<p>I suspect what the complaining Hispanics were really upset about was the law in Arizona itself. They can do nothing about that, so they took out their frustration on the professor. In any event, this was a mean-spirited (and dare I even say &#8220;hateful&#8221;) act of vindictiveness towards someone merely for saying something they didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Are they upset over the NPR commentator over referring to whites using the G-word? Of course not. Even whites don&rsquo;t seem to be very upset over that.</p>
<p>I recall speculation in AR one time that one reason whites take the complaints of blacks out of all proportion to their seriousness is the loudness and vociferousness of blacks. For whites to complain the way blacks do, an infraction would have to be serious indeed, and so whites interpret the seriousness of black complaints as being much greater than it actually is. Perhaps Hispanics have adopted some of the tactics of blacks.</p>

		<p>Leftists never have to worry about being offensive&hellip; Material offensive to white christian men is part of the curriculum in the textbook. Being offensive to white men is a paper in search of an &#8216;A&rsquo;. This almost seems the purpose of a modern university. Years ago someone joked that the purpose of an education is to learn the proper attitude toward minorities and to have the means to get away from them. There&rsquo;s another half to the equation, though - the attitudes being taught at university about white men, and then the celebration. </p>

		<p>I have never heard of anything so ridiculous. I can&rsquo;t see how any Hispanic or Latino would find that offensive. If Cristina Solas feels good about getting someone fired over something this innocuous, and calls it fair, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be within ten miles of her. She&rsquo;s a racist or nut job or both. And yes, blacks and latinos can be some of the most racist people in this country, as we well know. I&rsquo;d hate to be the one stuck working with her. But then I&rsquo;m white. I&rsquo;m sure she would give anybody of a different ethnicity a pass.</p>
<p>It sounds like Prof. Engler has a good case. But who knows in this &#8220;politically correct&#8221; pool we&rsquo;re living in. Whites are not given the same protection under the law anymore. People of ethnicity can say anything they want to a white person and get away with it. If it&rsquo;s brown people committing a crime, big media does not follow up either. The university administrators would not put the allegation in writing? Everybody has the right to know who is accusing them of something. And when he brings his legal counsel to an appeal meeting, the administrators cancel it? Something smells very fishy.</p>
<p>I applaud Prof. Engler for filing suit. This blackmailing technique of &#8220;ethnically offensive&#8221; used against whites needs to stop. And bringing these people to court and making the judicial system treat whites with the same fairness shown to &#8220;ethnic&#8221; people is the only way. With the severity of the outcome for him-termination of his job-I hope he also files suit against Ms. Solis, if he hasn&rsquo;t already, along with the second complainant. Fooling around with somebody&rsquo;s livelihood is not something to be taken lightly. Solis&rsquo;s remarks show a total disregard for Prof. Engler.<br>

<p>I agree, with the caveat that they &#8220;used to&#8221; take them seriously. Few white people outside of the media really care about these complaints, especially after the Don Imus affair. The media is able to create an illusion, though, by covering protests, interviewing aggrieved activists, and so on, that it&rsquo;s important when it really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Even most liberal whites are pretending to be liberal so they don&rsquo;t get fired from their jobs. They feel powerless to be honest without losing everything. </p>

<p>How ironic. &#8220;social justice&#8221; indeed.</p>
<p>So HEARING a joke that you don&rsquo;t like is apparently as traumatic and personally damaging as losing one&rsquo;s livelihood, and possibly never working again, and therefore losing your house, possibly your marriage falling apart, etc.</p>
<p>I think the Marxists at the university are following this maxim:<br>
&#8220;Retribution should be totally out of proportion to the offence committed; the offence is rarely committed again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody can justify dismissing somebody from their post for something like this, unless they support totalitarianism (the ones doing the dismissing, I mean).</p>
<p>As soon as any white person makes the slightest &#8216;faux pas&rsquo; about a non-white, we are jumped on and our careers can be ended - because as soon as ONE white person &#8216;gets away&rsquo; with telling the TRUTH, millions of others will follow. This is exactly how totalitarianism works - terrorise everybody into submission, so that they don&rsquo;t stand up and fight back.</p>

		<p>You cannot underestimate the power of the people who &#8216;complain&rsquo; about &#8216;raciss&#8221; or &#8216;racismo&rsquo; jokes and good humor.  Time was, we could all tell &#8216;Pollock&rsquo; jokes or other ethnic jokes about other whites and no one really cared.  (Except for Italians, who never could take a joke.)</p>
<p>But jokes about things concerning non-whites, now that&rsquo;s something else.  The handlers and enablers of latinos are working OVERTIME to inculcate them with a sense of grievance and injustice.  I see this EVERY DAY where I&rsquo;m at.</p>
<p>All the things that blacks have been taught about how to stick it to whitey for even the smallest most innocent of things are being laid in front of latinos and they are scooping that stuff up.</p>
<p>One coworker, a white woman from a recent southern european immigrant background, mentioned to a group of latinos (in a training seminar about woman&rsquo;s issues) that if they were &#8216;undocumented&rsquo; and they did any sexual harrassment of a woman they could be deported.</p>
<p>Well, one of the latinos was angry about the mention of &#8216;deported&rsquo; and went to the latino woman who oversees our workplace and complained.  My coworker was dragged on the rug and is now in the crosshairs for firing, and she is so upset about it.</p>
<p>I was conducting a seminar about tax laws to a group of latinos, and they were angry that &#8216;undocumented&rsquo; workers must pay taxes but then do not get tax refunds.  When one young lady asked me forcefully to explain that, I innocently said, &#8220;Well, the gov isn&rsquo;t going to give you anything back because, well, you&rsquo;re not really supposed to be here in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw here angry look and instantly knew that if she complained to the latino administration I would be called on te rug, so I deftly made it into a joke, praised the upcoming Dream Act as a solution, and then changed the focus of the class real fast.  Whew!  Close call.</p>
<p>But the idea is that we can no longer speak freely or joke or even tell plain facts without the PC police on our heads.  Free discourse is dying in this country and a climate of fear, pushed mostly by the Left, has taken hold.  The funny thing is, they don&rsquo;t realize they are as capable of oppression and injustice as their Right wing opponents.  Be careful what you say, my friends, in the new Amerika.  Forums like this are our last refuge, until they too are gone.</p>

		<p>While private employers should be allowed to hire and fire people for any reason they see fit, this is very disturbing. Universities are  &mdash;  ironically  &mdash;  the most unfree places in America. When I was in college in one of the most conservative states in the &#8220;union&#8221;, nearly every professor I had routinely abused Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Christians (including myself), etc. There were two in particular who would even show sexually explicit movies the first ten minutes of class just for fun and give &#8220;alternative&#8221; sexual advice. Even though many women  &mdash;  many of them Mormon  &mdash;  were actually walk out of the class and complain to department chair&rsquo;s, etc., nothing ever happened. What are we to do?</p>

He said &#8220;university representatives insisted in meeting over the summer when I could not gather a defense, while I was engaged in other projects and not in Chicago.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now he worries that the unresolved harassment dispute will dissuade alternative employers. </p>
<p>In the termination letter, the department chairman, Michael Maly, expressed disappointment with the drawn-out process. However, he asserted that Engler brought the situation upon himself. </p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously we would have preferred to meet with you &hellip; we were very clear that you had an obligation to participate &hellip; we also explicitly advised you of the consequences for failing to fulfill your responsibility,&#8221; he said. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Sounds to me like Professor Engels ran away from a fight, hoping it would blow over.  It didn&rsquo;t and now it&rsquo;s more serious than it needed to be.  Litigation is indeed disgusting when you bring it on yourself because it makes it look like now you want an apology AND money.</p>
<p>OTOH, this department chair is the man who really needs firing.  ALL college students think they are MLK, Mahatma Ghandi and Che Guevara rolled into one.  That hyperconsciousness of self is all well and good, until it impinges on someone else&rsquo; right to an opinion and a solid wall of &#8216;by for and of the faculty&rsquo; would have put the little princess on her heels.</p>
<p>If the university staff circle the wagons and take no prisoners, usually it becomes apparent that this isn&rsquo;t mommy and daddy and you can&rsquo;t whine and mope and run tattling to the other parent to get your way.</p>
<p>It is a war.</p>
<p>And it is one which the faculty are obliged to win, for their own safety and the eventual good of the students.</p>
<p>Now (white on white, the browns win anyway&hellip;) Maly _must_ go so that the 1st Amendment can triumph, the rest of the University Staff understands who is important to retain the skills and good will of.  And the student body can see what Sea Lawyering your way through life gets you.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I hope that Mz. Solis is cordially invited to leave as well.  Preferrably by finding something in her transcripts which &#8216;through further evaluation&rsquo; is found to equate to too few credits to continue at the institution.</p>

<p>Well, aren&rsquo;t you the little totalitarian!  Ratting on your professor because he is White and then taking pride in your little revolutionary action.  Destroying this man&rsquo;s life and career mean nothing to you, only what you&rsquo;re told is &#8216;The Revolution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bill Ayers himself would be proud!  You&rsquo;re showing your brainwashing and indoctrination well and you should be proud of yourself for blindly obeying your masters, for believing the lies that Social Justice, as defined by Ayers, Obama and their heroes Che and Mao, is the road to utopia.</p>
<p>What you really are is a useful idiot playing a role carefully assigned to you, a role you do not have the capacity to understand.  Your eventual reward, as it was, is, and ever will be for all useful idiots now, forever and in perpetuity, will be a bullet in the back of the head, administered without prejudice.</p>
<p><i>&#8216;Social justice&rsquo; means that only white men may be offended by jokes.</i></p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding about that WR!</p>
<p>But, Social Justice is far more insidious and dangerous than that, especially to Native Born White Americans (with all due acknowledgement to Jupiter) at whom this so-called &#8216;justice&rsquo; is aimed.  Social Justice  = White Genocide.  </p>
<p>Social Justice, whose main proponent is the notorious Bill Ayers, is the theory that the government should control all facets of life and redistribute income in the name of equality, or as obama stated:  <i>To Spread around the wealth</i>.</p>
<p>It also teaches that non-Whites are victims of White American society, a society  that is racist, sexist and classist   &mdash;   and one that inherently discriminates against them.</p>
<p>It explicitly teaches non-Whites to dehumanize Whites.</p>
<p>Entire schools are now dedicated to Social Justice theory:</p>
<p>When Maxwell Kennedy, son of Robert and Ethel Kennedy dedicated the new $578 million luxury high school in Los Angeles he stated:  <i>This new K-12 learning center will educate and empower our young people and their parents to fight for economic and social justice.</i></p>
<p>And, from one of the new, non-White principals:   <i>A key component of this vision is to ensure that students move beyond an understanding of social justice and equality to a point of empowerment, where they become active participants in changing the world. To promote global citizenship.</i></p>
<p>Pseudo-revolutionaries like Bill Ayers well know that indoctrination must start early, be pervasive and relentless.  What the schools don&rsquo;t cover the media picks up via television.</p>
<p><i>Education is the motor-force of revolution.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Professor Bill Ayers </p>
<p>In a way, Bill Ayers is still throwing bombs; his mission to tear down &#8216;traditional&rsquo; America and replace it with an authoritarian/totalitarian/police-state government, one bereft of &#8216;Whiteness&rsquo; meaning White-Free.</p>
<p>And he is doing just that via his influence on ed Schools which consider his screed <i>To Teach: The Journey of a Teacher</i>  and the vile <i>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</i> as set-in-stone Bibles, as important as Mao&rsquo;s Little Red Book.</p>
<p><i>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen&hellip;</i></p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been on the fringes of academia for quite a while, and I can say truthfully that you are required to watch what you say constantly.  The least offensive joke can get you hauled before the head of the department.  I was an adjunct teaching freshman composition in Reno, Nevada, which is a relatively tolerant place  &mdash;  tolerant in a good way, they don&rsquo;t tar and feather conservatives, for the most part.  Anyhow, I had mentioned the John Birch society for some reason, probably historical context for a story or article we were discussing, and of course no one knew who the Birchers are/were.  I simply said something to the effect that they were a group that the mainstream media would consider slightly to the left of the K.  Of course, right when I said the name of that group, I happened to be looking at the &#8220;bassetball playa&#8221; side of the classroom.  None of them took offense, but one of their &#8220;entourage&#8221; of white girls went straight to the head of the English Dept. and I had to sit through a meeting with her.  The reaction I got was, basically, &#8220;I know you didn&rsquo;t say anything offensive, and only an idiot would take offense to this, but I don&rsquo;t want to have any more of these meetings  &mdash;  understand?&#8221;  An adjunct can be terminated at any time for any or no reason, so I pretty much learned to guard anything I said in class.  Of course, the liberal, tenured professors could make all the anatomy jokes they felt like in class without ever having to worry about getting fired.</p>

		<p>Yes, latinos and other minorities are learning from blacks how to keep whity under control. It works, that&rsquo;s why they do it. Blacks should sue these other non-white groups for copyright infringements:)  </p>
<p>Just another broad thought I have - wonder how long AR is going to be able to keep this blog online? I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not just whites reading these postings. Surely AR is going to get sued or shut down some day due to the &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; of it all. Any ethnic types reading this want to chime in?</p>

		<p>Our decades of social engineering, well meaning or not, as produced this disastrous and unstoppable outcome.</p>
<p>That girl who helped cause her teacher to loose his job thinks she is a hero to the most moral cause of our time. And all the media people, and &#8220;community organizers&#8221; who helped train her think they&rsquo;ve done a hero&rsquo;s job. </p>
<p>At best, all we&rsquo;ve done is switch yesterday&rsquo;s villains with today&rsquo;s victims. At worst, we&rsquo;ve created a new caste system with a new and more virulent form of racial bigotry that will last generations an destroy any chance the nation has to recover itself.  </p>

		<p>Cristina Solis uses the word &#8220;social&#8221; as a euphemism.<br>
The remarks WERE inappropriate for a school like Roosevelt University, which is based on SOCIALIST justice.<br>
Minorities can be absolutely vicious in their hatred of whites.  They will sometimes maliciously do everything they can to get a white man fired from his job, because of their anti-white racism, and if they succeed, they will be very happy to have done so.</p>

		<p>Given how absurd the charge seems, I suspect there is more to the story than we&rsquo;re being told. I consider myself a fairly left-leaning liberal, but this is ridiculous. Granted, it was a poor choice to tell this joke in a classroom setting (vs. after class with the inevitable lingering students), but as has been stated elsewhere, definitely not deserving of this punishment. There&rsquo;s almost certainly some other problem; the right seems to love playing the victim in cases like this, but the reality is a little bit more moderate.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, universities are instinctively defensive organizations in this country. They don&rsquo;t tolerate ruffled feathers from either the left or the right very often (remember CU Boulder&rsquo;s reaction to the piece written by Ward Churchill after 9/11?). Since this wouldn&rsquo;t ruffle any feathers on any of the most left-leaning individuals I know, and this decision to fire him almost certainly will shake up resentment on the right, there must be something left out by one side or another.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe not. This country is getting more absurd by the day, largely due to the extremists on both sides of the aisle stirring the pot. Some fine examples of such individuals can be found right here in this thread. That&rsquo;s not to say they&rsquo;re wrong in all cases, but it is a well-known reality that if you hunt for evidence to convince yourself of a strong belief, you&rsquo;ll find it. If one wishes to find evidence of left-leaning universities screwing over the white conservative Christian male, they can. Similarly, as weird as it may seem, if one wants to find evidence supporting this professor&rsquo;s firing, they can find that, too. The reality tends to lie somewhere in between. Hopefully the response by the university does as well, and the professor gets no more than a wrist slap when all is said and done.</p>

<p>Well, I always dwelled within the english department, and there were never any other conservatives there, lol.  Yeah, I once heard a lib english prof go off on some rant about sexual matters in a grad seminar, and when he was done, he smiled and said, &#8220;it&rsquo;s good to have tenure.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am appalled to read this! It&rsquo;s not that I disbelieve you, but I am just shocked.  Whatever became of standards?  Of civility?  Has everything gone down the drain?  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been many years since I&rsquo;ve sat in a classroom, and if this is really  the case, then apparently the country has been transformed even more than I had realized. In this wretched condition, is it even worth saving?</p>
