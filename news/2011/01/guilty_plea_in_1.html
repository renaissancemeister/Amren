			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Levi Pulkkinen, Seattle 911 (blog), January 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of two men charged in a West Seattle attack alleged to have been racially motivated has pleaded guilty to robbery and hate crime charges. </p>
<p>Pleading guilty as charged last month, Ahmed Mohamed, 23, told the court he and co-defendant Jonathan N. Baquiring attacked a West Seattle teen on May 25 because the youth was white. </p>
<p>&#8220;I along with Jonathan Baquiring robbed (the 16-year-old) by stealing items from his pockets while threatening to cap him, whipping him with his belt and burning him with cigarettes,&#8221; Mohamed told the court. &#8220;We also displayed a knife .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. held it to his neck and threatened to cut his throat. </p>
<p>&#8220;We targeted (him) because he was a different race than we are.&#8221;<br>

		<p>You have to feel for the newspaper. Print things like this, on odd occasions, and risk being treated as a virtual enemy by community activists and the smart people for spreading &#8216;hate&rsquo;, and likely see even greater levels of violence, or not print this kind of thing and lose even more readers noticing the gap between reality and it&rsquo;s representation in the newspaper. Unfortunately for the paper, the cities most vital and vibrant citizens don&rsquo;t often buy the newspaper. If it weren&rsquo;t for white liberals and generous advertising endowments they&rsquo;d go out of business completely. </p>

		<p>The name Ahmed Mohamed is Muslim.  There will no national reporting of this crime.  And even if there was, there would be no cries for justice from enraged Whites.  This is the situation that we are in.  We have an extremely biased media that selectively reports hate crimes and when that media does report non-White on White crime it is only a fleeting mention.  When the situation is reversed not only is the event given special attention, but the alleged wrongness of the act or acts are constantly mentioned and the police departments involved give that crime THEIR special attention.  Groups and organizations set up specifically to stand up for the rights of any non-White groups then get into the act and use their political clout to not only force the police to give it their special attention, but to charge and convict the perpetrators of a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whites on the other hand have been atomized and divided for a long time.  They cannot stand up for themselves in most cases because they are so afraid of appearing racist and many will not stand up for themselves due to a sense of so-called &#8220;strong individualism&#8221;, a sort of stand-on-your-own-two-feet mentality - which - during the frontier days of the U.S. was a great quality.  In 21st Century America though, this continued so-called individualism will be a death sentence for White people.  Time to wake up White people.</p>

		<p>Two men in their twenties against a single 16-year-old. Shame.<br>
Was he black or muslim or both?</p>
<p>Interesting that he pled guilty; they usually aren&rsquo;t even charged with a hate crime. Interesting, too, that any minority would be charged thus in that hotbed of leftism, Seattle. </p>

		<p>Male or no, the boy was a fool and underage to boot.</p>
<p>My dad would have beaten me within an inch of my life and grounded me until I was 18 or out of his house if he caught me out wandering the neighborhood at 2 in the morning at 16.</p>
<p>This is not an excuse for what those thugs did to him, I&rsquo;m sure -that- humiliation served well enough to reinforce the &#8216;teachable moment&rsquo; but _honestly people_ we are neither sheep nor bulletproof.</p>
<p>Our young men need to be taught some basic survival instincts as well as how to fight when called to.  Mexicans, Chinese and certainly Blacks -never heard- of the Marquis Of Queensbury Rules.  To them, chivalry and 1v1 is just how you make an easy mark.</p>
<p>And frankly, it appears our boys can&rsquo;t even fight that well.</p>
<p>Walk in groups.  Walk in the light.  And know the neighborhood you walk through so that if you have to confront a stranger, you know for sure going in that it&rsquo;s going to be a fight and can act accordingly from the outset to scare&rsquo;em off.  If it happens anyway, hurt to incapacitate or kill if you can win.  Run if you can&rsquo;t.  At least if they chase you around a corner, he who follows fastest will die first, using whatever weapons you can improvise to improve your leverage and inertia.</p>
<p>A change in odds and consequences to a fight, by itself, can make a difference.  Predators are naturally skittish.</p>

		<p>It would be nice to see the SPLC and other civil rights groups come to the aid of the victim and provide free legal help so that the victim can go after the attackers in civil court, hopefully getting a good financial settlement in the process.</p>

		<p>I agree with #4 Awakened. We whites need to develop a White identity to counteract the identity of nonwhites. Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians all have strong racial identities with their own kind. Whites, on the other hand, are taught to think as individuals. However, times have changed and now WE have to change. Then, a racial hate crime like the one mentioned in the article above would get national attention and elicit outrage from Whites across America</p>

		<p>These is an example of why I teach my son how to fight, when to fight, and when to run. And never to trust young black men, unless you know them well. Even if know them well, never trust them in groups and never when they have been drinking. He is only 15 but this would not have happened to him. He is too big, too fast and not naive enough for such predators. </p>
<p>Teach your children well or they might get killed. This boy was very lucky that they did not kill him. You do not want them hating other races and talking smack about them. But they need to be realistic about other races and cultures. They need to know that some will hate you on sight and will hurt or kill you if they can.</p>

<p>    They targeted him because he was white. do you think they would have targeted him if he had been Indian, Hispanic etc;<br>
 possible but doubtful.</p>

		<p>Unlike the 6 blacks who beat a white boy unconscious while trying to stomp him to death in Jena, Louisiana a few years ago, I doubt this victim will be receiving money from celebrity supporters, no rallies or protests against &#8220;racism&#8221;.  No appearances at an awards show to celebrate their actions, no press conference by the SPLC.  This boy learned the true definition of &#8220;white privilege.&#8221; </p>
