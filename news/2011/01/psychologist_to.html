<h1>Psychologist to Educators: Failure of Black Males to Graduate Not Your Fault</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Schultz, Palm Beach Post, January 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A noted psychologist told a gathering of teachers, school officials and parents that the reason why black males are struggling to graduate high school has very little to do with the failures of teachers.</p>
<p>It has much more to do with the failures of modern society, he said.</p>
<p>{snip} The symposium [on graduation rates at Atlantic Community High School] was the second meeting of a task force started by the school district to generate ideas to improve graduation rates, particularly among black males.</p>
<p>The graduation rate for Palm Beach County black males is about 65 percent, far behind the nearly 82 percent districtwide rate, according to a letter from Superintendent Art Johnson in the symposium program.</p>
<p>Akbar {snip} He pointed to poverty and the high number of black children born to young, single mothers as larger causes for graduation rate problems.</p>
<p>He also said that many of the children in school now were born into families devastated by the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the crack babies, and some of them the crack grandbabies, who you are now trying to educate,&#8221; Akbar said.</p>
<p>Akbar said children are &#8220;miseducated&#8221; before they even get to the classroom because they now get their socialization and image of how they are supposed to act from television instead of their families and communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Black Entertainment Television] becomes the model of how you want to be,&#8221; Akbar said. &#8220;You want to be a clown. You want to be a pimp.&#8221;</p>
<p>An important thing that could be done to improve graduation rates, Johnson told the crowd, is to find ways to remove negative social stereotypes that hold minority students back.</p>

<i>&#8220;Johnson told the crowd, is to find ways to remove negative social stereotypes that hold minority students back.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Blacks demand that the media show them as authentically blacks. When they are shown as they are, they scream that the images are stereotypes. As I always say, blacks are a stereotype.</p>
<p>Did blacks create the stereotype or did the stereotype create blacks who act as stereotypes? It&rsquo;s the former.</p>
<p>On a side note, I&rsquo;ve often said I listen to local black talk radio. One black talk show host claims that the reason for black pathology is that blacks have been and are being &#8216;Europeanized&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s been pushing this theory but I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s going to pick up on it.</p>
<p>I would love to call and discuss this with him but he&rsquo;s just like Chris Matthews. As so as the caller makes a point he doesn&rsquo;t want to hear, he begins talking over the caller. They try to get their point across but he just says, &#8216;I&rsquo;m gonna correct you if I think you&rsquo;re wrong&rsquo;. How&rsquo;s that for an exchange of ideas?</p>

<p>Sorry, Mr. Noted Psychologist.  Stereotypes don&rsquo;t create people   &mdash;   people create stereotypes.  And eliminating BET isn&rsquo;t going to turn Quantell and Kateesha into Ozzie and Harriet.</p>

		<p>So&hellip;&hellip;he comes close to identifying the real cause of black failure, but then skates away from it and blames NOT their behavior, but &#8220;negative stereotypes that hold them back&#8221;.  In other words, as usual, it is NEVER to be said that it&rsquo;s a personal failure of the black man, but always due to some other cause.  Did MTV hold a gun to the head of each and every failing black and FORCE them to act like clowns and pimps?  Or is it more the case that MTV and BET portray blacks in that light, because blacks LIKE seeing themselves in that light, and it&rsquo;s merely entertainment reflecting reality, and what sells.  Get all those blacks on MTV and BET acting like responsible White Men, and both  BET and MTV would quickly go into bankruptcy.  What bothers me much more?<br>
That stupid WHITE kids emulate the clownish and black pimp culture.  We all know that blacks will never change, and don&rsquo;t want to.  But every stupid white kid we see that acts like blacks should be slapped upside the head and given a lecture.</p>

<p>Because of affirmative action any black male who stays in high school will graduate.  He just has to show up.  That&rsquo;s why a high school diploma in black hands is no more than a worthless piece of paper&hellip;for the most part&hellip;. denoting only that the recipient showed up for class most of the time.</p>
<p>Did you notice that this article is like all the other ones written by blacks or apologists for blacks in that they blame everything and everybody for black male failure except for the black male himself and his obvious below average ability to learn and understand?</p>
<p>Will this ever end?</p>

Remove negative social stereotypes? That would require nothing less than the complete eradication of hip-hop, as well as every ghetto-centric movie and TV show. </p>
<p>Try telling D&rsquo;Arnell and Ty&rsquo;quisha that ALL their favorite entertainment is now off-limits because it&rsquo;s bad for them. You go tell them that, Akbar. And do let us know their reply&hellip; assuming you&rsquo;re still alive, that is. </p>

		<p>I have often wondered why so many blacks no matter what their educational level act like total fools? The way so many dress like 12 year old children when they are 45. The ebo jive they call a language hundreds of years after arriving in America.<br>
The noise so many call music filled with the filthiest of comments with most directed toward females (who never seem the least bit offended) by the absolute junk directed their way. Of course this is black culture and isnt meant to offend, only whites can Offend Anyone. I was reading about the black woman who lied to get her kids into a better school (have you ever noticed Better School always means mostly white students?) I don&rsquo;t blame her she wants her kids away from all the White Gangs and Gangsters, oh wait a minute they arent white are they?</p>

<p>The solution to that is to say it&rsquo;s &#8216;culture&rsquo;. Then again, aren&rsquo;t we playing the very game they have set up us? Only being concerned with African Americans to the exclusion of anything and all else? I do kind of favor the culture theory, myself. Was watching a fictional TV show the other day and one of the characters on the show thought these things were all about culture too. Turns out that was just another &#8216;racist&rsquo; belief, too, and the character on the show just another racist. It&rsquo;s probably only racism, however, if whites hold that belief. The only constant seems to be if you&rsquo;re white you&rsquo;re racist no matter what. </p>

		<p>Seems like there are three kinds of poor-trash background personalities you have to be willing to provide a life-out scenario model to, whatever their ethnicity:</p>
<p>1.  The kind who will not be schooled or disciplined that hate the world and/or want it delivered in 30 minutes, like Pizza Hut.  Sterilize them, find them an apartment with food service delivered to a cafeteria environment twice a day and give them a TV large enough to give them every cable channel known.  Including BET.  At 15,000 dollars a year, I&rsquo;m sure there is a company somewhere who would take care of these people, within a 1,000 unit complex contract.</p>
<p>2.  Will Work, no brains.<br>
A triumph in a land where there are many who won&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t have an excuse not to.  Find these people the best vocational training you can.  Get them out into the workforce and help them out with a free or much reduced condo and further &#8216;incentivize&rsquo; them with added cash or property perks for delayed children and early sterilization (1-2 kids, then it becomes mandatory).  Say 20,000 dollars worth of &#8216;assistance&rsquo; over 3-4 issuance periods based on plateau achievements (five years in the same job).</p>
<p>3.  Will Work, have brains.<br>
Especially if they are kids, get them out of their pestilential social conditions IMMEDIATELY!  And into a saturation learning system with people of their own skin color and a similar will as aptitude to git&rsquo;er dun in making their way through a college degree system based on merit.  These are the kinds of people that a 3 kid household and a special Fanny/Freddy loan system was made for because they are the ones whose population fraction you want to encourage to grow.  Give them say 50,000 dollars worth of loans or credits, based on GPA and job placement/employment rates.  The only condition is that they have to accept positions within their community when they are done, they cannot expect to move in on another ethnicity which is richer or smarter.</p>
<p>The tragedy of course is the hump who needs 15,000 dollars a year to look at the four walls of their deluxe prison cell (and be confined to it, as a walled in general area) for 15-20 years is still going to consume well over 175,000 dollars per person.  But the triumph is that we didn&rsquo;t -choose- to put them there.  They did.  And when they are done, so are their genes.</p>
<p>You can also make the presentation of that environment, as a new kind of &#8216;project&rsquo; where tenants didn&rsquo;t have to pretend to be shy about who they were and when they planned to change their lifestatus &#8216;if only someone would help me with a free Escalade!&rsquo;.  I think it would be a remarkable life lesson to the rest of us and possibly even unite us around a concept of &#8216;for the wise, the world&rsquo; as a recognition of what a lack of cultural abasement could do to lift us up.</p>
<p>I know this seems like the wrong thing to do, giving handouts to those not likely to be of our race.  But I look at -white-, educated, idiots planning to spend 127 million per unit over a 20 year time period of buying 1,000 F-35 fighter planes that will be obsolescent on service entry and I realize that I have no fear of a foreign power so great as that which lives across the street from me and sells drugs at all hours of the day and night.</p>
<p>For 127 million dollars per lost unit cost, we can, collectively, make segregation a lot more pallateable, to a lot more people.  Just by being realistic about which of the above groups each individual belongs to.</p>

		<p>Dr. Na&rsquo;im Akbar, born Luther Weems, ignores the fact that public schools have little interest in educating. The goals of America&rsquo;s edumicationalists is to advance the liberal agenda and political correctness, to instill alligence to the New World Order, and to destroy Western culture. The edamicationalistas have no interest in the mental developement of black males, but they do endevor to destroy the mental capacity of white males. </p>

<p>BET and MTV would go into bankruptcy immediately if cable companies allowed subscribers to pick and choose which channels they&rsquo;d like on their line-up.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, BET and MTV are part of any basic cable service meaning EVERYONE who gets cable is required to pay for and support these two vile channels.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a more interesting take on this general subject from the blog <i>Gucci Little Piggy</i>.  I&rsquo;ve said here before that blacks serve as the stormtroopers of the left, and that explains their bad behavior as much as biology does:</p>
<p><i>Brawling Blacks</i></p>
<p>This is further evidence of the negative affects of white guilt.  With white guilt and political correctness, people with moral standing became hamstrung in their ability to criticize minorities.  This is all a part of &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Judge Me&rdquo; culture.  A judgment from a well-behaved white person was considered a manifestation of evil whiteness, and judgment from another black person was merely an extension of the same thing – coming from the mouth of an Uncle Tom.  Since the criticism and judgment was coming from outside the black community, it was easy to rebel against it.  Criticism only has merit and effect when the person being criticized is forced to admit that they do behave poorly.  For blacks, they were given a free pass to just disregard any judgment from the outside, but badly-behaved whites didn&rsquo;t have that privilege.  They were held accountable and they weren&rsquo;t able to cite the racism bogeyman to excuse their poor behavior.  This keeps a lid on whites&rsquo; bad behavior, but allows that of blacks to flourish unchecked.</p>

		<p>the goal for most blacks should be to train in useful trades and start working around age 15 or so, because vast majority are wholly incapable of benefiting from an academic style education.</p>
<p>speaking as a lifelong progressive, I would have to say that the great society programs and their successors have basically succeeded in sorting African-Americans into two categories:</p>
<p>first, there is the &#8220;talented 10th&#8221; who have entered middle-class life, and second, the shockingly untalented 8 or 9/10ths, who continue to languish in dysfunction.</p>
<p>any black who is moderately intelligent and even vaguely interested in success will float effortlessly into a middle-class existence for the simple reason that all across America, hundreds of thousands of employers (universities, hospitals, government agencies, police departments, schools, etc. etc. etc.) are desperately trying to fill their quotas, and will drop their performance standards to avoid lawsuits.</p>
<p>the present catastrophe was caused by a combination of <br>
1) the disappearance of the working-class jobs traditionally occupied by blacks, <br>
2) the raising of false expectations (is an act of pure evil brainwash black children with IQs around 80 that they can become doctors, lawyers, and scientists, or even schoolteachers and policeman) and <br>
3) the abandonment of standards of behavior that have led to glamourizing black dysfunction and criminality. </p>
<p>the blacks who are then left behind by the rising tide of affirmative action, disparate impact legislation, fake university programs, and an almost infinite number of government jobs are probably unable to function in any modern society except in relatively menial and undemanding occupations.</p>
<p>this is not to blame them, or even to label them as deficient:<br>
there is simply an evolutionary mismatch between African blacks (actually between the members of any preliterate society) and modern societies. </p>
<p>the basic challenge facing most blacks in modern societies is disastrously low levels of cognitive ability (by European standards, of course: that may have extraordinary abilities that were adaptive in tribal Africa, but which are dysfunctional in modern settings).</p>
<p>In defense of the great society programs, it was necessary to root out racism and create opportunity for blacks before their maladaption to modern society could become inescapably obvious.</p>

		<p>So this is why South African Apàrtheid was correct after all?   Give the African Americans three States for their own and they must live there, no assistance by other States or the Federal Govt. other than normal is the pay adequate federal taxes.</p>
<p>So many AAs want this and it will give them the chance to prove they are able to survive on their own.  In fact there is/was an organisation demanding just this.  Afrika Rising.</p>

		<p>If blacks are complaining about being Europeanized (referring to sbuffalonative&rsquo;s post), then maybe they should go back to Africa where that won&rsquo;t be an issue.</p>

		<p>In high school, mid 60&rsquo;s, our Civics teacher was trying to show us how hurtful and baseless Black streotypes were.  I was not alone in the class in not knowing even one of the stereotypes.<br>
Two that were thrown out in the class discussion were laziness and the cadillac parked in front of shack. Of course there was no mention of violence, criminality or promiscuity.  There was a general consensus that Blacks would show, in our enlightened age,<br>
that the old stereotypes were just untrue, through becoming mainstream citizens and actively avoiding such associations.</p>
<p>We all saw what happened.  The social changes of the ensuing decades simply allowed them to act naturally, which has revealed itself to be far worse than the old stereotypes.</p>

		<p><i>was the second meeting of a task force started by the school district to generate ideas to improve graduation rates, particularly among black males.</i></p>
<p>Noted psychologist Akbar is not being honest with his audience.</p>
<p>If he were, he would call for higher drop-out rates for blacks.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest here:  Given that average black IQ is 85, and all research and hard evidence certainly indicates that this number is correct,  and, given that IQ is intractable and all efforts to raise it have failed, the question should instead be this:</p>
<p>How much academic achievement can we expect from those with average IQs of 85?</p>
<p>Does anyone really believe that those on the left side of the bell curve can be made into planetary scientists or astro-geophysicists?   Do you think Bill Gates REALLY believes this (as he keeps insisting)?</p>
<p>Is it not utter torture to the educational system and embarrassing and painful for those who do not possess the genes for learning to pretend that they can achieve as well as those with 35+ more IQ pts. and brains ~ one to five cubic inches larger?</p>
<p>And, given that blacks display far more psychopathic qualities than other races, their aberrant behavior disrupting and tearing apart schools, shouldn&rsquo;t blacks&rsquo; educational careers end much sooner than high school?  Should they not be allowed to drop out when their capacity to learn has been reached?  </p>
<p>Around the third grade?</p>
<p>If Akbar were being truthful, this is what he would be saying instead of the old laughable excuses that &#8216;it&rsquo;s societies&rsquo; fault!  &#8216;Blame crack cocaine!&rsquo;  &#8216;Blame poverty!&rsquo;  If Akbar were a &#8216;notable&rsquo; psychologist, and more importantly, if he were honest, he would be expounding on reasonable solutions instead of calling for yet another trillion-dollar program aimed at raising black achievement.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s asking for is more money to be transferred to the black community from White taxpayers, in the name of Social Justice, of course.</p>

		<p>As someone who was born before the civil rights revolution, I have to wonder whether most blacks were happier before that time  &mdash;  when they were not pressured toward white-level achievement.  The Cosby-show model never took off among the vast majority of blacks, partly because they simply could not attain it and partly because they simply did not want to do so.  For decades, blacks complained that they weren&rsquo;t allowed to live among whites, but now  &mdash;  when they legally can  &mdash;  most still maintain domiciles in black areas.  Most still socialize with other blacks and attend black churches.  They comprise an authentic ethnic group with its own culture, and they don&rsquo;t want to mimic whitey, who most view as too strait-laced and serious.  <br>
Supplying equal opportunity is the most we can  &mdash;  and should  &mdash;  do.</p>

		<p>One of the good things about being a race realist is that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about any of this. </p>
<p>While nice white liberals are wringing their hands and voluntarily attending seminars by black activists, we are silently noting the obvious: barring genetic engineering, blacks will never close the gap between themselves and whites/Asians.</p>
<p>I have been to these forums and symposiums when they were mandatory in college and in the military (and twice in the corporate world). The nice white liberals join the black racists in nodding their egg-shaped heads sagely as the black speaker blames whitey for all the proud black man&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>Nobody ever challenges this publicly, but afterward a few people will whisper the obvious. But the nice white liberals seem visibly troubled at the thought that they are to blame for black failure. So they go from theory to theory in an effort to close the gap. But quotas, welfare transfers, enterprise zones, mentors, role models, federal programs, self esteem workshops, Afrocentric &#8220;education&#8221;, ebonics and everything else has been tried and the gap remains (or even widens).</p>

<p>This is an astute observation/speculation. I have a friend who&rsquo;s a Ph.D, and he says that he gets many grad students who just aren&rsquo;t cut out for graduate studies. Why? He says he thinks it&rsquo;s because kids (of all races) are constantly being told &#8220;You can do ANYTHING! The sky&rsquo;s the limit!&#8221; So many take unrealistic paths that just aren&rsquo;t suited for them. </p>
<p>My wife is also a professor, and she confirms (without intending to) that affirmative action grad students are the weakest. Not all minority students (Asians tend to be strong), just those minority/black students advanced through affirmative action.  <br>

		<p>How can this be? Why are Bantu stereotypes blamed for the failures of Bantu men? I thought that the election of Barack Hussein Obama was supposed to correct all that, by shattering stereotypes, and moving this country into a post-racial mode.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it touted that Obama was the &#8220;messiah&#8221;, and peace would reign upon the Earth and the African lion would lie down with the white lamb? Wasn&rsquo;t it also said that Bantu children needed more Bantu teachers, because they&rsquo;d feel better if they were taught by someone who &#8220;looked like them&#8221;?</p>
<p>The ancient Chinese proverb is correct: The more things change, the more they remain the same.</p>
<p>When it comes to Bantus the proverb certainly rings true.</p>

		<p>If being &#8220;Europeanized&#8221; is at fault here, why hasn&rsquo;t this process harmed the third- and fourth-generation Asian-Americans, who seem to have assimilated quite successfully?</p>
<p>I think the term &#8220;Europeanized&#8221; here is really code for societal expectations that most blacks regard as unfair simply because they are biologically incapable of meeting them.  It is simply easier for them to behave like pimps and clowns and the modern welfare state has insulated them from the worst consequences of this, removing the main disincentive.</p>

		<p>Yes, BET certainly promotes demeaning stereotypes.  But nobody is forced to watch it.  I don&rsquo;t watch ABC, MSNBC, CBS, or FOX because their shows are demeaning to whites.  Frankly, I think that any parent who has a television in the house hasn&rsquo;t thought things through.  Under the best of circumstances it is difficult to raise your children right.  Do you really need a moral sewer gushing forth in your family room?<br>
