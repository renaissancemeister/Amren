			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joel Kotkin, newgeography, January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With China&rsquo;s new prominence in global affairs, the Han race, which constitutes 90 percent of the Chinese population, is suddenly the most dominant cohesive ethnic group in the world  &mdash;  and it is seeking to remain that way through strategic alliances, aggressive trade policy, and attacks on racial minorities within the country&rsquo;s boundaries. The less tribally cohesive, more fragmented West is, meanwhile, losing out.</p>
<p>Almost 20 years ago, I wrote a book called Tribes that sought to trace the role of ethnicity, race, and religion in economic and geopolitical affairs. At the time, there was some skepticism about the continuing influence of ethnicity; some considered the work, frankly, regressive and racist. Now, however, my thesis from 1992 has really come to fruition. We are living in the age of tribes  &mdash;  and China is just the start.</p>
<p>Such primitive racial instincts were supposed to be long ago pass√©: We&rsquo;re supposed to be living in Thomas Friedman&rsquo;s &#8220;flat&#8221; world or Kenichi Ohmae&rsquo;s &#8220;borderless world.&#8221; By now, supposedly, everyone is increasingly interconnected and undifferentiated. Affairs should be managed neatly by deracinated professionals, working on their iPads from Brussels, Washington, or any of the other &#8220;global&#8221; capitals.</p>
<p>But most people do not really see themselves as members of a large multinational unit, global citizens, or &#8220;mass consumers.&#8221; Instead the drivers of history remain the essentials: the desire to feed one&rsquo;s family, support the health of the tribe, and shape the immediate community. The particularistic continues to trump the universalistic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The rise of Chinese national identity, increasingly stripped of its socialist clothing, must be seen as the driving force behind the new tribalism. The country&rsquo;s re-emergence as a great world power expresses the cultural ascendency not so much of Marxism or Maoism but of the Han race, which in only a few decades could control the world&rsquo;s largest economy.</p>
<p>{snip} Essentially, the Han has become a tribal superpower that treats other groups  &mdash;  from China&rsquo;s non-Han minority to much of the rest of the world  &mdash;  as a vast semi-colonial periphery. And with its growing economic and military might, Han China may soon be able to impose its will on some of these &#8220;lesser&#8221; cultures, should it desire.</p>
<p>China may be setting the underlying tone of our new world, but many other groups have responded in similarly tribal fashion. Like China, Russia has abandoned internationalist communism for a kind of Leninist state-capitalism with racial overtones, as evident both in the increasingly rough treatments of darker-skinned ethnic minorities such as Chechens and an aggressive ethnic Russian retro-imperialism  &mdash;  once disguised in socialist trappings  &mdash;  toward &#8220;near abroad&#8221; countries like Georgia, Armenia, Ukraine, and Belarus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Europe today can best be seen as divided between three cultural tribes: Nordic-Germanic, Latin, and Slavonic. In the north, there is a vast region of prosperity, a zone of Nordic dynamism. Characterized by economies based on specialized exports, a still powerful Protestant ethic, and a culture that embraces authority, these countries  &mdash;  including Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Germany, and, arguably, the Baltic states  &mdash;  are becoming ever more aware of the cultural, fiscal, and attitudinal gulf between them and the southern countries.</p>
<p>At the same time, the attempt to build a new European identity fused with immigrants appears to be failing. As Chancellor Angela Merkel noted, Germany has failed at &#8220;multi-culturalism.&#8221; Such sentiments may be reviled by the media, academics, and even business leaders in Northern Europe, but they are clearly popular at the grassroots. Once considered paragons of liberalism, countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands have incubated potent anti-immigration movements.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The last European tribe includes the Slavic countries, centered by Russia but extending to parts of the Balkans as well, places like Ukraine, Belarus, Serbia, and Moldova that historically have looked east as well as west and are currently defined by shrinking populations and weak democratic institutions. A historic pattern of Russian domination is evident here, based in large part on a revived Slavic identity that embraces similarities in religion, culture, history, and language with countries living under Russia&rsquo;s shield. In this sense the czars are back, not a great development for the rest of the world or for the fading chimera of a &#8220;common European home.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tribalism will also threaten the efficacy of international organizations, which tend to assume common interests between groups. Instead we have to think of future international cooperation in more traditional terms, balancing distinct sets of tribal interest. As tribes continue to pursue their own interests ever more zealously, the idealistic rhetoric of multinational organizations will become ever more risible. The way China and other developing countries snarled up the Copenhagen climate conference reflects this shift.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In essence, we need to shift from seeking labored, politically correct commonalities among cultures and work more on learning to reconcile and co-exist with people who always, inevitably, will remain strangers. This means, for example, throwing out the idea that any international model  &mdash;  say, the Anglo-American version  &mdash;  can be imposed or grafted onto other cultures.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about us?&#8221; Anglo-Americans may ask. In a globalized world that speaks and writes in English, the Anglosphere retains some natural advantages. This is where the most elite colleges and universities are located, and where the top financial firms are concentrated. Equally important, the Anglosphere also controls much of what the developing countries will most need in the future  &mdash;  food  &mdash;  through the unsurpassed fecundity of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Demographics and a unique ability to absorb a wide range of immigrants make the Anglosphere economically and demographically vibrant  &mdash;  a point often missed by political scientists like the late Samuel Huntington and some elements on the political right. By 2050, the Anglosphere will be home to upwards of 550 million people, the largest population grouping outside China and India. English-speakers may not straddle the world like the 19th century empire-makers, but they are likely to remain first among equals well into the current century.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this will depend on how the English-speaking world evolves and learns to embrace its multiracial population without losing its sense of a common identity. Ideally, the Anglosphere can offer an alternative that embraces not merely a language but a set of historically achieved values such as democracy and freedom of speech, religion, and markets. Already many of the English-speaking world&rsquo;s exemplary writers, artists, industrialists, and entrepreneurs hail from a vast and ever expanding array of backgrounds. It is in the melding of many into one dynamic culture that the Anglosphere may retain a powerful influence over our emerging world of tribes.<br/>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>No.  It is our rejection of those values which will allow us to be still be seen as _Aglos_.  Anything else will be seen as both a soft headed self-victimization and sure proof that if Anglos can do it with Asian/Black/Hispanic faces, then everyone else can too, without the diversicrud.</p>

<p>Idiot.  You start out pretending you got it right and then you slip into pure multicult Kool Aid mode.  I swear if you did a full werewolf and started howling at the moon it would be less disgusting.</p>
<p>What makes America strong is the SYMBOL that we provide for a world that envies our strength and our freedom and our dominance of our own, open, places.  We live like kings in a beautiful country with large, openspaces and a standard of living that is NOTHING like the dense-pack lemming colonies of SWA, Africa and China.</p>
<p>Get your head out man, THINK about what your are commenting so blitheringly about.  We don&rsquo;t want to try and drive these people to &#8216;become like us&rsquo; by becoming like -them-.  Losing all the things they envy about our position.  We want to stay _U.S. for US_ (starting with no more immigration) and force them to try and catch up while feeding their overpop as overhead.</p>
<p>THAT is what will make us competive.  Not your sophist, liberal, sputum.</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s famous words come to mind here&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;Qu&rsquo;ils mangent de la brioche.&#8221;  &#8216;Let them eat cake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(In Chinese culture, there is a variation of this story that involves rice and meat, instead of bread and cake.  This was quoted by Emperor Hui of Jin who ruled ancient China in the 3rd Century. When his imperial officials informed him of victims of a famine having no rice to eat, he replied: &#8220;If they do not have rice, why not eat meat stew?&#8221;  i.e.  The Han Would Get The Strategy.)</p>

		<p>The article describes the sense of inter-Slavic pride &amp; unity growing among immigrants and I notice it in the construction industry since 2008. Even the Catholic Slavs are proud to be Slavs and no longer ignore the Orthodox. There&rsquo;s more willingness to try not using English and communicate in our respective languages. NOBODY looks at you weird when you mention Slavic Brotherhood or praise Russia as our leader. I dreamed of this for almost 25 years through the 90s and now I&rsquo;m living it.</p>

<p>China is not only going to be racially monolithic, more or less, but will actively maintain that status.</p>

<p>During those various dynasties when China was the foremost nation on earth, foreigners were allowed, but kept segregated and apart from the &#8220;celestials&#8221;. Why NOT? After all, they are mere barbarians.</p>

		<p>Multiracialism for the &#8220;Anglosphere&#8221; is what we&rsquo;ll have to learn to &#8220;embrace&#8221;, according to this Joel Kotkin. Tribalism is more understandable for the developing countries, even though nobody wants to move there anyway. Just another person with a megaphone attempting to destroy us from within.</p>

		<p>I strongly agree with this article. Almost every bit of news, both conflict and cooperation can be seen through the lens of Tribe. Tribe is like the proverbial elephant in the den that no one wants to mention but everyone notices. We are our Tribe, and our Tribe influences us whether one is a White Natonalist or a far left liberal.  I see the goal of the next hundred years as finding a way for our various Tribes to coexist in some kind of mutual agreeable federation. We can&rsquo;t continue to ignore our divisions. But we also must find a way of allowing each Tribe to control it&rsquo;s own destiny. And that may or perhaps must lead to some separation for the various Tribes.</p>

		<p>If  the  Chinese  are  so  racially  monolithic  then  why  is  the  government  so  dictatorial  in  terms  of  ideas.  It  seems  that  if the  Chinese  &#8220;Firewall&#8221;  in  terms  of  ideas  is breached  then  you  will  have  so  much  diverse  thinking  that  its  market-communism  system  would  disintegrate.</p>
<p>Point is:  if  they  are  so  alike then  there  would  be  no  need  to  put  a  straitjacket  on their  thinking.</p>
<p>China  is  becoming  economically  influential  because  of  its  huge  cheap-labor  population  coupled  with  its par-with-the-West  technological  competences.  Profits  and  huge  trade  surpluses  are  bound  to  accumulate.</p>

		<p> Very true as to China especially, and it shouldn&rsquo;t take Einstein to figure out that one big reason the Chinese are surging to the fore is that they are very homogeneous   &mdash;   especially for such a huge country. They&rsquo;re also not afflicted with &#8220;White guilt&#8221; as all too many of us are.

<p>I agree that sorting out the separation of tribes, genetic and/or ideological, into many, many more separate countries is the challenge of the next century (hopefully), but I do not think that regional federations, or an international federation is necessary. A world with so many state actors with so many different viewpoints would make such an arrangement even more difficult than it is now. These states will not just disagree about how to get the good thing, they will disagree about what is the good thing i.e. the age of Enlightenment Universalism will be over. And I do not think that that is a bad thing as long as we come together and agree to ad hoc treaties when the need arises, such as to fight climate change. Perhaps a tribal world would be more pragmatic about those types of issues anyway.</p>

		<p>China is becoming a superpower because American businesses sent technology  and jobs to them and the Hans were smart enough to see an opportunity when they saw it. It&rsquo;s that simple really. Yeah, there&rsquo;s more but that&rsquo;s the basic jist of it. A transfer of wealth; economic welfare. </p>

<p>What is scary about that statement is that it tells us there were many brilliant intellects who backed such a hare-brained scheme in the first place.</p>

		<p>To Poster 4 Jedderman:</p>
<p>&#8220;During those various dynasties when China was the foremost nation on earth, foreigners were allowed, but kept segregated and apart from the &ldquo;celestials&rdquo;. Why NOT? After all, they are mere barbarians.&#8221;</p>
<p>This segregation is what (in my opinion) led to China&rsquo;s decline from its position of preeminence. Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty is known as the greatest Emperor in Chinese history because of his willingness to tolerate minorities. He funded China&rsquo;s first mosque, permitted Christian missionaries to operate freely and even gave his daughter in marriage to a Tibetan Chieftain. A subsequent reversal of the tolerance of minorities under his successors led to China&rsquo;s unhealthy insularity.</p>
<p>In 836, Emperor Wenzong passed the &#8220;Imperial Decree against the mixing of races&#8221;, the first anti-miscegnation law in the history of the world (and banned Buddhism because of its &#8220;Indian origins&#8221; for good measure), one of the greatest mistakes a Chinese Emperor ever made.</p>
<p>Because of the prohibition of intermarrying with other races, Chinese colonists quickly lost the trust of the locals in their Western &#8220;non-Han&#8221; provinces. The decree was a factor in their loss of control over Afghanistan two decades later, and put an end to their ambitions for westward expansion.</p>
<p>An Lushan, a Chinese general of Turkish ethnicity alive during the early 9th century, was looked down upon by his Han colleagues. He eventually started a rebellion, bringing the Tang dynasty to the brink of extinction, by relying of the resentment the minorities felt towards the Han race. If his colleagues had been more tolerant of him, he could have contributed to China&rsquo;s growing power, but instead, as a result of the disdain shown by the Han at the time, a disastrous civil war resulted, after which the Tang Dynasty never fully recovered.</p>
<p>The intolerant actions of the Han have only led to decline. We see it time and time again. The recalling of Yongle&rsquo;s exploration fleets during the early 14th century, the amazing ability to commit thousands of works of great historical and literary value to fire for the sake of &#8220;social stability&#8221; (Qin Shi Huangdi and the Cultural Revolution are only the tip of the iceberg) and above all their disdain for foreigners and minorities.</p>
<p>On a brief note, to the best of my knowledge the Han never refer to themselves as &#8220;Celestials&#8221;. They go by &#8220;Hanzi&#8221; (sons of the Han), Tongren (People of the Tang), reflecting their association with the past peaks of Chinese civilisation, and also by &#8220;Huaren&#8221; (People of Hua), a reference to the Chinese founding myth. China is sometimes known by the Chinese as the &#8220;Celestial Empire&#8221;, the term being popularised by the 7th century Chinese poet Li Bai. They use it in much the same way Americans call their home &#8220;The Land of the Free&#8221;, but the Chinese do so with less frequency.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a thin gruel to feed a sense of nationhood. In reality, there are no &#8220;propositional nations&#8221;. Nations are defined by ties of kinship. Everything else is empire. This is why multiracial/multiethnic democracy functions badly or fails entirely. The only to have a stable government while forcing multiple races into the same polity is through despotism.</p>

		<p>The Han are not completely racially homogeneous.  The northerners are tall and pale while the southerners are short and dark, similar to Europe.  Europeans, especially north of the Alps, are probably as racially homogeneous.  There&rsquo;s really no genetic difference between a Briton and German, for instance.</p>

<p>The Chinese are VERY conservative.   I admire the Chinese attitude of tolerating no nonsense among their youth, and their strict discipline in insisting students conform to accepted standards of behavior, but China&rsquo;s technological advances mostly came from either Russia or the West.  After acquisition, they  reversed the engineering in order to learn.  That&rsquo;s no secret and it&rsquo;s accepted knowledge.  </p>
<p>Africa, on the other hand, couldn&rsquo;t build the same things if they were guided step by step through the process, because they don&rsquo;t have people with the ability to understand complicated engineering principles and higher mathematics.  </p>
<p>China is eating Africa alive right now by exploiting the wealth on the continent.  The Tiger has many mouths to feed and MUST expand its options for resources.</p>

		<p>Give me a break. The Chinese are &#8220;successful&#8221; because they&rsquo;ve copied everything that&rsquo;s Western. Like the Japanese, they are good at innovation, but fail miserably at creation. On the other hand, creation is the driver of civilization. You can innovate for only so long because certain situations call for totally new ideas. For example, when certain natural resources go extinct (which will definitely happen), a new sort of alternative-energy based technology will be necessary. In all likelihood, a White person will come up with this technology. If he doesn&rsquo;t, well then the massive Chinese economy that everyone&rsquo;s gushing over will come crashing down. Imagine, if you will, the number of trucks that business rely on, and their need for oil. This is just one example; I can think of so many more. </p>

Does this writer seriously expect Muslims from the Third World to embrace democracy? Heck, they&rsquo;re trying to impose sharia law on the West.

		<p>The Han face a problem of multiculturalism. The Han are actually an ethnic mish-mash of ethnic groups who in ancient times occupied pars of the large landmass currently known as China (and some surrounding areas as well). There are light skinned and dark skinned Han. In the past, official policies and people&rsquo;s inherent views favored Han at the expense of minority groups within their midst, so more and more people labeled themselves Han or married into the Han ethnic group to where the Han were 95%+ (some estimates 99%) of the Chinese population. As modern Communist China has changed to giving more and more special privileges to minority ethnic groups in China, more and more people began to claim they were members of the minority groups and Han have dropped to 90% of the population (and dropping). Sound familar?</p>

<p>Yes, that is true.  However, these &#8220;thousands&#8221; represent the extreme right (high IQ) end of the bell curve for Africans.  The problem is that for every African genius, there are 100 African&rsquo;s of sub-par IQ.  The few geniuses among them are not enough to overcome the ignorance or stupidity in their population, and drive a stable, advanced civilization.  </p>
<p>Compare that to Europeans or N.E. Asians, where the percentage of geniuses in the population is probably 10 times that of Africans.  Even though there are large numbers of low-IQ individuals within both Europeans and Asians, the ratio of low- to high-IQ is not large enough to stifle technological progress and civilization. </p>
<p>Basically, those few African scientists and engineers are anecdotes    &mdash;   exceptions that prove the rule.    </p>

		<p>18:  Assuming this discussion is limited to sub-Saharan (i.e. black) Africa, of course there are thousands of Africans brilliant enough to earn degrees in the hard sciences.  But here are 800 million black people in SSA.  That&rsquo;s the nature of any means-distributed (&#8220;bell curve&#8221;) measure   &mdash;   You&rsquo;ll have those on the extreme ends of the distribution, but most people will be bunched around the middle.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume the average IQ in black Africa is 70, with a standard deviation of 15.  That means an IQ of 145 or more is 5 or more standard deviations above the mean.  In a perfect bell curve distribution, 99.9999699813% is below 5 SDs, 100 minus that is above it.  Multiply that miniscule percentage by 800 million, and you&rsquo;ll come up with about 240.  That means 240 black Africans in Africa have IQs above 145.  Lower the IQ threshold to 130, that being 4 SDs above the mean, and some 25,000 black Africans in Africa have IQs above 130.</p>
<p>Again, all this assumes 70 mean 15 SD and a perfect bell curve.  Real life isn&rsquo;t that neat, so it might be more or less than that.</p>
<p>In the United States, assume 40 million blacks, 85 mean 15 SD, this means 145 IQ is 4 SDs above the mean, 130 IQ is 3 SDs above the mean.  1,200 black Americans have an IQ higher than 145, 54,000 higher than 130.</p>
<p>Now, assume 200 million whites in the U.S., 100 mean, 15 SD.  270,000 have an IQ above 145, 4.5 million above 130.  </p>
<p>This means that there are more white people with IQs above 145 just in one white country than there are blacks with IQs above a whole standard deviation lower (130) in the world.</p>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;ll find a lot of black geniuses.  The statistics prove that.  But you will find far many more white geniuses.</p>
<p>Another thing one must consider is that out of the spirit of affirmative action and racial pity, a black with 130 IQ is just as or perhaps more likely to have the road to an advanced degree in science paved for him or her than a white person with a 145 IQ.</p>

Alex,</p>
<p>&#8220;You are just very wrong re Africa. There are thousands of Africans with advanced degrees in engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, etc. Many have passed through institutions like MIT and Caltech. A good example is computer scientist, Kunle Olukotun. Just Google his name.&#8221;</p>
<p>An African &#8220;advanced degree&#8221; is the equivalent to about a year of college here.  No institution of higher education in Africa is anywhere near the level of the West.  None.   Nor are they anywhere near the standards of China, Japan, or Korea.  A black with a degree in Africa could not pass competency tests in the universities in those countries, with a few tiny exceptions.</p>
<p>I remember seeing three or four blacks in my math and chemistry classes for the first couple of weeks, then there were none.  That is the situation today also.  Even the affirmative action grading doesn&rsquo;t help them get through the more difficult subjects, like it does in studying easier subjects like law and journalism.</p>
<p>There are going to be exceptions to everything, so your computer technician is probably one of them, but one or a few exceptions does not disprove the rule.</p>
<p>Africa, like Haiti, is a failure in spite of massive aid from the West.  If its people were of a higher intellect, Africa, with all its valuable and plentiful resources, would be the gem of the world.  </p>
<p>If the Chinese are successful in taking over the countries in Africa they have targeted, we could possibly eventually see a first world society emerge, unless the black population is too much for the Chinese to carry, as they are here in this country.</p>
<p>Sorry, but success speaks for itself, and so does failure.</p>

&#8220;The claim that the Han Chinese are are one big closely related group is also bogus.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the latest available genetic evidence shows that claim is untrue.</p>
<p>&#8220;With such a large group of same-language speakers you are bound to get much genetic diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Much genetic diversity&rsquo;, yes, but on what level?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(09)00470-4" rel="nofollow">http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(09)00470-4</a></p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our results showed that the Han Chinese population is intricately substructured, with the main observed clusters corresponding roughly to northern Han, central Han, and southern Han. However, simulated case-control studies showed that genetic differentiation among these clusters, ALTHOUGH VERY SMALL [emphasis added by me - Anonymous] (FST = 0.0002 0.0009), is sufficient to lead to an inflated rate of false-positive results even when the sample size is moderate.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;Genetic tests of large samples have shown distinct North-South genetic distinctions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again from the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The results of the STRUCTURE analysis are also very interesting as they show the expected clinality of variation within China rather than sharp distinctions&#8221;</p>
<p>The variations within the Han Chinese are not nearly as great as you&rsquo;re attempting to make them out to be.  In fact, (according to real geneticists, anyway) they are to be expected in a population that size.</p>
<p>&#8220;Genetic distinctions have also been noted between the speakers of the different Han dialects.&#8221;</p>
<p>Utterly meaningless statement.  &#8216;Genetic distinctions have been noted&rsquo; amongst the natives of Germany.  So what?</p>

		<p>What I can gather from reading this article is that any nation that will be of any importance in the world will be nationalistic, monocultural and racially homogenous.  Russia, Europe and China will be main players on the world stage but I seriously doubt China will become the largest economy.  This hype about China is the same sort of the thing we used to hear about Japan back in the early 1990s and look how that turned out.  While stressing the role of homogenity in rising nations, it says the English speaking world&rsquo;s success will come from integrating third world immigration into its countries because it results in a more fecund population.  These countries decline in importance and have to rely on agricultural exports for economic growth.  Did I get it right?  </p>
<p>Australia, New Zealand, Canada still have overwhelmingly White populations. They do not have to choose such a future for themselves and they should probably break with the US if continues on its road to oblivion and traditionally align with Great Britain once again.  What about the US with it&rsquo;s 60 percent White population?  I can&rsquo;t say but I&rsquo;m not optimistic about the future.    </p>

&#8220;For example, when certain natural resources go extinct (which will definitely happen), a new sort of alternative-energy based technology will be necessary. In all likelihood, a White person will come up with this technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Except Japan soundly dominates PV and Fuel Cell tech as is shown by their highly cited and voluminous patents.</p>
<p>The original article is nothing more than anti-Russian, anti-Chinese propaganda singing the praises of Anglo-American multiculturalism. There are so many factual errors that it&rsquo;s really not worth responding to.</p>

Yes indeed   &mdash;   there ARE thousands of Africans who have such degrees. But there are a BILLION other blacks on that continent who DON&rsquo;T have such degrees, and who never, ever will. There are a BILLION Africans whose IQ averages 70. That means a BILLION blacks who couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the coursework of even the MIDDLE-SCHOOL lessons of those subjects, let along practice them at the undergrad level&hellip; or the graduate level&hellip; or the professional, experimental level. </p>
<p>A few THOUSAND smart, scientifically inclined Africans, out of the 2nd most populous continent on earth? Yes indeed, such talented individual Africans do exist. Too bad about the other 99%. </p>
<p>That other 99%, their new Chinese masters will chew them up and spit them out. </p>

&#8220;Give me a break. The Chinese are &ldquo;successful&rdquo; because they&rsquo;ve copied everything that&rsquo;s Western.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can only disagree. I&rsquo;m quite confident that within ten years you&rsquo;ll see something to change your mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the other hand, creation is the driver of civilization. You can innovate for only so long because certain situations call for totally new ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Poster 20 Anonymous:<br/>
If that is the case, then how is it that the Chinese and Japanese have built a civilisation by themselves, and kept it going for several thousand years? Their early achievements, although not on par with later Western advancements also call for &#8220;creation&#8221; rather than innovation. It takes more than mere regurgitating and rote-memorising (these being the traits attributed to East Asia) to observe that the moon caused the tides, or to play a critical role in the early development of gunpowder weapons or even to keep a huge centralised empire intact for several centuries at a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Han are actually an ethnic mish-mash of ethnic groups who in ancient times occupied pars of the large landmass currently known as China (and some surrounding areas as well).&#8221;</p>
<p>But despite genetic differences, the many people who make up the Han are tied together by much stronger cultural ties. Hence my belief that culture is more important than genetics in determining a society&rsquo;s prospects.</p>
<p>As modern Communist China has changed to giving more and more special privileges to minority ethnic groups in China, more and more people began to claim they were members of the minority groups and Han have dropped to 90% of the population (and dropping). Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Much of the change has been due to the one child policy. Minorities are allowed an unlimited number of children, while most Han are only permitted one. But I agree that there are a considerable number of Chinese passing themselves off as a minority even though they might be one eighth Manchu. The affirmative action positions available within the Communist party and the Government for minorities are too great to pass over for people in a hyper-competitive country.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is in itself not a problem. In fact I think it can do China a deal of good.</p>

		<p>  China is a remarkably homogenous population, where people are very similar genetically. There is certainly less genetic variation than most European populations.  There has been some minor mixture with other East Asian populations: Manchu, Mongol, Thai, Korean, etc., In addition, you do find some slight variations of height and skin coloring in different parts of China.<br/>
 <br/>
  Minorities, while present, are a tiny portion of China&rsquo;s huge population. With this in mind, I expect an increasing vilification of Chinese success because of their lack of diversity. China is a living refutation of the liberal shibboleth  &mdash;  &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221;<br/>

		<p>#21 IIRC studies have shown that the standard deviation for asians is 12 points and black 13 points. IMHO IQ as a measure of mental performance isnt very precise, there are neurological disturbances that gives an higher IQ score but makes the carrier dysfunctional or semidysfunctional. Two persons with the same IQ score can be totally different in real world ability. <br/>
 <br/>
A proper standford-binet IQtest consists of many smaller tests that are weighted together to produce a final score. If you want to you can change the weighting to give people with an aptitude for science or technology higher scores at the expense of people who doesnt or vice versa (because scientist/engineers will score better on some of the subtests but worse on others). In my opinion the current weighting system seriously favors liberal arts people. </p>

<p>History has shown that you don&rsquo;t need to be good at creating new things to build an impressive empire. Look at the ancient Mongols what the hell did they create?

Yet despite being a *one trick pony* the Mongols built an empire that would last for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Getting back to the present, the Chinese do not need to create anything new. All they need to do is manage what they got more efficiently, let western civilization commit suicide, and they&rsquo;ll still be plenty of technology available to create an empire that will last for the next couple hundred years.</p>
