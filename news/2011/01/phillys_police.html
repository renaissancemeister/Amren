<h1><a href="http://www.presstv.ir/usdetail/161722.html">Philly&rsquo;s Police Accused of Conducting Racially Motivated &#8216;Stop &amp; Frisk&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>PressTV, January 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A U.S. federal judge is expected to scrutinize a controversial police policy allowing officers to randomly stop and frisk anyone they deem potentially threatening.</p>
<p>The police department in Philadelphia is accused of practicing this controversial policy.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a suit on behalf of eight plaintiffs who accuse the Philadelphia police force of racially motivated stops of black and Latino men in the city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FACTS &amp; FIGURES</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, data obtained from the police department shows that from the 253,333 stops in 2009, more than 72 percent were African Americans. Yet just over 8 percent of those stops led to an arrest. (ACLU of Pennsylvania)</p>
<p>A new study suggests the chances of a minority suspect being arrested are 30 percent higher on average than a white suspect, even when controlling for such things as the suspect&rsquo;s demeanor, the severity of the offense, the presence of witnesses, and the quantity and quality of evidence at the scene. (Slated for publication in the May 2011 issue of the journal Criminology)</p>

		<p>Why are whites racially profilled to be law upholders?<br>
It seems so many people interested int the law and the<br>
survival of the country are white. This is really<br>
skewed and unfair. Why cant more white<br>
have dozens of children they barely know or care for..why<br>
cant whites drop out of the 9th grade..why do whites insist<br>
on working hard and paying almost all of the countries taxes?<br>
I say equal criminality for all!</p>

<p>Pardon me, but the cop can&rsquo;t tell the &#8220;severity of the offense&#8221; or the &#8220;quantity and quality of evidence&#8221; until after he stops and frisks the person and finds some sort of contraband.</p>
<p>The same people whining about the Philly PD doing this are probably the same people who wanted them to do this a year ago, in order to &#8220;get them guns off the street.&#8221;  I wonder how they think the cops are supposed to &#8220;get guns off the street&#8221; without first getting them away from the person to begin with.</p>

		<p>I remember talking to a black co worker about cameras being placed in high crime areas.He said &#8220;yeah they are putting them in all the black neighborhoods and that&rsquo;s not right&#8221;.I told him that it&rsquo;s true but they&rsquo;re where all the high crime areas are in the city.He responded by saying &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re going to put them in black neighborhoods to be fair you have to put them where white people live&#8221;.I guess equality must apply in everything today even police stop and frisk or surveillance whether its needed or not.</p>

		<p>Similar &#8220;stop and search&rsquo;s&#8221; were practised in high crime neighbourhoods of London.  Naturally there were the usual cries of racial discrimination since a higher proportion of Blacks seem to have been stopped and searched, most likely due to more suspecious behaviour drawing the attention of the police.  My recollection is that a higher proportion of the stop and seaches of Blacks did convert to arrests of Blacks than for Whites since the Blacks were more likely to be carrying conceiled weapons or drugs.  I beleive these &#8220;stop and search&#8221; powers are now greatly watered down.  The UK Home office was required to keep race versus arrest and conviction data, haven&rsquo;t been able to find the downloadable spreadsheets for several years now. </p>

		<p>Look, you can&rsquo;t win if you&rsquo;re a white cop.  Any and every stop of a non-white will be under suspicion for racial motivations.  If I was a cop, I would never frisk or stop a non-white.  Let them go about their business.  As long as they&rsquo;re not hurting a white person or their property, let them go along on their way.  Let the black cops frisk their own.</p>

		<p>Rather than look at &#8216;arrests from stops&rsquo; try looking at &#8216;Crime from area and ethnic population load in area.&rsquo;</p>
<p>See, a cop who can get an 8% drop in crime -of any color- thinks he&rsquo;s doing his job.  And so do I.</p>
<p>But where the cop follows crime to find his business-</p>

<p>It matches up to the 610,000 blacks living in about five neighborhoods centered on Germantown and Point Breeze, Philadelphia.  Where they have an 82% local density out of an overall 44% city population count.</p>
<p>And the 187,400 Hispanics, living adjacent.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not pretty but we _have to_ look at the social evolutionary differences in our peoples _as differential starting points_ to civilized behavior.</p>
<p>And then decide how we are going to survive each others proximity in a cultural landscape ever more dominated by high tech, complex interactive, economic drivers.</p>
<p>In which the average black IQ is 87 and in the inner cities, it&rsquo;s more like African norms of 70.</p>
<p>And the average Hispanic is only about 5 points higher.</p>

		<p>I remember way back when the noble Doberman became the breed that everybody wanted. The puppy mills responded by churning out poorly-bred specimens that gave the whole breed a bad name. In every city you had people being attacked by dogs whose parents shouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to breed. The dog pounds were full of useless, maladjusted Dobies. Do you think they were there because the dogcatchers were breedists, or was it because Dobies were the ones who were biting everybody?</p>
<p>It took some harsh measures to clean up the Wild West and it is going to take some harsh measures now. You would think that honest, hardworking Blacks would be hollering louder than anybody else for a crackdown on those specimens of their race who are giving all of them a bad name. </p>
<p>The Blacks who only want to be looked upon as equals by Whites get their feelings hurt when White women clutch their purses tighter as they pass them on the street, but who do they think trained those White women to behave that way? If they learned it in school, it sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t the teachers who taught it to them.</p>
<p>Contrary to what the liberals preach, most racism is based upon knowledge, not ignorance. Whites know what happens to neighborhoods when Black criminals descend upon them, and we know that if you catch one Black by the toe they all holler. We know  what our eyes and ears tell us. The sooner the law-abiding Black citizens accept that we are not ignorant hillbillies who hate them because of their complexion and align themselves with Whites to help us clean up the trash, the sooner we will be able to view them as equals.</p>

		<p>Philadelphia is a very racially segregated city.  I would assume the majority of crime occurs in the black neighborhoods, therefor explaining why 72% of those searched were blacks.  The police do not need to be stopping people in safer neighborhoods where crimes are not being committed, nor do they need to be stopping suited businessmen Downtown everytime a crime is committed in the area.</p>

		<p>Diversity has increased the probability of victimization to the degree that we are now willing to give up our liberties and subject ourselves to what would otherwise be gov&rsquo;t sponsored sexual assault. </p>
<p>Is there another way to look at it? Gov&rsquo;t agents are allowed to detain us and pat-down our chests, hips, groins and thighs without a warrant on the basis of instinct!</p>
<p>Diversity doesn&rsquo;t just increase crime and drive us to expensive neighborhoods to escape minorities: it fundamentally alters our ideas of good government. And to think the US started in armed rebellion against taxes!</p>

<p> Such a vague statement since it doesn&rsquo;t take into account the crimes committed. Violent crimes in the US are so overwhelmingly committed by so called minorities when compared to whites that there is never any discussion on this, it&rsquo;s a given fact that blacks prey on whites as a matter of social interaction nowadays and anyone who disputes this is either a fool or a liar.</p>
<p> The pc brainwashing isn&rsquo;t working out so well when the violence only increases, and we can only hope that all people find it within themselves to live ethically instead of ethnically.</p>

		<p>I drive through Chester PA on I95 every morning and afternoon Monday through Friday on my way to work. There are video billboards that regularly show the pictures of people wanted for murder, armed robbery, and rape.The pictures are mug shots, obviously the wanted criminals have been arrested in the past. And the wanted criminals are nearly all black and mestizo. </p>

		<p>I thought it was against the law to LIE to the Court!!!  So why are the assertions of the ACLU tolerated?  The truth is, blacks commit the majority of the crimes, period end of report.  They need to be arrested as a result, no excuses.  Screw the ACLU.  I am interested in the TRUTH, not in a bunch of whiny social-justice sniveling marxist attorneys who are lying through their teeth.

		<p>The cops don&rsquo;t just stop people because of skin color and frisk them. The police know when and where most crime happens and that is where they place most of their attention. </p>
<p>Years ago a friend of mine who is white was stopped and searched in a black neighborhood at about 2:00 AM and when he asked the officer why the officer explained that the only reason a white guy would be in that neighborhood at that time of night was to buy drugs. The officer was correct but he didn&rsquo;t get to make an arrest because he caught the guy on the way in and not on the way out so he had not purchased the crack at that time. </p>
<p>Most crime does happen in certain areas at certain times of night and those neighborhoods tend to be black and most of the people there are black. If you want to catch fish you have to know the good fishing spots. </p>
