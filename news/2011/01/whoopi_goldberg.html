<h1>Whoopi Goldberg Among Producers of Provocative Musical <cite>White Noise,</cite> Sounding Off in Chicago</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kenneth Jones, Playbill, January 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An eight-week Chicago run of White Noise, the new rock musical about a pop sister act that performs White Supremacy-laced songs, will be co-produced by Whoopi Goldberg and directed and choreographed by Broadway&rsquo;s Sergio Trujillo.</p>
<p>Performances begin April 1 toward an April 9 opening at the Royal George Theatre. Featuring a cast of 19, the production is produced by Holly Way, Jay Strommen, Tom Leonardis and Whoopi Goldberg. {snip}</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the producers characterize the work: &#8220;White Noise is a provocative new rock musical that follows a pair of sisters who are discovered by a powerful record producer, and groomed into a well-packaged rock/pop band, which mixes irresistible harmonies with coded rhetoric into chart-blazing hits. Inspired by real life, White Noise fuses today&rsquo;s headlines and blogs into a cautionary tale that challenges conventional notions of free speech, media and the power of pop culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Goldberg, who has produced Broadway&rsquo;s Ma Rainey&rsquo;s Black Bottom and Thoroughly Modern Mille, said in a statement, &#8220;White Noise smacks you in a challenging, emotional and entertaining way. The producing team looks forward to bring this unflinchingly honest new production to Chicago where audiences are sophisticated, aware and open to a musical that will certainly remind them of today&rsquo;s headlines and might awaken a new awareness of current social issues.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Whoopi can&rsquo;t find a blue eyed devil that is persecuting her people, so she invents one. </p>
<p>She would better serve mankind by  some production bringing attention to black on black violence, black illegitimacy, black marriage, black education, etc&hellip;. But those subjects would scarcely be the fault of whites. </p>

		<p>Disgusting and Reprehensible. Imagine a play called &#8220;Black Noise&#8221; that uses rap-style songs to lampoon &#8220;black supremacist&#8221; groups (such as the NAACP). Would it receive critical acclaim? Would it even be allowed?</p>
<p>My opinion of Whoopi Goldberg has been going down in recent years, and now I think it has just about hit bottom. Despite her mainstreaming into  every aspect of American society, she is just as much about harboring the racial grievance grudge as any other black person. </p>
<p>How ironic that this deconstruction of the white (read European) mindset is playing at the Royal George Theatre, a theatre with a very European sounding name. I&rsquo;m sure the well-heeled liberal elite are relishing the delicious irony of this, as are the mostly-white theatergoers who can revel in their upstanding high-mindedness at not being like the lowbrow racist white masses they go to laugh at.</p>
<p><i> White Noise fuses today&rsquo;s headlines and blogs into a cautionary tale that challenges conventional notions of free speech</i> </p>
<p>Translation: Free speech should only be allowed for approved groups, and certainly not for those vicious &#8220;racists,&#8221; as we know that only those on the right can ever be stirred to violence. As a group, blacks are in favor of free speech only insofar as it allows them to have their say. The concept of free speech for all is definitely &#8220;a white thing&#8221; they wouldn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

		<p>I liked Goldi Whoopi when she first hit the scene. A talented black person that wasn&rsquo;t constantly shoving race in your face. But after listening to her on The Spew defend that sociopath Vick as &#8220;just doing things that are culturally different&#8221; concerning his fighting, torturing and killing of helpless animals, I realized she was just a typical black that had slipped in under the radar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Typically black&#8221; is the inclination to excuse all forms of sick behavior when the perpetrator is black. And it is not being done by just black people anymore. Our ruling class liberal elite and big media are all in on it. She&rsquo;s no better. Now, since everything is OK to do, I&rsquo;m waiting to see Eminem make videos about killing black women. Fairs fair, isn&rsquo;t it? Tit for tat? Oh, wait a minute. Eminem probably has more class than that. And no one would care anyway. Just another day in the hood.</p>

		<p>Remember, when someone in entertainment claims that they are creating a work &#8220;ripped straight from the headlines,&#8221; they can still stray far from the truth. Mr. Wolf, the creator of &#8220;Law and Order,&#8221; said that all of his episodes are &#8220;ripped from the headlines,&#8221; but his show inverts pesky little details like race. At least 85% of crime in metro NY is committed by blacks and latinos. 90% of the suspects are white on the show. Way to take one from Wolf&rsquo;s playbook, Whoopi. There is a surplus of black on white hate, and a dirth of white on black crime. So naturally, a play about wicked whites seems the healthy thing to do.</p>

<p>This is all about giving self-righteous elites an opportunity to mock their favorite target of opportunity   &mdash;   whites who are just slightly less affluent than themselves. See, they consider themselves so far above blacks that blacks really aren&rsquo;t an issue for them. But they still need to make sure everyone knows they&rsquo;re just a little better than other whites. And what better way to do it than attending this trendy production by Whoopi? Say what you want, but Whoopi sure has that crowd figured out.</p>

		<p>This is, pure and simple, nothing more than anti-white hatred by one of the biggest racists on the scene today.</p>
<p>She also said recently that whites were racists if they felt nervous when a group of black males might be heading toward them on the street.</p>
<p>She fits in well on The View, because the people on the show have an intellectual level which is on a par with about the third grade, and I&rsquo;m sorry if I offended third grade children.</p>
<p>I watched a few minutes of it a few times when O&rsquo;Reilly showed excerpts to make a point.  How anybody could sit through the whole thing and listen to the childish, biased remarks of this Whoopi and Joy Behar is amazing.  It&rsquo;s strictly nonsense.</p>

		<p>I find the notion that a &#8220;powerful record producer&#8221; would put out coded pro white music is laughable. That powerful record producers put out anti white music constantly is a more accurate description of reality. Lets see if it gets made into a low budget Lifetime channel movie. <br>
 The idea is obviously taken from Prussian Blue, their reception by the media wasnt exactly as described in this plays narration.</p>

<p>A cautionary tale?  About whites?   I find that this, like everything of its type, engages in hinty code-language that leaves it to you to guess what&rsquo;s left out between the lines. They&rsquo;re being coy and provocative, but don&rsquo;t want to come right out and say it.  Yaknowwhamsayin?   Yeah, Whoopi, we know.</p>

		<p>Many black rappers have made millions espousing strident black nationalism, with not-so-coded references to the philosophy of the Nation of Islam such as &#8220;blue eyed devils&#8221;.  So the producers are right, <i>White Noise</i> is indeed &#8220;inspired by real life&#8221;, but as usual they have reversed the races to make the &#8220;bad guys&#8221; white.</p>
<p>As for challenging the conventional notion of free speech, well, I wouldn&rsquo;t censor the rappers.  I think it&rsquo;s useful to know what black people are thinking.  It is the left that always seeks to censor its enemies.</p>

		<p>sounds like complete fiction. on the other hand, change to race to blacks and we have the rap music industry. funny how we don&rsquo;t mention the evils of that industry anymore. I remember in the 90&rsquo;s when NWA came out in Los Angeles. The music incited rioting- remember the LA riots ? and violence in general.<br>
back then, the media was all over it. NOwadays, they turn a blind eye to the racism, hatred, violence and crime propogated by blacks.<br>

		<p>White Noise anticipates the arrival of white musical groups in the Anglosphere pursuing political aims in code, much like the German band Rammstein.  Whoopi&rsquo;s concern is irrational, however.  White Americans haven&rsquo;t the sophistication to unravel two, three, or four layers of political meaning.  And they are unlikely to obtain such level of sophistication in less than the one generation left to them as a potent political force.</p>

		<p>Whoopi&rsquo;s name (or rather nickname&hellip;.who the heck knows what her real name is) comes from the fact that, as a child, she had the disgusting habit of farting inappropriately in public.</p>
<p>Just part of how the &#8220;entertainment industry&#8221; laughs behind our backs.  The brainwashing is so severe that no one even asks whats up with a weird name like &#8220;Whoopi&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s bizarre, gross and more than a little disreputable.  And nobody notices.</p>

<p>That is so true.  I was watching a series once last year, and a couple of episodes were arcing over into a black thug/gang storyline.  I became so disinterested I stopped watching.  Enough viewers must have also tuned out, because when I tuned in about a month later, it was back to an all-white affair with only token black presence (though not as the bad guys - ever).</p>
