<h1>SC NAACP: No Insult to Washington Intended</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John O&rsquo;Connor, Herald (Rock Hill, South Carolina), January 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The S.C. NAACP said Tuesday it was not trying to hide a Statehouse statue of George Washington at its annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally Monday.</p>
<p>The group has draped the founding father&rsquo;s statue at previous rallies. It did so again this year, and questions quickly arose about whether Washington was being slighted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A three-sided structure that covered the front and sides of the statue was intended to display a rally graphic and serve as a photo-and-television backdrop for the event&rsquo;s speakers, said S.C. NAACP executive director Dwight James. However, the graphic was not finished before the rally and could not be put in place.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What we had constructed was a background with a graphic to be placed on it,&#8221; James said. &#8220;We weren&rsquo;t trying to obstruct anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>King Day organizers have built similar structures around the statue dating back at least to 2007, according to The State newspaper&rsquo;s archives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Bull.  Do they really expect us to believe that lie?  We don&rsquo;t share their IQ.  They could have stood anywhere.  They could have put up their graphic anywhere.  They did it on purpose, and everybody knows it.  They did it because they intended to send a message, that message being &#8220;forget Washington.  You have a NEW founding father to worship and you live in a far different country now with far different values.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If it was just supposed to be a media backdrop, then it only needed to be covered from the front, not including the sides.</p>
<p>This was deliberate, just as putting on laser shows on the face of Stone Mountain, Georgia many warm weather nights, those shows directly imposed over the visages of Lee, Jackson and Davis, is a deliberate insult.</p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad they explained things so that we can put this misunderstanding behind us. I&rsquo;m sure they will accept that same explanation if White people ever build a box around that made-in-China statue of Mike King that will soon bless our capital.</p>

		<p>I, for one, am so sick and tired of the insults of minorities against the majority.  They wear our people&rsquo;s clothing, eat our food, and attempt to do everything as Europeans.  Unfortunately, they just can not do it.  When, oh when, will the majority wake up?  Deo Vindice</p>

		<p>This is a typical black excuse  &mdash;  one that even a child could see through.  For the last few years, the statue has been draped.  What&rsquo;s their excuse for that?</p>

		<p>To Poster #4: Thank you for the video.  What happens to be striking about the video are the &ldquo;zombie like&rdquo; people portrayed throughout the showing.  I realize the video was a virtual recording but the people represent what our government wants all European Americans/Europeans to become: mindless and easily influenced.     </p>
<p>George Washington was one of the Founders of OUR country, not theirs.  The deification of this MLK person increases each year.  What happens to be sickening is to listen to European Americans/Europeans talk about how great this MLK person was and what he did.           <br>

<p>Nope, because in a few years the name &#8220;Washington&#8221; will not be associated with anyone except blacks such as Denzel Washington.</p>
<p>George Washington is hastily being dropped from school textbooks, only mentioned because he a representative of Dead White Male Slave Holders, nothing more.</p>
<p>That statue will be torn down soon putting an end to any controversy.</p>

		<p>Well, gee, thanks NAACP.  For a second there I thought you were doing everything in your power to erase images of whites and displace us and then call us racists after doing it while uplifting blacks at our expense.  I&rsquo;m glad you cleared everything up for us &#8216;racist white devils.&rsquo; </p>

		<p>Two things I notice about the &#8220;Virtual Tour&#8221; #4 posted as a link;</p>
<p>1. The proposed memorial renders MLK much like a Soviet/Stalinist stye than the straight forward, ordinary man representations of Washington and Jefferson. Even the gigantic Abraham Lincoln at that memorial has him sitting, rather than standing erect with his arms folded like an impatient dictator.</p>

		<p>&#8220;NAACP says it wasn&rsquo;t trying to hide statue of George Washington.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks can&rsquo;t even lie successfully or be deceptive in a clever way. Of course they couldn&rsquo;t stand looking at the statue of George Washington.</p>
<p>The vast majority want nothing to do with white culture, white institutions or white traditions and historic heroes.</p>
<p>I would suggest giving them two states so we could all live separately, but blacks would never agree to it, because it&rsquo;s impossible for them to care for themselves.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even open simple businesses like grocery stores, shoe repairs shops, plumbing contractors, etc, in their own communities, so they couldn&rsquo;t possibly run a country effectively.</p>
<p>Every black country in the world is a failure.</p>

		<p>It is a violation of South Carolina state law to cover up a state monument. SC Code of Laws (section 10-1-165)The father of this country covered in painted plywood? I guess the law doesn&rsquo;t apply to everybody.</p>

		<p>It is easier now than during the 2nd half of the 20th century to perceive hypocrisy in the many movements of Black America. This walled in statue is a clear symbol of their one-sidedness. It is ironic though that the wall is not so nearly oblique as the blind eye they view themselves with, while criticizing the rest of humanity. </p>
