<h1>David Minott Urges Black Community to Flex Its Economic Power</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin L. Clark, Black Enterprise, January 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to a July 2010 poll, 46% of African Americans mostly use their phones to access the Internet, 41% for e-mails, and 33% for Facebook. Despite the breadth of information accessible online, these numbers suggest that members of the Black community are more concerned with entertainment. World music artist David Minott aims to change that by calling millions of African Americans to action in an effort to show them how they&rsquo;ve been underusing the power at their disposal.</p>
<p>With today marking Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the Jamaican born-and-bred musician announced the launch of his &#8220;Our Silence Speaks Volumes: The Black Out&#8221; campaign. Over the course of the next two weeks, Minott will urge people of color to turn off their cell phones for 24 hours starting on the first day of Black History Month, Feb. 1. According to the US Bureau of Census, the black community has an excess of $800 billion in expendable income annually, but still lacks the power of ownership.</p>
<p>&#8220;The silence campaign speaks on what&rsquo;s missing in the black community,&#8221; says Minott, who performs under the name David M. &#8220;Blacks are the largest users of tech, cell phones, text messaging, and have a strong Internet presence as a group.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As the saying goes &#8221; a fool and his money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thats because they would prefer to spend their money on electronics, fancy cars with spinners, bling and fancy shoes.<br>
It&rsquo;s all a facade of wealth and status. They are children with very little self-control or fore-sight.</p>

If blacks, who are reported to be among the poorest of Americans, have $800 billion in expendable income annually, what is the expendable income for whites? Does anyone know? </p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;numbers suggest that members of the Black community are more concerned with entertainment.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If they can get most blacks to participate, which is highly unlikely, when it&rsquo;s over, even if they got the recognition they craved, they would return to their old entertainment habits.</p>
<p>When it comes to blacks, past is prologue.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;d have better luck herding cats than to get blacks off of their cell phones for any amount of time, much less an entire day.  In the mid nineties, before cell phones were as widespread as they are today there was the &#8220;free phone.&#8221;  The &#8220;free phone&#8221; was any phone that blacks could find in their &#8220;workplace&#8221; that they could access for outside calls.  It&rsquo;s hard to believe, but blacks phone calls are even more inane and absurd than their face to face conversations.  </p>

		<p>This is just the kind of article that makes me temporarily insane.  I keep trying to make sense out of nonsense.</p>
<p>What is the point of not using a cell phone for a day?  What?  Even the lone commenter on the original article can&rsquo;t figure that one out.  But if they all went along with that, then perhaps Feb 1 may be the only day in America without a flash mob somewhere.</p>
<p>And where does the number of &#8220;800 billion in expendable income&#8221; for the blacks come from?  What happened to &#8216;they all suffer from poverty and lack of opportunity&rsquo; and constantly require more money for social programs, schools, etc?  And isn&rsquo;t that the excuse du jour for the high crime rate?<br>
All this expendable income, yet they still lack the &#8220;power of ownership&#8221;.  So go buy something.</p>
<p>In the original article, David Minott states that he was involved in the beginning with MLK&rsquo;s struggle for civil rights  &mdash;  excuse me?  That&rsquo;s quite a feat for someone born and raised in JAMAICA (the West Indies) in 1963. <br>
I think that this is someone trying to get a music career in the spotlight.</p>

<p>I wonder how much of that &#8220;expendable income&#8221; is welfare paid for by White people. I also wonder what the expendable income is for Africans under black rule.<br>
I wish they&rsquo;d go all out and have a &#8220;black out&#8221; in our neighborhoods, schools, jobs, malls etc., and then make us REALLY suffer by extending it from 24 hrs. to several decades. <br>

<p>Silence is definitely one thing that&rsquo;s missing in the black community. Silence has been missing in white communities too ever since blacks have been able to wander freely through them.</p>

		<p><i> Despite the breadth of information accessible online, these numbers suggest that members of the Black community are more concerned with entertainment.  </i> </p>
<p>Why does this come as no surprise to me? Aside from the necessities of survival, blacks are primarily interested in three things:</p>
<p>1. Socializing (including sex, of course)<br>
2. Entertainment (including music)<br>
3. Sports</p>
<p>Whites are interested in science and literature and computers and technology and history and art and culture and nature and music and astronomy and theatre and sculpture and crafts and industry and medicine and psychology and poetry and architecture and geography and oceanography and on and on and on. Blacks are mainly interested in the three things named above. </p>
<p>This is one reason why few if any of the world&rsquo;s great achievements have been made by blacks. They lack a passion for most things in life and few great accomplishments can be achieved in life without passion.</p>
<p>The local paper once did a weekly &#8220;Teen Spotlight&#8221; where they asked a featured teen what his or her interests or hobbies were, and those named by black teens almost always fell into one of the three categories named above.</p>

		<p>If this really worked it would be distressing for the drug dealers. I wonder how much of this &#8216;expendable income&rsquo; is drug related, buying or selling? If blacks lack the power of ownership in the communications industry, perhaps they could put some of this 800 billion towards buying shares. I bet there will not be any noticeable effect on phone traffic on 1st February anymore than there will be on 29th February. This is just a load of rocking horse droppings and so is black history month.</p>

		<p>There is no doubt in my mind than that this boycott will take place and will be successful. Just think back to the Montgomery bus affair: they all agreed to stay off the buses, and it would have crippled the bus company and severely hurt the White businesses. This great victory led to more and more integration which spread like a blight, and saw as its ultimate triumph the ascension of a White-hating mulatto to presidential power. No, boys and girls, this Minott, as dopey as he is,<br>
is the new Rosa Parks.<br>
    I am inspired by this boycott; I long for the day when  Whites mobilize to threaten and cause economic ruin to our enemies.  <br>

		<p>Folks, I just have to laugh out loud at black stupidity.  HOW is &#8220;turning off your cell phone for 24 hours&#8221; going to make any statement or impact.  Cell phone service is just that - a service.  The cell phone company doesn&rsquo;t care if you NEVER use your cell phone, what with &#8220;unlimited&#8221; plans these days and &#8220;rollover minutes&#8221;.  As long as you pay your bill, they are happy.  It&rsquo;s like turning off your TV for 24 hours.  So what?  Would that hurt your cable host?  Would they care?  Blacks truly are like children and think things through like children.  Meaning, it&rsquo;s all emotion and little critical thinking or forward thinking.  Here&rsquo;s the deal if every black stays off his cell phone and stays off his computer&hellip;&hellip;THE REST OF US WILL NOTICE FASTER CONNECTIVITY and better service.  Yeah, that would surely threaten us.<br>

		<p>Wonderful idea! They should all boycott whitey and all of his inventions. Stop reading books written by whites. No more white doctors or white medicine. No more renting houses owned by whites or using any white inventions, like radial tires or the printing press. Stop shopping (and shoplifting) in white-owned stores and shops. No more begging fat blondes and redheads for dates. Turn inward. Stop wearing white man&rsquo;s clothes. Go back to the loincloth.</p>

		<p>If race isn&rsquo;t an issue why do many Blacks need to have a &#8220;black community.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why do you need to protect black people? Why not people?</p>
