<h1>Mexico Border City Has Record Drug Killings in &rsquo;10</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Houston Chronicle, January 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The embattled border city of Ciudad Juarez had its bloodiest year ever with 3,111 people killed in drug violence, an official said Saturday.</p>
<p>The city across from El Paso, Texas, has seen its homicide rate soar to one of the highest in the world since vicious turf battles broke out between gangs representing the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels in 2008.</p>
<p>That year, 1,587 people were killed in drug violence, and the toll increased to 2,643 in 2009.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 30,000 people have been killed in drug violence nationwide since President Felipe Calderon launched an offensive against the cartels after taking office in December 2006.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure people understand the level of violence we are talking about here.  The US is used to war withing strict boundaries of human decency.  These do not apply south of the border.  And as part of the conspiracy to keep us in the dark and under control, our media does not report what is happening even when the truth is beyond sensationalistic and would literally have people glued to their TV sets.</p>
<p>It would be a good idea for people to prepare.  As I&rsquo;ve said many times, the US is close to war with mexico.  Here is what the enemy does.  What they will do to you if you let them.</p>

<p>Warning&hellip;.shocking photos.  Women, children and effeminate men probably should not look.  Men, however, most certainly should look.  And understand what we are dealing with.  Keep these photos in mind and keep in mind the fact that this happens all the time, south of the border (and is probably happening here in the US but being covered up) when you make decisions on preparedness.  You must understand the level of priority involved.  It&rsquo;s one thing to think about this in a vague, nebulous manner.  Stare at those pictures and understand that THIS is reality.  This is what these people do.  It&rsquo;s what they are.  Soon, you will probably be among those dealing with this on some level.</p>

		<p>The total casualty list since 2006 amounts now to about 30,000 people killed, with no figures available on those who have been wounded.  The vast majority have been the troops and police of the federal government and the drug members.  There are few who could be considered collateral damage.  Most all have been murdered or killed in ambushes or fire fights, using small arms, which indicates fighting is much more ferocious in Mexico than Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Compare this with troop casualties in Afghanistan below.  Add to that total about 20,000 civilian deaths, and Mexico&rsquo;s drug war is still deadlier than a full combat theater, using tanks, planes, artillery, land mines and IED&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Janet Napolitano announced recently the US is stepping up security on the Afghanistan border, yet, like Bush&rsquo;s czar before her, she ignores the deadly violence only the width of a river away in Mexico, and refuses to advise the Obamanation to send the National Guard to protect the US and US citizens.  It&rsquo;s really amazing.</p>

		<p>One down-side to militarizing the border is that the amounts of money involved in the drug trade will in the end corrupt the US military.</p>
<p>Suppose you are a company commander and are offered the choice of enough money to pay off your mortgage and send your kids to Ivy League universities, or being beheaded?  What would you do?</p>
<p>The end result would simply be the production of a US equivalent of the Zetas.</p>

		<p>I fear for the days when our border cities look like those in Mexico, and have near the same level of violence. Or worse, the level of political corruption that occurs in places like Jamaica due to the profits involved in illegal drugs. </p>
<p>This story stands out, but the massacre of something like 90 illegals by rival drug/human smugglers inside of Mexico also stand out. There is some pretty barbarous stuff going on down there, and its not even a blip on the news here. 18-21 people die in a truck here, and it makes the news, but 17.5 miles south 4 times as many get massacred with bullets, and machetes and its not worthy of mention by most of the news networks. </p>
<p>In the end, the only way to win the war on drugs is to accept that drug taking is a part of the human experience for vast numbers of people, and to have some type of regulated market that steers the curious to the drug equivalencies of beer over whiskey, and Everclear. A first step would be legalizing, and mildly regulating marijuana. That simple act would remove the vast majority of drug users from being exposed to black market dealers who sell everything. It would also take a big bite out of the money involved. We are still paying for prohibition of alcohol in terms of hard liquor consumption, though hard liquor consumption does decline every year. Its not unforeseeable that a similar reversing trend would happen with so called hard drugs; that they would be used in their safer, less potent forms, and with less dangerous means if a reasonable system of regulation were in place long enough to allow it to happen.  </p>
