	<p>Contact: Dr. Wayne Lutton, Editor, The Social Contract Quarterly, 231-347-1171, EditorTSC@thesocialcontract.com</p>
<p>PETOSKEY, Mich., Jan. 12 /Christian Newswire/  &mdash;  Christians around the world are being attacked and often killed by Muslims, who are carrying out these acts of terrorism in the name of Islam.</p>
<p>The Social Contract, a quarterly journal on public policy, recently released a special issue on &#8220;The Menace of Islam.&#8221; The twenty-one contributions detail:</p>
<p>* That Islam is not, in fact, a true religion. It is an intolerant ideological cult that seeks to subjugate the world to Shariah Islamic law and condemn all non-Muslims to second-class status.</p>
<p>* There is no such thing as &#8220;moderate Islam .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a religion of peace.&#8221; Islam itself is the problem.</p>
<p>* Wall Street is actively promoting Shariah finance in the United States.</p>
<p>* Federal immigration policy places America at risk. An estimated 5 million visa violators include transnational criminals and terrorists. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE) employs only 272 special agents to locate and arrest them.</p>
<p>* Muslim immigration should be stopped for national security reasons. An ever-growing number of naturalized and native-born Muslim terrorists demonstrate that Muslims as a group pose an intolerable risk to the peace and security of our country.</p>
<p>Editor Wayne Lutton is available for media interviews (231-347-1171).<br>

		<p>After 9/11, I saw that there was no scaling back of Middle Eastern immigration and I realized that they were just being treated like an even more protected class than before (religion of peace). It made no sense to me to allow so many potential terrorists into our country unless the US government wants to use them as terrorist bogey men against the native-born population while allowing them to establish a Islamic beachhead in the USA (Dearborn, MI). I&rsquo;d be just fine with a complete moratorium all immigration, but this should have never been allowed to happen in the first place.        </p>

		<p>Just like America&rsquo;s primary objective for from 1950 to 1980 was to stop Communism cold, our primary purpose today should be against the even greater threat of Islam.</p>
<p>Both Communism and Islam are all-controlling, social and economic life-philosophies that stifle individualism and creativity, and impose absolute adherence to a confining set of social and economic rules.  Both lead to stagnation, poverty, and social misery   &mdash;   a life devoid of joy. However, among the 2, Islam is much, much worse.  Imagine being a woman or homosexual, or scientists, or artist, or intellectual in an Islamic society.  Imagine having to pray 5 times a day, and being told when to eat, what to eat, how to dress, how long your hair and beard should be, when and whom to marry, who should drive and who should not drive, what music, movies and art you cannot see, etc.  At least under Communism people were allowed to eat and marry as they saw fit. Being a Muslim is like living in the 10th Century!</p>
<p>We fought tooth-and-nail against Communists. We forbade them from immigrating.  We deported them. We searched them out. We removed them from their jobs and threw them in jail. Our CIA assassinated them. We fought several wars against them.  100,000 Americans died fighting Communism.   Yet, even though Islam is far, far worse than Communism, our government does nothing to protect us from this vile threat.  In fact, our government imports tens of thousands of Muslims, annually. </p>
<p>It is time for our government to work for the welfare of American Citizens, for a change.  End immigration of Muslims now!  Muslims have over 40 Islamic countries in which they can live.  Let them live in peace in their own lands.  I wish them luck.  They do not need to live here.  </p>

		<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t matter if every inhabitant of North Africa and Asia Minor converted from Islam to Christianity.</p>
<p>The threat is the movement of non-white Eastern races into white lands. Religion is a convenient way to group them, but everyone should be aware that race encroachment is the real issue.</p>

		<p>In 2004, after American forces captured Khalid Sheik Mohammed in Afghanistan, they got some information out of him, the most surprising being that AQ wanted to attack Japan when it and South Korean co-hosted the World Cup of Soccer in 2002.  KSM said that AQ gave it up when they realized they could never get a &#8220;ground network&#8221; up and running in Japan.  That&rsquo;s all they told us, but the reason AQ could never get a &#8220;ground network&#8221; of their people going in Japan is because Japan wouldn&rsquo;t allow them to immigrate there and take permanent enough residency.</p>

		<p>If America had maintained its&rsquo; national origins immigration policy after 1965 and if muslims had been completely excluded from entering America, 9/11 would never have occured.</p>
<p>The most effective way to prevent another terrorist attack on American soil is to immediately implement a national origins immigration policy that completely excludes muslims&hellip;.this in addition to deporting muslims back their nations of origin.</p>
<p><br>
There are no economic,ecological,cultural and demographic reasons for importing millions of high fertility muslims into America.</p>
<p>How did Native Born White America manage to survive all those years when the muslim population was very small? Very well thank you.</p>

<p>Wow, really? I think the editor and writers here could have told y&rsquo;all that twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, if we had banned muslim immigration twenty years ago, we could have reasonably averted 9/11.</p>

<p>Not enough, we must also ostracize and deport any U.S. citizen converts too! they are becoming an increasing danger to American citizens.</p>

<p>Well, the new Congress can start the restoration of the Immigration profile system in use from 1924-1965, as it&rsquo;s first act.</p>
<p>I know a LOT of people would be VERY happy. And those that aren&rsquo;t, No Hablo Ingles, anyway.</p>

		<p>The greedy cheating class-corporate CEO,Republican and Democratic polticians-are repsonsible for the expansion of Islam in America. And they have given an economic justifiction for it. They claim that America needs to import muslim physicians,engineers,computer programmers,construction workers,plumbers,truck drivers&hellip;..any occupation you can name&hellip; because if America didn&rsquo;t import muslim immigrants into  America, it wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fill these jobs.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a complete bold-face lie. If shutting down all post-1965 nonwhite high fertility  legal immigration to 0 resulted in a very severe labor scarcity, it would be a wonderfull thing for it would result in a much higher real wage for millions of Native Born White Americans. I never came across  labor scarcity I didn&rsquo;t like. The more severe the better. But labor scarcities scare the greedy cheating class.Labor scarcities mean an end to the massive transfer off wealth from millions of ordinary Native Born White Americans to the mega rich upper class.  It is this fear that drives the race-replacement enthusiasm of the greedy cheating class and thier puppets in the Republican nd Democratic parties.</p>
<p>There is no economic jusification for the race-replacement of the Native Born White Majority with high fertility Muslim immigrants&hellip;it is all one big lie.</p>
<p>Liberal enthusiasm for race-replacing Native Born White Americans with post-1965 high fertility young Muslim legal immigrants lead directly to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the mass murder of US servicemen and women at Fort Hood by a legal immigrant muslim Colonel in the US Army. The US military has made it very clear that it would like to have thousand of Muslims in the US military. This is in-your-face-teason. The US Military is not to be trusted.</p>

		<p>When the lying, greedy elites say that, &#8220;Immigration improves the economy,&#8221;  what they really mean is, &#8220;I can make lots more money in my company by firing American Citizen-workers, and replacing them with low-salary, foreign wage-slaves.  Also, if the population booms, I can sell lots more big-screen TV&rsquo;s, SUV&rsquo;s and high-priced tennis shoes.&#8221;   </p>
<p>It is all about greed, folks.  Those greedy, rich SOB&rsquo;s make money by replacing us, and packing more foreign consumers into our over-crowded cities.  Sure this causes stress, crime, social problems, destroys the ecology, and bankrupts the government via welfare, medical, school, policing, incarceration, Section 8 housing, etc.  But what do they care?  They live in gated Miami Beach or in Italy or the south of France.  </p>
<p>Their motto is: Privatize profits - socialize costs.</p>
