<h1>The DHS Memorandum</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>&ldquo;Federale,&rdquo; federaleagent86.blogspot.com, January 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There has been much controversy concerning the Department of Homeland Security memorandum concerning the connection between Jared Loughner and the publication American Renaissance. Many are suggesting that the whole memorandum obtained by Fox is a fabrication, but I think that the originating memorandum is real. Real despite the glowing factual errors that many have pointed out.</p>
<p>From the memorandum, a copy of which has yet to be released:<blockquote>{snip} the suspect has multiple arrests .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But no criminal record? Intervention by someone?* no direct connection  &mdash;  but strong suspicion is being directed at AmRen / American Renaissance. Suspect is possibly linked to this group. (through videos posted on his myspace and YouTube account.). The group&rsquo;s ideology is anti government, anti immigration, anti ZOG (Zionist Occupational Government), anti Semitic. Gabrielle Gifford is the first Jewish female elected to such a high position in the US government. {snip}<br>
</blockquote>{snip} [This] is more likely an email alert going out from what Jared Taylor of American Renaissance identified as the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center, AcTIC, one of the hundreds of fusion centers like the fusion center responsible for the Missouri embarrassment, all funded by DHS and run under FBI auspices and direction.</p>
<p>Much of the training provided to the flatfoots assigned to these centers is of very low quality and highly politically correct. Most of the staff is the dregs of local, state and federal law enforcement. High performing officers, agents, and detectives are not given these assignements, as they produce no arrests or statistics. The fusion centers consider themselves to be the lead on counter terrorism investigations, but they are mostly just information clearing houses, filled with alot of dated, useless, misleading, incomplete, and false information gleaned from where ever. {snip} The only real use for such widely spread information is profiling. Here it is effective in combating &#8220;one off&#8221; or copy cat terrorists. But, since profiling is not allowed, it is of limited effectiveness, but it does make local Sheriffs and Chiefs Of Police feel important because they have detailed a non-performing employee to the fusion center. It should also be noted that their training is heavy on SPLC propaganda and the Islam is a religion of peace propaganda.</p>
<p>So the nonsense, out right lies, and plain factual errors are quite likely to be coming from AcTIC. {snip}</p>
<p>Which, in the end, is the purpose of FBI control over the work product of the fusion centers. Just like their Joint Terrorism Task Forces, it is designed to make the FBI appear to be sharing information with the locals, make the FBI look good, gather information for the FBI, or take credit for any accomplishments. In this case, fusion centers, are a way to pawn off politically connected Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police, who would only interfer with or ruin a real FBI counter-terrorism investigation.</p>
<p>But you really know that the memorandum is real from the prominent mention of non-FBI agencies as leading or participating in the investigation:</p>
<p>&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. working together, was MCSO, DPS, Phoenix PD, ICE, and of course the FBI.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the FBI has taken over the investigation and they don&rsquo;t play with others. And there is no jurisdiction for the Arizona Department of Public Safety as DPS is a highway patrol agency, and ICE has no interest or jurisdiction, they only deal with customs and immigration matters. And why would Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office be involved if this happened in another county?</p>
<p>So, clearly this memorandum was written by some useless flatfoot hack with ADL/SPLC connections and training. {snip}<br>

		<p>The irony is that he ended up being left-wing and Jewish, so basically wrong on all counts.</p>
<p>American Renaissance was mentioned as being anti-Government and anti-&#8216;ZOG&rsquo;, and anti-Semitic. I personally don&rsquo;t think it is any of these. Most White people realise that government in some form is necessary because the alternative is anarchy and that has never &#8216;worked&rsquo;. The &#8216;White Separatist&rsquo; members also realise that after separation a new government would need to be formed.</p>
<p>As for ZOG, American Renaissance is one of the few &#8216;White Nationalist&rsquo; groups that welcomes those of the Jewish faith. As a Jewish member of American Renaissance I have seen no anti-Semitic references in their articles nor have I see the claim that the Government is run by Zionists or &#8216;Jews&rsquo; (this is not a term we have used to describe ourselves since the end of WW2, and is an easy way of seeing if an article is written by someone who isn&rsquo;t Jewish).</p>

		<p>Factual error in this article:  Arizona DPS has law enforcement jurisdiction over the whole state.</p>
<p>Personal opinion:  A fly on the wall told me in an e-mail that he halfway wishes that this was done in Maricopa County instead of Pima County, because Sheriff Joe Arpaio would have made his jail stay sufficiently uncomfortable until he started duly cooperating.  Sheriff Bigmouth of Tucson isn&rsquo;t doing any of that, because he&rsquo;s too busy covering his own business and that of the suspect&rsquo;s mother.</p>

		<p>All news organizations have direct lines to the ADL and SPLC. The ADL and SPLC actually write press releases that these organizations simply copy and paste.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something the MSM should be investigating; their own complicity in relying on self-serving, biased organizations to write their news reports.</p>

		<p>I guess the idea of the New American Robot is flawed?<br>
Where in the world do these posters to AR think they have any right to speak their mind. Most are White Devils who sleep with the American Constitution under their pillow. People like these who feel they can have an opinion that does fit in with the Obama Bin Lyin crowd. Where do they come off with this madness. Yet somehow feeling up grannies at the airport and not allowing finger nail clippers will keep us safe?<br>
Step back folks let these people with their faces covered and in burkas pass through, they are not white so they don&rsquo;t need to be scrutinized by home security.</p>

		<p>Yup, that memorandum had the SPLC&rsquo;s paw prints all over it, just like the notorious MIAC report.  The one thing I can feel confident of is that the SPLC&rsquo;s unholy involvement with the DHS will not result in a single act of genuine terrorism being thwarted.  After all, the mad bombers are almost never in the categories the SPLC obsesses about.</p>

		<p>I was 21 when Kennedy was assassinated.  Despite the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald  was:</p>
<p>1 A communist from his teens.  He was recruited in Brooklyn NYC during the Rosenberg trials when every liberal in the country was defending the Rosenbergs.</p>
<p>2  Began to learn Russian in his teens and defected to Russia as soon as he got out of the army.</p>
<p>3  Married a Russian woman who was raised by her uncle a colonel in the Russian versian of the FBI who fit the profile of a typical sleeper agent.</p>
<p>4  Attempted to assassinate a right wing retired general who led and anti school desegregation movement.  Sat in the black section of New Orleans buses and generally let everybody know he was a radical and communist.</p>
<p>Despite all this, just about every book and article that came out for 30 years blamed the assanation on the CIA, FBI, K, oil companies and right wing hateful citizens of Dallas. I don&rsquo;t think any books came out before about 1995 admitted that Oswald&rsquo;s lifelong communism might turn him against President Kennedy to campaigned as an anti communist cold warrior and was embroiled with all sorts of disputes with communist Cuba at the time Oswald shot him.</p>
<p>Someone mentioned that all the mainstream media does is accept press releases from various organizations.  It is all too true.  Nowdays they are emailed and just clicked by the editors to the printers.  I doubt the press releases are even read before put into the paper.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s using language that I agree with, language that is necessary to get a point across and make people sit up and take notice.</p>
<p>The left is VERY effective at using this strategy.</p>
<p>We have some excellent posters on here with the courage to tell it like it is, but some are so wimpish they feel as if they have to apologize to the opposition when they criticize them, which only emboldens them more. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not buying the latest story out of DHS.  Pinning the blame on AcTIC reeks of damage control and shifting the blame so that DHS can save face from their ham handed attempt to link Amren&rsquo;s race realist positions with the actions of a madman like Jared Loughner. </p>
<p>From what I can tell the DHS &#8220;leak&#8221; seems to have backfired with everyone except elements of the left wing lunatic fringe who see nazis hiding under every mattress and in every closet.  </p>

		<p>DHS is run by a political hack who originally supported Hillary and was made some offer she could not refuse and then changed her backing to Pres O. NOT a person with even the remotest background to run DHS or any such analogous organization.</p>
<p>Sun Tzu would say and did say that DHS needs to be run by someone professional above the usual political concerns. NOT what we have now.</p>

<p>The fashionable theory why Obama would send Napolitano to a cabinet job so out of her league is that this was his reward to McCain for essentially surrendering the election in mid-September.  In late 2008, it was thought that she was McCain&rsquo;s only real roadblock to another term in the Senate, as she would have been ending her second and constitutionally last term as Governor in 2010, so a run for Senate would have been a &#8220;free play&#8221; for her.  But she was at HLS.  And nobody foresaw J.D. Hayworth coming out of nowhere and at least giving McCain some competition in the primary.</p>

Law enforcement agencies  are equally submissive. They also have connections with those same non-government organizations which, despite their non-official status, are able to wield tremendous clout and get their way.</p>

		<p>You missed a few details about Lee Harvey Oswald, Anonymous 7.  </p>
<p>Oswald left the marines early, saying that his mother needed care in order to get a hardship discharge, which must have been a lie, since he travelled to the USSR right away instead of moving back home to her; he must have been planning his trip there from an early date.  In the USSR, his grooming as a sleeper agent began almost immediately; while working in Minsk as a lathe operator, he received a fully subsidized apartment in a good building and extra pay - hardly the standard of living normal for Russian industrial workers.  </p>
<p>On return to the US, Oswald purchased his rifle and a S&W; Model 10 revolver using forged identification with the surname Hidell; presumably he forged the ID while working at a Dallas graphics art company in their photoprint department; among the documents he forged under the name Hidell was a fake draft card.  His first attempted assassination was Major General Walker because of Walker&rsquo;s membership in the John Birch Society - hardly the sort of organization in which membership would inspire a &#8220;right-winger&#8221; to try to kill someone.</p>
<p>On August 9, 1963, Oswald was arrested in New orleans for brawling with several men who objected to his handing out pro-Castro fliers on a streetcorner.  Again, hardly the work of a right-wing sympathizer.</p>
<p>Shortly before the Kennedy assassination, Oswald travelled to Mexico City, where he apparently met several times with Cuban and KGB officials there while trying to get a Cuban entrance visa.  Fidel Castro had previously publically announced that given the CIA&rsquo;s attempts to assassinate him, US leaders could no longer consider themselves safe from the same treatment.  Oswald himself was as you&rsquo;ve shown, easy to classify; the only truly bizarre aspect to the whole assassination is why someone would pick a Mannlicher Carcano to do it and why military FMJ ammunition would be preferable to softnosed hunting ammo, with which a head shot would be far less necessary to ensure a kill.  A .303&#8221; Enfield (either a No. I Mk-III or a No. 4) would have been just as cheap at the time and have a faster action and better accuracy.  Moreover, at 88 yards distance, why use a telescopic sight, especially one with skinny optics that - due to the narrow field of view - would make it hard to quickly reacquire the target after bringing the gun back down out of recoil?  I could have done that shoot with an Enfield over iron sights in my sleep.</p>
<p>Jedderman said above that DHS needs to be run by someone professional above the usual political concerns.  One could also say the same thing about the CIA.  President Oogabooga appointed as his CIA director Leon Panetta, a career politician with no intelligence experience whatsoever, who&rsquo;s sum total of military experience was two years as an army lieutenant some 45 years ago, and who&rsquo;s only qualification is that he was the correct political flavor.</p>
