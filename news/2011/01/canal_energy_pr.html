			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marcelle Hanemann, Daily News (Washington Parish, Louisiana), January 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A clearly angry Steve Fetter, president of Canal Energy and Services, which was hit with a lawsuit for alleged racial discrimination in hiring just before Christmas, denied any wrongdoing and said he&rsquo;s pulling his company out of Bogalusa because of people like the plaintiffs in the federal suit. He also warned that his business would not be the only one lost to the city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the suit 15 African-American plaintiffs claim that they applied for jobs advertised by Canal Energy, and that the company screened applicants to determine race and sometimes marked the applications of African-Americans with the letter &#8220;B&#8221; &#8220;for black.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit also alleges that Canal had a &#8220;policy and practice&#8221; of refusing to hire African Americans, and that Fetter advised his executive assistant that he did not want to hire them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;These people were positively not qualified for any position in the oilfield,&#8221; he [Fetter] said. &#8220;And the BP (British Petroleum) incident showed the consequences of having inexperienced people offshore.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as Chrysler left Bogalusa, Canal Energy is going to leave Bogalusa and there will never, ever be a successful oilfield operation in the city as long as the people in the city have their hands out and want something for nothing,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>Exactly that was my dream.<br>
Companies starting to think! Like Jared Taylor once said in a interview, Companies always tried (and still try) to bring more Third worlders into white countries to dump down the loans. However they have never thought about the fact that the cities will get ruined, the schools dumped down, the infrastructure will collapse because all money will go to welfare and low IQ will lead to a lack of good workers.</p>
<p>But the most direct thing hitting the companies will always be laws against discrimination. This will teach companies why it is better to have only one race in the country.</p>

		<p>Look for some race hustling Phd candidate, black or White, doesn&rsquo;t really matter, they sound alike, to get an instant doctorate and immediate lifetime tenure for writing an essay on how the evil Whitey business fled Diversity and the town suffered as a result of evil Whitey&rsquo;s abandonment of civil responsibility to Diversity Inclusion and Equality.</p>
<p>Whatever happens bad in Bogalusa from now on will be blamed on the evil Whitey who didn&rsquo;t stick around to suffer through the misery of the Diversity Curse. </p>
<p>Whitey is always wrong, and that&rsquo;s all you need to say to get good pay jobs in schools and colleges.</p>

		<p>This man Fetter is an anachronism.  Telling it like it is without regard to political correctness.  How I enjoy reading articles like this.  I hope Fetter has deep pockets and a good legal team, especially once the Obama&rsquo;s IRS and the US Department of Black Justice start poking around down there.</p>

		<p>I wonder how long it will be before black people show up at hospitals and demand jobs as &#8220;Doctors&#8221; even though they don&rsquo;t have any medical training and then file lawsuits when they are turned down?</p>

		<p>Surely this white bigot is mistaken.  Black people are always qualified for every position regardless of skills or education.  If a black person is turned down for a job, the reason must be racism on the part of the employer, at least this is what black race hustlers and their white leftist enablers try to make us believe. Good for this man and his company for telling the truth. </p>

		<p>I stop doing business with any company that panders to blacks and/or discriminates against whites. That is why I have never purchased an American made car. All of the Big Three practice affirmative action quotas and are anti-white to the core.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of an incident a few years ago in Zimbabwe, at a company which was a major employer, the largest paper merchant in the southern hemisphere. A delegation of &#8220;comrades&#8221; presented management with a list of demands - all White managers to be replaced by blacks, a list of all employees who were opposition party supporters, etc.</p>
<p>The management held a meeting, and before the close of business announced their decision. Everybody could go home - the company had just gone out of business.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s executive action.</p>

		<p>I wonder!! can the federal government FORCE a company to remain in a city no matter how their bottom line may suffer? Holder and his Department of Blackness will soon be making that determination.</p>
