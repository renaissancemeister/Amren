			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KCBS-TV (Los Angeles), January 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A teacher at Oakland&rsquo;s Markham Elementary School has been suspended indefinitely after school officials said a pair of second-graders performed sex acts on each other in class  &mdash;  with the teacher present.</p>
<p>{snip}; both incidents occurred last week in the same classroom but he said they didn&rsquo;t come to the attention of school officials until Wednesday.</p>
<p>In one case, several students apparently took off their clothes and were naked in the classroom. In the second incident, a boy and girl reportedly engaged in oral sex in front of their classmates.</p>
<p>Flint [Troy Flint, the spokesman for the Oakland Unified School District] indicated that the suspended teacher, whose name was not released by the school district, was present for both of the incidents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a letter sent to parents of Markham students on Thursday, Booker offered an apology by telling them that the incidents &#8220;represent an unacceptable lack of supervision. I understand there is great anger over this news.&#8221;<br>

		<p>It least some of these little kids told. White kids are too afraid to say anything. That&rsquo;s the programming. Then the calls for integration. In the words of the late Sam Francis, &#8220;when aggression meets submission the result is annihilation&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Not surprising at all. The Oakland Unified School District made headlines in 1996 when they endorsed the teaching of Ebonics.</p>
<p>And if the children were nude in class there should be an investigation to see if the teacher was a pervert who instigated this.   </p>

		<p>When I was in 5th grade,there was a black kid who was well liked by all students, regardless of race.There was a teacher (white) who taught 5th grade, and she was quite attractive. He made the most provocative, sexual, lewd, and promiscous remarks about her.They mature early sexually, dont they?</p>

		<p>This is not surprising knowing what a lot of black children and, maybe slightly less, hispanic children are exposed to in the home. Or should I say the hood. It&rsquo;s a more accurate description.</p>
<p>The sad part of all this is OUR culture is being infected by this. The more they &#8220;diversify&#8221; our schools, neighborhoods and workplaces, the more we are being pulled down to their level. Just look at the shows on TV and the movies that are made. All pushing this agenda. With a lot of the advertisers denigrating white people while TV and movies glorify the gansta-hood lifestyle. </p>

		<p>I taught kindergarten in an all black school on the south side of Chicago. One day I had the children seated at the tables. I was circulating among he tables and helping students with their work. Across the room, a little girl got out of her seat, crawled under the table and kissed a little boy between the legs. When I told the grandmother about it, she seemed unsurprised and mumbled something about the mother&rsquo;s influence. I think I saw the mother once the whole school year, and she appeared to be high at the time.  On another occasion, a little boy emerged from the bathroom and informed me &#8220;Reginald showed me his thing and told me to&hellip;&hellip;&#8221;  I could go on with more examples. It is truly disgusting that these parents don&rsquo;t see anything wrong in exposing their very young children to such explicit sexual acts. I am out of teaching now, and am so happy and relieved to be pursuing a second career.    </p>

<p>QD, I take it that as a teenager you were passionate about girls and also about automobiles. Reading your post, I felt I was reading about how the car you mentioned works, rather than, you know. :)</p>
<p>Was the teacher in the room when this incident occurred? I assume not. I only remember my teacher leaving the room once when I was in grade school, and another boy and I took the opportunity to get in a fight that bounced all over the room.</p>
<p>Maybe there HAS been some progress.</p>

		<p>the incidents &ldquo;represent an unacceptable lack of supervision.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have kids that are the same age as the pupils in this article and they often have friends their age over to visit.  Sometimes, while they are playing video games or otherwise occupied with meaningful play, I am off in another room doing some kind of housework.  I have never once stumbled upon any of them engaged in sexual activity when they believed that I wasn&rsquo;t watching them. I suppose in this day and age, my kids are considered &#8220;babies,&#8221; hardly even concerned with gender difference, but I prefer it that way. I can&rsquo;t even imagine what a sexually obsessed second grader must be like. It&rsquo;s far beyond my ability to even comprehend such an awful thing.</p>
<p>I can only assume that the pupils of Markham are imitating behavior they see (or even worse, engage in) in their own filthy homes. </p>

		<p>In response to some previous comments: black children do, on the average, mature faster than white ones.  Moreover, kids of any age and maturity can mimic the actions of adults, including sexual behavior.  Anyone can go through the motions of oral sex on anyone else, whether or not there is any bodily response.  These students may have been merely putting on a show for fellow pupils.  The teacher may have been asleep.</p>

		<p>QD - is THAT what most stands out to you?  The mechanics of it?  The how of it?<br>
Completely misses the point.  The HOW is not the issue.  The WHY is the issue, the fact that it happened IN THE CLASSROOM WITH THE TEACHER PRESENT, and the fact this was SECOND GRADE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.  Are you a parent?  Do you have kids?<br>
Are you not OUTRAGED that this happened at all, and can you not see it results from public schools being allowed to &#8220;discuss&#8221; sexual topics with CHILDREN now down to the grade school level.  A policy which is geared entirely to &#8220;normalizing&#8221; homosexuality but allows heterosexual and homosexual perverts and pedophiles to promote this activity under the guise of &#8220;sexual education&#8221;.  It was only a matter of time before something like this happened and we will see more of it.<br>

		<p>7 HD:  The answer is yes, but my interest in girls and cars as a teenager was below average by my high school&rsquo;s standards, which wasn&rsquo;t and still isn&rsquo;t the typical high school itself, so I was actually way behind the curve as far as that goes.</p>
<p>10 Bill R:  Of course I&rsquo;m outraged, but other people have outlined that way better than I could.  That conversation about mechanics is the only thing of value I could add, because I knew the question of how could a 7- or 8-year old boy (even a black boy   &mdash;   They do mature earlier than whites, but not that much earlier) could do his &#8220;part&#8221; in that particular act.  Of course we know that this was the end result of years and years of &#8220;condoms on cucumbers&#8221; exercises, kindergarten sex ed, a consummately rotted-out popular culture, and lest we forget, all these kids have lived their lives in the era of humanity of oral sex not really being sex, thank you Bill Clinton.  His first Surgeon General couldn&rsquo;t find a sex topic, which twenty years prior would have been restrained to the soundproof walls of a Masters &amp; Johnson clinic, that she didn&rsquo;t want to peddle to 5-year olds.  So you&rsquo;re right   &mdash;   Society begs them to do this sort of thing, then we wonder why they do, and they wonder why we&rsquo;re so outraged when they do.  Add to it the obvious but taboo racial factor, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why this incident was in a heavily black and Hispanic school, and why future ones will most likely be. </p>
<p>Similarly, there was a story from just up the road in Sacramento this past week   &mdash;   The admins at a high school are selling the parents of students drug tests for a quarter on the dollar.  The reason is that a survey of the school&rsquo;s students show that half of them are doing week.  I thought to myself   &mdash;   Pardon me, but you dismiss weed usage as a &ldquo;choice&rdquo; akin to picking out boxes of cereal in the supermarket, you advertise weed as having &ldquo;medicinal value,&rdquo; (when the medicinal compounds have already been isolated into a prescription drug called Marinol/Dronabinol), you support most if not all efforts to legalize the stuff and/or make it less of a criminal offense, you vote for politicians who will govern out of that very city, who will either de jure or de facto legalize it (Brown/Newsom/Harris), you want amnesty and open borders so that the peddlers and manufacturers of this stuff have easy passage across the fiction formerly known as the Mexican border, and you demand the increased neutering of law enforcement, under the guise of &ldquo;civil rights,&rdquo; to preclude the enforcement of the fewer and fewer laws concerning weed you would have left on the books.  It&rsquo;s amazing to me that the whole damned school isn&rsquo;t doing weed at this rate, it&rsquo;s perhaps a miracle that it&rsquo;s ONLY half the school.</p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
This lewd  behavior toward a teacher is not acceptable at ANY age! This has to do with a lot more than just maturation.  </p>
<p>He doubtless picked up this attitude in the &#8220;black community&#8221; where this sort of thing is considered standard and quite the acceptable thing to do.  </p>
<p>They have a whole different culture. We and they are two different peoples.</p>

		<p>I work with school-age blacks and latinos and they are hyper-sexualized in a shocking way.  The girls come in dressed like hoochies, and when we call the mothers (for there are rarely fathers to call) the mothers come in dressed the same and ask what&rsquo;s wrong!</p>
<p>The way that black boys will go up to ANY female, even ones they don&rsquo;t know, and start touching, fondling and sweet talking is out of this world looney-bins.  Latino kids as young as middle school are very sexually active, and statistics (and all the pregger students around us) constantly prove this fact.</p>
<p>We staff members (the white ones) complain about it to ourselves, but we mostly don&rsquo;t even bother reporting any sexualized or hoochie-like behavior to our supervisors anymore (all bosses where I&rsquo;m at are non-white, by the way) because nothing happens and some of our numbers have been targeted as &#8216;culturally insensitive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Every (white) teacher I know dejectedly says the same thing: America is finished.  The rest of the public, and some overly-optimistic posters here, don&rsquo;t realize it.  Come work in the trenches with us, with the children who will be the majority in this land in less than 20 years.</p>

		<p>Just like kids 10 years ago imitated WWF moves they watched on TV, sometimes with deadly results, these kids are mimicking what they&rsquo;re seeing on TV, the Internet and in their own homes.</p>
<p>I know this because kids at school tell me the TV set at home is turned to porn, often hard-core porn, and left on 24/7 for all to see.  Kids also tell me hard-core porn magazines are left out at home too, and no one cares if they look at them or not  The type of &#8216;parents&rsquo; or &#8216;parent&rsquo; of kids like this do not care what the kid watches or listens to or sees and doesn&rsquo;t bother to turn on parental controls.</p>
<p>I also strongly suspect a lot of these kids have witnessed these types of acts openly in their own homes.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there is the abuse issue&hellip;..which also makes small children much more aware and &#8221;sophisticated&#8221; about intimate issues than they would be otherwise.</p>
<p>For example, the reports from kids abused by Michael Jackson.</p>

		<p>The blatant, physical, consequences of the sex act are obvious.  Some can even be mitigated to the extent that it is hard to argue a concept of abstinence to fully pubescent teenagers (courtesy the enormously high saturated fat content of our present diet, whites are now chasing blacks ever more closely&hellip;).</p>
<p>But I believe that there is a hidden, less obvious but even more critical, consequence to early sexual promiscuity: epigenetics.  </p>
<p>You see something as you watch others do it or at least &#8216;practice for it&rsquo; and some part of your mind quietly imprints this fact as a new weighting standard of what to expect in life as a norm.</p>
<p>HAR-F1 genetics (brain-to-gonads straight shot connection) then takes over and as fast as &#8216;Hey whaddya know!&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a new expectation for you personally too.</p>
<p>The problem being that puberty changes the way the child brain functions from emulating a sponge that absorbs everything to being a filter that manipulates it&rsquo;s own identity-sense of the environment to gain what it wants rather than needs.</p>
<p>We call this adolescence and don&rsquo;t expect or want it to begin _at 8 years old_.</p>
<p>Because the result of early onset sexualization is your fluid intelligence begins to recede in the face of crystallized intelligence.  And blacks are nothing if not masters of the art of shystering and manipulation -because- their mental functions harden earlier.  Under a flood of testosterone which has them functionally adult in their ability to learn as much as their external biometrics, as young as 14 years old.</p>
<p>This in turn being a major element in their overall IQ deficit of 1MSD from ours.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a wide ranging set of fluid-IQ imprinted principles as educated wisdom, in whites, a lot of our nominal edge in IQ over the other races may vanish.</p>
<p>This is what I consider to be the learning psychology reality behind the purely instinctive horror of something so &#8216;morally offensive&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Our kids must stay kids for long enough to get a full dose of IQ improvement over their competitor ethnies.  ONLY then will we be able to remain apart and atop our own social pyramid.</p>
<p>Our edge is not physical.  It comes later.  From the mind.</p>

		<p>15:  Michio Kaku is probably not an expert on epigenetics, but I have heard him say in the past that the best say for society to find the next generation of great scientists is to push exceptionally bright children, especially boys, in the approximately three years before they hit puberty.  His reasoning is that after puberty, the opposite gender becomes too much of a distraction for adolescents, and adult scientists are just too bogged down in paperwork and other personal responsibilities to be able to learn too well.  It might be what you said more than that, that the postpubescent human brain isn&rsquo;t able to learn as well.</p>

		<p>There was a case here in Bucks County, a predominately White  upscale area in southeastern Pennsylvania where 5 Middle school teachers (all White, three women and two men) were caught kissing and foidling more than a dozen 6th and 7th graders last fall.</p>
<p>Needless to say, they were all fired and prosecuted. They all received sentences ranging from 5 to 7 years. Two of the offenders will have 6 years of additional probation once they are released from prison.</p>
<p>Teachers regardless of race, are becoming a major danger to our chlidren. they need to start doing more through background checks and/or psychological evaluations on teachgers before they hire them to teach our kids!   </p>

<p>I know nothing about that case, but I have to wonder how much of this is genuine &#8220;molestation&#8221;, apart from just an affectionate pat on the head that&rsquo;s been grossly misinterpreted. <br>
 <br>
There was a rash of cases like this, across the nation, about twenty years ago. It was a mania, like  spreading wildfire.  Many innocent people were caught up in it and had their lives ruined.</p>
<p>For that reason, I would never, never want any job dealing with chidren. It&rsquo;s poison.  And if you do have one, never touch a child (in any way) or show any kind of fondness.  It&rsquo;s sad, but that&rsquo;s how it is.</p>

<p>Anon #17</p>
<p>Could you please post a link.  I hadn&rsquo;t heard about this story, was curious, and launched a google search.  I could only come up with the following, from 2007:</p>
<p><i>A Central Bucks substitute teacher and community swim coach is in prison today after being charged with having sex with two Tohickon Middle School ninth graders in the home of one of the girls.</i></p>
<p>This particular substitute teacher later committed suicide.</p>
<p>And this from Lancaster PA, 2010:</p>
<p><i>A high school teacher in the School District of Lancaster has been charged in connection with having sexual contact with a student.</i></p>
<p>I could find no instance of multiple teachers &#8216;kissing and fondling more than a dozen  6th and 7th graders&rsquo;, being fired, and each sentenced to 5 to 7 years in prison.</p>
<p>Seems like this would have been a huge story nationwide, as even one teacher caught in <i>in flagrante delicto</i> is usually a pretty big story, especially if it involves a female teacher.  Hell, Lifetime has even made TV movies of the week about single female teachers caught with male students.</p>
<p>And as for:  <i>Teachers regardless of race, are becoming a major danger to our children they need to start doing more through background checks and/or psychological evaluations</i></p>
<p>This is the requirement for Pennsylvania:</p>
<p><i>Teachers, administrators and other educational personnel working directly with students in public and private Pennsylvania schools are subject to state-mandated background checks. These checks consist of criminal history, child abuse, and federal criminal clearances&hellip; this background check requires a fingerprint scan.</i></p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/4mtv9xh</p>
<p>This is how it is in California as well.</p>
<p>Oh, and we teacher have to pay for our own background checks AND fingerprinting.</p>
<p>Wish background checks were required of students AND their parents, so many of whom are psychotic and dangerous these days, before <b>they</b> are unleashed upon the schools.</p>

		<p>This is nauseating and appalling. Kids will do what is reflected in their world and often what they are encouraged to do by adults, so even if children have inappropriate examples set before them at home, there is no reason other than teacher encouragement that they would be acting in such a way at school while the teacher was present. This is clear and obvious pedophilia, and should be prosecuted as such. Investigations into the involved children&rsquo;s home life should be undertaken.</p>
<p>This is just one more flagrant example of what I&rsquo;ve been saying about the degenerative direction of our society: those kids who were unsupervised, undisciplined and badly neglected by parents in being taught values, morals, character and responsibility are now grown themselves, in the workforce and bringing up their own children. Therefore, the work environment and quality of work/workers is suffering. It&rsquo;s now no better than the trash that is being passed of as today&rsquo;s kids. Absolutely there are some exceptions, thank God, but they are overwhelmingly in the minority.</p>

		<p>I taught in a primarily black school - first grade.  One year.  And that was all it took for me to see that the ghetto kids ARE in fact much more violent and much more sexually aware than other kids of the same age.  It doesn&rsquo;t say what the race of these 2 Oakland kids are, but what they know at age 6, kids from other backgrounds don&rsquo;t know until age 12.  What I saw as &#8220;business as usual&#8221; at that school sickened me, and I left after one year.  I then taught in a barrio area, and while that had its drawbacks, it did NOT have kids who were anywhere near as violent or sexually aware as the kids at the ghetto school.  The worst thing that happened at the barrio school was that one of my 5th grade girls, a white girl who had been raped by her brother, was caught behind the trash bins having sex with an Hispanic 6th grader.  While this isn&rsquo;t wonderful, it at least is more age-appropriate behavior than the sexual language and body language of the ghetto school first graders.  None of it is OK in my book - but parents, be aware of what&rsquo;s out there if you send your white kids to a public school.  HOME SCHOOL them, no matter what kind of sacrifices you have to make.  It&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

		<p>As for my humble person, in 2nd grade I learned to swear in three languages other than mine, and how to handle a switchblade. Porn was ubiquitous, but of the cheap paper variety. Indeed, I had to wait for high school to have four (white!) classmates gang-rape a girl just because she was small, shy, and Iranian.<br>
- I would not wish any of that on my children. But I have to agree with #15 Anonymous and #16 Question Diversity that during puberty boys and girls should be separated (as our middle school was integrated only from 7th grade, I have seen the rise in violence and the drop in learning first-hand).</p>

		<p>There was a case here in Bucks County, a predominately White upscale area in southeastern Pennsylvania where 5 Middle school teachers (all White, three women and two men) were caught kissing and foidling more than a dozen 6th and 7th graders last fall.</p>
<p>Needless to say, they were all fired and prosecuted. They all received sentences ranging from 5 to 7 years. Two of the offenders will have 6 years of additional probation once they are released from prison</p>
<p><br>
The sickos will be lucky if they survive and make it out of prison.</p>

		<p>The amazing thing about this story isnt that 8 yr old bucks are starting their raping behaviours. The amazing thing is not that the teacher ignored it. The amazing thing is that the teach actually got in trouble for it!</p>

		<p>Teachers regardless of race, are becoming a major danger to our chlidren. they need to start doing more through background checks and/or psychological evaluations on teachgers before they hire them to teach our kids!</p>
<p><br>
I couldn&rsquo;t agree more!</p>

		<p>To Anonymous #16:  My hometown in rural eastern PA had a similar problem when I was in junior high (1970&rsquo;s).  A large proportion of teachers were culturally Southern Italian and, following their tradition, thought nothing of fondling the girls at the start of class.  There were few if any complaints because (1) many of the students and parents were themselves Southern Italian, and &#8220;understood&#8221; this behavior; and (2) the school board was purportedly under mob control.  (To this day, it is difficult to get a teaching position in H. town unless you are Italian, and local, and &#8220;connected&#8221;.)  </p>
<p>(Note to those who comment on Hispanic sexual harassment behaviors:  please consider how much this may be a Mediterranean thing rather than an Aztec thing or poverty/illiteracy thing.  The whole Mediterranean area was considered risky for women a few decades ago and men thought nothing of pinching or kissing strange women.  On my high-school trip to Spain, I had gone out with a bunch of girls for tapas in Madrid and we were soon approached by some male twentysomethings who put their arms around us and pleaded &#8220;Besame por favor&#8221;.  The former Yugoslavia was a similar hotspot:  groups of Serbian males were to be avoided by foreign women at all costs.  Italy doesn&rsquo;t even need to be mentioned.  Feel free to consider whether it&rsquo;s genes or memes.)</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
Cambridge, MA in the 1990&rsquo;s:  some black kids got caught doing various oral activities in a stairwell of their middle school.  The authorities hesitated in taking action, out of politically-correct fears that such behavior might be part of the kids&rsquo; &#8220;culture&#8221;. <br>

		<p>Wish background checks were required of students AND their parents, so many of whom are psychotic and dangerous these days, before they are unleashed upon the schools.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p><br>
Don&rsquo;t blame the parents. You are making excuses for teachers. It is the teachers who are afult here!</p>

		<p>Just yesterday my wife told me of a similar incident that happened in the elementary school we are districted for.  I could hardly believe it but she heard it from a police officer&rsquo;s wife whose husband handled the call.  It appears to have been hushed up rather quickly, never showing up in the crime logs of the local newspaper.  This elementary school was a model for our state at one time then, the local socialists decided to invite half the ghetto to go there.  We wouldn&rsquo;t expose our children to such trash and now pay a large part of our income for the children to attend a religious school.</p>
