			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, January 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A government agency on the front lines of the immigration debate has begun installing lifesaving buoys in a fast-moving canal along the U.S.-Mexico border where migrants drown each year as they sneak into the country illegally.</p>
<p>The debate over the lifelines has long presented authorities with a moral dilemma: Is it acceptable to do nothing when so many immigrants are dying in the water? Or do lifesaving devices lull immigrants into a false sense of security that they can conquer the channel while giving them extra motivation to enter the country illegally?</p>
<p>The agency that manages the canal had waffled on those questions as board members worried aloud that the buoys would encourage illegal immigration. But the Imperial Irrigation District reversed course in August and has been bolting 105 lines across the 82-mile desert canal at a cost of $1.1 million. Crews are also planting 1,414 bilingual signs on canal banks that read, &#8220;Warning: Dangerous Water.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The canal can pose extreme danger to people trying to swim across. Currents moving at 25 mph to 30 mph can be no match for immigrants who can&rsquo;t swim. The decomposing corpses of immigrants rise to the surface bloated with gases after days underwater expanding like balloons.</p>
<p>More than 500 people have drowned in the All-American Canal since the waterway was built in 1942 to bring Colorado River water to farms in California&rsquo;s Imperial Valley. Twelve people died in 2009. The death toll peaked at 31 in 1998 after a Border Patrol crackdown in San Diego pushed migrants to cross in remote areas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Migrants interviewed at a shelter across the border in Mexicali, Mexico, said the buoy lines will have little impact on whether people cross the canal.</p>
<p>Juan Avalos swam across the canal in 2001 and 2004 and planned to do it again sometime this month with a few friends. They will use a ladder or rope to climb over a nearby border fence before plunging into the canal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who knows how to swim really well is going to be fine,&#8221; said Avalos, 40. &#8220;Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t swim that well may have problems. It&rsquo;s easy for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The configuration of the buoys was controversial.</p>
<p>Some wanted the lines placed at 45-degree angles and pointed downstream toward Mexico. That way, anyone who grabbed a line would be pushed by the currents away from the U.S. and back to Mexico.</p>
<p>The angled buoy plan was eventually scrapped in a victory for John Hunter, a suburban San Diego physicist who has been the leading advocate for the buoys.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The irrigation district made the decision to install the buoys after board member Stella Mendoza faced withering criticism following the &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; report. She was quoted as saying more people were likely to die without changes in a canal that some have dubbed &#8220;the most dangerous body of water in the U.S.&#8221;</p>

		<p>They just don&rsquo;t get it, do they.  The Nation is bankrupt, and their fiscal irresponsibility threatens to destroy America.  Yet they see nothing wrong with wasting yet another $1.1 million to maintain the invasion. </p>
<p>Why should they care?   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s not their money, it&rsquo;s yours.  They are willing to spend as much of your money as needed to fulfill their Utopian schemes. </p>

		<p>This canal is not exactly &#8220;on&#8221; the border. Is some miles inland.</p>
<p>And it is not so much the water speed, which is pretty high to begin with that is the danger. The water is ICY COLD and the shock from the plunge into the water is quite often too much for most folks. A whole family trying to cross can be all killed in the proverbial heartbeat.</p>
<p>And I am glad the buoy and line is slanted so the folks are headed back toward Mexico. Send them a message all right. OH, some folks are just so smart when they plan this stuff.</p>
<p>Please too, NOT just signs in Spanish. That might be discriminatory. Have them in a dozen or so languages or even twice that. </p>

		<p>Twelve people died in 2009. That is almost the DAILY total of American citizens killed by illegal aliens in this country. </p>
<p>About a half dozen to a dozen American citizens are killed daily by illegal aliens. Almost all by illegals driving drunk. And almost all of those Mexican. It is not an crime to drive drunk in Mex.</p>
<p>That figure of a half dozen to a dozen is based on the stat that about 15 % of all crime and crimanals in the U.S. is done by illegals.</p>
<p>Mr. Smart Guy Physicist, put your concerns where they are needed.</p>

		<p>I am surprised that any federal agency would exercise the fiscal restraint that is revealed in this article. This is not what I have come to expect from our government. Did they not even consider how much safer a billion dollar bridge would be? A rest area in the middle like the tollway oases up around Chicago would have been a nice touch, also. </p>
<p>It is probably the stress of crossing that canal that drives illegals to join gangs and drive while drunk.  </p>

		<p>So non-Whites are willing to risk drowning to death to live in the countries where the most of us evil Whites are?  How odd.  I would have figured if you think a group of people is racist, you would not want to live around them.  That must be my &#8220;racist hick&#8221; logic working.  I need to become an &#8220;enlightened leftist&#8221; and begin to understand things more clearly!</p>

<p>I must disagree! It&rsquo;s not like the Battle of the Atlantic.  These border jumpers got themselves in the water   &mdash;   nobody put them there. So let them get themselves out.</p>
<p>And when you &#8220;lock em up&#8221; you assume responsibility for them. From them on, it&rsquo;s not just food and care: it&rsquo;s lawsuits, legal appeals, free lawyers, translators, asylum claims, whatever tricks  they (and their leftist enablers) can think of.  All the while at OUR endless expense! </p>
<p>This excessive, maudlin sympathy for everyone else&rsquo;s well being but our own is largely what has gotten us into this present mess.  We are not responsible for everyone in the world   &mdash;   especially those who are invading us!  We must return to looking out for our own interests. Let THEM look out for theirs! <br>
 <br>
Let me just ask if Mexico would have the same  concern for illegal aliens invading Mexico?  Silly question.</p>
<p>No, I say DON&rsquo;T lock em up. Don&rsquo;t even get involved with them at all. Leave them to their own devices and what they got themselves into. It&rsquo;s not our responsibility to rescue them from themselves.</p>

		<p>Why not pass a Unfunded Immigration Bill ?</p>
<p>We could cut off the Billions given each year to Non Profits and Churches they often work against the USA. </p>
<p>Would it not be cheaper than giving $393 Million in Federal Grants to Pat Robinson for his 700 Club, or $193 Million in Federal Grants to Rev. Graham for the Samaritan Trust he even pays his self over $ 570,000 a year and donates $1 Million to Political Campaigns. That just $ 600 Million in Federal Grants. </p>
<p>At least here in the USA we can control the food they are given from U.S. Farmers paid for by Tax Payers and it will not be stolen by corrupt governments. We can even Jail the bad ones and the Corporate Jailers can make Billions on Federal Contracts to jail them.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Am I not obligated to protect my family nation or tribe first?&rsquo; Was hoping you could enlighten me how a guy about to drown is an immediate threat to your family?!? If he had a weapon he most likely dropped it trying to keep his head above water. If your on shore and he ain`t you should have the upper hand and have plenty of time to secure his compliance while he gets on land&hellip;</p>

<p>I doubt Mexicans would honor that if we were invading their country.  If you get injured or sick in Mexico, you have to pay up front for emergency medical treatment.  A number of American citizens have died because they didn&rsquo;t have enough cash on them to pay for emergency services.  </p>
<p>White people need to get over universal morality.  It&rsquo;s the fatal flaw in our culture that allows all these outrages to happen.</p>

		<p>This is nonsense. Only in America can you aid someone who is entering your country illegally. This is on par with the decision to place water coolers in the desert to prevent illegals from dying of thirst and dehydration. Only in America can someone enter into this country illegally, die of de-hydration and then have their estate sue America for not preventing it. Incredible!!!</p>
