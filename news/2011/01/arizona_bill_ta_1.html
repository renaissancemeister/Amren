<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona lawmakers are again diving into the national debate over illegal immigration, proposing a bill that challenges automatic U.S. citizenship for children of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republican State Rep. John Kavanagh, who filed the latest proposal, said the goal isn&rsquo;t to get every state to enact such a law but to bring the dispute to court in hopes of reducing the costs associated with granting automatic citizenship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is the second time this year that lawmakers in a state have targeted the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. A similar proposal was filed last week in the Indiana General Assembly.</p>
<p>Supporters argue that the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to people born in the U.S. who are &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction&#8221; of this country, doesn&rsquo;t apply to the children of illegal immigrants because such families don&rsquo;t owe sole allegiance to the U.S.</p>
<p>Opponents say the proposal is mean-spirited, won&rsquo;t make a dent in the state&rsquo;s immigration woes and will be declared unconstitutional by the courts.</p>

		<p>Ask these people if they care about the poor white taxpayer..<br>
dragging himself to work day after day to pay..working from<br>
January to June just to pay the bills for his own racial<br>
dispossesion? Ask them how much they think of that man. Ask them<br>
about their caring attitude when they control the press,<br>
block the Constitution, attack free speech, ram propaganda <br>
through the classrooms, exploit the ignorant, strip men of<br>
their jobs, rewrite American history, riddle the voter registration process with fraud, destroy the work of 12 generations of white Americans..ask them if their love and sympathy extend to THAT.</p>

		<p>Does anyone really believe, among the leftists, that when the 14th amendment was approved, that its intention was to include illegal immigrants? I mean, really?</p>

		<p>Mean-spirited? How about one of the ways of saving our country? Mexican law says no matter where in the world a child of Mexicans is born, they are Mexican citizens. That should take care of that. We don&rsquo;t need dual citizenship for the invaders. We know where their loyalties would lie. Now, let&rsquo;s get on with making E-verify mandatory for all businesses, stopping all benefits - including education and medication to illegals and we&rsquo;ll start to see an exodus south.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is mean spirited.<br>
What about young American citizens like me? What about my future white children? Who will protect them? Do they not deserve a secure protected nation?<br>
What I find most hilarious is that they continuously abuse their populace, yet expect us to support them in every possible fashion as &ldquo;loyal Americans citizens&rdquo; (funny how that is suddenly significant when it is most convenient yet at other times is a thing &ldquo;of the past&rdquo;).<br>
I believe the founding fathers would be horrified by this wave of Mestizos into our nation. Invading and destroying everything in their path while whites flee farther from what were once American neighborhoods.</p>
<p>If anyone born here can become a citizen, and their family stay, then is there any hope left for the natives?<br>

		<p>Validity of the 14th Amendment aside, the authors of it made it clear that it was not meant to grant citizenship to anchor babies.</p>

		<p>Mean-spirited is making me pay for others&rsquo; kids and lifestyles.  Mean-spirited is making me and others like me pay for my own destruction.  Mean-spirited is telling whites they are evil and made to feel bad for being pro-white and wanting to have ore white babies.  Mean-spirited is putting different groups of people together and expecting them to get along.</p>
