			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), January 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Afshan Azad, 21, who played Padma Patil, a classmate of the teenage wizard, in the blockbuster Hollywood films based on JK Rowling&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s books, feared for her life during the three-hour ordeal, Manchester Crown Court heard.</p>
<p>She was punched, dragged around by her hair and strangled by her brother Ashraf Azad, 28, who threatened to kill her after he caught her talking on the phone to her Hindu boyfriend on May 21 last year, the court was told.</p>
<p>During the row at the family home in Longsight, Manchester, which also involved her mother and father, she was branded a &#8220;slag&#8221; and a &#8220;prostitute&#8221; and told: &#8220;Marry a Muslim or you die!&#8221;</p>
<p>The actress, who now lives in London, had pleaded for leniency from the court, begging the judge not to jail her older brother.</p>
<p>But Judge Roger Thomas QC sent him to prison for six months after he pleaded guilty to the assault.</p>
<p>&#8220;This persistent attack was accompanied by serious and very hurtful abuse and threats,&#8221; he told the defendant.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been a miserable and frightening experience for your sister which, she suggested, lasted for about three hours or so.</p>
<p>&#8220;The background to this offence lies in the concern that you, and perhaps other family members, had about Afshan&rsquo;s relationship with a young man who was not of the Islamic faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Thomas added: &#8220;This is a sentence that is designed to punish you for what you did and also to send out a clear message to others that domestic violence involving circumstances such as have arisen here cannot be tolerated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier, the court heard that the actress&rsquo;s family are devout Muslims but she had begun a &#8220;romantic relationship&#8221; with a Hindu man.</p>
<p>Richard Vardon QC, prosecuting, said: &#8220;Apparently that was a cause of some concern as far as Afshan was concerned. She realised her family would never accept the relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>At about 7pm on May 21 last year, she was in her bedroom at the family home, talking on her mobile  &mdash;  and was overheard by her brother in the bathroom, who assumed it was her Hindu boyfriend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hear you from here,&#8221; he shouted, before adding: &#8220;Who the   &mdash;    &mdash;   do you think you are talking to? Watch what I will do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Vardon said Miss Azad ended the call, hid the phone and sim card and then sat on her bed before the defendant barged in and began shouting at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;He then grabbed her hair and threw her across the room,&#8221; the prosecutor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He pulled her by the hair and threw her on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;She began crying and asked him to stop. The defendant began punching her with clenched fists to her back and head area.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the actress cowered in a ball on the floor, her brother&rsquo;s wife, Sonia, who also lived at the address, came into the room and tried to push him away.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told her to stay out of it,&#8221; Mr Vardon continued, &#8220;because he would do what he wanted with his little sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;He grabbed her by the hair and pulled her up from the floor, dragging her downstairs to her father&rsquo;s bedroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was pushed on to her father&rsquo;s bed, with her brother shouting: &#8220;Sort your daughter out! She&rsquo;s a slag!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her father may then have said: &#8220;Just kill her!&#8221;  &mdash;  although this was disputed in court because of his Punjabi accent.</p>
<p>The defendant then grabbed her by the neck and began to throttle her, the court heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;She struggled to breathe and was scared for her life,&#8221; Mr Vardon added.</p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s mother and sister-in-law then entered the bedroom as the family discussed what to do with her, the court was told.</p>
<p>Her father, Abul, 53, suggested sending her back to Bangladesh for an arranged marriage.</p>
<p>Her mother called her a &#8220;prostitute&#8221; and asked her how many men she had been with, adding: &#8220;Why are you obsessed with sex?&#8221;</p>
<p>The defendant then said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to kill you. I&rsquo;m actually going to kill you&#8221;, and left the room, with the door locked behind him by one of the women.</p>
<p>He was then heard &#8220;rattling through kitchen drawers&#8221; before shouting: &#8220;Where are the knives?&#8221;  &mdash;  thought to have been hidden by his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was told she had to marry a Muslim or you die,&#8221; Mr Vardon added, and her parents began asking who she wanted to marry and making a list.</p>
<p>The defendant then said he had found in her bedroom a passport photo of the Hindu boyfriend and went to look for him.</p>
<p>By 10pm calm was restored and Miss Azad&rsquo;s father sent her to bed, but she fled the family home the next day through her bedroom window.</p>
<p>&#8220;She realised she would have to leave and felt she could not live any longer in that environment,&#8221; Mr Vardon said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was genuinely fearing for her life.&#8221;<br>

<p>Somewhere in the US a liberal judge is salivating in hopes of having a similar case in his/her court.<br>
Eager awaiting to show how enlightened they are by ruling in favor of Islam and their interpretation of &#8220;Freedom of Religion&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Now that he has been arrested and more shame has been brought to the family I imagine her father, mother and brother will all collude to murder this girl when the time comes, as it is the only way to restore &#8220;honor&#8221; to the family.  The leftist elites and their love for all things non-white are solely to blame for situations like this.  </p>

		<p>No sympathy for the people of this so-called religion. The victim of the assault, the sister, asked for leniency for her brother, the perpetrator. Absolute lack of self-esteem on her part. Which is exactly how Muslims raise females in their &#8220;religion&#8221;. That women aren&rsquo;t worth anything. And they comply, even though living in a FREE country where they can GET AWAY.</p>
<p>Typical of the family drama that plays out in third world countries, now in all white European countries, thanks to the liberal worship of DIVERSITY.</p>
<p>Still we&rsquo;re expected to think of Muslims as a peace loving people. And this is how they treat their own. Do you really think, America, they would treat you any better?  </p>

<p>Yes, someplace where dragging women around by their hair is o.k.<br>
And choking?  Well, that&rsquo;s only allowed if there&rsquo;s a good reason for it, like wearing lipstick or talking to a man that isn&rsquo;t a relative.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful to be enriched by all this diversity?</p>

		<p>I know of christian parents who abuse their daughters because they want to be with non-christian men.  In the middle east also the arab christians do honor killings too.  </p>

		<p>Well, this is the first I&rsquo;m hearing of it.  Of course, had the family been Christians of any kind, it would have been headline news, &amp; all over the media 24/7.  Christians behaving this way would be actual scandal &amp; therefore news.  As for Muslims&hellip; well&hellip;  What&rsquo;s that term they used to use&hellip;. &#8220;the soft bigotry of low expectations.&#8221;  Christians are held to a higher standard of behavior, even (or especially) by those who despise them.</p>

		<p>It won&rsquo;t last.  As the courts become less and less white and names like &#8216;Roger Thomas&rsquo; and &#8216;Richard Vardon&rsquo; fade away, there will be less law as it&rsquo;s own measure and more &#8216;wax my mustache&rsquo; bribery to see an ethnic culural perspective in all things.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, it&rsquo;s not unique to SWA, Africa or Mexico, though certainly more primitive, machismo driven, cultures tend to value the more fragile elements of female psychology less than their status as chattel.</p>
<p>Hitler for example, exercised similar abusive dominance over his younger siblings and likely murdered his niece for refusing him in an attempt to move to another city and another boyfriend.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised if this kind of &#8216;dominant patriarchy&rsquo; was not at least partly responsible for the former submission of white women to marrying white and in-class with their own.  Even highly intelligent Jews and Parsi have a noted preference for seeing their daughters marry within the endo-group.</p>
<p>Yet, like it or not, the seeming evolutionary role of women as accomodators is to invite new genes into existing bloodlines where outright rape is forbidden and their status as property forbids them from leaving.</p>
<p>In this, their social denigration and subjugation makes them throw out bonds of co-victimization sympathy to others in like circumstances (i.e. social underdogs who can&rsquo;t cut it as outsiders with ethnic or caste limited social mobility).</p>
<p>They then &#8216;intuitively&rsquo; confuse sympathy with similarity of position and epigenetic imprinting takes care of the rest, readying a woman&rsquo;s sexual psychology for mating with her chosen but not necessarily ideal partner.</p>
<p>And we wonder why mixed ethnic partnerships have about 50% higher rates of _non compatible_ spousal abuse and general domestic violence?  Non-linear reasoning is poor rationale for abusive outcomes.</p>
<p>Especially when our culture IS our genes.</p>
<p>The sooner we get past feeling guilty about admitting that as a function of appreciating what we have made of ourselves that no other group has achieved, the sooner we can start to conserve whatever is left of our once proud people.</p>
<p>Hopefully today&rsquo;s &#8216;smart&rsquo; women will be able to be convinced of this without pulling the feminism card.  If not, we may be in the same position this brother was: excoriation and exile or acceptance and submission is a hard control psychology choice to live with as much as give up.</p>

		<p>Last night I was reading some book reviews i the British Geographic Magazine. One book that stood out was &#8220;Britains First Muslims&#8221;. I will now quote from the review verbatim:</p>
<p>&#8220;The next few decades of British political and cultural life will be enriched by the aspirations, grumbles and talents of British Muslims&#8221;</p>
<p>The reviewer then goes on to say how he is looking forward to this. Has this reviewer had his eyes shut since 9/11 and perhaps he did not notice the Glasgow Airport bomb or the Shoe Bomber or Muslim Gang rape in the UK, or Pakistani arranged marriages(also in the UK) and so on.</p>
<p>Re Anon #1. The Islamic inerpretation of freedom of religion is; Yes, anyone is free to become a Muslim in our country! (This was from an article written by a missionary who used to do medical work in the ME)</p>

<p>No doubt! I am sure they will have learned nothing. They will be looking for revenge.</p>
<p>Making this more absurd is that she pled on her brother&rsquo;s behalf! Even after he tried to murder her, she has learned nothing. She deserves whatever she gets.</p>
<p>Are these the kind of people we want to be importing?  Are these people making any useful contribution to our society? Do we want these people among us?  They should never have been allowed in in the first place.</p>

		<p>and the punchline is ? <br>
-this simply is Islam. It&rsquo;s a religion of incarceration and violence, not freedom.<br>
Of course, if you&rsquo;re a man, you have more freedoms, to rape freely, among others.<br>
Nieve women buy into the love and peace side of Islam, blindly. They are usually haters of all things white and American. Then one day, when they accidentally cross an invisible line, this is the outcome- a severe beating.<br>
This is now IN America; only a matter of time until Sharia Law is in America too, then it will spread like wildfire and our US way of life will go further down the toilet.<br>
Personally, I&rsquo;m reay to leave the US. The politically correct left wing nuts have made the US a third world dump.<br>

<p>Oh, please!  How pervasive is that in this day and age?  Spare us the anecdotes.  Post a link to a study showing that Christian girls/women are suffering anywhere near the level of abuse they are enduring in Islamic societies.  Fringe groups (like the polygamous Mormons) notwithstanding.  I&rsquo;m an agnostic, by the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the middle east also the arab christians do honor killings too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again: how often does that happen (relative to &#8216;honor killings&rsquo; by Moslems)?  This online periodical puts it in persepctive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.meforum.org/2067/are-honor-killings-simply-domestic-violence#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">http://www.meforum.org/2067/are-honor-killings-simply-domestic-violence#_ftn2</a></p>
<p>Honor killings: Committed mainly by Muslims against Muslim girls/young adult women.</p>
<p><br>
As I stated earlier, I&rsquo;m an agnostic.  In this day and age of Archaeology, Biology and Geology, I think anyone who believes in religion is silly.  That being said, it should be obvious to all except the militantly anti-Christian that females have much more to fear from Islam than Christianity.</p>

		<p>How many more incidents of this kind is it going to take for this country to truly understand that Islam is a &#8220;religion&#8221; that forces its adherents to commit acts of violence, and is therefore a danger to the very existence of the United States?  All Islamic members/devotees need to be deported ASAP, and if we don&rsquo;t do that, we are going to live to regret it more deeply than we can even imagine now.  Face it, friends, the enemy IS Islam - it isn&rsquo;t a religion, it&rsquo;s a political system masquerading as a religion, and its goal is political power, pure and simple.  It has no place in this country.</p>
