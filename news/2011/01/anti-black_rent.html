<h1>Anti-Black Rental Bias Costs Orland Park Landowner $35,000</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Feldheim, OrlandoParkPatch, January 19, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two lawsuits were filed against Terence Flanagan in 2009, both stemming from accusations that he refused to rent an Orland Park house to a black man named Kemal Majied. Majied and the South Suburban Housing Center, a Homewood-based non-profit that works to uphold fair housing practices, filed one suit. The U.S government filed a second suit, and both claimed Flanagan had violated the Fair Housing Act.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Flanagan admitted to comments he made to two white women, one sent from the SSHC and the other from the U.S. Department of Justice, that he prefers to not rent to black people, according to court documents reviewed by Patch. Flanagan also admits to declining to rent the house to Majied, originally saying the house was taken, even though over the phone he later told Majied&rsquo;s wife, who is white, that it was still available.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The couple contacted the SSHC the next day, and a white female staff member from the center later met with Flanagan about the house. The staff member reported that during the meeting Flanagan said he had no intention of renting to black people. He also asked if her husband was black and said he had problems when he &#8220;unknowingly rented the house previously to an interracial couple,&#8221; according to the documents. It was also recorded in the documents that Flanagan said he turned down renting to a black man who offered to pay the first full year of rent up front.</p>
<p>About a week after the Majieds first spoke with Flanagan, a white female DOJ staff member met him at the house about renting. Flanagan also asked this woman if her husband was black, again stated his preference to not rent to black people and said that he turned down a black man who offered a full year&rsquo;s rent, according to the documents. He also offered to rent the house to her at lower than the advertised price because she wasn&rsquo;t black, the documents read.</p>
<p>&#8220;This case involved some of the most dramatic evidence of discrimination we have seen,&#8221; said John Petruszak, executive director of the South Suburban Housing Center. &#8220;Discriminating landowners tend to be more subtle. It was an eye opener for us even after doing these investigations as long as we have.&#8221;</p>
<p>The settlement terms include $15,000 to be paid to the Majieds and the SSHC each. A $5,000 civil penalty is to be paid to the federal government. Flanagan also will only be able to rent property he owns through a third party who is approved by the government for the next five years. He cannot make any rental deals himself during that time.</p>

		<p>When something like a rooming house is integrated, in the interest of a better world, who is going to pay for the mental and physical damage to person and property of the white tenants in the house? I&rsquo;m guessing not the group that made this ruling. I bet they wont even take note or if they do it will be to lament the evil of whites and white-flight. </p>

		<p>Why do we need that?<br>
Why do we need need agents like in the communist East Germany to find out who is &#8220;unfair&#8221;?<br>
Why do we need that all if diversity works so great and is such a great thing?</p>
<p>The topic is clear: Whites do not want blacks or want to live next to them. But to break every defense, they send their agents to make fear and panic. If a company takes black, it will go bankrupt because the Chinese and Japanese can hire whoever they want. If the company don&rsquo;t have blacks, the lawsuits will come.<br>
However, it will be better for companies just to go to mono-ethnic areas even when the salaries are higher there.</p>

		<p>The nerve of this white man is not to be believed.<br>
Imagine just because he had to save a downpayment for the property, maintains it at his own expense and pays taxes on it he has the audacity to think he can choose who will live there (the nerve of this guy) I have many rental properties and the one thing that sends a chill up my spine is seeing blacks come to check out renting it. The are hard to collect from, know all the scams to avoid paying rent, abuse property, cause problems for neighbors and do not follow the rules but if you point this out that RACIST card appears. It is not because you are black that we don&rsquo;t want you&hellip;. It&rsquo;s because of your attitudes and behaviours.</p>

		<p>Mr.Flanagan was the one that signed his name on the bank loan and he is the one that is taking all the risk. He puts his money and time in his property every month with up keep and taxes. He is responsible to the bank and to the county to keep up the place or he will be find. Why should Mr. Flanagan lose his RIGHTS to rent to whomever he thinks will take the better care of his property.</p>

<p>While I agree that a property owner has the right to do as he wants, if you manage rental properties and you aren&rsquo;t aware of what you can and can&rsquo;t say and do, you might as well have STUPID branded on your forehead.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s because it probably sounded highly suspicious to this guy. How many blacks offer to pay a whole years rent up front? I would argue he wasn&rsquo;t refusing to rent to a black, but rather didn&rsquo;t want a drug dealer living on his property.</p>

		<p>My own taxes, and Mr Flanagan&rsquo;s, are used to set him up and persecute him. Government employees get a regular check for scouting out and bankrupting ordinary American citizens. He could have been more cautious, I suppose, in how he went about trying to rent the place considering the current situation. However, bottom line, it is his place and he has to consider what&rsquo;s best for him and the other tenants. Blacks are notorious for being undesirable tenants and neighbors, everybody is aware of that. Plus, if he&rsquo;s born here where did this Kemal person get that name? Is he a muslim convert? Lots of black males convert in prison, so that&rsquo;s always a red flag when one runs across it.  </p>

		<p>The best thing to do with rentals is to put out the word among the neighbors when a house or unit becomes available.  After all, these are the people who will have to live next door to whoever the property is rented to.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been doing this for over 20 years with our rentals and it&rsquo;s worked like a charm for us.  One word to neighbors quickly produces a suitable relative or acquaintance.</p>

		<p>He could have gotten away without renting the house to a Black person if he had shut his mouth and said nothing about not wanting to rent to Blacks or interracial couples. He could have shown the house to Blacks and when someone inquired about wanting to rent the house or offer to pay a year&rsquo;s rent up front, he could have said that he has appointments to show the house would not make a decision until after the appotintments are over. </p>

		<p>Better believe I added my two-cents&rsquo; worth.  One of the planks of Communism is abolition of private property (or something to that effect), and we&rsquo;re seeing that here.  You can&rsquo;t do what you want with your property anymore.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been living in the same apartment for 10 years (we like our landlord and the rent is a decent rate  &mdash;  and in a decent neighborhood), we&rsquo;ve seen tenants come and go&hellip;and while we had one decent black neighbor across the hall at one point, any other time we&rsquo;ve had a black tenant, or a &#8220;wigger&#8221; who had a bunch of black friends, there was trouble.  I had a discussion with our landlord, who basically said that they were between a rock and a hard place in one instance  &mdash;  rent to this one or they were racist.  I understood.</p>
<p>The latest black tenant, a couple of years ago, skipped out on rent and left a bunch of stuff behind.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster #7 - you have to avoid being stupid in these situations. The deck is stacked against whites and we are in a holding/defensive situation.</p>
<p>It seems the reaction was severe in this poor guy&rsquo;s case because he was so right. The more truthful one is about the reality of race the greater the backlash. It&rsquo;s as if people are so enraged about having to face the honest facts that they over-react, as if that will make the truth go away.</p>
<p>These are skirmishes in a long, undeclared war. Until more direct action is possible it is necessary that whites use the intelligence at our disposal to accomplish what Mr. Flanagan intended in ways that communist-groups like the SSHC cannot get around, fight, or even discover.</p>
<p>Whites also need to use the law (or what&rsquo;s left of it) to our advantage. Blacks are not known for their attention to detail and groups like the SSHC are dependent on outside funding. Their clientele - so to speak - are certainly not contributing anything substantial.</p>
<p>And it seems there are many legal and/or technical ways to get around renting to anyone. </p>
<p>So, it is brainpower and skill to promote white culture and segregation AND if possible, money to bleed our opponents in the legal arena. Whites need to step forward.</p>
<p>Lastly, as in this case, it seems odd that the person suing often knows he or she is not wanted and perhaps scorned. So why would they demand to live in such an environment? <br>

<p>That pretty much covers all bases Merle. This phony business of not liking blacks because of skin color is mostly bunk. At one time, freedom of association/assembly was one of the sacred rights of our Constitution. The right to do as we see fit with personal &#8220;property&#8221; was another right guaranteed by our Bill of Rights. Today our legislating Judiciary has abrogated our formerly Constitutional rights, and &ldquo;our&rdquo; government routinely interferes in private business. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never been involved in renting out property but to me the risk analysis seems to be weighing the remote chance of a fine for housing discrimination versus the all but certain financial losses when renting to blacks: unpaid rent, property destruction, wasteful consumption on utilities, legal expenses for evictions, possible fines from law enforcement calls, etc. </p>

BINGO, that was my first thought also. Don&rsquo;t say those things to Whites you don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way - many times -  that there&rsquo;s ALOT of Whites that will break their neck to go tell blacks about some &#8220;racisss&#8221; statement you made, making them feel &#8220;progessive&#8221; in the process. Blacks aren&rsquo;t like that, they&rsquo;re VERY guarded about what they leak out to Whitey about other black folks. </p>

		<p>Yes, you have to be careful about race when renting. I don&rsquo;t rent to blacks. Easy to screen them by having &#8220;potential renters&#8221; call and leave a detailed message etc. You can tell what they are and race. Easy to screen them out without meeting applicants in person. </p>
<p>PS: Had success with asians - they&rsquo;re pretty good, even some hispanics  &mdash;  but no blacks.<br>
