<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MORE than 140,000 skilled migrants are caught in an Immigration Department processing backlog of up to 28 months. </p>
<p>Business leaders are warning of a looming skills shortage and a wages breakout driven by a resurgent economy.</p>
<p>In a secret briefing to Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, the department warned of potential legal action by skilled migrants unable to get a decision on their applications. The department also said that, in order to offset the ageing of the workforce, migration would need to remain at levels that would lead to Australia having a population of 35.9 million by 2050  &mdash;  the figure that sparked the &#8220;big Australia&#8221; debate and Julia Gillard&rsquo;s promise of a sustainable Australia.</p>
<p>Despite cuts to migration levels that would cause net overseas migration to plateau at about 190,000 a year by 2012, the Red Book briefing said net overseas migration would still be above the 180,000-a-year level used by Treasury in the 2010 Inter-Generational Report, when it calculated the figure of 35.9 million by 2050.</p>
<p>The release of the briefing came as Reserve Bank director Graham Kraehe called for an increase to skilled immigration to avoid a broader wages breakout.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think skills shortages are a major problem and if we don&rsquo;t increase the amount of skilled migration then we are going to have some real pressure on wages,&#8221; said Mr Kraehe, who is also chairman of BlueScope Steel and Brambles.</p>
<p>The departmental brief, obtained under Freedom of Information laws and compiled in September, also predicted further riots from the detained Indonesian crews of asylum-seeker boats and warned that immigration detention facilities were stretched beyond capacity, with 2646 people held for more than 120 days.</p>
<p>The briefing painted a picture of a department under &#8220;stress&#8221; from an influx of &#8220;irregular maritime arrivals&#8221; and a migration program facing a situation where &#8220;there are far more people seeking to migrate to Australia than the country wishes to absorb&#8221;.</p>
<p>The briefing said the influx of asylum-seekers had meant an extra 400 qualified staff would be required to handle the workload.</p>
<p>The department warned it urgently needed extra funding to house the asylum-seekers, after being overwhelmed by approximately 700 arrivals by boat a month last financial year, more than four times its budgeted estimate of 166 a month, and the average processing time from arrival to granting a visa stood at 147 days.</p>
<p>In a remark that places the government on a potential collision course with the Greens, the briefing foreshadowed the possible need for legislation to advance the East Timor processing centre, a measure flatly opposed by the minor party&rsquo;s leader, Bob Brown.</p>
<p>The Red Book also revealed that the government:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Screened 369 citizenship and visa applicants suspected of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide during 2009-10.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Developed a contingency plan for an emergency evacuation of Australians from New Delhi in the event of a major incident at the Commonwealth Games and contemplated also bringing out South Pacific Island VIPs and athletes.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Is examining using &#8220;advanced analytic software&#8221;, including data mining, pattern recognition and network analysis techniques to detect possible threats and fraud.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Faces a backlash from tens of thousands of overseas students caught by the government&rsquo;s reforms to international education visa programs who were facing a blowout in the overseas student queue for permanent visas and likely rejection, despite grandfathering provisions aimed at smoothing the adjustment.</p>
<p>In addition to the processing backlog of 140,000 applications in the general skilled migration category, there were 29,000 people seeking processing for partner places under the family reunion program.</p>
<p>The department warned the backlogs could spark legal action from disaffected people awaiting processing as, under the Migration Act, a person who lodged a valid application was entitled to a decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;The use of priority processing directions in recent years, so as to selectively target applications for skilled migration, in combination with high applicant numbers, has meant that some people are persistently at the bottom of the queue with their application unprocessed,&#8221; the brief said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible that legal action may be launched by disaffected people in this group.&#8221;</p>
<p>In calling for an increase in skilled migration, Mr Kraehe said shortages were already emerging.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are already seeing that up in the northwest and that will just get worse,&#8221; Mr Kraehe told The Australian last night. &#8220;That will exacerbate the two-speed economy that we are facing and the issues related to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two things are critical: one is some measures to improve productivity, which has been very poor in the last three or four years and declining; and the second is to increase the skilled immigration quotas so we can address what is already a shortage and something that is putting pressure on project costs and more broadly will put pressure on wages costs in the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wesfarmers chief executive Richard Goyder - who oversees one of the country&rsquo;s biggest employers spanning Coles supermarkets and Bunnings hardware stores - said he was keeping a &#8220;very close eye&#8221; on skills shortages.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s something we are very aware of, particularly in engineering, both skilled and semi-skilled areas. In the industrial businesses we&rsquo;ve got particularly, it&rsquo;s something we are acutely aware of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Australian Industry Group chief executive Heather Ridout said skills shortages would only grow in the months and years ahead and were contributing to wages inflation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are at the early stage of a very, very big investment boom in Australia and that would suggest these are going to get worse,&#8221; Ms Ridout said. &#8220;How these skilled migration systems and processes work is going to be really important over the next few years. They are certainly biting now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Peter Anderson demanded a more flexible skilled migration program. &#8220;If the government puts hard and fast rules in place that create gaps in our labour market then we will suffer productivity losses,&#8221; Mr Anderson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a nation, we start this year with an already sluggish productivity rate and gaps in our labour market will exacerbate our productivity problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Business Council of Australia deputy chief executive Maria Tarrant said it was crucial that the government &#8220;streamline and deal with some of the causes of the backlog&#8221;. &#8220;If you are thinking about how in the long term you deal with an ageing population, growing economy and skills gaps, skilled migration has to be part of the kit bag going forward.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The socialists are at work again.  We have thousands of asylum seekers from the 3rd world, intent on living off our welfare system, arriving every year.  They are treated as royalty, to top accommodation &amp; cash handouts our pensioners can only dream of.<br>
[did I mention our pensioners actually have contributed to the welfare system all of their working lives].</p>

Business leaders are warning of a looming skills shortage and a wages breakout driven by a resurgent economy.<br>

<p>&gt;<br>
&ldquo;I think skills shortages are a major problem and if we don&rsquo;t increase the amount of skilled migration then we are going to have some real pressure on wages,&rdquo; said Mr Kraehe, who is also chairman of BlueScope Steel and Brambles.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Since a simple understanding of the laws of supply and demand prove that a surplus of &#8216;skilled&rsquo; labor allows wages to be -reduced- while a scarcity of same forces employers to compete with offers of HIGHER wages to give to a more limited pool of potential employees.</p>
<p>What these idiots take 20 paragraphs to sell the Big Lie on is what we in the States have already suffered through with Hispanic Illegals as corporate profiteerists look at the unwashed hordes of immigrants and see cheap consumerism bloom their annual margins, enabled by transfer payments from the public tax base that they don&rsquo;t care about.</p>
<p>Even though the longterm consequence of adopting such huge numbers of UNSKILLED workers is a general downturn in economic growth stability of society as a whole as these immigrants are in fact unable to sustain a business structure based on professional skills like engineering, accounting, science and the like.</p>
<p>All&rsquo;s I can say to this is: Brooklyn, Bridge, Buyers, BOHICA?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what its really all about. Keeping wages artificially suppressed rather than letting economics work itself out. It&rsquo;s no different from US meat packers hiring illegals.</p>

		<p>If the business profits and the salaries and bonuses of business execs skyrocket 10-50-1000% in a year, it&rsquo;s considered their right, a result of their hard work and the spoils of the &#8220;free market.&#8221; If wages for workers climb 3-4% in a single year it&rsquo;s considered undeserved and a signof a &#8220;wage breakout&#8221; and a &#8220;skills shortage.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even believe the insanity of an Australian leadership that thinks Australia can handle 36 million people and will actually benefit from the overpopulation. If they think wage growth, worker &#8220;shortages,&#8221; and small populations are such a bad thing, why move everyone to Australia when they can simply move elsewhere, like India?<br>

		<p>Yes, I am sure we do need more skilled migrants, if they are educated, speak understandable English and generally fit into our society I can see no real problems.</p>
<p>But, what do we get? Boat loads of illegals, a small army of visa overstayers, plane loads of Muslims, another army of dodgy student visa overstayers and tens of thousands of &#8220;family reunion&#8221; applications as well of the UN quota of 3rd worlders. Most of all of these groups will be welfare dependant. Few will speak English and even less will fit into mainstream Australian society. Most will want to come and live in Sydney which is already bursting at the seams, has inflated house prices congested roads and relies on desalinated water.</p>
<p>We have all the social problems caused by the above as well as extensive Middle Eastern and Asian Crime Gang problems.</p>
<p>We also see many UK and South African whites who are asked to return because their 2 or 4 year work visa has expired, and being law abiding people they do as they are told. I think it is obvious the immigration is a very touchy subject here and there is a lot of double talk from the politicians.(And industry)</p>
<p>2, On public TV at present we are seeing a lot of clips about Australia&rsquo;s &#8220;Dark Past&#8221; mainly the white Australia Policy which kept all but WHITE immigrants out of this country until about 1970. I think they are showing it to give us some sort of guilt trip! BUT, it just may backfire, people are saying &#8220;&hellip;oh. the GOOD old days!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Put a fork in &#8216;em mate. They&rsquo;re done. Australia will be the first of the White nations to fall. It just cannot sustain those immigration numbers.The great flood of Chinese is only just beginning. China wants Australia. China will get Australia.In the end, the Australians did not have the gumption to keep and protect their paradise.So sad.</p>

		<p>I agree with #7 - gary. I think the boat people (really nothing compared to the influx of legal migrants - and not comparable to the number of illegals in the US as a % of population), Muslims etc are a bit of a distraction from the real issue, that is, masses of Chinese (and increasingly, Indians) staking their ethnic claim in the major cities of the country. I am obviously not for illegals and I think Islam, while nowhere the problem it is in Europe, is certainly something we need to keep our eye on, but I think legal Asian immigration is a far greater danger that has already been allowed to progress to an alarming level. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should throw in the towel just yet and give up, but I fear poster #7&rsquo;s prediction may prove right and the tide just too strong to try to stem from this far away from any foreseeable measure to do anything about it. And no, these East Asians are NOT our friends, nor do they have our interests at heart, even if they are intelligent or friendly or quiet neighbours.</p>

		<p>Agree with # 1 - 5! Particularly training Australians for jobs and/or &#8220;cheap labour&#8221; issues.</p>
<p>Re unemployment; Travel 100km or further, either North, South or West of Sydney and there are serious levels of unemployment which makes a total lie of the need to import labour.</p>
<p>Also  Travel 100km North, South or West of Sydney and there is not a Mosque, Muslim, Indian or Asian to be seen.</p>

		<p>One thing that would help here in Australia with what people have mentioned about training up our own people with the skills needed for the jobs.</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t work, you either have the Dole Bludgers who will refuse any sorts of these skilled worker training programs because they just want to sit home all day doing nothing.</p>
<p>Then you have the other bad side, a lot of unskilled workers are over 21, which means Apprenticeship/Traineeship wages are a lot higher than 16-20 year old apprentices, so then the businesses themselves who are whinging about labor shortages will not hire 21+ year old apprentices because it costs more than hiring a 16 year old.</p>
<p>Then of course you have a 3rd problem that I have seen first hand many times, ex-drug addicts looking for jobs, or even before that looking to clean themselves up and work, pay taxes all that stuff, do not get any help.</p>
<p>Especially where I live its impossible for people to get help when they are basically begging for it, the government funded Drug and Alcohol and Youth counsellors are morons who dont do their jobs.</p>
<p>Sit back collecting nice government paychecks for &#8220;helping&#8221; people, when all they do is sit back, most of them have no idea what they should even be doing for their job. Or just dont care.</p>
<p>Aussies need to start taking care of other Aussies, hire a 21+ year old Aussie apprentice over an 18 year old Sudanese refugee apprentice.</p>
<p>Take care of the people who built your damn country, instead of taking better care of the invaders and refugees that our government just keeps bringing in.</p>
