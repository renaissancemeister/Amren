			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KSAZ-TV (Phoenix), January 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One Arizona politician is offering a unique idea on how to protect our border with Mexico: a state-run militia.</p>
<p>Newly elected State Representative Jack Harper wants to introduce a bill that would create a state-sanctioned civilian force that would keep an eye on the border and report any illegal activity to police.</p>
<p>Harper says the current system in place is not enough and even takes a shot at our former Governor and current head of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano.</p>

&#8220;Border Patrol is under Janet Napolitano and that&rsquo;s not really an intimidating factor, but a military uniform person on the border makes a lot more sense,&#8221; said Harper.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>No it doesn&rsquo;t.  It just adds to the fiscal burden of a FIVE TIER bureaucratic overhead in the law enforcement system:</p>
<p>State National Guard.<br>
Texas/Arizona Rangers.<br>
Border Patrol/ICE.<br>
Local PD/Sheriff Departments.<br>
Volunteer Militias.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Under his plan, volunteers would be supervised by the Arizona National Guard and would have to pass a background check before qualifying.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>So you have to have to -wait- for a local cop or BP guy to make the arrest.  A federalizeable National Guardsmen (our real minutemen, one would think&hellip;) is required to train and perhaps lead the force.  And you have to have the cooperation of federal ICE to send these yahoos back home, regardless.</p>
<p>What I constantly remember is Barack Obama saying, on campaign, &#8220;We need a civilian security force as strong as the military!&#8221;  Which left me wondering what kind of twisted political environment we live in that the only way to get stuff done is to make sure that all forces are outside the regulatory oversight of our National Government.</p>
<p>And rest assured, if they are &#8216;certified&rsquo; in any official capacity or role, that means they can have their purpose warped or rendered toothless by the controlling agency they depend on as &#8216;observers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And if they are acting on their own when the collapse comes, that&rsquo;s just another armed gang whose local loyalties and legality comes into question without a clearly delineated chain of command.</p>
<p>If we seceded, we could cut the total number of policing agencies down to just 1-2 with statewide Illegal Immigrant authority and make them true specialists in their role abilities as far as the operating terrain and threat levels they could exclusively, successfully, operate in and against.</p>
<p>All without so much worry about arrest authority or deportation because anything in a given state would be it&rsquo;s own national jurisdiction and include a sovereign right to dump PNGs across the line of their state of origin as maintained by a hard border FENCE rather than a soft &#8216;patrol&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Throw in digital photograph biometrics and: &#8220;Try it again and we&rsquo;ll shoot you.&#8221; becomes a simple solution to repeat offenses that would rapidly end the need for the mission.</p>
<p>Our country is losing an (unfought) battle to remain fiscally whole and undivided.  It&rsquo;s time to consider the real costs of what comes after.</p>

		<p>These are State Defense Forces [SDF]. National Guard [NG] type units but not National Guard. Paramilitary strictly at the state level and not beholden to the federal government in any sense.</p>
<p>Cannot be called to active duty by the Pres or federalized.</p>
<p>ONLY about half the states have active SDF as we speak.</p>
<p>Texas, New York and Minnesota have VERY GOOD SDF. &#8220;Don&rsquo;t mess with Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>These SDF are not obligated to follow the posse comitatus law, forbidding federal troops to police the locals. More responsive even than NG or any federal police apparatus.</p>
<p>Pres O supposedly sent a National Security Letter to Govs Perry and Pawlenty instructing them NOT to increase the size of their respective SDF. This is what prompted Perry to cite the 10th amendment to the Constitution?</p>

		<p>This suggestion only makes sense if the civilian militia are armed, armored and supported by the state and allowed to shoot to kill. If this isn&rsquo;t the case, it will only be contributing to the civilian murder count in Arizona as the unarmed militia are murdered by druggers, traffikers and ILLEGAL ALIEN invaders.</p>

		<p>We have a Volunteer group of Civilians on the borders, and they have been there for a number of years. They are called the Minuteman Project, and the Minuteman Civil Defense Group. </p>
<p>Many of those that are involved in these groups are former Military men, many of whom served in the Army Infantry, and Marines. </p>
<p>I am familar with these groups, and have kept up with their web sites, and know that each member has to undergo a full Background check, and have their fingerprints taken. </p>
<p>These American Patriots have been called everything in the book from the Far Left, which includes the blanket &#8220;Racist&#8221; term, to &#8220;Vigilante&#8221;. The hostile, Militant, Radical Left though, and groups like La Raza, are nothing to concern ouselves with,  according to the Controlled Media. Their Hypocrisy knows no bounds.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s implement what I had suggested many times before, which is to Deputize the Minutemen, and give them the Power of Probable Cause, Search and Seizure, and Arrest within their State, or Municipality where they are assigned, along the Border Towns.</p>
<p>These Minutemen should be given the flexibility to fire upon those crossing our Southern border, since most of those that do, are trafficking drugs, and are engaged in Human trafficking, as well. These are two legged animals, not people, that engage in this type of behavior, and need to be dealt with accordingly.</p>

		<p>The civilian security force as &#8220;powerful as the military&#8221; President Oogabooga says he wants has been done many times in history.</p>
<p>In revolutionary France, the Jacobins had a membership of some 420,000.  It was their muscle that made the Reign of Terror possible.</p>
<p>In Haiti, Papa Doc Duvalier created the Ton Ton Macoutes in 1959 as a paramilitary force strictly loyal to himself.  The state terrorism that the combination of Duvalier and the Ton Ton Macouts produced involved a disgusting mixture of corruption, extortion and assassination.  The Ton Ton Macoutes were vital in the rigged 1961 election and again in the rigged 1964 referendum that enthroned him as President For Life.</p>
<p>In Italy in 1919, the Squadristi (blackshirts) were organized, and by Mussolini&rsquo;s march on Rome in 1922, they numbered 200,000.  The march itself numbered only 30,000 men, but the King feared a civil war if he involved the army, since the blackshirts had already taken over much of the country, including the Po Valley, Italy&rsquo;s industrial heartland.</p>
<p>The real dinner-winner though were the brownshirts, or SA in Germany during the 1920s and early 30s.  At their peak, they numbered 3 million men.  Since the German army was limited to only 100,000 - with no heavy artillery or tanks - by the Treaty of Versailles, it is obvious that once a Nazi government took power that no attempt by the army to overthrow it could possibly succeed.  The SA was eventually purged and replaced by the SS, which grew into a large combat formation again outside the regular army&rsquo;s chain of command.  By 1944, the SS was receiving all of the conscripts over 175 cm in height (5&rsquo;9&#8221;) and better equipment than the army.  Again, the object can only have been to prevent the army from overthrowing the government, no matter how distasteful they found it&rsquo;s policies and no matter how ruinous thouse policies were proving for the nation.  The strength of the SS was not merely military and political; it was the SS that derived the profits from exploitation of conquered territory and forced labor; when an industrialist like Alfred Krupp wanted to use Poles or Russian POWs in one of his factories, he generally paid the SS.  An additional non-SS source of forced labor was also controlled by the Nazi heirarchy, and that was Organization Todt, which employed 1.4 million laborers, of these 1% were Germans rejected for military service, 1.5% were concentration camp inmates and the rest were prisoners of war and forced labor from occupied countries.</p>
<p>The Nazis were not the only ones to do this; the Soviet NKVD enjoyed enormous economic power by virtue of its control of production in the Gulag system.  The NKVD also controlled Soviet nuclear weapons development and the attendant large budgets.  This was in addition to their power to arbitrarily arrest and execute military officers; the army cound never have coordinated the overthrow of the Soviet regieme.</p>
<p>President Oogabooga is certainly aware of the previous existances of the sort of organization he wants, as well as the sorts of purposes to which they have been historically put.  Any suggestion that he is not cognisant of this is preposterous.<br>
