<h1>Rep. Moran: GOP Won Midterms Due to Racism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry J. Reske, Newmax, January 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. James Moran, D-Va., told an Arab-language television network that Republicans swept to victory in the 2010 midterm elections because many Americans don&rsquo;t want to be ruled by a black man. {snip}</p>
<p>In an interview with the U.S.-funded Alhurra network, which is Arabic for &#8220;the free one,&#8221; Moran asserted that the Democratic losses in the midterm elections &#8220;happened because of the same reason the Civil War happened in the United States. The Civil War happened because the Southern states, particularly the slave-holding states, didn&rsquo;t want to see a president who was opposed to slavery.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case a lot of people in this country, I believe, don&rsquo;t want to be governed by an African-American, particularly one who is inclusive, who is liberal, who wants to spend money on everyone and who wants to reach out to include everyone in our society. That&rsquo;s a basic philosophical clash,&#8221; the Post reported Moran as saying.</p>
<p>Moran spokeswoman Anne Hughes said in a statement that there are nearly &#8220;1,000 identified hate groups in the U.S., and recent studies showing a majority of Americans believe racism is still widespread against African-Americans. It is no secret that our country has and continues to struggle with racial equality. The Congressman was expressing his frustration with this problem and the role it played in the last election,&#8221; the Post said.</p>

		<p>Dear Rep. Moron,<br>
Why is it that Democrats are so focused on racism?  Why can&rsquo;t the GOP be focused on policy disputes and not have those issues reduced to racism?  Why is it when US citizens are tired of your rhetoric, you move on to an Arab audience?  Why is it when history doesn&rsquo;t suit your arguments, you change history?  Why is it when you don&rsquo;t agree with some group you classify them as a hate group as a way to stifle free speech?<br>

<p>A civilization can not exist without sacrifice. If you want food, you have to grow it, if you want shelter you have to build it, etc. But some people do not want to work. They just want the reward. So to them we say: &#8220;Contribute (aka &#8216;bigotry&rsquo;) or go away (aka &#8216;discrimination&rsquo;)&#8221;</p>
<p>By forcing us to &#8220;include everyone in our society&#8221; people begin to say &#8220;Gee, why should I work when I can just leech off of others like Mr XXX?&#8221; </p>
<p>The idea that inclusion is morally superior to exclusion is the most dangerous myth ever invented, IMO. </p>

		<p>What a deranged liberal.  Does he think that Arabs hold the same goofy egalitarian beliefs that he does?  Arabs call blacks &#8220;bantu&#8221; in the middle east and they are looked as as being below dogs.  They certainly wouldn&rsquo;t fault any white American for not wanting to be ruled by one.  </p>

		<p>Such verbal gaffes by the left need to be spread far and wide. Keep up the good work Mora(o)n, and keep calling all those average Whites that back the Tea Parties racists!<br>
If we could only keep the Tea Party-types from immediately apologizing for being White, we would score some political points against the Marxists.</p>

		<p>Moran is partially right, oddly enough. Americans DON&rsquo;T want to be ruled by a man who spends money on everyone, and who considers everyone opposed to his policies to be the enemy. Why is Moran letting this bug him?</p>
<p>Many blacks stayed home on Election Day, 2010. They CHOSE not to vote. How is this a problem of inclusiveness?</p>
<p>Why is the U.S. government funding the Alhurra network, which is an Islamic mouthpiece? I thought the separation of church and state applied to ALL denominations in this country.</p>

		<p>I apologize to Jim Moron for America not meeting his illustriously high standards.  The door is that way, if you care.</p>
<p>A lot of the same people who &#8220;didn&rsquo;t want to be ruled by a black man&#8221; in 2010 did want to be &#8220;ruled by a black man&#8221; in 2008.</p>
<p>By the way, Jim Moron, the President isn&rsquo;t supposed to be ruler, he or she is supposed to be the chief executive of one of three co-equal branches of a Federal government that itself has limited powers.</p>
<p>I find it ironic that Moron is saying this to Arabs.  A few years after he died, Hollywood did a movie about the life of Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian leader who approved the dam on the Nile.  They cast a black man to play Sadat.  This so infuriated Egyptians that there were protests in the streets, and a diplomatic chill between the U.S. and Egypt.</p>

<p>Why should equality be a &#8220;struggle&#8221;?  If it exists in nature, then the battle is won. If it doesn&rsquo;t exist, then you have to struggle against nature.  Everybody loses, except the race hustling scam artist, and also those Whitey liberal elites who are forced to step down and give up their jobs/careers to more deserving people of color, a move toward poetic justice that we all support!</p>

		<p> Yes, Congressman Moran, of course the Republicans swept to a big off-year victory because American White people cannot stand the idea of a black president. Of course. Naturally.</p>
<p> But seriously, folks, when are the Democrats going to stop using &#8220;racism&#8221; as the default excuse for every Republican victory? Never, probably. It&rsquo;s too easy, too handy, to use that as the fallback excuse.</p>
<p> Much easier than facing a lousy economy, an unpopular health-care bill passed against overwhelming public opposition, a shady chief executive who may or may not have even been born on American soil   &mdash;   and on, and on. No, no, much easier and safer to yell &#8220;Racism!&#8221; By the way, how did a Democrat with such views ever get elected in a conservative state like Virginia. </p>

<p>Moran is wrong about why the Civil War happened.  It happened because the Confederate States of America was invaded by the army of a hostile neighboring nation.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Rep. Moran: GOP Won Midterms Due to Racism&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a perfect example of a true political hack without any morals or ethics, thinking only of staying in power at all costs.</p>
<p>His constituency?  A very large non-white population.  He says what he says, because he knows it&rsquo;s what his constituents want to hear.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the biggest race traitors in the country today.</p>

		<p>Reality check time, Moron.</p>
<p>Obama lacked sufficient delegates to win the presidential nomination outright, so for the first time ever super delegates to the Democratic National Convention were empowered to choose the nominee. Behind the scenes, Obama&rsquo;s campaign threatened a national boycott by black voters across the USA if Hillary Clinton was selected. The prospect of losing ballot races in all fifty states frightened the Democrats into nominating Obama. Even if Obama lost the election (he won comfortably), the mere threat of black voters sitting out the general election proved that the Democrats are totally dependent upon the black voters. </p>

		<p>News Flash Rep. Moron&hellip;.if it weren&rsquo;t for the WHITE VOTE, Obama would have never been elected President, you idiot. So, how can America be as racist as you want to believe or claim that it is? </p>
<p>The Democrat&rsquo;s lost the midterms because people are finally waking up and embarrassed that they were sold down the river on a crock of &#8220;Hope &amp; Change&#8221; that Obama could never deliver. Far too many gullible, and stupid people in this country. Obama the &#8220;snake oil salesman&#8221; being elected President is certainly proof of that. </p>

		<p>Rep. Moran is wrong on his history, and he misinforms his Arab listeners.  Whatever the causes of the American Civil War [aka the War of Northern Aggression], then President-Elect Lincoln&rsquo;s opposition to the institution of slavery was NOT one of them.  Lincoln was absolutely clear with anyone who would listen that he would not move to abolish slavery. [Whether just where then legal, or nationwide, I am not clear.]  In fact, Lincoln took the extra constitutional step of approving a proposed Amendment to protect slavery.  The goal of freeing the slaves came after the war started.  </p>

		<p>The one thing that stuck with me through the entire 2008 election cycle was the constant use of the prejudice card against the conservative candidates. <br>
Yet the many of the same people who were throwing it were basing thier vote on either sex (Hilary) or race (Obama. During this time I heard from many voters as we discussed the election,&#8221;It`s time for a woman president. Or &#8220;it`s time for a black president&#8221;.<br>
These voter based their selection for the president of the US on either sex or race. I suppose that this was easier than  actually paying attention to the issues facing the country and voting for a candidate that could make the right choices for the country.<br>
A few of my friends who claimed to be liberals were really conservatives and didnt know it. I asked a few simple questions. <br>
Is it right for the government to take your money and give it to someone else who doesnt work and probably never will as long as &#8220;assistance&#8221; programs are available.<br>
Is it right for the government to tell you who you have to like and dislike?<br>
Is it right for the governement to tell you that you cant hire who you want in your business whether you have received government assistance in starting your business or not?<br>
Is the goverment too big and intrusive in our everyday lives?<br>
One of my friends,who was a liberal until this conversation, used this allusion. &#8220;Eventually the governement will make everyone wear green socks on Tuesday.&#8221; <br>
Hes a little out there but the sentiment was understandable.<br>
The one thing that a lot of people dont undersatnd or purposely misconstrue is the term tolernace.<br>
To me it means tolerate or put up with something I dont really care for. It doesnt mean I have to like it or them for that matter. I dont hate anyone. I still have friends from different social classes and races. <br>
I am concerned that white people like myself are rapidly becoming the scapegoat and cash cow of the US. Its not the fault of the person but rather the fault of the system that we have in place that rewards people for doing nothing but standing in line and voting for the candidate who promises me something for nothing.<br>
In closing I would like to use a cliche <br>
&#8221; I used to be disgusted now I am just amused.&#8221; <br>
The powers that be have blinded themselves to the fact that we can see right through their thin veils and gaze upon the faces of the real racists that run America.</p>

<p>Yeah.  So?  Where is that black man who has ever governed a nation well?  Based on the actual history of black governance, the odds are not good.  And why should I want to &#8220;spend money on everyone&#8221; or &#8220;include everyone in our society&#8221;.  Who but a fool would want to do such a thing?</p>

		<p> He&rsquo;s right of course. The mid term elections were a knee jerk reation by whites that are enraged by the abuses we have suffered for the last fifty years. The people were awakened by the infamous Bill Clinton speech and now see what a minority  POTUS will do to us. Immigration and attacks on our values have never been more direct and blatent. What do they expect us to do lay down and whimper? That&rsquo;s not a white thing to do. We have been patient because the politicians said &#8220;This inconvienence will be temporary and you have to give us a chance to help the less fortunate.&#8221; Well after over fifty years we relise that the less fortunate aren&rsquo;t going to rise out of that wheelchair and walk.</p>

<p>A black man and white man are running for President.  Ask blacks who do they want to be President?  The answer is 98% want the black man.  The verdict by the Rep. Morans of the world:  this is great blacks are proud of their race.</p>
<p>Ask whites who do they want to be President?  The answer is 68% want the white man.  The verdict by the Rep. Morans of the world:  this is racism.</p>
<p>Mentally healthy white people want white rulers.  And although some people have said America does not have rulers, they are dead wrong.  We are ruled, maybe not as fully ruled as the Soviet Union was, but ruled none the less.<br>

		<p>   Moran is an idiot. He doesn&rsquo;t have any idea what the cause of the &#8220;civil war&#8221; was. Like all democrat politicians, he isn&rsquo;t interested in cause and effect, he is only interested in grovelling to the liberals and making huge money in payoffs whilst selling the country down the river. He will make his, and to Hell with the rest of us. Multiculturalism and political correctness are but two of the diseases killing this country. They think the country is polarized now?

<p>Right on the nail - since &#8216;94 here in SA we have had a majority black government - and the country is *rapidly* declining now. Corruption scandal after scandal (including the MFIC, Zuma). And look at Zimbabwe just north of us - what a complete F-up. Seriously, you guys are (were) crazy voting for a black (well half-white) prez. </p>
<p>I bet you won&rsquo;t make that mistake again.</p>

		<p>I think that argument is downright silly.  You&rsquo;d think a lot of people woke up one day and suddenly realized, &#8220;Hey, Obama&rsquo;s black!&#8221;</p>

		<p>To the last poster:  NO, these people will never, ever stop complaining because many of them know deep down inside that they don&rsquo;t have the intelligence, maturity, and motivation to function in a western society. To your list of &#8220;racist&#8221; matters, I&rsquo;ll add:  being white and having a dog and weapons-racist, getting good grades-racist, not being obese-racist, taking responsibility for one own&rsquo;s life-racist, staying out of trouble and not racking up felonies-racist. In sum, because too many blacks have low IQ&rsquo;s, poor self-control and emotional problems, the list is endless.  So forget about their stupid complaining  &mdash;  they&rsquo;ll do it regardless.  The point is we can&rsquo;t afford, nor should pay for subidizing their endless, pathological behaviours. </p>

		<p>Moran is a jerk and bully.  He is concerned only with his future in politics.  He is akin to a traitor, but the MSM won&rsquo;t say so.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not all that impressed with the Tea Party and their anti-racism in finding black conservatives to represent them or never ending praise of MLK. I&rsquo;m not 100 percent convinced that the 2010 elections brought in new faces and people that are ideologically different from Ken Mehlman&rsquo;s GOP.   </p>
