			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rory Mulholland, Daily Telegraph (Sydney), January 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BATMAN has battled many enemies but now has to face the anger of rightwing bloggers furious that the comic book caped crusader has recruited a Muslim to run his crime-fighting franchise in Paris.</p>
<p>&#8220;The character&rsquo;s name is Bilal Asselah and he is an Algerian Sunni Muslim and an immigrant that is physically fit and adept at the gymnastic sport parkour,&#8221; wrote Warner Todd Huston on his site Publius Forum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently Batman couldn&rsquo;t find any actual Frenchman to be the &#8216;French saviour&rsquo;,&#8221; wrote the rightwinger, apparently discounting the millions of French citizens of North African descent from his definition of &#8220;actual&#8221; French.</p>
<p>In the December issues of DC Comics Detective Comics Annual and Batman Annual, the caped crusader decides to set up Batman Incorporated and install a superhero in cities around the world to fight crime.</p>
<p>The hero he picks in France is called Nightrunner, the alter ego of a 22-year-old from Clichy-sous-Bois, a tough Paris suburb where urban unrest sparked riots in immigrant districts across France in 2005.</p>
<p>Bilal Asselah, a Frenchman of Algerian origin, was caught up in that unrest and at one point he and his friend got beaten up by police who mistook them for rioters.</p>
<p>Bilal&rsquo;s friend reacted by later burning down a police station and ended up being killed by police.</p>
<p>But Bilal, thanks largely to the influence of his pious Muslim mother, rejects hate and fear.</p>
<p>He concentrates on learning parkour, the form of acrobatics where practitioners jump from buildings and leap over walls and street furniture, as spectacularly seen at the start of the 2006 James Bond film &#8220;Casino Royale.&#8221;</p>
<p>When riots again threaten to engulf his neighbourhood, Bilal puts on a mask and, using his parkour skills, becomes Nightrunner and sets out to set things right again.</p>
<p>His integrity, athletic prowess, and triumph over personal adversity made him Bruce Wayne&rsquo;s obvious choice to represent Batman in Paris.</p>
<p>But in the United States, rightwing bloggers are incensed that DC Comics chose to make their new superhero a Muslim and see it as pandering to political correctness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, readers of Batman will not be helped to understand what troubles are really besetting France,&#8221; wrote Huston on Publius Forum.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this age when Muslim youths are terrorizing the entire country, heck in this age of international Muslim terrorism assaulting the whole world, Batman&rsquo;s readers will be confused by what is really going on in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through it all DC makes a Muslim in France a hero when French Muslims are at the center of some of the worst violence in the country&rsquo;s recent memory,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>The Angry White Dude blog, which described Islam as the &#8220;religion of murder,&#8221; mocked that &#8220;Nightrunner the Muslim sidekick will have strange new powers to bury women to their waists and bash their heads in with large rocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>US comic book creator Bosch Fawstin, who wrote on his blog that &#8220;DC Comics has submitted to Islam,&#8221; is coming up with his own antidote.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re as sick and tired of this IslamiCrap as I am, be on the lookout for my upcoming graphic novel, The Infidel, which features Pigman, an ex-Muslim superhero who is the jihadist&rsquo;s worst nightmare,&#8221; he blogged.</p>
<p>DC comics did not respond to an AFP request for an interview with David Hine, the writer of the album featuring Nightrunner.</p>
<p>But the British-born author told a US website that he had tried to &#8220;come up with the kind of hero I would want to see in a comic book if I were French.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The urban unrest and problems of the ethnic minorities under (President Nicolas) Sarkozy&rsquo;s government dominate the news from France and it became inevitable that the hero should come from a French Algerian background,&#8221; he told the Death and Taxes site.</p>
<p>The mini-storm on the English-language blogosphere  &mdash;  where left-leaning or pro-Islam sites are attacking the rightwingers for their hostility to a Muslim superhero  &mdash;  has so far only sparked a tiny number of reactions on French-language websites.</p>
<p>The albums went on sale last month but the small numbers stocked were quickly sold out, bookstores said.<br>

The reason we don&rsquo;t see minority comic book figures is because minorities lack the creative spark to create their own heroes.</p>
<p>My hope is that the comic book crowd wake up to the fact that they are being deliberately manipulated and they are little more than an a social engineering experiment at this point. </p>

		<p>Of course this absurd pandering is coming from a British author.  Leftists take whatever the truth is and turn it around 180 degrees. The real question is what does this pandering accomplish?  I doubt anyone&rsquo;s opinion of moslems will be improved because of a liberal Islam apologist.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. Because if muslims are &#8220;beaten up&#8221; by French police, it&rsquo;s obviously because they were &#8220;mistaken&#8221; for rioters, and Islamic mothers tell their sons to be peaceful and tolerant, rather than murderous. Only in leftwing fantasyland.</p>

		<p>Batman Inc. sounds far too much like &#8216;Global War On Terror&rsquo; as an excuse to force common law enforcement on already corrupted countries that don&rsquo;t need FBI/Interpol help to become more overarching and debased.  Batman has always been at his best (escapist white male vigilantism) as an outsider whose actions rode the line between justice and terrorism.  And so he represents a poor choice as a superhero to go corporate when you already have Bruce Wayne as a politically compromised industrialist.</p>
<p>Past which, &#8216;Le Vrai Français&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t be caught dead with their uptight, upright, noses in an American Graphic Novel.  And I am proud of them for that.</p>
<p>Is &#8216;Nightrunner&rsquo; a fair depiction of an affronted minority in France?  Only if you actually assume that DC will deal with smileys, honor killings, cultural rape of outsiders as a justifiable privilege and the general view of their host nations as deserving to be trampled by Islam.</p>
<p>Of course this is nothing new, one could equally ask: &#8216;Is Batman a fair depiction of the actual ethnic composition of American crime?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Comicland is a parallel liberal earth for immature minds who cannot stand the reality of a world beyond the dark chivalry of their own tame imaginings.  In the real world, racism has a purpose because it is all that protects the genes which create and ennoble society.  For the group that protects their genius.</p>
<p>Showing this would destroy the innocence of the subculture, deservedly perhaps.</p>

		<p>The Algerian Muslim readers of DC will be sure to eat this up. What&rsquo;s that, there are no readers who fit that demographic? Oh well, Mr. Hine feels like he&rsquo;s being inclusive and tolerant. At least someone gets something out of this.</p>

		<p>The next thing I anticipate on seeing is that Batman will retire and pass on his legacy to a black or Mexican.  I grew up on DC Comics and they were as American as apple pie.  With some of the things I&rsquo;m seeing in the media about them now, I can&rsquo;t say that now.  They seem to be incapable of creating unique minority characters and they&rsquo;ll take someone like Green Lantern and turn him into a black guy.  Honestly, how many black kids out there read comic books anyhow to justify this sort of thing?  Another thing is DC has been tinkering with Wonder Woman&rsquo;s costume for years now.  They replaced the eagle emblem on her bustier with a &#8220;W&#8221; and just six months ago they gave her a new look and ditched the star spangled outfit with a leotard and jacket.  The reason should be obvious because her original costume was fashioned out of the American flag and DC wants to stamp out any connection to the red, white and blue.  </p>

<p>I know zilch about comic books, so forgive me. But might it be that these types (the &#8220;oppressed urban youths&#8221; described above) are the ones who buy comic books in France?  These are the types who could identify with Bilal Asselah,  and so are the market being targeted by the publisher?  As always, money talks louder than patriotism.</p>

		<p>What the French need, is to redo Asterix &amp; Obelix with black Muslims invading and the last racially aware Frenchman fighting back from the brink of only one village, a brave stand against unmentionable odds!! Oh wait now it sounds just like South-Africa.</p>
<p>But seriously pop culture is extremely important, if we are going to get our message across we need: comic books, pop music, comic strip, rock music and more comedy, all carrying our message.           <br>

		<p>Here is one idea: Over the years I have seen some pretty funny comments on Amren, there should at least be one or two fans who can do a bit of digging on the Amren website. Mr. Taylor then puts a slim book together with the funniest and most remarkable comments over the years.</p>

		<p>Maybe some customers bought the comic in hopes of having valuable collector items when such a controversial series ends.<br>
This all reminded me of the French movie Crimson Rivers.  It was adapted from a book in which one of the protagonists is a French Arab cop.  In the film, however, this same character has an Armenian name and is portrayed by Vincent Cassel.  The creators probably figured that the mainly French, British, and American audiences wouldn&rsquo;t go for a French Arab hero.  I believe they were right.</p>

		<p>Another example of blacks being incapable of originating anything on their own that whites and others would be envious enough to emulate&hellip;so whites give up a super hero (even in comics/mythology).</p>
<p>Watch bet tv and you&rsquo;ll see why they need to steal existing white characters and never capitalize on their own creations.  Their own creations are degenerate and ignorant, barely articulate.</p>

During the riots (oops,I mean demonstrations) by the oppressed, underprivileged &#8220;youths&#8221; (in which they had no part, btw), they were seized and (wrongly) beaten by the brutal racist police.<br>
And later, his friend was killed by the police.<br>
(All he had done was burn a police station in justified revenge.)<br>
But his pious Moslem mother turned him away from hatred.And he set about a life of defending justice and fighting crime.</p>
<p>Yeah, right! And you know the story about a bridge in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Normally, I would say &#8220;you can&rsquo;t make this stuff up&#8221;,  but they DID make this stuff up!</p>
