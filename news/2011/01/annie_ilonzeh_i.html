		<p>I won&rsquo;t watch it. I&rsquo;ll bet the new series will be just like the movie, (which I didn&rsquo;t see, either). I bet they won&rsquo;t use guns either; unlike the original Angels who were adept at using firearms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet the series tanks halfway though its first season.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, Hawaii Five-O&#8221; was redone. Now, &#8220;Charlie&rsquo;s Angels&#8221;. What next, &#8220;My Three Sons&#8221;, with a gay father?</p>

		<p>&#8220;And the show will be based in Miami&#8221; All I need to know. Wolfie`s deli and the Coppertone sign are long gone and so am I. What I loved about the original show was the way they showcased seventies Santa Barbara and area. Marina`s and restraunts as far as the eye could see. It`s like taking a travel valium. Same with Elvis movies but tht`s another story.</p>

		<p>I thought political correctness was about as bad as it could get in the past, but it continues to exceed my expectations. Now it&rsquo;s obviously not possible to have a show today WITH ONLY THREE CHARACTERS without one of them needing to be black (albeit a very light-skinned one)! Not only that, but she has to be the smartest one of the bunch, of course. </p>
<p>I always viewed the concept of blacks having to be represented in every form of white entertainment as a form of tyranny, and my opinion is only confirmed. Not only is it necessary to inject a black character into every entertainment, but the black has to be the smartest, most well-adjusted character of all to avoid the dreaded charges of &#8220;racism.&#8221; </p>
<p>Where does it all end? Nowhere, as far as  I can see, as once the trend is started, it heads down that slippery slope of ever-increasing political correctness. Expect the remake of &#8220;Cagney and Lacey&#8221; in which at least one member of the pair is black, for there&rsquo;s obviously a pressure to keep outdoing one another in entertainment when it comes to political correctness. The culmination will be a remake of Columbo in which Peter Falk is replaced by Eddie Murphy.</p>

		<p>This is a common tactic of the PC Gestapo - portraying minority actors in roles where they are to be perceived as having an above average IQ.</p>
<p>Take the show Modern Family for instance - the young white child is portrayed as a bumbling moron who runs through screen doors like a dog and claims to not remember how many times he fell on his head as a child - real laughers.  But the Columbian child is portrayed as an intellectual that is bored by activities others his age find fun and would rather sip a cappuccino and contemplate the meaning of modern society.</p>
<p>But guess which of the two kids is in real life a member of MENSA?  Go ahead, google it.  I guarantee you won&rsquo;t be surprised.</p>

<p>First the make James West black, then the make Thor black, now they are making Charlies Angels black. If Jacklyn Smith had three hand, she would be doing a triple face palm.</p>
<p>Since minorities are so spectacular in medicine, science, and the arts. Why don&rsquo;t they get some minorities to write some new scripts for Hollywood. Seems the people who run it now, can&rsquo;t come up with anything new. </p>
<p>I have an idea for a new, original, and unique show. We have a single black mother taking care of her children, who forms a musical band. I&rsquo;ll call it &#8220;The Partridge Family.&#8221; Another one of my ideas is to have a lonely black guy with three sons who marries a lonely black woman with three daughters. I&rsquo;ll call it &#8220;The Brady Bunch.&#8221; OK, one more. It will be a story about a black kid named Eddie, who lost his mother, and is growing up with his father. It&rsquo;ll be called &#8220;Eddies Father.&#8221; That should take care of the three networks for the next 2 years. I&rsquo;ll have some new original shows by then.<br>

		<p>They already remade this show into two movies and recast one of the characters as a Chinese woman and in the second film they made Bosley black.  One thing about the original Charlie&rsquo;s Angels is that these actresses were three beautiful women.  Do you think Annie Ilonzeh is in the same league with them?  I think the main reason that shows like this are still popular is because of the nostalgia.  I hardly ever watch TV anymore because the programming has been deteriorating for quite some time.  Viewing some reality show set in a restaurant is about as interesting as watching the grass grow. I buy alot of DVDs of old movies and TV series.  It takes me back to a time when things were better in this country plus I get to see how much nicer cities and areas of the country looked 30-40 years ago. That&rsquo;s the reason I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be able to reproduce the earlier success of these shows even if the entire cast was all White.  That era has come and gone.      </p>

On checking, I find she was born Annie Ngasi Ilonzeh, near Dallas.  There&rsquo;s extremely little info on her background.</p>
<p>Is she half-Arabic? Somali?  Moslem too?  If so, Hollywood scored two (or three) &#8220;minority&#8221; hits with one stone.</p>

		<p>I won&rsquo;t watch it either.  You cannot suspend your disbelief enough to enjoy the plot.  In real life, I bet that black actress doesn&rsquo;t hang around with white women.</p>
<p>I also buy older sitcoms and movies on DVD and show them to my kids.  They love those shows.  Most modern shows are so poorly put together, even if they are designed for short-attention spans with lots of flash and crash.</p>

		<p>Do you ever pay attention to TV commercials?  Notice that the &#8220;smart, serious&#8221; one is always black.  The goofy, clueless person is usually white.  Just observe the commercials the next time you sit in front of the TV. You&rsquo;ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>Anti-Whiteness is so pervasive on TV and in the movies that I believe profit is secondary to getting their message out.  You can&rsquo;t watch TV for 20 minutes anymore without seeing Whites protrayed in a negative way or miscegenation.  I also have problem with the profanity and the anti-Christian themes that are becoming way too commonplace. The best way to send them a message is get rid of the cable or satellite dish and tell the provider why.  In a few months Charlies Angels (in diversity) will join the other failed ethnic remakes like Kojak and the Honeymooners.  </p>

		<p>If the producers let these Angels have guns, will this one hold hers sideways?</p>
<p>Light-skinned blacks are a far greater threat to the rights and liberties of white people than dark-skinned blacks (who are, of course, serious threats in their own way). Light-skinned blacks are always trying to have it both ways, calling themselves black when affirmative action and government benefits are being handed out, but lightening their skin, straightening and dyeing their hair, and having plastic surgery on their noses when it&rsquo;s time for the white-dominated awards show. They engage in two utterly contradictory forms of bigotry. First, they claim their blackness makes them morally superior to white people. Then they claim their light skin makes them superior to dark-skinned blacks.</p>
<p>I know an octaroon (1/8 black, 7/8 white) woman who only has her job because she&rsquo;s filling a black quota. Now get this. When she meets new people, particularly men she&rsquo;s interested in dating, she openly tries to &#8220;pass&#8221; as white. The hypocrisy is utterly vile.</p>

		<p>I have doubts as to whether anti-white bias of producers is the main motivating force.</p>
<p>If you watch the NFL on Sunday, note the commercials: the products are for men, and the White males are generally portrayed as intelligent and competent, non-White males are companions and co-participants. Note that men, especially White men, are the major part of the audience, and commercial time is very expensive. </p>
<p>If you monitor programs where White men are negatively portrayed in the show and in the commercials, note the products that are being advertised: they almost all for women. Those for products not sexually oriented i.e. real estate, car insurance, usually have women in the prominent roles.  </p>
<p>My conclusion is that the advertising is using existing attitudes of the groups that it is targeting. Female audiences respond positively to smart women and stupid White men.</p>

		<p>  I can&rsquo;t say I liked the vapid, formulaic detective show anyway, but there is really no artistic reason to re-make Charlie&rsquo;s Angels in black-face. Immature Hollywood executives love to remake the mediocre movies and television shows from their youth with black stars in roles previously acted by whites. None of the thirty something executives read, so they have to get their plots somewhere. I have no strong objection to making another insipid clone of Charlie&rsquo;s Angels with Ms. Annie Ilonseh. I really have nothing against this young lady.</p>

		<p>One thing I don&rsquo;t understand about this is that the original show didn&rsquo;t have characters named Kate, Abby and Marisa.  If it isn&rsquo;t going to stick to the original venue then why not rename the show and give it some originality and say it&rsquo;s based on Charlie&rsquo;s Angels?  Can you imagine a revisioned Dukes of Hazzard with a black actor and the White role cast by a religious minority?  The General Lee replaced with a thugged out Escalade named the Rev. King?  Both of them fighting for social justice in a small racist Southern town?  Speaking of Robert Wagner, I saw an internet blog about a possible remake of Hart to Hart starring Beyonce Knowles and Jayzee, whomever that is.  Nothing surprises me anymore. </p>

		<p>She could be a nice and smart girl, I wish her luck. It&rsquo;s sad that so many black male  actors who played &#8220;good policemen&#8221; turned out to be violent thugs, drug addicts, etc in real life. I will give some examples: Phillip Micheal Thomas of &#8220;Miami Vice&#8221;, Howard E. Rollins Jr of &#8220;In the Heat of the Night&#8221;, and the people&rsquo;s favorite, O.J. Simpson of &#8220;The Naked Gun&#8221;. It&rsquo;s sad and horrifying. I wish those guys were those nice people that they play on screen&hellip;.they are not. </p>
<p>I think that &#8220;My Three Sons&#8221; with a gay father will be hilarious. I think the best choices for the lead role would be Harvey Feierstein, George Clooney or Rue Paul.</p>

		<p>This is WONDERFUL I know when I go to a movie, watch a television show or even see a commercial that when the black person arrives the day is saved. The poor dimwitted white people can now breath easy the great kings and queens of days gone by have arrived and a new a better day is on the horizon.</p>
<p>Seriously though it is getting a little sickening when the truth of what these people can and have done is so distorted that a young inexperienced person watching it might think this fantasy is really true. Look how nice they made Detroit when they drove the white devils out?<br>
I seldom watch TV anymore I now it is fantasy but there is a limit to even what fantasy should be.</p>

		<p>17 - Anonymous.  Interesting comment on commercials.  Here in the UK it is very rare to see a  TV commercial with an entire white cast, even in the cartoon form.  If a newspaper is writing up a story on property or finances the couple chosen to take part are  nearly always mixed - one of each.  Even worse is the BBC who have a children&rsquo;s channel for preschools where most presenters are from ethnic minorities (or if white, extremely odd!!).  The &#8216;message&rsquo; must even be got across to the very young.  What I object to is that I can see the &#8216;brainwashing&rsquo; but can do nothing about it&hellip;!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a shame how PC ruins great shows. Shows are actually better now than they&rsquo;ve ever been but the endless stain and presence of Political Correctness and Multiculturalism makes one grit his/her teeth while enjoying an episode.

		<p>I won&rsquo;t watch this garbage or anything remade &#8220;black&#8221;.<br>
White American culture is under attack 24/7.<br>
All that is white MUST now be black.<br>
All that is black MUST remain black, forever!</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does it all end? Nowhere, as far as I can see, as once the trend is started, it heads down that slippery slope of ever-increasing political correctness. Expect the remake of &ldquo;Cagney and Lacey&rdquo; in which at least one member of the pair is black, for there&rsquo;s obviously a pressure to keep outdoing one another in entertainment when it comes to political correctness. The culmination will be a remake of Columbo in which Peter Falk is replaced by Eddie Murphy.&#8221;</p>
<p>**************</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna end Tim until we make it end.  They&rsquo;re doing this in everything.  Claiming Blacks invented this and invented that. They will obliterate our entire history at some point and claim Blacks discovered America and Blacks even went to the moon.  Their goal is becoming quite obvious - Destroy everything about the White man - his history, heritage, accomplishments - everything.  AND - give the credit for all that he has accomplished to Blacks and other races.</p>

<p>The octaroon your talking about obviously looks black if she&rsquo;s filling a black quota and couldn&rsquo;t pass for White if she wanted to.</p>

		<p>One of my childhood memories was &#8220;Zoom&#8221;, produced by PBS in Boston. Even in the early 70&rsquo;s they tried to force integration down our throats. It would have been a good show, but they kept forcing the integration on us.  It annoyed all races.  I actually liked the black and hispanic kids, but they were always placing them in front of the white kids, and giving them more lines. This subtly racist directing did not make me more &#8220;accepting&#8221;. It made me angry and racially aware at an early age.</p>

		<p>@7 -  They didn&rsquo;t make Thor black, just Heimdall.  Apparently, in Marvel&rsquo;s Yarlson story Heimdall was *not white* and they&rsquo;re basing the movie off that. I think that&rsquo;s a thin excuse to cover their infiltration of  yet another white-only mythos to suit their agenda.  All them black vikings, right?  I can&rsquo;t wait for when Ryan Reynolds gets to play the Black Panther, riiiight? ;-)  </p>

<p>You have succinctly described not only the &#8220;tragic mulato&#8221; but most every black who in reality secretly wishes he was white, but since he can&rsquo;t be what he desires, he viciously seeks out to destroy it.</p>

<p>I agree completely.  Not to denigrate Blacks, but I know that if I were Black I&rsquo;d want to be White and to have a White woman.  It&rsquo;s really not too hard to figure it out.  If you were Black wouldn&rsquo;t you want to be White?  And if you couldn&rsquo;t, which Blacks can&rsquo;t be, although more and more Blacks are bedding down with White women thanks to media influence on the minds of young White girls, wouldn&rsquo;t you blame Whites for your problems and try to destroy them if you couldn&rsquo;t face the fact that you could never be White?  Really, the way I see it, it&rsquo;s a case of pure jealousy, looking at Whites and realizing at some level that they&rsquo;re more intelligent and better looking than you are, wouldn&rsquo;t you have hostility to Whites based on what amounts to an accident of birth?  Everyone covets what they don&rsquo;t have and putting myself in the place of a Black, it&rsquo;s not too difficult to figure out how I would feel if were Black.  With the civil rights movement of the 1960&rsquo;s behind us, and Blacks still not achieving, and committing crimes like no other group, Blacks still can&rsquo;t put the blame on themselves.  It&rsquo;s always the White man&rsquo;s fault for all their failings.</p>
