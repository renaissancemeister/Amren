			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brady McCombs, Arizona Daily Star (Tucson), January 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The landscape of saguaros, mesquite trees and prickly pear cactus here has a new feature  &mdash;  steel railroad rails welded into crisscrosses and connected by flat rails.</p>
<p>This rusting structure is a vehicle barrier designed to stop drug and people smugglers who barrel across the desert in trucks. The barriers are common at the international line  &mdash;  there are more than 139 miles of them along Arizona&rsquo;s stretch of U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t the border.</p>
<p>This 1.3-mile stretch of &#8220;Normandy-style&#8221; vehicle barriers was recently erected 70 miles north of the border on the Bureau of Land Management&rsquo;s Sonoran Desert Monument, just south of Interstate 8 and southwest of Casa Grande.</p>
<p>It is likely the first time border barriers have been used this far north, and the latest example of how managing public lands along the U.S.-Mexico border is now as much about dealing with trash and trails left behind by illegal border crossers as it is about monitoring endangered animals or watering holes.</p>
<p>BLM officials put up the barrier to redirect traffic around the federally protected Table Top Wilderness Area, where cars are prohibited. They know it won&rsquo;t stop drugs from reaching cities across the United States, but they couldn&rsquo;t sit back and watch the beautiful landscape get trampled.</p>
<p>Skinny, knee-high signs proclaim Table Top as protected wilderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;The public might respect our little signs, but they are not an issue for the smugglers,&#8221; said Damian Hayes, a BLM law enforcement ranger who patrols the area.</p>
<p>The barrier is on the southern boundary of Table Top, which borders the northern edge of the Tohono O&rsquo;odham Nation. Smugglers have carved a grid of illegal roads through the wilderness area as they cross the O&rsquo;odham land and cut through Table Top on their way toward Phoenix, inflicting serious damage to the habitat.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t unique to the Table Top Wilderness. From Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Southwestern Arizona to Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge southwest of Tucson to the multiple patches of Coronado National Forest across Arizona&rsquo;s border, land managers grapple with a multitude of issues related to being the busiest stretch of border for illegal immigration and drug smuggling. Including the Tohono O&rsquo;odham Nation, nearly 86 percent of the Arizona-Mexico borderlands are federal or tribal lands.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Federal law enforcement officers at the six border public lands visited by GAO officials this year said they spend 75 to 97 percent of their time responding to threats from illegal cross-border activity, the report found. At Organ Pipe, drug smugglers regularly use the visitor center parking lot as a staging area, says a Border Patrol threat assessment in the GAO report.</p>
<p>Keeping up with all the trash left behind keeps the BLM&rsquo;s Kathy Pedrick busy. Since 2002, the BLM has run an organized a trash-pickup program called the Southern Arizona Project. In fiscal 2009, the project picked up 234 tons of trash.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ll leave backpacks, food, whatever they want to jettison before a vehicle takes them,&#8221; said Pedrick, special assistant to the BLM state director and chairperson of the Borderland Management Task Force, a group of officials from federal agencies that meets every two months to discuss border issues.</p>
<p>The estimated 2,000 tons of trash left behind by smugglers and illegal immigrants has harmed the fragile Sonoran Desert, landing Buenos Aires, Organ Pipe and Cabeza Prieta on lists of most imperiled federal lands at different points this decade.</p>

		<p>I doubt we&rsquo;ll see the environmentalist movement get too worked up about 234 tons of trash.  This is the main reason these people have zero credibility in my eyes, all of their accomplishments the last 100 years notwithstanding.</p>
<p>BTW, I believe the Sierra Club was an outspoken critic of expansion and population growth in California until about the mid-60s, but have been conspicuously silent on the issue since.  I wonder why?<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but that makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>We cannot have a nation of parks and wilderness areas if we don&rsquo;t have a nation.  WHY are those barriers 70nm North of the international demarcator instead of _at the border_, where they should be?</p>
<p>What is not understood about the concept of a single line of optimized defensive fortifications being used to stop these people _short_ of dropping trash in our parks?</p>
<p>How much money will our government waste before they do the obvious and simply make it impossible for illegals to cross, period?</p>

		<p>This article does not convey in words what can be viewed by simply looking at the video &#8220;Trash on the border&#8221; on You Tube. I lived in southern AZ for many years. Not being raised there, it took a while to appreciate the stark yet delicate majesty of the Sonoran desert. I yearn to be back there and someday shall be. This defilement is as revolting a sight as any I can imagine. It causes me to regard in disgust any obviously illegal whom I encounter here in Atlanta. As one of your regular posters signs off, I repeat, &#8220;God help us all&#8221;. rich </p>

		<p>I just reviewed The Sierra Club&rsquo;s position on immigration.  They make no mention of illegal immigration.  They do say that their environmental concerns are not limited to the U.S. alone.  Some posters are making the mistake of assuming that The Sierra Club is a nationalist conservation group or ought to be.  All I found while reading their question and answer section is that yes, they are a traditionally liberal group with liberal values, and they are just as good as any political group in rationalizing their own positions in order to remain politically safe for the populations the typically support them.  Like Jews, I don&rsquo;t think that environmentalists will be turning to a white nationalist group for support very soon.</p>
<p>I think that it is too bad that being a white nationalist does not also make the typically declared love of country apply to our environment, just as I don&rsquo;t understand how being a social conservative automatically connotes support for the most exploitative, short-sighted, profit driven solutions for every issue that can be imagined.  When it comes to our land and its natural beauty and resources, liberals turn out to be the true conservatives.</p>

The liberal goal of open borders interferes with every other goal they have. A heterogeneous work force is more difficult to organize than a homogeneous one. The high rate of immigration is a major reason for the growing income gap.  </p>

		<p>You can be sure the Sierra Club will say nothing about this, since not being &#8220;racist&#8221; is far more important to that organization than protecting our wilderness or stabilizing our population.  That is why I left that organization.  Like most &#8220;environmentalists&#8221;, they&rsquo;re more red than green.<br>

<p>Just what is the cost to buy off the Sierra Club &mdash; once the most respected environmental organization in America? </p>
<p>A low nine figure sum does the job according to the Los Angeles Times in its story last fall about David Gelbaum, one of the key funders of the 112-year-old environmental organization. [&#8220;The Man Behind the Land&#8221; by Kenneth R. Weiss, Oct. 17, 2004]</p>
<p>A nice round $100 million was enough for Executive Director Carl Pope to toss the principles of honesty, democracy and conservation out the window. </p>
<p>Many of us involved in the grassroots effort to restore population sanity to the Sierra Club were suspicious that the mysterious $100 million in donations might have immigration strings attached. </p>
<p>After all, the 1996 switch from common sense to political correctness was an abrupt change from the earlier position that the Club should work to &#8220;bring about the stabilization of the population first of the United States and then of the world.&#8221; </p>
<p>Our suspicions were correct. The LA Times article revealed that shadowy funder Gelbaum donated generously on condition that the Sierra Club not address immigration as an environmental issue. </p>
<p>Said Gelbaum, &#8220;I did tell [Sierra Club Executive Director] Carl Pope in 1994 or 1995 that if they ever came out anti-immigration, they would never get a dollar from me.&#8221; </p>
