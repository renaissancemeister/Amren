			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Heidi Beirich, SPLC, January 4, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Wednesday, legislators from the anti-immigrant organization State Legislators for Legal Immigration (SLLI) will announce at the National Press Club their plan to halt what they call &#8220;the misapplication of the 14th Amendment.&#8221; The group seeks to end the amendment&rsquo;s provision of birthright citizenship, which assured that the children of slaves could not be denied citizenship, and ensures that almost all children born on U.S. soil are automatically granted American citizenship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SLLI is a coalition of about 70 legislators in 38 states dedicated to eliminating &#8220;economic attractions&#8221; for immigrants and their &#8220;unlawful invasion&#8221; of the U.S. SLLI leader Daryl Metcalf of Pennsylvania has a long history of making nasty anti-immigrant comments, including referring to undocumented immigrants as &#8220;foreign invaders&#8221; and their children as &#8220;anchor bab[ies].&#8221; In October, Metcalf announced a new SLLI task force to attack birthright citizenship. &#8220;This ongoing distortion and twisting of the 14th Amendment greatly incentivized foreign invaders to violate our border,&#8221; Metcalf said at an October press conference.</p>
<p>This harsh rhetoric isn&rsquo;t surprising given the relationship between Metcalf, SLLI and the anti-immigrant hate group, Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). SLLI is often described as the legislative arm of FAIR, which is apt given the group says on its website that it has a &#8220;working partnership&#8221; with FAIR. SLLI&rsquo;s legislators are the main instigators behind favored FAIR initiatives, including attempts at the state level to deny immigrants various rights through laws modeled on Arizona&rsquo;s S.B. 1070.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FAIR&rsquo;s designation as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center is well deserved. FAIR&rsquo;s founder and chief ideologue, John Tanton, has repeatedly questioned the &#8220;educability&#8221; of immigrants. He has corresponded with Holocaust deniers, former Klan lawyers and the leading white nationalist thinkers of the era. He introduced key FAIR leaders to the president of the Pioneer Fund, a white supremacist group set up to encourage &#8220;race betterment,&#8221; at a 1997 meeting at a private club.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FAIR&rsquo;s history of racism is far more extensive than described here. Prominent FAIR staffers have held membership or written for other hate groups, in particular the Council of Conservative Citizens, which has described African Americans as a &#8220;retrograde species of humanity.&#8221; The group has received funding from the neo-Nazi Pioneer Fund.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Apparently, FAIR&rsquo;s nasty track record of hate is of no bother to Metcalf or SLLI. Their press conference Wednesday will feature FAIR lawyers Kobach  &mdash;  who is the newly elected secretary of state of Kansas  &mdash;  and Michael Hethmon as speakers.<br>

		<p>In the SPLC&rsquo;s view, FAIR, probably the most PC of all the anti-immigration groups out there, is a &#8220;hate group&#8221; because its founder &#8220;corresponded&#8221; (i.e. e-mailed) &#8220;Holocaust deniers, former K lawyers and white nationalist thinkers.&#8221;  So you&rsquo;re a hater if your &#8220;links&#8221; to haters are as tenuous as e-mails.  But using that standard, the SPLC is a hate group under its own definition, because it interviews all those sorts of people.  Beirich and I have e-mailed each other from time to time   &mdash;   She was flattered that I (sarcastically) referred to her as a &#8220;sexy Donna Shalala look-alike,&#8221; and I suspect she was using that as an &#8220;in&#8221; to try and sweet talk me to fish for gossip about right wingers, of which I gave her none.</p>
<p>When she writes &#8220;former K lawyers,&#8221; she is referring to one person in particular.  I won&rsquo;t name him here, but the SPLC came this close to saying that he was actually in the K, when all he was was the defense lawyers for a few K members in some civil rights case.</p>

		<p>FAIR is a hate group?</p>
<p>Hahaha.  Too funny.  I&rsquo;m wondering if the SPLC included their dogs and other pets when they tallied up the number of people who work there in order to boost the false statistics they use in counting hate crime organizations.  100 FAIR employees amounts to 100 hate groups.  But if they count their pets it could well soar up to 150-200.</p>
<p>After all, every guy who wants to guard the border, his dog and computer all are in SPLC stats.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that any media organization would be so foolish as to quote these people on anything.</p>

		<p>A refresher course on the Southern Poverty Law Center: Laird Wilcox is an expert on fringe groups of both left and right.  Here Wilcox speaks to the methodology of the SPLC: </p>
<p>&ldquo;When you get right down to it, all the SPLC does is call people names. It&rsquo;s specialized a highly developed form of defamation however  &mdash;  a way of harming and isolating people by denying their humanity and trying to convert them into something that deserves to be hated and eliminated &hellip; They use their enormous resources to practice it on a mass scale &hellip; Anyone attacked by the SPLC is basically up against a contest of resources, from the ability to engage legal counsel, the access to fairness in media treatment, to the ability to survive the financial destruction of a reputation or a career. What they do is a kind of bullying and stalking &hellip; Their victims are usually ordinary people expressing their values, opinions, and beliefs and they are up against a very talented and articulate defamation machine.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The SPLC has managed to engage police and government agencies to assist them, interfacing informational resources about personal circumstances vulnerability, and opportunities for prosecution. The have even counseled the military in stigmatization and defamation procedures &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Americans really need to ask themselves if they are willing to tolerate this kind of operation in a free society &hellip; remember that sooner or later they might start looking at you or someone you love &hellip;&rdquo; (&ldquo;An Expert on Fringe Politcal Movements Reflects on the SPLC&rsquo;s Political Agenda,&rdquo; The Social Contract, Spring, 2010, pp188-189) <br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/33krthf" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/33krthf</a> </p>
<p>And from Wilcox&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Practice of Ritual Defamation,&rdquo; in the same issue of The Social Contract: </p>
<p>&ldquo;It (ritual defamation) is not used to persuade, but to punish &hellip; its thrust is primarily emotional. Ritual defamation is used to hurt, to intimidate, to destroy, and to persecute, and to avoid the dialogue, debate, and discussion upon which a free society depends. On those grounds it must be opposed no matter who tries to justify its use.&rdquo; (p191)<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/245rshx" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/245rshx</a> </p>
<p>On the stakes for freedom of speech: </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still involved in civil liberties and freedom of speech issues &hellip; I think these are the critical issues of our time, and to the extent that they&rsquo;re compromised we&rsquo;re all in trouble. As long as we can speak and write freely and discuss and debate openly, we can gradually work issues out. Extremists know this &hellip; that&rsquo;s why this kind of freedom is under attack.&rdquo;(p. 183) </p>

		<p>Actually, Heidi, it&rsquo;s not at all that FAIR doesn&rsquo;t bother Metcalf.  It&rsquo;s that Metcalf and many other people are no longer bothered by your accusations of hate.  You&rsquo;ve accused everybody and everything from boy scouts to mom&rsquo;s apple pie of being a hate group or hate speech.  Nobody cares anymore.  You&rsquo;ve marginalized your organization into irrelevance.  Finally.  It was only a matter of time.  Even the blacks pay you no attention anymore.  After all, when was the last time you actually put up the money to sue on behalf of a black (or anybody else for that matter)?  1970?  or so?  Now you merely sue  over an idea, or an organization not for the benefit of a complainant, but to fill YOUR coffers.  Here&rsquo;s a thought&hellip;..how about you withdraw those hundreds of millions from your off shore bank account and &#8220;redistribute&#8221; it to the needy and &#8220;oppressed&#8221;?  Never happen, will it?  If you love the illegal immigrants so much, how about you use those nearly billion bucks to build a welcome center complete with dining area, jobs programs, medical care, etc for the illegals in your home town.  NOT from donations.  From YOUR money kept off shore.  I&rsquo;m holding my breath.  Turning blue.  Passing out now.<br>

		<p>There is absolutely no reason for the children of illegals to be granted citizenship, unless the goal is to change the demographics of the country as fast as possible.  It&rsquo;s unbelievable that this law has been open for rampant abuse for decades without something being done to stop it.  It&rsquo;s telling that besides Canada no other first world country allows this absurd practice. </p>

		<p>This is a classic example of an association fallacy.</p>
<p><i>A</i> is guilty. <i>B</i> associates with <i>A.</i> Thus, <i>B</i> is wrong.</p>
<p>The $PLC is trying link this legislation with what they call a hate group as a means of trying to discredit the legislators.</p>

		<p>&#8220;foreign invaders&#8221; is accurate and so is &#8220;anchor babies&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s exactly what they are, thank you for clarifying that.</p>
<p>If we entered another country illegally, we&rsquo;d expect to be classified as foreign invaders and illegal aliens.</p>

		<p>I cannot think of a more despicable person than heidi bierich.</p>
<p>I have nothing but contempt for those who make it their life&rsquo;s work to destroy others&rsquo; reputations and careers through terror, threats and intimidation.</p>
<p>Bierich fancies herself as a Grand Inquisitor rooting out HATE   &mdash;   HATE being whatever she and the $PLC and say it is.  </p>
<p>The media, ever complicit, fawn all over the $PLC and give them  &#8220;almost religious reverence by the media, academia and government.&#8221;</p>
<p>One call from bierich to one&rsquo;s boss or place of business could be a death knell   &mdash;   or at least make one&rsquo;s life extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Ask Kevin Lamb:</p>
<p><i>One afternoon the Southern Poverty Law Center called my office supervisors to inquire about my work&hellip;To my bosses, the SPLC&rsquo;s heidi beirich was a faceless, nameless individual&hellip;Without hesitation or reservation, they accepted at face value her accusations and descriptions&hellip; I was given a few seconds to decide to either resign or be fired.</i></p>
<p>Or Professor Kevin MacDonald:</p>
<p><i>Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center is interviewing some 40 students, faculty, and administrators&hellip; where I am a tenured Professor of Psychology, for an upcoming hit job on me and my research&hellip;In April, 2008, Beirich returned to CSULB to lead a meeting in which she again denounced me.</i></p>
<p>Or Jared Taylor:</p>
<p><i>Beirich succeeded with another phone call in frightening the supposedly-conservative Leadership Institute into a last-minute refusal of its premises to the Robert A. Taft Club, which planned to hold a&hellip;between American Renaissance&rsquo;s Jared Taylor, National Review&rsquo;s John Derbyshire and black conservative Kevin Martin.  </i></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the entire sordid story, including e mail exchanges between Dr. MacDonald and ms. bierich:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/27aqg4u" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/27aqg4u</a></p>
<p>She seems to take particular delight in attacking and destroying White males with trumped-up charges of racism and White supremacism.</p>
<p>And you, as a White male, what recourse do you have against the likes of bierich, marc botox or morris sleeze, after being accused of HATE and RACISM?</p>
<p>A hot place in **** should be reserved for those who practice and take joy in the art of personal destruction.</p>

		<p>Why does anybody care what the SPLC says? To anyone who has paid attention to their antics in the last three decades, they should have lost all credibility. They spout blatant falsehoods on a regular basis. I dearly hope that one day they slip up and say something that&rsquo;s not carefully worded enough to avoid a libel suit, and that it&rsquo;s directed against someone with the resources and the will to sue their organization into oblivion.</p>
