			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Schneider, AOL News, January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Shortly before 4 a.m. on Feb. 7, 1986, Jean-Claude &#8220;Baby Doc&#8221; Duvalier, his gorgeous and glitzy wife Michele Bennet, their two young children, at least one mistress and about 20 close friends and servants got aboard a huge U.S. Air Force jet and headed for France.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Baby Doc and his father before him had plundered and terrorized the island nation for decades. Now the Haitian people were robbed again by their last &#8220;president for life.&#8221; They awoke to music and taped messages from Duvalier on radio stations in Port-au-Prince, saying he had left for the good of the country.</p>
<p>By mid-morning, some at the U.S. Embassy were failing to conceal their anger at their country&rsquo;s involvement in facilitating the departure, {snip}.</p>
<p>The rationale quietly shared with the few foreign reporters who remained in the country was that &#8220;he promised to never come back. Never.&#8221; And &#8220;Haiti will be better off without any Duvaliers.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Duvalier was appointed president at age 19 under a provision in the Haitian constitution that allowed his father, Francois &#8220;Papa Doc&#8221; Duvalier, to name Baby Doc the next president for life. The ruthless senior dictator died in 1971.</p>
<p>The brutal oppression inflicted on his subjects by Jean-Claude&rsquo;s secret police, the pilfering of the treasury as tens of thousands starved and the anticipated international charges of human rights violations led to rare popular protests and prompted him to plan his departure, U.S. Embassy officials said at the time.</p>
<p>As word of his escape spread, emotions in the capital exploded. In Cite Soleil, a seaside, tin-roofed, shantytown of open sewers, and Warf Jeremie and other packed slums, the impoverished raced through the streets cursing the Duvaliers, who had killed and imprisoned so many.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Papa Doc&rsquo;s crypt in the city&rsquo;s central cemetery  &mdash;  above ground like the others because of the high water table  &mdash;  was destroyed bit by bit, by scores of sweating men and women hammering away with hand tools, until the marble and granite shattered and the bones within were removed.</p>
<p>The Tonton Macoute  &mdash;  the Duvalier family&rsquo;s 5,000-man militia, enforcers, collector of bribes and kickbacks, torturers, assassins and stiflers of all dissent  &mdash;  were prize targets if they could be found. Throughout the city, pieces of their uniforms and their iconic, fear-inducing, silver-mirrored sunglasses could be found tossed in alleys and trashcans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two days after Duvalier fled, on a road about 22 miles from Port-au-Prince, a taxi carrying a foreign journalist was surrounded by 40 or 50 people, laughing, cheering and screaming, banging on the vehicle, urging the American to follow them up the hill.</p>
<p>Ten or 15 feet below the top of the small knoll, a rivulet of red flowed downward through the dust. At the top, a frail-looking, gray-haired woman held a bloodied machete in one hand and the head of a man in the other.</p>
<p>A young man wearing a Tulane University T-shirt told the reporter not to &#8220;think harshly&#8221; of the woman. He explained that the man whose head she held  &mdash;  the local Tonton Macoute  &mdash;  had raped both her daughter and granddaughter and killed one of her grandsons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the hilltop enclaves overlooking the capital, hunkered down within the high-walled, bougainvillea-covered estates and hidden from view behind their private guard forces, the wealthy in Petionville and Juvenat worried about their future without a Duvalier.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pry bars were used to force open huge freezers and pantries. Chicken, lobster, shrimp, sausages, beef, pork, mushrooms, exotic vegetables and spices  &mdash;  all flown in from the U.S. or Europe  &mdash;  were tossed into more than a dozen 20-gallon cook pots set atop portable gas burners. Rice and beans boiled away in other pots. Chefs who normally competed for elite clientele worked side by side outside the mansion to concoct a stew of the kind the slum dwellers had never eaten.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, almost a quarter of a century later, Duvalier is back, at least for a few days, and the journalists are again rushing to the island. <br/>

		<p>Nowhere is the saying more true than in Haiti that &#8220;people generally get the type of rulers they deserve.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ever since the Haitians committed a form of genocide a couple of centuries ago and murdered all the whites in their miserable country, Haiti has been ruled by a succession of dictators and despots. We&rsquo;re supposed to forget about Haiti&rsquo;s bloody past while being constantly reminded of slavery in our own.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t we (the U.S.) still have Manuel Noriega in custody? I think we bring him out sometimes and dangle him in front of the Panamanians and threaten to reinstall him in power if they get out of line. I also believe Ferdinand Marcos is in the witness protection program along with John Gotti and others, probably living the high life like the Ouighar muslims the Chinese kicked out and we support. We simply cannot let a good crisis go to waste lol.</p>

		<p>The bands of slaves slaughtered every white person they encountered. As their standard, they carried a pike with the carcass of an impaled white baby. NEVER FORGET</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t see a problem here. If these africans want this voodoo dictator to rule them again, then so be it.  Of course, it would be wise to curtail all foreign cash aid and insist that reconstruction is carried out by the ample unemployed local labour and funded by Papa Doc Duvalier himself. If this were made very clear to the general population, perhaps it would jolt some sense into them although very few will remember the activities of the tonton macoute (haitian creole meaning &#8216;bogeymen&rsquo;) and how they kept law and order. Once papa doc realises there is no aid money to loot, he will probably lose interest and leave the presidential race to the rap singer contestant.</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t care whether Baby Doc returns to Haiti or not. Our own attempts to fix their problems for them have come to absolutely naught. Let&rsquo;s get our people out of there and leave them alone.</p>

		<p>If only there hadn&rsquo;t been African slavery. Haiti could have been a wonderful little slice of tropical France, if only the French had just colonized it like Quebec with their own people instead of that greedy and stupid plantation-agricultural system. It was a disaster for everyone.</p>
