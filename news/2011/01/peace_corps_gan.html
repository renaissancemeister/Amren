			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Schecter and Brian Ross, ABC News, January 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 1,000 young American women have been raped or sexually assaulted in the last decade while serving as Peace Corps volunteers in foreign countries, an ABC News 20/20 investigation has found.</p>
<p>In some cases, victims say, the Peace Corps has ignored safety concerns and later tried to blame the women who were raped for bringing on the attacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She is one of six rape and sexual assault victims who agreed to tell their stories, in hopes the Peace Corps will do a better job of volunteer training and victim counseling. The report will be broadcast Friday night on 20/20.</p>
<p>In the most brutal attack, Jess Smochek, 29, of Pennsylvania was gang raped in Bangladesh in 2004 by a group of young men after she says Peace Corps officials in the country ignored her pleas to re-locate her.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Smochek says the group began to stalk her and tried to kiss her and touch her from the very first day she arrived at the city where she was assigned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day we felt unsafe. And we reported everything, we just kept reporting,&#8221; she said in an interview with five other former volunteers who also were rape or sexual assault victims.</p>
<p>She says the gang rape took place just hours after a Peace Corps safety official filed a report with the local police but again ignored her pleas for re-assignment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She says the Peace Corps immediately began to cover up what happened to her, fearful, she says, of offending officials in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the decision was made that I was to go to Washington, D.C., I was told to tell volunteers that I was having my wisdom teeth out,&#8221; Smochek says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2009, Peace Corps figures show there were 221 rapes or attempted rapes, 147 major sexual attacks and 719 other sexual assaults_defined as unwanted or forced kissing, fondling or groping.</p>
<p>According to the figures, there is a yearly average of 22 rapes. There were 15 in the year for which the figures are most recently available, 2009</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some victims say the Peace Corps has continued to treat them in an insensitive way.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&rsquo;t a point person or an advocate or someone who is managing the case,&#8221; said Casey Frazee of Cincinnati, Ohio who was sexually assaulted in South Africa in 2009. She has established a support group and website for other Peace Corps victims, First Response Action.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one is really looking at this because there&rsquo;s this over-idealized picture of the JFK Peace Corps,&#8221; said Frazee.</p>
<p>Maggie Young of New Mexico says she decided to tell the story of her rape in South Africa in 2008 because she feels more should be known about the problem.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the case of the gang rape victim, Jess Smochek, she says she was made to feel the attack was her fault because she had been walking alone shortly after 5 p.m.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to list all the things that I had done wrong to cause this to happen to me,&#8221; she says her counselor told her.</p>
<p>Other women said they were told that by having a drink or two they had invited the attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a risky person, and that I had in some way put myself in that situation,&#8221; said Adrianna Ault Nolan, who was raped in 1998 but says she still carries the mental scars of the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still blame myself,&#8221; says Christina Holsomback of Alabama, who was raped in the country of Georgia in 2008. &#8220;Maybe I should not have had a drink or maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t have gone to dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>No Christina, you just did what the Media tells you since years: Treating different people different is racist!<br>
You treated them like you treat Europeans. That was the mistake and will ever be.</p>

		<p>Surely the Peace Corps doesn&rsquo;t simply drop these women alone into shark infested waters&hellip;</p>
<p>Where are the male volunteers?<br>
Do they ever attempt to intercede or protect the women?</p>
<p>Are they all so whipped by feminist ideology that they remain aloof?<br>
Would a showdown between the male staff and the local good ole boys engender an out of proportion reaction in the courts thereby negating a heroic response?</p>
<p>Does an Amy Biehl Syndrome put these gals at risk?</p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t need to go to a foreign country to make a differeance or to get raped. Just send them to Detroit, New Orleans or anywhere in the US there is a large black concentration.</p>

<p>This sounds like date rape.  Probably explains most of these statistics.</p>

		<p>How about volunteering to help out whites in places like Appalachia or other similar spots? That never seems to enter the minds of all these do-gooders; they always seem to prefer those adorable third worlders, yet nothing ever changes much over there. I question the actual purpose of this program. What expertise and experience can a 23 year old actually provide to people living in these countries? The Peace Corp should not post naive young people to these places. Also, the countries named in the article have enough in-country expertise to draw on to help the locals, that is, if they really cared enough to do so.</p>

<p>None of which will be at all surprising to anyone on this site.  The <i>real</i> question is how these unfortunate (White) women <i>now</i> view Holy Diversity.  I&rsquo;d wager that most of them have ostentatiously &#8220;forgiven&#8221; their attackers, and found some tortuous rationale to blame their assailants&rsquo; vicious predation on Evil White Racism.</p>
<p>How much starry-eyed governmedia antiWhite propaganda was required to blind these young women to the danger in which they were putting themselves?  Surely they saw themselves as stepping nobly into a Coke commercial, holding hands with friendly, smiling nonWhites and singing songs of joy and unity in sunny fields strewn with daffodils.  </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I still blame myself,&rdquo; says Christina Holsomback of Alabama, who was raped in the country of Georgia in 2008. &ldquo;Maybe I should not have had a drink or maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t have gone to dinner.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Or maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t have exposed yourself to nonWhite savagery in the first place, Christina.  But I guess blaming yourself for being victimized is <i>ever</i> so much better than being called a Racist.  Isn&rsquo;t it?<br>

		<p>&ldquo;I was a risky person, and that I had in some way put myself in that situation,&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
That statement is essentially true&hellip;.but not for the reasons presented.  She was at risk because of her communist ideology.  Her anti-white hatred and racism fueled her desire to help evil non-whites instead of virtuous needful whites in her own country.  She dismissed all evidence that non-whites are evil, and ignored being immersed in the fact that they are evil until she became a victim.  She continues to dismiss the truth that non-whites are evil, caring nothing that doing this will cause others to suffer the same fate or worse.  What matters to her is maintaining her hatred of her own kind by insisting that non-whites are just like us, only now, with exceptions.  She literally feels a need to elevate non-whites because she hates and wants to diminish whites.</p>
<p>And she cares nothing for those suffering whites she could have helped had she chosen differently.</p>
<p>An organization like the peace corps should not have ANY volunteers.  People should avoid it like the plague and demand it be defunded.  There is actually a move among the tea party to defund ALL foreign aid&hellip;.but no mention as to why, beyond the cost.</p>
<p>My point is, on the surface, these are liberals taking advantage of the idealism and good heartedness of naive whites.  But underneath, what fuels this behavior is contempt, loathing and racist hate&hellip;..for whites.  And it bore bitter fruit for this woman.  And she refuses to admit how her own behavior caused it.</p>

		<p>This is what comes of idealism and idealistic young women in a society that celebrates personal freedom to the extent that our young women persist in striking out on altruistic adventures, only to wind up victims of cultures with &#8220;different&#8221; values and less &#8220;enlightened&#8221; practices when it comes to how we tolerate skimpy clothing, and forwardness as a habit.  Feminism has cowed Western men to the point that we fear to even look toward a woman as she saunters by in her revealed clevage, high skirt, or skin tight jeans.  We make and send movies all over the world wherein women depict themselves as loose and easy, certainly not respectfully.  So off march some liberal young women to &#8220;change the world.&#8221;  I am not at all surprised that so many have terrible experiences like this.  I am also not surprised that The Peace Corps wants to keep it quiet.  No one really cares what happens to anyone unless it threatens their little situation.</p>
<p>I am sorry for these young women.  I hope that they will speak up and address the issue of cross cultural interpretation when considering joining up or traveling alone anywhere.  But one big hint; Non-Western men are going to take every advantage you present, and they are already excited from media representations of American women.</p>

		<p>These tragedies are the end result of what I and others call the &#8220;Amy Biehl Syndrone&#8221; after the young White woman who traveled to South Africa to &#8220;fight Apartheid oppression of blacks&#8221; and was ironically murdered by an angry mob of racist blacks simply because she was White.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Biehl" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Biehl</a></p>
<p>These young White females (and males) are invariably people from sheltered, upper middle-class homes who have been inculcated by neo-Marxist college professors into believing all the problems of the Third World are Whitey&rsquo;s fault and more importantly&hellip;they can make a difference!</p>
<p>Incredibly, Ms. Biehl&rsquo;s parents not only &#8216;forgave&rsquo; her murderers, they shook hands with them!  Such are the deleterious effects of a leftist education.</p>
<p>We need to purge the insane bioegalitarian doctrines of the Left from our schools and replace them with Eugenics 101.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never read of a simple thank you or show of gratitude by  countries wherein the Peace Corps has worked. </p>
<p>Too, I can&rsquo;t see where the Peace Corps has fulfilled their purpose of making America better liked around the world and winning anybody over via a cultural exchange.  In fact, there&rsquo;s more hatred against the US now than ever. And so far as exchanging cultural knowledge goes, that&rsquo;s absolutely useless.</p>
<p>These third world hell holes care about nothing but being recipients of freebies.  The Peace Corps should be declared null and void.</p>

		<p>White women have some kind of underdog gene that makes them very gullible.  Not all, but many.  I gave up on them decades ago, they will generally melt at the sight of a black man&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
disgusting.  and it has severe ramifications for all whites.<br>

		<p>To this day I am utterly and completely amazed at the lack of basic common sense shown by young women, white women in particular.  I have seen so many white girls putting themselves in such terrible situtations.  </p>
<p>I work around a ton of young adult women, early 20s and all that.  They constantly talk about how they go to the bars and stuff at night looking for black and latino men. (This is a big mostly non-white urban area and many white girls here go crazy for their dark and milk chocolate studs.)  Then at other times they complain that they&rsquo;ve been stalked, followed and harrassed.  A latina girl just complained to us the other day about some guy trying to force his way into her apt.</p>
<p>I knew a girl last year, a pretty young blond from like Maine or somewhere, who decided to go off to Uganda to teach the helpless villagers how to get water, store grain and brush their teeth.  After all the violence there, I was like, Whoa, are you nuts?  Off she went!  </p>
<p>I am sorry but the patriarchy, for all its faults, protected young girls.</p>

		<p>Their website says: </p>
<p>&#8220;Since 1961, the Peace Corps has shared with the world America&rsquo;s most precious resource – its people.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is hardly any need for the Peace Corps these days. Even the most backward countries have elites who have access to modern knowledge and education.  </p>
<p>The Peace Corps volunteers are doing the jobs the locals don&rsquo;t want to do. They&rsquo;re perpetuating the myth that whites have it so easy, they send their children abroad to work for brown people. </p>

		<p>The Peace Corp.  Chock full of DWL&rsquo;s who have no clue as to what the third world is really like.  And if anybody tried to warn them, those same DWL women (predominantly) and men would call that person bigoted, narrow minded, and racist.  These Peace Corp volunteers are of the same misguided mindset as those who think more money, more compassion, more computers, more ethnic history studies, whatever will suddenly make uncaring, hostile black  thugs in inner city schools into violin virtuoso&rsquo;s or rocket scientists.  Hasn&rsquo;t for 50 years, and the Peace Corp likewise has not altered one whit the reality of the third world and especially Africa.  </p>

		<p>Any Peace Corp. official should know that there are a minimum of 150,000 rape cases reported in South Africa every year.  The number of unreported cases is unknown but estimated to be close to those that are reported. Many other 3rd world countries will have similar statistics whether published or not</p>
<p>These female aid workers are still posted to countries like this!<br>
Either the Peace Corp is totally uncaring &amp; naive.  Females should not be out there unless they are prepared to be molested.</p>
<p>These folk must realise that they are dealing with a different culture with very different values.</p>
<p>As for the Peace Corp being fearful of reporting the rapes to Bangladeshi authorities smacks of  weakness.  After all they&rsquo;re there to assist, at no cost to the government. Get security for their staff or pull the aid staff out altogether &amp; let them aid their own people. Is that not what governments are for.<br>
These 3rd world governments always seem to have funds for weapons, nuclear research or space exploration programmes.   <br>
What about their own population getting a bit of attention.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t speak to the specifics of this story, but I can attest to my experience and observations as a male Peace Corps volunteer in Central America in the late seventies.</p>
<p>The Country Directors and Assistant Directors most definitely had a &#8220;blame the volunteer&#8221; bias when any uncomfortable scenarios between PCVs and host country locals presented  themselves. Country Directors were political climbers who enjoyed diplomatic immunity (and in many cases needed that immunity to cover for their own misbehaviors) and a wide swath of discretion in dealing with situations and &#8220;interpreting&#8221; the rules. Women PCVs among my colleagues ranged from reprobate sluts to just regular girls. There were sex scandals (consensual and forcible)involving all classes of PCV women. The males involved were either host country locals or Peace Corps bosses (both US and host country nationals)</p>

		<p>I know it&rsquo;s wrong, but I just can&rsquo;t quit smiling. I&rsquo;ve met a few former Peace Corps volunteers and every one of them lectured me for not being more understanding about the needs of the underprivileged of the world.</p>
<p>There are now 1,000 do-gooder bleeding heart liberal women who have a thorough understanding of the needs of some of those poor underprivileged souls and I think that is a real good start.</p>

		<p>I know it&rsquo;s wrong, but I just can&rsquo;t quit smiling. I&rsquo;ve met a few former Peace Corps volunteers and every one of them lectured me for not being more understanding about the needs of the underprivileged of the world.  - MLK</p>
<p>I think they deserved it.  I really do.  They are not only naive but bring the invasion to our shores.  They deserve to be punished.</p>

		<p>A message, if I may, to the silly idealistic (or is that just silly?) young women of not only the USA, but the entire Western world, do not join the Peace Corps!<br>
I wonder whether any of these young women have learnt anything from their nauseating third world experience? If they have, they should be discouraging their younger &#8216;sisters&rsquo; from joining this ridiculous organisation that not only puts their own volunteers at risk, but also attempts to cover up the &#8216;bad stuff.&rsquo;<br>
I could go on, but I&rsquo;ll leave it here.</p>

		<p>The Peace Corps is a Kennedy-era relic that should go the way of the nuclear bomb drills in elementary school, the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Office of Economic Opportunity. It was cobbled together by the Kennedy regime as a counter to the Soviet Cold War threat; a way of saying &#8220;Americans aren&rsquo;t bad&#8221;, to impressionable third-world nations. After all, the Peace Corps came on the heels of the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the Berlin Wall. It was also a time when many Third World nations - mostly in sub-Sahara Africa -were gaining independence. The foundation was laid by Kennedy in his &#8220;ask what you can do for your country&#8221; inaugural address.</p>
<p>In young, white naive college students, Kennedy found the perfect foil. He knew that American Bantus and mestizos would balk at being sent to Third World outposts to try to improve the lives of locals there, when they were fighting for their civil rights, stateside. To this day, the number of non-white Peace Corps volunteers is pitifully low.</p>
<p>A Peace Corps &#8220;volunteer&#8221; is in a catch-22 situation. They go to a foreign country unarmed, and they&rsquo;re at the mercy of the locals. If they (somehow) were issued arms for self-defense, they&rsquo;d be seen as an &#8220;occupying force&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think that not enough information about these countries is being given to Peace Corps do-gooders. If volunteers were shown the crime statistics in places like Haiti and the new South Africa, would they even go?</p>
<p>The best thing would be to disband the Peace Corps, entirely. It&rsquo;s not worth it, putting Americans at risk. Let these countries build themselves up.  </p>

		<p>A few random thoughts here&hellip;</p>
<p>The peace corps was created in the 1960&rsquo;s. It is a product of that time, naive and idealistic. It was no accident it was a 1960&rsquo;s thing. The fatal immigration act was enacted just four years later. It too was somehow seen as being connected to the whole civil rights struggle and making America better, kinder and more equal. What a disaster that whole decade really was. The best thing now would be to dissolve the peace corps. Put this Kennedy era dinosaur to rest.</p>
<p>The true number of rapes is likely much higher. How many young women were too humiliated to come forward? Or thought they had no legal recourse? I would double or triple the reported rate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot of sympathy for these women, although this seem cold. They are undoubtedly part of the marxist, college-crowd of liberal whites who &#8220;know better&#8221; then readers of AmRen. They pretty much all have a case of Amy Biehl syndrome to me.</p>
<p>If I were to blame anyone, it would be the parents and families. They should not have allowed their daughters to be placed in harms way. They should have made them racially aware. But then again think of the Biehl&rsquo;s and how they reacted to their daughter&rsquo;s killers.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Any Peace Corp. official should know that there are a minimum of 150,000 rape cases reported in South Africa every year. The number of unreported cases is unknown but estimated to be close to those that are reported. Many other 3rd world countries will have similar statistics whether published or not.&#8221;<br>
and<br>
&#8220;If volunteers were shown the crime statistics in places like Haiti and the new South Africa, would they even go?&#8221;</p>
<p>It probably has a lot to do with their parents-Look how Amy Biehl&rsquo;s parents shook the hands of those who killed their daughter and were glad when South Africa let them go free. These are probably the children of the same parents who encourage their kids to sign up for third world missionary trips to Haiti and similar places. </p>
<p>But, the responsibility ultimately lies with the girls-They are all adults and have the ability to make their own decisions and do their own research. Trying to dissuade them from venturing to one of these countries might make them even for it even more. Sadly, it is probably the result of either low IQs or not putting their white IQs to good use by reading up a little on crime statistics (or even looking at US travel guidelines about safety, which state clearly that some of these places are dangerous.) </p>

  Similarly the rights of women were always strictly constrained in terms of franchise, bearing witness etc, only today&rsquo;s western nations are exceptional in this regard.Also, in just about every sciety ever studied girls were married off as soon as possible to anyone who would take them off their parent&rsquo;s hands, and were generally never seen again.<br>

<p>Actually I&rsquo;ll take you up since you&rsquo;re wrong on so many levels.</p>
<p>It is true that in certain countries like India and China male offspring are preferred but such isn&rsquo;t the case, especially in Western countries. Think about it, if what you said was true that males were preferred throughout history and the world the population wouldn&rsquo;t be like it today. For places like China (Same with India) that had to be only a recent development because it is one of the most populated regions in the world. They say &#8220;it takes two to tango.&#8221; More females and less males are need for population growth, from a Social Darwinist standpoint, not the other way around.</p>
<p>The view that &#8220;rights of women&#8221; were constrained can only view objectively view from biased context. Men did more and got more rights. Some of these rights have a double edged sword. For example from Feminist context women do not have the right to work in many fields in the past. What it doesn&rsquo;t take into account is the stress and responsibility of the man to care for the entire family unit. In fact when you look at suicide or higher death rate men come out top 3 to 4 more likely.</p>
<p>Back then the belief was that men and women were biologically different thus deserve different rights. The belief, can arguably at lest in part, has to do with survival. </p>
<p>To Feminist if a woman isn&rsquo;t treated like/equal to a man, she is inferior. That can only be asserted on the belief that men and women are innately the same. Thus, it is up to &#8220;us&#8221; to bring men and women BACK to the original state of equality, because equality means less conflict (all of this stems from many ideologies like Marxism, Egalitarianism, etc, which isn&rsquo;t bad, but the ideology has its flaws).</p>
<p>Really? I didn&rsquo;t see any Feminist fighting for their right to stay left behind on the ship. What was stopping them? What stopping these women from saying, &#8220;Oh no no Bob. That is clearly sexism. Let me die instead.&#8221; Sounds like a privileged group.</p>
<p>Yes, women are weaker in terms of physically (that is just part of science and biology). The fairer comes from the idea that women are the backbone of the society. &#8220;Mother nature.&#8221; A society future depending on its women, because the women ensure the future survival.</p>
<p>Simply put, anyone who says women were more oppressed throughout history doesn&rsquo;t clearly know about history. What place,era do you want to talk about. You can choose another place to debate.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Surely the Peace Corps doesn&rsquo;t simply drop these women alone into shark infested waters&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes the Peace Corps does.  50 years ago when it first started the women were given multiculture classes and told the facts about latin American, Arab, African etc men.  But the women protested that it was all just evil white male supremacy falsehoods about third world males so the classes were stopped.</p>
<p>The feminazis were active in discouraging the Peace Corps from training the women about the realities of third world life as well.  Feminazis claim to be anti rape, but they would throw evey<br>
White woman on the planet to third world men to achieve thier objective of eradicating the White race.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What expertise and experience can a 23 year old actually provide to people living in these countries?&#8221;</p>
<p>So very true!! I was around when Kennedy started it.  I have always wondered what a liberal arts graduate from a third generation White collar family whose Father probably didn&rsquo;t know a hammer from a screw driver could do in some stone age village where the &#8220;primitive&#8221; locals know how to build their own houses, wells etc.</p>
<p>As more and more wealthy liberal families employ third world immigrants as maids, gardeners, handymen around the house rich liberals lose even more useful skills.  Do these women even know how to sew on a button any more? </p>

		<p>No, Ben.<br>
If you care to look up the literature, female infanticide was very widely practised in hisory and pre-history.In societies that didn&rsquo;t have birth control excess children were simply &#8216;culled&rsquo; and girls were almost always culled instead of boys as they were deemed less valuable.<br>
  This certainly occurred in China as recently as the 1930s and 40s, some journalists claim it happened right into the 1990s.<br>
   The Koran (written in the 600s AD) contains an admonition agaist female infanticide.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true that in certain countries like India and China male offspring are preferred but such isn&rsquo;t the case, especially in Western countries&hellip;For places like China (Same with India) that had to be only a recent development because it is one of the most populated regions in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are way off base, Ben!  Andrew Neather was essentially correct, but I&rsquo;ll go even further.</p>
<p>Cold-blooded as it might be for some to hear, infanticide (acts of criminality notwithstanding) historically occured to insure conservation of familial resources.  Simply put, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to feed 3-4 children than 5, 6 or more.</p>
<p>Female infanticide is the natural result of the Neolithic Revolution (c. 8,000-5,000 BC).  For many centuries after the Neolithic period, the bulk of humanity made their living agriculturally.  </p>
<p>Feminist nonsense aside, males are on average significantly superior to females in terms of both upper and lower body strength as well as endurance.  </p>
<p>http://www.narth.com/docs/york.html</p>
<p>Male children could also be depended upon to care for elderly parents, while females presumably would marry off and vanish from the ranks of the family.  Finally, many ancient (and even some modern) societies require brides to bring a burdensome dowry with them to the marriage.  Thus, if a farmer was forced by circumstances to choose between allowing a male or female child to survive, it was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>This stark reality about innate male-female differences fostered a dark but nonetheless essential practice that was so widespread and lasted so long it eventually evolved into an almost universal cultural norm (at least among Eurasian peoples).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-privatelife249.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-privatelife249.shtml</a></p>
<p><a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26755692/ns/today-tech_and_science" rel="nofollow">http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26755692/ns/today-tech_and_science</a></p>
<p>http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/femaleinfanticide.html</p>
<p>This would go a long way in explaining why the practice continued even among the affluent members of more civilized societies.  It would also explain why it continues in many places to this day, in spite of the fact the need for it in most cases has vanished.</p>
<p>Years ago I read an article in an anthropology textbook where the author stated a healthy human society is one where there&rsquo;s a slight surplus female population (due to naturally higher mortality rates among males).  Given the significant surplus male populations of places like China, India and many Islamic countries, it&rsquo;s a safe bet to say those societies are anything but &#8216;healthy&rsquo;.   </p>
