			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Howard Blume, Los Angeles Times, January 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the e-mail, sent Monday, Chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau [of UC Berkeley] condemned a &#8220;climate in which demonization of others goes unchallenged and hateful speech is tolerated.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued, {snip} &#8220;I believe that it is not a coincidence that this calamity has occurred in a state which has legislated discrimination against undocumented persons.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A leader of the Philadelphia-based Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties group, also criticized the chancellor&rsquo;s remarks. &#8220;The supposition that political expression created a climate that led Loughner to his choice is an idea that seems to have sprung from whole cloth out of the minds of people who likely were upset beforehand about &#8216;rhetoric&rsquo; and &#8216;hateful&rsquo; speech, including, apparently, Chancellor Birgeneau,&#8221; Adam Kissel wrote.</p>
<p>Diane Schrader, on the NewsReal Blog of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, accused Birgeneau of delivering &#8220;a nasty political rant even while condemning  &mdash;  you guessed it  &mdash;  nasty political rants!&#8221;</p>
<p>Birgeneau also commented in his e-mail on the recent failure in Congress of the DREAM Act, which would have created a path to citizenship for children of some illegal immigrants. &#8220;This same mean-spirited xenophobia played a major role in the defeat of the DREAM Act by legislators in Washington, leaving many exceptionally talented and deserving young people, including our own undocumented students, painfully in limbo with regard to their futures in this country,&#8221; the chancellor wrote.</p>

		<p>What is this clown so worried about?  He&rsquo;s in California, and the new state administration of Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris are going to essentially legalize illegal aliens anyway, while the Feds look the other way.</p>
<p>Then again, he&rsquo;s the Chancellor at Berkeley, an institution that depends on an increasingly emaciated California state budget.  A dollar the state spends on Hispanic welfare benefits isn&rsquo;t spent at Berkeley.</p>

		<p>I am glad you put this up. This is another example of in-your-face treason. For 500 thousand dollars a year-his salary-Robert Birgeneau is willing to commit race treason against his own kind:Native Born White American-working class variety.</p>
<p>Robert Birgeneau is asserting the greedy cheating class lie that without  the asians and mexcian invaders colonizing California-and other states- America would never be able to meets its high tech labor needs. Birgeneau can assert this all he wants..but it is manifestly a bold face lie.</p>
<p>Robert Birgeneau-for 500 thousand dollars a year-is hell bent- on racially cleansing Native Born White Americans-the racial group that paid for and built the California State University System- out of the California Sate University and replacing them with post-1965 nonwhites from Pakistan,Iran-one million in California-India,Korea,China and Mexico. He is a sociopathic traitor.</p>
<p>When America was 90 percent White, it was able to out 12 alpha Native Born White American Males on the  moon. </p>
<p>How did Native Born White America manage when there were hardly any Mexicans,Iranians,Pakistanis,Koreans and Chinese in California? Very Well thank you.</p>
<p>There is not a snowballs chance in hell that China,India,Iran,Pakistan and Korea would race-replacement their youth population in their respective university systems with European and American foreigners.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a very serious ecological dimension to Robert Birgeneau&rsquo;s race treason. His enthusiasm for open borders and high fertility post 1965 nonwhites will lead-with 100 percent certainty- to the ecological collapse of California. A combination of large numbers of post-1965 nonwhites, their high fertility and their offfspring&rsquo;s high fertility will cause the California human population to explode. Hundreds of California&rsquo;s endemic speceies are already highly endangered. And on top of that, California is a water scarce state relative to its population size and the future expansion of the state&rsquo;s population. Southern California imports its water-hundreds of miles-from the Whiter Western states. Obviously, the policy of race-replacing Native Born White American youth in the California State University System goes hand-in hand with the ecological destruction of California.</p>
<p>Treason is the reason. There is no economic,cultural,ecological and demographic reason for race-replacing Native Born White American youth in the California State University system with high fertility post-1965 nonwhites.</p>

		<p>Yes, I am familiar with Berkeley staff and their anti-white attitude. No matter what happens, everything is always whitey&rsquo;s fault. If it&rsquo;s good than it is the result of diversity, if it is bad, it is the result of the whites. He does everything he can to prevent any pure whites, especially males, from attending Berkeley. I attend a community college near Berkeley, and you would not believe the illiterate foreign trash they let into that school at the expense of native Californian citizens. Citizens whose parents pay taxes that fund the California University system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This same mean-spirited xenophobia played a major role in the defeat of the DREAM Act by legislators in Washington, leaving many exceptionally talented and deserving young people&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Exceptionally talented at WHAT, exactly? Rolling a burrito? Loading a washing machine? Pushing a lawnmower? </p>
<p>Do all the hispandering you want, Chancellor Birgenau. But at the end of the day the average Mexifornia mestizo has no more affection for a bleeding-heart liberal like you than he has for a <i>gringo malo</i> like me. </p>
<p>Trust me, Chancellor. Your brown-skinned buddies don&rsquo;t like your pale, pinkish complexion. They don&rsquo;t like your snowy white hair. They don&rsquo;t like your tailored suit. They don&rsquo;t like your cultivated voice. They don&rsquo;t like when you use long English words that they don&rsquo;t know. </p>
<p>And more important than not liking you, Chancellor, they also don&rsquo;t RESPECT you. NOBODY respects the kind of public self-flagellation you&rsquo;re indulging in. It&rsquo;s unseemly. Unmanly. I&rsquo;m embarrassed for you. Your racial self-abatement is excessive even by Berkeley standards. </p>
<p>Because, Chancellor, your beloved latino &#8220;geniuses&#8221; look at you and see nothing more than some weak, wrinkled, old blanco with a funny name. The latino invaders you praise drift off to sleep every night, confident that people who look like you and who dress like you and who talk like you, will be out of the way soon enough. </p>
<p>And just as soon as you are, they&rsquo;ll replace you with one of their own, they&rsquo;ll take down your portrait, they&rsquo;ll repaint your office, and they&rsquo;ll never look back. <br>

		<p>So, there are issues, topics, and statistics that should never be talked about or discussed - lest the wrong sort of people take up violence or use unkind words&hellip; For example, discussing Berkeley&rsquo;s efforts to still used affirmative action on campus - that&rsquo;s a discussion that could give students the wrong idea.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that it is always leftists who respond to political speech by burning flags, harassing speakers, shouting down opponents, breaking windows, creating an environment where events must be cancelled for fear of violence. However, if these issues and topics are so inflammatory they cannot even be discussed, perhaps it&rsquo;s the issue itself that needs to be amended? It never seems to occur to them it might not be the speaker in need of adjustment. </p>

		<p>To get right to the the heart of the issue:Robert Birgeneau and the other whores for the greedy cheating class are racially cleansing Native Born White American youth out of the California State University system while at the same time developing China&rsquo;s youth in advanced tchnology on American soil&hellip;China is an economic and military competitor of America. Some of these Chinese youth will go back to China with advanced technology degrees after having been sudsidized by DARPA contracts-Native Born White American tax $$$$-to develope China&rsquo;s high technology sector and military technology. And the Chinese youth who stay in America will be granted US citizenship which will enable them actively paticipate-with their &#8220;American&#8221; born children- in the racial cleansing of the Native Born White American majority population out of California and America as a whole. They can vote for our racial cleansing-street by street,town by town,county by county and state by state-every time they vote at election time&hellip;makes no difference if they vote Republican or Democratic.</p>
<p>China is beng allowed by both the Republican and Democratic parties to racially cleanse Native Born White Americans out of America&hellip;.and it&rsquo;s all  legal.</p>

		<p>Chancellor Birgeneau is one of those strange and very deranged individuals, who happen to have white skin, yet hates white people and Western Civilization with incredible disdain. I strongly suspect that Birgeneau would like to see the entire North American continent and Europe transformed into his fantasy version of an ethnically diverse utopia. The tragedy is, that when it finally happens, it won&rsquo;t be a utopia, but rather, Hell on earth. As Birgeneau is being led to the gallows by his new ethnically diverse, and anti-Western Civilization rulers, he will likely be screaming that it&rsquo;s all a mistake, that he is one of the good whites. I can only imagine the look on his face.</p>

I would like to know something about his background. And how he attained this present lucrative position. Was he one of those Marxist protesters back in the 60s who were occupying offices, rioting, smashing,  and throwing bags of urine at police officers?  I see that he was a product of the university sixties. These seem to be the people who are now in positions of authority and who are ruling us. Nice people, huh?</p>

<p>Well, if they&rsquo;re undocumented they&rsquo;re violating the law! Why shouldn&rsquo;t they be discriminated from people who are not breaking the law?  </p>
<p>The point of criminal law is to dissuade people from violations, then identify, separate and punish those who refuse. The age of Obama is akin to life in an alternate universe where reality can be changed by the whims of political edict.      </p>

<p>Robet Birgeneau comes from a working class Canadian Catholic background. A Catholic priest paid for his education at an eltie Catholic high school..and then on to the University of Tornonto for a physics degree and a phd..and from their IBM amd MIT. The facts about Birgeneau&rsquo;s own life expose the lie that asian legal immigration is necessary for both America and Canada to meet America and Canada&rsquo;s high tech labor needs.</p>
<p>For 500 huundred thousand dollars a year,Robert Birgeneau is willing to racially cleanse his own kind out of the US and Canadan tech fields&hellip;. and US and Canada as a whole. He is a sociopathic traitor&hellip;treason is the reason.</p>

		<p>These Politicos at places like Berkeley are going to have<br>
to make difficult decisions about reducing the numbers of Asian Students like Chinese. They will have to not because They care<br>
about White People, but because Asians will predominate at the expense of All others. I personally look forward to seeing Them squirming as They make discriminatory decisions because I am tired<br>
of Their Anti Racism piety.</p>

		<p>University of California Berkeley:The goal of constructive criticism news has never been to control or reflect public taste. Neither thing is possible. <br>
When UC Berkeley announced its elimination of student sports including baseball, men&rsquo;s, women&rsquo;s gymnastics, women&rsquo;s lacrosse teams and its defunding of the national-champion men&rsquo;s rugby team, the chancellor sighed, &ldquo;Sorry, but this was necessary!&rdquo; <br>
But was it?  Yes, the university is in dire financial straits. Yet $3 million was somehow found by Chancellor Robert J Birgeneau to pay the Bain consulting firm to uncover waste, inefficiencies in UC Berkeley (Cal), despite the fact that a prominent East Coast university was accomplishing the same thing without expensive consultants.   <br>
Essentially, the process requires collecting, analyzing information from faculty, staff.  Apparently, Cal senior management believe that the faculty, staff of their world-class university lacks the cognitive ability, integrity, energy to identify millions in savings.  If consultants are necessary, the reason is clear:  the chancellor has lost credibility with the people who provided the information to the consultants.  Chancellor Robert J Birgeneau has reigned for eight years, during which time the inefficiencies proliferated to $150 million.  Even as Bain&rsquo;s recommendations are implemented (&lsquo;They told me to do it&rsquo;, Birgeneau), credibility, trust, problems remain.  <br>
Bain is interviewing faculty, staff, senior management and academic senate leaders to identify $150 million in inefficiencies, most of which could have been found internally. One easy-to-identify problem, for example, was wasteful procurement practices such as failing to secure bulk discounts on printers.  But Birgeneau apparently has no concept of savings:  even in procuring a consulting firm he failed to receive proposals from other firms.</p>
<p>Students, staff, faculty, California Legislators are the victims of his incompetent decisions.   Now that sports teams are feeling the pinch, perhaps the California Alumni, benefactors, donors, will demand to know why Birgeneau is raking in $500,000 a year while abdicating his work responsibilities.</p>
<p>Let there be light.</p>
<p>The author, who has 35 years&rsquo; consulting experience, has taught at University of California Berkeley, where he was able to observe the culture and the way the senior management operates.<br>
PS University of California Berkeley (Cal) ranking drops.  In 2004, for example, the London-based Times Higher Education ranked Cal the 2nd leading research university in the world, just behind Harvard; in 2009 that ranking had tumbled to 39th place.<br>

<p>_______________________</p>
<p>Right there, I can see some of the roots of his alienation. It all fits. </p>
<p>A French (Canadian) Catholic, growing up in very Anglo, Protestant Toronto [as it was then] could have felt uncomfortable and like an outsider looking in, a guest in someone else&rsquo;s home. This childhood experience of being an outsider  could have given him a fundamental, knee-jerk sense of alienation and led him to identify all his life with &#8220;minorities&#8221; against the &#8220;oppressive majority&#8221;. White though he is, he shares the minority  &#8220;us against you&#8221;  mentality.</p>
<p>Other powerful minorities, recognizing this trait in him, would have been delighted to promote him to positions of power. Thus, he could help do their work of undermining the majority without attracting attention to themselves. Traitor whites are always welcomed.</p>
<p>American whites would look on and be baffled at his &#8220;treason&#8221;, not understanding the social dynamics behind this. (As a Canadian, and French at that, he doesn&rsquo;t identify with them.)</p>
<p>In sum, this is another good argument against &#8220;Diversity&#8221;. Diversity only breeds trouble.</p>
