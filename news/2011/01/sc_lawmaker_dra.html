<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like a snow day, until you have to make it up. Today thousands of kids will be in the classroom on a day they would otherwise have off for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. That&rsquo;s rankled many people, including a state lawmaker in Rock Hill who wants to make sure MLK day isn&rsquo;t used again as a make-up day. But he says his constituents have also asked him to see to it that Confederate Memorial Day not be used the same way.</p>
<p>Rock Hill Schools is just one of several districts that has made people unhappy by sending kids to the classroom on Martin Luther King Day. The district&rsquo;s spokeswoman Elaine Baker expects she&rsquo;ll have more upset parents on hand when school is in session President&rsquo;s Day and Memorial Day. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State Representative John King [D-York County] is {snip} working on a bill to make sure school districts don&rsquo;t use Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a snow make-up day. </p>
<p>&#8220;While we should be maximizing the educational opportunity for each and every child in South Carolina, we should also be mindful of the heritage and struggle of the people in South Carolina,&#8221; says King. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Banning snow make-up days on Confederate Memorial Day, which falls on May 10th, wouldn&rsquo;t change much since most South Carolina schools don&rsquo;t observe the holiday. Baker with Rock Hill Schools says she never heard of the holiday until she was asked to poll other districts a few years ago on how they recognize it. Baker found only two districts had the day off.</p>

<p>Hold it right there, Lisa Miller.  Just exactly <i>who</i> are these &#8220;people&#8221; who are so terribly, terribly unhappy?  They couldn&rsquo;t be whiney blacks, now, could they?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The district&rsquo;s spokeswoman Elaine Baker expects she&rsquo;ll have more upset parents on hand when school is in session President&rsquo;s Day and Memorial Day.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Nonsense.  &#8220;President&rsquo;s Day&#8221; is already a degraded mockery of what was once two holidays honoring White presidents.  If any students even remember its significance, their White parents&rsquo; complaints (blacks could care less) will be brushed aside.  And Memorial Day, a make-up day?  Not a chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spokeswoman Elaine Baker&#8221; knows perfectly well that MLK day is the only one considered sacred by blacks and a handful of White liberals.  She&rsquo;s just blowing a smokescreen to give the appearance of even-handedness.  But fewer and fewer Whites are fooled by such juvenile double-talk any longer.<br>

I&rsquo;m not an MLK JR scholar but from what black people tell me about Mr. King, I have to believe that he would want black children in school learning.</p>

		<p>In the big picture, does it really matter having a make up day in a predominately black public school district?  It&rsquo;s not like were going to get one more rocket scientist 15 years later, either way. </p>

		<p>I wonder when the proposal is going to be made to put MLK&rsquo;s portrait on U.S. money! I mean, it is only fitting that he be the only NON DEAD PRES on money along with having the only national holiday for his birthday&hellip;.Why did I have to think of this? ((sarcasm off))</p>

		<p>How many of you are aware that January 17th is also the birthday of Benjamin Franklin. I learned that from a brochure that came with a stove that I bought a few years ago. I didn&rsquo;t know about it until then because a highly literate White genius of unquestionable integrity who was instrumental in forming our nation apparently doesn&rsquo;t deserve as much fanfare as a prostitute-loving, foul-mouthed, plagiarizing, Black communist who was instrumental in undermining the way of life of the historical majority of our nation.</p>
<p>I think we need to honor Mr. Franklin on his birthday because he deserves it, and I think we need to continue to honor Mike King&rsquo;s birthday so that Blacks won&rsquo;t burn down things that White people will have to replace.</p>
<p>Maybe Hallmark would cough up a few cards for Franklin/King Day. Maybe stores would have sales in honor of the mismatched duo. You know, the kind of stuff they do for REAL holidays.</p>

		<p>MLK day is the great shame of our nation.  An enduring reminder that we are no longer an enlightened constitutional republic but rather a quasi-communist slave state&hellip;&hellip;the novel 1984 made manifest.  Where gross lies that can easily and instantly debunked are treated as doctrinal truth that must not be questioned&hellip;..or else.</p>
<p>MLK was a complete fraud&hellip;..a literal enemy agent before we fell to communism.  An alcoholic and drug user.  A gross sexual deviant who enjoyed using violence against women, especially white women.  A racist and inciter to racist violence against whites.</p>
<p>There is literally nothing about this man that is the truth.  He was the prototype of white worship of evil blacks and the selling out of blacks as a tool of ethnic cleansing and a sinister agenda.  The man was unspeakably foul.  And the fruit of what he did is even more foul&hellip;..with victims that number in the millions&hellip;..at a cost that measures in the trillions.</p>
<p>The truth is WELL documented&hellip;..and can be learned by anyone who has a mind to, within 10 seconds.  The truth has been documented for decades, never mind the illegal and completely outrageous sealing of his criminal record.</p>
<p>Yet, to speak the truth risks death threats, loss of employment, ostracism, even imprisonment from whites&hellip;.who KNOW the truth but prefer to act as if they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Our country has freedom as its very basis.  Freedom of speech is written into the very most basic foundation of our way of life.  Yet, every one of us meets the definition of a slave by the old greek proverb&hellip;.&#8221;a true slave is the man who cannot speak his mind&#8221;.  </p>
<p>What makes this particularly shameful is the widespread availability of the truth.  White people have power&hellip;..REAL power, of the type that no other enslaved people have ever known.  We are smarter, stronger, than our masters.  We are well informed.  We have powerful knowledge, both as individuals and freely available for rapid absorption as needed to solve any problem.  We have wealth.  We have weapons&hellip;..more than the entire might of the world&rsquo;s militaries combined.</p>
<p>Yet we choose&hellip;.we CHOOSE slavery.  It would be nothing to rise up and destroy those who dare to victimize us.  But we can&rsquo;t be bothered.</p>
<p>After all, dancing with the stars is on&hellip;.here let me turn it up so I can&rsquo;t hear my neighbor being raped by blacks celebrating MLK day.</p>

<p>Do you have a link specifically for these charges?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested because I&rsquo;d like to add them to my arsenal, but I must have solid back-up.  (I already know about the other FACTS:  plagiarism, womanizing, brutality, foul-mouth, theft, just not the drug use or alcoholism).</p>

		<p>DeadinDenver, you make an excellent point. But I think the problem in the proposal is the implication that MLK is somehow sacrosanct and that his &#8220;day&#8221; should be, too. </p>
<p>As the late Samuel Francis observed in an excellent column on this topic, MLK Day is the only holiday in this country that seems to be observed with some regard for its original meaning. (How many Americans actually focus on the birth or resurrection of Christ?)</p>
<p>Having blacks in school means that for at least six or seven hours any mayhem they may cause is confined to the school grounds and the rest of society is spared.</p>

		<p>Question: Do the little darlings REALLY have the day off? Or are they simply expected to join their teachers, principals etc. in extracurricular activities such as MLK Day parades and other events honoring &#8220;the slain civil rights leader&#8221;?</p>

		<p>The annual MLK observance at the state house in Columbia SC had an interesting twist this year:</p>
<p> The event is held on the north side steps of the statehouse. Prominent at that location is a large bronze statue of George Washington. This year, the NAACP constructed a &#8220;box&#8221; to conceal the Father of His Country from view so that participants would not be offended by his presence.</p>

		<p>The man was unspeakably foul. But the stench from his white liberal minions is more foul. I saw a teacher talking to a white child in first grade. &#8220;Now, can you say&hellip;&#8221;Martin Luther King?&#8221;.<br>

		<p>No question &hellip; MLK day shouldn&rsquo;t be used for a &#8220;snow&#8221; make-up day.  Why not?  Snow is white &hellip;</p>
