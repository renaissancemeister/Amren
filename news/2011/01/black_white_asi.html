<p>The crop of students moving through college right now includes the largest group of mixed-race people ever to come of age in the United States, and they are only the vanguard: the country is in the midst of a demographic shift driven by immigration and intermarriage.</p>
<p>One in seven new marriages is between spouses of different races or ethnicities, according to data from 2008 and 2009 that was analyzed by the Pew Research Center. Multiracial and multiethnic Americans (usually grouped together as &#8220;mixed race&#8221;) are one of the country&rsquo;s fastest-growing demographic groups. And experts expect the racial results of the 2010 census, which will start to be released next month, to show the trend continuing or accelerating.</p>
<p>Many young adults of mixed backgrounds are rejecting the color lines that have defined Americans for generations in favor of a much more fluid sense of identity. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Along those lines, it is telling that the rates of intermarriage are lowest between blacks and whites, indicative of the enduring economic and social distance between them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want a color-blind society at all,&#8221; Ms. Wood said. &#8220;I just want both my races to be acknowledged.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I am sick of seeing so many people that you cannot tell what race they are. They are literally racially ambiguous. </p>
<p>This did not happen overnight. I think this was engineerd long ago by the government, self-hating Whites and other traitors to weaken and eventually destroy the White race. </p>

		<p>I have a nephew who married a Black woman in 1996. They have three children 13, 11 and 8. The oldest will be 14 in March. The other two will be 12 and 9 in June and November of this year. All Boys.</p>
<p>The kids are admittedly attractive. They are also intelligent, witty and well behaved. However, while I am coridal to the kids, I have made it clear to Steve (my nephew) that I do think he has greatly dissapointed me by diluting our family gene pool. </p>
<p>Their other cousins accept them as well as my siblings. In fact, my oldest sister Holly and my mother who is in her late 70s adore them. My father has never fully accepted this, but he tolerates (again tolerates, not accepts them) and treats them respectfully.</p>
<p>It seems I am seeing a growing number of bi-racial and mixed race children. Go to any mall, playground or public school and you will see this.    </p>

		<p>There may well be a deliberate selection effect here.  Are there really more &#8220;mixed-race&#8221; students today, or is it just that more and more students are encouraged to <i>identify</i> themselves in such terms?  I don&rsquo;t seem to recall any shortage of mulattoes in the Fifties and Sixties.<br>

		<p>Interesting, if true these statistics actually seem to indicate downward trend for intermarriage as far as whites go.  The last study I read showed that one out of ten white marriages were to a person of another race(I highly doubted it, because before that in the 80s it was 1-2%).  The latest data from this article would put it at 0.3-0.5 out of 10, and it seems to jump back and forth from 1% to nearly 5% on a yearly basis.  I also wonder how many people who list themselves as &#8220;native american&#8221; are actually native americans, and not whites with a random cherokee ancestor four or five generations removed.</p>
<p>Fascinating, but really it just confirms what most of us already knew.  Interracial marriages are the rarest among whites, and no one wants a black woman(sorry, but facts are facts!).</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t true.  Balkan people are very proud of who they are ethnically and identify with their groups fairly fiercely.  I lived there.  During Yugoslavia they got along due to the management that depended on one man, Marshall Tito.  After his death, things corrupted and then fell apart.  As my Slovenian friend said, &#8220;Then all the worst people came out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even so, I think it ought to be possible to preserve one&rsquo;s heritage and racial ethnic identity without fighting about it.  Asia and Japan seem to be able to do it.  The white, Western world seems to be unable to accept that there can be diverse groups and so there is a drive to destroy differences, but it is an evil and artificial thing to do and nothing good will come of it.  Humankind will devolve as it seems to be already and brutality will return, as it also is already.</p>

You apprently did not read the article close enough. It said that Black/White intermarriges were the least common, but had incresed since the 1980s whereas, White Hispanic marriges have declined yet  White/Asain marriages (espeicially White male/Asain women marriages are the most common pairing of interrracial marriages. </p>

		<p>There are only 7 million mixed race individuals living in the country and out of that number I&rsquo;d say only 4 million were mixed with White.  Also consider that they are also counting Whites married to White Hispanics which lowers the numbers even further.  I also recall a Census story a few years ago lamenting the fact that fewer people decided to list multiracial identity.  I can&rsquo;t find the story now but the number dropped to around 1.2 percent.  Eventually all of these minorities will drop being biracial and identify with what they look like such as black, oriental or latino.   </p>

		<p> Once again, the &#8220;great liberal dream&#8221; of the elimination of racism through miscegenation is being surreptitiously promoted by the controlled media.  Miscegenation as a scheme to eliminate racism never worked historically and never will. The lighter skinned minority will rise to the top, look at the Caribbean, Haiti, Brazil, and the darker skinned will be pushed to the bottom. Intermixture in most cases leads to more conflict and a lowering of the quality of the population, not, as most liberals hope, to harmony and &ldquo;hybrid vigor&rdquo;. Why aren&rsquo;t whites being encouraged to preserve their unique cultures and racial genotypes  &mdash;  every other group in America is encouraged. </p>

		<p>To the extent that whites do marry outside of our race, it generally takes the form of white men marrying Asian women, or white women marrying black men. The reasons for this pattern are not well understood, but it generally seems that &#8220;nerdy&#8221; but successful white men find it difficult to find a white wife, so they marry Asian women who are not bothered by their &#8220;nerdiness&#8221;, while many upwardly mobile black men use their success as a means of attracting a white wife. This actually worsens racial tensions, as Asian men feel that white men are stealing their women, and black women think that white women are taking the most successful black men, and makes both groups feel very bitterly towards whites in general.<br>
This also means that the best white genes are being lost to the white gene pool, as some of the most intelligent white men contribute their genes to mixed-race Asian children rather than to white children, while on the other hand, intermarriage with blacks means a cohort of lower-IQ mulatto children (since, even if their fathers are a cut above the average black in IQ, the children still regress towards the average of the means for their parents&rsquo; races) who will probably identify with their black father over their white mother, even if the father abandons them. Overall, then, intermarriage makes whites less intelligent, less numerous, and creates even more bitter enemies among nonwhites. Whoever decided that white-nonwhite intermarriage was a good idea should lose all credibility.</p>
<p>As for the &#8220;hybrid vigor&#8221; claim, that only works with severely inbred groups with high rates of harmful recessive gene diseases,  such as mountain villages where a few hundred people are all closely related to each other. It matters not at all in the case of continental-scale races interbreeding, at which point you&rsquo;re more likely to see hybrid incompatibilites, where genes that evolved to work with other genes common in one continental-scale race work badly ouside that continental-scale race. </p>

		<p>An aspect of dealing with interracial couples that I&rsquo;ve experienced is that it&rsquo;s not possible to not get along with an interracial couple without being considered a racist. I have an aunt who married outside of her race and had a number of interracial children whom she&rsquo;d adopted or fostered. Despite the public image of interracial couples as loving, gentle people who&rsquo;d never hurt a fly, both my aunt and uncle were very nasty people. When I was 7 years old, I was supposed to spend the summer at their house. I asked my mother not to have to go, and was sent to my grandmother&rsquo;s instead. The next year, on my eighth birthday, I was sent off to my aunt&rsquo;s house for the summer after weeks of begging my mother not to send me. It wasn&rsquo;t earthly possible that this couple were not nice people. It was automatically presumed that I was prejudiced towards dark-skinned people or interracial couples.</p>
<p>I mentioned that my aunt had a number of interracial adoptive and foster children. There were four in all, and as far as I know, they weren&rsquo;t biologically related to each other. In that household alone, that means that there was a total of 8 biological parents who had produced children whom they either couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t take care of. Interracial couples do seem to produce more than their fair share of children who wind up in the government&rsquo;s care.  </p>

This is inaccurate wishful thinking. The fac this that there are far more than 7,000,000 biracial and multiracal people in America. In California and New York combined, the numbers would easily surpras such a figure. </p>
<p>Secondly, there is no indication that bi-racial or mulit-racial people will decide to define themselves as just one race. If anything, it appears that most will decide to identify themsleves as various ethnicities.</p>

		<p>Anyone with any dog in this hunt ought to read Faulkner.  His work was, admittedly, &#8220;fiction,&#8221; but he was spot on when dealing with the devastating effects of miscegenation.  &#8220;Absalom, Absalom&#8221; was his masterwork in this respect.  A father commands his son to kill his sister&rsquo;s fiancee, because she will commit the sin of miscegenation.  The sin will also involve incest, but the miscegenation is the greater sin.  The fiancee is an octoroon, and the half brother of the son commanded to kill him, but  &mdash;  the sin is miscegenation.</p>

		<p>I agree, you do see a lot more people under 25 - 30 who are mixed race than in my childhood. Where I grew up, we had a few mulattoes here and there. There were a couple of kids in my high school who were half White and half Asian (mom was a war bride from Korea). However, their intelligence and lack of criminal activity placed them in the &#8220;white classes&#8221; and they were treated like most other whites at my school. A brother in law is probably 1/16 or 1/32nd Indian (Feather not Dot), but he doesn&rsquo;t identify as such. </p>
<p>My wife has a cousin who is married to a man of Chinese ancestry and they have two children. As with the two in my high school, I don&rsquo;t believe these kids will turn out to be gang bangers. As for their looks, they tend to favor dad a lot more than mom. Both parents are college graduates and reasonably successful people. I would imagine that both sets of parents had a long talk with this relative and her future husband before their wedding day. They are both adults and free to choose, however, I suspect each set of parents secretly wished that their child would marry within their respective race. </p>
<p>While serving in the Navy, I saw quite a few pairings of white males and Asian females. Some of the kids were quite attractive and others didn&rsquo;t turn out so well. At a previous job, I had a manager who was black and was married to a white woman. Both were former officers in the military. Both the husband and wife were fairly pleasant looking and they had one son and two daughters. The son was a copy of dad, just a couple of shades lighter. As for the daughters; well, to be charitable, lets just say that they were at the opposite end of the spectrum from Halle Berry or Beyonce. </p>
<p>If someone wishes to check off multiple boxes on the census form, so be it. I do not personally hold anything against you if you happen to be of multiple races. However, it is not whitey&rsquo;s fault if everything in life isn&rsquo;t perfect. Don&rsquo;t show up with your hat in hand demanding quotas for 1/2, 1/4th, 1/6th, 1/8th or whatever you happen to be. </p>
<p>Would I make interracial marriage illegal, no. But you can bet your bottom dollar that I will STRONGLY ENCOURAGE my kids to marry white spouses. </p>

		<p>White male and asian female pairings are increasing rapidly it seems, for many white men much prefer asian women over their own kind. The offspring of such marriages usually look like mestizos or central asians, while some others could pass for white. I haven&rsquo;t noticed any outstanding geniuses coming out of such an admixture, the children usually seem dull. Just look at Mexico and the &#8220;stans&#8221; of central asia: do these eurasian nations look impressive at all?</p>

		<p>However, I think I miss something here with all those numbers. What does the sentence &#8220;White in combination with one or more other races&#8221; actually mean?</p>
<p>If we check the &#8220;Black or African American in combination with one or more other races&#8221; data (from the same survey), we see the number is 2,345,399 people.</p>
<p>The same with &#8220;Asian in combination with one or more other races&#8221;: 1,698,982 people.</p>
<p>5,635,151 + 2,345,399 + 1,698,982 + [&hellip;]* &gt; 7,013,872</p>

		<p>To try to complete the whole sum properly:</p>
<p> - American Indian and Alaska Native in combination with one or more other races: 2,140,840</p>
<p> - Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander in combination with one or more other races: 399,549</p>
<p> - Some other race in combination with one or more other races: 1,433,079</p>
<p><br>
Then, the sum of all races in combination with one or more other races is as follows:</p>
<p>5,635,151 + 2,345,399 + 1,698,982 + 2,140,840 + 399,549 + 1,433,079 = 13,653,000 &gt; 7,013,872</p>

		<p>#6 Obongo, I do have to think there are many more mixed race people in this country than there ever have been. Due to many reasons, including immigration and global job opportunities, more and more races have been coming in contact with each other than wouldn&rsquo;t have 30 -40 years ago and more.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t go a day without seeing a number of cases of, &#8220;What kind of Heinz 57 is SHE/HE?&#8221; Never in my life have I seen so many unidentifiable conglomerations of brown. It&rsquo;s not unusual now to know three or four families (often even including ones own) that have a &#8220;****** in the woodpile.&#8221; That didn&rsquo;t used to happen on today&rsquo;s scale. I&rsquo;m going to give myself a whiplash shaking my head every time I see it.</p>

		<p>As an answer to my previous posts (#24 &amp; #25), I have to explain that I was wrong when I suggested that the number of people of two or more races had to be the sum of all different &#8220;race and ethnicity in combination with one or more other races&#8221; numbers.<br>
 <br>
This is because each &#8220;race and ethnicity in combination with one or more other races&#8221; group contains part of the people from the other races and ethnicities.</p>
<p>So, I still ask myself what I said previously on my comment #22: if Whites in combination with one or more other races are 5,635,151 out of 7,013,872 people of two or more races, how can interracial marriages be the rarest among whites?</p>

<p>I only come up with about 1,078,000 Whites involved in interracial marriage from 2006 statistics.  I added up the number of White males and females married to other races.<br>

<p>Assuming your numbers are right this total figure would represent 40-50 years of cumulative increase in miscegenation.  Another factor to consider is that some people will mark down mixed race if they have an American Indian in their ancestry.  Another real possibility is that people are lying on the Census, possibly for political and ideological reasons.  I bring this up because I live in a small town and I notice some peculiar things that just don&rsquo;t add up. I used to see a mixed race couple about every month.  They go into the stores together without getting a shopping cart and usually don&rsquo;t buy anything.  Sometimes they have a black kid with them, not a mulatto, but a black kid.  It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be the White mother&rsquo;s child and with black men having a reputation for abandoning their children, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s his either.  Is it a rent-a-kid?  What led me to start really noticing these things was when a few years back I started seeing a few White with black women.  I&rsquo;m not joking about this but the men looked like supermodels and the women looked like  Queen Latifa in fake hair.  One particular instance I remember was a couple who looked an awful lot like a young Tom Selleck with the Jefferson&rsquo;s maid.  I would even go so far as to say I suspect some of these men are gay. That&rsquo;s not the only odd thing.  These people come and go and you never see the same couple again or even out separately.  Lately, these occurrences have completely vanished but a person would think by the number of sightings over the years they made up at least 10 percent of our town&rsquo;s population.        </p>

		<p>It may be that more students choose &#8220;mixed&#8221; out of frustration, or just plain rebellion against a system that has been insisting on them being &#8220;color blind&#8221; and then asking at every turn which racial group they belong to in order to discriminate against whites, and particularly white males.  </p>
<p>Some of the students may actually sense that white males are being unduly hurt by the old strategy of guilt tripping whites and white males.  They just see their friends being hurt by a system that claims to promote fairness and diversity.  The tendency of youth is to reject the old school ideologies, going by what they experience in their own lives.  It could be that they are learning social justice too well.</p>
