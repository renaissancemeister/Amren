			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), January 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two mothers who were kicked out of a council-funded playgroup spoke of their humiliation today after being told the group was for immigrant families only.</p>
<p>Emma Knightley, 25, and Kimberley Wildman, 27, turned up at the &#8216;Making Links&rsquo; playgroup with their children Imogen, 21 months, and Olivia, 18 months.</p>
<p>But they were stunned when organisers at the centre in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, ordered them to leave after demanding to know &#8216;what country are you from?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The best friends were told that only foreign mothers and their children are welcome at the council-funded playgroup  &mdash;  which they have accused of discrimination.</p>
<p>Shop worker Emma, who lives in St Neots, booked a place at the playgroup six weeks ago after it was recommended by a mixed-race friend.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;The first thing I was asked about was my nationality and when I said I was British I was told we had to leave.</p>
<p>&#8216;She said are you not aware this is for foreign people only?</p>
<p>&#8216;I said I knew it was trying to integrate people into the community but didn&rsquo;t realise that meant British people and their children were banned.</p>
<p>&#8216;I felt humiliated. It shouldn&rsquo;t matter what nationality you are we shouldn&rsquo;t be discriminated against.</p>
<p>&#8216;You wouldn&rsquo;t get away with a British-only mum and children&rsquo;s group.</p>
<p>&#8216;We want to welcome other nations to the community but turning British people away is not the way to do this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trainee midwife Kimberley, also from St Neots, chose the group because it was free  &mdash;  whereas other groups in the area charged £2.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;They asked me what race I was and I said British. They said I couldn&rsquo;t come in. It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>&#8216;Surely if this group is about making links in the community they should let all people in, regardless of race or nationality.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s a real shame. I want my children to play with children from other races and integrate in the community because that stops discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8216;I can&rsquo;t believe we were discriminated against because we are British.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Making Links, which is based at the Priory Centre in the town, is funded by a £1,000 annual grant from St Neots Town Council.</p>
<p>The community group is staffed by church volunteers and also receives money from the Co-operative community development fund and the Open Door Church in St Neots.</p>
<p>According to Making Links&rsquo; website the group &#8216;seeks to operate in the spirit of the Commission for Racial Equality&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Its targets include: &#8216;bringing communities together and facilitating interaction between them&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The website claims about 50 women attend the weekly sessions every Thursday.</p>
<p>It adds: &#8216;Making Links frees them from feelings of isolation, helps them build multicultural friendships and empowers them with knowledge about the local community.</p>
<p>&#8216;Thus Making Links presents a friendly St Neots face to people who might otherwise be outsiders.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Roger Owen, administrator for Making Links, said that the group is not a &#8216;typical&rsquo; playgroup and is funded entirely for women from other nationalities.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;We believe there are plenty of other alternatives for British mothers in the town.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have had an issue with men turning up before and back then we told them the group is strictly for mothers so it&rsquo;s nothing to do with racial discrimination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to the Equality and Human Rights Commission website, under the Equality Act 2010 it is not unlawful to set up a group especially for a particular ethnic or national group.</p>
<p>Under the act discrimination based on colour is unlawful.</p>
<p>No-one from St Neots Town Council was available for comment.<br>

<p>I doubt that very much.  The money must come from the British taxpayers.  perhaps it comes from a mosque, but the mosques are all supported by the British government.</p>

<p>As an aside, is Emma Knightley the sister of the beautiful actress, Keira Knightley?  If so, the latter should use her clout immediately and stand tall for the UK.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s about the money.</p>
<p>Immigrant assistance programs, including children&rsquo;s recreation, are funded by the public purse. The objective is for government to facilitate immigrant&rsquo;s integration into the fabric of the economy, so that they may consume energy, food, goods and services.</p>
<p>There is no money for families already in Britain. They hold no interest for the masters of economic consumption and growth. </p>

		<p>I do have to wonder about moms who would want their kids to play with kids of other races. Just about every time my daughter has been around kids of other races it has not turned out well. I would certainly not seek this sort of thing out. It seems somewhat counterproductive- to teach moms to be more integrated in to the community ban the native community! I also wonder if I as an American citizen or an immigrant of say- Germany or France would be banned as well. Oh wait- I think I know the answer.</p>

Well that&rsquo;s exactly what took place: the mothers were turned away for being WHITE. </p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s &#8220;unlawful,&#8221; then charge this wogs-only playgroup with &#8220;discrimination.&#8221; </p>
<p>Then defund and dissolve the playgroup. </p>
<p>Then deport everybody associated with it: adults, children, the lot.</p>

		<p>Stupid women, don&rsquo;t you know that it is now you who are the foreigners in England?  I have no pity or sympathy for them.  They are already beyond help, having drunken thirstily the Kool-Aid of multikulturalism.  How vapid and brainwashed does a white mother have to be to state &#8220;I want my children to play with children from other races and integrate in the community because that stops discrimination&#8221;.  So they can grow up and be preyed upon by Pakistani pedophile gangs or used and abused by a Bantu?  Screw them.</p>

Doesn&rsquo;t the UK have anti-discrimination laws? Even if this was privately funded (which is highly doubtful) I can&rsquo;t believe they have a right to exclude anyone.</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot, they&rsquo;re not white and non-Christians so our laws don&rsquo;t apply to them, only us.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that you cannot seem to get it!! No other race on this planet, except the white race, continues to insist on multiculturism and diversity despite being openly discrminated against by non-whites! Where&rsquo;s the multiculturism push in asia,africa, latin america? It&rsquo;s only white western societies expected to be open and accomodating of others,all while being openly discriminated against! </p>
<p><br>
When will enough be enough?<br>
It must be a genetic flaw in our race!</p>

<p>This is something I have long wondered about. The British fought two long, gruelling and pointless wars to the death against Germany, a country that never meant them any harm or ill-will, but roll over and die in the face of a REAl foreign invasion. Call it the Kaiser&rsquo;s revenge. He&rsquo;d recognize Berlin more then Churchill would recognize London.</p>

		<p>British does not mean English. British does not mean White. There is no such race as British. There is an English race. British includes all children born in UK of aliens, legal or not. This group may have excluded these children because the group was set up by muslim immigrants awaiting permission to remain and claim housing and cash benefits. The exclusion of men and non-muslim women and children is typical of muslim womens groups although they would claim this is &#8216;cultural&rsquo; as exclusion based on colour is illegal. &#8220;According to the Equality and Human Rights Commission website, under the Equality Act 2010 it is not unlawful to set up a group especially for a particular ethnic or national group&#8221;.  However this excludes White English as this EHRC quango is run by non-Whites and is racist against all and any White person, group or organisation although fully funded by the Government to fight all real or perceived slights against non-Whites. Its targets include: &lsquo;bringing communities together and facilitating interaction between them&rsquo;. Muslims totally reject the idea of interaction with non-muslims but will obviously take the funding opportunity to set up their own exclusive group. I suspect the mothers and children refused permission to use the group are african and the group is pakistani or bangladeshi. My comments about the nationalities involved are my personal opinion based on years of observation of the gradual disintegration of White England and is further proof that different creeds, cultures, colours and religions simply do not integrate and should remain within their traditional homeland instead of setting up their own ghettos in England.</p>

Knightley and Wildman deserved to be banned for believing that  Britains multiculturalism, could ever afford them the right to live side-by-side with non-whites.<br>
The world just does not work like that.<br>
Races and ethnicities have different degrees of perception guided by their own genetics.<br>
The only good side to non-white immigration in Britain is that the governments of the countries non-white immigrants come from don&rsquo;t care what Britain does with them.<br>
If Britons shot them in the street, immigrant countries would probably thank their higher authorities.<br>
A white society of high function and beauty does not deserve this kind of privelege.</p>

		<p>@ 4) Exposure to children of different races was certainly a large part of my racial realism education.</p>
<p>Though I doubt that&rsquo;s the mother&rsquo;s intent in this case, it will probably be the result.  I feel so bad for race-denying parents, it must be hard to counter act the &#8220;Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?&#8221; factor.</p>

<p>The BNP were rightly &#8216;reined in&rsquo; and &#8216;forced&rsquo; to accept non-white members. The were simply forced to open up membership to everyone&hellip; that explains this case&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not suprised at this appalling act of discrimination,but I have only limited sympathy for English people who insist on cowering behind the phoney epithet &#8220;british&#8221;.This kind of race hate would be far harder to put into effect if Anglo-Saxons stood up for themselves culturally,although given the fact that Marxist cultural relativists now infest all the major institutions,I fear it may be too late.</p>

		<p>This is indeed a travesty, although I must admit I can&rsquo;t think of any reason why a sane white person would want their children playing with a bunch of little Africans and middle easterners.</p>

<p>Ahem. Which country are you writing from? Because the United States, Germany, Canada, France, Sweden, and Norway all fall into that category. In the US, the child of &#8220;Latino&#8221; immigrants gets racial preferences over the children of white taxpayers whose families have lived here for generations. This problem is not unique to Britain. It afflicts the majority of white countries. </p>
<p>&#8220;Then why were the BNP prosecuted for representing indigenous British?&#8221;<br>
Because the EU establishment hates native Europeans?</p>

		<p>I think it is important to point out why this woman is so upset.</p>
<p>She HATES white people&hellip;..despises them so much, that, despite evidence all around her that non-whites are turning her country into a sick, totalitarian banana republic where whites are routinely impoverished, dispossessed, murdered, raped and beaten&hellip;..then punished by the state for complaining.  Despite these things, she holds to multi-culturalism.</p>
<p>She wanted to be involved because she specifically did not want to be around her own kind and instead, wanted to be with what she considered her superiors.  She&rsquo;s upset about not being allowed to shed her white identity and join with those she considers better than those nasty whites.</p>
<p>What she SHOULD be doing is joining with other whites to keep their children the heck away from vicious, evil non-whites who will hurt them.  She SHOULD be working with other whites to get those non-white play groups defunded (currently being paid for with HER money) and those involved forcibly deported from her country. She SHOULD be united with millions of her own kind to protect her own kind&hellip;.politically, financially, socially, and most importantly, with armed force.</p>
<p>But she isn&rsquo;t&hellip;..because she despises them.  She spits on them.  Actually, it&rsquo;s the non-whites who spit on them.  She&rsquo;s upset because they won&rsquo;t let her join in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the old story about the Jewish man servant who watched a line of concentration camp victims being dragged by his masters house.  He laughs at their plight.</p>
<p>Then his master turns to him and goes, what are you laughing at.</p>
<p>Get in the back of the line.</p>
<p>It is exactly like that.</p>

		<p>&#8220;He said: &#8216;We believe there are plenty of other alternatives for British mothers in the town.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if there were plenty of other options if the discrimination were directed against a minority.  Imagine:  an all-British playground turns away an immigrant family, and as an excuse they say &#8220;Well, there&rsquo;s plenty of playgrounds that are open to them in the area!&#8221;  Do you think they would get away with it?</p>
<p>I hope these women realize that the immigrants do not want to get along and are only a nuisance to Briain; but, if they haven&rsquo;t figured that out already, I don&rsquo;t think this incident will make it any clearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the Equality and Human Rights Commission website, under the Equality Act 2010 it is not unlawful to set up a group especially for a particular ethnic or national group.</p>
<p>Under the act discrimination based on colour is unlawful.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you no what this means, don&rsquo;t you?  It means that every foreign group of people resiuding in Britain could discriminate and segregate themselves, except the native British.  Because, according to mainstream politicians, there is no British race.  Anyone can be considered British.  So, for example, if the BNP had a &#8220;British-only&#8221; policy, it wouldn&rsquo;t be effective, because they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to say &#8220;White British-only,&#8221; and simply &#8220;<br>
British-only&#8221; opens it up to anyone living in Britain.  A very clever loophole devised by the leftists in power.<br>
