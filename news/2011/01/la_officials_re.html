<h1>L.A. Officials Receive Video of Men Sexually Assaulting Disabled Women</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Martinez and Paul Vercammen, CNN, January 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s investigators made a public appeal Thursday in seeking at least four men who were videotaped sexually assaulting at least 10 women who appear to be severely disabled, including women in a care home.</p>
<p>The video came from 11 DVDs that an anonymous tipster dropped off last March at the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department headquarters in Monterey Park, California, said Sgt. Dan Scott.</p>
<p>The video was shot by a security camera and a handheld camera, Scott told reporters at a news conference.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several locations are depicted in the video, including at least one place that appears to be a residential care facility, authorities said. Authorities don&rsquo;t know when or where the sexual assaults occurred.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The more than 100 hours of video shows a sequence of at least 10 women being sexually assaulted by at least eight men, and investigators were able to develop composite drawings of four of the suspects, authorities said.</p>

		<p>I really didn&rsquo;t need to see the sketches to know that they weren&rsquo;t white.  There are white men that rape women, but whenever the woman victim is either elderly or severely disabled, the perp is virtually always black or Hispanic.  There has only been one case of a white man accused of raping a woman older than 70 that I can ever remember.</p>

		<p>But they had video, why can&rsquo;t they release still images of their faces.  Those sketches could apply just to about anyone in LA these days.</p>
<p>Where was the security in the group home?  So many DVDs worth of assaults?  No one saw nuthin&rsquo;?</p>

<p>Based on those sketches, the suspects include every male in LA who lives south of the 10 Freeway   &mdash;   plus a pretty large fraction of those north of it. </p>

		<p>White people in general cannot imagine just how much we are hated by the the non whites.</p>
<p>Successful white people cannot imagine just how much they are hated by the unsuccessful segment of the white population.</p>
<p>There is a lot of hate out there, and turning the other cheek in an effort to show some form of understanding, or whatever the practice is designed to show will no longer cut it.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago a 35 year old white man tried to get into my house during broad daylight.  Fortunately my wife locked the doors before taking a nap.  What was he trying to do?</p>

		<p>In our neighborhood a young white male raped an elderly woman in her eighties. <br/>
My friends husband beat his eighty one year old mother and hospitalized her.<br/>
You can find what you look for and you are looking for proof of your hatred. If I wanted to find proof of the whites (I am one) being the most evil race on earth..I can find it&hellip;Hitler, Jeffrey Dahmler&hellip;it is a long list. The answer is to quit hating and quit feeling entitled in all races.</p>
