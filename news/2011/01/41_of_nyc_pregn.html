<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eye-opening statistics about the rate of abortions in New York City have been released by the Health Department. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>41% of all New York City pregnancies end in abortion. </p>
<p>The rate for minorities is even higher. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Broken down by race for 2009: </p>
<p>Specifically non-Hispanic Blacks have a 59.8% abortion rate.</p>
<p>Hispanics have a 41.3% abortion rate.</p>
<p>Asians have a 22.7% abortion rate.</p>
<p>And non-Hispanic Whites have a 20.4% abortion rate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Back in 1998, 12 years ago, the number was actually 46%.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s keep in mind that the 24.7% white rate only concerns the white female who is pregnant.  We can only wonder how many of the fathers are non-white.</p>

		<p>Good comment, Whiteplight. </p>
<p>High Yellows  &mdash;  is that what the evangelicals are defending? </p>
<p>In many cases, yes. I read an evangelical book against abortion, in which it said that a man took his daughter in to abort his &#8220;grandson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not typical White behavior,&#8221; I thought. It was very puzzling, and something was not right.</p>
<p>Now I know that the &#8220;grandson&#8221; was a high yellow.</p>
<p>And I applaud the Roman-like virtue of the man who took his daughter in for the procedure.</p>

		<p>Worrying about percentages or numbers, how about immigration percentage or numbers since the genocidal 1965 Immigration and Reform Act ( of treason )? Oh, that&rsquo;s different, because that is anti-White/ Christian bias/ hate crime; that is encouraged by our traitorous political parties, courts and leftist media.</p>

		<p>That was the original intent of Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger.  The eugenics movement was to keep minorities in the minority.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never had much to say on this issue, but as presented here I find it all repulsive.</p>

		<p>Even so, the numbers of babies non-whites ARE having (many of which whites are forced to pay for) are greater than ever, to the point that white babies are soon to be out-numbered by non-white babies.  </p>
<p>The replacement of whites continues at an increasing pace.  </p>

		<p>This is good news. At least they are taking responsibility for their actions, and it won&rsquo;t burden the tax payers (me) for the next 18 years. Maybe those minorities are seeing how dismal life has become in this country, and don&rsquo;t want to bring a child into this world to suffer.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m probably one of the biggest racialists out there but I&rsquo;m also anti-abortion and I think people should be wary of allowing someone to frame this as a White Nationalist issue as a way to smooth it over.  Murder is murder by any race and anyhow these statistics are deceptive.  Given the fact that Whites are still the largest group in NYC, a 20 percent abortion rate means that the number of White babies being aborted is roughly the same as the number of black babies at 59 percent.  No, I don&rsquo;t approve of government dependent low IQ minorities breeding in this country but since the taxpayers are probably footing the abortion why not have the money better spent by sterilizing them in exchange for a small cash incentive?   </p>

		<p>@ #10,<br>
Yes, it would indeed be better to sterilize them for a small cash incentive. For one thing, it&rsquo;s a one time thing, as you mentioned, while abortion is a procedure that has to be repeated each pregnancy. Unfortunately, black leaders would scream &#8220;genocide&#8221; (even though they&rsquo;re reproducing faster than whites, often on the dime of white taxpayers), and whites would back off meekly. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the black women can&rsquo;t support their children, it&rsquo;s their RIGHT to have them, and to have them at your expense, according to MSM.</p>
