<h1><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/8264660/Norwegian-of-the-year-to-be-deported.html ">&#8216;Norwegian of the Year&rsquo; to Be Deported</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Osborn, Telegraph (London), January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The decision to deport Madina Salamova, 25, has sparked a nationwide debate about Norway&rsquo;s immigration laws, triggered public protests, and put the country&rsquo;s centre-left government on the defensive.</p>
<p>The girl, who is better known under her literary pseudonym &#8216;Maria Amelie&rsquo;, moved to Norway in 2003 with her parents after neighbouring Finland rejected their asylum claim. </p>
<p>Norway rejected their claim too but the family somehow evaded deportation and, despite having no papers or even a bank account, Miss Salamova then integrated into Norwegian society in a way that impressed many ordinary Norwegians.</p>
<p>She mastered Norwegian, took cleaning jobs for cash, got a degree, found herself a Norwegian boyfriend, and last year published a book about her life as an illegal immigrant to considerable acclaim.</p>
<p>Weekly news magazine Ny Tid crowned her &#8220;Norwegian of the Year&#8221; in 2010, saying she had enriched public discourse.</p>
<p>But her increasingly public profile appears to have caught the authorities&rsquo; attention.</p>
<p>Eight immigration officers arrested her last Wednesday and bundled her into the back of a van for deportation to Russia. Her parents, who come from the unstable Russian republic of North Ossetia, remain in hiding.</p>
<p>A court on Monday freed Miss Salamova from a detention centre, pending her deportation which is supposed to take place within two weeks unless she wins a reprieve. </p>
<p>Miss Salamova, speaking to the Dagsavisen newspaper, said she was &#8220;afraid for my own life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no connection to Russia and I speak more Norwegian that Russian,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Jens Stoltenberg, the Norwegian prime minister, has acknowledged that many people feel strongly about the girl&rsquo;s case but said no exceptions can be made.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must handle individuals equally and not give them special treatment just because somebody receives a lot of attention,&#8221; he told Norwegian media. &#8220;If we bend the rules for one person, we will then get thousands of refugees lodging baseless applications for asylum. Nobody wants that.&#8221; <br>

		<p>I would bet good money that if Madina Salamova were Black, Muslim, unwilling to learn Norwegian, and on public assistance<br>
the authorities would find no cause to deport her. </p>

<p>Yes, and on their way to her house they passed numerous illegal Bantus who were huddled around a fire they had started from stolen furniture, because they had already spent their government welfare checks on drugs and booze.</p>

		<p>This is an interesting example of how to read between the lines.</p>
<p>&#8216;moved to Norway in 2003 with her parents after neighbouring Finland rejected their asylum claim&rsquo;</p>
<p>READ &#8216;Illegaly entered Norway&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;the family somehow evaded deportation&rsquo;</p>
<p>READ &#8216;Knew they were illegals and purposefully evaded detection for yeras&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;Weekly news magazine Ny Tid crowned her &ldquo;Norwegian of the Year&rdquo; in 2010, saying she had enriched public discourse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>READ &#8216;Since the topic of her book fitted perfectly with a liberal bleeding heart agenda she was given a bogus award&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
I would also guess that since she fitted in and became a model citizen she was almost certainly white.<br>

<p>Ossetians are actually the closes living descendants of the Scythians and Sarmatians. And they may be related to the ancient Achaemenid Persians. But most certainly not to the today&rsquo;s population of Iran.  Unlike the modern day swarthy Iranic peoples like Perso-Iranians, Kurds and Pashtuns, the Ossetes (due to their centuries long isolation in the Caucasus mountains) have very much retained their ancestral pheno- and genotypes as evidenced by their fair and ruddy complexions. In other words, Ossetes are the closest thing that we got today to the bona-fide Indo-Iranians that once existed throughout much of Eurasia and Eastern Europe during the Antiquity.     </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a purely academic point but Salamova sounds more Slavic than Scandanavian.</p>

<p>Well, if she can speak some Russian, and she was able to master Norwegian, she can too master Russian.</p>
<p>Too bad. She is a good model for a person to become a citizen, but please, just obey the law. That is all that is asked.</p>

		<p>&rdquo;Maria Amelie&rdquo; has widespread support among Norwegians. Many of her most ardent supporters though are people who are fighting for a general amnesty for all longtime illegal immigrants. Her boyfriend is a journalist in the far-left/communist newspaper Klassekampen (The Class Struggle).</p>
<p>The title &rdquo;Norwegian of the Year&rdquo; was awarded by a left-wing magazine that introduced the award 3 years ago in order to &rdquo; widen the idea of what it means to be a Norwegian&rdquo;. (The magazine used to be owned by the Socialist Left Party)</p>
<p>Even if deported &#8220;Maria Amelie&#8221; will probably get the chance to return to Norway after a while through a job visa.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s because everyone knows that whites from Eastern Europe are the ones causing all the problems, not the mellow Africans and Muslims.</p>

		<p>In America when they want to run a story about the plight of an immigrant the trend seems to be to show some White looking person of Spanish ancestry lamenting about facing possible deportation.  A far cry from the mostly mezo-Indian population you see in every day life.</p>

		<p>#11 This Madina woman isnt even from Europe, shes from central Asia. And Stockholm have hundreds of homeless bums from eastern Europe because its easier to be a bum in Stockholm than in Romania or Bulgaria. Add tons of gypsies from eastern Europe on top of that. </p>

<p>She&rsquo;s at least enterprising, as is evidenced by the fact that she was taking full advantage of a system that evidently glorifies illegality. </p>

		<p>So, the &#8220;Norwegian of the Year: isn&rsquo;t even Norwegian.  Not only is she not ethnically a Norwegian, she isn&rsquo;t even a citizen, or even a legal resident for that matter!  Since when has speaking Norwegian, living in Norway for a few years, and finding a NJorwegian boyfriend make you a Norwegian?  It reminds me of when that Arab girl was crowned Miss America.</p>
