<h1>10 Killed by Mobsters in Mexico</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews Latino, January 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the worst incident, assailants with heavy-caliber weapons opened fire Monday at people standing on a corner in Monterrey, killing three men and two women and leaving three other men wounded, a spokesman for the Nuevo Leon state Security Council told Efe.</p>
<p>The victims had apparently just gotten off a bus, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Separately, men armed with AK-47 assault rifles gunned down brothers Benito, Juan and Heriberto Cardoza Vazquez inside a business in south Monterrey, Nuevo Leon&rsquo;s capital and the headquarters of some of Mexico&rsquo;s leading corporations.</p>
<p>Authorities say a group calling itself New Federation is responsible for more than 20 homicides so far this year in Nuevo Leon. The faction targets purported members of the Los Zetas drug cartel, currently embroiled in a turf war with other criminal organizations in northeastern Mexico.</p>
<p>Across the country in Guadalajara, Mexico&rsquo;s second-largest city, gunmen at a bar killed two musicians who declined to keep playing past closing time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Killed were the group&rsquo;s leader, 22-year-old Jonathan Martinez, and bandmate Gustavo Alejandro, 35. A club patron was wounded and taken to the Western Medical Center in Guadalajara.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Violence associated with the drug war has claimed more than 34,000 lives in Mexico since December 2006.<br>

								<h2>Mexican Prisoners Escape Through Hole in Wall</h2>
						<p>
							<i>China Post (Taipei), January 19, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Fourteen inmates broke out Monday through a hole in a wall of a jail in Mexico&rsquo;s most violent northern border state of Chihuahua, justice officials said. </p>
<p>A vehicle charged the metal gate of the Aquiles Serdan Social Rehabilitation Center to pick up the prisoners, said a statement from the state attorney general&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>The office updated the figure from 12 to 14 escaped prisoners late Monday, and said that five had been caught, along with three suspected accomplices, following air and ground searches by police.</p>
<p>An anonymous source from the office said that the prisoners had exchanged gunfire with their guards, while spokesman Carlos Gonzalez denied that they were armed.</p>
<p>Numerous convicted drug gang members from the violent border city of Ciudad Juarez have been transferred to the rehabilitation center but Gonzalez said the escapees were not highly dangerous and had been detained for robbery and assault.</p>
<p>Mexican jails are notoriously overcrowded and often see deadly riots and mass breakouts, such as the escape of 151 prisoners from a jail in the northeastern border city of Nuevo Laredo last month.</p>
<p>The latest breakout took place just three days after an armed gang killed the head of prison guards working throughout the violent state.</p>
<p>More than 3,100 people were killed in suspected drug violence in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico&rsquo;s most deadly city, last year.<br>

<p>&#8220;More than 3,100 people were killed in suspected drug violence in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico&rsquo;s most deadly city, last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>And 34,000 people have been killed in Mexico since 2006.</p>
<p>Thank God they have gun control laws in Mexico, making it illegal for a citizen to own a firearm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet they feel safer than ever now.</p>

		<p>Good point, Alex.  However, haven&rsquo;t you heard?   All that gun violence in Mexico is because of America&rsquo;s failure to have gun laws more like Mexico&rsquo;s.  All we need to do is recognize out guilt for all that Mexican violence in Mexico, adopt their laws as our own, and then Mexico will turn into a such a peaceful and prosperous place that millions of Mexicans will do anything to cross the border to go live in it.  </p>
<p>This approach may provide the solution to the whole issue of Mexican colonization of the United States.  If we simply allow the United States to be remade in Mexico&rsquo;s image, Mexicans will flee it by the tens of millions!   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s American drug money which fuels so much of this.  Let&rsquo;s change our drug laws to take the profit motive out of the drug trade.  The Mexicans have every right to blame much of this on the US, but not because of our gun laws.  It&rsquo;s our drug laws.</p>

		<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t provide much in the way of information.</p>
<p>1.  There is open civil war in Mexico right now.  The government is being challenged for its right to control Mexico.  It is losing.  As much as 1/3 of the land mass, much of it along the US border is no longer under government control.  Agents of law&hellip;.mayors, cops, judges etc. were dragged into the middle of the street and executed.  Replacements are not allowed.  The drug cartels are the law in those areas.  All of the Mexican government will meet the same fate to the extent that they lose more territory.</p>
<p>2.  They are starting to think they can get away with this in the US.  Over the last several years, lots and lots of assault weapons and military hardware has been intercepted at the border (what didn&rsquo;t they catch?)  That was yesterdays news.  But not mentioned in that news was the fact that they also captured hundreds and hundreds of uniforms.  Criminals don&rsquo;t wear uniforms.  Soldiers wear uniforms.  We are not dealing with crime, thugs, or gang members here, is my point.  A police response is fundamentally inappropriate&hellip;..this is a military problem.</p>
<p>3.  There are THREE principle players in this, not two.   The Zetas, The Federation, and the remnants of the Mexican government.  They are fighting it out in brutal fashion.  All three use terrorism against each other and against the civilian population to keep them in line&hellip;..beatings, beheading, body parts made into collages&hellip;..peoples faces carved off and made into masks.</p>
<p>4  Satanism has A LOT to do with what is going on.  The drug gangs worship some wacko goddess of death.  Many drink the blood of people they&rsquo;ve murdered to protect themselves from capture by Mexican troops.  Caves are being discovered with dozens of bodies that have had their hearts cut out and cooking gear in the corner.  Obvious ritual sacrifice followed by cannibalism.  This challenges fun filled places like Liberia for intensity of sick violence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My point is, things in mexico are a heck of alot worse than we are being allowed to know about.  And the response by the US is nowhere near appropriate compared to the level of threat.</p>

 <br>
It&rsquo;s both. Americans sell Mexicans guns and buy drugs from them. <br>
 <br>
This reminds me of the trade between the ancient Romans and the German tribesmen. The Romans sold the Germans wine which damaged the Germans individually and collectively because their bodies had not evolved the ability to deal with alcohol. The Germans sold the Romans slaves that they captured in wars with other tribes. These were made to work in Roman vineyards. </p>
