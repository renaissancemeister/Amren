<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Oxytocin {snip}, [a hormone] released from the hypothalamus region of the brain, gives rat mothers the urge to nurse their pups, keeps male prairie voles monogamous and, even more remarkable, makes people trust each other more.</p>
<p>{snip} As oxytocin comes into sharper focus, its social radius of action turns out to have definite limits. {snip} Psychologists trying to specify its role have now concluded it is the agent of ethnocentrism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a report published last year in Science, based on experiments in which subjects distributed money, he [Carsten K. W. De Dreu, a psychologist at the University of Amsterdam] and colleagues showed that doses of oxytocin made people more likely to favor the in-group at the expense of an out-group. With a new set of experiments in Tuesday&rsquo;s issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he has extended his study to ethnic attitudes, using Muslims and Germans as the out-groups for his subjects, Dutch college students.</p>

		<p>I think this ought to be taken with a huge grain of salt, until much more testing is completed.</p>
<p>Having lived in The Netherlands for a while in the late 1990s, I can report that the Dutch don&rsquo;t generally care for Germans, and also have reservations about Turks and other Islamic groups in their midst.  Nothing like loading a test!</p>

		<p>So does more oxytocin = less out-group altruistic behavior? I would be interested to know if there was some way to study which races tend to have higher oxytocin levels, if so.</p>

<p>So, it appears our most ardent Amren supporters are high in oxytocin and the ones always willing to take the side of our  opponents have inadequate amounts.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another term to identify whether or not a person has adequate amounts of oxytocin.  It&rsquo;s called loyalty to one&rsquo;s people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ethnocentrism is a very basic part of humans, and it&rsquo;s not something we can change by education.&#8221;</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s keep trying anyway, and continue reconstructing our society as if we CAN change it by re-education. That seems like a formula for success to me.</p>
<p>ice, my oxytocin must be flowing tonight, because I feel empathy for you, and feel bad that I made you feel bad. Seriously. I&rsquo;ve been trying to be a little more careful how I word things now, but I can&rsquo;t repress my intellectual habits completely.</p>
<p>And regarding empathy, here in Berkeley, Ca. I&rsquo;ve had dealings with two people involved in something called &#8220;The Empathy Movement,&#8221; which practices &#8220;non-violent communication.&#8221; </p>
<p>Both seemed to review each of their sentences before they spoke it to make sure it wouldn&rsquo;t do violence to me.</p>
<p>The aim of both &#8220;The Empathy Movement&#8221; and the &#8220;non violent communication movement&#8221; is to end conflict in the world by teaching everyone to have empathy for all peoples and to always practice non-violent communication. Obama seems to have adopted at least their rhetoric.</p>

		<p>So racism has the same root as feeding babies, faithful marriage, and trusting friends. So anti-racists neglect babies, cheat on their wives, and think only of themselves. Now I know why I haven&rsquo;t liked anti-racists. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I instantly thought the same thing. What is the PURPOSE of this study?  Is it intended to find a way to weaken in-group loyalty? A chemical way to get around ethnocentrism?   I can hardly imagine that a researcher in the Netherlands is seeking ways to reinforce it!  So why the interest? </p>
<p>Try as they might, the hostile elites have been unable to completely disarm resistance to multi-racialism among the general public, so will their next step be something chemical? </p>
<p>Our enemies are nefarious, and they will stop at nothing in their determination to abolish whiteness.</p>

		<p>An interesting side note, this thing with oxytocin has been known about for some time and commercialized.  If you google the term &#8220;Liquid Trust&#8221;, you will come across a product that you can spray on yourself and then, when around people, they will treat you as part of their &#8220;in group&#8221; as the article puts it.</p>
<p>It works too, with a couple of caveats.  The first is the company that makes it, in my opinion, has quality control issues.  Which is a nice way of saying that, among people who use products like this, we&rsquo;ve noticed that, every once in awhile, we get a bottle that is ineffective.  And it&rsquo;s that specific bottle.  We throw it away and use a different batch, which will reliably provide the effect.  Nothing can really be done about it, so you just deal with it.  About say, 10% of the time, you get a bad bottle and just toss it.</p>
<p>The other is what is in Liquid Trust is probably not oxytocin.  Oxytocin is a highly unstable molecule that has to be created, kept under controlled conditions and used immediately before it rapidly deteriorates.  Also, tests on actual oxytocin involve a nasal spray inhaler.</p>
<p>What is probably going on with Liquid Trust is they have discovered some sort of chemical that stimulates other people to create more oxytocin.  The science behind the product is controversial.  The effect is not. Anyone can see that it does its job.</p>
<p>Of course, the researchers in various colleges would never put something like this to the test.  They&rsquo;d have to admit they are 20 or more years behind the manufacturing sector with regard to the science.  While they are making vague theories based on faulty social science, certain corporations are making huge profits providing products that a small (but growing) part of the population know are useful for certain things (like getting your boss to see you as one of the in-group&hellip;..cough).</p>

		<p>the study does not surprise me, its implications are consistent with my own experience as an American, as a resident of Germany, as an admirer of Dutch culture, as and a critic of Muslim immigration:</p>
<p>1) Animals, including humans, have evolved mechanisms involving neurotransmitters which promote familial and tribal bonds/trust/concern.</p>
<p>2) The same mechanism which promotes these bonds has a reverse effect on strangers (promoting distance, distrust, indifference).</p>
<p>From this, we can conclude that &ldquo;interracial harmony&rdquo; is essentially impossible, because we are hardwired to prefer our own kind.</p>
<p>We can also suppose that the effects are relative:</p>
<p>the Dutch are &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; to the Germans and vice versa, but faced with a common enemy (e.g. genocidal levels of Muslim immigration into Europe), they should be able to develop greater fellow feeling. </p>
<p>The Dutch and the Germans, course, are very close culturally, historically, linguistically, genetically, etc., and hostility between them essentially originates from World War II.</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s conclusions quite clearly point toward the futility of engineering racial harmony.</p>
<p>Nicholas Wade has done more than any other individual to inject a note of realism concerning genetics and human biodiversity into the PC wasteland of the MSM.</p>

		<p>This is nothing but bad news and I -seriously- wish nominally intelligent university students would stop helping government or industry driven labs subvert our natural defense mechanisms with such profound and obvious outcome driven subjectivism.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Early religions were also involved in establishing group cohesion and penalizing offenders.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is why witches could be convinced to repent on the way to the burning stake.  Because once the relevance of &#8216;guilt&rsquo; (as a rational, complex, thought process, unsustainable to relaxed mind) was determined, it became like a ritual proccession and group sympathy as well as participancy increasing defined the victims response as well.</p>
<p>Which is evil.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Could oxytocin be involved in the social aspects of the religious experience? Dr. De Dreu sees oxytocin&rsquo;s effects as being very general, and no more likely to be associated with the religious experience than with soccer hooliganism. &ldquo;When people get together with others who share their values, that drives up the level of oxytocin,&rdquo; he said. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Rubbish.  What you are seeing is the outcome to what must be &#8216;more than a feeling&rsquo;.  It has to have a vector, be it vocal, visual, pheromonal or some form of EM driven &#8216;projection&rsquo; of empathy, is DANGEROUS if it&rsquo;s use can be normative to destructive behaviors which call for extreme, prolonged, rationalism to defeat.  I can&rsquo;t help but think of Pod People who only waited for you conscious mind to lose it&rsquo;s grip as you fell victim of fatigue.  Except in this case, if the effect can be induced chemically or by auditory rhythm (think mothers nursing their babies, crooning to them) then it can be -enforced-, unconsciously, before a threatening situation can trigger the rational/emotional response.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
For military commanders, nothing is more important than the group cohesion of their soldiers, for which oxytocin might now seem the ideal prescription. But this assumption is a bridge too far, Dr. De Dreu said, given that his findings are based only on lab experiments. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Rubbish.  This is not a potential military drug, anymore than PCP and LSD were for &#8216;military use&rsquo; because you need all your wits about you to operate sophisticated, multimode, miltary systems in a highly complex tactical environment.  This is a psychoactive designed specifically to be used on rebellious ethno groups.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
What does it mean that a chemical basis for ethnocentrism is embedded in the human brain? &ldquo;In the ancestral environment it was very important for people to detect in others whether they had a long-term commitment to the group,&rdquo; Dr. De Dreu said. &ldquo;Ethnocentrism is a very basic part of humans, and it&rsquo;s not something we can change by education. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the negative aspects of it should be taken for granted.&rdquo; <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Rubbish.  Endo-group DOES NOT MEAN &#8216;ethnocentric&rsquo;.  How vile to force a racial derogation upon -us-.  Oxytocin most likely faciitated -tribal- allegiances, both among the conquered/traded slaves and females and among and between hunter males and mates.</p>
<p>When typical animal behavior is to be skiddish around groups of strangers, even among their own species.</p>
<p>There were very few, if any, opportunities for this hormone to be used &#8216;ethnocentrically&rsquo; at the time oxytocin socialization/accomodation behaviors would have been an evolutionary adaptation under development in our brains.  We simply didn&rsquo;t have the geographic range or species &#8216;diversity&rsquo; to react that way.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Bruno B. Averbeck, an expert on the brain&rsquo;s emotional processes at the National Institute of Mental Health, said that the effects of oxytocin described in Dr. De Dreu&rsquo;s report were interesting but not necessarily dominant. The brain weighs emotional attitudes like those prompted by oxytocin against information available to the conscious mind. If there is no cognitive information in a situation in which a decision has to be made, like whether to trust a stranger about whom nothing is known, the brain will go with the emotional advice from its oxytocin system, but otherwise rational data will be weighed against the influence from oxytocin and may well override it, Dr. Averbeck said. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is a polite way to say that the human mind is on autopilot 90% of the time and operates without acknowledgement of it&rsquo;s higher order cognitive centers at all.  As I said above, this is also an invitation to make a drug which _sustains_ that sense-over-sensibility response.  In normalizing relations between people who nominally SHOULD be competing with each other.  Or whose behaviors are so substandard or bizarre, from one group to another, that only pharmaceutical intervention (possibly through ethno specific foods) can allow continued cooperative accomodation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Dr. Averbeck said he was amazed that a substance like oxytocin can affect such a high-level human behavior. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really surprising to me that this neurotransmitter can so specifically affect these social behaviors,&rdquo; he said. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Look at a black or hispanic and realize that this is the reason why there is only the thinnest veneer of socializing rational behavior sitting atop seas of chaotic instinct which will kill 30,000 people for the right to sell poison.  Or butcher two innocent white people with knives and bleach after raping BOTH SEXES for hours.</p>
<p>Science looks at prejudice and sees a flaw of psychoactive &#8216;substances&rsquo; effecting &#8216;higher order&rsquo; mental processes.  Rather than clarifying them with a neurotransmitter (dopamine like) reward process.</p>
<p>Race realists look at oxytocin and see both the reality of affinity group comfort.  And the potential for race preference doom.  If we can be scientifically &#8216;induced&rsquo; to feel the same way about other races as we do ourselves.  Or worse.  Denied the right to feel comfort within our own bond groups at all.</p>
<p>The curse of science and it&rsquo;s commercial sponsorship is always that of an ability to look for an outcome (to change and destroy a given standard) before the functional reason for any barrier to that outcome is itself comprehended.</p>
