			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), January 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The former rebel Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Movement cited its own estimates for the achievement which has to be officially confirmed by the South Sudan Referendum Commission that is organising the week-long vote.</p>
<p>But there were long queues at polling stations again on Wednesday as voters responded to calls from the party for a &#8220;100 per cent turnout&#8221;.</p>
<p>A referendum commission spokesman said the SPLM&rsquo;s claim was &#8220;quite possible. It could even be higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Voting is an honour to those who sacrificed their lives so we can have this choice today,&#8221; she said, referring to the devastating 1983-2005 civil war with the north in which an estimated two million people died.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a great opportunity that will not happen again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Loudspeaker trucks criss-crossed the potholed dirt tracks of Juba urging voters to respond to the call.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important that you go out to vote, have your cards with you. You have only three days more, freedom can&rsquo;t wait,&#8221; the hailers intoned to the accompaniment of loud African music.</p>
<p>The shine was taken off the party mood by the deaths of 10 southerners returning from the north for the referendum in an ambush by heavily armed Misseriya Arab tribesmen on Monday.</p>
<p>The attack was the latest incident in an upsurge of violence over Abyei, a disputed district on the north-south border where the nomadic Misseriya are engaged in bitter clashes with pro-southern Dinka farmers over the its future, which have claimed at least 33 lives since Friday.<br>

		<p>If at first you don&rsquo;t secede&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s amazing to me is how much support this secession vote got from the Hollywood Left and the State Department, and various Congressmen and Senators in foreign relations committees on both sides of The Hill.</p>
<p>Wonder where all this accommodation was in 1861?</p>
<p>One more thing:  We accepted a lot of Sudanese immigrants as legal immigrants in the 1990s and the last decade, the &ldquo;Lost Boys,&rdquo; in order to have refuge from (Muslim, shhh) Khartoum-sponsored violence.  Now that they have their own country, will they be made to go back?</p>

		<p>They are incapable of governing themselves. But they won&rsquo;t accept being governed by others. They are like drowning men clawing at the life raft. They will only capsize it and doom everyone else. Leave them to their squalor.</p>

		<p>This form of Separatism for defensive reasons is being viewed positively Here. Whereas, when White Ethnic Groups attempt to Separate it is viewed as Racist and Reactionary. This is what<br>

<p>Note how carefully no mention is made of the fact that these ambushes and &#8220;disputes&#8221; are planned and executed by muslims! MSM political correctness as usual, &#8220;Mustn&rsquo;t outrage the muslims&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;Does southern Sudan utilise slavery, or is that predominantly found in the north?&#8221;<br>
I have no doubt that the southern Sudanese practice intraracial slavery, whether or not it&rsquo;s strictly legal, because the law is more of a theoretical than a practical reality in most of Africa. However, the slavery practiced in Sudan that garnered international media attention was that practiced by the Arab-mulatto (think Anwar Sadat look-alikes) northerners against the almost pure black southerners. This is pretty much how East Africa functioned, of course, prior to European colonization, and that&rsquo;s what it has gone back to in the postcolonial era.</p>

<p>Except that there is nothing too squander and Sudan never had a common language, culture, religion or tribe with a majority anyway.</p>
<p>There really is nothing to lose, they are already at rock bottom.</p>

		<p>Nothing to squander is right.  I could probably spend the weekend looking for my house for something - anything - imported from the Sudan, but what would be the point?  I already know what I&rsquo;d find: zip.  The place is minerally rich, but I suspect official corruption and the miserable conditions created by the locals would make exploitation completely uneconomical.</p>
<p>As for wondering where all this accomodation was in 1861 here in the US, Question Diversity, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that while it was not OK for the south to secceed from the Union, it was just fine for West Virginia to secceed from Virginia.  We call that &#8220;hypocrisy&#8221; when anyone but government does it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ll get independence and squander everything once the tribes realize how artificial their anti-Arab unity truly is.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Highduke</p>
<p>Exactly.  According to the Wikipedia article, 133 different languages are spoken in the Sudan.  With that many languages in use, unity is going to last as long as a snowflake in&hellip; well, the Sudan.</p>
