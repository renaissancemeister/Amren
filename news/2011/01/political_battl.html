			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julia Preston, New York Times, December 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Legislative leaders in at least half a dozen states say they will propose bills similar to a controversial law to fight illegal immigration that was adopted by Arizona last spring, even though a federal court has suspended central provisions of that statute.</p>
<p>The efforts, led by Republicans, are part of a wave of state measures coming this year aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Legislators have also announced measures to limit access to public colleges and other benefits for illegal immigrants and to punish employers who hire them.</p>
<p>Next week, at least five states plan to begin an unusual coordinated effort to cancel automatic United States citizenship for children born in this country to illegal immigrant parents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the states expected to introduce bills similar to Arizona&rsquo;s are Georgia, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. </p>

		<p>Cracking down on the illegal invasion sounds good and is much needed. But just wait. Some judge will say &#8220;Nope&#8221; you can&rsquo;t do that. It happened in Arizona and will surely happen elsewhere. The people no longer have a say in what happens in this country. It&rsquo;s all up to he judges. It&rsquo;s not right but sadly it&rsquo;s a fact. </p>

		<p>Behind closed doors, politicians on every level are discussing what should be obvious to anyone who has a mind to track such things.</p>
<p>The US is very, VERY close to war with mexico.  Not so much the government nominally in charge (although rampant bribery makes that a moot point at best) but with the amerind population that makes up the drug trade.  These people want their own country and they want it to be a fascist narco-state.  And they intend to build it by taking territory in northern mexico and the southern US.  Most importantly, they intend to exterminate anyone who is not of an amerind racial background.</p>
<p>There are two types of politicians in the US&hellip;.those that fear this.  And those that think they can use the chaos of this war to completely convert the US over to communism and institute a slave state.  History has shown that all such states have failed immediately&hellip;.but they don&rsquo;t care.  They are &#8220;right this time&#8221;.</p>
<p>Everyone even remotely connected politically, knows all this&hellip;.and is preparing.  Specifically, these states are preparing to fight that war on their terms&hellip;..without large numbers of mestizos in their state that suddenly take up arms and run amok.</p>
<p>It is VERY important that YOU live somewhere like this.  If you don&rsquo;t, YOU will be on the front lines of that war.  If you live in a liberal bastion, the likelihood that YOU will die immediately is very high.</p>
<p>Better wake up&hellip;.better wake up NOW&hellip;..because there is little time left.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Next week, at least five states plan to begin an unusual coordinated effort to cancel automatic United States citizenship for children born in this country to illegal immigrant parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is one of the most inspirational and interesting things I have read about the unwanted alien invaders, in quite some time. It has the beginnings of a movement by the states, to reach out to each other and formally oppose that which is dictated from our Moscow on the Potomac. I am no lawyer, but it is possible that the states cannot override &ldquo;birthright US citizenship,&rdquo; per se; however, there is nothing stopping the states from shipping these &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; to the Washington DC area and demanding that they are never allowed to return to that state they are sent from. Moreover, if an agreement is reached among various states that these aliens and their offspring are not to be returned to any state in a pact of say &ldquo;quarantine from invasion,&rdquo; what can the Feds do? </p>
<p>Will they just ship them to dementedly &ldquo;immigrant friendly&rdquo; places like: California, Massachusetts, New York, Florida, Hawaii, and Minnesota; or will they suffer the consequences of having a serious secessionist movement and possibly another civil war, by trying to actually send them back to the states that have made such a pact? </p>
<p>4 or 5 states might be cowed and intimidated back into a union with the feds in such a scenario, but what about 45 of them?</p>
<p>That is something to really think about my good friends and Happy New Year,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>If the state leaders truly understand the dangers of immigration and are not just playing politics for short term gain, they&rsquo;ll have to take on the sociology professors. It&rsquo;s not just a few oddball academics, but the mainstream of the discipline teaches that immigration regulation is contrary to true human nature,  is unethical, and is based on false understandings of how society should operate. These professors have had decades of access to young people who have now become the establishment. This is an intolerable situation.</p>
<p>The state leaders have executive power. They could call for an academic conference on the theme of academic impediments to immigration reform. There are many academically trained civil servants who could be called to deliver papers. Another front in the attack would be to prepare a de-bunking book and send it out to every student who has ever taken a sociology course at a state university. These actions will stir things up and get people talking. It&rsquo;s time to shine a light into the dark corners of the sociology establishment.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Political Battle on Illegal Immigration Shifts to States&#8221;</p>
<p>The majority of the top trends analysts in the world are forecasting a global shift to anti-immigration, which is playing out in this country also, as we are seeing from the state legislatures.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve learned I believe they&rsquo;re going to be proven correct, but the shift will be too late to correct the explosiviveness third world hordes have brought to the societies they have migrated to in both the US and Europe, and civil upheaval will go hand in hand with austerity measures that are going to be forced on governments.</p>
<p>2011 will be an interesting year.</p>

		<p>The states could forbid doctors and hospitals from signing the certificates of birth in cases where the parents cannot unassailably prove American citizenship.</p>
<p>This would deny American birthrights to illegals without challenging the feds.  </p>

		<p>One thing not mentioned much in the &#8220;immigration&#8221; debate is the fact that our federal government is close to bankruptcy.  Think about this.  For decades the states have felt free to basically offer unlimited welfare and redistribution of income to non-whites in return for votes.  But they cannot do this with local money as raising taxes results in an almost total loss of the white voting block across all political backgrounds.  White hypocrisy is beyond thick with this as liberals vote for unlimited spending on non-whites but freak out at even a whisper that they should pay for it.  Federal funds allows them to diffuse the responsibility for this and let others pay for their bad behavior.</p>
<p>But the federal government has been mismanaged to the point of collapse.  This is no joke as I expect the next &#8220;budget&#8221; to NOT be passed and suspect the federal reserve might simply refuse to give the federal government more than a token allowance.  That will mean a severe contraction of federal spending and the possible, even probable interruption of ALL federal spending for an unknowable period of time.</p>
<p>What will the states do?  How will whites react, especially when non-whites respond with widespread violence?</p>

<p>Interesting what you say about doctors and hospitals playing their part by requesting identification.  I like your idea but can&rsquo;t see it working.  Medical professionals and their mandarins are some of the biggest pro-diversity, left wing cheerleaders you will find.  By the way have you noticed how &#8216;diversified&rsquo; hospitals are these days?  </p>
<p>The white race&rsquo;s biggest enemy is its own so called intelligentsia.  </p>

		<p>No one seems to mention tha phrase that settles it for me &hellip; &#8220;under the jurisdiction of&hellip;&#8221; Mexicans nor illegals from any other country are under the jurisdiction of the US. Why shouldn&rsquo;t those few words alone be enough to send &#8216;em packing? The 14th amendment has been misinterpreted for years. It&rsquo;s time it was corrected. I realize it will be a big fight to get it done. Our country is filled with those who, for their own reasons, welcome the invasion. They profit in some way by filling our country with people who drain our economy while America taxpayers have to ante up for their upkeep while they send their money home. There is something dreadfully wrong with this picture.</p>

		<p>Why is the Arizona law always characterized by the liberal press as controversial? The law allows an official to ask for documentation of citizenship or legal resident status on reasonable suspicion that the individual is an illegal alien. A &#8220;Terry Stop&#8221; which is what the Arizons law is, allows a police officer, on reasonable suspicion, to stop an individual, check identification and pat down for weapons. This is settled law by Supreme Court decision. If you drive, you can be stopped and asked to display your driver&rsquo;s license. If you enter the US or a foreign country you are asked for your passport. If you open a bank account you must provide personal information including I.D., social security number, address, and other information. If you are stopped at a DUI traffic checkpoint you can be requested to take a breathalizer test as well as show your license. How many places does one go, how many times is it necessary or requested that one show I.D.? The aliens object to this law for the same reason a bank robber objects to laws against bank robbery. Being in the country illegally is obviously a crime. Obviously if there is a suspicion that the individual does not have legal status to be in the country, it is reasonable to stop and question the subject, and to check I.D. and other documentation. I don&rsquo;t understand the straw man arguments of &#8220;profiling&#8221; or &#8220;intimidation&#8221;. I have recently traveled on business and at each airport have been required to show valid I.D. and have been searched and my belongings searched. I don&rsquo;t mind. Why is it so objectionable if you are required to have bona fide I.D. to show it upon request? Janet Napolitano has no problem with travelers at airports having their groins patted down, why does she have a problem with mestizos showing I.D.? When I went to Germany they inspected and stamped my passport. The hotel inspected my passport. The car rental company inspected my passport. I didn&rsquo;t feel profiled. It&rsquo;s time to identify, arrest and deport ALL illegal aliens. And vote out the pandering politicians that won&rsquo;t get it done.</p>

		<p>Obfuscation designed to distance Washington from the fight and thus dim the appearance of doing nothing to &#8216;doing something, somewhere else&rsquo;, which is doomed to judicial override -from Washington-, where all executive branch has control over the appointment of judges and the corporate Congress passes it&rsquo;s okay on everything that enables universalism or big business.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Opponents say that effort would be unconstitutional, arguing that the power to grant citizenship resides with the federal government, not with the states. Still, the chances of passing many of these measures appear better than at any time since 2006, when many states, frustrated with inaction in Washington, began proposing initiatives to curb illegal immigration. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>See, it sounds good but what this is really saying is that the masses are not angry enough to act as a group and so can be divided and conquered at the micro level.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Republicans gained more than 690 seats in state legislatures nationwide in the November midterms, winning their strongest representation at the state level in more than 80 years. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>&#8216;Gaining seats&rsquo; is the same thing as gaining vested interests.  It is infiltration by corporate and leftist agent provocateurs whose sole goal is to prevent -any- unified action which is not corrupted by accomodation.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Few people expect movement on immigration issues when Congress reconvenes next week in a divided Washington. Republicans, who will control the House of Representatives, do not support an overhaul of immigration laws that President Obama has promised to continue to push. State lawmakers say it has fallen to them to act. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Obama got his tax bill, the rest is just a waiting game until the attention span switches to a new crisis, even if it has to be manufactured.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&ldquo;The federal government&rsquo;s failure to enforce our border has functionally turned every state into a border state,&rdquo; said Randy Terrill, a Republican representative in Oklahoma who has led the drive for anti-illegal immigration laws there. &ldquo;This is federalism in action,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The states are stepping in and filling the void left by the federal government.&rdquo; <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Which tells you The Feds are not conforming to their designated role as protectors of this nation and thus are not beholden to it&rsquo;s loyalties but to someone else&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
But the proposals have already drawn opposition from some business groups. And they are forcing strategic soul-searching within the Republican Party nationwide, with a rising populist base on one side demanding tough immigration measures, and, on the other side, traditional Republican supporters in business and a fast-growing Latino electorate strongly opposing those measures. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>See.  Culture of Critique in action.  Add doubts.  Voice dissent.  Decry a lack of empathy.  Delay, delay, delay, forget why you are fighting.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
In Utah, a state dominated by Republicans, leaders from business, law enforcement, several churches and the Latino community sought to bridge the divide by joining together in November in a compact urging moderation on immigration issues. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>If  you can&rsquo;t swing one majority, swing many minorities, all nameless and faceless to public view.  All lectured and given marching orders behind closed doors, making a mockery of separation of powers.  Consensus = Conspiracy.  Compromise = Corruption.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&ldquo;States will push ahead regardless of the Ninth Circuit,&rdquo; said Kris Kobach, a law professor and politician from Kansas who helped many states devise immigration laws  &mdash;  including Arizona&rsquo;s. &ldquo;A lot of people recognize that the district judge&rsquo;s decision is very much open to dispute.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>In Kansas, Republicans won big majorities in both legislative houses and Sam Brownback, who just retired as a United States senator, was elected governor. Mr. Kobach, the law professor, was elected secretary of state after a campaign in which he vowed to pass a law requiring proof of citizenship for voters. </p>
<p>But the Kansas Chamber of Commerce has voiced its opposition, and Mr. Brownback has said he will focus on reducing unemployment. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Bought and paid for.  Says one thing to get elected _because he&rsquo;s told to_ and then acts against it, once in office.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The newest initiative is a joint effort among lawmakers from states including Arizona, Oklahoma, Missouri and Pennsylvania to pass laws based on a single model that would deny American citizenship to children born in those states to illegal immigrants. The legislators were to announce the campaign in Washington on Wednesday. </p>
<p>A leader of that effort is Daryl Metcalfe, a Republican state representative from Pennsylvania. At a recent news conference, Mr. Metcalfe said his goal was to eliminate &ldquo;an anchor baby status, in which an illegal alien invader comes into our country and has a child on our soil that is granted citizenship automatically.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The campaign is certain to run into legal obstacles. Courts have interpreted the 14th Amendment as guaranteeing birthright citizenship. Even among those who seek its repeal, debate has hinged on whether that would require a constitutional amendment, an act of Congress or a decision by the Supreme Court. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>If &#8216;think global, act local&rsquo; works, it will be defeated at the Federal level.  And the last time someone decided to play anti-federalist, 600,000 men died and The South was raped by powermad centrists.</p>
<p>But the key factor here is the that longer you play the game &#8216;within the system&rsquo; the less your final choice matters because promises-promises focus the struggle towards a solution in a system that is _not designed_ to support the choice of the people who wish it.</p>
<p>Declare separation and watch the troops come streaming home from abroad with ADS and tear gas to &#8216;break up the xenophobic racists&rsquo;.  After years of practice on Iraqis and Afghans to harden them to the evil of their actions.</p>
<p>But still, it is better to declare separation while there is still a chance than it is to defend &#8216;the system&rsquo; until there is none.  At least if you _have a goal_ that is worth putting everyone behind, will it or no, you don&rsquo;t have to look at a death by 1,000 cuts scenario.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Some Republicans argue that the party is risking losing its appeal to Latino voters, the fastest-growing minority voter bloc. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And we know that gaining or losing 5-10% of voter block is useless and will remain so until there are so many Hispanics that the GOP start to pander to them directly, as the Democrats now do.</p>
<p>The difference, and it is a critical one, is that the Republican Voters and the Republican Party are no longer considered one and the same.  The GOP does not respect the 60% of whites it considers to be it&rsquo;s &#8216;rightful&rsquo; (by God ordained) base.  And Republicans are tired of being called racists for a party that _does not defend the race_.  However politely you put it as &#8216;class, tax block or family oriented conservatism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Dump the GOP.  Declare radical solutions and pick out the strongest critics as those who are not with you because they are not with you rather than because they do or do not represent a fully infiltrated and corrupted party organization.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&ldquo;The Republican Party is divided between those who see that Hispanics are an essential constituency going forward, and those who don&rsquo;t see that,&rdquo; said Tamar Jacoby, a Republican who is the president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a business coalition that supports legalization for illegal immigrants. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Nobody in the Republican party sees anything but this: $$$$.  Everyone knows the U.S. is a sinking ship and when it gets bad enough they want to have enough of this: $$$$ to fade away to wealthy enclaves where racism is a function of taxable income.</p>
<p>When the hispanics are numerous and young enough at 3-4 TFR, beginning by 15, they will overwhelm this nation&rsquo;s political establishment and no amount of pandering to them will matter.  The supranationalist megacorps will be safe because they will live and work in industrial compounds anywhere and everywhere, abroad.</p>
<p>The politicians hope their money alone will be enough to buy insulation, once their job-classification is obsolete as rulers of individual nations.</p>
<p>That leaves only _us_.  Who have to have land to have a racial hope of surviving in.  Because we still apart from our inferiors.  We still guard the dream of our children&rsquo;s children finding mates that are of superior genetics to continue our culture in the meltdown.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Latino and immigrant advocate groups are resigned to being on the defensive for the next two years. &ldquo;These laws are creating resentment within the Latino community that is going to last for decades,&rdquo; said Tony Yapias, director of Proyecto Latino de Utah in Salt Lake City, an immigrant advocacy group. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>This should not concern us beyond the amount of firepower it will take to evict them when denial of entitlements isn&rsquo;t fast enough to rid us of a 5th column at our backs as the Feds come charging down our fronts.  We cannot create ethnostates based on a 2-front policy of appeasing those who would replace us in the long run anyway.  Hitler tried it and killed Germany in the wastes of the Russian steppes.  We have only a little &#8216;lebensraum&rsquo; and cannot move to a new land in a world filled with the uncivilized, dependent and criminal.</p>
<p>This is why fighting within the system to control our society from the inside is a doomed effort.  As the Texas Rancher story a couple days ago made clear, they will _come anyway_.  And if they are at all present, someone will justify our exploitation based on pity for their criminality.</p>
<p>We must have BOTH safe borders AND a separate means of self-rule.  And secession grants each at once rather than by half-measure hoping to stumble into one as a consequence of the other.</p>
<p>NEITHER WILL BE &#8216;GIVEN&rsquo; TO US BY OUR MASTERS IN WASHINGTON D.C..</p>
<p>Because they are not working for us anymore.  They haven&rsquo;t been for a very, very, long time.</p>
<p>Secession and Revolution are the only choices left.  Anything else is specious distraction.</p>
