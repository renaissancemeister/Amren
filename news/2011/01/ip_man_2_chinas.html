<h1>&#8220;Ip Man 2&#8221;: China&rsquo;s Anti-Western Kung Fu Phenomenon</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew O&rsquo;Hehir, Salon, January 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chinese action star Donnie Yen and director Wilson Yip breathed prodigious new life into the martial-arts genre with their quasi-biographical 2008 film &#8220;Ip Man,&#8221; a huge hit on multiple continents. {snip}<br>
Yip and screenwriter Edmond Wong stick closely to the winning blend of nationalist agitprop, colorful melodrama and epic fight choreography (again by the great Sammo Hung) from the first film, and despite its flat and trite portrayals of Western characters  &mdash;  referred to repeatedly as &#8220;foreign devils&#8221;  &mdash;  &#8220;Ip Man 2&#8221; is nearly as enjoyable as the original. Its not-so-secret weapon is the poised, calm performance of Yen, who somehow manages to play Ip as both character and archetype. He kicks ass in all directions, taking on street thugs, rival Hong Kong masters and an arrogant English boxer, all while embodying Confucian-Buddhist ideals of modesty, balance, honor and selflessness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to read &#8220;Ip Man 2&#8221; in the context of contemporary East-West relations, in fact. Wong&rsquo;s screenplay uniformly depicts British characters (portrayed, as usual, by an erratic assortment of multinational white people) as vain, cruel, arrogant and bigoted, at least until the last minute or so of the movie, when Ip&rsquo;s final plea for cooperation and tolerance is greeted by a standing ovation from Europeans. (All of this, arguably, is pretty minor payback for Hollywood&rsquo;s treatment of Asians over the years.) {snip}<br>

<p>Which &#8216;treatment&rsquo; might that be, Andrew?  Is it Hollywood&rsquo;s portrayal of the Japanese in response to their murderous aggression in Asia and Oceania during the 1930s and 40s?  Is it Hollywood&rsquo;s portrayal of ethnic Chinese in response to China&rsquo;s brutal treatment of the Tibetans and Koreans during the 1950s?  Let&rsquo;s not also forget it was China that bankrolled the genocidal regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, Andy, it is arguable.</p>

		<p>I dated a Chinese national some 30 years ago, when in college.It was explained to me the term foreign devil ( pronounced gwai low in Chinese) was a very derogatory term for white people. That this should be in a movie is as bad as the &#8220;N&#8221; word for blacks, or slurs for Chinese. But, because we are white, what do you think the chances are that anything will done against the movie makers? I think we know the answer to that question.</p>

<p>Yes, whites invented racism, and this evil racism continues up until whatever day it happens to be, while all unending noble sufferers (people of color) have never before had even a single racist thought, up until whatever day the article in question has come out. Yes, I think I&rsquo;ve figured out the context within which these articles must all be written. I&rsquo;m not a spring chicken. </p>

		<p>As a little boy I enjoyed the series &#8216;Kung-Fu&rsquo; starring David Carradine and Phillip Ahn.  It depicted a Chinese (actually he was half-White) shaolin priest who murders the Emperor&rsquo;s son and flees to the U.S.  It was depicted in the American West of the mid 1800&rsquo;s.  Everywhere Quai Chang Caine went he met nothing but bad and evil White men, whom he regularly easily beat up with his &#8216;Kung-Fu&rsquo;.  White men were usually depicted as evil &#8216;racists&rsquo; who didn&rsquo;t like Orientals.  At the time I had no real knowledge of the media and it&rsquo;s continuing depiction of White men in the negative.  It was only many years later after many, many examples of media depictions of White men that I began to analyze the media&rsquo;s portrayal of White&rsquo;s down through the decades.  There&rsquo;s no doubt that the image of White&rsquo;s as portrayed in movies, sitcoms, TV shows, commercials, advertisements, company websites, etc. is getting worse and worse all the time.  And it&rsquo;s been a continuous agenda down through the years.  Even back in the 1950&rsquo;s with such wholesome shows as &#8216;Leave it to Beaver&rsquo;, &#8216;The Rifleman&rsquo;, &rsquo; My Three Son&rsquo;s&rsquo; and lots of others, I&rsquo;ve noticed things that I never noticed before, and I&rsquo;ve watched the progression every decade.  The progression has gotten progressively worse.  Now we&rsquo;re at the point where I think it&rsquo;s getting quite obvious that there is truly an agenda to defame Whites and depict them in the worst light.  Hopefully others are seeing this as well.</p>

<p>All that is creating attitude in young Chinese, who will meet more whites than most Chinese ever have before.  As Chinese buy up the lots of foreclosed homes here and become the new slumlords, this &#8220;pretty minor payback&#8221; will be manifest.</p>

		<p>I could never watch a Bruce Lee movie through its entirety.  His catawalling squeals were hilarious as the dubbed in swishing sounds for speeding hands.  No matter how fast you move your hands, the basic physics formula is that Force = Mass times velocity.  With as little mass as Bruce Lee or most Chinese possess, they would have to move their hands near the speed of light to cause their victims to fly off the way they depict them, let alone knock them over.  Also, Chinese have delicate jaws, a punch from a middle weight, average white boxer would know them out, and likely break their jaw.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more hokum in Chinese culture and Barnum and Bailey ever could have created in a thousand years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they hate us so much.</p>

		<p>Having seen the first Ip Man, I think this White hating liberal is reading too much into this movie. This is a period piece, set in the 1940s. The first film was about Chinese nationalism and anti-Japanese sentiment. The Chinese hold a lot of resentment about once being considered the &#8220;sick man of Asia.&#8221; This film is a sort of Chinese revisionism, where the Chinese paint themselves as much more noble and civilized than they were at that time. It&rsquo;s a movie that aims to put a positive image out there about Chinese. Its mainly aimed at the Chinese themselves, but I&rsquo;m sure they hope to get that message to others as well. It&rsquo;s hypocritical for us to object to this, because I think we all would appreciate similar propagandist movies about Whites.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m not surprised because as the power of whites&rsquo; declines, there will be more minority pile ones. It will be like hyenas attacking a wounded lion. Our arrogant, stupid and effete elites don&rsquo;t seem to realize that as whites decline other aggressive ethnocentric racial groups (Latinos, East Asians) will fill the American power vacuum. It&rsquo;s within their interest to do so. The white liberal power structure will crumple into dust.  </p>

<p>Yes, because only whites were mean to asians and it was NEVER called for, right?  I mean, Asians never harmed whites nor were Asians harmed by blacks or hispanics and it&rsquo;s certainly not as if Asians think they are superior to other groups, right?</p>

<p>The show was incredibly brazen in it&rsquo;s depiction of whites and westerners. So much so it&rsquo;s probably why the reruns no longer come on. Some of the depiction of whites as greedy, cowardly, small-minded and ignorant may have been based on a bit of truth. It was an interesting look at another way of life and this hero&rsquo;s life. At least I liked it as a kid too. Some of this degradation of whites that continues up to this day on the shows and the commercials, where the white male character is a bumbler and has to be helped out by women or people of color may be a kind of reverse psychology. There&rsquo;s something to this, &#8216;show positive imagines of people&rsquo; attitude, of the politically correct crowd. TV is about showing a vision of how things should be. Except for whites, where it&rsquo;s Ok to show them as bumbling stumbling, or always the bad guy in the show, except for the hero character if they are white. The most insidious aspect of TV and the movies right now is their always pairing up an average looking white guy with one of the most beautiful females in the world almost every time. White men grow up internalizing a mismatched standard for a girlfriend.  </p>

		<p>When you think of the way the British treated the Chinese it&rsquo;s easy to understand the term &#8220;foreign devils&#8221;. </p>
<p>In the early 19th century the British were the world biggest drug dealers. They unloaded whole ship loads of opium in China which was against Chinese law and used their military to protect the drug trade which was referred to back home as the tea trade. </p>
<p>I have nothing against the Chinese beause they to have a very old and impressive civilization. </p>

		<p>&#8220;it&rsquo;s Ok to show them (whites) as bumbling stumbling, or always the bad guy in the show, except for the hero character if they are white&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the past a character was a hero because he or she stood up for what is right and true. Nowadays a character is a hero on TV because they stand up for what is liberal and untrue? And if they stand up for non-whites on the show in the proper way or are viewed favorably by people of color.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A hero like the Lone Ranger used to have a code to live by:</p>
<p>The Lone Ranger never uses slang or colloquial phrases, but instead uses perfect grammar and precise speech completely devoid of slang and colloquial phrases at all times.</p>
<p>When he has to use guns, The Lone Ranger never shoots to kill, but rather only to disarm his opponent as painlessly as possible.</p>
<p>Logically, too, The Lone Ranger never wins against hopeless odds; i.e., he is never seen escaping from a barrage of bullets merely by riding into the horizon.</p>
<p>Even though The Lone Ranger offers his aid to individuals or <br>
small groups, the ultimate objective of his story never fails to imply that their benefit is only a by-product of a greater achievement &mdash; the development of the west or our country. His adversaries are usually groups whose power is such that large areas are at stake.</p>
<p>Adversaries are never other than American to avoid criticism from minority groups.</p>
<p>Names of unsympathetic characters are carefully chosen, never consisting of two names if it can be avoided, to avoid even further vicarious association  &mdash;  more often than not, a single nickname is selected.</p>
<p>The Lone Ranger never drinks or smokes, and saloon scenes are usually interpreted as cafes, with waiters and food instead of bartenders and liquor.</p>
<p>Criminals are never shown in enviable positions of wealth or power, and they never appear as successful or glamorous.</p>

My how TV and society has changed. </p>

		<p>I, too, grew up watching &#8220;Kung Fu&#8221;, and noticed very early on how whites were portrayed. I began to dislike television shows, quite early in my life. What they portrayed seemed so false, nothing like the real world in which I lived.The values were sleezy, false, or unrealistic. By the time I was in high school, I was pretty much done watching television. The same can be said for pop music. Yeah, I got left out quite a bit because I wasn&rsquo;t listening to the lastest rock stars, but so what. I never thought much of what I heard or saw people doing. I never understood how people could buy into it, adopt it as an image and a lifestyle.Remember all that back in the 1970&rsquo;s? Now, with rap music, and very sleezy &#8220;dance&#8221; music, I am even more confused. How could anyone, esp. a white person, let their child emulate the values and look found in those sorts of &#8220;entertainment&#8221; and &#8220;music&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Just like Hollywood, the Chinese don&rsquo;t do movies, the do propaganda. The shallow explanation is that after the whites have built the Chinese industry, they aren&rsquo;t necessary anymore. There is surely more to it but why dig into the smelly pit of entertainment when we have no other industry? The important part is that we have been economically conquered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into prejudice, but the as Roman saying goes &#8220;Woe to the conquered&#8221;&hellip; it&rsquo;s an equal opportunity thing.<br>

		<p>Poster #9 has the right of it.  Foreign devil was the common expression at the time and reflected the sentiment that Westerners had no business in China.  They no more would want whites changing their culture than we want Chinese, Hispanics or Africans changing ours.  Why do posters here get indignant about the very thing that&rsquo;s preached on this site day to day: that diversity is not strength.  Let the Chinese have their culture in their country, and speak how they like about others while we strive reclaim ours.  I&rsquo;m sure no one here has any doubt that the horde of immigrants here (legal and otherwise), are nothing more than just what the Chinese called us: foreign devils.  How many times has anyone here spoken or thought of them as &#8220;damned foreigners&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Ip Man was actually quite a remarkable character.  I learned a lot about him when I studied the martial art he almost single-handedly saved from obscurity.</p>
<p>I can say also that the British in particular were pretty arrogant when they were administering their &#8216;zone&rsquo; of influence in China back then.  </p>
<p>In the &#8220;Kung Fu&#8221; series, it was a bit overdone, the anti-white stuff, but I would venture to say that chinese people in the late 1800s DID have some bad experiences from the locals (us) and that America should have not let them in to protect them from macho cowboys.</p>

		<p>A real life version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is playing out.  The names Donnie (nickname of Donald), Wilson and Edmond originate from the British Isles.  The British in this Ip Man 2 film are portrayed as vain yet the main actor &#8220;Donnie&#8221; Yen is the one that has had plastic surgeries on his eye lids and nose to look more like a white man.  All respected males in East Asian cultures were fat unlike in European cultures where valiant and respected men were depicted as muscular.  That is another thing the Chinese have taken in this Ip Man 2 film.  East Asians want everyone to believe that Europeans did something to them to make them xenophobic when in reality they have always been that way to anyone not of East Asian background.  Andrew O&rsquo;Hehir perpetuates lies to continue this guilt white people train to cast white people as bad and non-white people as angels.</p>

<p>I think many in this Internet forum should be reminded that if an Asian person did something extraordinary, then that person shall be depicted in a movie as a Caucasian character.</p>
<p>&#8220;Extraordinary Measures&#8221;: Harrison Ford as Dr. Stonehill (Dr. Chen in real life)</p>
<p>&#8220;21&#8221;: Nearly the entire cast were Caucasians.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Last Airbender&#8221;: ditto.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Mr. Wong&#8221; series: Boris Karloff as Mr. Wong.  (I actually liked his portrayal)</p>

<p>I knew the media does this to women, many of them looking for that Alpha male.  I wasn&rsquo;t aware that it worked in reverse too.  I guess this way they can cut down on the number of marriages of both White men and women and thereby cut down on the number of White children, thereby reducing our numbers even faster.

<p>How could anyone, esp. a white person, let their child emulate the values and look found in those sorts of &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; and &ldquo;music&rdquo;?</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>I think I can answer that.  As a boy and teenager I was affected by the TV as most people are.  I was never the lemming-type though.  Never followed the herd just for the sake of it.  Looking back now I realize that most people are lemming-like.  They follow the crowd simply to be like the crowd.  And the desire to be like everyone else overrides intelligence in most people.  As far as emulation goes, I&rsquo;ve realized that some youth will never emulate this pop culture, but that is far and away the exception.  Most kids will buy into this simply because of the same media conditioning that I mentioned earlier in my post about the &#8216;Kung-Fu&rsquo; series.  Their desire to be like what they perceive everyone else to be like and to actually like what they think everyone else likes overrides intelligence and logic.  That is probably the main reason.  Still another reason is that they were never exposed to the past; they&rsquo;re not old enough to remember anything better.  They have to age first and learn about the past.  And speaking of the past, this is another thing the media wants to separate our youth from.  They want our youth to be rootless, race-less cosmopolitans without meaning or purpose in life.  Thought-less automatons. </p>

		<p>For those who do not know, Bruce Lee was Yip Man´s favourite student. Tales about their falling out are numerous, but from what I gather Yip regarded his going to Hollywood as a desecration of the art (having seen a few of his films, I tend to agree). It is also said that when Yip refused to sell him the wooden dummy, Lee challenged him to a fight and got badly beaten up.<br>
- I attended university with one of Yip´s original students &hellip; he must have been quite a personality; shortly before getting his master´s said colleague declared that no, he was going back to his master.<br>
- The style is Wing Chun (lit: &#8220;shining spring&#8221;), developed by a woman, a middle between the &#8220;outer&#8221; (say, Chung Pai i.e. &#8220;heavy fist&#8221; or Shaolin Pai) and the &#8220;inner&#8221; (e.g. Tai Chi) forms. It relies on protecting the centerline and utilizing the enemy´s strength against him; a very elegant concept - though I doubt a European can fully understand it.</p>
<p>So, if the Chinese want to exalt Yip Man, that´s OK with me; being called names I am used to.</p>

		<p>Saw the flick.  Good action.  Cliché story.  Not based on the story of the real Master Ip.  But hey, &#8220;Asian action heroes beating white guys silly&#8221; is a rare exception.  It is almost always the white hero who saves the day and gets the women everywhere else.  Come on, please don&rsquo;t insist on white supremacy in everything.</p>

<p>I agree. I thank God that I was raised with one grandmother in the home,and the other elderly relatives nearby. They gave me quite a sense of the past, and where I came from and what to value. They looked down on the popular &#8220;entertainment&#8221; of the day, and gave me a sense of being rooted in a culture,and one better than what was presented on the television. This may be why I had the sense to stand up against all the childish nonsense, questionable values and behavior and mindless consumerism I saw going on around me by young folk and even by many adults who should have known better.<br>
 <br>
Interesting that in the &#8220;entertainment&#8221; media, older people, our elders, are portrayed as pathetic, out of touch, ignorant, mean-spirited, stupid, and that being conservative on some things is presented as bad, or backward.Older folks -make that WHITE older folks- and the past are always shown in a negative light.Youthful indiscretion and cockiness and rudeness is presented as hip and desirable. Pay very close attention when you watch television, movies and especially commercials and see if you don&rsquo;t see this as well.</p>
<p>In my opinion, they do this because they want to destroy any link to our past, to our older folk and to our values and culture. Yes,you are correct.They want us without roots, without thoughts or values of our own. </p>

		<p>Re: the TV series &#8220;Kung Fu&#8221;, some people here are trying to make out that Kwai Chang Caine (strangely un-Chinese name) would never have encountered so many obnoxious and aggressive white men in reality.  Pur-lease!  May I remind you of the phrases &#8220;bonded labour&#8221;, &#8220;Chinese Exclusion Act&#8221;, &#8220;Yellow Peril&#8221; and &#8220;Chinaman&rsquo;s chance&#8221;, which sufficiently demonstrate the attitude of white America to the Chinese.  It certainly isn&rsquo;t the case that an unaccompanied, unarmed Chinese man carrying a flute would have been able to walk unmolested from one side of the US to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;With as little mass as Bruce Lee or most Chinese possess, they would have to move their hands near the speed of light to cause their victims to fly off the way they depict them, let alone knock them over. Also, Chinese have delicate jaws, a punch from a middle weight, average white boxer would know them out, and likely break their jaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, yet it&rsquo;s hilarious how many dopes believe this hogwash.  After all - &#8220;It must be true; it&rsquo;s on the TV!&#8221;</p>
<p>I grew up during the heyday of Bruce Lee on the big screen.  How many brainwashed fools touted him as some sort of superman.  They would go almost apoplexic when I explained to them how Chuck Norris would have beaten him in a competition.  Aside from being signficantly larger in size than Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris was the holder of the Professional Middleweight karate champion title six years straight.  Bruce Lee never competed professionally.</p>
<p>It really is amazing the power the big and small screens possess to short-circuit common sense in human beings.  Witness for the prosecution.</p>

<p>Anyone who knows anything about biophysics knows that in the real world, if those large, hulking, protein-fed Vikings had landed in feudal Japan, they would have rolled over those diminuitive, rice-fed Samurai.  Size matters!<br>

<p>Assuming they weren&rsquo;t shot down, as it&rsquo;s already been established that Viking metallurgy was not at all up to par with Japanese.</p>
