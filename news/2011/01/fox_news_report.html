			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cliff Kincaid, Accuracy in Media, January 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An alleged Department of Homeland Security memo saying that Arizona shooter Jared Loughner was influenced by American Renaissance (AR), a controversial conservative publication, does not exist and there is no evidence of such a tie.</p>
<p>A Fox News report by Jennifer Griffin on the memo about AR suggested official inside information at the highest levels of the Obama Administration that Loughner was motivated to assassinate Rep. Gabrielle Giffords because she was Jewish and because of the immigration controversy in Arizona.</p>
<p>While many liberal commentators recklessly tried to link the shootings to Sarah Palin, the Tea Party, or other conservatives, the Griffin report on Fox News seemed to give official credence to the notion that conservatism was a factor motivating Jared Loughner.</p>
<p>For this reason, the report, which prompted a bomb threat and hate mail against American Renaissance, was seized upon by dozens of media organizations and left-wing websites such as Media Matters and the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>
<p>Politico, which was among many news organizations publicizing the erroneous Fox News story, has now reported that the document in question came from the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center (ACTIC) and not DHS. Politico said that David Denlinger, identified as a commander of ACTIC, acknowledged that it &#8220;contained errors and overstated the link&#8221; between Loughner and American Renaissance.</p>
<p>In fact, Denlinger has no evidence of a link.</p>
<p>As AIM was the first to report, the contents of the alleged memo were characterized by false claims and erroneous information. Simple research showed no evidence in Loughner&rsquo;s Internet writings or videos which displayed any link to or awareness of American Renaissance.</p>
<p>Instead, his behavior was strongly suggestive of paranoid schizophrenia and drug abuse.</p>
<p>Adding to this evidence, Loughner friend Zachary Osler is quoted by ABC News as saying that he spent &#8220;excessive amounts of money&#8221; on drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, psilocybin mushrooms and the hallucinogenic salvia.</p>
<p>ACTIC is also known as the Arizona Fusion Center, &#8220;a joint effort between the Department of Public Safety, Arizona Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation and other participating agencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Denlinger said the memo was written by two people he did not name and that he has &#8220;no reason to believe&#8221; that Loughner &#8220;had any direct connection or was being directed by American Renaissance.&#8221; He said the two people had &#8220;put a quick summary together for their bosses in terms of here are some of the things that are being looked at right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is still unclear where the erroneous information came from. But suspicions would naturally fall on left-wingers anxious to smear conservatives and tie them to the shootings by using an &#8220;official&#8221; source.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor of American Renaissance told AIM that ACTIC phoned him &#8220;to try to explain what happened&#8221; but that they are &#8220;still not certain just what prompted someone to tie the killer to us&hellip;&#8221; Taylor was also told that ACTIC does not have a file on AR.</p>
<p>While it is now reporting the truth about the fake memo, Politico had given credence to the Fox News story and even suggested a Tea Party connection to the shootings. &#8220;The group&rsquo;s website features what appear to be paid advertisements for tea party versions of the &#8216;Don&rsquo;t tread on me&rsquo; flag,&rsquo;&#8221; Politico reported. This added fuel to the charge that conservatives were behind the shootings.</p>
<p>The Politico story by Maggie Haberman and Carrie Budoff Brown ran under the false headline, &#8220;DHS probing shooter&rsquo;s ties to hate group.&#8221; It quoted the Southern Poverty Law Center, a discredited organization recently condemned for labeling the respected Family Research Council as a hate group.</p>
<p>A controversial right-wing publication, AR publishes articles criticizing racial preference and &#8220;diversity&#8221; programs that favor minority groups at the expense of majority rights. It also examines racial differences, a taboo subject for much of the media that gives rise to frequent leftist charges of &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jared Taylor had told AIM that a review of the records of American Renaissance showed no indication that Loughner was ever involved in any way with the publication or its conferences. He said the memo demonstrated that those charged with protecting America are at the very least incompetent. &#8220;If this is the level of research we are getting from DHS, then Heaven help us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Apparently using the bogus Griffin story as his source, Fox News commentator Juan Williams had cited the alleged tie between Loughner and AR on the Fox News Sunday show. AR&rsquo;s denial of the charges to Fox News correspondent James Rosen was posted on the Fox News website  &mdash;  but only after Juan Williams regurgitated the Griffin report. Griffin had never sought a response from AR.</p>
<p>Two days after the original Griffin report, Fox News correspondent James Rosen acknowledged on the air there was no such DHS memo or evidence.</p>
<p>In response to the latest explanation of where the phony information came from, Taylor told AIM, &#8220;We are tremendously relieved that the truth is finally coming out, namely, that the initial reports about us got it all wrong. It was obvious from the start that the memo was something someone scratched out in a hurry and was never intended for the public. Fox should have been more skeptical of it, but several Fox correspondents passed the nonsense along verbatim. At least James Rosen thought to check with us before he went on the air. Hats off to him for that. After being deluged with hate mail and a bomb threat, we look forward to getting back to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, left-wing publications eager to blame conservatives for the shooting of a Democratic Representative had found themselves jumping in bed with their ordinary nemesis Fox News.</p>
<p>The George Soros-funded blog Think Progress asserted, without any basis in fact, that Loughner &#8220;may have ties to the anti-government and anti-Semitic American Renaissance website.&#8221; For the record, American Renaissance is neither anti-government nor anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>The Soros-funded Media Matters, which usually treats information from Fox News with ridicule, jumped on the report, running items on its &#8220;research&#8221; page under the headlines, &#8220;Law Enforcement Memo Links Arizona Assassin To &#8216;Anti-Immigration&rsquo; American Renaissance,&#8221; and &#8220;Memo: Loughner &#8216;Possibly Linked&rsquo; To &#8216;Anti Immigration&rsquo; American Renaissance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, which claims to ferret out &#8220;hate groups,&#8221; described the document cited by Fox News as &#8220;a leaked DHS memo.&#8221; This ran under a &#8220;Hatewatch&#8221; headline and was linked to an item on Fox News host Greta Van Susteren&rsquo;s blog about the original Griffin report.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an internal memo obtained by Fox News put out by DHS compiling facts known so far about the case,&#8221; Van Susteren&rsquo;s blog reported, citing Griffin.</p>
<p>In fact, as we now know, there was no such official DHS document.</p>
<p>After AIM raised questions about the report, a Washington Post blogger by the name of Greg Sargent published a report noting that DHS denied having any such memo or any evidence of any such link. He reported, &#8220;The Fox report caused a splash, with some news orgs reporting that anonymous officials had confirmed such possible ties. Some conservatives railed at DHS for supposedly trying to tie the shooter to the right for political reasons, and others disputed the suggestion that this displayed the shooter&rsquo;s ideological leanings. But DHS has not officially provided any such information to any law enforcement officials, the DHS official says.&#8221;</p>
<p>The official told him, &#8220;We have not established any such possible link.&#8221;</p>
<p>The New York Times said, &#8220;Officials at the Homeland Security department said Sunday morning they do not believe the document is from their department.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a follow-up story on the official debunking of the memo, Sargent says, &#8220;it&rsquo;s really surprising people weren&rsquo;t a bit more cautious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those on the left were not cautious because they wanted to exploit the shootings for political gain. Fox News, perceived as the &#8220;conservative&#8221; channel, was the perfect vehicle for the smear.</p>
<p>This will go down as a case study of how the left used a conservative news source to smear conservatives. They all ended up with egg on their faces because they ran with erroneous information that wasn&rsquo;t checked out and which only contributed to the confusion and chaos and smeared an innocent group in the process. Ironically, the false report about a &#8220;hate&#8221; group generated more hate.</p>
<p>Fox News has still not officially retracted and apologized for the false charges. As a responsible news organization, it has an obligation to explain what will be done internally to make sure this never happens again in the midst of a national crisis when the media should be in the business of providing accurate and truthful information.<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.examiner.com/charleston-conservative-in-charleston-sc/fox-news-was-worst-offender-post-az-shooting-accusations">Smears Against Jared Taylor and American Renaissance Were False</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Kyle Rogers, Examiner (Charleston), January 11, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immediately after the AZ shooting we saw pundits on MSNBC, CNN, and the national news networks immediately spew vitriol at Sarah Palin, the TEA Party, and Republicans. Before they even new who the shooter was, they had declared what his motives were.</p>
<p>The left-wing website Daily Kos had printed an anti-Giffords diatribe two days before the shooting titled &#8220;My Congresswoman is DEAD to me.&#8221; None of the media outlets blamed Daily Kos for statement made two days prior to the shooting. However Sarah Palin was attacked for something she posted online a year before the shooting.</p>
<p>The accusations were vile and caustic. When we finally got an accurate profile of the shooter, none of it turned out to be true. The shooter was a leftist in High School, who had morphed into a sort of anarcho-nihilist who thrived on confrontations.</p>
<p>He did not target Giffords because she was a Democrat. He had been harboring a person grudge against her for three years and attending one or more campaign events. She had laughed at a nonsensical question he asked her in 2007.</p>
<p>He did not target Giffords because of her stand on immigration or social issues. None of Laughers online diatribes even mention these causes at all. Giffords is not even very far to the left. She is a moderate &#8220;blue dog&#8221; Democrat who shoots guns and rides a motorcycle.</p>
<p>He did not target Gifford because she is Jewish. Loughner himself has a Jewish mother.</p>
<p>Sadly, however, all of the disgusting accusation and insinuations by CNN, MSNBC, and the national news networks did not compare to the nasty fabricated slurs made by Fox News.</p>
<p>Fox News purported to have an &#8220;internal DHS memo&#8221; stating the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;no direct connection  &mdash;  but strong suspicion is being directed at AmRen / American Renaissance. Suspect is possibly linked to this group. (through videos posted on his myspace and YouTube account.). The group&rsquo;s ideology is anti government, anti immigration, anti ZOG (Zionist Occupational Government), anti Semitic. Gabrielle Gifford is the first Jewish female elected to such a high position in the US government. She was also opposite this group&rsquo;s ideology when it came to immigration debate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The information contained in this memo is beyond absurd. American Renaissance is a monthly magazine edited by Jared Taylor. He is the author of the famous &#8220;Paved with Good Intentions,&#8221; a controversial book on the failure of America&rsquo;s welfare system.</p>
<p>Taylor and American Renaissance magazine has never been anti-government, nor is it anti-Semitic. In fact the magazine runs articles by Jewish authors, some of which have spoken at American Renaissance conferences. {snip}</p>
<p>Over the course of the day, Sunday, spokesman for the ADL and the SPLC both told reporters that they did not believe the shooter was connected to American Renaissance. SPLC spokesman Mark Potok even stated that Jared Taylor &#8220;is not anti-Semitic.&#8221; Now the ADL &amp; the SPLC are far-left groups who raise money by hurling wild accusations at conservative groups. In fact Mark Potok, of the SPLC, was on Keith Olberman Monday night blaming Republicans for motivating the shooter. However, not even these groups could repeat the claims about Jared Taylor and American Renaissance with a straight face!</p>
<p>Fox News ran with this claim, placing it in at least four articles on their website. At least two Fox News personalities made even worse claims on the air. They stated, &#8220;The shooter is linked to American Renaissance.&#8221; Not &#8220;suspicion of a possible link,&#8221; but &#8220;linked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fox News did not call Jared Taylor to ask him for his response as any responsible journalist would. Taylor had to find out about the accusations from a CNN producer who called him! Taylor had to contact Fox News and fight with them to get a statement on their website defending himself. He was never allowed to defend himself against the even worse slurs made over the air.</p>
<p>As the day went on, a bizarre trend emerged. None of the other cable news or national news networks were reporting the claim. The only major news sources, other than Fox News, was the Huffington Post and foreign newspapers owned by Fox News parent company News Corp. The Huffington Post quoted Fox News as their source. Something was indeed suspicious about the alleged &#8220;internal DHS memo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, around midnight Sunday, Fox News began doctoring the claims about the memo on it&rsquo;s website. &#8220;Internal DHS memo&#8221; suddenly became &#8220;a law enforcement memo based on information provided by DHS.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, the memo was written by someone, connected to some law enforcement agency, which allegedly had access to information from the DHS. I talked to Jared Taylor repeated while all this was going on and Fox News would not even give him a real source for the memo. In fact, Fox News even changed the content of the memo to correct a major factual error that had made the memo look suspicious.</p>
<p>In their original version of the memo it reads,&#8221; Gabrielle Gifford is the first Jewish female elected to such a high position in the US government.&#8221; Suddenly Fox News had changed this to &#8220;Congressman[sic] Giffords is the first Jewish female elected to high office in Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take a look at this screen shot [see below]. I took this of the Fox News website at 2:30 AM Monday morning. Fox News flunkies, in their haste, changed the source of the memo to an unspecified &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; agency in the first line but did not change it in the title.</p>
<p>The title of the article still contains the phony baloney claim that it is a &#8220;DHS Memo.&#8221; In the third paragraph you can see the doctored up line from the memo that Fox News changed.</p>
<p>Then, Monday morning, Washington Post writer Greg Sargent called Fox News on their fraud. He interviewed a DHS spokesman. This spokesman said the information did not come from the DHS. The DHS never told anyone that Loughner was possibly linked to any group. In fact the DHS was not giving anyone information about the shooter, because the FBI was in charge of doing this!</p>
<p>Was Fox News remorseful about perpetrating this fraud? Did they make a retraction? Absolutely not! Fox News spent much of the day Monday attacking other news networks for their accusations against Sarah Palin and others, despite making the vilest accusation themselves. In the midst of their self-righteous indignation at other news agencies, Fox News covered up their original fake story with a new fake story.</p>
<p>Fox News correspondent James Rosen was seen live still claiming that the &#8220;possible link&#8221; allegation was copied from a DHS memo unto an unsourced &#8220;law enforcement memo.&#8221; He then says, &#8220;A new DHS memo does not mention the group.&#8221; The entire statement is a fraud, as the DHS had already said they did not make the claim at all! Rosen slurred American Renaissance, not as anti-Semitic, but this time as &#8220;white supremacist.&#8221;</p>
<p>As best I can tell the reason for this vicious smear campaign by Fox News was to deflect attention away from Sarah Palin. True, the attacks on Sarah Palin were wrong. However, Fox News could have taken the high ground. They could have defended Sarah Palin with dignity instead of stooping even lower than the other news agencies.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor has been the victim of left-wing harassment campaigns, threats, and even physical violence. Yet he has always urged civility and maintained the utmost professionalism in everything he does. He certainly did not deserve to be smeared by Fox News.</p>

		<p>A commenter at VFR says the association is because the youtube video of Loughner had side links for AR. This isn&rsquo;t due to any association by Loughner, it&rsquo;s due to the association of the name Jared by youtube. The yahoo Barney Fifes at the ACTIC are apparently too stupid to realize that just because youtube offers related links, doesn&rsquo;t mean those links are actually related. It&rsquo;s a keyword match is all, and both have Jared as a common keyword.</p>

		<p>So much for Fox News Channel as the &#8220;conservative&#8221; TV news outlet of record.  Not even CNN or MSNBC would be so gullible or mendacious as to run this story without checking basic facts.  </p>
<p>On the brighter side of things, think of the blowup as an affirmation of the old show business saying, &#8220;there&rsquo;s no such thing as bad publicity.&#8221;  AR probably tripled its audience overnight.</p>

		<p>From Kyle Rogers, author of Examiner article above.</p>
<p>It looks like Examiner.com has already disabled my account. I&rsquo;ve been de-listed as the &#8220;Charleston Conservative Writer&#8221; and no longer has the ability to post articles, or even moderate the comments on my article.</p>
<p>Examiner.com is chock full of losers writing 2-3 articles a day which never get any Facebook shares or comments. No one is reading 95% of the content on that site. (I would guess that the top 5% of authors generate 80% of the sites traffic). </p>
<p>My article has a bunch of shares and comments. I assume that I was de-listed because some lefties complained about the article. Which is just proof that people were reading it.</p>
<p>If I was one of the hundreds of lefties writing slander on Examiner.com day after day, I&rsquo;d still be writing, because no even reads any of their stuff to complain about it.</p>
<p>The good news is that the article has not been deleted itself. </p>
<p>The funny thing is an Examiner rep personally approved of the article. Your first article has to be approved by an Examiner rep manually. I also had to submit writing before hand. I sent two, one of which was about Kennewick Man and could be considered a &#8220;pro-white&#8221; article.</p>
<p>My Examiner rep e-mailed me back saying he doesn&rsquo;t know what happened. So someone higher up than him didn&rsquo;t like me.</p>
<p>It took a week and a half for the Examiner rep assigned to me to approve me and set up the account. About 18 hours to kick me off. :-)</p>
<p>The good news is that the article comes up prominently on all Google searches including the coveted Google News. It also came up as the LEAD article, complete with picture of Jared Taylor, on Examiner.com for the Lowcountry region of South Carolina for about 16 hours or so. Apparently it picks the lead article based on date and popularity.</p>
<p>Since then an article I wrote about immigration comes up as the second lead story in the Charleston, SC front page. </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/6zcbz6p" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/6zcbz6p</a></p>
<p>By the way. Examiner.com gets more traffic that the websites of ABC, CBS, NBC, and MSNBC. Only FoxNews and CNN get more.</p>
<p>I just submitted the same article to Yahoo.com&rsquo;s Associated Content.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Instead, his behavior was strongly suggestive of paranoid schizophrenia and drug abuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will state for the record, as I have done recently on two other occasions already, that we all know (and knew) that these bizarre charges against AR and Mr. Taylor were totally false. While the views of Mr. Taylor and his publication can be seen as &ldquo;controversial,&rdquo; neither he or his periodical have ever advocated violence, let alone shooting a Congresswoman and others at a shopping mall. Moreover, I must reiterate my unbridled disgust with Fox News, which acted with unprofessional ineptitude at best here and at worst, with the deliberate intent to malign and degrade a honorable man and his organization. </p>
<p>With that said, I would like to address the issue of paranoid schizophrenia and marihuana abuse, as may not have been considered by some here. Paranoid schizophrenia, is a disorder in which the sufferer feels and thinks in delusional terms; such an individual often holds strange beliefs of grandiose and elaborate persecution fantasies, that can range from the people in their daily lives to larger representations of authority or phenomenal curiosity, such as governmental institutions or even space aliens. They may not strike one as particularly odd, unless you have extended conversations with them, or tap into some element of their delusional construct that sets them off. This does differ from general schizophrenia, which is marked by periods of florid psychosis, involving delusions and hallucinations that result in highly disorganized and unusual behaviors if untreated.</p>
<p>Both however, are the products of  (not fully understood) biochemical and neurological imbalances, that can be managed/controlled with psychotropic medications that regulate or correct these imbalances. This is akin to using insulin to control diabetes physically in a sufferer of that disorder, for example.  </p>
<p>Thus we come to the issue of marijuana and the abuse of other drugs for those who suffer with schizophrenia. Just as a diabetic should not be consuming bags of sugar and Snicker bars, so too should marijuana, alcohol, and other drugs of abuse be avoided by the schizophrenic, because they impact biochemistry and neurological functioning. Moreover, prolonged use can exacerbate symptoms over functioning, while also reducing the effectiveness of treatment with antipsychotic medications.</p>
<p>Just something to think about and all the best,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

Every news outlet has a direct link to the SPLC and other liberal groups. These groups worm their way into the hearts, and more importantly, minds of news groups so as to feed them the information and spin they want. Groups like the SPLC basically write press releases that news organizations copy and paste. Look at the end of articles and you will see a footnote mentioning &#8216;the SPLC, ADL, La Raza contributed to this article&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I watched the NBC Nightly News and they gave a completely different bio of Mr. Loughner than was first alleged. Interviews with friends show he had no link to any &#8216;right wing&rsquo; group and that his mental condition had been deteriorating for a year because of drinking, drugs, and numerous personal setbacks.<br>
  <br>
It should be easy to show how the left jumped on this shooting to spread their lies and propaganda.</p>
<p>One more thing. </p>
<p>The left has been screaming about &#8216;paranoid, right-wing, gun owns fearful that the government is going to take away their guns&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Is it paranoia that the left is calling for new gun laws and new restrictions? No. It&rsquo;s the left that is FEEDING this confiscation &#8216;paranoia&rsquo;. If the left stopped calling for restrictions, gun owners wouldn&rsquo;t be &#8216;paranoid&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>American Renaissance should sue FOX news, ACTIC and other groups for defamation. Hit them where it hurts, in the pocket book. The publicity would also help get the message out to the brain-washed masses that Whites are under unrelenting attack by their government and in grave danger of being dispossessed in a nation built by their forefathers.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a double standard. When those on the left commit crime, the media blames society or conservative ignorance and they work to prove the criminals are really &#8216;victims&rsquo;. When whites or those on the right commit crime, this too is blamed on the conservatives. Meanwhile leftists run things, or at least their agenda has become reality over the last 50 years, point by point, and all during that time crime increased exponentially and no one notices, except to blame those on the right. I suppose noticing would be &#8216;hate&rsquo;.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really bizarre.  Fox went to great lengths to correct their error, and the above poster is right, the left had the tactic prepared well in advance and used one conservative org to smear another.  This isn&rsquo;t the first time they&rsquo;ve done something like this.</p>
<p>I can guarantee you that Fox will never fall for the same trick again, and Krugman and the other lefties will feel the repercussions from their deviousness for the next year at least.</p>

As the so-called conservative news outlet now tries to ignore their for-profit-sensationalism on the premise that the populace has no memory they only ignore the fact that THEY LIED, which is something not easily forgotten.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;The group&rsquo;s ideology is <b>anti government</b>&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I keep seeing this disturbing phrase more and more lately.  Since exactly when has being &#8220;anti government&#8221; been synonymous with violent extremism?  Is being opposed to our corrupt and antiWhite regime now to be the new taboo?  I expect this sort of thing from the left, but when supposed &#8220;conservatives&#8221;   &mdash;   including some right here on this forum   &mdash;   start chanting &#8220;anti government&#8221; in the same breath with &#8220;terrorist extremist murdering fanatics,&#8221; then the right is only doing the left&rsquo;s work for it.</p>

<p>Partly.  But it&rsquo;s also true that certain &#8220;conservatives&#8221; look down their long William-Buckley noses at anyone further to the right than themselves, and will not hesitate to point a condemnatory finger in order to deflect attention away from their own lofty brand of &#8220;conservatism.&#8221;  &#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; they&rsquo;ll say, &#8220;<i>we&rsquo;re</i> not Evil Racists   &mdash;   or Anti Semites, or Anti Governmentists or whatever   &mdash;   we&rsquo;re <i>Respectable Conservatives</i>, and we&rsquo;re <i>nice</i> guys.  It&rsquo;s those <i>others</i> who are the dangerous ones.  Go get&rsquo;em, and let the feeding frenzy begin!&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, judging by some of the comments posted around here over the past few days, I&rsquo;d say that it isn&rsquo;t just Faux News that&rsquo;s grown fond of this sleazy tactic.</p>

		<p>MSM calls anyone &#8220;right wing&#8221; who doesn&rsquo;t agree with them.  They&rsquo;ve used that lie with a lot of success over the last 50 years. The truth is, Beck is a libertarian, O&rsquo;Reilly is a big supporter of forced race mixing, and Hannity is a Republican hack.  The only reason they are on FNC is because they are bringing in millions of dollars to the network.  If they weren&rsquo;t making the big bucks, they would be replaced with same faces that are on the other networks.</p>

		<p>People losing their lives is no doubt a tragedy, and I think observance of such a tragedy is in order.</p>
<p>But, I can&rsquo;t help thinking about the over abundant eulogizing, concern and undue concentration on this latest shooting incident.</p>
<p>What makes the attack on a government official or a cop anymore tragic or serious than the murder of ordinary citizens?</p>
<p>Of all the men maimed and killed in these unnecessary wars in Afghanistan and Iraq not one incident of all the numerous deaths have been given the attention, as this one occurence has, obviously because it concerned a public official.</p>
<p>In fact, I might even go so far as to say I think it&rsquo;s appalling to dwell so heavily on this incident and give scant attention to other tragic deaths, then treating the public official at a godlike status who was near perfection.</p>
<p>I have to admit I doin&rsquo;t know the extent of injuries to other victims, except that there were other deaths, but have we been privvy to a news account giving us a moment by moment description of their latest reactions, as they are quick to do with the Congresswoman?</p>
<p>Our priorities are badly skewed.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I see the wisdom in slamming FOX News any more than necessary.  Let&rsquo;s agree that mistakes can and will happen.  It&rsquo;s how these mistakes are handled that matters most now.  I trust the seasoned diplomacy of Jared Taylor.  Given the opportunity, Mr. Taylor is entirely capable of characterizing AR and its readership community in a favourable light.  Handled properly, perhaps FOX News will see fit to do us right and provide Mr. Taylor the chance to speak on our behalf.  After all, to do less would be anything but &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221;.<br>

<p>The word &#8220;priorities&#8221; 1st came to mind when reading the initial indictment against Loughner. All federal employees/officials named, the others wounded or killed don&rsquo;t merit a complaint, it would seem. Rather brazenly at that.</p>

<p>There may be a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; explanation for it, but it certainly leaves a bad impression.</p>

<p>Even if it were a &#8220;mistake&#8221;, I think their&rsquo;s a bit of a difference between an &#8220;honest&#8221; mistake and negligence. It shouldn&rsquo;t need to be explained why this was not an honest mistake, but I&rsquo;ll just point out that Murdoch&rsquo;s Fox News staff could have done 5 minutes of investigation and seen good reason not to run with a leaked memo, containing spurious information(even excluding their AmRen mention!), and apparently mischaracterizing it as coming from Dept of Homeland Security. </p>

		<p>   I think the media should compare the universal condemnation of Jared Loughner for the shooting of Congresswomen Gifford and her guests in America: to the almost universal praise the assassin of Pakistani Politician Salman Taseer has received in Pakistan  &mdash;  even from highly educated professional lawyers! </p>
<p>Taseer was against Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy law, under which a Christian women was recently condemned to death. Most of  Pakistan approves of this law. We attack Pakistanis with drones from Afghanistan and at the same time allow thousands of fanatical Pakistanis to settle in the &#8220;Allied Countries&rdquo; Who but a fanatic would consider this a rational immigration policy?<br>

		<p>Nature is ever parsimonious.You see whenever a large mammal dies, out in the open, from a wound that caused its lifeblood to gush out on the ground, the first thing that happens is that it attracts blowflies.Yes, blowflies by some supernatural ability unexplained by science are able to detect the minutist molecular diffusion of blood odor and as if &#8216;by magic&rsquo; they appear, literally, out of nowhere and proceed to gorge on the fresh, nutritious blood to the extent that the animal is a black heaving mass of flies.<br>
 Now, it&rsquo;s not my intention to disgust or revolt, this is a phenomenom repeated in nature millions of times, but the behavior of certain sections of the US media and their shamless opportunism at the first whiff of anything, anything at all they can capitalize on, suggests an analogy.</p>
