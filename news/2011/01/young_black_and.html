			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeannine Stein, Los Angeles Times, January 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Young black and Hispanic women may be screened at higher rates for the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia than young white women, a study finds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More black and Hispanic young women were tested for chlamydia compared with white young women  &mdash;  the numbers were 65%, 72% and 45%, respectively. Black young women were 2.7 times as likely and Hispanic women were 9.7 times as likely to be screened for the diseased as their white counterparts</p>
<p>Insurance also played a role in who got screened. Young women with public and public pending insurance had a better chance of getting screened for chlamydia than those who were privately insured. When researchers looked at screenings based on public or private insurance status only, they found that young black and Hispanic women still had a greater chance of being screened than young white women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for why this may be occurring, lead study author Dr. Sarah Wiehe said in a news release that perceptions based on race or ethnicity may play a role: &#8220;For some common conditions like breast cancer, white women are more likely to receive a screening test like mammography,&#8221; she said. &#8220;For chlamydia infections  &mdash;  which are highly stigmatized STDs  &mdash;  white women are less likely, while minority women are more likely, to receive screening. This may mean that providers make judgments about a woman&rsquo;s likelihood of infection based on her race or ethnicity. Yet in an asymptomatic condition like chlamydia, all sexually active young women should be screened.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study was published online in the journal Pediatrics.</p>

		<p>Being screened for possible STD is unpleasant, and in some cases humiliating, but it needs to be done on ALL young women  &mdash;  no exceptions, so that it becomes a routine part of the exams. The practice of testing less young white women increases the chances that the infection will not be detected or treated, thus increasing the rate of complications for the untreated women and her future (possibly white) babies.</p>

		<p>I knew a nurse who worked in our local juvenile hall.  This was 30 years ago, before the hispanic invasion.  Although the county had only 8 percent black population virtually 90 percent of both adult and juvenile criminals were black.</p>
<p>My friend said the black girls were virtually all infected.  She said she felt like she was working in an STD clinic.</p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t win here.  If they were being tested at a lower rate than for whites, there would be no end to the wailing.</p>
<p>Another thing  &mdash;  there are actually people who keep track of this sort of thing?  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Yet in an asymptomatic condition like chlamydia, all sexually active young women should be screened.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is an absolute lie as anyone who has ever had chlamydia can attest to.  Chlamydia has obvious irritating symptoms that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Private insurance companies restrict tests.  Some people have died because their insurance companies don&rsquo;t allow the tests.</p>
<p>Then there is the factor that some people do not get chlamydia because they have never had contact with an infected person.  Someone who restricts her sexual contacts to men she is serious about or married to obviously has fewer chances of contacting chlamydia than someone who has many contacts with men who have many contacts.</p>
<p>The only way to be sexually active and not catch something is to get married and both parties stay faithful.</p>
<p>Whites tend to marry and remain faithful than blacks and hispanics.  Unmarried Whites have fewer random sexual contacts than blacks and hispanics.</p>
<p>No Dr. has ever suggested to me that I get some test for anything unless I mention some sign or symptom to the Dr.</p>
<p>If they get tested it is discrimination.  If they don&rsquo;t get tested it is discrimination.  Give this Dr. an A+ for victimology.<br>

		<p>I suppose the next step will be that they&rsquo;ll ask all young women of all races between certain ages to get tested for chlamydia, just to increase the self esteem of the blacks and Hispanics, and the promulgate the egalitarian fiction that &#8220;everyone is at risk&#8221; so that us schmucks don&rsquo;t run off and get the crazy idea there might be racial differences in biology that beget racial differences in behavior and in turn racial differences in STD infection rates.  Of course, private insurance and Medicaid are just going to love paying for tests that are unnecessary because most young women don&rsquo;t show any symptoms of chlamydia.</p>

		<p>How dare these politically incorrect racists test black women for chlamydia at 9 times the rate of white women!!!</p>
<p>What, do they think blacks have 9 times the infection rate as Caucasians? <br>

		<p>Be careful what you ask for Dr. Sarah Wiehe, in your quest to be politically correct and test Black &amp; Whites equally you might actually further confirm the governments own statistics that African Americans have an 8.8 more likely to have chlamydia.  https://www.cdc.gov/std/health-disparities/race.htm  As it stands right now that statistic clearly confirms that Whites &amp; Blacks behave differently, more testing would likely seal the stat in concrete. </p>
<p>A rational medical practitioner knowing that statistic then asking some basic questions about there patients sexual activity such as if they have had unprotected sex and if so how many partners etc. can certainly determine if the test is medically necessary.   Additionally, other studies confirm that black women are less likely to use protection and have more sexual partners then white women. </p>

		<p><i>This may mean that providers make judgments about a woman&rsquo;s likelihood of infection based on her race or ethnicity.</i></p>
<p>Make a judgement based on race?  Somebody call the Office of Equity! The DOJ!  File Hate Charges against anyone making such a racist assumption!  He should be subjected to persecution and prison time for suggested something as outrageous as assuming race/ethnicity may be tied to rates of STI infection! </p>
<p><i>In 2007, approximately 48% of all chlamydia U.S. cases occurred among blacks. In that same year, the prevalence rate of chlamydia among blacks was almost nine times higher than that of whites&hellip; From 2003 to 2007, the chlamydia prevalence rate increased by 25% among blacks.</i></p>

<p><i>From 2003 to 2007, the chlamydia prevalence rate increased by 10.5% among Hispanics/Latinos.The prevalence rate among Hispanics/Latinos was also three times higher than that of whites in 2007.</i></p>

<p>This is clearly racial profiling and <b>must be stopped immediately.</b></p>
<p>In the name of Social Justice, black/hispanic STI screening rates must MATCH those of Whites and must be decreased dramatically, effective immediately, with  a mandated five-year Consent Degree put in place, overseen by an iron-fisted commission with added enforcement from the DOJ.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t chlamydia a STD more prevalent among minorities anyway, than among Caucasians, ? Therefore, why shouldn&rsquo;t Bantus and mestizos be screened more for the disease?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s akin to saying Jews are screened for Tay-Sachs disease, at a higher rate than Mexicans are.</p>

		<p>My wife use to work at a large commercial medical lab doing tests for STD&rsquo;s. Based on zip code, Blacks were far more likely to test positive for all STD&rsquo;s. The youngest was 12 years old. That happened more than once.   </p>

		<p>According to the Center for Disease Control, there is a disparity of chlamydia infection. Teen women are nfected more than other ages, black women more than hispanic, hispanic more than white.</p>

		<p>Gee, it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be that white women are less likely to engage in behaviors that put them at risk for such diseases, could it? No, that would be &#8220;racist&#8221; to the black and Hispanic women. </p>

<p>All STDs have signs and symptoms.  There is no reason to test unless the woman mentions signs and symptoms which are obvious, irriating and can&rsquo;t be ignored.</p>
<p>By the way, there are some young unmarried women who are entirely celibate for years at a time.</p>
<p>Why test them?</p>

		<p>Yes but you see, despite the fact that young women in the age range 12-18 are more likely to be &#8216;socially useless&rsquo; under the new universal medical aid denial guidelines we call &#8216;Obamacare&rsquo;, the fact remains that keeping them free of STDs insures that when they do become &#8216;socially worthwhile&rsquo; (19-32) they will be both better workers and better prospective marrital partners if they aren&rsquo;t running around in constant pain from reproductive organs that look like swiss cheese.</p>
<p>And we all know that blacks (85%) and hispanics (50%, in LA) are more likely to be &#8216;early achievers&rsquo; in this area anyway so we can also buy into the &#8216;defender of a protected class!&rsquo; status points game.</p>
<p>Quick, someone call big Medico, this is a chance to $ell a $creening kit that could save &#8216;billion$&rsquo;!</p>
