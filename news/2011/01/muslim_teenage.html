			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katherine Danks, The Daily Telegraph (Sydney), January 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A MUSLIM girl caught between her religion, her parents and wanting to be a typical Aussie teenager is at the centre of an apprehended violence order against her father after he found she had a boyfriend. </p>
<p>Police were called to the family home after the man threatened to kill himself and the 14-year-old girl when he discovered the boy in a room of their home, Parramatta Bail Court heard yesterday.</p>
<p>The man, who cannot be named, allegedly told police the relationship was disrespectful to Muslim culture and brought shame on his family in the Afghan community.</p>
<p>The court heard he tried to detain the boy in the early hours of New Year&rsquo;s Day at the house in Blacktown.</p>
<p>The family called police because they were scared the father would kill the boy.</p>
<p>After police arrived, the man became enraged because they would not arrest the boy, who had been invited into the house by his daughter.</p>
<p>He said the boyfriend would be killed if the incident happened in Afghanistan, the country he and his wife had emigrated from in 1998.</p>
<p>&#8220;The accused then stated, as the boyfriend would not be going to jail, the only thing left to do was kill his daughter and himself,&#8221; police said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The complainant is stuck between her religion, strict parents and wanting to be a typical Australian teenager.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officers claimed that on October 27 the daughter ran away from home. Her father said he would kill himself if she did not return by sundown.</p>
<p>When she did not return, the father attempted to hang himself but was stopped by his wife and son.</p>
<p>&#8220;The daughter said she fears that her father will kill her because of her actions and that if he doesn&rsquo;t, she will be locked in the house unable to leave, unless he kills himself,&#8221; police said.</p>
<p>Police took out an apprehended domestic violence order against the father on behalf of the girl. He was charged with stalking, intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm.</p>
<p>The father, who is a qualified surgeon in Afghanistan but employed as a taxi driver in Sydney, was refused bail because of his threats against the girl and self-harm history.</p>
<p>The matter will be mentioned in Blacktown Local Court on January 12.<br>

		<p>Years ago I trained for a short time with some Muslim soldiers, we were all friends in those days. </p>
<p>These guys were very clear about the way they treat women back in the home country. Even if a woman is alone with a man in a room this is enough to get her throat cut. One of the guys told me that if a wife were to fool around on her husband then it&rsquo;s up to her father or her brothers to kill her so as not to bring shame on the family. </p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>But this fool was not in Afghanistan. He was in Australia!<br>
He&rsquo;s been there twelve years now, and hadn&rsquo;t realized that yet?</p>
<p>This is such an insane religion! Utterly irrational!</p>
<p>Why are we so foolish to import this nonsense into our countries?   &mdash;   bringing in problems where we had none!</p>
<p>As I understand, Moslems must kill the daughter because she has brought shame upon the family in the eyes of their neighbors.   But when you&rsquo;re living in Australia and your neighbors are Australians, where is the shame?</p>
<p>In the eyes of Australians, killing your daughter is shameful.</p>
<p>Importing these people is all done for the sake  of demonstrating how good and  open-minded we are. But the irony is that we are bending over backwards towards people who are NOT open-minded! We are being open-minded toward closed-minded religious fanatics who  have contempt for us and would kill us if they could.</p>
<p>Bottom line:  Who is the craziest   &mdash;   they or we? </p>

		<p>Naked people and clothed people do not do well in the same neighborhood. Islam is not compatible with many Western values.</p>
<p>People need to open the eyes and realize that diversity is a pipe dream. It is not going to work in Australia or anywhere else. If they get enough of a foothold and we continue to acquiesce to their demands our culture will be lost forever.</p>

		<p>Poor boy.  He must be really hard up if he wants to play slap and tickle with an Afghan girl.</p>
<p>Of course the obvious thing to do here is charge the father with every possible court fee and then ship every single one of them back home, making him pay for the airline tickets from his taxicab earnings.</p>
<p>Australia, you stupid bunch of fools.  Stop this while you still have a culture where &#8216;typical Aussie teenager&rsquo; actually means something.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my idea: we beat the father within an inch of his life and dump him in the middle of afghanistan. Minus his wife and daughter. </p>
<p>That way, he can enjoy all the wonderful laws and tolerance that afghanistan offers.</p>
<p>Afghan/Pakistani/Indian/African males have an attitude towards both women and western law/culture that is disgusting. There is no reason to keep them here.<br>

		<p>As long as Muslims continue to infiltrate civilized nations, we will be subjected to this type of behavior and beliefs. This is certainly a reason to highlight the ills of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; They have no intention of following the laws of this nation or any other. Their mindset is that of people living in the 7th century and is totally incompatible with modern day laws and rules. They need to return to their countries of origin and sink back into the era of the dark ages.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;ve been told by more than one highly educated, professional Muslim father that he won&rsquo;t allow his daughter to &#8220;date&#8221; boys in the Western fashion. This is deeply ingrained in Islamic culture, and I don&rsquo;t see any change in the future. Muslims won&rsquo;t change and we have to accept it. The murder of the offending girl or boyfriend is rare, but not unknown. We can&rsquo;t force Muslim women to become free Western Feminists. This is the bitter fruit of open borders, and unrestricted immigration.  </p>

		<p>Sardonicus: <i>We can&rsquo;t force Muslim women to become free Western Feminists.</i></p>
<p>Why the hell would we want to do that? How has feminism worked out for the West?</p>
<p>Without condoning &#8220;honor killing&#8221;, let me point out a few facts. The girl is 14 years old. The boy was found &#8220;in a room&#8221; (any guesses which one?) in the man&rsquo;s home in the early hours of the morning. The girl has a history of running away from home. Clearly she is out of control. And yes, she is a disgrace to her father.</p>
<p>I have a lot of sympathy for this man. Yes, he should have stayed in his own country. And we should never have allowed feminism to turn our daughters into sluts. I have been lucky enough to raise three beautiful and virtuous daughters, but I truly fear for my grandchildren in today&rsquo;s corrosive culture.</p>

<p>   This is exactly the problem in Afghanistan. We are asking Muslims to change their Islamic tribal culture and substitute Free Western Feminism. The Taliban are resisting in a fanatical fashion and we are being beaten by men wearing pajamas, wearing flip-flops and hauling rusty AK 47s. At the same time, we are importing thousands of immigrants from this war-torn region  &mdash;  this is recipe for catastrophe. </p>

		<p>I recently had  a long face to face conversation with a young man from Australia. He is FURIOUS about what&rsquo;s happening in his country. People coming to Australia from Asia are NOT learning English, and are basically trying to transplant their old way of life on new territory. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Analog man&#8221; is right. Incidentally, the protection of women is not only a Moslem characteristic. Until less than a century ago, females in southern and eastern Europe were protected in much the same way. The alternative is unwanted pregancy, use of contraceptives by age 13, or repeated abortions. </p>

		<p>I too agree with # 11 Analog Man. When I see young women out late at night, affected by alcohol &amp; drugs, being available to all comers all in the name of partying and having a good time. I too dispair for the way our society is heading.</p>
<p>Yes, most Muslim and Asian families literally lock up their daughters, many are not even permitted to travel on buses or trains to or from school, Father drops them off and picks them up. Muslim clerics have also taken a stand against some of the over the top feminist inspired personal development (sex education) curiculum in our schools.(Posibly one of the few positives I can come up with)</p>
<p>Some Muslim teenager girls certainly do try and rebel against their strict upbringing thus the clash of cultures which is the subject of this posting.<br>
 <br>
But Muslim boys seem to have a free reign, they will be typically found racing their high powered cars around suburban streets at all hours of the night. It seems to be part of their culture to take the many stupid white teenager girls who make themselves quite available. (often through the party scene) Muslim youths have been involved in some of the most horrific sexual assult cases this country has ever known.</p>
<p>When Muslims come to this country  for a better life they should know they are coming to country which is known (among other things)for its beach culture, it&rsquo;s layback lifestyle and a social scene which involves the consumption of alcohol. They should also know they are coming to a country which does not allow forced marriages, child brides or polygamy.</p>
<p>I suggest that these uninvited newcomers to Australia start to accept the country which is now giving them everything otherwise they should simply go back to medievil war-torn hell holes that they have recently escaped from.</p>
<p>My wife was recently talking to a taxi driver, his family had escaped from Iran. They thought they had left Islam behind them, but no, the Clerics came and visited them and now his daughters have all gone back to wearing burqas!</p>
<p>Perhaps some Muslims will intergrate into mainstream Australian (or US or Canadian) society but somehow it does not seem too likely.</p>
<p>I feel Islamic immigration is a Trojan horse which is set to destroy our western civilization, I want to see it stoped and NOW and we must never bow down to them.</p>
