<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p> <span class="dropcap">F</span>orty years after his death, the 
popularity of Martin Luther King remains extraordinary. He is perhaps 
the single most praised person in American history, and millions adore 
him as a hero and almost a saint. The federal government has made space 
available on the Mall in Washington for a national monument for King, 
not far from Lincoln&rsquo;s. Only four men in American history have national 
monuments: Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt; and now 
King will make five. </p>

        <p> King is the only American who enjoys the nation&rsquo;s highest 
honor of having a national holiday on his birthday. There are other days
 of remembrance such as Presidents&rsquo; Day, but no one else but Jesus 
Christ is recognized with a similar holiday. Does King deserve such 
honors? Much that has been known to scholars for years   &mdash;   but largely 
unknown to most Americans   &mdash;   suggests otherwise. </p>
        <p> <strong>Plagiarism</strong> </p>
        <p> As a young man, King started plagiarizing the work of others and he continued this practice throughout his career. </p>
        <p> At Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, 
where he received a bachelor of divinity degree in 1951, many of his 
papers contained material lifted verbatim and without acknowledgement 
from published sources. An extensive project started at Stanford 
University in 1984 to publish all of King&rsquo;s papers tracked down the 
original sources for these early papers and concluded that his academic 
writings are &#8220;tragically flawed by numerous instances of plagiarism.&#8221; 
Journalist Theodore Pappas, who has also reviewed the collection, found 
one paper showing &#8220;verbatim theft&#8221; in 20 of a total of 24 paragraphs. He
 writes: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> &#8220;King&rsquo;s plagiarisms are easy to detect because their style
 rises above the level of his pedestrian student prose. In general, if 
the sentences are eloquent, witty, insightful, or pithy, or contain 
allusions, analogies, metaphors, or similes, it is safe to assume that 
the section has been purloined.&#8221; </p>
        </blockquote>

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> King also plagiarized himself, recycling old term papers as 
new ones. Some of his professors complained about sloppy references, but
 they seem to have had no idea how extensively he was stealing material,
 and his habits were well established by the time he entered the PhD 
program at Boston University. King plagiarized one-third of his 343-page
 dissertation, the book-length project required to earn a PhD, leading 
some to say he should be stripped of his doctoral degree. Mr. Pappas 
explains that King&rsquo;s plagiarism was a lifelong habit: </p>
        <p> &#8220;King&rsquo;s Nobel Prize Lecture was plagiarized extensively from
 works by Florida minister J. Wallace Hamilton; the sections on Gandhi 
and nonviolence in his &#8216;Pilgrimage&rsquo; speech were taken virtually verbatim
 from Harris Wofford&rsquo;s speech on the same topic; the frequently replayed
 climax to the &#8216;I Have a Dream&rsquo; speech   &mdash;   the &#8216;from every mountainside, 
let freedom ring&rsquo; portion   &mdash;   came from a 1952 address to the Republican 
National Convention by a black preacher named Archibald Carey; and the 
1968 sermon in which King prophesied his martyrdom was based on works by
 J. Wallace Hamilton and Methodist minister Harold Bosley.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Perhaps King had no choice but to use the words of others. 
Mr. Pappas has found that on the Graduate Record Exam, King &#8220;scored in 
the second-lowest quartile in English and vocabulary, in the lowest ten 
percent in quantitative analysis, and in the lowest third on his 
advanced test in philosophy.&#8221; </p>
        <p> <strong>Adultery </strong> </p>
        <p> King lived a double life. During the day, he would speak to 
large crowds, quoting Scripture and invoking God&rsquo;s will, and at night he
 frequently had sex with women from the audience. &#8220;King&rsquo;s habits of 
sexual adventure had been well established by the time he was married,&#8221; 
says Michael Eric Dyson of Georgetown University, a King admirer. He 
notes that King often &#8220;told lewd jokes,&#8221; &#8220;shared women with friends,&#8221; 
and was &#8220;sexually reckless.&#8221; According to King biographer Taylor Branch,
 during a long party on the night of January 6 and 7, 1964, an FBI 
bugging device recorded King&rsquo;s &#8220;distinctive voice ring out above others 
with pulsating abandon, saying, &#8216;I&rsquo;m f***ing for God!&rsquo;&#8221; </p>
        <p> Sex with single and married women continued after King 
married, and on the night before his death, King had two adulterous 
trysts. His first rendezvous was at a woman&rsquo;s house, the second in a 
hotel room. The source for this was his best friend and 
second-in-command, Ralph Abernathy, who noted that the second woman was 
&#8220;a member of the Kentucky legislature,&#8221; now known to be Georgia Davis 
Powers. </p>
        <table class="boxleft">

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> Abernathy went on to say that a third woman was also looking
 for King that same night, but found his bed empty. She knew his habits 
and was angry when they met later that morning. In response, writes 
Abernathy, King &#8220;lost his temper&#8221; and &#8220;knocked her across the bed  &hellip;
 She leapt up to fight back, and for a moment they were engaged in a 
full-blown fight, with [King] clearly winning.&#8221; A few hours later, King 
ate lunch with Abernathy and discussed the importance of nonviolence for
 their movement. </p>
        <p> To other colleagues, King justified his adultery this way: 
&#8220;I&rsquo;m away from home twenty-five to twenty-seven days a month. F***ing&rsquo;s a
 form of anxiety reduction.&#8221; King had many one-night stands but also 
grew close to one of his girlfriends in a relationship that became, 
according to Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer David Garrow, &#8220;the 
emotional centerpiece of King&rsquo;s life.&#8221; Still, sex with other women 
remained &#8220;a commonplace of King&rsquo;s travels.&#8221; </p>
        <p> In private, King could be extremely crude. On one FBI 
recording, King said to Abernathy in what was no doubt a teasing remark,
 &#8220;Come on over here, you big black motherf***er, and let me suck your 
d**k.&#8221; FBI sources told Taylor Branch about a surveillance tape of King 
watching a televised rerun of the Kennedy funeral. When he saw the 
famous moment when Jacqueline Kennedy knelt with her children before her
 dead husband&rsquo;s coffin, King reportedly sneered, &#8220;Look at her. Sucking 
him off one last time.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Despite his obsession with sex and his betrayal of his own 
wife and children, and despite Christianity&rsquo;s call for fidelity, King 
continued to claim the moral authority of a Baptist minister. </p>
        <p> <strong>Whites </strong> </p>
        <p> King stated that the &#8220;vast majority of white Americans are 
racist&#8221; and that they refused to share power. His solution was to 
redistribute wealth and power through reparations for slavery and racial
 quotas: </p>
        <p> &#8220;No amount of gold could provide an adequate compensation 
for the exploitation and humiliation of the Negro in America down 
through the centuries. Not all the wealth of this affluent society could
 meet the bill. Yet a price can be placed on unpaid wages  &hellip;
 The payment should be in the form of a massive program by the 
government of special, compensatory measures which could be regarded as a
 settlement.&#8221; Continued King, &#8220;Moral justification for such measures for
 Negroes is rooted in the robberies inherent in the institution of 
slavery.&#8221; He named his plan the Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged. 
Some poor whites would also receive compensation because they were 
&#8220;derivative victims of slavery,&#8221; but the welfare of blacks was his 
central focus. </p>

        <p> King has been praised, even by conservatives, as the great 
advocate of color-blindness. They focus too narrowly on one sentence in 
his &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech, in which he said he wanted to live in a 
nation &#8220;where [my children] will not be judged by the color of their 
skin but by the content of their character.&#8221; The truth is that King 
wanted quotas for blacks. &#8220;[I]f a city has a 30 percent Negro 
population,&#8221; King reasoned, &#8220;then it is logical to assume that Negroes 
should have at least 30 percent of the jobs in any particular company, 
and jobs in all categories rather than only in menial areas.&#8221; </p>
        <p> One of King&rsquo;s greatest achievements is said to have been 
passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. At the signing ceremony on July
 2, he stood directly behind President Lyndon Johnson as a key guest. 
The federal agency created by the act, the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, now monitors hiring practices and ensures that King&rsquo;s 
desires for racial preferences are met. </p>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> Like liberals today, King denied racial differences. In a 
reply to an interviewer who told him many Southern whites thought racial
 differences were a biological fact, he replied: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> &#8220;This utterly ignorant fallacy has been so thoroughly 
refuted by the social scientists, as well as by medical science, that 
any individual who goes on believing it is standing in an absolutely 
misguided and diminishing circle. The American Anthropological 
Association has unanimously adopted a resolution repudiating statements 
that Negroes are biologically, in innate mental ability or in any other 
way inferior to whites.&#8221; </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> The conclusions to be drawn from his belief in 
across-the-board equality were clear: failure by blacks to achieve at 
the level of whites could be explained only by white oppression. As King
 explained in one interview, &#8220;I think we have to honestly admit that the
 problems in the world today, as they relate to the question of race, 
must be blamed on the whole doctrine of white supremacy, the whole 
doctrine of racism, and these doctrines came into being through the 
white race and the exploitation of the colored peoples of the world.&#8221; 
King predicted that &#8220;if the white world&#8221; does not stop this racism and 
oppression, &#8220;then we can end up in the world with a kind of race war.&#8221; </p>
        <p> <strong>Communism</strong> </p>
        <p> In his public speeches, King never called himself a 
communist, instead claiming to stand for a synthesis of capitalism and 
communism: &#8220;[C]apitalism fails to realize that life is social. Communism
 fails to realize that life is individual. Truth is found neither in the
 rugged individualism of capitalism nor in the impersonal collectivism 
of communism. The Kingdom of God is found in a synthesis that combines 
the truths of these two opposites.&#8221; </p>

        <p> However, David Garrow found that in private King &#8220;made it 
clear to close friends that economically speaking he considered himself 
what he termed a Marxist.&#8221; Mr. Garrow passes along an account of a 
conversation C.L.R. James, a Marxist intellectual, had with King: &#8220;King 
leaned over to me saying, &#8216;I don&rsquo;t say such things from the pulpit, 
James, but that is what I really believe.&rsquo; &hellip;
 King wanted me to know that he understood and accepted, and in fact 
agreed with, the ideas that I was putting forward   &mdash;   ideas which were 
fundamentally Marxist-Leninist  &hellip; I saw him
 as a man whose ideas were as advanced as any of us on the Left, but 
who, as he actually said to me, could not say such things from the 
pulpit  &hellip; King was a man with clear ideas, 
but whose position as a churchman, etc. imposed on him the necessity of 
reserve.&#8221; J. Pius Barbour, a close friend of King&rsquo;s at seminary, agreed 
that he &#8220;was economically a Marxist.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Some of King&rsquo;s most influential advisors were Communists 
with direct ties to the Soviet Union. One was Stanley Levison, whom Mr. 
Garrow called King&rsquo;s &#8220;most important political counselor&#8221; and &#8220;at Martin
 Luther King&rsquo;s elbow.&#8221; He organized fundraisers for King, counseled him 
on tax issues and political strategy, wrote fundraising letters and his 
United Packinghouse Workers Convention speech, edited parts of his 
books, advised him on his first major national address, and prepped King
 for questions from the media. Coretta Scott King said of Levison that 
he was &#8220;[a]lways working in the background, his contribution has been 
indispensable,&#8221; and Mr. Garrow says the association with Levison was 
&#8220;without a doubt King&rsquo;s closest friendship with a white person.&#8221; </p>
        <p> What were Levison&rsquo;s political views? John Barron is the 
author of Operation SOLO, which is about &#8220;the most vital intelligence 
operation the FBI ever had sustained against the Soviet Union.&#8221; Part of 
its work was to track Levison who, according to Mr. Barron, &#8220;gained 
admission into the inner circle of the communist underground&#8221; in the US.
 Mr. Garrow, a strong defender of King, admits that Levison was &#8220;one of 
the two top financiers&#8221; of the Communist Party of the United States 
(CPUSA), which received about one million dollars a year from the Soviet
 Union. Mr. Garrow found that Levison was &#8220;directly involved in the 
Communist Party&rsquo;s most sensitive financial dealings,&#8221; and acknowledged 
there was first-hand evidence of Levison&rsquo;s &#8220;financial link to the Soviet
 Union.&#8221; </p>
        <table class="boxleft">

        </tbody></table>
        <p> Hunter Pitts O&rsquo;Dell, who was elected in 1959 to the national
 committee, the governing body for the CPUSA, was another party member 
who worked for King. According to FBI reports, Levison installed O&rsquo;Dell 
as the head of King&rsquo;s New York office, and later recommended that O&rsquo;Dell
 be made King&rsquo;s executive assistant in Atlanta. </p>
        <p> King knew his associates were Communists. President Kennedy 
himself gave an &#8220;explicit personal order&#8221; to King advising against his 
&#8220;shocking association with Stanley Levison.&#8221; Once when he was walking 
privately with King in the White House Rose Garden, Kennedy also named 
O&rsquo;Dell and said to King: &#8220;They&rsquo;re Communists. You&rsquo;ve got to get rid of 
them.&#8221; </p>
        <p> The Communist connections help explain why Attorney General 
Robert F. Kennedy authorized the FBI to wiretap King&rsquo;s home and office 
telephones in October 1963. Kennedy, like his brother John, was deeply 
sympathetic to King but also aware of the threat of communism. </p>
        <p> Mr. Garrow tried to exonerate King of the charge of being a 
fellow traveler by arguing that Levison broke with the CPUSA while he 
worked for King, that is, from the time he met King in the summer of 
1956 until King&rsquo;s death in 1968. However, as historian Samuel Francis 
has pointed out, an official break with the CPUSA does not necessarily 
mean a break with the goals of communism or with the Soviet Union. </p>
        <p> John Barron argues that if Levison had defected from the 
CPUSA and renounced communism, he would not have associated with former 
comrades, such as CP officials Lem Harris, Hunter Pitts O&rsquo;Dell, and Roy 
Bennett (Levison&rsquo;s twin brother who had changed his last name). He was 
also close to the highly placed KGB officer Victor Lessiovsky, who was 
an assistant to the head of the United Nations, U Thant. </p>

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> Mr. Barron asks why Lessiovsky would &#8220;fritter away his time and risk his career  &hellip; by repeatedly indulging himself in idle lunches or amusing cocktail conversation with an undistinguished lawyer [Levison]  &hellip;
 who had nothing to offer the KGB, or with someone who had deserted the 
party and its discipline, or with someone about whom the KGB knew 
nothing?  &hellip; And why would an ordinary American lawyer  &hellip; meet, again and again, with a Soviet assistant to the boss of the United Nations?&#8221; </p>
        <p> Other Communists who worked with King included Aubrey 
Williams, James Dombrowski, Carl Braden, William Melish, Ella J. Baker, 
Bayard Rustin, and Benjamin Smith. King also &#8220;associated and cooperated 
with a number of groups known to be CPUSA front organizations or to be 
heavily penetrated and influenced by members of the Communist Party&#8221;   &mdash;   
for example, the Southern Conference Educational Fund; Committee to 
Secure Justice for Morton Sobell; the United Electrical, Radio and 
Machine Workers of America; the National Lawyers Guild; and the 
Highlander Folk School. </p>
        <p> The CPUSA clearly tried to influence King and his movement. 
An FBI report of May 6, 1960 from Jack Childs, one of the FBI&rsquo;s most 
accomplished spies and a winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom for
 Intelligence, said that the CP &#8220;feels that it is definitely to the 
Party&rsquo;s advantage to assign outstanding Party members to work with the 
[Martin] Luther King group. CP policy at the moment is to concentrate 
upon Martin Luther King.&#8221; </p>

        <p> As Republican Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina 
concluded in a Senate speech written by Francis, King&rsquo;s alliance with 
Communists was evidence of &#8220;identified Communists  &hellip;
 planning the influencing and manipulation of King for their own 
purposes.&#8221; At the same time, King relied on them for speech writing, 
fundraising, and raising public awareness. They, in turn, used his 
stature and fame to their own benefit. Senator Helms cited Congressman 
John M. Ashbrook, a ranking member of the House Committee on Un-American
 Activities, who said: &#8220;King has consistently worked with Communists and
 has helped give them a respectability they do not deserve. I believe he
 has done more for the Communist Party than any other person of this 
decade.&#8221; </p>
        <p> <strong>Christianity </strong> </p>
        <p> King strongly doubted several core beliefs of Christianity. 
&#8220;I was ordained to the Christian ministry,&#8221; he claimed, but Stanford 
University&rsquo;s online repository includes King&rsquo;s seminary writings in 
which he disputed the full divinity of Jesus, the Virgin Birth, and the 
Resurrection, suggesting that we &#8220;strip them of their literal 
interpretation.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Regarding the divine nature of Jesus, King wrote that Jesus 
was godlike, but not God. People called Jesus divine because they &#8220;found
 God in him&#8221; like a divinely inspired teacher, not because he literally 
was God, as Jesus himself claimed. On the Virgin Birth, King wrote: </p>

          <p> &#8220;First we must admit that the evidence for the tenability of this doctrine is to [<em>sic</em>]
 shallow to convince any objective thinker. How then did this doctrine 
arise? A clue to this inquiry may be found in a sentence from St. 
Justin&rsquo;s First Apology. Here Justin states that the birth of Jesus is 
quite similar to the birth of the sons of Zeus. It was believed in Greek
 thought that an extraordinary person could only be explained by saying 
that he had a father who was more than human. It is probable that this

        <p> Concerning the Resurrection, King wrote: &#8220;In fact the 
external evidence for the authenticity of this doctrine is found 
wanting.&#8221; The early church, he says, formulated this doctrine because it
 &#8220;had been captivated by the magnetic power of his [Jesus&rsquo;] personality.
 This basic experience led to the faith that he could never die. And so 
in the pre-scientific thought pattern of the first century, this inner 
faith took outward form.&#8221; Thus, in this view, Jesus&rsquo; body never rose 
from the dead, even though according to Scripture, &#8220;And if Christ has 
not been raised, your faith is futile.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Two other essays show how King watered down Christianity. In
 one, he wrote that contemporary mystery religions influenced New 
Testament writers: &#8220;[A]fter being in contact with these surrounding 
religions and hearing certain doctrines expressed, it was only natural 
for some of these views to become part of their subconscious minds  &hellip;
 That Christianity did copy and borrow from Mithraism cannot be denied, 
but it was generally a natural and unconscious process rather than a 
deliberate plan of action.&#8221; In another essay, King wrote that liberal 
theology &#8220;was an attempt to bring religion up intellectually,&#8221; and the 
introduction to the paper at the Stanford website says that King was 
&#8220;scornful of fundamentalism.&#8221; King wrote that in fundamentalism the 
Trinity, the Atonement, and the Second Coming are &#8220;quite prominent,&#8221; but
 again, these are defining beliefs of Christianity. </p>
        <p> <strong>Known and unknown</strong> </p>
        <p> King is both known and unknown. Millions worldwide see him 
as a moral messiah, and American schools teach young children to praise 
him. In the United States there are no fewer than 777 streets named for 
him. But King is also unknown because only a few people are aware of the
 unsavory aspects of his life. The image most people have of King is 
therefore cropped and incomplete. </p>
        <p> In the minds of many, King towers above other Americans as a
 distinguished orator and writer, but this short, 5&rsquo;6½&#8221; man often stole 
the words of others. People believe he was a Christian, but he doubted 
some of the fundamentals of the faith. Our country honors King, but he 
worked closely with Communists who aimed to destroy it. He denied racial
 differences, but fought for racial favoritism in the form of quotas. He
 claimed to be for freedom, but he wanted to force people to associate 
with each other and he promoted the redistribution of wealth in the form
 of reparations for slavery. He quoted the ringing words of the Bible 
and claimed, as a preacher, to be striving to be more like Jesus, but 
his colleagues knew better. </p>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> Perhaps he, too, knew better. His closest political advisor,
 Stanley Levison, said King was &#8220;an intensely guilt-ridden man&#8221; and his 
wife Coretta also called him &#8220;a guilt-ridden man.&#8221; Levison said that the
 praise heaped upon King was &#8220;a continual series of blows to his 
conscience&#8221; because he was such a humble man. If King was guilt-ridden 
might it have been because he knew better than anyone the wide gap 
between his popular image and his true character? </p>
        <p> The FBI surveillance files could throw considerable light on
 his true character, but they will not be made public until 2027. On 
January 31, 1977, as a result of lawsuits by King&rsquo;s allies against the 
FBI, a US district judge ordered the files sealed for 50 years. There 
are reportedly 56 feet of records   &mdash;   tapes, transcripts, and logs   &mdash;   in 
the custody of the National Archives and Record Service. </p>
         Meanwhile, for those who seek to know the real identity of 
this nearly untouchable icon, there is still plenty of evidence with 
which to answer the question: Was Martin Luther King, Jr. America&rsquo;s best
 and greatest man?  <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" height="11" width="11" /><br><br><em>Benjamin J. Ryan is working toward a PhD in Church-State Studies.

		<p>&#8220;King is the only American who enjoys the nation&rsquo;s highest honor of having a national holiday on his birthday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true, but there&rsquo;s a good reason behind it.  Like other mollification of blacks, this was enacted to appease blacks somewhat, along with many other things, to keep them from rioting.</p>
<p>The elites want their power and money intact and not have to worry about losing it in a racial upheaval, so they&rsquo;ll agree to anything to hold on to their power and assets.</p>

		<p><i>Was Martin Luther King, Jr. America&rsquo;s best and greatest man?</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider him to be. On the other hand, he made significant contributions to the group that he belonged to, Southern blacks. His efforts did much to advance their political power, which was low in 1950. I think it proper that they and those who sympathize with them honour King&rsquo;s achievements. King&rsquo;s academic or marital shortcomings, or his Communist connections are matters for their concern, not mine.</p>
<p>The issue that concerns me is that Martin Luther King replaced the two great American heroes, Washington and Lincoln. When Congress was debating the King holiday, I (and I think many Americans) thought that we would be getting another paid holiday, and who can complain about that. This was not the case, Martin Luther King was superseding Washington and Lincoln. King, the symbol of the new liberal America was replacing Washington and Lincoln, the symbols of traditional America. When Reagan signed the King holiday bill, he surrendered America to the liberals.</p>

		<p>Good article, but the fact that MLK doubted Christianity is hardly the strongest argument against him. In fact for the typical liberal, this is a badge of honor! The article should have ended with the strongest arguments against MLK, not the weakest. </p>
<p>In any event, the fact that this &#8220;man of peace&#8221; beat prostitutes is something that not even the liberals can make light of. Their only recourse is to censor this fact.</p>

		<p>Being older, I hope to be alive when the locked away transcripts and other incriminating material is finally released. That should be very interesting when the stuff makes its way into the public domain. Of course we can all expect hysteria and accusations of racism hurled against anyone who publicizes the truth about this man. Let&rsquo;s hope some of those juicy FBI recordings make it onto YouTube. I would hope for some politician to bring up a bill then to repeal the MLK holiday, but it would probaby lead to mass rioting by violent blacks. Liberals will be mum on the subject at best, because they are so twisted in their thought processes, they cannot acknowledge the truth and the fact they were wrong about something even when it is staring them in the face.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The American Anthropological Association has unanimously adopted a resolution repudiating statements that Negroes are biologically, in innate mental ability or in any other way inferior to whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>It almost seems the whole purpose of the &#8216;anthropology&rsquo; field is to show that people of color are noble, pristine, beings free from sin, and that whites (and their ignorant societies) are greedy, unconscionable beings and are always morally inferior to people of color. Maybe this is stereo-typing, or even &#8216;hatred&rsquo;, but I have to believe these most learned scientist have it mixed up as to just which people, and which societies, are ignorant and backwards. They have it so backwards that by listening to them, whites and their white societies are indeed becoming backwards and depraved. What do you know, what the &#8216;anthropologists&rsquo; have said has become true. Bet they&rsquo;re going to blame it on ignorant conservatives if it has to be acknowledged. Generally, as crime and mental illness and depravity goes up they tell us things are better than ever, and it was in the old times things were bad. A few of us are old enough and wise enough to know better.</p>

		<p>the frequently replayed climax to the &lsquo;I Have a Dream&rsquo; speech  &mdash;  the &lsquo;from every mountainside, let freedom ring&rsquo; portion  &mdash;  came from a 1952 address to the Republican National Convention by a black preacher named Archibald Carey<br>

In his Dream speech Martin Luther King also made allusions to Amos 5:24 and Isiah 40:4-5. There was an allusion to the opening line of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Richard III, and to Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s Gettysburg Address. Are we to accuse King of plagiarizing these sources?  <br>
 <br>
It is not unusual for a writer to be inspired by the writings of others. &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; was not written by a ghost writer. Many consider it to be one of the greatest speeches in the English language. Because King was capable of that and other compositions like his &#8220;Letter from a Birmingham Jail,&#8221; his academic plagiarism is as difficult to understand as it is impossible to justify.   </p>

Womanizing is a temptation any man with wealth, power, and/or fame faces. Jimmy Carter resisted it. Martin Luther King did not. Before condemning King more vigorously I would like to know how I would. I was disillusioned when I learned of King&rsquo;s susceptibility to this human frailty. Clergymen should lead better lives. </p>

The American Communist Party has never been much more than a Marxist discussion group. There was never a remote chance that it would establish a Communist dictatorship in the United States.</p>
<p>Unlike those who hate and fear this organization I have known several members as friends. They were infinitely charming, but rather silly, and incapable of starting a meeting on time, much less overthrowing the government of the United States.  </p>

<p>If he DID write it, where in God&rsquo;s name is the greatness?  A man who can write one great speech can write others time and again.  Where are they at?</p>

<p>Are they the same types who declared that Obama is one of the most prolific writers of his time, and we find out Bill Ayers most certainly wrote his book, and that he refuses to release any of his writings, very likely because they aren&rsquo;t very good or, in the case of his tenure at the Harvard Legal Review, he didn&rsquo;t write anything?  Harvard radicals were probably so ecstatic to have a black that could put two sentences together they really didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that Barack Obama was able to win election as editor of the Harvard Law Review because of the *conservative* law students.  He evidently said a thing or three about being &#8220;fair&#8221; to the &#8220;conservative&#8221; (not like you or me, if you want to accept the label at all) portion of the existing law students, and they benefited by voting for &#8220;the first black&#8221; to be the editor, and therefore proving their good neo-con anti-racist bona fides.</p>
<p>And truthfully, I don&rsquo;t think Obama wrote much or anything for the HLR while he was editor.  He was basically an overglorified proofreader/article selector.  </p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I too  have known several such people. A discussion group indeed is their cup of tea!  They were given to infinite wranglings over philosophical principles, abstruse Marxist theory, and arcane - almost theological - hair splitting. </p>
<p>That sort of abstract argument appeals to certain ethnic types, who relish it, but not to blacks. </p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t have the patience and concentration for the study of Marx and Kant,  for history and economics.  Blacks just want to see the results, and quickly,  not to be bothered with the nitpicky philosophical details. In otherwords: &#8220;Where&rsquo;s the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, I can believe that MLK was probably not an official Communist Party member. (The bosses wouldn&rsquo;t even want that, lest it be discovered and he would be &#8220;tarnished&#8221; in the public&rsquo;s eyes.) But I don&rsquo;t have any doubt that they used him as their front man, and that he was surrounded and manipulated by those who were. <br>

MARTIN LUTHER King&rsquo;s &#8220;I have a dream&#8221; speech to 210,000 people gathered at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington, in August 1963 has come out on top of the 100 best political speeches of the 20th century because of his mastery of the spoken word and the impact it had on the American consciousness.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Texas A&M; University have compiled a list of the 100 best American speeches and 10 of the best of British orations over the past 100 years. The list reflects the opinions of 137 scholars of public speaking, who were asked to recommend speeches on the basis of their social and political impact and rhetorical artistry.<br>

There are many more than two political choices in what you call &#8220;the culture war.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
I read any political thinker for insight, rather than doctrine. Karl Marx had several valid insights into laissez faire capitalism, which was the only kind he knew. His critical mistake was to assume that among blue collar workers loyalties of class are usually stronger than loyalties of race, nation, and ethnicity. Because of this error, his writings cannot be seen as a guide to political action. <br>
 <br>
Some on the right call anyone on the left a &#8220;Marxist,&#8221; and think they have achieved something. Instead, they have revealed their intellectual limitations. A mark of intelligence is the ability to make distinctions. </p>

Talented blacks have benefited from the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. More power to them.<br>

It cannot be said that liberal whites have benefited. The persistence of the black characteristics that were cited by segregationists to oppose the legislation destroyed the New Deal Coalition, and lead to the Republican domination of the United States. </p>

		<p> Martin Luther King remains the &#8220;great unknown&#8221;   &mdash;   or rather, the &#8220;great mostly covered up&#8221;   &mdash;   in American politics. Unlike Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, et al, he remains unexamined, by design of those who want him to be an untouchable icon who cannot be criticized by anyone, especially anyone White, on pain of being labeled &#8220;racist,&#8221; hounded out of a position, boycotted, you name it.</p>
<p> In other words, they have made King the &#8220;Mohammed&#8221; of the American Left   &mdash;   especially of the black portion of it. Criticize Mohammed, and you&rsquo;ll be &#8220;condemned&#8221; to die. Criticize King, and they&rsquo;ll make you WISH you were dead!</p>
