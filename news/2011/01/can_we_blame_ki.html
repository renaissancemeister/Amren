<h1><a href="https://www.blackamericaweb.com/?q=articles/news/baw_commentary_news/25053/1">Can We Blame Kids for Bad Schools?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gregory Kane, BlackAmericaWeb, January 14, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Can we at least put the question of whether bad students make for bad schools on the table? Most can&rsquo;t, but Robert Weissberg and Mark Bauerlein have.</p>
<p>Weissberg is the author of a book published in 2010 with the controversial title, &#8220;Bad Students, Not Bad Schools.&#8221; His thesis is that the millions of dollars taxpayers are pumping into public schools won&rsquo;t make a bit of difference if there are students who don&rsquo;t give a fig about learning. {snip}<br>
Bauerlein is the author of &#8220;The Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future.&#8221; Bauerlein did a review of Weissberg&rsquo;s book for the November issue of Commentary magazine and had this to say about America&rsquo;s bad students:</p>
<p>&#8220;Millions of lazy, incurious, disruptive, unintelligent and nearly illiterate youngsters flood classrooms every day, and none of the popular and hugely expensive initiatives and ideas peddled by &#8216;education mayors,&rsquo; well-meaning foundations and professors of education will change them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black folks, being the feisty and contrarian people we are, will simply dismiss Weissberg and Bauerlein as two racist white boys with a conservative agenda. But their point has already been proved. And it came not from some erudite authors like Weissberg or Bauerlein, but from a street-smart but academically clueless kid named Audie.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t remember Audie, then you didn&rsquo;t see the 2008 documentary &#8220;Hard Times at Douglass High,&#8221; about the Baltimore school named for the great Frederick Douglass. {snip}</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Audie&rsquo;s assessment of the importance of school and academics: &#8220;This is what we do,&#8221; he said in the documentary. He was talking about himself and a bunch of other students, who roamed the halls all day and learned nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just walking the halls all day, baby. (Bleep) class. That (bleep&rsquo;s) for clowns, man. Don&rsquo;t nobody go to class around here, man. Man, (bleep) academics. Academics? We gon&rsquo; leave that to them nerd-(bleep)(bleeps). We gon&rsquo; keep it straight &#8216;hood. All my (bleeps) out here, we gon&rsquo; keep it gutter.&#8221;</p>
<p>A black Baltimore businesswoman told me of her latest run-in with black America&rsquo;s Audies. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys were like zombies,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;They hardly did or said anything. One put his head on the desk and went to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls, she said, showed more life, but had a problem with that &#8220;respect for elders&#8221; thing. When she asked members of the class what year Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, she got only blank stares.</p>
<p>&#8220;1964?&#8221; one brave soul volunteered. Close, kid, but no cigar.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So the question of whether bad students make for bad schools should definitely be on the table. {snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been seven years since Bill Cosby made his famous  &mdash;  or, for some black folks, infamous  &mdash;  remarks about those poor blacks who &#8220;weren&rsquo;t holding up their end of the bargain&#8221; when it came to education. A lot of black folks  &mdash;  few of them poor  &mdash;  got mad at Cosby about that. Some of them, like writer and professor Michael Eric Dyson, are still mad at Bill.</p>
<p>But the Cos did something interesting after he made his remarks. He went to several cities and held town hall meetings with some of those same poor blacks he had supposedly dissed. Most welcomed him with open arms because they realized one thing. They didn&rsquo;t just know some of those blacks he was talking about, but they knew some of them by their first names.<br>

<p>  &mdash;  - I work in an urban area.  100% non-white students in all three schools I&rsquo;ve worked in.  Please read the above statement from the article and memorize it.  This is what we live everyday in the fantasy land that is modern &#8216;edumacashun.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>All the differentiation, multiple intelligences, social justice gobbeldygook and project based learning is having NO EFFECT at all.  It really isn&rsquo;t, but the photo-ops of Arne Duncan, Joel Klein et al with beaming young black or latino &#8216;scholars&rsquo; look so irrestable!</p>
<p>Young, liberal do-gooders from Teach for America realize this every day (after only a few short months) and they quit the profession in disillusionment after their two years are up.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve counseled many or listened to their sob stories, but the result is the same: they stop blaming whitey and understand that this country is headed for the trash bin.  </p>
<p>The public is blaming the teachers because of all the illiterates, but that&rsquo;s because there is no one left to blame but themselves or the teachers, so the public takes the easy road and blames white, raciss&rsquo; teachers who just &#8216;don&rsquo;t understand how we&rsquo;s learns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;Eliminate the teachers unions!  Let&rsquo;s have teachers be at-will employees with no rights who can be fired at any time!&rsquo;  This is what you hear all the time now.  You also are told that tenure is a job for life, regardless of skill, which is not true.  Tenure only means you can&rsquo;t be fired for nothing, but they have to prove you are bad.  </p>
<p>If you ever had a bad boss who wanted to fire you just because then you will know why job protections matter, and many admins these days are affirmative action hires who are incompetent.</p>
<p>So good luck finding those &#8216;Supermen&rsquo; teachers you are looking for because who would go into a career and spend all the time and money on a degree when you don&rsquo;t know if you will be fired tomorrow because &#8216;the data&rsquo; says you&rsquo;re a bad teacher, even though you have a class full of parolees, illegal immigrants who are six grade levels behind and a bunch of baby mommas who are absent every other day.</p>
<p>Any time you hear about scores rising somewhere IT IS ALL BECAUSE THE TEACHERS ARE GIVING SYMPATHY/SAVE MY JOB PASSES and for official state scores, IT IS BECAUSE THE TEACHERS ARE GRADING EASY, THE STATE CALCULATES GRADES ON A STEEP CURVE AND THE ADMINS ARE MANIPULATING THE DATA OR OUTRIGHT CHANGING SCORES.</p>
<p>Please read the above paragraph and spray paint it on every billboard in Amerika.  This is the god honest truth and I see it every day.  Little Shaquanda, Diego, DeQuan and Mercedeez would rather play around than learn any whitey knowledge.</p>

		<p>I am dumbfounded. The obvious truth finally comes out and is published - by a black publication, no less! If a black news source can pin the problem on black kids (without even a shred of blame YT in the article, no less), why can&rsquo;t our mainstream news do the same?</p>

<p><br>
So,you blacks are a &#8220;feisty and contrarian people,&#8221; are you? Sounds rather euphemistic and prettied-up to me. I tend to read &#8220;feisty&#8221; as &#8220;loud and belligerent&#8221;; and &#8220;contrarian&#8221; as &#8220;stuck in the kneejerk habit of blaming Whitey for every damn thing under the sun.&#8221; </p>
<p>That said, finding a 21st C. black writer who advocates Bill Cosby approach over the Nat Turner approach, is something of a rarity, so I don&rsquo;t want to be hard on this Gregory Kane. I&rsquo;ll also give him credit for having a normal-sounding name refreshingly free of faux-French, nonsense-Arabic, or apostrophes. <br>

		<p>Could it be, could it really be, that maybe, just maybe, common sense is making a comeback? As much as the do-gooders and the brainwashed masses have been lead and would like to believe that failing schools, random shootings and all the other problems we are encountering is the fault of right or left wing rhetoric, it is the individuals fault. And twisted, lack of or absent parenting skills plays a roll, along with substance abuse and mental impairment.</p>
<p>If I may digress, after a little digging, I found some interesting information on a recent past article published 01-06-11 on AmRen. It is about Robert Butler Jr., the 17 year old who shot and killed his assistant principal Vicki Kaspar and wounded his principal Curtis Case at Millard South High School in Omaha before turning the gun on himself. It seems he had just been suspended from school for driving his vehicle onto the school&rsquo;s sports field. But all that was released by big media concerning any kind of motive for this shooting was a statement Butler made on Facebook, that &#8220;Omaha changed me and (expletive) me up. And the school I attend is even worse&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, if I and my meager skills could find this out, why couldn&rsquo;t the New York Daily News? And why would they not publish it? Because then the responsibility for this shooting would be put where it belongs - on Robert Butler Jr. alone. He received a suspension for breaking the rules and this was his reaction to it. But lying by omission is OK with main stream media. You can&rsquo;t brainwash the sheeple by telling them the truth!  </p>

<p>At the end of the day race is what matters, the problem of blacks in america all stem from race, genetics, IQ differences, physical differences/tribalism.</p>
<p>There is no possible way to solve these issues, you can for the most part reduce problems through segregation, but ideally we will always want blacks out of the country. Especially if leftist traitors continue to persist in government.</p>

		<p>I swear I must be the only guy who remembers even back in 2nd grade when I heard this unforgettable line that gave me the impression blacks were &#8220;a bit different&#8221;.</p>
<p>As our 2nd grade teacher was asking us at the last hour of our day she simply went by each student asking &#8220;What will you be when you grow up?&#8221;. The only two blacks in the class were asked last for some reason, the first one said &#8220;watch Bulls games&#8221;, then the second one which will live throughout my life as a classic for my year and age in school&hellip;&#8221;A robber&#8221;. </p>
<p>Looking back at that, you&rsquo;d think a second grader should not even know what a robber is, but he flat out said it and the teacher (with a somewhat disgusted look) asked soon after &#8220;where would you hide?&#8221; <br>
And the answer was, to which he replied &#8220;IN a tree&#8221;. <br>
You could probably guess who was the only one besides me who didn&rsquo;t laugh at that one..</p>
<p>If I can hear this in second grade, I&rsquo;d hate to know the kids that would say something like that or worse before then!</p>

		<p>the pretence - the BIG LIE - that all human races have the same intelligence and psychology is the root of many, many evils. </p>
<p>most people would prefer to continue to PRETEND (NO ONE actually believes the BIG LIE) it is true than to save civilization. </p>

		<p>Poster # 9 is dead-on correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like having a new car that you want to be able to go from zero to sixty in 12 seconds. Seems simple enough. But it doesn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>So you pour tons of money and time into adding enhancements to the engine and add to the horsepower and modify the exhaust. You put in new seats so people will want to drive it. You give the car a fancy name. You enhance the airbags. But it still won&rsquo;t go from zero to sixty. But other cars do.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, it has four flat tires. And one other thing. On this car - it will ALWAYS have four flat tires. That&rsquo;s just the way it is. That&rsquo;s how it was designed. </p>
<p>So no matter how many times you put on a new tire it is flat. You also notice that many are shredded or torn in certain areas so soon you&rsquo;re just happy if they are whole. Once in a while you think you detect a little air but it never really holds any promise.</p>
<p>In the meantime, everyone tells you something is wrong with the engine. A few people point out that the tires look different than other cars - but they are dismissed as fools because the tires look basically the same with only minor superficial differences so that&rsquo;s not the problem.</p>
<p>It must be the mechanics fault. We need to train better mechanics.  </p>
<p>So basically, this is the 2011 Blackmobile. </p>
<p>This little analogy is why blacks fail in school.<br>
 <br>
=============================================<br>
As # 9 said:</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day race is what matters, the problem of blacks in America all stem from race, genetics, IQ differences, physical differences/tribalism.&#8221;<br>
=============================================</p>
<p>Once white society accepts this by saying, hey, I&rsquo;m sorry the car won&rsquo;t work, but it doesn&rsquo;t, things can change.</p>
<p>First, you get the car off the road. It just can&rsquo;t be on the same road as all the other cars - it slows down ALL the traffic and causes accidents, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>But, the car does move forward, so it can be driven on other roads. Back roads. You can have it do simple things - like move material slowly from here to there. I&rsquo;m sure people in other countries would like to have the car.</p>
<p>In fact, the car might even be better off somewhere else. </p>

		<p>The inner city schools have become nothing more than a very expensive (for tax payers) place for inner city youth to play. Anyone who knows a teacher, who has worked in these schools has heard these same tales. It is the same terrible situation in every urban setting. As noted above, many young teachers quit after a very short time, completely disillusioned. Many that stay end up taking anti-depressants, and counting the days until the end of each school year (and dreading the start of each new school year). I&rsquo;m glad that blacks may be finally starting to recognize this, but the damage has already been done. How do you educate children, from a culture, who place no value on education? You have to change the culture and I don&rsquo;t think that will ever happen. </p>

		<p>As concerns problems of black students and liberal blame, Jay in #3 said it all.  Most people probably realize these truths, but it&rsquo;s political suicide to lay out the facts.  The most that is ever dared is to blame students&rsquo; lack of motivation.  The day is far off when the main reason, IQ, will actually be named.  But, as more and more blacks fail to succeed and the dropout rate reaches into the 90&rsquo;s, blacks themselves will have to move to make changes.  The federal government cannot continue to waste billions on a fool&rsquo;s errand, so the only thing left to do is to &#8220;allow&#8221; blacks to form their own all-black schools for the black underclass.  They&rsquo;ll never blame their own teachers for failure, and matters will, for the most part, settle into the same pattern that existed before desegregation.  <br>

		<p>YES!  In my medium size city, all the high schools improved according to the TAKS tests, except for 2.  Those 2 high schools are primarily mexican students.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 57 and remember when mexicans flooded into America due to the 1965 Immigration Reform Act.  They were not able to make passing grades in school and had to drop out early. Usually around age 12-14.  Even truant officers did not pursue them and force them to attend school because they knew the mexicans could not pass.  And ya don&rsquo;t want a 12 year old sitting forever in the 2nd grade.</p>
<p>In Texas, we now have a 49% drop rate in our major cities.  The vast majority of these drop out students are mexicans.</p>
<p>The Only way to lower the drop rate is to lower the standards for passing up thru the grades and that&rsquo;s exactly what they have been doing for the last 40 years.</p>
<p>Thereby, white students get a low quality education.</p>

		<p>In Washington, DC each school is provided $18,000 per student registered in school each year.

		<p>I started as a freshman at a high school that had been around awhile.  My mother had gone to kindergarten in that same building almost 40 year earlier; that&rsquo;s how long it had been around.  At some point they turned it into a high school, and most of the students had always been white.</p>
<p>Right before I started, they added two brand-new wings to the building.  Blacks immediately protested, saying that it &#8220;wasn&rsquo;t fair&#8221; that whites got such nice new buildings, while their own schools were dumps.  They demanded that the boundaries be changed so that more blacks could attend my school.  </p>
<p>Well, four years later, when I graduated as a senior, those brand, spanking new wings looked like dumps.  Blacks had trashed everything, breaking windows, drawing graffiti, etc.  Most of the good teachers had left in disgust.  Parents who could pull their kids out did so.  Many white students just dropped out.  The courtyard in front of the building was so unsafe, many white girls had fathers or older brothers meet them after school to walk them across the courtyard.  It took the blacks four years to destroy a school that had been around at least 40 years and had never been destroyed by the whites who went there.  </p>
<p>The school still exists, but is probably 98% black now.  It&rsquo;s been renamed to a fancy &#8220;academy&#8221; name.  It also has a day care center for children of the students.  &#8216;Nuff said.</p>

		<p>The truth is, when you have children who come from families and cultures when learning and making something of oneself, &#8220;acting white,&#8221; there&rsquo;s no educating them. If a child does not want to learn, there&rsquo;s no teaching him or her. When academic achievement is regarded as having no value, spending money to educate them is dropping it into an ever expanding black hole for white taxpayers, who are as one other poster correctly noted paying for a playground for up and coming thugs.</p>

		<p>I go one step further. I blame the parents for the bad schools. Parents (or, more accurately, &#8216;mama figures&rsquo;)are the ones creating the bad students. They&rsquo;re the first ones bellowing &#8216;not mah chall&rsquo; when their bad &#8216;chall&rsquo; curses at the teachers and gets in trouble, disrupting the rest of the class. They&rsquo;re the first ones pitching fits with the principals, with the school board when their &#8216;chall&rsquo; is caught truant or fails to gradumacate because they &#8216;don&rsquo;t take tests good&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Even worse, now,  a generation of those &#8216;challs&rsquo; are the ones moving into adult positions in every facet of our society, (including teaching) and are protected from firing by  the EEOC. The ripple has turned into a tsunami.</p>

		<p>We are told that we should raise standards and reduce the dropout rate. Raising standards and reducing the dropout rate is like cutting taxes and balancing the budget. It cannot be done.<br>
 <br>
When standards are raised many students discover that they lack the intelligence or motivation to meet those standards. When these drop out the tax payers no longer waste money in futile efforts to educate them. <br>
 <br>
School administrators of public schools with high third world student bodies should take pride in high dropout rates. It means that they are not compromising standards. </p>

<p>This kid told the media, triple-figure educational consultants, hand-wringing mayors and other government-anointed types, ivory-tower pundits and, most importantly, the taxpaying public the absolute truth about black schools:  that no amount of money, no &#8216;new&rsquo; programs, no 10 million dollar studies, no endless hours of professional development or &#8216;Social Justice&rsquo;/Self-Esteem programs will solve low black achievement.</p>
<p>It is a profound lack of <b>inherent ability, focus and drive found in black average 85 and hispanic average 90 IQs that impedes their education.  </b></p>

<p>Ebonics is so funny in print, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Although I attend a school that is only about 45% white, I must consider myself lucky.  The other four high schools in my district are either majority-black or have blacks as the largest single group, and I was originally zoned for one of those schools.  And, since I&rsquo;m mostly in advanced classes, most of the minorities I know are actually very nice and intelligent people.  I do, however, feel very sorry for my future children.  I was looking at a school-finding website that features racial statistics, and found it nearly impossible to locate a majority-white school.  Of course, I was looking in New York and some of the New Jersey suburbs (such as Bayonnne), but still, even in very white neighborhoods (such as the section of Brooklyn where whites are over 90%), the schools had very few white students.  I even checked private schools, but the situation was hardly better.</p>

		<p>Since blacks always complain about how education fails them (never mind personal responsibility, as a race this charecteristic seems to elude them) let them have their own schools, funded by their own people.  Then maybe, they can stop blaming Whitey, and look at their own limitations for a change.  Of course, the government won&rsquo;t actually allow this to happen for now, but it is a nice fantasy.  As for those people commenting on how blacks are in junior high and high school grades, believe me the same menta<br>
lity extends to college. Just further proof that education as we know it is a waste for most blacks,</p>

		<p>I started 6th grade when desegregation started in Charlotte, NC, so I remember VERY well the difference in the schools before and after. The minorities didn&rsquo;t care one bit about school, and spent most of their time harassing the white kids who had been bused in. My ride was over 45 minutes one way and we had to have the police there while the buses unloaded/loaded, and we were never allowed to go outside, even for PE. It was even worse when my son was in school, and I spent so much time there complaining about the sad excuse for an education he was getting that they knew me by name. One assistant principal actually admitted they had dumbed down the classes so they could keep their end of semester/grade scores up. The problem with the schools is DEFINITELY the students. What ever happened to vo-tech, so the kids not suited to academics could learn a trade and the rest could learn something?</p>

<p>What you write is profoundly untrue.</p>
<p>In California, where I teach, schools funding is determined by something called ADA or Average Daily Attendance.  ADA is used to calculate the amount of money the school receives from state funding.  The school district and state keep a very sharp eye on <b>daily</b> attendance and class size. </p>
<p>A student absent from school or or not in class (as in ditching) = no money for your school.  </p>
<p>School funding is now predicated on a period-by-period, not daily, basis meaning we secondary teachers are mandated to take period-by-period attendance every single period of every single day, a huge task as it takes up classroom time to do this and is made worse by the school district&rsquo;s clunky, slow, error-laden web site that &#8216;goes down&rsquo; every other day.  </p>
<p>Period-to-period attendance also tells the district how many students are in each classroom each day.  About the fifth week of each semester, we teachers are subjected to the dreaded Norm Day, where the district takes a hard look at each class size in each school (up to 40 in some subjects).   Classes that do  not contain the mandated number of students are ordered collapsed or closed, students re-assigned to other teachers, any extra teachers bumped out of the school.  </p>
<p>The upheaval and chaos are unbelievable.</p>
<p>Bumping was until recently, by seniority, down to the hour one signed his contract, but this has been challenged in court by the ACLU, which recently won a settlement nullifying some teacher seniority.</p>
<p>Would I ever like to sit in an empty room and get paid $100,000 for &#8216;doing nothing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I keep writing here:  The public has little to no knowledge of what goes on behind school house doors.  </p>

		<p>A lot of these problems could be solved simply by dropping mandatory attendance laws. Why force them to be in school, terrorizing those who actually want to learn, forcing the whole class to slow down to the pace of the slowest &#8220;students&#8221;?</p>

		<p>&#8220;As noted above, many young teachers quit after a very short time, completely disillusioned&#8221;.</p>
<p>In The Audacity of Hope, Barack Obama writes, &#8220;recent studies show that the single most important factor in determining a student&rsquo;s achievement isn&rsquo;t the color of his skin or where he comes from, but who the child&rsquo;s teacher is&#8221;. </p>
<p>It gets even funnier, &#8220;I constantly meet young people who&rsquo;ve graduated from top colleges and have signed up, through programs like Teach for America, for two-year stints in some of the country&rsquo;s toughest public schools. They find the work extraordinarily rewarding; the kids they teach benefit from their creativity and enthusiasm. But by the end of two years, most have either changed careers or moved to suburban schools - a consequence of low pay, a lack of support from the educational bureaucracy, and a pervasive feeling of isolation&#8221;. </p>
<p>Obama has a solution, &#8220;There&rsquo;s no reason why an experienced, highly qualified, and effective teacher shouldn&rsquo;t earn $100,000 annually at the peak of his or her career. Highly skilled teachers in such critical fields as math and science - as well as those willing to teach in the toughest urban schools - should be paid even more&#8221;.    </p>

Most of these kids live in really poor neighborhoods - projects, that a miniature breeding grounds for ignorance and criminality. Imagine if you grew up in a world, where the only &#8220;mentors&#8221; you had were drug dealers and the like. A world where you are told you are not good enough, you are always the bad guy?

<p>Blacks told they&rsquo;re not good enough and always the bad guy?  Ha HA HA HA</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t watch much TV do you?  Aren&rsquo;t familiar with school textbooks, are you? Don&rsquo;t read mainstream newspapers, do you?  Believe the lies of 0bama and his Minister of Hate, Rev Wright?</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t been paying attention.</p>
<p>Because if you were paying attention to mainstream American culture, you would know that blacks are adulated and worshipped (as saviors, as wise sages, as brilliant doctors, as elite scientists, as erudite scholars)  and it is WHITES who are vilified, abased, mocked and portrayed as <b>always the bad guy</b> (the slave owner with a whip, the rapist/murder/lyncher of innocent blacks)</p>
<p>We have showered blacks with trillions of dollars extracted from the White community and thrown endless opportunities at them, at the expense of our own people.  We Whites are attacked, robbed, murdered and tortured by blacks who hunt us for fun and profit.</p>
<p>Whites are passed over for college admissions, scholarships, promotions, job opportunities and careers in favor of lesser or unqualified blacks.  </p>
<p>This is not in dispute.</p>
<p>If we complain, we Whites are axiomatically called Nazis while blacks have an entire panoply of pro-black advocacy groups ready, willing and able to sue us Whites out of existence and make sure our careers are destroyed if they believe are insulted in any way shape of form.</p>
<p>Who can we Whites call for redress?  Which pro-White advocacy group will enforce my right to &#8216;equality under the law?&rsquo;  Can&rsquo;t think of one, can you?</p>
<p>The government extracts ~ 40% of my salary via satanic taxation to pay for programs to help &#8216;uplift&rsquo; blacks.  Results:  Generation after Generation of blacks married to the government and dependent on government handouts in perpetuity    &mdash;   handouts extracted from White families.</p>
<p>Open Your Eyes.  Whites are being genocided and blacks are useful idiots, nothing more.  When the government elites are done with them, and all signs point in that direction, blacks will &#8216;thrown under the bus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If it will make you feel better about yourself and alleviate any &#8216;guilt&rsquo; you may feel for your &#8216;unearned privileges&rsquo; by helping to &#8216;uplift&rsquo; blacks from a world in which there is no &#8216;escape.&rsquo;  Good Luck!  (because you&rsquo;re going to need it).</p>
