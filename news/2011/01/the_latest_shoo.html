			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean Gabb, seangabb.co.uk, January 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I try to avoid commenting on American affairs. It is usually bad manners to get involved in the politics of a foreign country. It is always unwise for someone to get involved in the politics of country where he does not live. I see this all the time in foreign comments on England  &mdash;  they are never enlightening, but range between repetitions of platitude and the utterly perverse. This being said, the shooting last week by Jared Loughner of Gabrielle Giffords, a politician there, and of several other people, is an exception. The matter of who kills whom in America, and for what reason, is no proper concern of mine. But the shootings have, on both sides of the Atlantic, begun a debate over the possible effects of speech on action. So far as this debate touches on England, and might be used to justify the removal of what freedom we still possess, I do not think it inappropriate to comment on the shootings. </p>
<p>Now, when speaking about the removal of our freedoms, a good place to begin is an article in yesterday&rsquo;s Independent. Mary Ann Sieghart appears to blame the shootings on freedom of speech. She certainly disapproves of those journalists in America who fail to agree with their ruling class on every main issue. She says, for example:</p>
<p>These viewers [of Fox News] were shockingly misinformed. They were twice as likely to believe that most scientists don&rsquo;t believe in climate change and that it wasn&rsquo;t clear whether Obama was born in America. The more often they viewed Fox News, the more likely they were to believe these untruths. And the effect wasn&rsquo;t just a matter of partisan bias. Even Democrats who watched the station were more likely to be misinformed.</p>
<p>This is, I must confess, the first good thing I have heard in recent years of any media outlet owned by Rupert Murdoch. For Mrs Sieghart, though, it stands to reason that anything like the spreading of probable truth on these and other issues must lead inevitably to the shooting of politicians. Such is her opinion, and such seems to be the consensus among other ruling class propagandists here and in America.</p>
<p>I do expect this consensus to fracture in the next few days. In America, media attention may be shifted to the supposed ease with which common people can buy guns. Over here, this would be the waste of a good shooting. Our victim disarmament laws are already about the strictest in the world. The only way left to reduce the number of guns in circulation would be to start disarming criminals and the police. But, though our own censorship laws are also stricter than the American, they are still far from complete. Every so often, there are reports in the newspapers that someone has been arrested for uttering words that might, before about 1980, barely have raised an eyebrow; and libertarians of all shades  &mdash;  real libertarians, that is, not the sort who get jobs with The Guardian or the BBC  &mdash;  then strike up a chorus of horror about the abolition of free speech. </p>
<p>We are, of course, right in one sense. On the other hand, the censorship laws are still applied very feebly, and they do not apply to dissent within the educated classes. So long as we know what phrasing to avoid, we can still complain as we please about the joint loss of our country and of our liberties. Stopping this is much more important to our ruling class than finding an excuse to take away a few more shotguns and hunting rifles. It therefore makes sense for the debate in England over these shootings to remain fixed on the alleged connection between what is called hate speech and violent crime.</p>
<p>Already, the newspapers here are repeating claims about the influence on Jared Loughner of the white nationalist journal American Renaissance. According to a headline in the last Mail on Sunday, &#8220;Tucson shooting suspect [is] linked to fanatical pro-white magazine with anti-Semitic and anti-government views.&#8221; The story is repeated across much of the British media. It is only a matter of time before someone points out that Nick Griffin, leader of the British National Party, was invited to speak last year at an American Renaissance conference  &mdash;  and would have spoken, had this not been cancelled after threats of violence from &#8220;anti-fascist&#8221; protestors. We shall then have a &#8220;clear and obvious&#8221; connection between Mr Griffin and Jared Loughner. </p>
<p>It may be remembered how, in 1999, someone called Michael Copeland let off several bombs in London. He had briefly been a member of the BNP. Though he had left the moment he discovered that no one shared his interest in killing people, calls still went up for the party to be banned. The calls were manifestly unfair. The BNP could be held no more responsible for David Copeland&rsquo;s crimes than the Social Democratic Party could for the crimes of the serial sex killer Dennis Nilsen. But that was then. The BNP is now the third or fourth opposition party in this country. I have no doubt the calls will go up again. I do not think they will fade away so quickly.</p>
<p>But let us look at this &#8220;fanatical&#8221; and &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; and &#8220;anti-government&#8221; and pro-white&#8221; journal. Anyone who looks on the American Renaissance website will see that it is a white nationalist journal. Its overall message is to claim that whites should think of themselves as members of a distinct group, with certain interests and certain aptitudes, and that they should defend their possession of those territories where they now form the majority  &mdash;  and that they should be at least sceptical when members of other groups, or their white allies, call for endless apology and abasement and surrender.</p>
<p>These claims may be true. They may be false. They may equally be irrelevant in a world where a set of cultural values and ways of thinking about the world may have first been developed by whites, but are now the common heritage of all mankind, and where future conflicts will arise not between whites and non-whites, but between believers and disbelievers in the power and autonomy of reason. Civilisation, as it has so far existed, may be overwhelmingly a creation of the white races. But that may not be so in the future. Political correctness and forced multi-culturalism should be denounced as ruling class legitimation strategies. But a libertarian world, based on respect for life, liberty and property, will have its own natural diversity.</p>
<p>But true or false or irrelevant, I can see nothing in American Renaissance that could be remotely described as an incitement to violence. The tone of the journal is uniformly courteous and scholarly. I have never once seen the slightest intemperance of language, except where it has been necessary to quote the words of others. It is not fanatical. It is certainly not anti-Semitic. Some of its writers are Jews. So are many of its readers. If some borderline raving lunatic can read a copy of American Renaissance, and find in it advice that he should go out and shoot someone, that is properly a matter for the lawyers and doctors to consider, not an excuse for censorship of the journal or the persecution of its readers.</p>
<p>The standard response to this sort of factual challenge is to collapse all distinctions between incitement and inspiration, and to carry into the second the moral blame attached to the first. We saw this in 1999, when no one could find evidence that the BNP had recommended any acts of violence. The talk then was all of the &#8220;climate of hate&#8221; variety. The BNP was said to have created an environment within which acts of violence were more likely to be perceived as legitimate. The same argument is used by the anti-pornography lobby. No one can prove that showing pictures of naked women is direct incitement to rape. And so the claim is that these pictures somehow &#8220;dehumanise&#8221; all women and make it more likely that they will be raped.</p>
<p>Whoever uses it, this argument is based on a trick. Incitements to violence imply blame. Inspiration at worst implies causality. Anyone who uses the argument must be a villain or a fool. Most who use it, I am sure, are villains. They are villains because they never apply it consistently. For example, though I have never read the collected writings of Marx and Engels. What I have read, though, does not contain any direct incitement to mass-enslavement and mass-murder. However, they are strong mix of denunciation and utopian fantasy that have obviously inspired the creation of terrorist governments. </p>
<p>Again, the reported words of Christ suggest a more than womanly dislike of violence. But his promise of eternal life for all who will heed his call to repentance has been inspiring various kinds of inquisition for the past two thousand years. Should we therefore use the &#8220;climate of hate argument&#8221; to ban Das Capital or shut down the Roman Catholic Church? I do not think any of the ruling class propagandists who will cry up the alleged link between Jared Loughner and Nick Griffin via Jared Taylor will show much interest in consistency. They want to make the BNP an illegal organisation, and any argument  &mdash;  no matter how defective  &mdash;  will do, so long as they can get enough people to go along with it.</p>
<p>But let us leave the matter of inspiration and go back to arguments about incitement. Let us suppose  &mdash;  and this is not, I believe, the case  &mdash;  that American Renaissance and Nick Griffin and the BNP were to advocate the use of violence. Should this be made grounds for any kind of legal action against them? Again, I will say that this case is hypothetical: it has neither evidence nor other credibility. But let it be supposed for the sake of argument. I think the answer must be no. Someone who commissions violent acts against a named individual is an accessory to the crime, and there is no need to consider the nature or degree of incitement. </p>
<p>It may be a special case when a man is urging on an angry crowd against some nearby object. But someone who makes a speech inside a room, or who writes a book or an article  &mdash;  especially if no names are mentioned or implied, and if no money changes hands  &mdash;  should not be held legally responsible if others take his words, even if in their most natural meaning, and go out and hurt someone. The sole responsibility for acts of violence must lie with those who commit them. This is so because all reasonable considerations make it so. A man who reads or hears an argument for violence will generally have enough time before carrying words into action to think about what he is doing, and to take responsibility. </p>
<p>Deny this, and you have to say that Bill Gates forced me to buy Windows 7 because, three weeks after he offered me a copy for £30, I pulled out a credit card and paid the money  &mdash;  or that Margaret Thatcher forced David Laws to give the taxpayers&rsquo; money to his male lover, because she first allowed House of Commons expenses to become a shadow increase of salary for Members of Parliament.</p>
<p>Moreover, to make a crime of incitement is to deny the possibility of democratic government. If men cannot be trusted to think for themselves, it is both dangerous and a waste of time to trust them with the vote. Of course, this may be a good argument against the sort of democracy we now have. But anyone who really does believe in our current political system should be cautious about accepting any argument that spreads responsibility for criminal acts beyond those who commit them.</p>
<p>I am not saying it is other than disreputable for someone to preach violence against those he dislikes. There is a case for shunning people like Abu Hamza. I just do not see how it can be consistent with any idea of liberal democracy to hold one man guilty of crimes committed by another. But  &mdash;  I repeat  &mdash;  I am not accusing any of the persons mentioned of incitement. I only deny that incitement is the excuse for censorship it is taken to be.</p>
<p>As I have said, what happens in America is not my concern. America is not my country. I have no great regard for the United States as a country or as an idea. Equally, as said, when American facts seem likely to be made into argument for the further theft of English liberties, I do see reason for commenting on those facts. All that remains is to see whether the debate in England goes in the direction that I strongly suspect it will.<br>

		<p>The most recent shooting by Jared Loechner has been used by the controlled media to demonize heterosexual White men.  Anyone who listened to Mark Potok&rsquo;s interview can see that for themselves, and then the unfounded accusation that somehow Amren was involved is just beyond the pale.  </p>
<p>On Aol.com there was a story about recent shootings and killers.  They put the faces up of all White men conveniently neglecting to display the Muslim &#8220;psychiatrist&#8221; who shot 43 people in Texas, and also conveniently neglecting to display the photo of John Allen Muhammed and Lee Malvo, the two &#8220;DC snipers&#8221; - the duo that shot and killed about 13 people one by one at random from the trunk of their car 8 or 9 years ago.  When the Korean named &#8220;Cho&#8221; killed - I think it was 33 people at the University of Virginia, the media publicized it and then dropped the story after a short time.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that White men are singled out by this media for vilification and demonization.  This sort of vilification of White men does not affect me in slightest in terms of conditioning my mind to be a self-hating White man. It only angers me. Unfortunately however, I believe it does condition the minds of most people - men and women.  In the case of most White men it conditions them to be passive and weak and full of guilt.  In the case of White women, it can affect them to the point that they believe that men of other races are more suitable to marry them.  In the case of non-Whites it keeps their anger and historical grudges against the White race going, which in turn makes them more determined to take our country away from us.  When the media demonizes White men, it&rsquo;s like giving a green light to all the non-White races in this country, that so badly want to take what they perceive us to have and to force their cultures on us.  </p>
<p>Wake up White people.<br>

		<p>When it turns out the shooter was a dope smoker who held liberal views will there be apologies and leftist news sites labelled &#8216;controversial&rsquo;? The reality is, tho, violent, angry and desperate people are attracted to organizations like AmRen and the BNP. I think that&rsquo;s the very reason for the BNP itself: to give angry Britain&rsquo;s an outlet or a choice. People are going to become more and more angry. The BNP owes it&rsquo;s existence to the pacification efforts of the ruling class. That&rsquo;s for those who don&rsquo;t leave for Scotland or Wales.   </p>

		<p>This fellow Sean Gabb is laboring so hard to be scrupulously unbiased that he sounds like a man having a rather tepid argument with himself.  He works so hard at dodging even the possibility of Offending anyone by taking a stand on anything that he ends up standing up for very nearly nothing at all.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the norm for White people in Once-great Britain today.<br>

		<p>Crime against whites by persons of color is rampant in the UK while the media makes out as if it is people of color who have reason to be angry. If inciting racial hatred is a crime in the UK, citizens can&rsquo;t educated about ending the incitement of racial hatred against whites also, if no one in concerned about the violence committed against whites in the first place. The overwhelming and disproportionate amount of violence perpetrated against whites in the first place. Sounds like the standard: whites are bad, people of color are good, racket. They accused us of being racist. If it&rsquo;s not even an issue, how can people become concerned about violence against whites. Or is that the whole idea in the first place? In fact, it seems the ones pointing these facts out are the same ones on order to be silenced and condemned. </p>

		<p>Obviously, a fine and gifted fellow, who writes well and has given considerable thought to the very large problem&hellip;is there an offense or a complaint strong enough to enable the few to rob the many of their liberty, or any part of the liberty in a free society?</p>
<p>I was equally annoyed, not actually outraged, by the loose talk attributed to&hellip;.no one in particular, we learn in the end. So much talk on Fox News about the supposed connection between AmRen and the shooter, attributed to the Obama White House, then a DHS memo, then someone else&hellip;.then the whole matter just got dropped into a bucket of ice water and everyone left the room. No one owns it and no one wants to take it home.</p>
<p>Someone wanted a stampede and they failed. Too many wanted it to be so and they were disappointed. Many Americans automatically sensed that the shooter was probably an illegal alien from Mexico&hellip;.not actually far fetched. Indeed, who would have been surprised?? Tens of thousands of murders in Mexico, plenty of violence along the border, and at least half this country expected the shooter to be Hispanic. Thankfully, he was not. He was just a disturbed young man with a mental problem.<br>

So a mentally ill, left-wing Jew shoots a Congresswoman and the mainstream media tries to pin the blame on the Tea Party, on right-wing White Gentiles and on the pro-White movement. This should be a good reminder to everyone to be suspicious of the mainstream media. Jared Loughner and Gabrielle Giffords attend the same Synagogue.</p>

		<p>Almost all of the hoopla over Loughner is left-wing propaganda.  Does a single one of the hand-wringing liberal establishment bemoan the fact that Obama used the language of violence in referring to opponents of his platform?  Had some nut murdered a right-winger and then claimed that the President&rsquo;s words directly inspired him, the left would fight tooth and claw to deny any connection.  They would howl that anyone who made such a charge was a racist who had undoubtedly been swayed by the mythical atmosphere of violence instigated by the Tea Party.  <br>
And, of course, the left has seized still another opportunity to call for gun bans.  All this uproar will likely result in a backlash from the right that will manifest in 2012 voting.  But does the left have even an inkling of this?  </p>

<p> Well, you can clearly see how the controlled media spreads untruthful stories when they want to promote their own political agendas. </p>
<p>Jared Loughner was an attention-seeking, apolitical, deranged freak who shot a nine year little white girl in the head. Just what sort of political &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; statement was he making there  &mdash;  I ask the MSM?<br>
 <br>
Many leftist, Neo-Marxists denies the reality of individual responsibility. For them, we are all puppets totally produced by our environment  &mdash;  the superstructure over the production ratio. Of course, they firmly believe that the privileged elites should be the puppet master&rsquo;s pulling the strings.  Individuality is really secondary in their scheme of things. </p>
<p>But evil exists; it&rsquo;s not just having a poor self-image, or not having toys to play with as a child. We all need to acknowledge it, it is an individual choice that we all must make sometime in our lives. <br>

<p>Often true, and I agree the liberal left in particular often express very opinioned and ill-informed views on what is going on in the U.S. However, America is a country which makes a lot of money exportings it&rsquo;s news, movies, business views, etc around the globe, so for Americans to complain about non-Americans having opinions on US affairs is a bit like Paris Hilton complaining about the press being interested in her private life.</p>

<p>NIce work. You just validated what the critics have been saying about this site vis a vis its attitude toward Jews. One post like this can spell the demise of AMREN. The important aspect of this horrible crime was that this guy was an insane misfit freak. His ethnicity, if he is indeed a Jew is irrelevant. He&rsquo;s a murderer and that&rsquo;s all that matters.</p>

You are right, in the sense that that is how it <i>should </i> be. However, up until now that wasn&rsquo;t ALL that matters.  From the very start, it was extremely relevant to the media whether AmRen was anti-Semitic. The press was obsessed with it. They were ready to crucify Taylor over it. One would think that was what this incident was all about. The whole issue of Amren&rsquo;s &#8220;guilt&#8221; seemed to hang on that point (which of course should have been irrelevant). But when the tables are turned and now it turns out that he (apparently)is Jewish, suddenly we&rsquo;re told it&rsquo;s irrlevant. It&rsquo;s a little late to say that now. Why was the alleged &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221; issue considered so relevant before?</p>
