<p>As seen in [a video] clip  &mdash;  which includes some cursing  &mdash;  the female combatants are seen punching and wrestling with each other as tables are toppled. At one point, a woman picks up a coffee pot and strikes another woman in the head while she is being pinned to a table. Later, a man is seen swinging a cane at the woman who was struck with the coffee pot. The woman, adopting a lion tamer&rsquo;s pose, picks up a chair and tosses it at the cane wielder.</p>
<p>When Orangeburg County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department deputies arrived at the IHOP at 5:10 AM, the fight participants had already departed. And despite the restaurant having been wrecked by the brawlers, security and management &#8220;did not want to pursue any charges on the incident,&#8221; according to a sheriff&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>{snip} Barbara Walters, the interim sheriff .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. told TSG that investigators were conducting interviews and piecing together the names (some of which are street names) of those involved in an attempt to make arrests.</p>

<p>Vicious Attack on Wendy&rsquo;s Worker</p>
<p>Andrea Day, WNYX-TV (New York), January 24, 2011</p>
<p>A fight broke out at a Wendy&rsquo;s in Queens Village, leaving one of the workers seriously injured. The disturbing scene from inside the Wendy&rsquo;s was captured on a phone on Friday. In the video, you can see the cashier get pummeled to the ground by teenage girls.</p>
<p>A Wendy&rsquo;s employee told Fox 5 that it started with one girl attacking the woman and a large group of them jumped in and punched her. The worker said it all began when the group started fighting and throwing food. She was behind the counter when her co-worker walked over to try and stop them, she said.</p>
<p>The woman who was attacked suffered a concussion and is currently unable to work.</p>

		<p>Whenever one brings up the failure of the social and economic schemes actively promoted during the 60s 70s revolution, the elderly activists invariably reference their successful efforts to integrate lunch counters where, prior to that time, friendly shoppers would gather with one another to peacefully discuss matters of mutual interest with one another. It is seldom mentioned that this spelt the beginning of the end of not only the friendly lunch counter, but the end of many other institutions engaged in socially beneficial commerce as well. </p>
<p>Review of photographs taken during that era invariably depict well dressed but hungry &#8220;youthful &#8220;Black&#8221; discrimination &#8220;victims&#8221; peacefully sitting at lunch counters. Events filmed at the time depict respectful &#8220;foul-language and violence free&#8221; &#8220;Blacks&#8221; eagerly anticipating and respectfully awaiting their being served. </p>
<p>Things sure have changed, but I guess that is an indication of &#8220;the social progress&#8221; our nation has made. </p>

 Almost all the patrons were black in that Ihop, so it&rsquo;s not really surprising something like this would eventually go down. Needing a security officer on the premises should be construed as a warning to stay away. IMO, that white couple seen in the video were not using good judgement by being there.<br>
  On the other hand, this happened in South Carolina, a state where the black population is just under 30%. This makes it rather challenging to live a normal life and avoid them at the same time.</p>

		<p>Maybe they were upset because the white hostess did not seat them in a timely manor.Perhaps the white waitress or waiter was not giving them polite and good service because of white racism. Sheriff Barbara Walters should do an exclusive report on the story and get to the bottom of it.</p>

		<p>Re: Wendys.</p>
<p>White Girl, black neighborhood, I wonder if she is the only one who can do the books?</p>
<p>Whatever the gender, it is _insane_ to take on a black person without being ready (as in equipped and with planned intent ahead of time) to finish the fight.  Gender for Gender, there is that big a difference in immediate aggression due to testosterone and adrenaline.  If you don&rsquo;t stand ready to hurt, first, you will be.  They just come on and come on with no sense of anything but hitting.</p>
<p>In this, 4-5 black girls are easily the equivalent of 2 white males and it looked more like 10+ to me with not one of them standing up to stop their friends savagery.</p>
<p>Coffee up your cops and give them a freebie every once in awhile.  Know the names of officers and have their personals on speeddial as well as 9/11.</p>
<p>You need to make sure that the parking lot as well as main store and rear (garbage/delivery) areas are all under HD video to get license plates and faces at high enough resolution to matter.  That&rsquo;s the only way to beat the street-name strategy.</p>
<p>If Wendy&rsquo;s has anything like a moral bone in their corporate body, they will tell this Martin Van Buren High School to spread the word: No one under 18 in our premises, forever.</p>
<p>That, more than any single other action, by the cops or parents, will send a message to the right people.  Probably with a fist.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we all know that profit margin will beat probity.</p>

		<p>I truly feel sorry for the white waitstaff that had to serve all these blacks. They are notoriously disrespectful towards waitstaff and are the worst tippers on earth. I guarantee that over half the tables left no tip at all. My sister watied tables and they referred to blacks as &#8220;canadians&#8221; so they wouldnt get any leftie in earshot upset. Even the black waitresses didnt want the blacks seated in their stations.<br>
 A completely disagreeable race in every respect.</p>

<p>What, pray tell, is a &#8220;street name?&#8221; Can I presume this is the Black version of what the remainder of society call a nickname? Even in this, Blacks must separate themselves from the rest of us. Why not let them go ALL THE WAY and be separated altogether!!</p>

		<p>I am saddened by the relentless descent into animal behavior that I&rsquo;m seeing more and more in our society. There has been a very serious breakdown of civility in our country. How is it that anyone would think this type of behavior is appropriate?</p>
<p>I wish the manager had a gun and simply shot it into the ceiling with a loud &#8220;THAT IS ENOUGH!&#8221; This is the only response I can see getting attention and getting results. Unfortunately, just telling customers to stop with their violence would probably only invite the violence, as seen by the poor cashier at Wendy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Notice the white woman who is just cowering in her booth seat. Not exactly the dining experience I&rsquo;d want. Restaurants better come up with some type of action plan for this because otherwise, they&rsquo;re doomed. No one is going to want to go into a restaurant where they feel their safety is at risk.</p>
<p>Which is why I no longer frequent malls, large festivals, and some restaurants in certain neighborhoods. I&rsquo;d rather cook at home than be subjected to this insanity.</p>
<p>And now that I think of it, have we ever heard Sharpton or Jackson condemn such incidents?</p>

<p>Let me translate that sentence: &#8220;Because blacks ruined our restaurant, if we file charges they may consider it racist&hellip;and immediatly upon action they will be suing us for a racial lawsuit, so we can&rsquo;t do that!&#8221;</p>

		<p>capt. kirkegaard, the image of Canadians should not be tarnished so black people can be talked about undercover.  This trend of using Canadian as a code word for black is irriating to me.  Some other word that is not of European or even Caucasian origin should be used.</p>
<p>These two examples of black mayhem is why many inner city restaurants in black neighborhoods don&rsquo;t have seating.  The owners want the black customers to get their food and leave.  McDonald&rsquo;s has it&rsquo;s seats and tables bolted to the floor.</p>

<p>You could also consider not wanting to press charges as not wanting the blacks who did this to come back and get revenge on the IHOP. Who knows what these blacks are capable of? They (IHOP) might just figure the restaurant got off easy with minimal property damage.</p>

		<p>It usually doesn&rsquo;t take much to get Blacks agitated. Here is a similar incident that occurred in the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I went into a fast food outlet, and saw a Black female co-worker dining with her husband, another black man and three black women. I said hello to her, she responded. There was a joke going around the office, based on the behaviour of a goofy security officer. It involved pointing at someone, and saying, &#8220;Does your assignment require you to be in this location at this time?&#8221;.<br>
 I did this to her. She laughed, but another women became irritated and yelled, &#8220;What&rsquo;s so G_D funny?, you got every F_ing right to be here!&#8221;.<br>
 Her husband told the woman, &#8220;Shut the F up&#8221;.<br>
 The women started yelling and the men became involved. Pushing, hair pulling, and punching began. The party was ejected from the establishment. <br>

		<p>I suppose we have to now do racial profiling when we choose a place to eat, too.</p>
<p>If the racial/ethnic mix isn&rsquo;t predominately white/European, I just don&rsquo;t go there. Better to find a McDonald&rsquo;s drive-thru and eat in the car.<br>

		<p>The IHOP&rsquo;s management made a sensible decision.  Rather than attracting a civil rights lawsuit courtsey of the $PLC jackals and/or violent retaliation and vandalism, they&rsquo;re just going to let their insurance company pick up the tab.  The kind of goons who would tear up a restaurant probably don&rsquo;t have the money to pay for restitution, anyway, and sending this pack of cretins to jail does the owners no financial good.</p>

		<p>For those of you driving along I-26 in South Carolina, Orangeburg is clearly marked on the highway signs. Buy your gas in Charleston or Columbia (depending on where you are traveling) and just avoid Orangeburg all together. Columbia and Charleston have their problems, but there are white areas around Richland, Lexington, Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester Counties. Charleston has the best restaurants in South Carolina. If you are visiting, sample the local cuisine and avoid the chains. A lot of the downtown Charleston restaurants tend to have a very high number of Caucasians as clientele. This is not true for the fast food places in North Charleston. </p>
<p>Wikipedia lists the city of Orangeburg as 67% black and the county as 60%. In reality, it is probably higher than this. Outside of the South, you don&rsquo;t have large numbers of blacks living in rural areas. </p>
