			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail, January 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>You might think that African immigrants are a fairly recent addition to the British scene.</p>
<p>But the discovery of a 1,700-year-old skeleton has turned that idea on its head.</p>
<p>Bones unearthed on the site of a Roman cemetery in Warwickshire are the remains of an African man, archaeologists have concluded.</p>
<p>The discovery, made during analysis of remains found near Stratford-upon-Avon, suggests that African immigrants lived far afield of major settlements, such as London and York, as early as the third or fourth century.</p>
<p>Stuart Palmer, Warwickshire County Council&rsquo;s archaeology projects manager, said the find was surprising because it indicated that people of African descent lived in Warwickshire far earlier than historians thought.</p>
<p>Mr Palmer said: &#8216;African skeletons have previously been found in large Romano-British towns like York, and African units are known to have formed part of the Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall garrison, but we had no reason to expect any in Warwickshire, and certainly not in a community as small as Roman Stratford.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Experts think the skeleton, found in the Tiddington Road area of Stratford during a dig in 2009, may be that of a slave or a former Roman soldier. </p>
<p>A report by experts in excavated remains established that the man was of African descent and was probably in his 40s or 50s when he died.</p>
<p>Mr Palmer said the skeletal remains also revealed that the man was heavily-built and that the condition of his spine showed he was used to carrying heavy loads.</p>
<p>Although the cause of the man&rsquo;s death has not been established, examination of his bones found evidence of arthritis and a childhood plagued by disease or malnutrition.</p>
<p>Mr Palmer added: &#8216;He could, for instance, have been a merchant, although based on the evidence of the skeletal pathology it is probably more likely that he was a slave or an army veteran who retired to Stratford.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>First stories like this have a hidden agenda. They are designed to brainwash the British people into thinking that Africans have a long and rich heritage in Britain when they clearly don&rsquo;t. Secondly the term &#8220;African&#8221; is very misleading. Unlike Europe, Africa was never racially homogeneous. The north African coast was home to Phoenicians, Carthagians, Greeks, etc; people who were not black.</p>

<p>Anyone else see the contradiction here?  The <i>Daily Mail</i> is so thrilled at promoting the idea of ancient &#8220;African immigrants&#8221; that logic goes out the window.  And they know they&rsquo;ll get away with it because it&rsquo;d be Racist to object.<br>

When blacks bring this up, be sure to make them aware that this information only came to light because there are distinct differences in the races which appear in skeletal structure. Race is far more than &#8216;skin deep&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The British media loves to conflate and confuse racial distinctions. They lump the Chinese and Japanese together with Pakistanis and Bangladeshis as &#8220;Asians&#8221; in order to muddy the waters regarding immigrant crime. Now they&rsquo;re trying to confuse the distinction between Caucasian North Africans and black Sub-Saharan Africans in order to make it seem like Somalis and Nigerians have always been part of life in the British Isles. </p>
<p>You can tell how giddy the author was reporting that an &#8220;African&#8221; skeleton had been found in remote England. Now they&rsquo;ll try to use it as another justification for mass-immigration, claiming that Africans have just as much ancestral and historical claim to the British Isles as anyone else. </p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine that an older African black with arthritis would voluntarily want to retire in an area where the climate is brutally cold&hellip;.and very damp.</p>
<p>Odds are he was a slave who couldn&rsquo;t go back to the Mediterranean area, because he was a wanted man. Rome had eyes everywhere, and people sold each other out for a few pieces of silver, as we well know ala Judas Iscariot.<br>

		<p>I wonder if he was black African, or North African.  Considering the territorial extent of the Roman Empire, I would assume he was from North Africa, and at that time North Africans (Carthaginians primarily) had fairly light skin, as the Berbers of North Africa still do today.  The only black area of the Roman Empire was Nubia, a fairly small and not very heavily-populated region south of Egypt.  In fact, I do not believe the Romans ruled Nubia for very long, but retreated back to the southern area of Egypt before the fall of the Empire.</p>

		<p>Poster #1 has a good point but i know that the Romans cremated their dead most of the time.  This find may be legitimate, but it seems odd to me that they would find an &#8220;african&#8221; skeleton from this time period because he must have been brought in by Romans.  That begs the questions: if this is in fact real, why was he not cremated and is this actually a real find.</p>

		<p>I used to think that the images of sub-Saharan Africans in Roman Britain were because erroneous PC revisionism, but it turns out there was a short time when Blacks were in Britain during the 4th century. They were mostly Nubian archers, imported from Egypt. <br>
Around York, skeletal remains were found of sub-Saharans, not simply northern Africans. </p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t stay or settle though. Once the Romans left, so did the Nubians. </p>

		<p>Let the scientists reveal what they have discovered.  There are surprising finds, like the mummies of Celts found in the Gobi Desert in what is now China.  A woman had a witches hat, and they all had red hair.<br>
The worst is the treatment of the seemingly white skeleton in the West Coast state of Washington - a man who lived about 9,000 years ago.  The hatred of science Clinton Administration reburied the bones and destroyed the site.  Still, the oldest skeletal finds in North America may have been that of a white man.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  Hugh Murray </p>

<p>And correct too, when the word African is used, does not always mean a sub-Saharan black Bantu!</p>

		<p>I have never read (and I read A LOT) anywhere in any book of blacks being part of the regular Roman military, the Nubian Africans often used as temporary auxilliaries for particular battles and then thrown away, as in the Punic wars with Carthage. Even these are not described as the dark, blue/black/purple of many blacks.</p>

		<p>The diversity brigade don&rsquo;t understand the difference between 0.0001 percent and 30 percent. Britain, like most trading nations, has had tiny immigrant communities since trade began. Deptford, near London&rsquo;s docks, is an example.</p>
<p>Look at any early film or photograph of ordinary British people to see how the balance has really changed.</p>

		<p>All this does is show how futile it is to try and civilize Africans. If Africans have been exposed to some of the greatest civilizations in the last five thousands years and still haven&rsquo;t learned from them what do we expect to accomplish by importing them in the present day. </p>

		<p>I imagine that political correctness Nazis will be rushing in every direction, declaring that England (and by default all of Europe) were settled by blacks and in fact, Europeans are part African! Thus, Europe is the homeland of blacks too and they deserve it just as much as Europeans do! </p>
<p>One, I question the credibility of this find but let&rsquo;s give them the benefit of the doubt and say this is a real, 100 percent black skeleton. </p>
<p>So we find one black skeleton in a Roman cemetery in England. That must mean vast numbers of Africans settled England right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Rome was a vast international empire that had many ethnic groups (which would later bring on its downfall or at least contribute to its destruction), and England was a major trade region. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me that blacks (slaves or traders) might pass through to get goods or make deals, but I don&rsquo;t think thousands (or even hundreds) of Africans settled permanently in England. He was probably just a trader or slave that passed away. He was likely one of the &ldquo;foreign guys&rdquo; in the town. He wasn&rsquo;t English.</p>
<p>Also, why are the British so quick to show off shaky findings but they won&rsquo;t even whisper the slightest mention of ancient white bodies found in China and Egypt.</p>
<p>However, even if these articles didn&rsquo;t exist, the English elite would still be worshipping at the altar of anti white hatred and praising blacks for their ingenious contributions to England like the rape increase or social decline. <br>

Those are interesting photos. According to DNA research, over 100,000 years ago modern humans evolved in Africa. About 65,000 years ago, 100 to 200 of them crossed the Sinai Peninsula. Everyone who is not an African black is descended from them. <br>
 <br>
What seems to have happened is that after the evolution of the Caucasian race, and after Caucasians invented agriculture, Caucasian farmers crossed back across the Sinai Peninsula, replacing the blacks they found in northern Africa. After that, the Sahara Desert served as a barrier against race mixing.   </p>

		<p>I, too, have been surprised at the &#8220;whiteness&#8221; of many North Africans I have met over my life, but remember, both Algeria and Tunisia had millions of French (Algeria and Tunisia) and Italians (Tunisia) up to about 1960.  When I was in Catholic grammar school in the very early &rsquo;60s there was a family of girls four of them) that came to our school - all very pretty - and we were told they were French, who had emigrated from Tunis.  Actually, looking back on it, their last name was Italian, but they had French first names - their ancestors had probably been there for a hundred years.  I have since met a number of blue-eyed North Africans, who, frankly, looked European, and could pass for Italian or French.</p>
