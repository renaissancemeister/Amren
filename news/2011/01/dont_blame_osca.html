			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Javier E. David, The Grio, January 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The Academy Award nominations for 2010 were just announced, and as expected, they did not contain a single black nominee in any of the major categories  &mdash;  the first time this has happened in roughly a decade, and certainly since Halle Berry and Denzel Washington simultaneously won the top honors in 2002. This is a curious development, considering that the movie industry relentlessly promotes its cultural sensitivity and political correctness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No doubt the Oscars&rsquo; overlooking of black industry players this year will come in for sharp criticism, accompanied by hand-wringing and amorphous pledges to do better. Yet the ensuing platitudes are likely to omit a very important detail: with a few notable exceptions, 2010 was a figurative wasteland for black cinema.</p>
<p>By no means should this imply that quality black films do not exist  &mdash;  plenty do, and the industry is replete with examples of excellent movies with black actors and directors at the helm. {snip} Suffice to say, most well-made black movies are hard-pressed to find financial success and mainstream accolades.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not difficult to fathom why. A thoughtful 2009 New York Times article accurately detailed the state of contemporary black cinema and what continues to hamper its development. {snip} Hollywood continues to view black moviegoers through a woefully circumscribed prism. To them, black movies are less mainstream products than they are niche. And let&rsquo;s be frank: the overwhelming majority of black consumers give them ample reason for doing so.</p>
<p>Alas, much like the eternal debate over mainstream music, movies are a function of stark economics and financial viability. Ultimately, what gets green-lighted is a reflection of the public&rsquo;s willingness to pay. While Tyler Perry&rsquo;s movies have received more than their fair share of criticism, black audiences clearly respond to his brand of (urban) humor. Regardless of Hollywood&rsquo;s oft exaggerated insistence on creativity and its art house pretensions, movie making is a business. As such, industry participants expect to receive a sizable return on their investment in a film. Given how expensive movies are to make nowadays, that&rsquo;s not an unreasonable expectation.</p>
<p>Advocates for black film will likely fault the Academy for their perceived snub of black artists. Truthfully, however, the Oscars are notorious for a clubby, culturally highbrow worldview that bestows its imprimatur on unknown vanity pieces (The Hurt Locker, anyone?). More often than not, they tend to shun movies, black or white, that hew to mainstream tastes.</p>
<p>{snip} This year&rsquo;s omission of black actors should be a wake-up call to moviegoers: start patronizing better movies, and Hollywood will be forced to take notice.<br>

		<p>What turns me off movies with black actors is that the general theme is the struggle against white racism.Movies like &#8220;in the heat of the night&#8221; or &#8220;The hurricane&#8221;  can become rather tedious after a while.</p>

		<p>Why should the Motion Picture Academy apologize to blacks?  </p>
<p>There happened to be a lot of terrific movies last year that had a white cast.  What is this, an afirmative action plan?  Blacks already have won their share of Best Actor awards   &mdash;   see Denzel Washington (&#8220;Training Day,&#8221; 2001), Jamie Foxx (&#8220;Ray,&#8221; 2004) and Forest Whitaker (&#8220;The Last King of Scotland,&#8221; 2006).  What the does the Academy have to do to appease these &#8220;civil rights&#8221; clowns?  </p>
<p>Nice to see Jeff Bridges, by the way, get another Best Actor nod for the Coens&rsquo; remake of &#8220;True Grit.&#8221;  Winning it last year for &#8220;Crazy Heart&#8221; (country music   &mdash;   uh oh&hellip;white people music) was very cool.   </p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t they have that obese, ebonics speaking woman name &#8220;Mo&rsquo;nique&#8221; announce some of the Oscar nominees? Isn&rsquo;t that diversity enough? And the moviegoers are to blame for this? So We should start to partonize movies with lots of blacks in them! I for one do the exact opposite; I will especially avoid films or shows if the black(s) in it are known to act crude and trashy. </p>

		<p>Has anyone else noticed that black movies produced and directed by blacks are chock-full of stereotyped depictions of black attitudes and behavior that would have black moviegoers screaming &#8216;racism&rsquo; and &#8216;disrespect&rsquo; if the producers and directors were white? <br>

<p>We DID patronize the better movies.  They just happened to NOT be black movies.  And who does this person think they are to tell the movie going public what movies they should go see?  Arrogant and full of yourself much?  I think I&rsquo;ll decide what movies I go see.</p>

		<p>If I were a black actor, I would actually consider it a racist insult to have been nominated for an Oscar for performing in last year&rsquo;s crop of crummy movies.  That would be like saying that I&rsquo;m the fastest minnow in the wading pool.</p>

There is too much to discuss in this one. I would have to do a breakdown line-for-line to say everything I wanted to say. I will therefore keep it short.</p>
<p>If blacks want more (quality) movies for blacks, written by blacks, acted by blacks, directed by blacks, produced by blacks, distributed by blacks then do it yourself!</p>
<p>Every few years, blacks complain so loud that Hollywood makes a special effort to make a couple black films. Even it they&rsquo;re good, they make little profit for the studios. Then Hollywood goes back to making films that will make them money; white movies, with largely white casts, and a few blacks thrown in to add &#8216;street cred&rsquo;, (diversity).</p>
<p>If black films were as in demand as we&rsquo;re told and proven money makers, WHY are blacks demanding WHITE studios make and profit from producing black films?</p>
<p>The answer is obvious. Blacks don&rsquo;t make black films because black films don&rsquo;t sell in the marketplace. Blacks want white studios to lose their money on films few people will be interested in.</p>

		<p>  Give us one reason that movies such as Lottery Ticket, I can do bad all by myself (or any Tyler Perry flick that seems to be released out of nowhere every month) to receive such credicle honor and recognition? <br>
Actors such as Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington, and Samuel L. Jackson are in mostly quality movies that earn some particular form of oscar nomination.</p>
<p>But everyone think about this one: <br>
What does everyone notice in the kind of movies those three actors are in&hellip;compared to those that star celebs such as Ice-T, Ice Cube, and 50 Cent? Yes folks, anyone would know the answer to that one!</p>
<p>If they want blacks to take over the Oscars, just remake the movie &#8220;Roots&#8221;&hellip;and how in the world would liberals, media, the left, or especially black critics pan that movie? </p>

		<p>Could the current economic down-turn be playing a role in this?</p>
<p>Ultra-liberal Hollywood still needs to make money, they can&rsquo;t do that during a recession and still be able to cater to every Black whim.</p>
<p>The bad economy is brining many racial issues into stark relief.  Without the narcotizing effect of mass consumerism, reality is more easily comprehended.  </p>
<p>Also one wonders if already criminally prone and immoral Blacks are more likely to pirate films, thus making Black films less profitable in the end?: <i>&#8216;Homes gots &#8216;dis def copy o&rsquo; The Blindside dat Ize just burned onto DVD bro, fo-git paying benjaminz to the Man, yo!!&rsquo;</i></p>

		<p>It might be the Cuba Gooding Jr effect.  His Oscar was very definitely undeserved.  His career has gone downhill ever since and he now barely appears in B movies.  Back then Hollywood was desperate to give an Oscar to a black and he won for basically jumping up and down yelling &#8220;show me the money.&#8221;  Its not good when Oscar winners become the butt of jokes.  </p>

		<p>Homey has passion for many, many things but his reluctance in supporting them financially is legendary and undeniable.  Cinema is no different.  Take a look at the crowd of any major sporting event.  Support is non existent even when 75 to 80% of the players look just like he does.</p>
<p>Homey loves Red Lobster too but when the check gets brought over the server will thank Jesus if the tip is more than 75 cents.</p>
<p>With Homey History Month just around the corner I propose the first Fri-Sun be designated &#8220;Bell Curve Weekend&#8221;  with particular emphasis on low IQ, raucous vulgar behavior, blaming Whitey for Katrina(and everything else), and poor personal hygiene.

		<p>We have been boycotting Hollywood for over ten years. The nice thing about NetFlix and your local library is that you can order so many classics. We have enjoyed seeing all the Hitchcock movies, many older westerns (The Searchers for example), and most of the Cary Grant romantic comedies. These are worth watching. We also enjoy watching many of the mysteries that were produced by British television over the last 30 years. Best of all, most of these are available for free from your local library. The stuff produced by contemporary Hollywood is not worth viewing.</p>
<p>By the way, while checking out the movies and TV mysteries at your local library, don&rsquo;t forget to pick up a few good books. Especially some of the American classics if you have not read them. I strongly recommend Huckleberry Finn and some contemporary non-fiction such as the Apache Diaries. There is also a very, very excellent new book about the deception pulled on the Nazis by the British in WWII. Operation Mincemeat is the story of how a false identity was created for a body that fooled the Nazis into thinking DDay would occur somewhere else&hellip;its a GOOD read!</p>
<p>As far as GOOD, accurate historical fiction filled with action, check out the Patrick O&rsquo;Brien series of novels about &#8220;Lucky Jack&#8221; Aubrey of the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. The movie Master and Commander was based on this series. There are 20 novels in this series and they are far, far better than the movie. O&rsquo;Brien will make you smell the gunpowder and feel the wind in your face! You can almost hear &#8220;Bouncing Betty&#8221;, old &#8220;Willful Murder&#8221;, and the other cannons roar.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t watch black movies or even movies with major black characters in them.  Samuel Jackson, Queen Latifa, Cuba Gooding, etc. serve as warning beacons on my do not watch list.  I was flipping through the TV channels a few months ago and stumbled upon this civil war movie showing a scene with some mulatto slave woman in in a barn having her blouse ripped off by a White Confederate Officer.  I think the whole purpose of it was to show black women as some kind of sex objects.  The acting was so bad instead of getting angry it made me laugh out loud by the ridiculousness of it.  Black women were even less appealing back then than they are now so I seriously doubt there very many White men forcing themselves on them.  I also doubt any of these black women had plastic surgery, wore wigs and blue contact lenses like the actress in this movie. </p>

Since you like old movies, I can recommend the fine film version of Operation Mincemeat from 1956, titled &#8220;The Man Who Never Was&#8221;:</p>

<p>Surprisingly for a British movie of that period, it&rsquo;s in color. <br>
