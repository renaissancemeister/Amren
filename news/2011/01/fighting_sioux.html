			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Valerie Richardson, Washington Times, January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When North Dakota&rsquo;s state board of higher education voted to phase out the &#8220;Fighting Sioux&#8221; last year, that seemed to signal the end of the lengthy battle over the University of North Dakota&rsquo;s nickname and logo.</p>
<p>Except that it didn&rsquo;t. Two Fighting Sioux supporters have since launched Save Our Suhaki, a tongue-in-cheek campaign ostensibly aimed at preserving the suhaki, a Russian antelope whose name is pronounced exactly like &#8220;Sioux hockey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lest anyone miss the parallel, an editor&rsquo;s note on the website says, &#8220;Suhaki (soo-ha-kee) is often times mistaken for a legendary collegiate ice hockey team located in the Ralph Englestad Arena, Grand Forks, North Dakota, United States of America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steve Ekman, an alumnus who organized the campaign along with fellow North Dakotan Hans Halvorson, called the campaign a &#8220;peaceful and poignant protest against the politically correct NCAA.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State lawmakers also have jumped into the fray by introducing three bills that would override the board&rsquo;s vote and write the 80-year-old nickname and logo into state law. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, House Majority Leader Al Carlson says he&rsquo;s willing to consider adding the Fighting Sioux to the state constitution.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Carlson&rsquo;s bill would prevent the university and board from taking any action to remove the Fighting Sioux.</p>
<p>If the NCAA threatens to penalize the university over its use of the nickname, the state attorney general &#8220;shall consider filing a federal antitrust investigation against that association.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One potential hurdle: The state constitution already says that the board of education &#8220;shall have full authority over the institutions under its control.&#8221;</p>
<p>The debate over the Fighting Sioux has waged since the NCAA placed the nickname on a list of &#8220;hostile and abusive&#8221; Indian mascots in 2005. Schools were ordered to replace their mascots or receive permission from their namesake tribes to continue using them. Any university that refused would face sanctions.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Enquirer (Cincinnati), January 19, 2011 </i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Miami University in Ohio will no longer allow its Indian-head logo to be used on merchandise sold on or off campus, university officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Miami has told merchandising companies the logo will no longer be available for reproduction after the current supply of merchandise is sold.</p>
<p>University trustees voted in 1996 to stop using the name Redskins as its athletic nickname, citing respect for the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma. The school adopted the current RedHawks nickname in 1997, but allowed limited use of a logo incorporating an Indian head and the beveled letter &#8220;M&#8221; on some apparel and in some athletic areas as a &#8220;heritage mark&#8221; related to the school&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand why they&rsquo;re doing it, but it&rsquo;s part of the heritage of Miami. And by doing away with it, they&rsquo;re losing history,&#8221; Miami sophomore Taylor Lewis said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Miami was named for the Miami Indians who once lived in what is now southwest Ohio. The university has said the tribe had asked the school to stop using the 66-year-old name over concerns that some people perceive it as a racial slur.</p>

I wonder how they got away with using the word &#8216;warpath&rsquo; in the title. That should cause an uproar.</p>
<p><i>Miami was named for the Miami Indians who once lived in what is now southwest Ohio. The university has said the tribe had asked the school to stop using the 66-year-old name over concerns that some people perceive it as a racial slur.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known very few Indians in my life but I got along particularly well with a woman who actually lived on a reservation. She refereed to herself as Indian. I wondered, but never asked her, why she didn&rsquo;t use the PC term Native American. She seemed very comfortable with the word Indian.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t see a racial slur in any of this. I would be proud to be on a team called the White Skins. That&rsquo;s the interesting aspect of this. Even though I and others would be proud of such a team name, it would never be allowed.<br>

		<p>From a strictly multicultural point of view, the diverse white American peoples are benefited by the removal of celebratory events and icons that commemorate other demographics.  Personally, I don&rsquo;t understand why American Indians (if this campaign of removal is from that demographic) want to be disappeared this way.</p>
<p>I hope it doesn&rsquo;t spread to the European American community.  We need to save and maintain all the symbols and signs that commemorate our cultures and histories.</p>
<p>If I were an American Indian, I think I would want those mascots preserved and use them as leverage to get 500 full-ride scholarships for young American Indians, instead of trying to destroy those last few signs of their predominance on this continent.  We need to remember as diverse white people that this is someone else&rsquo;s fight.  We have our own fights.</p>

<p>I beg to differ. As an American of Scandinavian descent, I am positively sick of seeing sports teams calling themselves &#8216;Vikings&rsquo; paraded about. My culture and history are neither being represented or honored by this -are yours? If they want to be thin skinned and litigious about Their cultural icons, I see no reason we should tolerate the further denigration of ours.</p>

<p>Even if you were able to create 500 full-ride scholarships [and the idea is a good idea], you would probably only have a small portion of those scholarship openings even taken, and only an even smaller portion of those taking the openings ever graduating. Sad but very true.</p>

		<p>Back from the period of WW2 we have the &#8220;Tribal&#8221; class of British destroyers.</p>
<p>Names of &#8220;tribes&#8221; from the world-over. Fighting tribes noted for their valor and ferocity in combat.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_class_destroyer_(1936)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_class_destroyer_(1936)</a></p>
<p>To include:</p>
<p>Maori - - New Zealand. Afridi - - Pashtun. Bedouin - - Arabia. AND Mohawk - - U.S. and Canada. Among many.</p>
<p>I guess that sort of naming would not be allowed today?</p>

		<p>Think about it.  Why would whites want to name anything having to do with American Indians who are overall losers in everything.<br>
They lost the battles and wars (against Custer is a rare exception), are mostly alcoholics, non-achievers academically and unstable socially.</p>
<p>I think most schools are looking at American Indian names and logos the wrong way.  Get rid of them all.</p>

		<p>The Miami tribe, originally from OH, IN, and parts of IL, heavily intermarried with local whites, even before relocation to western reservations from the 1830-1840s.  The last Miami community before relocation was in Indiana, where a few were able to evade authorities and others left the reservation and returned.  Their descedents today form the unrecognized Eastern Miami Tribe of Indiana, which formally proclaimed itself a tribe in the late 1970s and today consists of some 5,000 &#8220;tribal members&#8221;.  Unless they told you, you wouldn&rsquo;t know that they or the western Miamis were even Indian - they appear to be completely white.  Morever, the Miamis are some of the most sensitive and vocal about racism against Indians.  I wonder how many of the complaints over racist symbols come from similar &#8220;tribes&#8221;.</p>

		<p>#2 bo Sears makes some great points. I was thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>On a different note, it&rsquo;s interesting to consider the parallels between how the Colonel was removed from Ole Miss versus how the Indian mascots are being removed from other schools. Someone could probably right a very interesting essay on that.</p>

		<p>The Seminoles will remain as the proud symbol for Florida State University.  The reason?  The Seminoles want it that way, that&rsquo;s why.  The Seminole Tribe in Florida is happy to share in the recognition and the scholarship opportunities.  Besides, the Seminoles never signed a peace treaty with the US and would rather fight on the sports fields these days.  The Seminole Hard Rock Cafe and Casino, various other casinos, smoke shops and related enterprises have made this issue of mascot a stupid one.  Due to the publicity, the Seminoles in Fl have never had it better and do have it better than other residents of the State.  The NCAA was told by the Seminoles to get lost and the collegiate organization were forced to make an exception to their 2005 ruling.  </p>

		<p>Years ago, a Native American, Hispanic intermural basketball team at the University of Northern Colorado changed its name to &#8220;Fighting Whites&#8221; to protest the use of College teams using Indian mascots. The result was not anger from white basketball fans, but overwhelming approval! I remember several comments on blogs at the time: &#8220;at last a team I can totally support&#8221;, &#8220;I support whites and always have&#8221;, etc. This certainly shows that whites are not touchy about how they are depicted in sports. </p>

		<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t realize that we give these teams these mascots because we respect such real Indian tribes for the fight they put up against us, even though they did not win in the long run.  Think about it:  The military has an Apache helicopter, but no Pueblo helicopter.  UND&rsquo;s sports teams are the Fighting Sioux, not the Fighting Sac-and-Fox.</p>

		<p>I just wish someone could ban the Washington Redskins name. For once let these government bullies get a taste of their own medicine. Most of the government drones in DC are probably Redskin fans, yet the federal government tacitly gives its&rsquo; approval to this PC behavior of banning Indian names.</p>

		<p>The Indians do this because it makes them look like they are being persecuted and are &#8220;hard done by&#8221; by the White society. Money and publicity is all they are after. They have learned to play the victim card quite well. If it gets the Ire of those that really care about the sports teams is another factor. If it were up to me I would give them exactly what they want and get rid of all the Indian sports names and logo&rsquo;s because in fact they love them. Up in Northern Canada where I live half the sports hats and jackets and jerseys the Indians wear are Chicago Blackhawks, Washington Redskins, Cleveland Indians etc. </p>
