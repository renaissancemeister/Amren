<h1>Knife and Gun Crime Levels Match London&rsquo;s Changing Demographics</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BNP, January 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some 3,295 gun crimes and 12,611 knife crimes took place in London during 2009, latest figures from the Metropolitan Police Crime Summary (MPCS) have shown, a figure which directly parallels the growth in the Third World immigrant population of Britain&rsquo;s capital.</p>
<p>According to the MPCS figures, the number of &#8220;gun-enabled crimes&#8221; has risen from 2,961 in 199 to 3,295 in 2009 and the number of &#8220;knife-enabled crimes&#8221; for the period 2003 to 2009  &mdash;  10 rose from 10,305 to 12,611.</p>
<p>London boroughs with the highest rates of gun and knife crime include Newham, Southwark, Hackney, Islington, Waltham Forest and Lambeth </p>
<p>The number of rapes and homophobic crimes in London also rose by about a quarter over the past year. There were 2,646 rapes and 1,319 homophobic crimes in London during 2009, which translate into increases of 24.2 and 26.9 percent respectively. In total, there were 832,439 crimes recorded in London in 2009.</p>
<p>In June 2010, the Sunday Telegraph, through a Freedom of Information Act request, obtained statistics on accusations of crime broken down by race from the Metropolitan Police Service. </p>
<p>The figures showed that the majority of males who were accused of violent and sexual crimes (including those subsequently acquitted) in 2009  &mdash;  10 were black.</p>
<p>Of the recorded 18,091 such accusations against males, 54 percent accused of street crimes were black; for robbery, 59 percent; for gun crimes, 67 percent; and for sexual offences, 32 percent.</p>
<p>Street crimes include muggings, assault with intent to rob, and snatching property. Black males accounted for 29 percent of the male victims of gun crime and 24 percent of the male victims of knife crime. </p>
<p>Similar statistics were recorded for females. For knife crime, 45 percent of suspected female perpetrators were black; for gun crime, 58 percent; and for robberies, 52 percent.</p>
<p>The prevalence of immigrant crime has reached such proportions that the Metropolitan Police was forced to set up Operation Trident in March 1998 to specifically focus on black gun crime.</p>
<p>In addition, between April 2005 and January 2006, figures from the Metropolitan Police Service showed that black people accounted for 46 percent of car-crime arrests generated by automatic number plate recognition cameras.</p>
<p>British whites are still a bare majority of London&rsquo;s population but are already a minority of the under 25 population  &mdash;  precisely the population group linked to the knife and gun crime plague.</p>
<p>Figures released by the Department for Children, Schools and Families last year show that Asians make up the majority of young children in several areas of London. The rise in homophobic attacks is clearly linked to the increase in the Muslim population of London.</p>
<p>In Newham, just under 12 per cent of primary pupils are white British, while in Brent&rsquo;s secondaries 93 percent are nonwhite.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t like the weasel phrases &#8220;gun crime&#8221; and &#8220;knife crime.&#8221;  The British media seem to use it universally.  They even referred to the Tucson suspect as a &#8220;gun criminal.&#8221;  And evidently, it&rsquo;s so erroneously ingrained into the British psyche that the BNP&rsquo;s writers use it.</p>
<p>In the last several days, I have read at least three stories in the Daily Mail about really violent &#8220;flash&#8221; incidents involving blacks and guns, all of them in London.  Now, the country at large has draconian gun control, London even more so, and the London Police have a big permanent bureaucracy (&#8220;Trident&#8221;) to deal with guns.  Doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working out so well.</p>

		<p>I think a lot of American whitey have a big problem with this stuff. The rate of crime now in Europe and many of the constituent nations is now EVEN HIGHER than it is in the U.S.</p>
<p>And nations that prior to WW2 and for some time there after were almost exclusively whitey are not only NOT that now but in some areas resemble the &#8220;ghetto&#8221; areas of the U.S.</p>
<p>This is astounding to most whitey American?</p>
<p>The Europe that our ancestors left generations ago now is LONG GONE and never will be again?</p>
<p>And that means everywhere on the continent [that includes England for you whose ancestors came from England].</p>

		<p>Whenever you hear the words &#8216;Asian&rsquo; and &#8216;crime&rsquo; (or some form or variant of the word), you can almost be certain they&rsquo;re referring to Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims.  This makes me very mad, as American readers would have the impression that Japanese and Korean &#8216;youths&rsquo; were causing a massive problem in the UK.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching my knife all day, and thus far, it did not commit any crimes.  I&rsquo;m still waiting.  Just to be sure, I&rsquo;ll watch it again, carefully, tomorrow.  </p>
<p>If my knife commits any crimes, I&rsquo;ll immediately report it to the proper authorities.</p>

<p>I totally agree with you here, the correct term to use relative to the Paki and Bangle criminals is MUSLIM! MUSLIM! MUSLIM! NOT Asian. I believe White Brits know the difference but as usual, the media is afraid of outraging the muslims. The blacks there are from Africa, Trinidad, Jamaica, Tobago and other former colonies and they are just plain nasty! Ethiopians and Somalis are all over England too, must be the welfare and taxis!</p>

Yes, I know what you mean.  But it&rsquo;s not just (North) American readers who would immediately think of orientals when the description &#8216;Asian&rsquo; is mentioned.</p>
<p>We here in Australia would never refer to an Indian, Pakistani, etc as &#8216;Asian&rsquo;, although they are certainly from that &#8216;wonderful&rsquo; continent of Asia.</p>
<p>I lived in London for a short while and found it strange that British people referred to Indians, etc as &#8216;Asians&rsquo;.  When I heard this, I was looking around for a Chinese, Vietnamese, etc person.</p>
<p>Best wishes from Oz to our British cousins and all proud white nations on this day, 26th January - Australia Day (a day where its traditional meaning has been highjacked by the multicultural industry and the enemies within our borders to promote their evil).     </p>

		<p>Local TV news reports these days in London are usually little more than a roll-call litany of last night&rsquo;s toll of young feral blacks stabbing or shooting themselves or others.<br>
  Even if you go back in time 25 years ago, when the demographic impact of young blacks still was muted, such crimes were rare.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Gun crime,&#8221; knife crime,&#8221; as if the inanimate tools, not the perps, were responsible. Socialist Blighty has gone through the looking glass. Their demonization of firearms is surreal. I recall reading an article where one of their MSM minions was invited to discharge a rifle at an American shooting range. The dutiful little thing cranked off a round and then claimed to have been overcome by revulsion and shame. The only force that can save Britain now is the British National Party&hellip;and whether they can pull it off without a paroxysm of violence remains to be seen. </p>

		<p> Formerly Great Britain is the only country I know that uses the term: &#8220;knife crime&#8221;, as though the knife is responsible for the crime. I honestly believe that British liberal Multi-culturalists would blame any increase of crime on too many pieces of table cutlery or too many Boy Scout knifes in children&rsquo;s hands. It seems like everything and everyone is guilty (society, parents, guns, knives, racists, poor self-image, poverty) but the persons who actually commit the crime.   </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s gotten much worse there in the last decade, and it will continue to deteriorate, as it will here in this country and throughout the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>For how long the people will put up with the schemes contrived by leftist elites to continue flooding the UK with third world hordes depends on how long the country is able to stave off its day of reckoning with its huge debt obligations. </p>
<p>Whites who are financially comfortable will tolerate an encroachment of aliens who disrespect them and their way of life, and the loss of many of their freedoms and even severe restrictions placed on them, but nothing has such a sobering effect than the loss of assets, and a bleak future promising more of the same. </p>

		<p>The term &#8220;Asian&#8221;,while in many ways rather vague applies as much to people from the Indian sub-continent as it does to Chinese and Koreans.It is worth noting that &#8220;Asia&#8221; originally referred to the then Greek-occupied region of Anatolia,and that while there are substantial numbers of east asians present in the UK,their numbers(and attendant problems) are nothing compared to those whom Americans would call south asians. </p>

		<p>@Wulfstan, why do you have to clump Indians with Pakistanis and Bangladeshis?  What kind of &#8216;attendant problems&rsquo; did Indians bring to UK? I would think Indians in UK are as law abiding as the &#8216;Chinese and Koreans&rsquo;.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  Anonymous (8)</p>
<p>I watched my claymore and Sayaka&rsquo;s naginata today, and they didn&rsquo;t do anything except hang out on the wall over the fireplace together.  Maybe they like one another!  The coilgun might have been muttering to itself in its basement safe, but with it unloaded and the sodium-sulfur batteries and Faraday wheel disconnected in their pack and sitting in the other safe, I very much doubt it.  The bread knife in the kitchen was quite peaceful and didn&rsquo;t seem to particularly want to cut bread.  I quite doubt it cared one way or another.</p>
<p>The sort of magical superstition that passed for &#8220;thinking&#8221; in Medieval Europe often blamed inanimate objects for their criminal or accidental misuse.  Sadly, this appears current in the irrational, post-Enlightenment UK-istan.</p>

		<p>What is happening in Great Britain goes to show that gun control does not work.  When guns are banned for all law-abiding citizens, criminals can simply buy them illegally.  </p>
<p>In our country, people banned from owning guns, such as convicted felons and persons dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces, can simply go to the illegal market and buy guns with no questions asked.  And career criminals know where to buy them illegally!</p>
<p>There is more crime in Great Britain, where guns are banned, than in Switzerland, where gun ownership is mandatory!</p>
<p>To everyone reading this post, I urge all of you to join pro-2nd Amendment rights organizations such as the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, and Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership. </p>
<p> You do not even have to be Jewish to join JFPO.  Many members of this organization are not Jewish.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of problems did Indians bring to the U.K.?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well like all racial minorities, loss of national character and culture. Dilution of national identity and heritage. Feelings of alienation from the indigenous British in the areas where they settle. A racially cohesive society is always more problem-free then one that is not.  </p>
