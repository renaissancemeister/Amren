<h1><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-turn/2011/01/the_us_commission_on_civil.html">New Black Panther Party Case: The Facts Are In</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post, January 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights came out in December with a draft of its interim report on the New Black Panthers Party scandal. Earlier today a final report was posted on the commission&rsquo;s website, and with it, a flurry of rebuttals and separate statements from a number of the commissioners. The import of these statements should not be minimized. </p>
<p>The statements indicate several points: 1) the New Black Panther Party case brought by career Justice Department employees was meritorious on the law and the facts; 2) there is voluminous evidence of the Obama administration&rsquo;s political interference in the prosecution of the New Black Panther Party case; 3) there is ample evidence that the Obama administration directed Justice Department employees not to bring cases against minority defendants who violated voting rights laws or to enforce a provision requiring that states and localities clean up their voting rolls to prevent fraud; 4) the Justice Department stonewalled efforts to investigate the case; and 5) vice chairman Abigail Thernstrom has, for reasons not entirely clear, ignored the evidence and tried to undermine the commission&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Woven throughout these documents is a blistering rebuttal of the statements of Democratic commissioners who have done their best to ignore or misconstrue evidence, come up with belated and fanciful theories that not even the DOJ raised, and to vilify the career attorneys who came forward to provide sworn testimony.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And now the commission passes its findings on to Congress, specifically the new chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) I suspect he will pick up where the commission left off and demand the stonewalling come to an end.<br>

		<p>Obstruction of justice   &mdash;   That&rsquo;s exactly what brought Nixon down.  And that was the important part of the David Frost interview of Nixon three years later   &mdash;   Frost got Nixon to confess to committing the Federal felony crimes of OOJ, mail fraud and money laundering.  Not anything about contrition or feeling sorry.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal?  Black governance is always characterized by wholesale corruption, racial preference, and a complete disregard for the rule of law. This holds whether we&rsquo;re talking about a city, state, or federal governing body, be it here in the US or in some black African hell-hole.</p>
<p>Obama and his henchmen are just being themselves.</p>

		<p>  Good, let the DOJ do more to show White Humanity how dispossessed we are, even and especially of our equal protection under the law.  </p>
<p>Worse is better. </p>
<p>Every day, more and more Whites, especially Yankees up North, are waking up to the failures of Importation, Abolition, Emancipation, Citizenship, Enfranchisement, Equality, Anti-Discrimination, Equal Housing, Civil Rights, Affirmative Action, Universal Values, Diversity and Inclusion, Social and Restorative Justice, Multicultural Sensitivity, Tolerance and Change, Radical Hospitality, Embracing Differences, and whatever will be the next code phrase for White Dispossession and Degradation.</p>
<p>Our chances of seeing widespread acceptance of White Rights and Race Reality are getting better every day.  Don&rsquo;t look for much to come from the Tea Party, but they are a healthy and much welcomed reactionary movement helping us march in the right direction.   </p>
<p>Look for a flash point event that will bring millions to our side and permanently reshape the way we allow the word &#8220;racism&#8221; to be used.</p>
<p>Whites Humanity will start to force negotiations upon the minorities:  Before we do more for you, you must show progress toward safety and peace for all Citizens, and without that, you are on your own.  Call us racist.  We don&rsquo;t care. If a racist is someone who wants you to police your own &#8220;communities of color,&#8221; then we proudly wear the label.</p>
<p>Whites will start making demand of blacks every time blacks complain about anything.  We are moving toward a better future when Whites recover their sanity and start saying &#8220;NO<br>

		<p>So, other than an internal cat fight between Abigail Thernstrom (&#8216;friend to Bill Clinton on Race&rsquo;, big surprise&hellip;) and the Commission itself, is there any purpose to this tail chaising?</p>
<p>Having read both the initial article and Mrs. Thernstrom&rsquo;s &#8220;Yeah, it might have been wrong, so what&hellip;?&#8221; rebuttal-</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/7KaBW</p>
<p>It looks to me like there is something bigger being covered here than a couple thugs playing bully pulpit at voter center.  Like redistricting based on jailed, dead or moved voters.</p>
<p>And Obama buy-in on that in a couple key states.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s real or not depends on the results of a fishing expedition which, thus far, nobody has been able to trump Justice department &#8216;privilege&rsquo; in obtaining.</p>
<p>That is the -only- reason I can see for the NBP case to sit in limbo like this.  Because it is the opening thread in a tear that goes high and wide based on a special investigator status access to the affected memos and statements.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s Obama playing racial solidarity or Obama playing political conspiracy to get elected, the fact remains that until this case leaves the procedural and enters the real in terms of viewed evidence and full Congressional judicial committee review, there is no purpose in this institutional head-butting.</p>
<p>Get some balls, get the proof or go home.</p>
<p>We have bigger fish to fry.</p>

		<p>If it is shown and proven that a sitting President directly interfered in the investigation of a possible voting rights crime, and indeed did instruct his federal minions to purposely ignore and NOT prosecute civil rights crimes against a majority segment of his nation&rsquo;s population, can we FINALLY say that is an impeachable offense?  Can we finally charge and try this anti-American, anti-consitutional marxist thug according to clear laws contained in the constitution?  And get RID of him?  If not, why not.</p>

		<p>Apparently standing in front of a polling place with billyclubs and aggressive threatening postures is not enough for Atty General Holder to take action. </p>
<p>The New Black Panthers is the group a leader of which said, &#8220;you got to kill some crackers.  You got to kill they babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know it is a tired refrain, but substitute the anti-white epithets for anti-black epithets coming from the mouths of white people.  The white people would get Life In Prison.</p>
<p>Aw heck, if there were 3 well dressed white Christian men holding Bibles and expressions of love for the people walking into the polling place, the whites would likely face jail time when the African Americans complained they were being harassed.</p>
<p>What has happened to America?</p>

Look at all the examples and scenarios where blacks constantly get away with negative actions towards white&rsquo;s who could never do to blacks without being charged with a hate crime?

		<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, Obama &amp; Company are racist. This is not surprising. To them we (whites) are the enemy and this is something that should not be forgotten in the next election.</p>
<p>Sadly, lots of whites will vote Obama regardless. Might as well be a Jew voting for Hitler.</p>

		<p>Wonderful. Now we have court authorized anti-white behavior.  What a total joke our courts have become! </p>
<p>To defend a violent group such as the black panthers simply because they are &ldquo;black&rdquo; is true racism. Unfortunately, for whites, racism police only feel that whites can commit such crimes.</p>
<p>If the courts won&rsquo;t protect our rights, who will?  <br>

		<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d see the day when I would have so little respect for our Justice Department. Since they have so little respect for me and my kind. Giving a pass to criminals because they&rsquo;re from a minority race is not justice. Mass media burying stories because the victims are white is also a travesty of justice. And to add insult to injury, they will vilify the people who are only doing their jobs and telling the truth. Disgusting.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to hear what Rep. Lamar Smith does with this mess. Commission&rsquo;s findings? More like commission&rsquo;s fiction. Our stonewalling D.O.J., courtesy of Obama&rsquo;s depraved<br>
administration.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen parts of the video, not the whole thing, and I wasn&rsquo;t there. The &#8216;intimidation&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t really that bad and too much of a big deal is being made out of it. This white man would have voted. Yes the perps should have been given a fine, or rather community service. Perhaps a bigger deal is being made out of it because those standing near the voting station with uniforms and clubs were members of a larger group. The Clinton appointee claimed this was the worst voting rights violation he had ever seen in 30 years but that&rsquo;s only by viewing it in a &#8216;evil whitey&rsquo; prism of seeing a big deal out of very little. </p>
<p>To ignore the incident itself however, for a moment. When you say they should have gotten away with it because of historic injustice, is to continue to sell this notion of white evil and black innocence. A notion that&rsquo;s intended to shut up and make light of the million white victims of black crime and violence each year and the accompanying racial favoritism, by both the law and those who report on the law, favoritism towards people of color at the expense of whites. This world where whites can only be bad or racist may have been true 50 years ago, before the civil rights movement (but I don&rsquo;t even believe that).</p>

		<p>To see whether or not there&rsquo;s a double-standard, let&rsquo;s just do a little thought experiment. Let&rsquo;s assume that rather than two blacks in NBBP uniforms holding billy clubs outside a polling station and saying that they were &#8220;security&#8221;, there were two whites doing the same thing (changing the uniforms, of course). Does anyone think that Holder would have refrained from prosecuting this case?</p>

<p>Other interesting thought experiments: If the Jena Six had been white, and Justin Barker had been black, whose side do you think Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and MSM would have been on?</p>
<p>If the Duke Lacrosse players had been black, and the woman who accused them of raping her had been white, how much attention do you think the media would have paid to the case before the accusations were shown to be false, compared to after?</p>
