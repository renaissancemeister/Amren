			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AOL News, January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. Paul LePage changed his Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend plans and showed up at a breakfast honoring the slain civil rights leader Monday, days after he said critics of his decision to skip other events could &#8220;kiss my butt.&#8221; He even joined some of the participants in an African dance.</p>
<p>The Republican governor&rsquo;s appearance was organized in the days after he made the remark Friday, responding to a reporter&rsquo;s question about criticism he had received over his decision not to attend the state NAACP&rsquo;s annual King Day celebrations. He said at the time that he didn&rsquo;t attend events for special interests, and his spokesman cited scheduling conflicts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell them to kiss my butt,&#8221; LePage said.</p>
<p>The comment drew harsh criticism from state and national leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Maine NAACP Director Rachel Talbot Ross said her organization is no special interest, and the group&rsquo;s national president and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous said LePage&rsquo;s comments &#8220;inflame racial tension.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Monday&rsquo;s appearance was hastily added to his schedule, LePage had previously attended several Martin Luther King breakfasts in Waterville while serving as mayor before he was elected governor, a spokesman said. Monday&rsquo;s event was sponsored by the local Rotary club and a senior citizens&rsquo; group.</p>
<p>{snip} In an interview, he declined to discuss his earlier comments, but acknowledged that the holiday &#8220;represents an awful lot, particularly to black America. I mean, Martin Luther King was a peaceful activist and unfortunately he gave his life for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement issued later by his office, he said, &#8220;Dr. King is someone who spent and ultimately gave his life making sure that people got a fair shake regardless of race. We have come far through the years, but the journey continues to make Dr. King&rsquo;s dreams a reality. I urge all Mainers to work as one for a better life for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others attending Monday&rsquo;s event weren&rsquo;t so forgiving.</p>
<p>LePage&rsquo;s attendance was &#8220;a political act that has nothing to do with his convictions,&#8221; said Julie de Sherbinin, a language professor at Colby College in Waterville. De Sherbinin, who is white, is involved in a campus organization that promotes improved race relations.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Sean Alfano, Daily News (New York), January 14, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Republican governor of Maine has refused to break bread with the NAACP for Martin Luther King Day celebrations, instead telling the civil rights group to kiss his butt.</p>
<p>Gov. Paul LePage says he has personal commitments that will keep him from attending a dinner Sunday night and a breakfast on Monday that honor King.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to be held hostage by special interests,&#8221; LePage told WCSH-TV.</p>
<p>When asked about charges from NAACP leaders that he has ducked several requests to attend their events over the past few months, LePage offered the group a suggestion: &#8220;Tell them to kiss my butt.&#8221;</p>
<p>LePage, who is white, further defended his planned absence, saying his adopted son is black.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they want to play the race card, come to dinner and my son will talk to them,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>The usual revolting story: White man stands on his hind legs for a few days, then knuckles under and crawls to his black masters.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;LePage, who is white, further defended his planned absence, saying his adopted son is black.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Second thought, it appears that LePage was infected with the Self-Hating-White virus all along.  And in Maine, of all places!  I hope the Mainers who voted for him enjoy the spectacle of him groveling on his hands and knees in their name.</p>
<p>What a good laugh blacks must have over such disgusting cravenness.<br>

		<p>This is an utterly disappointing and demoralizing development. It proves without a doubt to anyone not already convinced that the NAACP and all of their allies have created an incredibly effective climate of fear. My guess is that the Governor was fearful for far more than his political life; what else could explain the radical, self-effacing change? Another loss for the truth. Another loss for personal freedom. Another loss for personal integrity. Another loss for Whites. Another loss for America.</p>

		<p><i> the group&rsquo;s national president and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous said LePage&rsquo;s comments &ldquo;inflame racial tension.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how selective they are in their concern about &ldquo;inflaming racial tension.&#8221; They couldn&rsquo;t care less when blacks and liberals &ldquo;inflamed racial tension&#8221; by laying all the problems of the black race at the feet of whites. Where were the NAACP&rsquo;s concerns about &ldquo;inflaming racial tension&#8221; when television news outlets nationwide ran the Rodney King &#8220;beating&#8221; endlessly, inspiring the L.A. riots? More recently, where were their concerns when the act of a lone, crazed gunman in Arizona was blamed on Sarah Palin and the Tea Party? The NAACP is mighty selective when it comes to concern about &ldquo;inflaming racial tension.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh yes, I&rsquo;m sure old Julie knows all about &#8220;race relations&#8221; living in Waterville Maine! As I&rsquo;ve said before, if White people like this Julie are so interested in race relations, why don&rsquo;t they move to and teach in Detroit or E. St. Louis? Why doesn&rsquo;t anybody ever challenge these idiots!!<br>
I think there should be a requirement that any White people wanting to start\join an organization that promotes race relations has to live among them in the hood for at least a year first, ya know - get to know their subjuct &#8216;mo bedda&rsquo;.   </p>

		<p>The guy lives in a state in which the entire Black population will probably fit on a single page in the phone book and he is afraid of the NAACP. The NAACP isn&rsquo;t even ran by Blacks, so why did he go from telling people to his his butt to kissing butt. Who is he REALLY afraid of?</p>

		<p>10:  That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t get either. The whites that are scared of offending them  &mdash;  be they celebrities or politicians  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t get a majority of their support from blacks or hispanics for that matter.  Again, this &#8216;racist&rsquo; word has made many whites for too long do such pathetic, butt-kissing things.  Any white that apologizes for getting accused of racism doesn&rsquo;t get my respect.  If you show radical blacks and the Left you aren&rsquo;t afraid of them and stand your ground, they will back down!</p>

<p>Wow, Julie sure chose an interesting state to live in and promote better race relations.  Maine is per capita the whitest state in the Union, just head of New Hamshire, Wyoming and Vermont.  Strange how so many white &#8220;experts&#8221; on race relations tend to live in these areas of the country, no?</p>

<p>Well, that depends on what one means by &#8220;race relations&#8221;. If whites want to start an organization that promotes the right of whites to freely associate with our own kind, I think it&rsquo;s enough merely to know that blacks are far more likely to commit crimes than the reverse, and to know that they ruin any locality or state that they run. If, on the other hand, a white wishes to force other whites to associate with blacks, he should definitely have to spend a year &#8220;in the &#8216;hood&#8221;.</p>

		<p>LaPage thought he could be considered immune to the black backlash due to his &#8220;see, I&rsquo;m not a racist because I adopted a black child,&#8221; free pass. Maybe now he sees that there IS no immunity to the black backlash. It is a day in/day out groveling effort, never to be paid in full.</p>
<p>The nonsensical thinking of any white who adopts black children pretty much writes them off in my book. </p>

I can make some guesses. I think a call from the White House could work miracles. (Surely the gov. needs some help with his highway budget or something?)  Not necessarily from Numero One, either,  but just from any staffer would do the trick. </p>
<p>But if I get your meaning, it doesn&rsquo;t have to come from inside the WH at all. There are lots of unofficial People With Clout. And with money!  People who pull the strings and get things done. People who don&rsquo;t take &#8220;no&#8221; for an answer. People you don&rsquo;t mess with.  Diversity is their pet  project and they&rsquo;re not going to have any mere governor get too cocky. </p>

<p>Well, the guy&rsquo;s got guts to say something like that.  What I don&rsquo;t like is how he apologized and attended the NAACP event.  I would simply say &#8220;Kiss my butt!&#8221; louder and walk away if they insisted I come to their stupid little dinner.  But then, maybe that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not a governor.  No-one can be both principled, AND a good politician.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that anyone would think that a guy like this with an adopted Jamaican kid would be on our side.  C&rsquo;mon, do you think he&rsquo;s some kind of humanitarian?  I don&rsquo;t believe in interracial adoption but why not adopt one of the many, many, many black kids available in this country instead of importing one? Is his real goal to increase the minority population in the country? </p>

		<p>Why indeed would he adopt a Jamaican kid? When our four left the next and embarked on very successful careers and marriages after college, we toyed with the idea of taking in foster kids. If they worked out   &mdash;   adopting them. I mean we had a fine 5-bedroom suburban home. A boat, RV trailer, other goodies. We could easily fit in two to four foster kids, nor would we have needed or wanted state aid.</p>
<p>So we went to several adoption agencies including a Catholic one. Surprise, surprise, surprise. All the good nuns had to offer were mixed-race kids, many in their early teens. Probably born to drug addict or alcohol-addicted White mothers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we told the good nuns in effect: &#8220;Thanks, but no thanks.&#8221; Instead we hit the local animal shelter and adopted several cats and a couple more dogs. At least our now eight pets return the love we lavish on them unstintingly and fit in quite well. The nuns? Well, to say they were scandalized would be an understatement. </p>
