<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70E1YW20110115">Tribal Ruling Raises Dispute Over Slaves Owned by Indians</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Fenwick, Reuters, January 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A tribal court ruling that the Cherokee Nation must allow descendants of former slaves owned by Indians to be tribal members, has again raised the painful history of the forcible removal of the Indians to Oklahoma in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>A Cherokee Nation tribal court ruled on Friday that the nation cannot exclude the so-called &#8220;Freedmen&#8221; from tribal membership even though some of them are not blood descendants of the Indians.</p>
<p>The issue arises because when the U.S. government forced Indian tribes to walk from the Southeast U.S. to Oklahoma in 1831, in what the Indians described as the &#8220;Trail of Tears&#8221;, some of them brought their African-American slaves with them.</p>
<p>They brought them because the Cherokee owned plantations in the U.S. South. When the tribe was ejected from the land they were allowed to take their possessions with them, including the slaves.</p>
<p>After the Civil War, those slaves were freed and an 1866 treaty with the U.S. required the Cherokee to admit to the tribe the slaves and their descendants, some with Cherokee blood because plantation owners had fathered children with slave women, and some with no Indian blood.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Cherokee tribe voted for a tribal constitutional amendment that revoked the membership of the slave descendants who could not prove Cherokee blood. This stripped more than 2,800 Freedmen descendants of tribal membership, most of them African-Americans. Friday&rsquo;s ruling invalidates the Amendment.</p>
<p>The case is being heard separately in a U.S. Federal court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vann [Marilyn Vann, a member of the Cherokee Freedmen and president of the organization that represents descendants of the former slaves] said some in the Cherokee tribe did not want to allow the descendants of slaves to vote on issues such as distributing the millions of dollars of tribal income from gambling casinos.</p>

<p>The painful history of the Trail of Tears was not the awful history I thought that would raise. I kind of figured the painful history raised was Indian ownership of black slaves. I guess things haven&rsquo;t really advanced so far after all. &#8216;White man heep bad&rsquo;, is the only lesson here - and that&rsquo;s from the Western media. </p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s so important we learn the awful history of slavery, and it&rsquo;s so important we learn about the suffering the red man, why isn&rsquo;t it important we learn Indians owned black slaves?</p>

		<p>Right, membership in a tribe is usually determined by a blood relationship, not a familiar relationship. Lots of benefits for a person who can gain tribal membership. INCLUDING of course part of the profit from gambling establishments.</p>

		<p>Are the Indians insane?!!!  It&rsquo;s obvious that all the blacks want is the money, why in the world are Indians bowing to racial pressure like this only to be robbed?  Blacks are NOT Indians and don&rsquo;t deserve to be a member of any Tribe.  What is it with blacks claiming to be other than black?  Enough already.</p>

		<p>Uh oh. The article did something naughty.</p>
<p>It recognized that the Indians owned slaves.</p>
<p>But weren&rsquo;t these just peaceful little darlings who were all &#8216;massacred out of existence&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>What such a ruling means is that it is now possible for the distant future Cherokee nation to be seen less as Native American and more as African. If anything, give the African-American-Cherokee group their own designation and leave the Cherokee as pure-blooded as possible.  It&rsquo;s the only way to ensure as best as possible the true ethnicity of the tribe into the future.  Anything less should be seen as a further denigration of the Cherokee.</p>

		<p>This kind of multiculturalism is good, because it keeps them all confused and disunited in distrust.  Hey, if they believe in it, then they had better get used to living integration in full.  After all, race is only a social construct.  Right?</p>

		<p>Questions for the knowledgeable or research-inclined:</p>
<p>1. Where can I acquire a copy of the book, &#8220;Cherokee Guilt&#8221;?</p>
<p>2. I&rsquo;ve met whites who brag about having Cherokee ancestors. Do blacks brag about having ancestors who were owned by Cherokees?</p>
<p>3. Will debates between Black Studies departments and Native American Studies departments over the present issue be televised?</p>
<p>4. Is the Cherokee ownership of black slaves mentioned in the major books about &#8220;The Trail of Tears&#8221;? (I&rsquo;m guessing those slaves cried even more than their owners did).</p>
<p>5. Were the Cherokee one of the tribes who took slaves before the white man came, or were they introduced to the practice by the horrible white man? (This question suggests a much more interesting general question: <i>Were the tribes who held slaves from other tribes allowed to keep those slaves (if the tribes were located in the South, I guess) after they were brought under the control of whites?</i>)<br>

		<p>Many tribes had slaves, not just the Cherokees.  And they were not always Black.  In fact the practice of slavery predated the arrival of Europeans to North America.  Slaves were taken from enemy tribes and when Whites arrived Whites were taken as slaves too.  Those taken were almost always women and children.  Men would simply be killed.</p>

		<p>You know whats even more horrible that people don&rsquo;t want to hear in this country?  When Lincoln emancipated the slaves - many Native American tribes didn&rsquo;t lose their right to own slaves - so they continued to do so for longer than white Southerners were &#8220;legally&#8221; allowed to.  Oh yeah, and another thing people in this country don&rsquo;t like to hear is that when Lincoln emancipated the slaves he didn&rsquo;t free a single slave held in Northern territories - guess for this New Englander, Lincoln&rsquo;s idealism was a bit over blown, hmmm?</p>

<p>Primitive tribal people boundaries were defined by us and the other, much of which was general forest creatures of the time, including other huminoid types of beings. </p>
<p>Routinely all tribes with power  &mdash;  numbers and weapons  &mdash;   would prey on other tribes, capturing for sell or enslavement or food.</p>
<p>Early contact writings document this normalcy  &mdash;  enslaving was a cultural trait of american indan tribes. That the Cherokees had</p>
<p>their slaves with them on the Trail of Tears is just desserts</p>
<p>for the victicrat ameriophobes. </p>

		<p>As for keeping the Cherokee tribe &#8220;pure&#8221;   &mdash;   even in the 19th century a full-blooded Cherokee was hard to find.  Nowadays one can be enrolled in any tribe with only 1/32% of Indian blood.</p>

		<p>Okay, follow my reasoning on this.<br>
If African Americans who were slaves of the Cherokee can be considered Native American, then by extension, would not African Americans owned by Whites be White? And furthermore, since African Americans also owned slaves, descendents of those slaves are the only true African Americans in the country along with recent post slave immigrants. <br>
And since they want reparations, who is left to pay for them, since we&rsquo;ve just now established what a confounded mess this all has become?<br>
The only logical conclusion I can come up with is eliminating affirmative action and racial set asides because one group of &#8220;whites&#8221; can&rsquo;t be discriminated arbitrarily against any other groups of whites.</p>

		<p>  No. 17, what law or rule says a person can be enrolled in any tribe with only 1/32% of Indian blood? The Slavic people are still called and named with the word slave, are they not? Can they get reparations from anybody or not? Anybody ever hear of the slavic plain? Were the Slavic people named slavs first and the name slaves derived from the peoples tribe or the other way around? Don,t know for sure guess i will have to go to the library or look it up on the internet, unless somebody out there knows something. Does that mean a whole group of people are known by the word slave (Slavs)? What about DNA? On one T.V. showed it reported that a whole lot of people are surprised when they checked out their own DNA.</p>

		<p>Very good idea for all people to check their DNA. </p>
<p>Clearly there are Clades, clans, lineages, tribes, varieties in the hominoid primates, and where yours came from is easy to determine with DNA analysis. </p>
<p>Check the national geographic website for the genomic project, about 125. for the kit for each sex chromosome. </p>
<p>Do both X and Y and be intrigued about where you ancestors 25 generations ago came from and where they travel.</p>

		<p>I got the 1/32 a few years ago from a fellow who was enrolled in a small No. Calif. tribe.  Checking on web I found sites saying that each tribe can determine its own membership and the percentage of Indian blood required can range from 5/8 to zero.  You can search &#8220;blood quantum&#8221; for more information, but much of this will be by Indians seeking to promote their own political and financial objectives.</p>
