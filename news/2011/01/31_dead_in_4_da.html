<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41008845/ns/world_news-americas/">31 Dead in 4 Days in Mexico&rsquo;s Acapulco</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, January 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The body of a murdered man was found Monday on the main highway to Acapulco, bringing to 31 the number of people killed in the Pacific resort city over four days. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the killings occurred in just a few hours from Friday night to Saturday in non-tourist areas of the city. But the officers were shot to death in front of tourists on Avenida Costero Miguel Aleman, the hotel-lined thoroughfare that runs along the bay.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Messages left with the 14 decapitated men said they were killed by &#8220;El Chapo&rsquo;s People,&#8221; a reference to the Sinaloa cartel headed by Joaquin &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Guzman. Leyva would not say whether the notes indicated Sinaloa had joined the fight.</p>
<p>The decapitations were the largest single group found in Mexico in recent years. In 2008, a group of 12 decapitated bodies were piled outside the Yucatan state capital of Merida. The same year, nine headless men were discovered in Guerrero&rsquo;s capital, Chilpancingo.</p>

		<p>One day we&rsquo;re going to wake up and see the headlines screaming of a major takeover in Mexico by the drug cartels.  </p>
<p>The situation, I believe, is far worse than either the US or the Mexican government will admit.</p>
<p>It amounts to a war comparable to Iraq or Afghanistan right on our southern border without the missile attacks, land mines, IED&rsquo;s and aerial bombings, but a war all the same, which appears to be more vicious than Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

		<p>Interesting, leftists always blame the USA for these international problems, and in this case, it&rsquo;s true. 30,000 Mexicans killed in a drug war fought over sending illegal drugs into North America. Obama hasn&rsquo;t said a single word about it. Yes, we can save the planet but I guess having to forego a weekend doobie would to much to ask. Some sacrifices are too big!</p>

		<p>The easiest way to justify the NAU is to allow Mexican Drugs, Islamic Terrorism and a nuke or other act of mass-terrorism to come together, north of the border.  No more worries about border security if the US Army is sitting in Mexico City.</p>
<p>I wonder if this is indeed being done by Mexican drug gangs (there are about 9, with numerous subdivisions, by last count) and if so whether they realize their actions are as much an agenda in and of themselves as an overt act of rebellion against a failed state?</p>

<p>Money may buy strange allies but it also makes people STUPID as to the greater processes in play.</p>
<p>And a lot of this sounds like the type of stuff that blackops operators would undertake to destabilize a situation by creating anonymous guilt.</p>

		<p>Mexican civil society is disintegrating. The drug cartels are taking over. It is like Al Capone&rsquo;s Chicago in the 1920&rsquo;s. End the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; America or face having a failed state, narco-country on your long, porous and vulnerable border.</p>

		<p>This savagery is an every day occurrence in Mexico, and is of course, an unspoken reason why states such as Arizona are trying to limit their Mexican influx - people are genuinely alarmed and frightened of the future in what will be a heavily Mexican state.<br>
     Saying all that compare and contrast the media frenzy concerning the attempted murder of one minor US politician to the wholesale massacres and mutilations that occur on a daily basis in Mexic with nary a squeak from the MSM.</p>

		<p>  And due to open borders, expect this wonder of diversity to be coming to a city near you right here in the U.S. We truly must not speak out, it would not be politically correct. We must continue to lose everything to minorities so as not to be considered racist. I truly don&rsquo;t get it. If you&rsquo;re white and proud, you&rsquo;re racist. Even Fox news has turned out to be as bad as CNN and MSNBC. Forget the facts, just give us some sensational propaganda. I think Michael Savage was right about the major news outlets. All lipstick and legs. It is all about ratings, nothing more. Mexico is in a civil war, it will spread to the U.S. Thousands are pouring across our borders, and not just to find a better life. Out own federal govt. has made some areas off-limits to our own citizens due to mexican drug trafikers.</p>

		<p>First time here, Thanks</p>
<p>Regarding this subject- once in a while I think to myself that right now, this very minute, there is some person in Mexico sitting at a table or driving a car or sleeping and tomorrow his body will not have a head on it. Does he think to himself while eating dinner &#8220;Este es un burrito genial, me pregunto si voy a perder mi futuro en la cabeza?&#8221; Now I know there are those who are victims of collateral damage, and that&rsquo;s unfortunate, but the majority who get sliced and diced must be living on the dark side. What kind of profile of such a person exists? Are they victims of circumstances or are they just plain imbeciles or am I just out of touch with reality?</p>

		<p>Does this mean that the myth that these drug murders are being kept out of the resort towns is officially over?</p>
<p>I think Harumphty Dumpty has underestimated the likely speed of the thread.  At rate things are going downhill, by 2051, these incidents won&rsquo;t just be common in Los Angeles; they&rsquo;ll be common in our own resort towns, like Tahoe, Vail and Aspen.</p>
