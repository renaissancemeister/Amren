			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Johnson, Floyd Reports, January 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New Congressional leaders have begun their investigations into the most potent scandal facing the Obama administration, one that seems destined to expose injustice at the highest levels of government. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-TX, the new chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has opened a probe into the Justice Department&rsquo;s handling of the Black Panther case in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder. Smith is looking into whether the case&rsquo;s dismissal, and the underlying culture of the department&rsquo;s Voting Rights division, show a decision to deny justice to a broad category of Americans based on race. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Smith singled out the another reported refusal by Fernandes [Julie Fernandes, Obama&rsquo;s Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights] in his letter: an alleged determination not to enforce a provision of the National Voter Registration Act (known as the &#8220;Motor Voter Law&#8221;) requiring localities to purge the voting rolls of dead and ineligible voters. Smith asked if Fernandes opted to &#8220;explicitly or implicitly direct Voting Section staff not to enforce any section of any federal rights statute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fernandes seems to have admitted as much in public. Discussing that specific section, she publicly stated, &#8220;We have no interest in enforcing this provision of the law. It has nothing to do with increasing turnout, and we are just not going to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Congress similarly has the duty to determine where this policy originated, and whether officials who publicly deny its existence are guilty of perjury or obstruction of justice. Thomas Perez, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, testified on May 14 that the decision to drop the case was simply &#8220;a case of career people disagreeing with career people,&#8221; and that no &#8220;political leadership involved in the decision not to pursue this particular case.&#8221; However, the watchdog group Judicial Watch has uncovered proof of significant political involvement in lobbying on behalf of the Panthers. Did Perez commit perjury? If so, how high did the political pressure go? Who handed down the decision to dispense race-based &#8220;justice&#8221;? How high does the cover-up of this decision reach? Namely, did the attorney general or the president of the United States himself suborn perjury?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering why Morris Dees and the SPLC are so quiet regarding this issue. Certainly there is no more flagrant hate group than the Black Panthers.</p>

		<p>When black racist A.G. Eric Holder first took office, he made the usual &#8220;we have to have honest conversations about race&#8221; remarks. He&rsquo;d meant, of course, that even after both he and Obama had gotten their affirmative action positions, blacks still weren&rsquo;t getting enough special privileges. </p>
<p>Well, it looks like he might be getting a really real  conversation now. :)</p>
<p><br>
A correction to this story: the group involved is the New Black Panthers. Even the original Black Panthers have labeled the new group as &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Holder is about: WHITE GENOCIDE</p>
<p>Genocide isn&rsquo;t always about knives and guns  &mdash;   read the UN definition.</p>
<p>Holder is about making all White countries on Earth, including USA, places where Whites are a powerless, persecuted, and dwindling minority beset on all sides.</p>
<p>Africa for Africans, Asia for Asians, White countries for EVERYBODY! Do you see a pattern?</p>
<p>WHITE GENOCIDE</p>

		<p>please do not confuse these groups,this case is about the &#8220;New black panthers&#8221; not the &#8220;Black Panthers&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Who cares whether this group is the New Black Panther Party or the one that from the 60s?  Like other black-oriented groups, both of them are anti-white, anti-American, and have the same end goal in mind: they wish to displace whites (kill us, too, if possible) and divide all the goodies to blacks (and other non-whites).   What is the real difference?  There isn&rsquo;t!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard these stories perhaps too often to straightaway think this might be something of a breakthrough, but maybe we can allow ourselves a bit of hope here.</p>

		<p>The old black panthers were no bargain, they were plain and simple racists and hated blacks (&#8220;Uncle Toms&#8221;), who wouldn&rsquo;t join their violent hate based movements.</p>
<p>Our nation has gone backwards in trying to be diverse for the undeserving and unqualified.  </p>
