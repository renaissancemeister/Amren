			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dana Kennedy, AOL News, January 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This country&rsquo;s most notorious political party, the far-right National Front, will soon have a new boss for the first time since it was founded nearly 40 years ago by Jean-Marie Le Pen, known for his anti-Semitic views.</p>
<p>Some say the charismatic, blond, twice-divorced mother of three expected to succeed him may modernize the party  &mdash;  but is not unlike the old boss.</p>
<p>After all, she&rsquo;s his daughter. Her own mother has even called her his &#8220;clone.&#8221; Marine Le Pen, 42, is expected to be elected head of the National Front at a party convention this weekend.</p>
<p>Given the growing anti-immigration sentiment and prejudice against Muslims on the rise in Europe, the fear among some is that Marine Le Pen may become the softer, prettier face of xenophobia and racism in France and make her party more palatable.</p>
<p>While she has disavowed her father&rsquo;s anti-Semitism, Le Pen shares his belief that France should halt immigration, and that citizenship by birth should not be automatic.</p>
<p>Her highly rated appearance last month on the French political program &#8220;A Vous de Juger&#8221; (You Be the Judge), prompted a writer for Les Echos to call her one of the biggest media and political &#8220;phenomena of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s dangerous because she represents modern archconservatism and anti-immigration, but she seems so much less bigoted and racist than her father because she&rsquo;s of a different generation and she&rsquo;s a woman,&#8221; Jean-Yves Camus, a political analyst at the Institute of International Relations and Strategy in Paris, told AOL News.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although she began her career as a lawyer, Le Pen decided to embrace the family business in 1998 when she joined the National Front. French political experts believe she hopes to someday achieve a real legitimacy among France&rsquo;s right-wing bloc, something her father never achieved.</p>
<p>Early signs bode well for her. The results of a poll released this week in Le Monde found that 22 percent of respondents support &#8220;the ideas&#8221; of the National Front, up from 18 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Marine Le Pen, through her remarks about Muslims, has reminded us that she is the carrier of a profoundly discriminatory position and, in my opinion, anti-republican,&#8221; said Pierre Moscovici, a member of the French Socialist Party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Le Pen] and his daughter are optimistic that Marine will inject new blood in the National Front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some said, &#8216;Here&rsquo;s a woman, who is young, who contrasts with the caricatured image that some people might have of the National Front  &mdash;  a macho party, a rather tough party, with members who didn&rsquo;t necessarily come out of the younger generations,&rsquo;&#8221; Marine Le Pen said.</p>
<p>Wallerand de Saint-Just, the vice president of the National Front and the former longtime lawyer of Jean-Marie Le Pen, said France should not underestimate Marine.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s new and she&rsquo;s modern,&#8221; Saint-Just told AOL News. &#8220;Marine is the future of France.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;Softer Face of Racism in France&#8221;  Mr. Kennedy smears this woman as a racist without defining what it is or how she meets the definition.  We are simply to assume that White people who are interested in advancing their own interests as Whites are, by definition, racist.</p>
<p>According to Merriam-Webster online dictionary racism is:</p>
<p>1: a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race</p>
<p>2: racial prejudice or discrimination </p>
<p>No. 1 requires that one believe in the &#8220;superiority of a particular race.&#8221;  </p>
<p>No. 2 could be applied to any number of public and private programs that give non-Whites the benefit of lower standards, or which are set asides or quotas in hiring or contracting or school admission.  (Liberals don&rsquo;t like to hear this about their pet programs to uplift the down trodden.)</p>
<p>To liberals (they now call themselves &#8220;progressives&#8221;) if a smear&rsquo;s effective, use it.  They don&rsquo;t bother with what words actually mean if they can be used to stifle debate and make White people cower.  Fortunately, decades of use of the &#8220;r&#8221; word have caused liberals&rsquo; powers to argue logically on race to atrophy.  When asked &#8220;What IS racism?&#8221; most can&rsquo;t give a concise definition and when the point is pressed it&rsquo;s they who are on the defensive.      </p>

<p>The National Front is France&rsquo;s most notorious party?  Don&rsquo;t they have a large and active Communist Party?  I for one would think most people would find communists scarier than &#8220;archconservatives.&#8221;</p>

<p>We can only hope. Of course the writer of this article had to resort to bomb-throwing by using loaded words like &#8220;xenophobia&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221; when dicussing Ms Le Pen and her party. That&rsquo;s because name calling is the only way left-wingers think they can win the argument over immigration. Silencing their opponents is so much easier than having a fact based discussion on immigration because they know that would ultimately undercut and destroy their case. And if Marine Le Pen were to win the presidency, it would be a watershed moment not just for France but for the rest of Europe and quite possibly the entire Western world as well. She doesn&rsquo;t carry the &#8216;baggage&rsquo; of her father which will undoubtedly broaden her appeal. </p>

		<p>A typical biased media piece,  slanted as can be!  Is there any other kind?  And this one even pretends to be neutral!</p>
<p>In just the first sentence, we are hit with  &#8220;notorious&#8221;, &#8220;far-right&#8221;, and &#8220;anti-Semitic&#8221;.  And even before that, the title speaks of &#8220;racism&#8221;. This already alerts to us what to expect to hear, and what we are supposed to think. </p>
<p>I have been following Le Pen (the father) for quite some time, and I am unaware of any specific &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221; on his part. Just what has he done or said?  True, he did make an unguarded remark to the effect that the Holocaust was a &#8220;detail&#8221; of history.  (Well, wasn&rsquo;t it? Or is it the center of history?) &hellip; And for that &#8220;crime&#8221; he  was prosecuted and fined heavily. They lost their headquarters building.  I can&rsquo;t think of anything else. Indeed, after that chastening experience, he has clammed up and made it clear, whenever asked,  that &#8220;we don&rsquo;t discuss those things&#8221;, and he doesn&rsquo;t. He has avoided  that entire poisonous topic. So where&rsquo;s the &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221;? </p>
<p>Well, in Europe, any group that is pro-nationalist is automatically presumed to be anti-Semitic. That&rsquo;s sufficient.  They are declared guilty before the trial, so to speak. His mere silence on the matter is presumed to be anti-Semitic, so now his daughter is going to have to become more pro-Semitic in order to have political success.</p>
<p>Anyone is welcome to join the National Front. The party&rsquo;s political views are not even &#8220;racist&#8221;, by common  American standards, so they would not be fully satisfying to many Americans  who would like a stronger stance on the subject.  Now, it appears that stance is  going to be softened and modified even more.  Will the National Front, as the price of success,  be reduced to just a slightly right-wing extension of the regular Establishment parties?  </p>
<p>Well, that is the reality of being allowed to exist as a political party in today&rsquo;s France (indeed, in today&rsquo;s Europe). It&rsquo;s all they are allowed. Anything stronger would get them banned and  a prison term under charges of &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;xenophobia&#8221;. That is the political straight jacket that European whites are forced to live in. Self defense is virtually impossible, and any hint at the merest attempt is condemned as &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Has there ever been any race or nation in history that has committed suicide so eagerly?  All in the name of equality and altruism! Is this the behavior of sane people, or of a continent gone mad?  I mustn&rsquo;t exempt North America and Australia either. The  collective madness has afflicted all our people. But just our people.  Others must think we&rsquo;re insane.</p>

		<p>I hope the National Front can make itself more appealing to people but it must make sure that it is drawing voters to its ideas and not radically changing the political platform in order to seem more politically correct and &#8216;votable.&rsquo; Because such a compromise would be as bad as never getting beyond .07% of the vote (which is something FN doesn&rsquo;t worry about anyway, because they&rsquo;re almost never under 10%).</p>

		<p><b>&#8220;Marine Le Pen: Softer Face of Racism in France?&#8221;</b></p>
<p><br>
Softer face of &#8220;racism&#8221;?  What the heck are they talking about?<br>
The title of this article is in itself a slur and a misrepresentation.</p>
<p>Oficially, there are no &#8220;racist&#8221; parties in France. Anything such would  not be allowed. If the Front National truly were racist, it could not exist. It would be banned. </p>
<p>The Front National is not a racist party and never has been. Anyone can join. It is simply a pro-French, patriotic, nationalist party. But that alone is enough to enrage the Left.</p>
<p>If their concern with issues such as crime, social pathology, or immigration happens to overlap with issues of race, that is a coincidence. But they do not (and cannot) present it in that way.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Saint-Just&#8221;? Holy bleep. To French ears, that name is associated with the climax of Jacobin terror.</p>
<p>Jean-Marie was, in a way, the embodiment of his party &hellip; ex-paratrooper, bodybuilder, a little holocaust revisionist (that´s about as far as his &#8220;anti-semitism&#8221; went), a little Pétainist (which is somewhat worse in French political discourse - though unjustly so. Pétain was the best man the French brought forth in the 20th century. At least on two occasions - Verdun 1916 and the mutinies 1917 - he saved France from oblivion. When he reached his headquarters at Verdun in the middle of the night, first thing he did was phone all his division commanders: &#8220;Hallo? C´est moi, Général Pétain. I have taken command. Tell that to your people.&#8221; Then he dropped with severe pneumonia and spent six days between life and death - but that was enough to weather the crisis. He was a legend - they didn´t call him &#8220;le médécin de l´armée&#8221; for nothing - and de Gaulle was one of his most ardent admirers then. He took the office that earned him infamy - and that he had previously described as &#8220;fit only for defeated marshals&#8221; - only because no one else had the authority to do what had to be done.)<br>
- The Front National always had the best results in the most North African districts i.e. Marseilles, probably not only because of exposure but because of the pieds noirs.</p>
<p>- As for Marine, I predict she will go the way of Alessandra Mussolini - a cute novelty, but taken seriously neither by the mainstream nor by the party base.</p>

		<p>When Whites, worldwide, finally regain their dominance and absolute, unapologetic control and influence over their own nations - smear words like &#8216;racist&rsquo; and &#8216;xenophobe&rsquo; and the like must become illegal to use, and the grounds will be that use of them is a devious trick to cloak of the crime of Genocide of all European people.  </p>

		<p>Whenever They mention Marine Le Pen They always emphasize the &#8220;She is a Blonde&#8221;. It is a way to link Her with &#8220;the Nazis&#8221; and hence it discredits anything else She might have to say about the Cultural transformation of France. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting point. It&rsquo;s also a subtle way of hinting that she&rsquo;s an airhead, a lightweight who&rsquo;s not to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what does her hair have to do with ANYTHING?</p>
<p>Look who&rsquo;s doing the racial stereotyping here! The very ones who are always howling about it.<br>
