Because Police and Social Services Fear Being Branded Racist</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), January 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police and social services were today accused of fuelling a culture of silence which has allowed hundreds of young white girls to be exploited by Asian men for sex.</p>
<p>New figures suggest that an alarmingly high proportion of prosecutions for on-street grooming of girls aged between 11 and 16 have involved men of Pakistani heritage.</p>
<p>Experts claim the statistics represent a mere fraction of a &#8216;tidal wave&rsquo; of offending in counties across the Midlands and the north of England which has been going on for more than a decade.</p>
<p>A senior officer at West Mercia police has called for an end to the &#8216;damaging taboo&rsquo; connecting on-street grooming with race. </p>
<p>Chief Inspector Alan Edwards said: &#8216;These girls are being passed around and used as meat. </p>
<p>&#8216;To stop this type of crime you need to start everyone talking about it but everyone&rsquo;s been too scared to address the ethnicity factor.</p>
<p>&#8216;No one wants to stand up and say that Pakistani guys in some parts of the country are recruiting young white girls and passing them around their relatives for sex, but we need to stop being worried about the racial complication.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a briefing paper, researchers at University College London&rsquo;s Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science concurred that victims were typically white girls while &#8216;most central offenders are Pakistani&rsquo;. </p>
<p>The offenders were not viewed as paedophiles but had picked the girls &#8216;because of their malleability&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The report concluded that &#8216;race is a delicate issue&rsquo; that should be &#8216;handled sensitively but not brushed under the carpet&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The grooming usually begins with older groups of men befriending girls aged from 11 to 16 they meet on the street.</p>
<p>In a typical scenario, the victim is initially treated as a girlfriend and showered with presents and attention.</p>
<p>But the relationship quickly becomes more sinister as the abuser plies the child with drink and drugs before effectively pimping her out to friends and associates. </p>
<p>The worst cases involve young girls being moved around the country to be repeatedly abused. </p>
<p>Charities and agencies working in conjunction with the police to help victims of sexual abuse in such cases have publicly denied there is a link between ethnicity and the on-street grooming of young girls by gangs and pimps.</p>
<p>But in 17 court cases since 1997 where groups of men were prosecuted, 53 of the 56 people found guilty were Asian, 50 of them Muslim, while just three were white, according to The Times.</p>
<p>The claims come after five Asian men were jailed in November for a total of 32 years for a string of sexual offences against girls aged between 12 and 16 in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.</p>
<p>The presiding judge Peter Kelson QC, told the men they were &#8216;sexual predators&rsquo;, adding: &#8216;You had what you regarded as your fun. Now you will take your punishment.</p>
<p>&#8216;All five of you were  &mdash;  convicted of sexual activity with a child. The clue is in the title: a child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Weeks earlier, nine Asian men were jailed for the &#8216;sustained sexual abuse&rsquo; of a privately-educated schoolgirl who was forced into sex slavery aged 14 after being picked up by a gang in Rochdale, greater Manchester.</p>
<p>Mohammed Shafiq, director of the Lancashire-based Ramadhan Foundation, a charity working for peaceful harmony between different communities, said last year: &#8216;I think the police are overcautious because they are afraid of being branded racist.</p>
<p>&#8216;These men are criminals and should be treated as criminals  &mdash;  whatever their race.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Former Labour MP Ann Cryer provoked a fierce in 2003 when she said the traditional culture of arranged marriages could have caused a criminal minority of Asian men to target vulnerable young white girls for sex.</p>
<p>The cases of on-street grooming in the UK have borne comparison with incidents in the Netherlands involving young white girl being groomed for prostitution by Moroccan pimps, known as &#8216;loverboys&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A tri-nation study in Utrecht in 2005 and 2006 involving Barnardo&rsquo;s saw a Dutch women&rsquo;s group attack the &#8216;double moral standards&rsquo; of offenders who &#8216;guard the chastity of their sisters, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. use other girls for their loverboy practices&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A project in Blackburn has been established to confront the issue while a report by the Derby safeguarding children board in the wake of the arrests last year said there should be greater consideration of &#8216;whether the ethnic background and culture of the perpetrators had any bearing on their decision to take part in this activity&rsquo;.</p>

<b><big>The Asian Sex Gangs Who Preyed On Vulnerable Young Girls</big></b></p>
<p><b>November 1997: Leeds Taxi Drivers</b></p>
<p>Mohammed Naim Rashid, 21, was jailed for seven years and Abid Hussain Sadique, 21, for four by Leeds Crown Court in November 1997.</p>

<p>They targeted two 14-year-olds in the care of social services, plying them with drink an drugs before having sex with them in a BMW and a flat. </p>
<p>The victims were also offered to brothers, uncles and friends for sex.</p>
<p>Both were jailed for five years and eight months on charges including abduction, sexual activity with a child and supplying drugs.</p>
<p><b>October 2007 and January 2008: 33 Victims Aged 12 to 15 in Sheffield</b></p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s crown court heard how an inquiry was sparked when a number of girls went missing from home.</p>
<p>One 14-year-old was taken for a car ride before being raped. </p>

<p>Abid Siddique, 27, Mohammed Liaqat, 28, Mohamed Imran Rehman, 26, Faisal Mehmood, 24, Akshay Kumar, 38, Naweed Liaqat, 33, Farooq Ahmed, 29, Graham Blackham, 26 and Ziafat Yasin, 31, were jailed for their parts in the shocking case.</p>
<p>More than 100 police officers were involved in Operation Retriever, which identified 27 victims, 22 of whom were white.</p>
<p>Siddique and Liaqat targeted their victims on the streets of Derby while driving in a BMW. </p>
<p>They then exchanged number, invited them to parties and fed them drugs and alcohol before handing them to older men for sex.</p>
<p>The abuse, which took place in bushes, cars and houses was filmed for the men to share.<br>

		<p>These things are also happening in Canada and Australia, and probably in the U.S. as well. Police forces in all Western countries should consolidate their research and make public a comprehensive report on interracial predators.</p>
<p>As for their motives, the culture of North Africa and the near East is an unforgiving one.  Our liberties and freedoms stimulate them to aggression against us.</p>
<p>Finally, the conquest of white females is the consolation prize brown men seek for being second-class citizens in the West.</p>

Well he won&rsquo;t be a Puppy any more by the time he gets out. More of a mangy old mutt. </p>
<p>In dog years, that&rsquo;s a half-century. </p>
<p>But although I&rsquo;m glad this Puppy will be in the doghouse for a good long time, my vote would be to put the wretched beast to sleep. You know, with an injection. Nice and quick. </p>
<p>Then, it&rsquo;s off to the Pet Sematary with Puppy. </p>

		<p>When I was in jr high and high school most of the girls who were dating had boyfriends who were 18 to 28 years of age. Guys their own age weren&rsquo;t old enough to drive. Then us boys were the ones told we were sexist and taught to be more &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; because of all the wicked deeds of our ancestors. No doubt this white-men-as-the-cause-of-all-evil outlook is still part of the curriculum today. Perhaps it is in the UK too. </p>
<p>Some of the girls may have been simply putting forth an image of success or popularity or even trying to make us boys or even other girls jealous. Some of them (perhaps most of the girls telling these stories) were simply telling the truth. </p>

		<p>It is clear that poor young women are vulnerable to sexual exploitation and even moreso if they are white by non-whites.  We need to end the political correctness and warn these young women about what awaits them.  They have a better chance of long-term respectful relationships with someone of their own race.</p>

		<p>BNP boss Nick Griffin mentioned this phenomenom years ago in several speeches to BNP members.<br>
 There was only one result however, the British state (the propaganda wing ie the BBC and the judicial wing) conspired together to arrest Nick Griffin for speaking freely and attempted to send him to prison for a lengthy sentence.Yes, you read right - this is the state of things in the &#8216;home of liberty&rsquo; and the &#8216;mother of parliaments&rsquo;.<br>
  As an aside the Daily Mail newspaper never ceases to personally attack and denigrate Nick Griffin and the BNP.</p>

		<p>I have to wonder about these poor girls and what kind of family situations that they might have. More than likely they are not being taught about sexual preditors of the darker skinned sort and set themselves up for this problem. Part of the problem is that schools teach kids that race is merely a physical difference and other races get preferential treatment. 30-40 years ago girls who dated outside their race would have been called all sorts of names and possibly been shunned by their parents. I am not blaming the victim here but I am sure that parents are afraid to tell their daughters to NOT date men outside of their race. </p>
