			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nydia Han, WPVI-TV (Philadelphia), January 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A national statistic shows 90-percent of the dollars spent by African Americans go to businesses that are not African American owned or invested.</p>
<p>So a new program called Reverse 90 hopes to change that. The African American Chamber of Commerce designed it with the hope that discounts and deals would draw customers to the chamber&rsquo;s 400 member businesses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone can go to reverse90.com and take advantage of the deals offered by the businesses,&#8221; Nicole Giles of the African American Chamber of Commerce said.<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>The African American Chamber of Commerce set up Reverse 90 to encourage the support of African American owned and invested businesses.<br>

		<p>Absolutely! Do NOT buy anything from whitey. Do not rent his houses, or go to a white doctor, read any books written by whites, or use any white inventions. In fact, why dress like a white man or woman, go back to loincloth! No need to waste your money on white businesses when there are black-owned businesses that need your trade. Absolutely. Have nothing to do with white newspapers, or radial tires, or television, or anything white.</p>
<p>Yeah, watch what whitey does when you no longer go into his business or buy his food.</p>
<p>(I suspect whitey will be perfectly delighted.)</p>

		<p>Whites (and Asians and Hispanics) would be absolutely ecstatic if they did not have to encounter black loudness, rudeness, attitudes, screams of discrimination, crime, etc. in restaurants, stores and so on.  Please, buy black and don&rsquo;t come back.</p>

		<p>This seems exactly right to me. Blacks should spend money at Black-owned businesses and stay away from others. And Whites should visit reverse90.com so as to avoid spending their money in the wrong places. This is perfectly sensible.</p>

		<p>After you have gone to a mom &amp; pop fast food joint, the undertaker, barber shop/hair &amp; nail place, &amp; liquor store, how many more black businesses can you support? The white man designed your phones, cars, houses, and about 99% of everything you use. He probably even designed and engineered your &#8220;Sprewells&#8221; (Spinner Rims). </p>
<p>Back in the days of segregation, guess what, the blacks had their own businesses in a fair quantity. </p>
<p>The Black and Nobel book store (and p0rn shop) has a great tag line at the top of their homepage &#8220;WE SHIP TO PRISONS&#8221;. That should say it all. </p>

Everyone has to make a living.<br>
But it seems that blacks are put off by black owned companies because they lack the ability to sell.<br>
It is an area of black society that does not function nearly as well as the black music and entertainment industry.<br>
So what is it about black men that has brought them to this point of extinction where they cannot compete on a global scale?<br>
God says they have no honor.<br>

		<p>I am all in favor of blacks refusing to rent apartments from white landlords.  I don&rsquo;t care one way or another if they also refuse to buy food grown by white farmers but if they do then I&rsquo;m okay with that   &mdash;   let them starve.</p>
<p>Now if only blacks would also refuse to use food stamps paid for by white tax payers.  There&rsquo;s not much chance of that.</p>

		<p>Just how are blacks going to accumulate capital to even START a business? They spend all their money having a big time on Saturday night! </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example: In the 1950s, most everyone heated their homes with coal furnaces. When coal prices were their lowest about June, people would go to the coal company and order their winter coal. My grandfather told me he bumped into an old black man buying coal by the BAG at the coal company. He recommended that the old man buy coal by the ton. The old black man&rsquo;s response?</p>
<p>&#8220;No&hellip;I might die and someone else by keep warm with my coal!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think the reverse90 program is a splendid idea.I hope the reverse90 idea applies to neighborhoods or as African Americans like to say &#8220;the community&#8221;.Yes don&rsquo;t move to white areas of your city or town but keep your community exclusively black.</p>

		<p>The problem of non-consumerism among blacks for black enterprise is an ongoing one and very unlikely to change.  In the first place, there are few black businesses started and fewer that succeed.  Many blacks have bad credit, so they can&rsquo;t get loans to start businesses.  Then, most black enterprises are small scale, and they can&rsquo;t compete with lower prices charged by mega stores.  Historically, blacks often stocked inferior goods and had bad return policies.  Whether or not this is still true, black consumers may still harbor that perception  &mdash;  as well as the idea that anything white is of superior quality on the face of it.  Also, the notion of buying at black stores may make some blacks feel subject to segregation, and all that is needed to ruin a business is some specious rumor that it&rsquo;s really owned by white racists.  And, for the underclass, it&rsquo;s apparently deemed a lark to be able to go into whitey&rsquo;s stores and create nasty scenes.<br>
Blacks would do better to locate businesses in white liberal strongholds and hope fellow blacks stay away.</p>

		<p>What? Again with this black businesses for blacks? What happened to all the others as posted on AMREN? Gone bust I suppose. It&rsquo;s not true that one has to own a Mega-Store to compete. Any Mom &amp; Pop White store can get credit. Salesmen call by and restock shelves on a sale or return basis, everything from cosmetics to postcards. Owner just pays for what&rsquo;s sold. I doubt if there are many black travelling salesmen driving around restocking shelves in black stores. Think of all the whining.. &#8220;I can&rsquo;t pay you &#8216;cos I didn&rsquo;t sell anything, someone must have stolen all your stuff&#8221;.  Of course the black banks are only too willing to lend to all those black HBCU business graduates we hear so much about. If one of these stores opened in my area, I would be only too pleased to direct any of my potential black customers in their direction, in fact, I would insist on it! They couldn&rsquo;t possibly object on &#8216;rasiss&rsquo; grounds for refusing to patronise a black business!</p>

		<p>I know of a person who boycotts blacks on his own.  He refuses to deal with black salespersons.  He simply points to a white salesperson and says, &#8220;I was talking to him/her.&#8221; If he gets a black waiter/waitress, he leaves.  He is uncomfortable with using their services and not leaving a tip, which is the black way. </p>

		<p>The European-American Chamber of Commerce should propose that European-Americans buy only from businesses owned and operated by European-Americans. </p>
<p>Oh, wait a minute. If such an organization existed it&rsquo;d be deemed racist and the proposal would constitute hate speech and be subject to intervention by Eric Holder and the federal Department of Justice. </p>
<p>The racial hypocrisy is never-ending. </p>
