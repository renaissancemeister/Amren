		<p>Post an article about the Neanderthal B006 haplotype found recently at 10% in ALL Eurasians. Taken with the other 4%-8% they found last year, it&rsquo;s something to celebrate. Congrats on the conference and good luck JT. It&rsquo;s still too early but one day you&rsquo;ll be able to run for office as a real American hero, so I hope you live long &amp; healthy </p>

		<p>I hope that the weather gets better. I lived in the DC area<br>
back in the 1960&rsquo;s and remember one very cold and snowy<br>
winter, in which everything was closed for about a week.<br>
Where I am at now, the weather is very nice, similar to<br>
mild California weather.</p>

		<p>Is it just me or are we all tired of hearing Glenn Beck make his apologetics for Michael King? It has become unbearable to listen to this guy! Just today he was talking about the police officers killed over the last two days and then began to show the videos of the Ihop, Wendys, and bus altercations. He actually tried to finish it off with &#8220;well, we all are to blame!&#8221; As if this is not something to lay at the feet of blacks! What is up with this guy? I suggest that you stop listening to this dude - he is jaded by several things: 1. Protection of his job 2. Political correctness 3. He doesn&rsquo;t have a clue! Trust in your own judgement. Question yourself always. Act on those things that you know to be true. When in doubt - shout - to the most reliable source you know! And in the end - do something - even if it is wrong! </p>

After my many posts about AR utilizing video, I see you have advanced to the 21th century. Well done.</p>
<p>Now I want to see AR producing weekly video interviews. There are many good duel video chat programs. I want to see Mr. Taylor interviewing the guests of his choice on the topics of his choosing without the mainstream media filter. Have guest interviews like on c-span where a geneticist interviews a geneticist. I&rsquo;m sure there are many people who are looking for an outlet to share their ideas and research. Be that outlet.</p>
<p>Post them on this webpage. Post them on youtube and other media sites. Some may even go (relatively) viral.</p>
<p>Keep the momentum. <br>

		<p>Re #4 Dave: We are NOT &#8220;all to blame&#8221; as Mr. Beck put it. The blame for these incidents lie squarely on the shoulders of the perpetrators and the ones who raised (or rather DIDN&rsquo;T raise) them to act like civilized members of society. Much of the blame also attaches to the weak-willed, liberal, apologetic for &#8220;White Guilt&#8221; politicians and courts who let them reach their present chronological age (they aren&rsquo;t grown up) without a shred of decency and full of rage against the &#8220;racissss White privelege&#8221; we all supposedly enjoy.</p>

		<p> Al Sharpton was complaining that King had been hijacked by Whites in the Tea Party. Wish Beck would take his advice and stop invoking His Blessed Spirit- it is getting a bit out of hand. Let&rsquo;s stick with our cavalcade of heroes- there are plenty with actual character.</p>

		<p>I am in beautiful Cape Town South Africa, while the rest of SA is being flooded. ( PS - I have never seen snow except on overseas travels, but we are getting increasingly familiar with power outages under the absolutely useless, incompetent, criminal ANC government ).</p>
<p>Mandela is dominating the local MSM news.</p>
<p>Conservative Christian whites are polishing their guns, as we have been warned for years that &#8220;when Mandela dies you whites will die like flies&#8221;. The liberals and just about everyone else is caught up in the &#8220;Get well Madiba&#8221; - rut.</p>
<p>We have sympathy for you Americans with your Manchurian Candidate Presidency and weather problems, but spare a thought for us please. And keep an eye on happenings in our country.</p>
<p>Oh ! and congratulations with filling your quotas for the 2011 Amren Conference - and good luck. Our man Dr Dan Roodt will be there.</p>

		<p>#4  I am beginning to agree with you on Beck.  I particularly dislike the constant references to the bad ol South.  Truth be known, there was just as much if not more of the same reaction to blacks in the North.  Until the MLK law breakers came along there weren&rsquo;t so many problems between blacks and whites.  We got along just fine.  My grandmother told me of horrible riots in the North during the &rsquo;20s-30s.  And I was told of draft riots by blacks during WWII in the North.  No such difficulties in the South during that time.</p>

		<p>34  &#8220;He actually tried to finish it off with &ldquo;well, we all are to blame!&rdquo; As if this is not something to lay at the feet of blacks! What is up with this guy?

<p>Right after Beck declared on Fox and Friends that he thought Obama was a racist, the roar from the left was deafening.  Remember the article on here from the black woman from a black publication calling for a boycott?  Hers wasn&rsquo;t the loudest voice either.  The boycott, however, failed miserably.</p>
<p>SOME of the employees at Fox were even pressing Roger Ailes to force Beck to tone down the rhetoric, because they felt uncomfortable with it.  To his credit Ailes told them to stop criticizing other members of the show, but, behind the scenes, he made it known he wanted Beck to get out his message in a more indirect way.</p>
<p>By showing and mentioning the IHOP and other brawls and categorizing the incidents as a deterioration in the values and behavior of Americans in general, he&rsquo;s doing just that.  People are aware most all the perps are black and they can easily pick up on the message he&rsquo;s trying to impart. He uses other psychological ploys as well.  </p>
<p>While he isn&rsquo;t a racist, he DOES want to criticize bad black behavior, and the only way to do that without raising black ire and leftist complaints is to utilize a different format that is tied in with other subjects, which he does very cleverly.  </p>
<p>Beck is quite an intellect.  He doesn&rsquo;t have a formal advanced education but he&rsquo;s self-taught and much sharper than most of the pundits in the media.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the first MLK Day was in 1986, until they rehashed the Challenger disaster and had to put in that America had just had its first MLK day.  (Figures.)</p>

		<p>Couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the comments regarding Glenn Beck, so I felt compelled to add my two cents&rsquo; worth - to wit, Beck&rsquo;s more or less on my wave-length ideologically, but he&rsquo;s such an embarrassing and risible buffoon that I can&rsquo;t listen to him for more than five minutes.  And I find it disturbing that he has such a large audience, who clearly can tolerate and even apparently enjoy him.</p>
<p>Limbaugh&rsquo;s clearly much brighter, far more insightful and intelligent, and quite self-deprecating in a rather clever way.</p>
<p>Oh, well, to each his own.</p>

		<p>Very astute post from Ice.<br>
If Beck came out and said what everyone is thinking when he describes the IHOP brawl, etc. He would be off the air in seconds. By saying &#8220;We&#8221; are all to blame he can get his point across with out the grief. <br>
In thruth are we not all to blame for this behavior? Because of the invasive PC culture this behavior is tolerated and we all share some amount of blame for allowing Liberals to dictate to us what &#8220;our&#8221; morals are.</p>

		<p>Its frustrating to listen to the pandering the Becks and Limbaughs go through but remember, we all at one time were drawn in by something they said. There are many out there hearing these topics discussed for the first time and will likely whittle their views down to where many of us are at today.  Its the game the radio jockeys must play.  All radio hosts have an issue that place them at odds with their typical audience.  Dont fret about the 1%.  Its the day-in, day-out hammering we must embrace.  Think how many of Our voices are rising. </p>

		<p>I really admire the anti-czar work Beck has done, as well as the anti-Soros pieces that have done so much to link the President to &#8220;global justice,&#8221; redistributionism, and the anti-White intifada  &mdash;  -but I change the channel when Beck wants to give me a history lesson or religious instruction; I don&rsquo;t need or want either. <br>
   I don&rsquo;t believe Woodrow Wilson was the anti-Christ; as far as I can see he was a naive sucker at Versailles or an educated fool. Likewise, I don&rsquo;t believe the &#8220;progressive movement&#8221; started us down the path to a socialist hell; we got national parks, the pure food and drug act, and the smashing of monopoly capitalism out of the deal  &mdash;  -all good for me and mine.<br>
   And yes, I&rsquo;m on good terms with the cosmos. I don&rsquo;t need Beck&rsquo;s opinions on prayer, humility, right and wrong  &mdash;  -anything spiritual.    </p>

<p>You agree with Beck ideologically, but you&rsquo;re disturbed he has a large audience?  Huh?</p>
<p>Excuse me, but those contradictory statements seem rather odd.  Can you explain?</p>
<p>Yes, Limbaugh is very intelligent, but both men are superior intellects.</p>
