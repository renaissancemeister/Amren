			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Avni Patel, Brian Ross and John Solomon, ABC News and Center for Public Integrity, January 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The nation&rsquo;s fourth-largest housing authority spent lavishly on gifts for managers and a party with belly dancers, and its executive secretly spent more than $500,000 in housing authority funds to settle sexual harassment claims, but it allegedly ignored complaints of unsanitary conditions that nearly killed a 12-year-old resident.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, under the leadership of former executive director Carl Greene, the local housing authority spent $17,000 for a 2006 event, including $1,200 for a troupe of belly dancers. Photos of the event, obtained by ABC News, show Greene dancing with the exotically dressed women. A Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) spokeswoman said the event, which also included yodelers and karaoke, was a part of the housing authority&rsquo;s &#8220;diversity awareness&#8221; training.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Greene also used housing authority funds to buy gifts, including a $16,000 purchase from Nordstrom for $800 Tumi travel bags for himself and 19 of his top managers in 2009.</p>
<p>&#8220;For 12 years, 13 years he&rsquo;s had free reign at the housing authority, and I can&rsquo;t explain it,&#8221; said Michael Pileggi, a former housing authority attorney who now represents former PHA employees suing Greene and the housing authority. &#8220;It appears there was no fiscal oversight.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see if I understand the situation. Blacks sequester public money for private use. Other blacks sue the public for damages caused by these actions. An Indian-American investigative jounalist then reports the story. AmRen is again being blocked from discussing anti-liberal issues. My too-young-to-be-senile next door neighbor keeps telling me that &#8220;The good old USA is the greatest nation on earth&#8221;. I need a drink.</p>

		<p>Whites discovered long ago that most blacks cannot be trusted with both authority and money.  Ninety-five percent of the time they will spend frivolously, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s in private life or business.  In the past, there was always a white man at the top to oversee blacks&rsquo; actions.  Much of the inefficiency in the U.S. is due to the federal government&rsquo;s being in thrall to 12% of the population.</p>

		<p>Ah, yes, as a resident of Philadelphia&rsquo;s nearby &#8216;burbs, let me remind Amren readers of former mayor Street&rsquo;s comments:</p>
<p>In a 2002 address at a convention of the NAACP, Street said that &ldquo;the brothers and sisters are running the city. Oh, yes. The brothers and sisters are running this city. Running it! Don&rsquo;t you let nobody fool you, we are in charge of the City of Brotherly Love. We are in charge! We are in charge!&rdquo; This observation attracted some criticism and charges of racial divisiveness.</p>
<p>Let us enjoy the multi-culti madness, shall we? Imagine if a white person dared to say that even in a private conversation!!! We would be attacked, thrown out of our jobs! The above quote can be found on Wikipedia, under John F. Street. There are other controveries concerning the former mayor as well, which can be read about there, too.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, and seeing how rotten things are in Philadelphia, seeing what group is in charge, well, nobody should be surprised. There is a reason we call the city Kill-adelphia. I weep for that city, it was once the nation&rsquo;s capital. </p>

		<p>This is reminiscent of something that happened in St. Louis more than a decade ago.  The local chapter of BABAA (Blacks Assisting Blacks Against AIDS) hired a male stripper to &#8220;perform&#8221; for a group of black teenagers and young adults (both men and women) who were coming to an &#8220;AIDS awareness symposium.&#8221;  We found out later that the STL BABAA (not counting BABAA nationally or any other BABAA local chapters) was getting a little more than $1 million a year in Federal grants for this or that.</p>

		<p>This is also the story of that &#8220;Historically Black University&#8221;, Florida A&M; (FAMU).  Audits showed a plethora of cheating schemes, hundreds of millions of dollars missing, favoritism and an all black administration running wild with taxpayer dollars.  To top it off, the so-called university had a party house.  A mansion that was located 40 miles from its campus!  Through misadministration they finally lost the party house but not before they totally trashed the house thus lowering its sale value to almost zero.  BTW, Kwame Kilpatrick, the late mayor of Detroit, that doled out taxpayer money as if his own (including to his girlfriend- not wife), was educated at FAMU.  Graduates of this dipoloma mill spread out all across America and find themselves in charge, running massive programs with taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The temptation is too great for those that lack even a small sense of conscience.  As a country we will probably never recover from this blatant looting.</p>

		<p>Bishop State College in Mobile, Alabama, has also gone through a fair amount of corrupt management. It was rife with financial aid fraud and cooking the books to benefit their black run administration.</p>
