<h1><a href="https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/main/7390317.html">New Huffington Post Section Puts Focus on African-Americans</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jake Coyle, Houston Chronicle, January 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Huffington Post and BET co-founder Sheila Johnson are launching a HuffPost section devoted to African-Americans.</p>
<p>The section, &#8220;HuffPost GlobalBlack,&#8221; is expected to debut in early March. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to cover more stories of importance to the black community,&#8221; says Arianna Huffington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the supreme irony of having the first African-American president, which is such a historic event and a milestone, while at the same time, conditions for African-Americans are deteriorating, in terms of unemployment, in terms of high school graduation, in terms of the number of African-American males in prisons,&#8221; Huffington says.</p>
<p>GlobalBlack is the 27th section for the Huffington Post but its first racially based one. It plans to launch a Latino one soon.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t get this whole Huffington Post thing. Why would you start a website and name it after old-style, traditional, dying newspapers? And how arrogant would you have to be to name it after yourself anyway? And does the world really need yet another far-out, left-wing medial outlet? Most amazing of all, the site is hugely successful, with millions of visitors. I guess there&rsquo;s no risk in catering to the most left-wing common denominator. As far as  these black and Hispanic sections, it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me in the least. I expect them to be a huge success.</p>

<p>Wow! So you mean human nature hasn&rsquo;t changed, just because we elected a black president? And weren&rsquo;t we told all these things would improve with the election of Obama? We obviously need yet more blacks in every aspect of American politics. Yeah, that&rsquo;ll do the trick!</p>

Ahhh yes, the fractions begin to break off from the glorious united coalition.</p>
<p>These groups never stay together. They form to fight the alleged oppression of white Republicans but soon, each group wants THEIR issues address.</p>
<p>One bright spot I see on the multiCULTural horizon is that minorities can&rsquo;t unite as one. Their intrests and grievences are simply too diverse.</p>

<p>Media elites learn this cant in prestigious universities up East.  They would have us taxed, harried and belabored all &#8220;in terms of compassion&#8221; or &#8220;in terms of fairness.&#8221;  This is neither analysis nor formulation of policy, but merely an escape from predication, an elfin dance round the brutality of syntax.  This failure of language and heart, this Ivy League template is why reporters can now sit before a computer screen all day and never go out into the street to bring back some meat  &mdash;  and why that &#8220;Newsweek&#8221; in your hand will be less compelling than the next &#8220;Sand and Gravel.&#8221;</p>

		<p>HuffPo&rsquo;s black pages won&rsquo;t attract many black readers.  What it will attract are a bunch of SWPL-type white liberals who, from the comfort of their upper middle class or richer bedrooms, will log on and read HuffPo&rsquo;s black-oriented news and opinion so that they can pretend to be down with the social justice struggle.</p>

		<p>Good! Everything that serves as a form of defacto segregation - even simply in cyber-space - is a plus for our people. It just continues to point out that, by and large, black(or brown, etc.) interests are not OUR interests - and in this case, even the LEFT is fully aware, in their own ass-backward way, of this fact!  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised they didn&rsquo;t already have racially segregated sections.<br>
I see it as good. Non whites can have there places for whining and the rest of us can discuss things like grown ups.</p>

Indeed. What ever happened to the supposed &#8220;Obama effect&#8221; that would make black students rise up to unforeseen heights at the election of a black president?  Just another lie I guess.  Of course deranged leftists like Huffington just blame white racists for blacks failures anyway.  </p>
<p>My take on why Huffington decided to segregate her black readers into another area of the website is that blacks and white liberals don&rsquo;t really have too much in common.  Perhaps some of the white readers are unhappy with Obama and it makes the black readers upset at constantly having to defend the black messiah.  </p>

		<p>Though I am aware that a Euro-American section of the Huffington Post would likely require more than one or two token pages, I still finding it insulting that other races are placed on a pedestal while we, a global minority (and shrinking) don&rsquo;t even get a section in our own national papers.<br>
I&rsquo;m sure the majority of articles in these black and Hispanic sections will be about discrimination by the white man.<br>

<p>I take some small consolation from knowing that any media org betting that they&rsquo;ll be able to turn a profit on the number of blacks who will take the time to read political commentary OF ANY KIND, is doomed to disappointment. I can&rsquo;t see how a black section of the Huffing-on-something Post could possibly make money. Arriana must be aware that the tiny number of serious black readers will leave this new section of her website permanently in the red. So it&rsquo;s essentially a vanity project, designed mostly to flatter La Huff&rsquo;s public image as a righteous crusader against social injustice blah blah blah   &mdash;   rather than as an actual publication that can actually turn a profit because the public actually likes it. </p>

<p>Hey don&rsquo;t forget one for the Asians!</p>
<p>As a White Advocate I&rsquo;m in full support of this cyber-self-segregation!  When every single group BUT Whites is catered too it makes it so much easier to point out the double standards.  </p>

		<p>Arianna Huffington is the ex-wife of one Michael Huffington, who challenged Dianne Feinstein for Senate in California in 1994.  Michael H. was sort of a liberal Rockefeller Republican, and Arianna is and was all along a solid left winger.  As it is, Michael H. has gotten the closest any Republican (so-called) has gotten to winning a Senate seat from CA since the last time any Republican actually won, 1982 IIRC.  (And thanks to demographics, they&rsquo;ll never get any closer.)  Arianna H. took her husband&rsquo;s little bit of minor 15-minute fame and lived on that ever since.</p>

		<p>Well, would anyone expect anything different from Huffy?  My thing is not so much race as CLASS.  My contention is that lower-class people are there by choice   &mdash;   not by mandate or anything else compulsory.  Their own choices put them where they are, and their choices keep them there.  I can guarantee that no lower class blacks or Mexicans are going to read the Huffy Post segregated sections; they&rsquo;re too busy stealing food so they can spend what money they have on drugs.  And it&rsquo;s exactly right - THEIR interests are not MY interests; I want nothing to do with them, and segregation by class is just fine with me.  Guilty white liberals will read this rag - and they deserve what they get by choosing to do so.  Mark my words - civil unrest is just around the corner in America, and no lower class person is going to give anybody Brownie points for reading the Huffy post.  If you&rsquo;re middle class, your chances of getting killed by a lower class member is going to be rising exponentially.  Good luck.</p>

<p>The only thing that unites the rainbow coalition is the bogeyman of &#8216;white oppression and racism&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Take that away, and they&rsquo;d be at each others throats, just as they are in other parts of the world.</p>
