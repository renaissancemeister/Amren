<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70J37P20110120">Over a Million Immigrants Land U.S. Jobs in 2008&#150;10</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed Stoddard, Reuters, January 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Over the past two years, as U.S. unemployment remained near double-digit levels and the economy shed jobs in the wake of the financial crisis, over a million foreign-born arrivals to America found work, many illegally.</p>
<p>Those are among the findings of a review of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau data conducted exclusively for Reuters by researchers at the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston.</p>
<p>Often young and unskilled or semi-skilled, immigrants have taken jobs Americans could do in areas like construction, willing to work for less wages. Others land jobs that unemployed Americans turn up their noses at or lack the skills to do.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the new arrivals, according to employers, brought with them skills required of the building trade and found work in sectors such as construction, where jobless rates are high.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employers have chosen to use new immigrants over native-born workers and have continued to displace large numbers of blue-collar workers and young adults without college degrees,&#8221; said Andrew Sum, the director of the Center for Labor Market Studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the advantages of hiring, particularly young, undocumented immigrants, is the fact that employers do not have to pay health benefits or basic payroll taxes,&#8221; said Sum.</p>
<p>From 2008 to 2010, 1.1 million new migrants who have entered America since 2008 landed jobs, even as U.S. household employment declined by 6.26 million over that same period.</p>
<p>But in a sign of the times, the pace of job growth for new arrivals has also slowed, to an average of 550,000 a year from 2008 to 2010 from over 750,000 a year from 2000 to 2008.</p>
<p>Sum said it was fair to estimate that around 35 percent of these workers were undocumented or illegal.</p>
<p>Many immigrants acquired jobs in traditional low-wage work associated with foreign, undocumented and especially Mexican labor: hotels and food services, retail trade, sanitation, cleaning and construction.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is basically no unskilled immigration that is legal. There are basically no provisions in the law for unskilled immigrants,&#8221; said Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business.</p>
<p>Farm workers in particular argue that Americans would not do the tough field work that is rife with undocumented workers, titling one recent union campaign &#8220;Take Our Jobs&#8221;. The slogan meant that if Americans wanted their jobs, then take them. But it is likely they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Immigrant hiring also comes despite stepped-up workplace enforcement against companies that hire illegal immigrants and the rapid expansion of the online E-verify system used by employers to check immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the 28,500 new arrivals since 2008 who found work in the finance and insurance sector only comprised 2.6 percent of the 1.1 million migrants. Over 90,000 of the newcomers since 2008 got work in health care and social services, a fast-growing sector where skills are in demand.</p>
<p>YOUNG, UNEDUCATED AND WILLING TO WORK</p>
<p>But the demographic profile of the immigrants who are still landing jobs is slanted to the young, uneducated, unskilled or semi-skilled. Accommodations and food services, for example, was a sector that employed over 144,000 new arrivals  &mdash;  the biggest group of employed new immigrants. These would be jobs such as hotel maids and dishwashers.</p>
<p>And 42 percent of the 1.1 million were under 30.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate for all Americans without a high school diploma in this age group is about 27 percent to 29 percent  &mdash;  a level that Sum says is &#8220;Depression scale.&#8221; And in sectors such as construction the unemployment rate is almost 21 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet the analysis by Sum and his colleagues shows that over 86,000 foreign-born workers who arrived in America since 2008 have been employed in the construction sector.</p>
<p>Sum said the whole situation was creating a deeper domestic labor glut at the bottom of the workforce ladder, depressing wages and sharpening already widening income disparities.</p>
<p>But Ezequiel Arvizu, the compliance and diversity representative with federal contractor Sundt Construction in Arizona, said his company had hired new arrivals over the past three years simply because they often have experience that native-born Americans lack.</p>

		<p>What is the purpose of a Nation?</p>
<p>In the olden days, a nation consisted of group of people with a common ethnicity, language, culture, and religion who joined together to form nations for their common good.  </p>
<p>Such associations are natural, because very similar (i.e., homogeneous) people, have common visions and customs, and tend to get along.  </p>
<p>Trying to form nations out of very dissimilar groups of people almost always fails, because it leads to conflict. In fact, nearly all wars have been fought because of racial, ethnic, religious, language, or political differences.  Diversity kills!  Diversity leads to war.  Diversity is a great, great weakness.  Encouraging diversity in any nation is insanity.   </p>

		<p>This is a massive labor subsidy-and transfer of wealth -to the greedy cheating class. And it is a staggeringly massive transfer of wealth from ordinary Native Born White Americans to the greedy cheating class. How does the greedy class justify this great theft. Well, they say diversity is a great blessing to America..what they leave out is that it is great blessing to the greedy cheating class&hellip;but it is a great crime  against millions of ordinry Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Behind every great fortune is a great crime.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans always benefit greatly from a severe labor scarcity which would occur if the 1965 Immigration Reform Act had not been passed. It has been 40 years of a declining real wage for millions of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>America does not have import its doctors,nurses,engineers,school teachers,carpenters,electricians,dry wall workers,plumbers&hellip;any occupation you name it&hellip;. from China,India,Pakistan,Korea,Mexico,Iran,Iraq and the Phillipines. It is all one very big lie.</p>

		<p>Immigration is an issue that divides the elite of both parties from the rank and file. When limousine liberals think of immigrants, especially illegal immigrants, they think of the Statue of Liberty, &#8220;huddled masses yearning to breathe free,&#8221; and so on. <br>
 <br>
Country club Republicans think of becoming richer Republicans, because that is what a high level of immigration enables them to become. A high level of immigration means more customers, and more job applicants. By the law of supply and demand this means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits. </p>

<p>Right on Jupiter!</p>
<p>But few, very few politicians are willing to state this.</p>
<p>From Ron Paul:</p>
<p><i>Though the Federal Reserve policy harms the average American, it benefits those in a position to take advantage of the cycles in monetary policy. The main beneficiaries are those who receive access to artificially inflated money and/or credit before the inflationary effects of the policy impact the entire economy. Federal Reserve policies also benefit big spending politicians who use the inflated currency created by the Fed to hide the true costs of the welfare-warfare state. It is time for Congress to put the interests of the American people ahead of the special interests and their own appetite for big government.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/265tw8d" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/265tw8d</a></p>
<p>Seems the very brave M. Paul is standing alone</p>
<p>Hope Ron has a bullet proof vest, armed body guards and/or a very good defensive legal team.   He&rsquo;s going to need one or all of those things.</p>
<p>Question of the Day:   How soon before he is silenced?</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p><i>Most Americans have no real understanding of the operation of the international money lenders. The accounts of the Federal Reserve System have never been audited. It operates outside the control of Congress and manipulates the credit of the United States.</i> </p>

		<p>I was under the impression that (yearightsure) many Mexicans had left the U.S. due to the so-called &#8216;economic slow-down&rsquo; (don&rsquo;t you love all these coined PC, newsbite terms?). After, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been told to believe. Yesterday, which was not a payday, and in the middle of the day in China-Mart there was a line of 12 Mexicans in line at the money transfer counter. I guess they ARE home.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s get realistic. The illegals might take menial manual-labor type jobs today. But their anchor babies grown into adults   &mdash;   ARE GOING TO COMPETE WITH, TAKE JOBS FROM OUR OWN FUTURE ADULTS!</p>
<p>Conversely, why in hell should the American-born offspring of illegal immigrants be allowed to shove our own legitimate Americans aside in a future where there are fewer and fewer jobs openings to begin with?</p>
<p>Are we Americans really becoming to numbed down by trash TV, the endless hype about sports scores and other meaningless nonsense that we cannot understand what is going on&hellip; what is happening to our nation?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to see the necessity of letting in over a million immigrants to legally work in the United States when unemployment among Americans is over nine percent. There is no job in this country that Americans won&rsquo;t do for a living wage. Unscrupulous political hacks, Neo-Marxist Academics and greedy, prehensile, unpatriotic business interests are behind this unneeded alien invasion of our once great nation.</p>

		<p>There has never been a time in American history where a severe labor shortage has ever been harmfull to American workers&hellip;never.</p>
<p>Take the WW2 era. Immigration was effectively cut off..shut down to 0. What happened? Well, the nation tapped into the domestic labor force to meet its&rsquo; labor needs. White Women in a very short period of time mastered high-skilled trade jobs necessary to build Military aircraft.</p>
<p>Post-war period:America was sill largely labor self-sufficent. There hardly any Chinese-thanks to the Chinese Exclusion Act passed 60 years earlier- in the nation&hellip;and hardly any Mexicans also. There were basically 0 Hindus,Sihks,Pakistanis and Koreans in America during this time period. How did Native Born White America manage to survive during this time period? Very well thank you. Economists refer  to this as the &#8220;Golden Era of American economic growth&#8221;.  Not only that, post-war America was an era of growing economic equality. After 1973, economic growth began to stagnate and economic inequality increased. It is not a coincidence that these two things occured a few years after the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act.</p>
<p>When America was 90 perfcent Native Born White Americam, Twelve Native Born White Amereican Alpha Males were placed on the moon. Someone is telling a very big lie.</p>
<p>The great enthusiasm of the greedy cheating class to rapidly bring about the race-replacment of the Native Born White American Majority is driven and fueled by the incomprehensible level of greed  of the greedy cheating class. There are no economic,ecological and cultural reasons for doing it. Treason is the reason.</p>

		<p>The US isn&rsquo;t really a country any more. It&rsquo;s more an economic zone where all are welcome, and there&rsquo;s no membership priviledges (US citizenship). Foreigners, US politicians and traitors are all laughing at us. Guess the country as a whole isn&rsquo;t going to wake up. Sad. <br>

		<p>I have been wondering about an issue and would like some input from others on this.<br>
I&rsquo;m not sure how to frame my question but here goes.</p>
<p>Do all of the Middle Eastern, Asian, Indian and Mexican immigrants have credit scores when they come here or are they totally empty and clean slate. Does these countries track their peoples credit scores like we do and use the same Experian etc. that we do?<br>
Also isn&rsquo;t there a federal act of some kind that almost guarantees government loans to certain immigrants? Any input and/or links would be appreciated.<br>
