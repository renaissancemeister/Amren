released its periodic projection of the ethnic makeup of the United 
States during the next few decades. It reported cheerfully that if 
current immigration and birth rates hold steady, by the year 2050 the 
percentage of Hispanics will have increased from 10 to 25 percent, that 
of Asians from three to eight percent, and that of blacks from 12 to 14 
percent. All these increases will come at the expense of whites, who are
 projected to fall from 74 percent of the population to about 50 
percent.
        <p>
          Within 54 years, therefore, whites will be on the brink of 
becoming just one more racial minority. And because whites are having so
 few children, they will be an <i>old</i> minority. Within just 34 years
   &mdash;   by 2030   &mdash;   they will already account for less than half the population
 under age 18, but will be three quarters of the population over 65. 
Some of the people reading these words will be alive when these things 
come to pass.

        <p>
          As usual, the Census Bureau&rsquo;s projections stirred little interest. The <i>New York Times</i>
 did note that the projected changes would represent &#8220;a profound 
demographic shift&#8221; and that the future mix of old whites and young 
blacks and Hispanics might give the debate about Social Security &#8220;a 
racial and ethnic tinge.&#8221; This seemed to be the most disturbing thing 
the <i>Times</i> could think of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is there almost complete silence about a population shift 
that, if it takes place, will transform much of the country beyond 
recognition? Why is there no debate about what this would mean in terms 
of education, politics, democracy, the jury system, national unity, 
racial friction, crime, foreign policy, labor productivity, or virtually
 any other national indicator?
        </p>
        <p>
          The demographic future of the United States is perhaps the 
most important question we face, yet it receives no attention. Most 
whites simply refuse to think about what is happening to their country 
or about the third-world future they are ensuring for their children and
 grandchildren. Those who do think about demographic change have been 
browbeaten into believing that it is inevitable and that resistance 
would, somehow, be immoral.
        </p>
        <table class="quoteright">

            <th>Why is there almost complete silence about a population

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          What makes the silence so unaccountable is that there is very 
little mystery about the nature of the changes we can anticipate. Miami 
and Detroit and Monterey Park, California are good examples of what 
happens when a city becomes Hispanic, black, or Asian. The details of 
the transformation are interesting, but it is sufficient to note the 
obvious: Once the concentration of non-whites reaches a certain level, 
whites cannot or will not live among them. Except in a few gilded 
enclaves, there are virtually no whites left in Miami or Detroit or 
Monterey Park. &#8220;White flight&#8221; is a universal fact of American life. 
Liberals may deplore it, but no one can deny it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 1960s and 1970s, whites were generally fleeing blacks, 
but the great black migrations have largely come to an end, and whites 
have reestablished distance between the two races. In recent decades, it
 is massive, non-white immigration that most often drives whites from 
their neighborhoods, and continuing immigration only hardens the alien 
character of these places. No one believes that the arrival of yet more 
Haitians, Guatemalans, Mexicans, Jamaicans, or Vietnamese will somehow 
restore the former character of South Central Los Angeles or Miami and 
induce whites to move back.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process works the other way. As their numbers increase, 
non-whites continue to expand into adjacent areas. Whites, many of whom 
fled their homes in the face of the first incursion, move away once 
again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, will be one of the certain effects of demographic 
change: More and more parts of the United States will become, for 
whites, essentially uninhabitable. It will be <i>physically possible</i>
 for whites to live with the Mexicans of Brownsville, Texas or the 
blacks of Camden, New Jersey but such places will be almost as alien and
 as uninviting as Oaxaca or Mombassa. They will actually be more 
uninviting. The people of Oaxaca and Mombassa like and admire white 
Americans, whereas those of Brownsville and Camden have a strong and 
sometimes violent dislike for whites.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is much irony in the course on which our nation has been
 set. Most white Americans can think of any number of communities or 
neighborhoods in which they might want to live. Not one is likely to 
have a non-white majority. Likewise, most whites cannot name a single 
non-white community in which they could bear to live. Furthermore, if 
one were to ask whites what countries they might move to if given a 
choice, almost all will mention a European country, Canada, Australia, 
or New Zealand. All are white. Our country has therefore embarked on a 
course that will make ever larger parts of it inhospitable, even 
off-limits, to whites. Eventually the country as a whole could become 
one in which whites do not wish to live.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some level, everyone in America understands this. Not even 
the most deluded white liberals live in Harlem or Watts or South Central
 Los Angeles, or in any of a thousand other neighborhoods that have been
 transformed by non-whites. Despite their pronouncements about the vital
 importance and desirability of integration, virtually no white is 
willing to take the most obvious step towards making it happen: buy a 
house in a black neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Destroying the Infrastructure</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Where it matters most   &mdash;   where they make their homes and rear 
their children   &mdash;    even the most liberal whites suddenly demonstrate a 
grasp of reality at odds with what they claim to believe and stand for. 
Even they have noticed that although the details of non-white 
dis-possession differ according to the part of the country and the 
people who arrive, something essential is always lost when whites move 
away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Blacks frighten even the most ardent integrationists. East 
Coast blacks, in particular, have the disconcerting habit of physically 
destroying the cities they move into. Detroit, Newark, the South Bronx, 
Camden, North Philadelphia, and the South Side of Chicago now have huge 
expanses of vacant lots and derelict buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Detroit can no longer afford to serve some of its most 
blighted, sparsely inhabited neighborhoods. It is considering moving out
 the few remaining people and decommissioning whole sections of itself   &mdash;  
 shutting off utilities, stopping mail delivery, pulling out bus lines, 
ending police and fire service, and letting nature take over. There are 
similarly stark proposals for parts of down-town Detroit, where empty 
skyscrapers tower over deserted streets. Some people want to turn the 
area into a theme park for urban architecture   &mdash;   like the ghost towns in 
the West.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blacks have destroyed cities in several ways. One is arson. 
Many East Coast neighborhoods never completely rebuilt after the race 
riots of the 1960s. Today, black youngsters in Detroit, Newark, and 
elsewhere celebrate Halloween eve   &mdash;   which they call Devil&rsquo;s Night   &mdash;   by 
burning down as many houses as they can. Other buildings, often charming
 turn-of-the-century townhouses, become uninhabitable because no one 
bothers to maintain them. Others are simply abandoned as the decent, 
responsible blacks flee crime and degeneracy. The result is the blasted,
 vacant look of so many Eastern black ghettos. Entire cities have slowly
 shifted away from the parts that blacks have occupied, as whites build 
homes and businesses away from the expanding blight. In what were once 
the centers of important cities, whole chapters of urban history have 
been wiped away. Not a trace remains of generations of industrious 
whites who worked hard, reared children, and hoped for a better future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hispanics do not ordinarily tear cities down, though the 1992 
Los Angeles riots showed that they can sometimes burn and loot their own
 neighborhoods just as blacks sometimes do. Likewise, the Puerto Rican 
sections in New York&rsquo;s outer borough can be as menacing as any inhabited
 by blacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hispanics have a different effect. They bring crime and lower 
the quality of public schools   &mdash;   reasons enough for whites to move out   &mdash;   
but they also bring an alienness blacks do not. Many are willing to live
 ten to a room, turn garages into bedrooms, park cars in the front yard,
 keep chickens, and practice a gaudy, third-world version of 
Catholicism. But the greatest sign of alienness is Spanish. The 
airwaves, magazine racks, storefronts, and the very air itself ring with
 a language most whites do not understand. The occasional passing car 
marked &#8220;Police&#8221; rather than &#8220;Policia&#8221; is a reminder that this is still, 
theoretically, the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1991, the president of a black homeowners association in 
South Central Los Angeles explained her opposition to a wave of Mexicans
 moving into a formerly black area: &#8220;It&rsquo;s a different culture, a 
different breed of people. They don&rsquo;t have the same values. You can&rsquo;t 
get together with them. It&rsquo;s like mixing oil and water.&#8221; The 
now-forgotten and long-departed white residents may well have said the 
same things about blacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Asians arrive in large numbers, their effect is more 
ambiguous. Some North Asian groups commit fewer crimes than whites, make
 more money, and do better in school. Others, like the Hmong and the 
Cambodians, have fantastically high rates of poverty and welfare 
dependency. However, <i>it does not matter </i>whether Japanese or 
Chinese build societies that are, in some respects, objectively superior
 to those of Europeans. It matters only that they are <i>different</i>.
        </p>
        <table class="boxright">

        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          When large numbers of North Asian immigrants moved into 
Monterey Park, the long-term white residents did not leave because the 
newcomers rioted, opened crack houses, covered walls with graffiti, or 
were rapists and robbers. They moved out because Monterey Park, in 
countless ways, ceased to be the town in which they had grown up or the 
town to which they had moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          The merchandise in the stores and the faces behind the 
counters changed. So many signs appeared in strange languages that the 
fire department insisted that at least street numbers be legible to 
English-speakers. Even city council meetings began to include exchanges 
in languages other than English. The new-comers reworked zoning laws to 
permit businesses in what had been residential neighborhoods. Asians 
bought the little bungalows whites had lived in, bulldozed them, cut 
down all the trees, and built huge new houses nearly out to the property
 line.
        </p>
        <p>
          All these changes and many others   &mdash;    some of them vastly more 
troubling than issues that are routinely put to the voters to decide   &mdash;   
took place without the permission or consent of the whites who had lived
 there for years. One unhappy resident paid for a billboard that said, 
&#8220;Would the last American to leave Monterey Park please take down the 
flag.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, the significance of racial change does not lie in 
the particulars. It lies in the fact of unwelcome, uncalled for, 
irreversible change. People have every right to expect their children 
and their children&rsquo;s children to be able to grow up and walk in the ways
 of their ancestors. They have a powerful, natural desire that their 
grandchildren be like them   &mdash;   that they speak the same language, sing the
 same songs, tell the same stories, pray to the same God, take pride in 
the same past, hope the same hopes, love the same nation, and honor the 
same traditions. The crucial elements of peoplehood cannot be preserved 
in the face of a flood of aliens, especially when the central 
institutions of the nation itself preach fashionable falsehoods about 
the equivalence of all races, cultures, and peoples.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most people who grew up in America want to grow old in 
America, not in some bustling outpost of Mexico or Southeast Asia. They 
should not have to move to Montana or Idaho in order to grow old with 
people like themselves. Eventually, of course, if the foreign outposts 
continue to expand, there will be no refuge in Montana and Idaho either.
 This, then, is the effect of racial change at the local level: Whites 
become refugees in their own land.
        </p>
        <p>
          What will happen at the national level? We cannot be sure but 
we can guess. Many non-whites now seem genuinely to believe that equal 
treatment requires preferences for themselves. It may yet be possible to
 abolish racial preferences while whites are still a majority, but what 
will prevent their reappearance when whites become a minority?
        </p>
        <p>
          Whites will still have higher incomes than blacks and 
Hispanics, but this will be seen only as proof of white wickedness and 
exploitation. Is it so outlandish to imagine outright confiscation of 
property owned by whites? supplemental taxes for whites? sumptuary laws?
 exclusion from certain professions? Asians will also be a small but 
successful racial minority, and their wealth, too, is likely to attract 
unwelcome government attention.

          What sort of foreign policy would a non-white America have? 
What would it do   &mdash;   or not do   &mdash;   with nuclear weapons? What sort of public
 health standards would it maintain? How would a third-world America 
treat its national parks, its forests, its rivers? So far, only whites 
have shown much interest in the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the long term, there is some doubt that a non-white America
 could even maintain a functioning democracy or any semblance of the 
rule of law. The record of non-white nations suggests not. Even if our 
forms of government survive, what fanciful, anti-white readings will a 
black and Hispanic Supreme Court find in the Constitution? What subjects
 or opinions will be found to lie outside the protection of the First 
Amendment?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Not an Ounce of Sympathy</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          But these will be future concerns. To return to the present, 
in the United States today, there is not an ounce of public sympathy for
 whites who escape when the neighborhood turns black or Mexican. The 
theory is that only ignorant bigots run away from non-whites, but the 
fact is that people with money never even have to face the problem. As a
 very clever man once put it, the purpose of a college education is to 
give people the right attitudes about minorities and the means to live 
as far away from them as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, indeed, college-educated, right-thinking people have come
 up with a whole set of mental exercises for the working class 
unfortunates who do not have the money to send their children to private
 school. The first exercise is to try as hard as possible to believe 
that aliens and strangers are bearers of a special gift called 
diversity. We are not being displaced; we are being enriched and 
strengthened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, the idea that racial diversity is a strength is so 
obviously stupid that only very intelligent people could have thought it
 up. There is not one multi-racial anything in America that doesn&rsquo;t 
suffer from racial friction. Our country has established a gigantic 
system of laws, diversity commissions, racial watchdog groups, EEO 
officers, and outreach committees as part of a huge, clanking machine to
 regulate and try to control racial diversity   &mdash;   this dangerous, volatile
 thing that is supposed to be such a source of strength. People are so 
exhausted by this source of strength that they run from it the first 
chance they get. Families, churches, clubs, and private parties   &mdash;   which 
are not yet regulated by the government   &mdash;   tend to be racially 
homogeneous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing could be more obvious: Diversity of race or tribe or 
language or religion are the main reasons people kill each other on a 
large scale. Diversity   &mdash;   within the same territory   &mdash;   is strife, not 
strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another comical idea is that a &#8220;diverse&#8221; workforce is somehow a
 great advantage for business or world trade. This is one of those 
giant, untested notions that otherwise skeptical people swallow without a
 gurgle. Ninety-nine percent of the things we buy have nothing to do 
with &#8220;diversity.&#8221; No one cares whether his computer was assembled by a 
Chinaman or a Dane or whether his bread was baked by a robot or a 
chimpanzee.

        <p>
          It does <i>not</i> take an Irishman to sell things to the 
Irish. The world&rsquo;s most successful trading nations today are Japan, 
Korea, Taiwan, and even China, none of which has even heard of 
&#8220;diversity&#8221; or &#8220;tolerance.&#8221; American companies are full of blather about
 multi-racial workforces that &#8220;look like America&#8221;   &mdash;   and are constantly 
being whipped in their own markets by workforces that look like 
Yokohama.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, people seem to be too dazed by this 
incomprehensible diversity argument to notice that it seems to be only 
whites who suffer from the paralysis of homogeneity and for whom 
diversity is going to be such a tonic. No one is urging Howard 
University, which is overwhelmingly black, to recruit Hispanics or 
Asians so its students can benefit from racial diversity. No one is 
suggesting that Mexico should start an immigration program to reduce 
Hispanics to a minority in a few decades. But if racial diversity is 
such a great thing for the United States, why not for Mexico, too? Why 
not for Howard and for all the other &#8220;historically black&#8221; universities?
        </p>
        <p>
          If white Americans were pouring across the border into Mexico 
demanding that their children be educated in English, insisting on 
welfare, demonstrating for ballot papers in English rather than Spanish,
 demanding voting rights for aliens, celebrating July 4th rather than 
Cinco de Mayo, could anyone trick the Mexicans into thinking this was 
joyous diversity? No. The Mexicans would recognize an invasion when they
 saw one. They would open fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          There used to be much talk about &#8220;ugly Americans,&#8221; who 
traveled over-seas expecting to find hamburgers and English-speakers, 
and who ignorantly deprecated the quaint customs of the natives. We were
 supposed to be deeply ashamed of them   &mdash;   and they were only tourists! 
&#8220;Ugly Mexicans&#8221; and &#8220;ugly Haitians&#8221; come here <i>to live permanently,</i>
 but we are supposed to be endlessly sensitive to their peculiarities, 
and revel in the diversity of toadying to their ethnic demands.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;Racial diversity,&#8221; therefore, is strictly a one-way street. 
Only whites are ever expected to practice it or benefit from it. The 
ultimate insult is to expect whites to <i>celebrate</i> diversity. This 
is nothing less than asking them to celebrate their own capitulation, 
their dwindling numbers and declining influence. The astonishing thing 
is that so many whites actually do go through the motions of rejoicing 
in their decline.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Just Deserts</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, a few whites refuse to believe that dispossession 
is a fine thing. For these stubborn cases, there is a completely 
different argument to justify demographic shift: Whites took America 
away from the Indians, so it is now someone else&rsquo;s turn. This argument 
is made by the same people who chant the mantra of diversity, but it 
implicitly concedes that diversity is a fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diversity advocates <i>never</i> suggest that what happened to
 the Indians was a good thing. But have Indians not benefited more than 
any other people in history from the joys of precisely the kind of 
diversity whites are, today, supposed to welcome? If diversity is to be 
celebrated, it should be Christmas all year &#8220;round for the Indians. Of 
course, no one tries to make this point. The 
you-took-itaway-from-the-Indians argument recognizes that the European 
conquest of the continent was a catastrophe for Indians and that what is
 happening now is a catastrophe for whites. It is a catastrophe whites 
are supposed to accept cheerfully because they took America from its 
rightful owners.

          But this, too, is a completely one-sided argument. The 
Cherokee, for example, took away the land of an earlier group called the
 Mound Builders. Why are they known as the Mound Builders? Because the 
Cherokee exterminated them and no one even knows their name. All that is
 left of them are their strange earthworks.

          If whites are supposed to stand aside while every third-world 
tribe marches into the United States because whites took the country 
from Indians, then the Cherokee should have stood aside for the 
Europeans   &mdash;   because they took the place away from the Mound Builders. 
Needless to say, current orthodoxy holds that for Indians it makes no 
difference how many people they killed to get the land or how recently; 
it was theirs to defend with every means at their disposal. Whites, on 
the other hand, have an unending debt not just to the descendants of the
 peoples they refrained from exterminating but to every other non-white 
people on the face of the earth. Just like fairy tales about the joys of
 diversity, the land-title argument is used exclusively to criticize and
 demoralize whites.

          <b>Successful Societies</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          What is it, though, that gives rise to movements of peoples 
and debates about who has rights to the land? It is the fact that whites
 build successful societies non-whites want to move into. Generous 
Nicaraguans and Haitians do not come to America eager to share the gift 
of &#8220;diversity&#8221; with poor, benighted white people who are about to expire
 from a galloping case of homogeneity. They come because their societies
 don&rsquo;t work and they know life will be better here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same process is at work in Europe, Australia, Canada, and 
New Zealand. Whites establish the most desirable societies in the 
history of man. Desperate people from failed, non-white societies are 
willing to risk nearly everything   &mdash;    sometimes even their lives   &mdash;    for a
 chance to live in these societies.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Europeans had turned North American into a giant pesthole 
no one would want to come. No one would then have to think up reasons 
why everyone had the right to come, or why whites actually benefit from 
being outnumbered and pushed aside by people unlike themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same is true on a smaller scale. Rarely is it ever said, 
but in the United States virtually every desirable place to live, work, 
or go to school is desirable because whites made it that way. Non-whites
 naturally want access to these places even if they did not   &mdash;   and could 
not   &mdash;   create them. This is why it is always non-whites who are pushing 
their ways into white institutions   &mdash;   never the other way around   &mdash;   and 
why all the overblown dramas of &#8220;exclusion,&#8221; &#8220;tolerance,&#8221; &#8220;justice,&#8221; and
 &#8220;racism&#8221; are played out on white territory and put whites on the 
defensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whites are not, of course, clamoring to get into Howard 
University, live in Harlem, or to move to Guatemala. But if there were 
something rare and desirable in those places, the non-whites who made 
them desirable would fight like demons to keep others out.
        </p>

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          The sad truth is that, generally speaking, once non-whites 
have gotten what they want, and have arrived in large numbers in what 
were previously white institutions or neighborhoods, those institutions 
and neighborhoods slowly lose the qualities that attracted non-whites in
 the first place. Whites leave, and the spoor of European man begins to 
fade. For the most part, third-world immigrants eventually recreate in 
the United States the societies they left behind   &mdash;    with all the 
shortcomings that prompted them to leave home in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mystery in all this is not why non-whites want the 
benefits of white society, but why whites are so willing to hand over to
 strangers the land of their ancestors   &mdash;   why they appear to be so 
willing to permit aliens to occupy and transform their nation. Just like
 every other argument about race in America today, white passivity is 
based on yet another double standard: Non-whites have powerful and 
legitimate group interests but whites do not.

        <p>
          Before he was assassinated, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin explained that what mattered most to him as an Israeli was that 
his country remain at least 80 percent Jewish. No one suggested that Mr.
 Rabin was a bigot or hatemonger   &mdash;   and of course he was not. He was 
merely stating the obvious: That if Israel ceased to be predominantly 
Jewish it would change in irreversible ways that would be intolerable to
 Jews.

        <table class="quoteright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <th>Virtually every desirable place to live, work, or go to school is desirable because whites made it that way. </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          Mexicans, Japanese, Algerians, Senegalese   &mdash;   all non-whites 
understand that demographic transformation is a national calamity. It is
 so obvious it need not even be stated. For whites it is just as much a 
national calamity, and the morality and reasoning of a white who wants 
America to stay at least 80 percent white are exactly the same as those 
of Yitzhak Rabin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The forms of civility, the folkways, the demeanor and the 
texture of life that whites take for granted cannot survive the embrace 
of large numbers of aliens. The things whites love most about culture 
and human society have not survived in Detroit and Miami. It is not 
considered &#8220;nice&#8221; to say so; it prompts shouts of &#8220;racism&#8221; to say so. 
But it is because the things they love have not survived that whites 
have moved away from Detroit and Miami. Individually, whites react in an
 entirely natural way to racial change. <i>American Renaissance</i> is unusual only in making explicit what virtually all whites feel but never say.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crisis that whites face today is that for fear of being 
called &#8220;racists,&#8221; for fear of being thought not nice, they seem prepared
 to let their country change in ways that they know will not be an 
improvement. How can it be good for America   &mdash;   or good for whites   &mdash;   for 
it to become increasingly like those very parts of the country in which 
they refuse to live?

          Whites are so fearful of the charge of &#8220;racism&#8221; that they are 
unwilling even to discuss what they might do to avoid leaving a 
third-world nation to their grandchildren. Whites are therefore 
preparing to pass on to future generations a nation in which they might 
well be unwilling to live.
        </p>
        <p>
          The colonists did not fight for independence from Britain in 
order for our generation to turn this country over to Mexicans and 
Haitians. The Founders did not frame the Constitution to celebrate 
diversity. Americans did not spill their blood at Gettysburg or in 
Europe or the Pacific for multiculturalism. And yet, the rightful heirs 
to what could have been a shining beacon of Western Civilization are 
giving up their country without a struggle   &mdash;   for fear that to do 
otherwise would be &#8220;racist.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          What we are witnessing is one of the great tragedies in human 
history. Powerful forces are in motion that, if left unchecked, will 
slowly push aside European man and European civilization and then dance a
 victory jig on their collective grave. If we do nothing, the nation we 
leave to our children and grandchildren will be a desolated, third-world
 failure, in which whites will be a despised minority. Western 
Civilization will be a faint echo, vilified if it is even audible. There
 is no other tragedy that is at once so great, so unnatural, and so 
unnecessary.  <img src="../../../../ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" width="11" height="11"/>

		<p>Nothing beats Jared Taylor&rsquo;s &#8216;Banned in Halifax&rsquo; speech, but this is one of his better articles. It&rsquo;s a shame it&rsquo;s one of his more racist ones - tying the survival of white societies to the idea that non-whites cannot build successful societies of their own. It&rsquo;s not something I need to believe in order to feel better - while being dispossessed by these same people of color. There are so many legitimate issues to grip about that do make me feel better. Sometimes Taylor is hardly &#8216;racist&rsquo; at all. </p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m being reduced to a minority what does it matter if the people replacing me are creating a better society or an unpleasant one. The more &#8216;racists&rsquo; say this, the more &#8216;anti-racists&rsquo; act to prove this isn&rsquo;t true, even if every white must be dumbed down, shut out, and shut up, and if every other nation on Earth must send us free goods propping us up, and no matter how many completely crazy we have to change the laws of the land. It&rsquo;s a large world out there, they&rsquo;ll continue to prop us up if need be. It will probably be worth it too them, having someplace to send their discontents. </p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s left out, especially by the main stream media and the public face of diversity: whites moving away in white flight migrations are doing so as a result of being exposed to non-whites. They&rsquo;ve already experienced the racism of people of color, for real, they don&rsquo;t want to experience more. These same diversicrats respond to white flight by encouraging non-whites to be even more race-conscious and &#8216;racist&rsquo; against whites, and then to celebrate. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter how racist they are - only shutting whites up. Mr. Taylor is right about one thing. They will dance on our graves. They&rsquo;ll especially have to if America is indeed turned into a &#8216;third-world pool&rsquo;. Celebrating our demise and kicking any or our remaining ancestors will be the one thing making it bearable for them. </p>

		<p>&#8220;There used to be much talk about &ldquo;ugly Americans,&rdquo; who traveled over-seas expecting to find hamburgers and English-speakers, and who ignorantly deprecated the quaint customs of the natives. We were supposed to be deeply ashamed of them  &mdash;  and they were only tourists!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was even a book by that name &#8216;The Ugly America&rsquo;. During the 1970&rsquo;s, the Bob Seeger band did a song called &#8216;Beautiful Loser&rsquo;. The song is about a guy one could say is the politically correct opposite of the ugly American. The song was quite a bit less world famous. </p>

		<p>Do you realize where America is headed? Unless we can turn it around, America will only be 20% white by 2100 and whites will be extinct 100 years after that. Do the math yourself. Whites as a percentage of the population have been declining at about the rate of 1/2 of 1% each year. So, the past and the future looks like this unless the trend is halted  &mdash;  </p>
<p>1960- 90% white<br/>
1970- 85% white<br/>
1980- 80% white<br/>
1990- 75% white<br/>
2000- 70% white<br/>
2010- 65% white  (THIS IS WHERE WE&rsquo;RE AT NOW)<br/>
2020- 60% white<br/>
2030- 55% white<br/>
2040- 50% white<br/>
2050- 45% white<br/>
2060- 40% white<br/>
2070- 35% white<br/>
2080- 30% white<br/>
2090- 25% white<br/>
2100- 20% white  (20% white at the-turn-of-the-century!)<br/>
2110- 15% white<br/>
2120- 10% white<br/>
2130-  5% white<br/>
2140-  0% white  EXTINCTION!</p>
<p>I heard an Asian-America recently suggest that perhaps whites should be put on &#8220;reservations&#8221; when they fall to a tiny percentage of the population so that their population and culture could be perserved. He suggested the foothills of the Appalachians because white people tend to do well in mountainous areas. Another good place would be the Great Basin of the Rockies for the white Mormons. This wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea, for then white people would have control over their own laws and destinies, just as Native Americans have control of their destinies on their own reservations!</p>

		<p>Prior to retirement I was periodicly subjected to &#8220;diversity training&#8221; at work. I&rsquo;d sit through the fantasy propaganda and bite my tongue, hoping to get out sooner. Some could not keep quiet. They raised similar points to this article. The instructor got hysterical over the fact that they disagreed with the stuff being presented. You were chastised for pointing out that your European ancestors came here legally, asked for nothing worked hard and adapted to American society as opposed to what is going on today. This same propaganda is being spread in our schools as well. Time is running out to put a stop to this madness. Like it or not this country was built by White Christians into the greatest ever. The decline of the past 40 years or so mirrors the rise of minorities and the propaganda that this is a good thing. If we don&rsquo;t wake up soon we are done.</p>

<p>Since the late 1960&rsquo;s America has had a large and growing trade deficit, year after year, every year. Economist George Gilder may chime in that &#8216;trade deficits don&rsquo;t matter&rsquo;, but after 40 years&hellip; this can only be explained away by the most creative of accounting practices. This trade deficit is separate from the national debt of the US government. It seems clear to me anyway, that at the bottom of the page, on the bottom line, our trading partners are sending us stuff for nothing. We do maintain a large military and the accompanying research, out of proportion to what other countries must maintain. </p>

		<p>Mr. Taylor is superb.  I applaud all of his points.  But, I wish AR would spend more time prompting our people to increase our birth rate.  This issue is the alpha and the omega. </p>
<p>If every white woman married a white man, practiced traditional christian values, and had 4-5 children, we would have nothing to talk about.  All of the maladies so well articulated above would be drastically attenuated.  At the root of all of our problems is the collapse of the white birth rate.  The catalyst for the mass migrations of third world people into the West has been and will be the need of our economic engine for labor, because the sumps have gone dry in the dirth of births by Americans, primarily white Americans.  White people should stop complaining.  We brought it on ourselves.  Our desire to surround ourselves with material trinkets instead of children will in the end bury us.  If you want to do something, get married and procreate.  If you are to old, help a young family have more children.  Wake up!  Civilizations rise on the backs of young people and cave in on the backs of the old societies.  </p>
<p>How many out there even have children, let alone more than two.<br/>
And it is always the same story.  We can&rsquo;t afford more. Bull!</p>

		<p>I see a lot of things that would suggest this country is winding down and coming to an end.  When was the last time America had a predominate White culture?  The 1980s?  That was a generation ago.  Economically we are decaying.  Before 1980 the US was the largest creditor nation in the world and was loaning money to all the other countries.  This nation led in virtually every industry imaginable and had the highest standard of living in the world.  Now the Europeans and the Japanese have surpassed us in the quality of life. Our educational system, once the best in the world, is now the laughingstock of the industrial world.  The most troublesome thing is that our gene pool has been compromised.  People do not look that same as they used to even 30 years ago and I suspect it&rsquo;s because people are not practicing racial hygiene and are marrying people with trace amounts of nonwhite DNA. I see people with Germanic last names who appear White in most respects and they have shiny black hair and dark eyes.  These are genetic traits of Amerindians, Gypsies and Southeast Asians, not Europeans.  <br/>
These things I find troublesome and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any historical precedent for a nation in decline to suddenly reverse that decline.  Britain fell, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, the Romans, the Greeks, all the great powers of the world came and gone and it&rsquo;s naive to think that America is immune, in fact the signs seem to indicate the process has been going on for nearly 40 years.  I pray I&rsquo;m wrong.<br/>

		<p>Check out &#8220;anti-racist education&#8221;  &mdash;  -it is the new educational model to replace multicultural education; where students from K-12+ will be taught that non-whites don&rsquo;t perform as well academically or economically as whites do because of white racism (used to keep them down). Academia plans on tesching hatred of whites! Zimbabwe is held up as a shining example by Enid Lee and associates (google it), a leader in the development of this model of teaching. There&rsquo;ll be NO tolerance for us white devils!<br/>
   Meanwhile, I have some hope for the white birthrate with the Quiverful movement  &mdash;  -conservative Christians that don&rsquo;t use birth control, therefore have as many children as God intends them to have  &mdash;  -and they overwhelmingly do home-schooling, which keeps their kids away from the degradations of non-white influence, they aren&rsquo;t held back by a dumbed-down curricula and the emerging anti-racist education. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Not even the most deluded white liberals live in Harlem or Watts or South Central Los Angeles, or in any of a thousand other neighborhoods that have been transformed by non-whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Bill Clinton may be the exception.  I belive he has/had a residence in Harlem.</p>

<p>Certainly it would solve the problems mentioned above, but we would be faced with the exacerbation of a problem which is already almost as bad as the racial one:  overpopulation.  If each white woman had roughly two children, then we could sustain our population, which would, combined with a halt to immigration and a reduction of minority birthrates, solve all the problems above AND wouldn&rsquo;t create a new one.</p>

<p>It is not bull. They can&rsquo;t afford more. The will to live, and therefore to procreate, of whites is being drained away by the heavy taxation of the welfare-warfare state. This is true of welfare states throughout the First World, although the Blue State True Believers and their soft-Marxist counterparts in Europe will deny it. The minority &#8220;tax consumers&#8221; reproduce without thinking. They are more secure in their incomes and perks than taxpayers. Do you doubt it? Then remember that their livelihoods are guaranteed through taxes - taxes that are collected, if need be, at bayonet-point. Can you say the same for your salary? Reducing minority-heavy entitlements would ease the tax burden on those who produce wealth through their capital, thrift, industry, and inventiveness. The productive would have less disincentive to reproduce, and inner-city &#8220;babymamas&#8221; would think twice about rolling out yet more kids.</p>

		<p>When this article was written in 1996 the crime rate in the United States was 5,087.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. By 2009 it had declined to 3,465.5 per 100,000 inhabitants.<br/>

This decline did not happen because a diverse population is more peaceful than a majority white population. It did not happen because of liberal social reform and social welfare spending. It happened largely because the prison population grew from 739,980 in 1990 to 1,428,187 in 2000. Nevertheless, it did happen. <br/>

It is true that a high rate of immigration has an inflationary effect on prices, and a deflationary effect on wages. The high white birth rate, which is advocated by many who contribute to American Renaissance, would have the same effect.</p>

		<p>&#8220;No one believes that the arrival of yet more Haitians, Guatemalans, Mexicans, Jamaicans, or Vietnamese will somehow restore the former character of South Central Los Angeles or Miami and induce whites to move back.&#8221;<br/>

A number of old neighborhoods in American cities have been gentrified by the influx of young, well educated, affluent white professionals. I observed this happen to the Adams Morgan neighborhood in Washington, DC. Downtown San Jose, and the Mission District in San Francisco. One of the things that attracts these upscale whites is the cultural diversity provided by immigrants. A more effective - that is to say more draconian - criminal justice system would contribute to further gentrification.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Not even the most deluded white liberals live in Harlem or Watts or South Central Los Angeles, or in any of a thousand other neighborhoods that have been transformed by non-whites. Despite their pronouncements about the vital importance and desirability of integration, virtually no white is willing to take the most obvious step towards making it happen: buy a house in a black neighborhood.&#8221; <br/>

I actually read that Harlem is being gentrified. Nevertheless, the main demographic problem facing the United States, and more particularly the white population, is not caused by immigrants. It is caused by the fact that blacks have disappointed the hopes raised for them by integrationists during the civil rights movement. <br/>
 <br/>
This problem can be handled by replacing Aid to Families with Dependent Children with free abortion on demand, and by building more prisons faster, and filling them quickly. </p>

		<p>&#8220;When Asians arrive in large numbers, their effect is more ambiguous. Some North Asian groups commit fewer crimes than whites, make more money, and do better in school&hellip;However, it does not matter whether Japanese or Chinese build societies that are, in some respects, objectively superior to those of Europeans. It matters only that they are different.</p>
<p>&#8220;When large numbers of North Asian immigrants moved into Monterey Park, the long-term white residents did not leave because the newcomers rioted, opened crack houses, covered walls with graffiti, or were rapists and robbers. They moved out because Monterey Park, in countless ways, ceased to be the town in which they had grown up or the town to which they had moved.&#8221;<br/>

Because of the success of North Asian economies, the United States is not being overrun by Mongoloid hordes. The influx of Vietnamese war refugees following the War in Vietnam was a temporary phenomenon. <br/>
 <br/>
It is true that Orientals in the United States earn their reputation as &#8220;the ideal minority.&#8221; As such they are an affront to those other minorities - and to their white liberal apologists - who blame their obvious deficiencies on &#8220;white racism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Sorry #11 you are wrong. Our first Black President does indeed have an office in a state office building in Harlem, but just try to imagine the cost and the level of protection for this ruse. Where he maintains his legal New York State residence is quite another story. Chappaqua the last I looked for a village or community has about as much racial diversity as does the State of Vermont. I imagine Mr Clinton was not aware of this and probably never noticed the difference between his home village and Harlem.</p>

		<p>&#8220;America will only be 20% white by 2100 and whites will be extinct 100 years after that&#8221;.</p>
<p>People are living to be 80 years old, so I&rsquo;m not convinced whites will be completely extinct in North America in 190 years. Life expectancy may well reach 100. Of course remaining whites may be driven out or expelled if things like &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, very high inflation, and &#8216;the death tax&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t enough to keep them from being the wealthy class and the envy of all the others whites &#8216;oppress&rsquo;.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Eventually, of course, if the foreign outposts continue to expand, there will be no refuge in Montana and Idaho either. This, then, is the effect of racial change at the local level: Whites become refugees in their own land.&#8221;</p>
<p>  This is happening already. This country is not the same one I grew up in. The complete racial transformation of our country will mean: our history, folkways, traditions, and possibly our language will be re-written, and re-interpreted by the non-white immigrants and their descendants. This is the first time in history that a people have given away their children&rsquo;s posterity. Yes, America will survive but it won&rsquo;t be America; it will be shadow of its former glory  &mdash;  a grim, violent, environmentally decayed, and overcrowded, Soviet style Brazil, without the sense of joy and fun that make that country livable.</p>

		<p>Dear Lord. How I remember the good ole days and YES!(no matter what the lying idiots try to tell us) they WERE the good ole days back in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s. When America was mostly White, no desegregation in full bloom and spreading, no AA or quotas, no 1965 nonwhite Immigration Act and the list goes on. I grew up then and I compare today with then and there is NO comparison in the affirmative of today&rsquo;s America. America was America back then because America was WHITE! There is no other reason, period.</p>

<p>Whites are not the cause of overpopulation.  That honor goes exclusively goes to non-whites.  Even if we could convince every white woman to give birth to four children each they would all be &#8220;viable&#8221;.  Some would have birth defects that would prevent them from reproducing in one way or another.  Some would be born gay.  Some would die before having children.  So even four children per woman would not skyrocket the white population.  I might also point out that whites are quite capable of living in densely populated cities.  Clean, safe cities that wouldn&rsquo;t require people driving one and two hours from the suburbs to their jobs.  Suburbs that are frequently built over previously productive farm land that should have been left as productive farm land.  </p>

		<p>#8 TriKleur, outnumbering them is hardly a guarantee. Perhaps one needs reminded it&rsquo;s whites that have allowed this insanity to take hold. Just being white isn&rsquo;t the answer. Being an educated, independent, non-liberal white is. And it seems there&rsquo;s more of the other kind right now than there are of us. </p>

		<p>Just an update for poster #11. As of the 2000 census Chappaqua covers an area of about 10 sq mi with a population of about 9,500 with an annual avg income of 163K. As for racial diversity the Village/Town is all of .09% black, that must be what drew the Clinton&rsquo;s there, so much diversity.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see any critical comments, so I assume another point of view is not welcome.  Anyway, the idea that people of a particular skin color can all be categorized as having a single mindset is just not true. Human beings are a diverse lot, regardless of color. Since white Americans  have maintained power for so long, the fear of loss of that power is understandable. But the nature of the world is change, and as history has shown, power structures change. As a white skinned human, I would never assume that  white skinned people will always be in the majority in this country or anywhere else. It certainly isn&rsquo;t that way in the rest of the world. Eventually we will get a taste of what its like to be a minority and what its like to be on the other side. Its a given. The world will change whether we like it or not. Those of us currently in power can have a hand in that change by showing a little class and by continuing to make this world a better place, or we can be dragged into reality kicking and screaming about how unfair it is, which would have nothing to do with our skin color, and everything to do with our character. </p>

		<p>This diversification is even hitting the small town I live in.  Nowhere is safe.  I&rsquo;m convinced the state capitol is increasingly moving poor blacks into our area.  How would they get here otherwise? They have no automobiles and can be seen walking alongside the road at different hours of the day.  There are strings of ethnic restaurants popping up with Mexicans having an illegal clientele for them.  Japanese, Chinese, Thai, and all the kitchen work can brought in from their own countries with an unskilled worker visa.  One has already closed down and I&rsquo;m hoping our town has enough sense to boycott them, yet I can&rsquo;t believe too many people here have a taste for raw fish and seaweed. Send them packing!</p>

<p>NONSENSE!  It is NOT called &#8220;skin color&#8221;!  It is called RACE! As for you being a &#8220;white skinned person&#8221; I have my doubts about that one. You may have White skin but that sure doesn&rsquo;t make you White, whatsoever. You sound like you want us all to roll over and say goodbye to our race and our nations that WE built. NONwhites make up 92% of this world and you want us to roll over and die and not preserve our own race and nations? Sounds very suspicious to me.</p>
<p> As for your definition of character and class, I would say you are the one who needs some since you say we should give it all away to the &#8220;people of color&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I lived and worked in Silicon Valley for 16 years in the all-white male dominated IT industry. Then in 1998 Bill Clinton ooened the floodgates to millions of Asians, mostly from India and China and now the CA econ is dead and the CA gov&rsquo;t bankrupt. Asians can build sucessful societies? Take a trip to India and see what our future looks like if we do not reverse this.</p>
<p>From 1978-1998 IT was 98% white American males culminating in the biggest economic boom in U.S. History in the late 90s. Clinton signed the massive guest worker visa increases in Oct. 1998 and the rest is history.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s last corporate holdout - Apple - still hires a majority of white Americans and Apple is about to overtake Exxon as the most valuable U.S. Company. The others are all dead or dying, including Microsoft. What more proof do you need? If America loses its whiteness, we are facing a dangerous 3rd world anarchy on a global scale. Picture a worldwide Darfur or India. Not a pretty idea.</p>
<p>Lest you say What about China!, let&rsquo;s not forget that 12 years ago China was dirt poor and it is only by way of the industries and inventions the white genius created that China has been able to rise. That and an illegal currency that violates WTO guidelines.</p>
