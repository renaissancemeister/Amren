<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2224843&amp;nid=836">Official: DomRep to Continue Deporting Migrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ezequiel Abiu Lopez, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), January 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Dominican Republic&rsquo;s top immigration official said Monday the nation will keep deporting Haitian migrants despite criticism by human rights groups of stepped up efforts to catch illegal border crossers.</p>
<p>The government sent roughly 1,000 Haitians back to their earthquake-shattered homeland last week, deploying soldiers and immigration officials to set up border patrols and surprise checkpoints last week along highways, asking people aboard public buses and vans for their papers.</p>
<p>Dominican immigration director Sigfrido Pared said Monday that the government is compelled to resume immigration enforcement to prevent the flow of illegal Haitian migrants since last January&rsquo;s earthquake and to stop the spread of cholera, which has killed more than 3,000 people in Haiti and sickened about 150 in the neighboring Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>He also said the crackdown is urgent &#8220;because a massive entry of Haitians always occurs in January.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pared said the Dominican Republic was complying with a 1999 bilateral protocol to allow deportees to gather their belongings and not be separated from their families. Officials are also obligated to halt deportations after nightfall and on weekends.</p>

		<p>Dominicans have an abiding and long time distrust and dislike [hate] of the Haitian? Go to the wiki and see the entry under the Parsley Massacre. The stats regarding the number of dead are just mind-boggling. The Dominicans want to keep their country for the Domincans. I know that is hard for some to understand.</p>

		<p>The Haitians should be happy, a Dominican friend of mine told me they used to just shoot any Haitian they could catch that crossed the border. </p>

		<p>The Dominican Republic has EVERY RIGHT to deport Haitian people from its borders. Many of these Haitians are diseased, virtually all of them are dirt-poor and they present a strain on the Dominican Republic&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p>
<p>Compare the Dominican Republic&rsquo;s response to Haitians with their cholera, compared to Obama&rsquo;s do-nothing approach last year, when Mexicans with swine flu poured into the United States. Obama said he would not close the border, remember?</p>

		<p>I was in Haiti twenty-five years ago. Today&rsquo;s pictures look no different despite the millions of dollars that have flowed into that country for years, especially since last January&rsquo;s earthquake. Haiti is one of those third-world countries that will never change. As long as the corrupt governments continue a strangle hold on it, it will remain the same poverty-stricken place it has been for far too long. Aid money never reaches the people, just like Mexico. Therefore, it will continue to be a drain on developed nations. I don&rsquo;t know the answer, but I do know we need to stop pouring money into these places when it puts a strain on us. We are in no shape now to add more misery to our country. Mexico could be a world power with its natural resources, but that will never happen there anymore than in Haiti.</p>

		<p>Why do these human rights groups insist that victims of disasters &#8220;share&#8221; their misery with others? The Dominican Republic is a poverty-stricken country itself. How can imposing their misery on others who really can&rsquo;t help be the thing to do? Many groups and much money have gone into helping Haiti, but with the human element at its worst, aid seldom gets to the people it&rsquo;s supposed to. The US has taken in survivors from an earthquake in Central American at least 12 years ago. They are still here. When the US become indundated with third world people, we go under. Then, there will be no one left to help anyone else. We have to take in the people here, assume their upkeep and still are expected to pour money into these nations. Teach them how to survive and don&rsquo;t let them be forever dependent.</p>
