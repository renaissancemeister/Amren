<h1>Refugees Stir Greek Anger</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marc Champion and Alkman Granitsas, Wall Street Journal, January 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Turkey&rsquo;s decision to open its borders for visa-free travel from countries in the Middle East and Africa has helped unleash a flood of illegal immigrants into the European Union, border officials here said Monday.</p>
<p>The main conduit is just outside this unassuming Greek town near Turkey&rsquo;s border, where fields of garlic and brush form the only dry-land border between Greece and Turkey. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Greek and EU border officials describe an explosion of such illegal immigrants, who they say are taking advantage of a cheap, safe expressway to Europe&rsquo;s borderless Schengen area, of which Greece is member. Here, the Schengen area abuts another open-travel zone, the informal visa-free zone developing in the East, around Turkey. </p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone gets to Istanbul by plane, flying on cheap tickets from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and so on. Then it&rsquo;s a three-hour car ride to Edirne [a Turkish city on the border] and a short walk to Greece,&#8221; said Mr. Salamagkas [Georgios Salamagkas, chief of police for the Orestiada district]. That makes fees to human traffickers lower, too, as little as €200 ($260) in some cases, compared with the thousands required to travel by dangerous sea routes, he said.</p>
<p>According to Frontex, the EU border-support agency that deployed 175 people to help protect the frontier here, Greece now accounts for 90% of all detections of illegal crossings into the EU. Estimates of the number of immigrants now living in Greece range from 500,000 to two million, huge figures for a nation of 11 million that is more used to sending emigrants abroad.</p>
<p>In Greece, feelings are running high. To stop the flow of immigrants, Greece is planning to build a fence across the fields. Anti-immigrant protesters clashed with police in riots over the weekend. The flood of immigrants is an unwelcome, if small strain on public finances at a time when the country is in deep recession and slashing budgets. </p>
<p>In recent years, Turkey has signed visa-free travel agreements with Syria, Iran, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Jordan, among others. Citizens of many other countries, including Iraq, can buy visas at the border. {snip}<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Greek police estimate more than a quarter of its 54,000-strong force  &mdash;  and roughly the same amount of its €200 million annual police budget  &mdash;  is consumed with combating illegal immigration, cutting forces available to fight rising recession-era crime levels. </p>

		<p>India just completed the 4,000 kilometer fence around Bangladesh. That is 2,500 miles for us Americans. A high double fence with razor wire in between, some sections lit at night, patrolled by armed guards equipped with assault rifles.</p>
<p>India can do it. Why cannot the rest of the world? High fences make for good neighbors?</p>

		<p>So the article essentially admits that the Greece spends an amount equal to its police force budget stopping illegal immigrants from crossing the border yet it also states that immigrants are a &#8216;small&rsquo; burden to the Greek economy?</p>
<p>Where is the consistency here?</p>
<p>The mass exodus of people toward Europe is already occurring from Turkey and the latter isn&rsquo;t even yet in the European Union.</p>
<p>Can you imagine what will happen should Turkey be granted accession? Millions of not only Turks, but also Arabs will immediately pour into Europe legally and end our civilization once and for all. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

The flood of immigrants is an unwelcome, if small strain on public finances at a time when the country is in deep recession and slashing budgets.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Greek police estimate more than a quarter of its 54,000-strong force &mdash; and roughly the same amount of its €200 million annual police budget &mdash; is consumed with combating illegal immigration, cutting forces available to fight rising recession-era crime levels. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>By inserting a single paragraph of pablum inbetween.</p>
<p>At current exchange rates, 50 million Euros is 65 million USD.</p>
<p>And of course all these lovely people are coming from the nation that wants to be an EU partner.  The nation whose own immigrants are among those least wanted in Europe.</p>
<p>Tell me, what does an Iraqi, Algeria, Libyan or Jordanian illegal immigrant find to do in a land whose language he doesn&rsquo;t speak and which has a budget deficit amounting to 144% of GDP?</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, Greece has the largest budget deficit in all of Europe, exceeding even Ireland an Italy.  They just signed for 150 billion (with a B) Euro emergency spending allocation in trade for promises to bring their deficit down to around +9% of budgeted funds.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t take a small, arid, mountainous nation and dogpile them with illegal immigration and not expect _BIG_ fiscal problems to result.<br>

You left out the crucial part of the article that explains the Turkish side.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s true we are making visa agreements with some countries, to boost trade and tourism, but it&rsquo;s not correct to say this is getting people illegally to other countries,&#8221; said Selcuk Unal, a spokesman for the Turkish foreign ministry. Turkey, he said, detained 260,000 illegal immigrants and 9,000 people-traffickers in the past eight years, and has itself become a target country for illegal migrants who want to stay. </p>
<p>What happened to fair and balanced reporting?</p>

the hordes of illegal immigrants pouring into Europe supplied their own transport ships.</p>

<p>Gallipoli was in 1915. It is interesting to note that while this dreadfull military disaster is very much remembered in Australia &amp; NZ very few people know that one of the reasons for the campaign was in fact to return Constantinople back to Greece.</p>
<p>I assume that Greece, which barely existed as a nation back then, was not in a position to offer much in the way of support at this time. I am unable to find much in the way of military history regarding the Greek involvement in WW1. (The Greek wars of antiquity seem to be better documented!)</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>This can&rsquo;t be a serious problem for Turkey, because:<br>
#1. It is of Turkey&rsquo;s own making, and <br>
#2. Turkey has it within its power to correct it (but doesn&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>Therefore, I do not find that this excuse is credible.</p>

<p>You assume correctly.  The Greeks won their independence from the Ottoman Turks (and their brutal, 400-year long occupation of the Peloponessus) after fighting a particularly nasty war of independence between the years 1821-30.  As with the American Revolutionary War, outside help was required.  The similarities end there.</p>
<p>The Turks heaped numerous atrocities on the rebellious Greeks, who were only happy to reciprocate (&#8220;Brutality invites brutality!&#8221;).  Tens of thousands of Greeks, civilians and rebels alike, were either butchered by the Turks or enslaved by them.  This is not a small figure when you consider the fact the nascent Greek state had a population of less than a million people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/That-Greece-Might-Still-Free/dp/1906924015" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/That-Greece-Might-Still-Free/dp/1906924015</a></p>
<p>The newly independent Greek state was poor due to lack of natural resources, infrastructure and the staggering cost of the war.  Only a small percentage of the population was literate (no doubt thanks to Ottoman misrule).  A subset of this group achieved prosperity by becoming international merchants and shippers.</p>
<p>Though destitute, Greece went to war with the Ottoman Empire in 1897 in a vain attempt to liberate Crete.  Needless to say, the Greeks lost.  Prior to the outbreak of WW1 Greece fought two brief wars in the Balkans, losing and then gaining territories.  When World 1 began King Constantine I of Greece (brother-in-law of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany), fearing an invasion by the mighty British navy, sought to keep Greece neutral, but was eventually undone by his PM Eleftherios Venizelos, who conspired with the UK and France to get Greece in the war by the summer of 1917. </p>
<p>&#8220;I am unable to find much in the way of military history regarding the Greek involvement in WW1. (The Greek wars of antiquity seem to be better documented!)&#8221;</p>
<p>Much has been written which never makes it to the Western reader for simple lack of interest.  Modern Greece (1821-present) is one of those topics that doesn&rsquo;t seen to grab the attention of most members of the &#8220;Barnes and Noble&#8221; crowd.</p>

		<p>To Anon # 15, Thank you for that info.</p>
<p>You also made one important comment &#8220;.. after 400 years of BRUTAL Ottoman occupation ..&#8221; </p>
<p>Yet the EU is almost trying to welcome Turkey with open arms while the rest of the world is bowing down to Islam in all its forms by way of some sort of appeasment. (The same word Chamberlain  used when dealing with Hitler)</p>
<p>Now back to the Greeks, there is one word you do not use in polite Greek company, that is, TURKEY!</p>
<p>An important message for the West here, Learn from history before it is too late!</p>
