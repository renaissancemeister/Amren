<h1>NAACP Sees &#8216;Celebratory&rsquo; Tone in S.C.&rsquo;s Civil War Ceremonies</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wayne Washington, The State (Columbia, South Carolina), January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hot-button political issues, including the commemoration of the Civil War and immigration reform, will be the focus of today&rsquo;s King Day at the Dome march and rally.</p>
<p>At the State House rally, Lonnie Randolph, president of the S.C. state conference of the NAACP, said he will decry what he has described as &#8220;the ongoing celebratory tone that&rsquo;s being taken&#8221; to mark the 150th anniversary of the start of the Civil War.</p>
<p>Another speaker, Wade Henderson, president of the Washington-based Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said he will urge African-Americans to defend the U.S. citizenship of American-born children of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>William Barber, president of the North Carolina state chapter of the NAACP, is scheduled to lead the prayer service. Afterward, there will be a march from Zion Baptist to the steps of the State House, where Randolph will speak, opposing cuts in state health care and education spending and what he sees as the offensive tone of some Civil War anniversary commemorations.</p>
<p>That tone was underscored, Randolph said, by a secession ball that was held last month in Charleston, where guests  &mdash;  including elected officials  &mdash;  dressed up in period costumes, danced and listened to a dramatic reading of the Ordinance of Secession.</p>
<p>The recent re-enactment of a Civil War engagement by cadets from The Citadel also struck Randolph as inappropriately celebratory.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they fired the shots at the Star of the West, they cheered,&#8221; Randolph said of the cadets, who pretended to fire on a Union vessel, as cadets did 150 years ago. &#8220;A military school  &mdash;  a state military school  &mdash;  bragging about trying to overthrow the government? What type of people are we training?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cadets cheered &#8220;Hip-hip hooray!&#8221; after the shots were fired. The State newspaper reported the mood among them was more serious than celebratory.</p>
<p>Still, Randolph said he is concerned that anniversary events could lead to praise for those who fought against the United States in a war to preserve slavery. &#8220;We&rsquo;re still fighting the Civil War here in South Carolina,&#8221; Randolph said. &#8220;South Carolina still wants to secede.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Henderson said he wants to spur African-Americans to defend birthright citizenship. &#8220;Those in the African-American community have seen this kind of attack on citizenship before.&#8221;<br/>

		<p> The very idea, of these White Southerners being proud of their heritage! We must order them into Sensitivity Training, post-haste!</p>
<p> This article and its quotes shows once again how blacks want it &#8220;their way or the highway.&#8221; No one is allowed to disagree with them, on pain of being slammed as &#8220;racist,&#8221; and/or banished to Bogeyland. They like to talk constantly about &#8220;tolerance,&#8221; but they only want it to be applied to them, not to their opponents.</p>

		<p>&#8220;South Carolina NAACP chapter president claims state &ldquo;still wants to secede.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Well, I knew if they complained long enough they&rsquo;d get at least one thing right.  Kind of like a shot gun approach.  One of the pellets is bound to hit something.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure a large number of white South Carolinians would like to form their own sovereign nation if it meant getting rid of blacks.</p>
<p>Of course, getting rid of the free loaders and dead weight aren&rsquo;t the only reasons many states want to secede.  They would like to establish a better democracy than the one in place right now, because this one is dysfunctional and is part of an empire that is slowing sinking in the West.</p>
<p>Blacks just love Calypso Louie.  I don&rsquo;t understand why more of them don&rsquo;t want to form their own sovereign black nation as he does.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because, in spite of their natural arrogance they realize down deep they would deteriorate to a third worlds level in short order as has every other black run government.</p>

<p>Thoughts of secession terrify them. Blacks know everything that they are is dependent on whites. If whites were to separate, blacks know they would dig their own grave.</p>
<p>While they hate the white man, they would hate being without him even more so.<br/>

<p>Preserving slavery was indeed one goal of secession for the Old South&rsquo;s planter class (the cheap labor interests of their day)   &mdash;   especially in the deep South, which includes South Carolina. But this moral blindness was not was not limited to whites.   As Harvard African-American studies professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. reminds us in the New York Times:</p>
<p>&#8220;How did slaves make it to these coastal forts? The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that 90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders. The sad truth is that without complex business partnerships between African elites and European traders and commercial agents, the slave trade to the New World would have been impossible, at least on the scale it occurred.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Anyone else notice how the podium is set up right in front of a covered statue of George Washington?   It could be for TV purposes, but it still seems a little too symbolic for me, especially considering that GW lost his birthday celebration to MLK Jr.</p>
<p>Zoom in with the zoom-in feature on the page.  It zooms in so close one can read the numbers on the guy&rsquo;s VFW cap sitting in front row.</p>
<p>It seems a little disingenuous to me to cover a statue of the father of our country and accuse anyone of anti-Americanism or of trying to rewrite history.   </p>

Say it isn&rsquo;t so!!!!  EVIL white southerners are not solely to blame.    </p>
<p>I am shocked Henry Gates would admit blacks shoulder any responsibility for slavery.  Really puts a kink in that reparations angle.</p>

		<p>Let me know when the state gives blacks 40 acres and a mule (or its current cash equivalent) to leave and then secedes from the union. I know a lot of us will be moving in.</p>

		<p>I could right a book on this subject. I have been studying the War for Southern Independence for years. Of course Slavery was an element in the conflict but a very small one. Historians have tried for years to pin point a single cause and have not been able to do so. The cause was more political and economic than anything.What most people don&rsquo;t realize is that slavery existed in nearly every state when the constitution was ratified. Four slave states remained in the union after the southern secession. When the war ended radical abolitionists took a mission accomplished stance and declared that the free slaves were a southern problem not theirs.Not only that but several northern states enacted black codes to prevent freed slaves from entering their states. Slavery has and always will be a national problemnot just a Southern sin. The bottom line is that the NAACP is<br/>
an anti-white anti-American organization whose time has passed.</p>
<p>If you have any doubts about that here&rsquo;s a link to a slide show on The State&rsquo;s web site.Cycle through them and you&rsquo;ll find a picture of a man standing on the steps of the Zion Baptist Church waving a pan-African flag </p>

		<p>11 John Maddox:</p>
<p>I personally put all my chips into &#8220;irrepressible conflict.&#8221;  There were two different economies, two different elites, two different ways of life, two different economic systems, two different demands for ideal trade policy, and two different attitudes about the need for and desirability of chattel slavery.  Tariffs and slavery were issues, but they were arms of the same octopus, that being two different systems couldn&rsquo;t co-exist in the same national unit, and the northern industrial elite couldn&rsquo;t allow the southern agrarian cash crop elite to have its own independent country because a tariff-free zone and policies of a CSA would have hindered the industrial elite in what remained of the United States.  It is my personal belief that the southern cause was right when it comes to states rights and devolution of power, but the average white person benefited economically in the long run because the victorious northern industrial elites jacked tariffs sky high after the WBTS, building the American industrial and manufacturing base, and that plus the later labor union and organized labor movement meant that the increased national wealth due to the high value added manufacturing would be fairly distributed to industrial employees.  That&rsquo;s why there is (or was) a working middle class in the United States.  </p>
<p>The obvious drawback is that the Union victory also enshrined racial equality as a national raison d&rsquo;etre, as fictional and wrong as it is.  That came back to hurt the average white person in the form of civil rights acts, voting rights acts, affirmative action, and other tragedies, passed a century later.</p>
<p>As an aside, the untold story about slavery is that it was most deleterious to the non-elite whites in slave states.  Since there was all this free labor available, there was not a need for antebellum Southern society to develop a viable bourgeiose middle class of professional artisans.  This meant that Southerners were almost rigidly in one of three categories:  (1) Elite whites who were or closely linked to agrarian wealth, (2) Non-elite whites (most whites) who eked out an existence in one way or another, and (3) Black slaves.  Cheap labor hurts the middle classes.  We&rsquo;re having the same debate again, only animated by mass Chicano immigration.</p>
