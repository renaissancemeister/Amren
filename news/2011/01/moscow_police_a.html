<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20110111/EU.Russia.Ethnic.Tensions/">Moscow Police Arrest Dozens to Avert Racist Riots</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sergei Fedotov, Comcast News, January 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Russian police on Tuesday arrested dozens of people suspected of planning a racist rally near the Kremlin walls, as authorities looked to avert a repeat of last month&rsquo;s riots by ultra-nationalists who objected to the presence of non-Slavs in the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At least 30 police trucks lined up on Manezh Square in response to internet threats by ultra-nationalists to repeat the Dec. 11 riots, in which 5,000 people chanted &#8220;Russia for Russians&#8221; and beat dark-skinned passers-by. The riots were a reaction to the killing of a white Russian soccer fan during a fight with people from the south of the country. The violence left more than 30 people wounded and raised doubts about the government&rsquo;s ability to stem a rising tide of xenophobia. Days later, police detained 800 people in the capital and other cities to prevent further violence.</p>
<p>An Associated Press television crew saw at least 20 people taken to police vans Tuesday after a police document check, including one person wearing clothes bearing the initials of a well-known nationalist organization, the Movement Against Illegal Immigration. Russian news agencies said up to 100 people were detained.</p>
<p>Kremlin critics accuse the authorities of fomenting social disorder to justify a crackdown on the opposition before presidential elections in 2012. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While ethnic Russians make up four-fifths of Russia&rsquo;s population of 142 million, the country is also home to about 180 ethnic groups. The Caucasus region, with its mountainous terrain and isolated valleys, hosts at least 100 ethnicities including Chechens, who have waged two separatist wars since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.<br>

		<p>The only thing wrong with multiculturalism is, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>The old Soviet Union was the poster child for multiculturalism, and it was pulled apart like taffy, in the end. The current Russian ethnic makeup is around 80%, or 114 million out of 142 million. And STILL they have problems.</p>
<p>Chanting &#8220;Russia for Russians&#8221;, is hardly &#8220;racism&#8221;. I&rsquo;m beginning to think that those who most loudly and frequently employ terms like &#8220;racism&#8221;, are precisely the ones who cannot define their own pet terminology.</p>
<p>Kind of like baseball pitchers and the term &#8220;velocity&#8221;. During the 1970&rsquo;s, the term was much in vogue in clubhouses throughout the sport, and still is. Pitchers would say how they were throwing the ball with greater &#8220;velocity&#8221; or more &#8220;consistent velocity&#8221;. Yet, probably not one in a hundred baseball pitchers can give you a definition of the term &#8220;velocity&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Once again, a case of a white &#8216;government&rsquo; taking sides against it&rsquo;s own people and favoring no-whites. It seems these so called governments feel it is there sacred duty to destroy any white pride or nationalism. What is so wrong about having Russia for Russians or Germany for Germans or any other white country wanting to protect and preserve it&rsquo;s whiteness and uniqueness? Don&rsquo;t these traitors realize that they are the caretakers of thousands of years of European history and culture and not the masters of it? They have no right whatsoever to destroy in a few decades what our forefathers bled and died for over hundreds of years. </p>

		<p>Note to awakened Whites:</p>
<p>Russia is full of racially-conscious Whites because of what was done to them under  Communism.</p>
<p>Putin is NOT an enemy to Whites.  The lamestream media demonizes him because he cracked down on the &#8220;Oligarchs&#8221;  &mdash;   thieves that raped billions from Mother Russia.  Those who criticize Putin as anti-White must realize he is playing both sides, he has to deal with outside problems around Russia before he can do anything internally.  Trust me, Putin is pro-White.</p>
<p>Russia and Putin are our FRIENDS not enemies.  Don&rsquo;t believe the slander.</p>

		<p>There is so much wrong and deceitful with this that I almost don&rsquo;t know where to start.</p>
<p>First, in 2001, the foreign population percentage of Russia represented 1.9%, in 2005 it was at 8.4%.  That is a HUGE stress to induce on any population, let alone a formerly homogenous one that was slowly recovering from wartime losses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.migrationinformation.org/datahub/countrydata.cfm?ID=525" rel="nofollow">https://www.migrationinformation.org/datahub/countrydata.cfm?ID=525</a></p>
<p>And all largely due to a _propaganda engineered_ (no money for internal economic growth = restrictive white birthrates, heavily overreported as &#8216;population slump&rsquo;) crisis.  No matter where the money went, why or to whom, the reality is that population change was just too convenient an excuse to undermine the political base of a popular Russian leadership.  And given time, it will do exactly that, just as it has here.</p>
<p>And the socio-engineering is obvious in the demographics of popultion change as approximately 30% (15+7+7) is from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Armenia.  Which is to say a huge percentage of Islamic Asiatics.</p>
<p>Another _35%_ is from &#8216;other countries&rsquo; which undoubtedly includes Blacks, Indians and others so poor that Russia looks like a good destination (second only to Canada in terms of immigrant arrivals I believe).  And with whom whites would not willingly interbreed.  &#8216;If only they knew&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Only 22% of this human sea change are from white Ukraine and even they don&rsquo;t match the white flight outpouring to Latvia/Lithuania/Estonia and Europe beyond.</p>
<p>It should also be said that the Caucasus are nothing to the Urals and both together are not simply periphery niche` environments that shelter population groups like Russia was some kind of giant Galapagos experiment by Darwin.</p>
<p>Rather they are more properly understood as the true HARD BOUNDARY between primitive Siberian (Asian and Middle Eastern) and advanced European (White) cultures.</p>
<p>Indeed, the original term &#8216;Rus&rsquo; (Rootsi, Ruotsi, Roslagen = Sweden) was the local word for the Varangian (Viking) culture that held hegemony over the entire area from the Baltic States to Moscow to Kiev in the time before the early Tsarist houses.  </p>
<p>Callled &#8216;pirated&rsquo; by history, they in fact established law and order, were effective traders and generally kept the peace between warring tribes and as soon as they managed to created effective governments were kicked out for their troubles.  Only to be begged back about a generation and a half later because the locals realized they were right back where they started and couldn&rsquo;t keep from ripping each other to shreds without a little friendly oversight.</p>
<p>These Rus are the source of the blonde haired, blue eyed, &#8216;slavic&rsquo;, Russians you still see occasionally today.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they are also the people Hitler soundly thrashed in the first six months of WWII.  So that they had to make peace with Japan and then conscript a veritable horde of Siberian Asians to continue the war after October 1941 and the last fights outside Vyazma (which saw the encirclement and capture of four Russian field armies numbering almost 700,000 men) effectively reduced European Russians to about 90,000 men for the defense of Moscow a month later.</p>
<p>These were Asians whom the Tsars had spent entire generations of wealth subjugating and indeed, only defeated because the Russians had some of the earliest modern field armies with cannon and rifles and Siberia some of the lousiest road/information networks in existence.  The typical joke being: &#8220;The Tsars are gone?  Who were the Tsars?&#8221;<br>
The Asians themselves were defeated by the Wehrmacht in about 4 successive waves before succumbing on the fifth, outside of Kursk/Kharkov.  These are truly fierce warriors of the type who would steal a light bulb thinking it was &#8216;magic&rsquo; and would surely cast light if only they could bring it back home to the yert.  These are the men who engaged in ritual cannibalism of living German victims, even when they had full logistic support from their masters, in Russia&rsquo;s summer.  These are the people whom the Germans found to be so bereft of basic human dignity as sanitary behavior that they were not worth a train trip to serve as labor in the Reich.</p>
<p>These are the men whom the Russians promptly sent directly back to where they came from, with all alacrity, after the war while looking for replacements (and you thought &#8216;being sent east&rsquo; was purely a punitive measure imposed on Eastern Europeans and Germans?  No, it was a dire need for population replenishment for the Russians&rsquo; terrible wartime losses which are now thought to have been DOUBLE what was admitted as 25 million&hellip;) for their shattered economy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only fair to assume that the Russians do indeed know of whom they are speaking, from centuries of direct experience, when they say &#8216;Russia for the Russians!&rsquo;.  And we should not be in the business of saying otherwise as a function of globalization, IMF debt or current PC social fashion.</p>
<p>What this sounds like to me is Psyops Judo.  You invite someone to take a first step with infiltration (probably the guy with the name tag jacket) and then you use his inducing motions on the full group to throw them all down on inertial stupidity of commitment.</p>
<p>In this, Russians could stand to learn a few things from how the FBI infiltrated the various Civil Rights organizations.  Don&rsquo;t let an initial victory at a Protest Rally for a murdered youth spur you into thinking you have the cops on the run so that you are -encouraged- to show up a week later at a train station &#8216;armed and ready&rsquo;.  As a perfect excuse for your own arrest.</p>
<p>Watch &#8216;The 13th Warrior&rsquo; and THINK, before you act.  It is always what you don&rsquo;t see that you have to calculate.  That is the Rus that you must awaken within and be loyal to.</p>

		<p>I have faith that White people in America will survive for quite some time. But if I had to place a bet on which -Nation-, America or Russia, will be around in the year 2100, I would have to bet on Russia.  It may end up being smaller in terms of square miles than it is today, but there will still be a Russian Nation.</p>

<p>What are you talking about? Blondism and blue eyes are geographical traits found all across northern europe in Germanic, Finno-Ugric, and Slavic populations. A result of evolution through climate adaption, not &#8220;Rus admixture&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are just as many natural blonde Slavs as there are Germanics, their physical differences lie in facial structure, not coloring.</p>

<p>  After the fall of communism, I never considered Russia a hostile power. In fact, Russia may remain the last best hope for white nationalists everywhere. <br>
