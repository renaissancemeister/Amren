<h1>Texas Leadership Announced to Mobilize Against Anti-Hispanic Laws</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, Somos Republicans, January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MEDIA ADVISORY</p>
<p>National Hispanic Group Announces Texas Leadership</p>
<p>For Immediate Release<br>
17 January 2011<br>
Texas Contact: 281.236.8294<br>
National Contact: 480.200.3748</p>
<p>Houston, TX   &mdash;  SOMOS REPUBLICANS is the largest conservative Hispanic Republican grassroots organization in the country committed to promoting positive, principled conservative solutions that confront our community and the nation today. Our mission is to inspire Hispanics based on our core principles: Limited Government, Right to Life, Free Market Capitalism, Low Taxes, Second Amendment Rights and Complete Legal Immigration Overhaul to join us in every state throughout the nation to change the direction of the country on behalf of Hispanics.</p>
<p>We realize the great state of Texas has just elected Republicans to the state legislature by an overwhelming majority and we are excited the opportunity this affords the governor and the legislature to truly represent the largest and fastest growing community in Texas: Hispanic conservatives.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Inaugural events that offers an exciting promise and opens new pathways for conservative Hispanic Republicans, we are proud to announce our dedicated Texas State Directors: Lauro Garza and Sam Rodriguez from Houston, and Alejandro Torrealba from Dallas/Ft. Worth. Our Texas team has been working hard, planning and organizing for several months to provide the voting public reasonable, rational and principled solutions to any federal legislation and Texas state bills that negatively impact the immigrant and the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>SOMOS REPUBLICANS will make a concerted effort to work to counter those who introduce any anti-Hispanic laws by offering reasonable legislation for consideration and taking to task any group or individual that demonizes or uses &#8220;spiteful political rhetoric&#8221; against the Hispanic community to promote their political standing or cause.</p>
<p>We are the first group in the United States that issued a report card that analyzes  Hispanic related issues and their impact on the Constitution, the pro family agenda, the pro life agenda, and any topic related to immigration.  In fact, SOMOS retracted its support to Rep. Dan Patrick recently when it was discovered that he is advocating legislation similar to Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070. We believe that a passive approach Hispanic Republicans have taken to date has been ineffective as we witness an onslaught of anti-immigrant laws proposed in many states but have not yet cleared federal court systems. Passiveness no longer works, and we know there is no choice but to responsibly right the wrongs of those attempting to undermine the US Constitution. We will work with all Republicans, Democrats and Independents who are against any attack against the Hispanic community as we continue to expose legislators who unjustly demonize the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>We will hold legislators like Leo Berman, Dan Flynn Debbie Riddle and Dan Patrick accountable in 2012 as we mobilize and educate Hispanics in the areas they represent.  We can no longer stand idly by and watch our elected officials use Hispanics and the immigration issue in a way that rallies a small base that wishes to prevent Hispanics from participating in all constitutional guarantees this nation has to offer. We are growing, mobilizing, paying attention, and a keeping a score card for 2012.</p>
<p>MEET THE TEXAS STATE DIRECTORS</p>
<p>Lauro Garza is a proud Catholic college educated professional with 25 years in law enforcement and has worked as an investigator. Currently, he produces Conservative Latino Talk Radio, with considerable growing Latino outreach in the Hispanic community. He is our Texas tenacious, watch dog that uses the airwaves to discuss the legislators and the bills they introduce that impact the Hispanic community and at their core are unconstitutional.  Lauro will soon be the most listened to Hispanic Conservative Talk Radio show host in the nation as he expands his listening group, increases his circle of influence and continues to fearlessly tackle controversial individuals and issues.</p>
<p>Sam Rodriguez has been involved with Texas Republican politics and has been instrumental in 2010 Republican campaigns. As a member of the Evangelical community he is a strong pro life supporter and believes in the fair and equal treatment of fellow man.</p>
<p>Alejandro Torrealba is our leader in Dallas / Ft. Worth. . He is a teacher who believes that his purpose in life is to foster the intellectual and social development of his students, and make a positive impact in the Hispanic community. He is inspired by education and is called to share this inspiration through public service.  His mission has led him to work specifically with low- income students in the poorest areas in the Dallas, Metroplex. He believes that with high-quality education any child in America can achieve his/her dreams. As a former minister of Central America, he naturally works well with the Evangelical community and keeps them informed regarding Hispanic friendly politicians and legislation.</p>
<p>We are developing and mobilizing in San Antonio, Austin, South Texas and West Texas, and we look forward to introducing those leaders to Tejanos and DREAM Act activists next month.</p>
<p>Texas Director: Lauro Garza<br>

Dallas/Ft. Worth Director: Alejandro Torrealba</p>

		<p>Sounds like the type of George Bush, Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, John McCain GOP that made me leave the Stupid Party years ago. The Republicans might as well accept anti-white groups like Somos Republicans as they certainly don&rsquo;t do anything for white people.</p>
<p>But the brown power group should pick a more honest name like Somos La Raza.</p>

		<p>If you look at their web site they are almost certainly a leftist front group. All they do is talk about the need for open borders and how racist Republicans are (well - at least white Republicans).</p>
<p>No talk of taxes, foreign policy, the environment, campaign finance reform or even economic growth. They are only interested in Hispanic issues.</p>
<p>Really different from Hispanics Democrats, huh?</p>

<p>Adios, SOMOS. If the Republican Party is EVER to lead again, it must get rid of Fifth Columnists like this. </p>
<p>These SOMOS guys may well be sincere in their statements about limited govt, lower taxes, etc. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter, because their relentless emphasis on their Raza reveals them to be Hispanic first and Republican second. </p>

		<p>The letter writer above seems like an intellegent person, yet we have another example of someone who can&rsquo;t comprehend the difference between anti-Hispanic and anti-ILLEGAL It&rsquo;s true that most illegals are Hispanic, but if they are here legally - no problem. But if you approve of the illegal invasion you might as well say, &#8220;we approve of their breaking into the country, we approve of the many crimes they commit, we approve of the drain on our economic and natural resources, our overcrowded schools, hospital emergency rooms, prisons,and we approve of their total disregard of our laws. Oh, we also approve of the fact that our people here must compete with illegals for jobs. What a shame, but blood is always thicker than water. Well, let&rsquo;s be ready. Get your representatives on the phone. Email and fax them and let them know that we expect them to stand up for Americans. Even the Republican should refute any organization who can&rsquo;t decide if they are Americans. </p>

		<p>Are they really conservatives or just more leftinos in drag? Whatever they are, it&rsquo;s obvious they put hispanics first in everything they do. Will the GOP denounce them as racist? Would the GOP accept an equivalent group of white Republicans? Is anyone else tired of the GOP defecating on whites while pandering to others?</p>

		<p>Pro- immigration reform is another term for open the gates. These &#8220;conservative&#8221; republican mestizos have everything in common with every other &#8220;hispanic group&#8221; Get more mestizos in the U.S. It&rsquo;s time the republicans and independents started voting and advocating their interests. Hopefully the new congress will begin to reform the immigration system the way it should be reformed. Identify, arrest, and deport illegal aliens, mestizo, asian, whatever. Secure the border and severely limit all immigration for at least 10 years. </p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound very &#8220;Republican&#8221; to me.  They sound more like neoc-on libertarians, with a heavily Hispanic agenda.  How can they oppose SB1070-type legislation, when roughly 60-70% of ALL Americans (including Democrats) support it?  That just proves they don&rsquo;t care about anything except bringing more of their own kind to America.</p>
