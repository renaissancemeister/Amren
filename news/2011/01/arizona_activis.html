<h1>Arizona Activists Fight Anti-Immigrant Climate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News Latino, December 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A new group of activists intends to combat the sentiment in Arizona given the fear that in 2011 it will increase with bills like the ones being prepared by Republican state lawmaker Russell Pearce.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re a group of citizens concerned about the stance that Pearce could take starting in January now that he&rsquo;s the leader of the majority in the state senate,&#8221; Randy Parraz, the organizer for Citizens for a Better Arizona, told Efe on Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pearce, 63, has been the driving force behind several of the harshest state laws against illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pearce also has been the main impetus behind several state laws like the one that prohibits granting driver&rsquo;s licenses to people who do not have a Social Security Number and another that denies public assistance to undocumented people along with the right to bail when arrested, among others.</p>
<p>The lawmaker said that as soon as the next legislative session begins in January he will present a state bill that seeks to reform the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which grants U.S. citizenship to any person born in U.S. territory without regard to the immigration status of his or her parents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re very concerned that this person (Pearce) does not have the ability to represent the values and the ideals that are best for Arizona,&#8221; said Parraz, who also is organizing a second group named the East Valley Patriots for American Values, which will monitor the actions undertaken by Pearce, in particular, within the district he represents in Mesa.</p>
<p>Parraz is organizing an event on January 10 at the state capitol, where it is expected that more than 200 people will gather to present a document to Pearce in which they express their concern over his actions.</p>
<p>The activist, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination to challenge Sen. John McCain, said that if Pearce keeps his word and continues pushing anti-immigrant bills they are ready to begin a campaign to collect signatures to recall him.</p>

The headline is of course wrong.</p>
<p>It should read, &#8220;Arizona Activits Fight Anti-ILLEGAL-&#8220;Immigrant&#8221; Climate&#8221;.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t anti-immigrant. They&rsquo;re anti-CRIMINAL ALIEN. </p>

		<p>Well Mr. Parraz, organize and protest all you want, but the fact is White America is waking up and the majority of us don&rsquo;t want you here. Just look at the comments from this article alone.  I see the same EVERYWHERE on the net when the issue of illegal immigration comes up. We are sick and tired of you people and your whinning and complaining and bankrupting our states one by one. It&rsquo;s past time to kick every single one of you parasites back across the border and dare you to try to come back. I believe it will come to that sooner or later, because this Nation is dying and I have hope that it can be saved before a total collapse, which will only happen when racial lines are finally drawn.</p>

		<p>Arizona is shaping up to be ground zero in the battle to stop the invasion of our country. Already the enemy has stated their intentions and claimed that if they cannot get what they want through activism, they will resort to force. Americans better wake up and fast.</p>

		<p>Randy Parraz is already being assisted by our liberal media, as #1.sbuffalonative pointed out the misleading headline.</p>
<p>And also misleading is the name of his group, &#8220;Citizens for a Better Arizona&#8221;. The problem that Russell Pearce has to address has nothing to do with the &#8220;citizens&#8221; of Arizona but the hordes of illegal immigrants that has damaged his state and the people who are there legally, its citizens.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that the way enemies of a state operate? Twist, distort, deny and suppress the truth at every opportunity? People who may still be under the brainwashing inflicted en masse may be sucked in, but more and more, with gaining speed, people are waking up. The sleeping giant is starting to awake. You can&rsquo;t intimidate us with threats of violence, we know this is a fight for the sovereignty of our states, our very country. The citizens of our country have sent out a loud, clear message. If you are here illegally, GET OUT! We can neither afford or tolerate it anymore.  </p>

		<p> There is a reason for the goverments blindness towards the illegals. They are counting on them to shore up social security. The thing is that they are going to be demanding their share of social security in due time so the ponzi scheme will collapse whether they are here or not. I&rsquo;d prefer to take the hit myself and not leave it for my children. Our culture is worth more than a piddling check.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just whites, but there are a lot of blacks and asians that resent them being here.  There are lots of people of all ethnicities that came here legally that resent them being here.  Not that either of those groups share our interests at heart, but they see massive hispanic immigration as a threat to their race as well.</p>

<p>No, that&rsquo;s the EXCUSE the elites give for the &#8220;need&#8221; for these illegal immigrants, and for amnesty toward them.  It has nothing to do with making social security solvent, and everything to do with flooding our country with new Democrats - enough to keep the liberals in power over whites forever.  As to social security - we have allowed ourselves to be persuaded social security be abandoned as bankrupt - another goal of the elites.<br>
Social Security would NOT be bankrupt if the politicians had NOT raided it for 40 years for programs they could not get funded through legislation.  It would NOT be bankrupt if it had not been used as a scholarship fund for black kids whose father died (usually from violent crime) so the son could go to college.  It would NOT be bankrupt if it had been used for it&rsquo;s sole purpose - retirement for those who were FORCED to pay in to it for the last 50 years, and ONLY for that.  Please remember, many, many WHITES were FORCED to pay in to social security, and many of those Whites had NO OTHER retirement fund offered to them.  In many cases that was the only retirement fund the company provided them, and the only one they could afford since so much of their paycheck went into it by LAW.  The illegals do not intend paying in to SS.  If amnestied, they will vote (against White America) but they will STILL work off the books, still send money home to Mexico, still invade illegally, still take every welfare benefit they can.  Folks, remember this please.  Social Security was payed IN TO by working Whites.  As was medicare.  Welfare and Medicaid (the programs for non-working blacks and minorities) was NEVER payed in to by anybody but WORKING WHITES.  We should NOT let the government now renege on it&rsquo;s promise to the largely WHITE ELDERLY.  Especially we should forcefully reject Obama&rsquo;s plan to TAKE from Social Security and Medicare and give even MORE to the blacks through Welfare and Medicaid.  Social Security was a ponzi scheme - but it went bankrupt because it was stolen by politicians for minority programs over the last 50 years, NOT because we elderly Whites payed too little in.  A vote to abandon Social Security now is a vote to betray your WHITE elderly, and give the politicians exactly what they want - to skate away from their criminal liability and to further dispossess WHITES.  There is a reason talk of abandoning social security occurs at the same time our elites advocate for euthenasia and &#8220;end of life&#8221; counseling for WHITE ELDERLY.  AS THE HISPANICS ARE FOND OF SAYING - THEY WANT US ALL TO DIE.   We remember best what this country was and what has been lost.  We vote most often against socialism.  We vote most often for traditional values.  If they can get us to die from neglect that much quicker, and gain amnesty soon, YOUR COUNTRY IS LOST FOREVER.  Get it?  Finally?  I hope you do.</p>

		<p>Patthemick, Social Security requires alot of high income people to pay into the system to keep it afloat, not a bunch of minimum wage Mexicans and many of these people work under the table for cash anyhow and don&rsquo;t pay into it.  I think the real reason these people are here is to suppress the wages of the poor and working class people in this country while corporations reap the windfalls of cheap labor at pennies on the dollar.  Amnesty would also provide a large pool of government dependent voters who can maintain a one party system and marginalize White voters.  </p>
