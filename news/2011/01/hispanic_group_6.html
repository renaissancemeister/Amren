			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>JoAnne Young, Lincoln Journal Star (Nebraska), January 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A fledgling Hispanic Republican group is criticizing a Nebraska state senator for his use of the term &#8220;anchor babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somos Republicans, which describes itself as a growing grassroots organization, is demanding an apology from Sen. Charlie Janssen of Fremont for using what leaders of the group say is a defamatory term, akin to other such terms used to describe people belonging to minority groups.</p>
<p>Bob Quasius, Midwest director of the group, said Janssen was being insensitive.</p>
<p>&#8220;His actions are reprehensible,&#8221; Quasius said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Senator Janssen] said the group could call and ask for an apology but &#8220;they&rsquo;re not going to get one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The senator said he was looking seriously with others at legislation that deals with the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says: All persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens of the United States and of the state where they reside.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In reply to Somos Republicans criticism, he said he took exception to undocumented mothers who endanger their unborn and other children in how they illegally enter the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The organization [Somos Republicans] is made up of Republicans, and members adhere to the party&rsquo;s core values and positions, he said, but they want to see federal immigration policies reformed.<br>

		<p>As noted recently at vdare, USCIS (immigration) documents refer neutrally to &#8220;anchor relatives.&#8221; It really is no big deal, unless you are a thought-control thug who wants to regulate free &amp; accurate speech.  </p>

		<p>I believe Fremont, NE is the city that introduced a strict enforcement policy on illegal immigrants last year.  Either way, let&rsquo;s hope the State Sen. doesn&rsquo;t grovel.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re right of course, &#8220;Anchor Baby&#8221; is not a proper term.  But it is easier to say than &#8220;Grappling Hook Baby&#8221; which is what they are in terms of function.  These are not &#8220;loved&#8221; children, they are instruments of abuse by illegal aliens.  Some choose to stuff drugs into the baby and make their money that way.  Some choose to have the baby inside America and use it and others likely to follow for government aid leverage.  It&rsquo;s amazing to me all the bleeding hearts ignore this basic side of the problem; the children.  Just because they&rsquo;re in America doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re going to be treated any better than kids in Mexico.<br>

		<p>This Hispanic group who objects to the phrase Anchor Baby is full of it. If you go to the LaRaza militant web page, which another poster on AmRen in the last five months provided, they had a cartoonish picture of a cute little Mexican baby sitting on an anchor, urging and promoting the Hispanics to procreate on U.S. soil in order to gain citizenship. NOW they find it offensive? Absolutely not. What they find offensive is that the DREAM ACT was overturned.</p>
<p>I tried to find that post again so I could include that site here, but could not. An attempt to show Sen. Charlie Janssen in a bad light is all this is. A lot of smoke and mirrors. They say his actions are &#8220;reprehensible&#8221;. They are the reprehensible ones-encouraging illegal immigrants to breed some more children they can&rsquo;t afford here in our country. By overturning the DREAM ACT we sent them a loud clear message-we can no longer afford to keep supporting your children you so mindlessly spawn with free government handouts. We are tired of having to compete with illegals for jobs in our own country. </p>
<p>And I commend  Sen. Janssen for refusing to give an apology and not pandering to this blackmailing group who support these illegal criminals.</p>

		<p>Oh, give me a break.  Somos Republicans are as &#8220;conservative&#8221; as Log Cabin Republicans.  If they don&rsquo;t like the term anchor baby, then they can stay south of the border and have their babies in MEXICO.  Better yet, clarify the 14th Amendment with legislation that gives US citizenship only to children born to parents (both of them) who are US citizens in their own right.  By birth or naturalization.  Then we won&rsquo;t need the term anchor baby anymore.  </p>

		<p>But I thought inducting hispanics into the Republican<br>
Party was suppose to create harmony..not more division, <br>
not more thought control, not more white exploitation.<br>
How could this be? You mean race transcends everything?<br>
Will Jared provide free 1 year subscriptions to all white Republicans..and give them a chance to realize that<br>
Diversity isnt strength..its chaos?</p>

<p><br>
What&rsquo;s &#8220;reprehensible&#8221; is that we have millions of illegal invaders, violating our sovereignty and then pumping out as many anchor babies as humanly possible, in order to usurp money,as well as insulate themselves from deportation, (as well as US citizenship) and then become incensed when Americans demand an end to this exploitation!!<br>
That&rsquo;s &#8220;reprehensible&#8221;!<br>

		<p>Seems the Hispanics are getting as testy as the Muslims about<br>
terms. Okay, how about &#8220;babies who were born after their parents broke into this country in order to have a tie to the great American giveaway?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8216;No credible study shows women come here illegally to have babies in an effort to help them establish citizenship, he said. If the parents entered the country illegally, they would have to go back and wait 10 years before applying to come in legally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Graham is right on that point. According to a report by the Pew Hispanic Center, a think tank that has done extensive research on immigration policy, 3.8 million undocumented immigrants have at least one child who is a citizen. &#8220;Most children of unauthorized immigrants   &mdash;   73 percent in 2008   &mdash;   are U.S. citizens by birth,&#8221; the center says. That&rsquo;s up from 63 percent in 2003.</p>
<p>These statistics suggest not only that the number is large, but is also growing.<br>
&gt;</p>

<p>Tell me lies, tell me sweet little brown lies.</p>
<p>DREAM is/was not simply a means to bypass the back-of-line penalties for illegal border hopping, it is part of a PLANNED strategy to have the kids and then (21 years later), upon declaration of the defacto amnesty, instantly render them able to &#8216;sponsor&rsquo; their parents, siblings, aunts and uncles.</p>
<p>Not to mention the huge holes in the act which effectively render it possible to skip college and/or service altogether.</p>
<p>Probably the worst thing whites do is consider these people pathetic and pitiable.  _Everything_ they try to set up has a specific, 1-2-3, sequential and progressive impetus towards Mexican Homeland dominance in mind.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever think that it&rsquo;s innocent.  Don&rsquo;t ever think it&rsquo;s done in isolation.  These people DO think &#8216;long term&rsquo;.  It is American Whites, by dint of being called xenophobic and paranoid, who are being encouraged to fixate on the present and ignore the future threat.</p>

		<p>I am a legal hispanic and am sick and tired of people coming into this country and start trying to change it. If words we use offend you, then go back to where you came from. We do not want you here! Americans made this a great country not you, so quit crying. Even my dog knows not to bite the hand that feeds it.</p>
