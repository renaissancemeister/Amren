			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Riccardi, Los Angeles Times, January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pearce [Senate President Russell Pearce], 63, is arguably the most powerful man in Arizona politics. And his conservative, populist style  &mdash;  which his allies call principled and determined and which his enemies brand as divisive and dangerous  &mdash;  is at the heart of the current debate over the tone of politics.</p>
<p>The man charged in the attack, 22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner, has shown no sign of being influenced by Pearce or by the rightward drift of Arizona. But the shooting has led pundits and elected officials, including President Obama, to call for greater civility in public life.</p>
<p>In Arizona, that call has often been interpreted as an attempt to rein in Pearce, who sometimes refers to those who disagree with his immigration stance as &#8220;traitors.&#8221; He himself has received so much vitriol and so many threats that state police proposed guarding him last year. The former lawman turned them down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s just unstoppable,&#8221; said former state Rep. Bill Konopnicki, a fellow Republican and longtime target of Pearce. &#8220;He is willing to do whatever it takes to change the world because he thinks he has some divine calling.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pearce&rsquo;s Legislature is expected to continue to take aggressive steps in the coming weeks. One of the first bills of the session would allow concealed guns on college campuses. Other expected legislation would designate second-class citizenship for children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants and create a volunteer militia to patrol the Mexican border.</p>
<p>&#8220;He talks the people&rsquo;s language, he pushes the people&rsquo;s bills and he&rsquo;s blunt  &mdash;  and I think that&rsquo;s refreshing to people,&#8221; said state Rep. John Kavanagh, a fellow Republican.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pearce is a fifth-generation Arizonan in a state of newcomers. He grew up in a troubled home with a severely alcoholic father.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pearce attended lectures by W. Cleon Skousen, a right-wing author and former FBI agent whose controversial theories have also inspired Glenn Beck.</p>
<p>Skousen argued that the United States was divinely founded and that breaching the country&rsquo;s law contradicted God&rsquo;s will. Like Pearce, Skousen was Mormon. Traces of Skousen can be heard in Pearce&rsquo;s stark, black-and-white style and his emphasis on the sanctity of the law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2004, he [Pearce] wrote a ballot measure denying state services to illegal immigrants and requiring picture identification to vote, which passed easily.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pearce&rsquo;s opponents accuse him of racism. Some tie him to white supremacist groups  &mdash;  he once approvingly forwarded an e-mail from one such organization, and shared the stage with a local neo-Nazi at an immigration rally in 2007. Pearce, who has Latino grandchildren, has said he wasn&rsquo;t aware of all the views of the racist groups involved in each incident.</p>
<p>His allies say the racism accusation is a smear from liberals. &#8220;What he stands for is against everything they&rsquo;re trying to accomplish,&#8221; said Michelle Dallacroce, an anti-illegal-immigration activist.</p>
<p>Pearce came to national attention last year with SB 1070, which would require police to investigate the immigration status of people they have detained.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
conservative activists in November.</p>
<p>Bruce Merrill, a longtime pollster and emeritus professor of political science at Arizona State University, said that although some of Pearce&rsquo;s immigration stands had been popular, his brand of conservatism was favored only by about 20% of the state. But Merrill noted that a tiny minority of the state votes in the primaries that control who wins elective office.</p>

		<p>I listened to Russ Pearce speak when he was here in DC<br>
for the Supreme Court review of AB1070. The first thing<br>
that impressed me was that, here, was a man who could<br>
not be pushed around, and who was immune to the drivel<br>
and lies of the age. I expected a Arizona sheriff of<br>
few words, instead I heard a first rate legal mind that<br>
knew the Constitution as a whole. He cited Amendment 10<br>
&#8220;all powers not expressly given to the Federal Government<br>
are reverved for the states, or the people&#8221; as the foundation<br>
for what he is doing. The Federal Government was created by the<br>
States..not the other way around. He went on to describe how<br>
the 14th Amendment has not been &#8220;misinterpreted&#8221; to mean<br>
birthright citizenship for foreigners there is nothing to &#8220;misinterpret&#8221;. Once again the Constitution has been<br>
made a mockery of in the name of Marxist &#8220;progress&#8221;.In short Pearce has done more for the long term survival and sanity of the USA than the past 5 Presidents put together. Shaking his hand at the end of of the talk I noticed the fingers on his right hand were missing..shot off by an illegal alien he was trying to arrest while preserving the territorial sovreignty of the USA..the same sovreignty our elected officials have done so much to destroy.  Put Russell Pearce up on Mount Rushmore next to Teddy Roosevelt and Thomas Jefferson. He has a good deal of both men in his own character. Hats off  to you Russ..and thank you.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about Russell Pearce before reading this article.</p>
<p>Good for Russell, I&rsquo;ll be supporting him in the future. Nice to discover there are some public officials with this kind of courage and belief system still left in the country. </p>

		<p>I actually met Russel Pearce at a college function; he was very easy to talk to, and loves to talk to people about what is going on in their neighborhood. When I started to talk about all the issues I had learned about on Amren (I didn&rsquo;t say where I did my learning, since I didn&rsquo;t want anyone to overhear, and risk one of my Marxist classmates leaking to the visting press that Russel Pearce had ties to &#8220;racist publications&#8221;) Pearce said that he was very impressed with my knowledge of current events and Arizona politics. I know that he didn&rsquo;t say anything like that to anyone else in my class, because afterward we discussed the politicians, and I was the only one to get praise from Russel Pearce.</p>

		<p>Russell Pearce does exactly what the voters of AZ want, using all available legislative tools to battle out of control illegal (that illegal folks, easy to understand) immigration.  He has been reelected for many years because he is effective and he goes about his business despite the whining of Bruce Merrill and the extreme left.<br>
Consider the source and ignore their howls, when the criticism comes from the wet backs that write for the LA Times and left wing academics. <br>

		<p>Pearce is simply a patriot who loves his country and state and hates to see where it&rsquo;s headed. If every state had a Russell Pearce we&rsquo;d have a much better country. It&rsquo;s truly a shame when a man who simply wants his state populated by legal, law abiding residents is called a &#8220;hater&#8221; and worse. I say God bless Pearce. Millions love him and his aims. </p>

<p>WOW! There&rsquo;s a loaded phrase if ever I heard one! This article was doing pretty well up until this point. Anything can be phrased in such a way as to make it sound repellant or extreme. As usual, an MSM writer just can help letting his personal and institutional bias enter into his article. Very tacky.</p>

		<p>God bless him for trying. Its rare we don&rsquo;t have to drag politicians kicking, and screaming to get them to take baby steps in the direction most of the people want them to go, much less a politician willing to do it on their own accord. </p>
<p>Someone with a similar platform would do quite well in my district in Missouri were they able to get their views across without the media distorting them beyond recognition. </p>

		<p>There is a good reason that the cultural Marxists push their &#8220;no platform for &#8220;racists (i.e., whites)&#8221; agenda, they cannot compete in honest debate. The more that white people stick out their chests and speak up, the more the &#8220;progressives&#8221; reveal their seething hatred and resort to escalating violence and ham-handed repression. The Beast shows its true face when provoked&hellip;and there is only so much of their nastiness awakening Americans will tolerate.    </p>

Aside from losing a few fingers, Russell Pierce almost lost one of his sons. Sean Pearce, in the line of duty, was shot by an illegal alien and critically wounded. He was, and still is, in law enforcement. This is not usually known, but I recalled hearing it mentioned and checked on it. Sure enough, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
