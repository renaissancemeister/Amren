			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julian Ryall, Telegraph (London), January 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Japan&rsquo;s birth rate stands at 1.21 per family, far below the rate of 2.08 babies that is required for a stable population.</p>
<p>As of March 2009, Japan&rsquo;s total population stood at just over 127 million, but that figure is projected to decline to 95 million by 2050. And if more drastic measures fail to encourage people to have sex  &mdash;  and hence children  &mdash;  then there will be a mere 47.7 million Japanese at the turn of the next century.</p>
<p>According to the survey of 671 men and 869 women, issued by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 35.1 per cent of men aged 16 to 19 said they are not interested in or averse to sex, more than double the 17.5 per cent of men in the previous study in 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, the most important reason for Japan&rsquo;s declining birth rate is that people are not having sex,&#8221; Dr. Kunio Kitamura, head of the Japan Family Planning Association, told The Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combined with the rising number of elderly people, this population imbalance is a major problem,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Equally worrying, he said, is the increase in the number of married couples who are officially recognised as &#8220;sexless,&#8221; meaning they have not had sex for more than one month.</p>
<p>The figure has risen to 40.8 percent of all married couples, up from 36.5 percent two years ago and 31.9 percent in 2004.</p>
<p>The government has attempted a series of campaigns to encourage couples to have more children  &mdash;  from making companies insist that their staff leave work at 6pm to increasing child allowances  &mdash;  but none of that is gong to have an impact if people are not going to have sex, Kitamura said.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s about as hilarious as news stories get.  Really funny.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a study reported by a feminist who said that 75% of couples would rather hug than have sex.</p>
<p>And these people are walking the streets without any medical assistance!</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t really speak to why the Japanese aren&rsquo;t having sex with each other. Probably working too much.</p>
<p>But I will say this: the article seems to have an unstated assumption that a shrinking overall population is a bad thing.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Yes, we know that there is an orthodoxy in the West that our social safety net requires sort of a demographic ponzi scheme, where an ever larger number of working age people keep a society&rsquo;s elderly from having to eat cat food. But this view doesn&rsquo;t even allow for the possiblity that a society might decide that tightening their belts and accepting some sacrifice might be worth it for them, if they so decide.</p>
<p>I think the world could stand to get a lot less crowded. There would be much less strain on the planet and much more individual freedom as there would be less competition for resources and less need for people to negotiate the stresses of living ever closer together.</p>
<p>The Japanese might want to do something about having sex with each other more&hellip; but as far as the population getting smaller goes - I think they might be onto something.</p>

		<p>  I don&rsquo;t see what age groups were considered for this research, but the idea of men not being interested in sex seems odd to me. I do wonder if they are so overworked and overcrowded that the sexual urges of healthy young men are actually repressed. A scary thought. <br>
  I consider myself a paleoconservative, but one issue I tend to agree with the tree huggers on is overpopulation. I think that a stable world population, much smaller than it is today, would be better for all concerned. How that would come about without imposing the left&rsquo;s New World Order is the obvious fly in the ointment. But my personal opinion is that if we don&rsquo;t find a way to stabilize it, the problem will take care of itself, and probably not in a very pleasant way.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a statistician, but can a representative sample of the attitudes of a population of 127,360,000 be attained with that small number?  In any case, I suspect this article is nonsense, as was the study upon which it was based.  I highly doubt one-third of young Japanese men are really uninterested in sex.  Uninterested in procreation?  Maybe.  But uninterested in sex?  I don&rsquo;t buy it.  I&rsquo;ll bet the Japanese would get a laugh out of this &#8220;research.&#8221; </p>

		<p> I think they are doing what Nature is asking of them, which is to not have any more children. They live on an island an overcrowded island. If the Haitians followed their plan one million would not have died last year because they would have used birth control and not overcrowded the island. <br>
 Even if the population is half what it is today thats sill a lot of Japanese DNA</p>

		<p>&#8220;men aged 16 to 19&#8221; in a civilized society are supposed to be preoccupied with getting a job or else appropriate level of education needed to get a job. Once they get are in the workforce, they can go on to marry and have children. Of course, Japan has a big youth unemployment problem, just like much of the rest of the world America included. For traditional minded young men who are unable to marry for economic reasons it is not a bad thing (though not an easy one by any means) to delay sex. Too bad that their government is not solving the root cause problem, which is the unemployment.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of historical writing about fertility cults and fertility trends. There&rsquo;s also lots of analysis about social movements in general. The Japanese should put the two together within the modern Japanese context. Try out different things. Apply resources and find motivations among population groups. Establish dedicated professor chairs. Make solid political appointments to TV, film and radio. Get social workers to recommend responsible child-rearing in therapy. School curricula will set good examples  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why the Japanese are so reluctant to get started on the program. It&rsquo;s an interesting challenge and solving it could be fun.</p>

		<p>Those commenting on the joys of a shrinking population would do well to reconsider. The pressure from slight population growth prevents immigration. Nature abhors a vacuum. If you don&rsquo;t fill it then someone else will.</p>

I have read on a number of occasions that after bubonic plague killed one third of the population of Europe the standard of living for the survivors was higher than ever before in history. There was more of everything good to go around. The standard of living of contemporary Europeans and Japanese is currently higher than ever before in history. The decline in the birth rate is certainly a major reason.<br>
 <br>
The relationship between population and living standards can be explained with an equation:<br>
 <br>
(level of technology x natural resources) / population = standard of living<br>
 <br>
Also, more people mean more consumers and more job applicants. By the law of supply and demand that means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits. Social conservatives like population growth because they oppose abortion, dislike birth control, and favor large families. Economic conservatives agree with me that population growth benefits the plutocracy at the expense of everyone else. They disagree that that is a problem.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous (comment 4) - I&rsquo;m sure the elderly will survive - people are much fitter at older ages nowadays, due to much better nutrition and better medical facilities.<br>
The ONLY people who want an ever increasing population are the banksters, who need more and more people to take out loans, to support their fractional reserve counterfeiting scam.<br>
Just think about it. Japan is incredibly overcrowded, and what they cannot manufacture is LAND or living space. As the number of  young people decreases, they inherit what the larger number of elderly created and worked for all their lives, so the younger will have the benefit of their parents&rsquo; and grandparents&rsquo; hard work. <br>
If we don&rsquo;t reduce the world population NOW, we are in for hell on earth once Peak Oil hits us. <br>
I would rather be in a country of 20 million when that happens, than 120 million.</p>

		<p>What exactly is wrong with their population falling to 95 million in a country no bigger than the size of California?  As the population falls it will get younger and it will reach a point where it starts growing again.  I would hope that this phenomenon which started in the West will spread around the globe and indeed even in developing countries the birthrate is starting to decrease although I have doubts about Africa.  The only people who have a problem with this are the corporatists who although they will still make profits, that profit margin will shrink every year for the forseeable future.  Of course, they will have to pay higher wages in a scarce labor market and the price of consumables will go down because of less demand.  </p>

<p>Which is why the Japanese are developing robots to do their menial labor for them. The nice thing about robots (as opposed to third-world immigrants) is that they don&rsquo;t have to be pestered to do their jobs, they don&rsquo;t consume welfare, they don&rsquo;t riot or commit crimes, and they don&rsquo;t demand voting rights. And they can be scrapped when they&rsquo;re no longer useful. If only Europeans and white Americans would copy the Japanese on this trend.</p>

		<p>Let us hope for Japan&rsquo;s sake it doesn&rsquo;t decide the answer is to bring in very &#8216;fertile&rsquo; African and Arab immigrants. Better to have a country with a high proportion of elderly than a country where elderly can&rsquo;t even walk the street at night. </p>

		<p>If I had to venture a guess.. I suspect an essential element to this stand off&hellip;between the yin and yang of Japan&hellip;  is due to feminist patterns immerging in a society that operates on close delicate margins of testoserone and estrogen. In other words I&rsquo;m guessing that with assertive women.. educated and gainfully employed.. independent&hellip;the usual energy dynamic between young males and females&hellip; is deformed or still born. The difference between the males and females (socially ) has been negated..and so the usual desire for the &#8216;other&rsquo;&hellip;has likewise diminished. This process is also part of western culture to a lesser degree as I see it, notice the shrinking reproduction of whites..</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t really see the problem with having an older population. My great grandfather plowed the fields behind a mule well into his 80s. Many of the jobs today take a minimum of physical fitness, we no longer live in a world where a worker needs to spend 12 hours a day in the hot sun. A sober 70 year old worker can be a lot more productive than a 20 year old that&rsquo;s drugged out, drunk or just plain lazy.  </p>
<p>The real problem that I see is that a large portion of the population is either to dumb or to lazy to support themselves.<br>
What&rsquo;s needed are more productive citizens and not just a higher birth rate. </p>

		<p>Japanese men do have a thing for women in short schoolgirl skirts and life-like robotic substitutes for the real thing.<br>
Go figure. Must have something to do with living 100 to a square meter and watching their country shrivel in significance on the world stage, while their age-old rival China is on the rise&hellip;or maybe there is something in their saki? My personal theory is that all the toxic mercury they get from eating anything that floats, crawls or swims in the sea, including protected whales from the Antarctic, is affecting their brains. </p>

		<p>Feminism is an increasing part of Japan&rsquo;s societal norms just as it is in America. Women compete with men for position and are not interested in a man earning less because he is perceived as less in her eyes. Women are hard wired that way to search for men who will make them feel secure by them being less powerful. </p>
<p>Conversely a man faced with the same dilemma is less interested in sex because he is less powerful less able to provide less important in the eyes of females. This creates a rise in sex crimes, homosexuality (among both sexes) and over all animosity within the culture. Men hating women and women hating men. </p>
<p> When the melody doesn&rsquo;t match the lyrics you have discord and that&rsquo;s what we have. The biblical and christian traditions handed down at the Wedding at Cana and the sublime example of the holy family is what works. The Japanese had traditions that worked but we meddeled in thier affairs during the Marshall Plan and they are now a refection of western technology and society. </p>

		<p>Maybe it is associated with cultural matters.  In Korea and Japan, boys and girls in their teens are constantly and firmly reminded that it is morally wrong for people in their teens to ever freely express their sexual desires or sexual fantasies in public.  However, it is becoming less strict nowadays. </p>

		<p> As an earlier reader remarked I strongly doubt that a third of<br>
young Japanese men are not interested in sex&hellip;possibly not sex for procreation or maybe results have been taken out of context from<br>
the original questions..if you are in Japan and trawl the internet via computer or mobile phone you would think with all the online pornograpghy and advertising  one encounters that Japanese are doing it all the time!Young and old! <br>
  Japanese often take a different view on sex without the often shame based moralistic Christian views that have greatly influenced the West.Keeping  out the Western powers from Japan for so long probably was an excuse enough to keep the decadence and bawdy fun of old Tokyo going strong.<br>
 Knowing enough Japanese men(and women) who appear to be as interested in sex and sexual related matters as their Western counterparts makes me really question how valid this survey is.On the other hand sex for procreation specifically is a real<br>
issue as the declining birth rate attests to.       <br>

<p> &#8220;What exactly is wrong with their population falling to 95 million in a country no bigger than the size of California?&#8221;<br>
  [13  &mdash;  Anonymous]<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Exactly. Ninety-five million would still be a huge population (imagine California with that many!) and would still place it among the most populous countries of the world   &mdash;   nearly a third of the USA!  I don&rsquo;t think a country with a current population of 127 million has any need to be worrying about its population disappearing.  As others have pointed out, it could be a blessing in disguise.   It means more space, more resources, more of everything for everyone. What&rsquo;s wrong with that? China is working to achieve this kind of result. In Japan it&rsquo;s happening naturally, without coercion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, populations and birth rates do not remain static. At some point, the birth rate would naturally begin to rise again.</p>
<p>I both agree and disagree with Fred, who said:  &#8220;Nature abhors a vacuum. If you don&rsquo;t fill it then someone else will.&#8221;  </p>
<p>True   &mdash;    but not necessarily so!  That will happen only if you ALLOW it to happen. It does not have to be that way.  If you helplessly stand by and allow others to pour in and colonize your country (or if you even encourage them!), then that is your fault. It was not inevitable.</p>
<p>Many here have pointed out the beneficial results of the Black Plague in Europe. And there have been many other similar instances over the centuries   &mdash;   wars, famines, and such   &mdash;   after which the population recovered and restored itself naturally&hellip;. just so long as there was no foreign invasion and re-settlement. </p>
<p>The Thirty Years War ravaged Central Europe and virtually depopulated entire regions of Germany. Afterwards, left alone,  the population began to restore itself by natural increase - like a forest recovering after a fire. Of course, this was a matter of generations; but if Germany&rsquo;s empty spaces had been re-settled by colonizers of an alien race, there would be no Germany today.<br>

		<p>John (post 22) is absolutely right. I have known quite a lot of Japanese and as a conservative I find their liberal attitudes to sex almost a bit disturbing. To say they are not interested in sex seems pretty off-base to me. Not interested in having kids? Sure, but welcome to the club.</p>

<p>11)  I do agree that the black death helped Europe in the long run. Countries that were hit harder by it were quicker to industrialize and had fairer legal systems, etc.  </p>
<p>However:<br>
1) It took some thirty years (a generation back then) before the standard of living for the average European exceeded the pre-black death standard of living. In the short run the black death resulted in economic misery.<br>
2) The black death killed the old, sick and weak at a greater rate than the youth. The modern problem, on the other hand, results in large number of old people who are set in their ways being in control of the government. So, while the black death forced needed social and economic change, the modern problem could actually result in a situation where it&rsquo;s impossible to make needed changes. &#8220;Needed social change&#8221; here probably means reforming programs like Social Security. Do you think that&rsquo;s going to happen when the average voter is 58? </p>
<p>I believe that the problem will result in a huge block of old people who strangle our countries by refusing to deal with impending problems.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;d be very curious to know the rate of prescription antidepressant usage in Japan. Lack of sexual desire is a very common side effect of them, as advertised on virtually all antidepressants aside from   Wellbutrin. Just a thought&hellip; </p>
<p>I thought perhaps AIDS was going to be the Great Plague that significantly reduced the planet&rsquo;s population, but I was wrong. I know it has killed many people, but the birthrates of (especially with  African, third world and Muslim) peoples, the strain on our world will continue to wreak havoc with the planet, economies, world powers and the quality of life.</p>

		<p>My grandfather&rsquo;s body rests to this day inside the battleship Arizona at the bottom of Pearl Harbor, so you will pardon me if I shed no tears for the disappearing Japanese.  Eventually their country can be occupied by the Chinese, and the Asian race will march mightily on, as the white race continues to dwindle.<br>
Hey!  Why didn&rsquo;t we settle Japan when we had the chance?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe we should put any stock in surveys anymore because of the ways they are conducted and interpreted.  Take the DADT-repeal military survey, for instance.  Around 50% said they had mixed feelings about a repeal, yet the MSM added this number to the 20% positve and proclaimed that 70% were in favor!  And look at the conclusions about the Japanese sex survey  &mdash;  that the birthrate is down because men aren&rsquo;t as interested in sex.  Don&rsquo;t people in modern Japan know about and practice birth control?  Is it possible that Japanese men consider it unwise or unseemly to tell survey takers about their level of interest in sex?  Do they trust the info to remain anonymous and not be available to their bosses or the government?  I&rsquo;ll bet the geisha houses and Japanese-men-only brothels are still doing plenty of business in the island nation!</p>

		<p>Roger #28, my heartfelt thoughts are with you. The honor, sacrifice and gift to this country by the men and women of our military in WWII have been erased from our history, and it pains me very deeply. Your grandfather and my father would be incredulous at the unmitigated disaster our [leaders] have made of the country they built.</p>
<p>My husband and I wonder if they would be stunned at the number of Americans -even of WWII age - that are driving around in Toyotas, Nissans and Hondas.  Yes, I know &#8216;times have changed&rsquo;, but whether they&rsquo;re built here or not the money still goes back to Japan.</p>

		<p>All of the commenters here seem to be missing the point behind this article from the Telegraph, which is the Western mainstream media&rsquo;s obsession with race replacement through multiculturalism. </p>
<p>The silly talk about sex is really just a false flag operation to conceal the true agenda of our elites. </p>
<p>Westerners want Japan to emulate our multi-racial model; the fact that the Japanese remain fiercely homogeneous as a nation and even racially proud is  intolerable to them. </p>

<p>&#8220;Those commenting on the joys of a shrinking population would do well to reconsider. The pressure from slight population growth prevents immigration. Nature abhors a vacuum. If you don&rsquo;t fill it then someone else will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmm,&hellip; interesting. But when we see people ACTUAKKY living in nature, their populations are actually far less than even Japans, which like all civilizations have a huge artificial advantage over a population that lives without all the man made and developed advantages.  This means that the vacuum you refer to is man made, not natural.</p>
<p>It may be natural for sex drive to shrink in overpopulated societies that are homogeneous are due to more natural ebbs and flows of a real population density model that isn&rsquo;t for example, being affected by international immigration treaties and politics that bring in alien populations, races and ethnic groups that will cause another unnatural vacuum.  </p>
<p>Interesting things have been observed in populations density studies.  Decades old experiments demonstrated that homosexuality increases in crowded populations of rats, as does reasonless aggression.  That is one reason why while I don&rsquo;t mind that there is homosexuality and that they need to have human rights as any, I do object to their parenting, since it is the purpose of their homosexuality (in so far as it is natural) to take them out of the breeding pool and thereby help maintain a healthy overall population density.  Problematic population pressures occurred in Japan a few decades ago.  The Japanese would rather become less economically dominant than people their island with non-Japanese, because they have such an emotional connection to their identity as Japanese and have incidentally, a strong cultural/religious regard for their ancestors (something I promote for whites, and something Christianity erased and makes unimportant).  Their determination to remain Japanese is something we ought to respect them for and demand the right to emulate!</p>

		<p><i>The ONLY people who want an ever increasing population are the banksters, who need more and more people to take out loans, to support their fractional reserve counterfeiting scam.</i></p>
<p>While I agree with the overall thrust of your argument (Japan is crowded and Japanese would love more elbow room), I disagree with this point.  Business interests <i>in general</i> align with population growth.  Not just the banksters.</p>
<p>Higher population means more customers, period.</p>
<p>Time to put business interests in the back seat and let survival interests take the wheel, folks.  Libertarians and dollar-worshippers either have to accept this, or find someone other than those interested in survival to pal around with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for westerners to put the dollar-worship to bed.  I am not &#8220;anti-capitalist,&#8221; in the sense that I think capitalism is evil or bad.  I don&rsquo;t.  I think it&rsquo;s a tool, no more evil than a shovel or a gun.  But when you start worshiping your tools, it&rsquo;s time for a padded cell.</p>
<p>I am &#8220;anti-capitalist&#8221; in the sense that I place several interests ahead of financial interests; to &#8220;capitalists,&#8221; (dollar-worshippers), that means I&rsquo;m &#8220;anti-capitalist&#8221; or &#8220;communist&#8221; or some other convenient label.</p>
<p>So be it.  I see &#8220;homo economicus&#8221; as just as dangerous as &#8220;homo Sovieticus,&#8221; and I&rsquo;m willing to take the hit from the loss of the former&rsquo;s friendship (it really does seem like a vast proportion of westerners are &#8220;homo economicus&#8221;).</p>
