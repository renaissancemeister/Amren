	<p>Married, two-parent households are not always best for children, according to a new study by UC Irvine economist David Neumark.</p>
<p>His research shows the increased incarceration of minority men in the U.S. has contributed to more single-parent minority households and fewer minority high school dropouts. The findings are surprising, he says, as they contradict both liberal and conservative views as well as current public policy initiatives.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>&#8220;Incarceration rates affect the supply of potential husbands in what is still a largely same-race marriage market,&#8221; Neumark says. The study, co-authored by Keith Finlay, Ph.D. &#164;07, an assistant professor of economics at Tulane University, appears in the current issue of the quarterly Journal of Human Resources.</p>
<p>Between 1970 and 2000, the researchers found, the nationwide incarceration rate for blacks and Hispanics 18 to 40 increased 7.3 and 1.5 percentage points, respectively, while the rate of incarcerated whites grew by 1 percentage point. At the same time, the number of children living with never-married mothers rose 1 percentage point among whites, 3.4 percentage points among Hispanics and 18.5 percentage points among blacks, while the number of high school dropouts among all races was cut nearly in half.</p>
<p>&#8220;The results indicate that the increasing incarceration rate of minority men is directly linked to a decrease in the number of minority high school dropouts,&#8221; Neumark says. &#8220;By removing potentially lower-quality husbands and fathers from the marriage market via incarceration, it appears, their negative influence on children in the home is reduced. So although a higher incarceration rate leaves in its wake a higher number of never-married mothers, their children actually end up doing better.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>&#8220;Marriage promotion policies presume that marriage itself will directly improve outcomes for children, yet our findings show that encouraging marriage for poor, unmarried mothers may not improve outcomes for their children  &mdash;  and could even worsen them, depending on which marriages form as a result of such policies,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Why is this surprising? When you remove the bad element, be it from your family or the community, community and family life get better. That&rsquo;s why we have prisons.</p>

		<p>Lower quality husband material usually hooks up with lower quality wife material. Both make atrocious parental material.  There seems to be an ample supply of both even with the high arrest rates of those in that &#8216;same race marriage market&rsquo; and their spawn grow up to be just more of the same.</p>

		<p> My first reaction to this was, &#8220;Yeah! It proves what we&rsquo;ve been saying all along, about black men in particular!&#8221;   &mdash;   or words to that effect. My second reaction, however, was, &#8220;This sounds like a wish dream of some radical feminist   &mdash;   that women can do just fine raising their children on their own, without any interference from those nasty old men, and, hey, the kids turn out even better than they do in two-parent families! Men are unnecessary!!&#8221;</p>
<p> In other words, the study sounds suspiciously slanted to me, and it also smacks of a, &#8220;Men? Yuk! To hell with them!&#8221; attitude. In this case, my gender consciousness overwhelms my racial realism. And by the way, where are the cries of &#8220;racism&#8221; about thea study&rsquo;s implied conclusion: That black and Hispanic men are, in the main, worthless as husbands and fathers?  </p>

		<p>The opening sentence is wildly misleading, and no doubt, intentionally so! This has nothing to do with marriage per se, but EVERYTHING to do with typical Black(and Brown)behavior.</p>
<p>Among fully civilized peoples, the traditional family unit(ie. married/two parent family)is unquestionably the ideal. It figures that among Blacks and Browns this wisdom would be stood on its head!  </p>

<p>*MOST IMPORTANT*<br>
Impregnated more than one welfare queen: sterilization, mandatory<br>
Become pregnant while receiving ANY welfare: barred forever from any welfare<br>
Being on welfare: three years of injected birth control, mandatory (for males, fathering a child results in eight months of incarceration) </p>

		<p>Now I know where the term &#8220;psycho-babble&#8221; comes from. Completely missisng from this study is the element of completeness and common sense.

		<p>I think they need to fine tune their research. Do not the black mothers tend to whelp from multiple fathers?<br>
If so, then it becomes an issue of children vs. STEPfathers, which provides a more rational conclusion for this study. Getting browbeaten by a man at home who is NOT your father destroys the relative comfort of a single momma household.</p>

		<p>So according to him a black child having contact with their own father might be detrimental to the child. Whew, that really says something. However, water finds it&rsquo;s own level. If these men are &#8220;lower-quality&#8221; then what does it say about the women who are involved? It takes two to tango, they surely couldn&rsquo;t be very classy themselves.  </p>

		<p>I think the real point of this indicates the children have DIRECT examples of what bad behavior will get them, so they tend to amend behaviors away from that of their incarcerated prone fathers and into something quite opposite for fear of going to the pokie behind daddy. Probably adding to this would be the children&rsquo;s mothers constant reminders of consequences.</p>

		<p>Everybody knows that certain races have higher levels of male hormone, which makes them more aggressive.  I bet that they are more likely to beat their families so when black fathers leave there is probably more peace in the home, which is more conducive to studying.  And yes, Wayne, it probably was a woman who did this research because black women know that black men are losers.  Just because they know it does not mean that they like for you to know it.</p>

		<p>With generations of black men living like virtual Peter Pan it&rsquo;s no wonder their children might be better off without them.  What possible use is any man who won&rsquo;t grow up and demonstrate responsibility for their offspring?  <br>
 <br>
However, the article should have illustrated the FACT that this is very rarely the case with white men.  In white families the lack of a man generally leads to a lack of guidance during crucial developmental years.  During this same time in black families the men are generally the opposite influence because black kids get to see the &#8220;men&#8221; in their society doing very little for them and setting an example of pure sloth and depravity.  I fail to see why black men are so unable to feel shame.<br>
 <br>
It seems like the article has a dual agenda, sure, but it&rsquo;s still nice to see the absolute truth presented.  Even if they do try to sugar coat it afterward.<br>

Or not. It gave him time to build up a romanticized image of his father (and Africans in general), thanks in no small part to his white mother&rsquo;s encouragement. If he had actually spent a significant amount of time around his father growing up (as his younger half-brother by wife number 3 did) he might not have grown up with as many illusions about the inherent nobility of his father&rsquo;s race. Even if it wasn&rsquo;t better for him, it would certainly be better for the rest of us.</p>

		<p>My cousin is a high school graduate but was rejected by the Army because his ASVAB score was below the minimum.  I knew other kids from his school district that graduated after going in once a week to pick up a packet of dittos and turn in the one from the previous week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that the only &#8220;workable&#8221; solution the do-gooders have come up with to the dropout rate was to water down standards, letting more students get through at a lower achievement rate. </p>
<p>All this bogus &#8220;study&#8221; shows is a coincidence, nothing more.  The fact that more poor male role models are squirreled away in prison is neither here nor there.  High school dropout rates are down because high school is a big joke.  And apparently so is the economics department at UC Irvine.</p>
