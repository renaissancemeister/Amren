<h1>Police Believe Child Was Killed With Welding Torch</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dean, KPRC (Houston), December 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Homicide investigators said a welding torch is the likely weapon used in 12-year-old Jonathan Foster&rsquo;s death, Local 2 Investigates reported Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re talking crematorium-type of hot,&#8221; said one Houston Police Department Homicide Squad officer assigned to the investigation.</p>
<p>Police said they confiscated a badly burned section of carpet from the home of Mona Yvette Nelson, 44, who stands charged with capital murder.</p>
<p>She had a welding background and police found welding equipment in her home on Allwood Street in the Fifth Ward area of Northeast Houston. Police said a section of carpet was badly burned and the smell of a human body filled the area around that carpet.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One investigator assigned to the case said it now appears Foster was killed at that spot in Nelson&rsquo;s home within hours of being kidnapped from his family&rsquo;s home near Shepherd Drive and 43rd Street in Northwest Houston.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One officer said on Friday that the autopsy has ruled out any trauma on the child&rsquo;s body. There were no broken bones or any signs of strangulation or head wounds, so officers said it now appears the child was killed with a welding torch that could be capable of 6,000-degree flames.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve never seen burns like this,&#8221; said one officer who viewed the boy&rsquo;s body after it was found in a ditch off the Hardy Toll Road on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said that killers often try to cover their tracks by burning the victim&rsquo;s corpse, but in this boy&rsquo;s case, the burning was so intense and thorough that many veteran homicide investigators are struggling with the notion of such a grisly and painful way to die.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for a motive, one HPD investigator said officers believe sexual abuse was behind the crime.</p>
<p>The officer said there is no evidence to confirm the theory at this point, but police say there was no ransom demand after the boy was kidnapped, so one officer said, &#8220;That&rsquo;s the only other motive (that makes any sense).&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nelson is jailed without bond with a court appearance set for Monday.</p>
<p>Police spent Friday interviewing the child&rsquo;s family once again, shoring up the timeline of events and filling in routine gaps in the statements that were given immediately after the crime.</p>
<p>They also spent several hours organizing the carpet and other evidence confiscated from Nelson&rsquo;s home. One officer said, &#8220;We got all we need (from there).&#8221;<br>

						<p>
							<i>Sally MacDonald, Houston News, December 30, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A 44-year-old grandmother is already accused of killing one child and then burning his body with a welding torch. Now Houston Police are looking into the possibility Mona Yvette Nelson is a serial predator.</p>
<p>Houston Police say Nelson acted alone when she kidnapped and killed 12-year-old Jonathan Foster on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>Nelson has been charged with capital murder and is being held without bond.</p>
<p>Police say Nelson has confessed to dumping Foster&rsquo;s charred remains in a ditch but does not admit killing him.</p>
<p>Activist Quannel X met with Nelson for about an hour Thursday afternoon upon her request. He says she does not yet have an attorney.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police are confident Nelson planned the killing on her own. Detectives say they grilled the people she tried to implicate, documented every second of their day and determined they weren&rsquo;t involved.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nelson often did maintenance work at apartment complexes on Oak Street in northwest Houston where Foster was last seen. On Christmas Eve police say Nelson took Foster, who had been left home alone, from a small cottage next to an apartment complex, then killed and dumped his body just hours later.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The break in the case came when surveillance cameras on a nearby business showed the image of a silver pickup truck and a woman dumping a body in a ditch. Police say a witness reported seeing the same woman and truck earlier in the day at the apartment complex. When confronted with the video, detective Miller says Nelson admitted she was the one seen dumping the body.</p>
<p>The body turned out to be Jonathan Foster.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Nelson&rsquo;s garage apartment on Allwood in the North Forest area, Miller says detectives stumbled onto a wealth of evidence, including burned carpet, twine found around Jonathan&rsquo;s hands and welding torches police believe Nelson used after she killed him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police admit it&rsquo;s hard to believe a 44-year-old woman would suddenly choose to kidnap, kill and burn the body of a child. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re checking to see if she may be involved in similar cases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nelson&rsquo;s criminal past dates back to 1984, when she went to prison for aggravated robbery. She&rsquo;s also spent time in jail for a bad check, marijuana, making a terroristic threat and criminal mischief.<br>

		<p>Beyond depravity. If there is an upside to such a horrific crime, is that the perp was stupid enough to commit this atrocity in Texas. At least there she will be executed at some point. </p>
<p>Here in NY, even if she received the death penalty she would never be executed. </p>

<p>I have read some sickening things in my life, but this has to be about one of the very worst atrocities I have ever had the misfortune to encounter in print. The woman who did this is not a member of the human race, or even fit to be called an animal; she is an abominable monster, with neither a conscience or soul. It is enough to say that her punishment should fit her crime, but it won&rsquo;t. She will likely be allowed to continue her worthless and psychopathic existence in some prison, where she will mindlessly continue to plead her &ldquo;innocence&rdquo; and bellow about &ldquo; societal racism,&rdquo; while gleefully terrorizing her fellow prison peers at the same time. Who knows, this she-demon might even get the chance to kill again and all at the expense of the taxpayers.</p>

		<p>Not since the Death Angels murdered sixty plus young white girls and boys in San Francisco in th seventies ( &#8220;Zebra, The true account of the 179 days of terror on San Francisco&#8221;, by Clark Howard, California Indictment 88244, May 16, 1974), has there been another crime as revolting as this murder of a white child<br>
because of his race by an African American.<br>
   Ths is only the very tip the iceberg when whites being killed by other races is concerned; if not for that security camera the police investigators would be forced to conclude that a white man did the murder, as their politically correct training makes clear.</p>

		<p>There was a time, a century ago, when an incident like this would have resulted in an outraged mob leaving the black section of town burnt to the ground.</p>
<p>And that would be that.</p>
<p>Not now, in this age of white groveling and conciliation. Now, there will be denials, concessions, calls to &#8220;reach out&#8221;,  more sensitivity programs, the inevitable candlelight vigils, sermons,  and insistence (from all sides) that<b> <i>&#8220;Race had nothing to do with it&#8221;.</i></b> </p>
<p>We know all this in advance. We&rsquo;ve seen it before.</p>
<p>Until the next incident.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t expect too much help or sympathy from the police or politicians.  The new PD Chief is black,  so he will not want to see any racial aspects in this crime.  The racial make-up of the Houston PD is now listed as 40% non-white. <a href="https://www.houstontx.gov/police/chief/" rel="nofollow">https://www.houstontx.gov/police/chief/</a></p>
<p>The Chief may be a fine and dedicated man, but he is still  black, and inevitably  is going to take a black perspective. <br>
<i>[&#8220;McClelland was brought into one patrol division to quell racial tensions.&#8221;   &mdash;   Wiki]</i></p>
<p>We all know that &#8220;residual white racism&#8221; will be found at the root of this. Bring on the sensitivity experts! This will be another &#8220;teaching moment&#8221; for them.</p>

		<p>This will quickly be sent down the memory hole by the complicit anti-white media.  How many stories of black atrocity do the police and their media accomplices hide from us every day?  As for this inhuman beast that tortured Jonathan Foster, I hope that the state of Texas will do what is needed.  Some crimes should be an automatic death penalty.</p>

<p>The only motive that makes sense is an intense and overwhelming hate of whites. ALL whitey must be gotten rid of type of stuff.</p>
<p>This type of killing is the product of a very depraved an malevolent mentality, an abomination to the human race. Mona and if she had others with her doing this deed derived an intense and perverse pleasure out of the atrocity.</p>
<p> I suppose &#8220;Superfly&#8221; Quannel X is Black Muslim of some sort. A gang initiation or Black Muslims are involved somehow? The investigators need to see if this &#8220;human&#8221; [Mona] had accomplices or whatever. The Zebra killers in San Fran from way back placed great emphasis on the ability of a Bantu to kill a white child. And the gorier and more grotesque the BETTER.</p>
<p>AND everyone on this forum needs to pass the details along to whoever will listen and understand what has happened. This atrocity needs to be publicized BIG TIME!<br>

We would be happy to march in any pro-white vigils that speak for the innocent white victims of random violent black-on-white crimes. If white liberals can defend these black criminals, why can&rsquo;t we dark skinned Indians (who look black in the eyes of some) stand up and speak for the white victims.

The Blacks insolence and savagery is unrivaled by any other race on earth, the Blacks have acted with impunity for too long, they speak freely and openly about there intent to harm us while politicians&rsquo; look the other way. It&rsquo;s time for us as Europeans to show are displeasure and let those who are suppose to represent us know; it&rsquo;s ok to discuss race problems, in fact we insist upon it. </p>

		<p>Just when you think you&rsquo;ve heard just about all manor of evil and injustice in this world, you read about something like this atrocity. Compounded by our derelict media. Shame on them all!</p>
<p>On December 29th, 2010 Nancy Grace&rsquo;s show featured the discovery of Jonathan Foster&rsquo;s burned body in a ditch after reporting about his disappearance the nights before that. </p>
<p>I read the next day, the 30th, on New Nation News about the arrest of Mona Yvette Nelson. I tuned in to Nancy Grace that night and the next, hoping they would do the right thing and report that Nelson had been arrested. But since the &#8220;koolaid&#8221; has worn off, I didn&rsquo;t hold out much hope. And, sure enough, not a peep about the arrest of this monster on her show or any other mainstream media outlet.</p>
<p>It made me so mad that I e-mailed her show, having to give them my name and e-mail address, which I could care less and told them what I thought of their reporting. Short and sweet. This is basically what I wrote: &#8220;After getting me emotionally invested in the murder of Jonathan Foster, I can not believe you did not follow up the next night or the one after with the arrest of his murderer. WHY? Because he was white and she was black? Are you that afraid to report the numerous black on white crime occuring in this country? Shame on you. I&rsquo;m glad there are other news sources for me and the rest of the white race to get accurate and timely reporting. This will greatly curtail my viewing of Nancy Grace&rsquo;s show.&#8221; </p>
<p>It was cathartic.</p>

<p>I cannot fathom the torture and horror that this poor child went through before he died.</p>
<p>This torturer/murderer &#8216;grandmother&rsquo; is a monster and a beast, the entire DNA line should be eliminated.</p>
<p>And, as usual, no mention of this case on the West Coast, anywhere in the media.</p>
<p>But, why am I seeing the &#8216;name&rsquo; Quantrall X all over FOX&rsquo;s articles?  Why is he allowed to have the spotlight and microphone?  </p>
<p>Why is a White-hating black activist allowed to pontificate all over the media that his &#8216;client&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t do it, despite a mountain of evidence, and implicate the young boy&rsquo;s step-father in the murder?</p>
<p><i>I believe Nelson did play a role in what happened, but I believe her role is disposing of the body&hellip;.She said it was the stepfather, David, who paid her money to dispose of a container that he gave her</i></p>
<p><i>Quannel X says David Davis paid Nelson $20 to throw away the container. Nelson told Quannel X she didn&rsquo;t know what was in the container because she was drunk.</i></p>
<p><i>I believe this child was really a victim of his living circumstances</i> said Quannel X. </p>
<p>You can be sure the black murderer will be portrayed as a victim of White racism in court, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she walks, riots if she doesn&rsquo;t, and she will receive unending, undying support from the black community:</p>
<p>As for the vile Quanell-X:</p>
<p>Quanell viewed Farrakhan as his role model and mentor. Farrakhan taught him about the evils of white people&hellip;the white man is not <b>a</b> devil, he is <b>the</b> devil. [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>Remember Texas Hero Joe Horn?  He shot and killed two illegal aliens:</p>
<p><i>Quanell X&hellip; approached Horn&rsquo;s house to speak to the media. He was overwhelmed by several hundred counter-protesters protecting Horn from Quanell X&rsquo;s accusations. The crowd of counter-protesters included bikers revving their motorcycles, many of them chanting, &#8216;USA,&rsquo; &#8216;Go home,&rsquo; and &#8216;We love our country; what do you love?&rsquo; while waving placards, Texas flags, and US flags.</i> </p>
<p>Quanell eventually made a speech on another street away from Horn&rsquo;s house. The speech included chants of &#8216;black power&rsquo; and the exhortation for blacks to ignore white law.</p>
<p>I am not sure which is more evil, Quanell-X, the killer/torturer &#8216;grandmother&rsquo; of the young White boy or the media for not widely reporting this case.</p>
<p>By tomorrow it will be old news.</p>

		<p>We fail because the White media doesn&rsquo;t come out with some expert on race relations complaining that anti White rhetoric creates a dangerous climate where blacks feel they have permission to take out their rage and hatred through violence.</p>
<p>Whites don&rsquo;t run the media.  There is a racial group that runs the media in every country of the world that doesn&rsquo;t specifically name this racial group as their enemy.  That racial group is not white&hellip;.although they almost universally pass for white (when they work in the media, that is) by changing their names and getting extensive plastic surgery.</p>
<p>There are many fine books out there that document this EXTENSIVELY.  It&rsquo;s a fact, not a theory, conspiracy or otherwise.  And actual conspiracy.  And based on the proven sanitation of news along specific patterns, it is pretty clear what they are doing and why.</p>
<p>The ONLY way to change this is, as a necessary first step, shine a revelatory light on who is doing this.  Name names.</p>
<p>The real question is though, what then.  It is the grim answer to that question that keeps people from exploring the obvious.</p>

The article mentioned sexual assault.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the young man&rsquo;s privates were torched first.  It may be more a case of anti-hetero than anti-white, or a combination of the two as motivationg factors.  This sounds like the reverse of the Matthew Shepard case.

I will agree with what has been said here several times- if this had been a white woman and black child there would be wall to wall coverage on all cable and network outlets. I can also say that there will be no candle light vigils, speeches by the likes of Jesse and Al at the funeral or constant reminders on anniversaries of the event.

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it. I recall a case in West Virginia in 2006 where a black girl said she was raped and covered with dog feces by a white family. I specifically recall Nancy Grace reading the specifics of the case on TV  and stressing the races of the supposed victims/attackers. Last year it came out that the black girl made it up but hardly any media reported this.</p>
<p>It is always the same story with the media and race.<br>

<p>While I dont think any of us would ever condone violence&hellip; can anyone imagine having your son kidnapped on Christmas, then later finding out he was tortured to death in such a horrific manner?

		<p>I actually live near the home where the boy was taken.</p>
<p>I was suprised by how extensively the local news covered the story after the &#8220;perp&#8221; was caught, even showing photos of the black killer and white victim.</p>
<p>The most disturbing detail for me of the already heinous crime&hellip; </p>
<p>&ldquo;There were no broken bones or any signs of strangulation or head wounds, so officers said it now appears the child was killed with a welding torch that could be capable of 6,000-degree flames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next i wondered what savage excuse for a human could possibly do something so terrible. The multicult paradise of South Africa then came to mind as murders of white children have happened in similar fasions there too. this cruelty seems to be part of their nature.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree with that. I wouldn&rsquo;t advocate it commonly. but there some crimes so heinous, some criminals so vicious,  that the entire rot must be gotten out of the gene pool. This is one. </p>
<p>Some other societies have recognized this need. The Japanese, for instance, would execute the entire family for exceptional crimes of great gravity. It was a eugenic procedure, ensuring there would be no more of them to cause trouble in the future.</p>

I did a search for Tacoma Washington drownings for the year and came up with zilch-that is except one-your posting here on amren that such a white on black crime took place  &mdash;  Until you can post a name of the  White perp and his 2 black victims i will flat out say your claim is a Hoax-never Happened-if it did it would have been International News and all the Jesse jacksons and Al Sharptons and the Southern Prosperity(poverty)Law Center would of been all over it and several T.V documentaries and movies would have been made about it.But now that you made the claim that it actually happened maybe they will make a movie of it after all and call it a true story.</p>

		<p>Folks, let&rsquo;s not get too ahead of ourselves here. I&rsquo;m black, and I consider what happened here to be a disgusting, moral outrage. There is no part of me that feels any satisfaction over what happened to this poor child. I would feel no joy or satisfaction if this had happened to a white adult, either. Your conclusions  that race was the reason for this horror may be presumptuous, but, admittedly, there is no doubt that this conclusion would have been reached instantly had the races been reversed. White-on-black violent crime is relatively rare, but when it occurs, it is always presumed to be racially motivated; by blacks, as well as butt-kissing liberal whites. As an aside, the news media are subtle about it sometimes: If there is no evidence to suggest that race is a factor in a white-on-black violent crime, why must they say things like, &#8220;No word yet on whether race was a factor in this attack&#8221;, or &#8220;There&rsquo;s no evidence that this crime was racially motivated&#8221;? In other words, if it&rsquo;s not racial, why must the reporter even speak the words &#8220;race&#8221; and &#8220;racially&#8221;? It&rsquo;s as if they want race to be on your mind, even when there&rsquo;s no reason for it to be.  </p>
<p>Incidents like this elicit the usual questions as to why Al $harpton, Je$$e Jack$on, and other like-minded race hustling blacks aren&rsquo;t getting involved in cases like the one above. That&rsquo;s the problem with so many of you so-called &#8220;white nationalists&#8221;. It&rsquo;s as though you are trying to get as many whites to realize that the aforementioned men are hypocrites. News Flash: much of the world already knows this, and it&rsquo;s not stopping either of these guys from going about their usual business! An even more relevant question is why do you need guys like them to protest such an atrocity, when you, yourselves, won&rsquo;t even bother (except online, that is)?</p>

		<p>I see one big kicker crime leading to a life of resentment and failed dreams as a series of (diverse = follower looking for success in other&rsquo;s scapegoat crimes, leaders usually specialize) minor ones.  Ending with increasing violence as she realizes there is no way out.</p>
<p>IMO, if she were sexually deviant, by now that list would likely include something in it that was relevant.</p>
<p>Without Excuse:  She&rsquo;s been down all her life, I doubt if she is considered pretty, even among her own.  She has been in and out of jail and that record will backslap her on every employment application she makes.</p>
<p>Simple rage is a possibility, with or without racial overtones.  </p>
<p>But I am betting that there is still a related trigger effect, either in obvious SES leveraging, direct action or resemblance to a prior aggravator or some other &#8216;over the edge&rsquo; tipping point intiator.</p>
<p>I do find it strange that a 12 year old male who shows no signs of direct injury resulting in unconsciousness didn&rsquo;t scratch, bite or otherwise wound this woman (with DNA evidence), even if she is physically capable of holding him down long enough to light, focus and manipulate such an awkward weapon as a blow torch.  That -could- indicate experience based on expertise, as could the chosen disposal method/container.</p>
<p>Something is missing here, even if it be only death-in-details minor stuff, it is worth looking for an enabler/helper and a motive.</p>
<p>As for effective punishment, I&rsquo;ve always been of the opinion that prisons only make criminals better trained and more sociopathic.  So unless you are willing to pay 40,000 dollars a year to put them away for life, three strikes on short-stay basis should lead to a needle on the notion of &#8216;proven criminal predilections&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Too late for this woman but something to consider for others when 6% of our nation&rsquo;s population represent 40% of it&rsquo;s criminal incarcerants and 52% of it&rsquo;s murderers.</p>
<p>I do wish our society was not so poor that kids had to live latchkey existences.  I can only imagine what an ENRAGED ADULT PARENT would have done to this woman.  I am sorry we failed you Jonathan.</p>

		<p>This was a truly vile, inhuman act.  That being said, it is also the kind of story the media loves.  Nancy Grace must have been salivating when this story was brought up in the production meeting, it could possibly run for months!  I can just see the crestfallen looks on the producer&rsquo;s faces when they found out the suspect was a black woman.  Uh oh, wrong color, guys.  Drop the story.  </p>
<p>So why drop it?  It could have been a ratings winner.  Is it simply the narrative?  Blacks can only be victims?  I think that they have been intimidated by the NAACP and other civil rights race hustlers to self censor, as to not look like they are exacerbating racial tensions, and make sure that blacks are always portrayed as victims of whites.  Journalists must live in mortal fear of having their liberal progressive credentials questioned.  </p>
<p>The real hypocrisy of it is that their professed overall narrative is racial equality, and race should have no bearing on the reporting.  It does only when the races are configured correctly:  White perp, minority victim.</p>

		<p>Another fact hidden by the politicians and MSM is that black women are dangerous.<br>
 It is a &#8216;law&rsquo; of criminology that in every society studied females (of the same race that is), commit crimes at around 10% of the male rate.Now, in the USA the sexual and racial differentials in crime rates effectively &#8216;cancel out&rsquo; so that on a per capita basis black women are incarcerated at the same rate as White men!<br>
  On correspondent above expressed the hope that Nelson would be the target of retribution by an &#8216;Aryan gang&rsquo; in jail.Well, I  am afraid that&rsquo;s a vain hope.I don&rsquo;t know what the actual figures are, but it&rsquo;s likely that black female inmates in a Texas women&rsquo;s jail outnumber white inmates by several multiples.</p>

<p>Yeah, I agree, there is no way for a woman to hold down a boy and use a blow torch on him at the same time to cause his death, without suffering injuries herself in the process either by the boy or the blowtorch.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope that the boy was unconscious somehow when he was being burnt.</p>
<p>On a different note, the woman seems to have some Samoan features. Not that that would have helped her, since many of the Samoans I&rsquo;ve come across seemed aggressive and a bit unpredictable.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Zebra, The true account of the 179 days of terror in San Francisco&rdquo;, by Clark Howard,&#8221; </p>
<p>The best book on the Zebra killings, the little-publicized long string of murders of whites targeted specifically as whites and killed so that members of an offshoot (just how &#8220;off&#8221; is questionable) group of Nation of Islam members could get their &#8220;death angel wings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every year, a former San Francisco Police Lieutenant, Louis Calabro, has tried to get the city of San Francisco to commemorate the victims of the Zebra Killings, to no avail.</p>
<p>Imagine if some white racial group had murdered somewhere between 50 and 200 (I hope I&rsquo;m remembering those police-estimated figures correctly) blacks to get their &#8220;death angel wings&#8221;!</p>
<p>There would be a museum devoted to it, and yearly week-long observances.</p>
<p>In the case of the Zebra killings, the motive was starkly and admittedly (by the few murderers convicted) racial. In contrast, the Wichita horror, the Knoxville horror, the present case, and many others, can be claimed rightly or wrongly to not be essentially racial. But there is no way to make that claim about the Zebra killings. I wish someone with more initiative than myself would organize a movement solely to publicize relentlessly these killings, since they illustrate vividly so much about the current racial situation and the extremely one-sided way it&rsquo;s treated.</p>

<p>As with the Christian/Newsom Knoxville murders, to me the fundamental racial aspect of this crime is not whether the murderer had racial feelings toward the victim or not (I think virtually all blacks have racial feelings about whites&hellip;how could they not, with their experiences both imagined and real), but the fact that under our former system of segregation, victim and perp would never have come together.</p>

<p>When we Whites complain about racial injustice   &mdash;   which we experience daily in the form of anti-White AA laws   &mdash;    passed over for jobs, college admissions, scholarships and promotion in favor lesser qualified blacks, we are called Hateful, Racist Nazis by the media, academia and the government.</p>

<p>The hateful, anti-White Black AG himself explicitly stated in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee that the new Hate Crimes bill does not protect whites.  He also refused to prosecute explicit White voter intimidation by members of the New Black Panthers.  </p>
<p>The media and academia refuse to report heinous black-on-White crimes, yet tried and convicted the White boys at Duke based on the lies of an unstable black stripper/prostitute in news reports that ran nationwide, 24/7 for months on end.</p>
<p>Where is justice for our people?  Where do we seek redress?</p>
<p>Why was the AmRen conference shut down last year by vile lefties who threatened each hotel and its employee that deigned to host AmRen?  Why did the FBI not investigate these threats?  Why did the Justice Department allow this to happen?  Why can&rsquo;t we WNs convene as is allow the racist, hateful LaRaza?</p>
<p>You see, unlike you and your people, and every other ethnic or racial group, we Whites are not allowed to form advocacy groups that defend and aide our people.<br>
Unlike us Whites, the government does not have its boot on you or your people&rsquo;s necks holding you down at every opportunity.</p>
<p>But then, this war we&rsquo;re in, a War on Whites, is not about you and your people; you are the hostile elites&rsquo; useful idiots, a battering ram used to destroy Whites and White civilization, the Prime Goal of the hostile elites that control the government, academia and the msm.</p>
<p>And, they are dropping you because you&rsquo;ve served your purpose, throwing you under the bus and hooking up with the New Minority, Hispanics, allowing them to ethnically cleanse you out of your historic areas in places like Los Angeles and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Even your politicians support Open Borders which will devastate you faster and further than any so-called White group ever could.</p>
<p>Dig deeper and educate yourself.  Your politicians tell you to be ever vigilant against The Great White Bigot but once we are gone, once you have a new non-White master, you&rsquo;ll realize old Whitey was the best friend blacks ever had.</p>

<p>Bon, what an absolutely amazing post, possibly the very best post I&rsquo;ve ever seen on Amren or anywhere!!</p>
<p>Your first point, in response to notyourtypicalBlack:</p>
<p>&#8220;When we Whites complain about racial injustice  &mdash;  which we experience daily in the form of anti-White AA laws  &mdash;  passed over for jobs, college admissions, scholarships and promotion in favor lesser qualified blacks,..We, unlike you, risk our jobs, careers, pensions and reputations by speaking out against injustice against ourselves and our people.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is absolutely the reason that most of us do no more than we do, and I was foolish to not have even thought of that in my own response to that poster. Even I, retired, would run some substantial and specific risks if I were open in my opposition.*</p>
<p>Your second point to that poster, which is the very fundamental point that you and others here often make, but which I fear some readers may pass over too casually:</p>
<p>&#8220;But then, this war we&rsquo;re in, a War on Whites, is not about you and your people; you are the hostile elites&rsquo; useful idiots, a battering ram used to destroy Whites and White civilization, the Prime Goal of the hostile elites that control the government, academia and the msm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here you identify the deeper source of our problems. Until the &#8220;hostile elites&#8221; are identified and stripped of their power, or until today&rsquo;s rapidly shifting historical circumstances have changed to the point that the self-interest of those elites has become nearly congruent with our own interest (ever the hopeful dreamer, I am), the condition of whites will continue to steadily deteriorate, even if racial segregation were to somehow return.</p>
<p>Your third point to notyourtypicalBlack:</p>
<p>&#8220;And, they (the hostile elites) are dropping you because you&rsquo;ve served your purpose, throwing you under the bus and hooking up with the New Minority, Hispanics, allowing them to ethnically cleanse you out of your historic areas in places like Los Angeles and elsewhere&hellip;.Open Borders which will devastate you faster and further than any so-called White group ever could&hellip;Your politicians tell you to be ever vigilant against The Great White Bigot but once we are gone, once you have a new non-White master, you&rsquo;ll realize old Whitey was the best friend blacks ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow. Your short, beautifully written post summarizes a slice of current history that future historians will (hopefully) labor to summarize nearly as well. An incredible post.</p>
<p>*(But the risks I would run are much less than most of you, and I would be willing to risk a bit more than I currently do, if someone with more initiative than myself would create some avenue where such risks seemed worth it. And probably there are a lot of retired persons with about the same situation and attitude as myself).<br>

		<p>&#8220;Activist <b>Quannel X met with Nelson</b> for about an hour Thursday afternoon <b>upon her request</b> &#8220;</p>
<p>All local media that is reporting this story refuses to mention the race of the suspect or the victim. And though the black perpetrator was allowed to request and receive a meeting with the leader in the local New Black Panther Party, a known black racist and black supremacist, Quannel X, the Police and the media refuse to even consider the possibility that the suspect is an anti-white racist, or that this is a Hate Crime. Referring to Quannel X only as an &#8220;Activist&#8221;, not even a &#8220;Black Activist&#8221;. </p>
<p>Now what do you think of the reaction of the same Media and black leaders would be, had a white suspect requested a meeting with a local leader of the K? </p>
<p>As for this horrific crime, it seems Nancy Grace dropped the story as soon as it became apparent as to the race of the suspect. Even FOX News that did a segment on the child when he was missing, is no longer interested. Not even reporting the capture of a suspect. It seems the MSM cover-up is thorough and complete.<br>

		<p><i>That&rsquo;s my point. This story was never covered by the media. they swept it under the rug!</i><i><p>An incident such as a white man murdering two black children in 2008 in Washington State, one of the most race-liberal states of the nation, in the Tacoma area, one of the most liberal parts of that liberal state, had 0% chance of having been &#8220;swept under the rug&#8221; by the media.  How in the world do YOU know of the incident then? If you have facts concerning the alleged crime, set them forth: who was this racist white man?  What were the names of the children?  How did the incident happen? If the white man was charged and prosecuted, there will be a record of it which can be verified - the police and county DA don&rsquo;t &#8220;sweep under the rug&#8221; crimes like that and the docket of the prosecution for the crime and its disposition will unquestionably be on a statewide computer database. If the man was not arrested or charged, and you know who he is, or know his description, you have a duty not to withhold information on it even now, as murder does not have a statute of limitation.<p>I&rsquo;m sick of self-righteous &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; morally preening trolls popping up here to distract readers from this horrible crime with contrivances of vaporous &#8220;white racist crimes.&#8221; Put up or shut up.   <br>

<p>&#8220;Thang&#8221;? I don&rsquo;t use that type of slang. I understand your point about feeling silenced and unable to publicaly express anger about such happenings as Jonathan Foster&rsquo;s horrific murder. Bear in mind, however, that as many posters here have said before (including me), <i>white liberals</i> are the primary impediment. They are the only ones with the power to suppress anything that smacks even vaguely of white unity/solidarity. Minorities will simply whine, but it&rsquo;s usually white liberals who convert minority anger into actual mistreatment of whites. Remember, this is America, and an unspoken rule is that once you are perceived as being part of a supposedly privileged class, you are afforded no right at all to complain of any mistreatment, however serious. Any vocal complaints are dismissed as resentful whining, or as part of some backlash. Men know this, whites know this, and heaven help those who happen to be both&hellip; </p>
<p>Of course, a case like the one in this article doesn&rsquo;t need any racial solidarity to inspire vocal anger. I&rsquo;m guessing that the perpetrator here will get what she deserves, since she committed her crime in one of the most likely places to hand down a death sentence. </p>
<p>My main point to you is that there must be a distinction drawn between the individual grievances you listed in your post. There&rsquo;s a huge difference between the act of calling someone a racist/Nazi, and the act of taking away his job for allegedly being such. I think many of you worry too much about being called names. I can&rsquo;t see it from your perspective, but remember that once upon a time, feminists were called names for promoting their unusual ideology, yet that ideology dominates academia today. Don&rsquo;t mistake a slow, gradual process for a doomed one. The other grievances (AA, firings, reverse discrimination) can only be addressed through legal action, one reverse discrimination/wrongful termination suit at a time, until mainstream culture inevitably begins to get it. As you&rsquo;ve seen, there has been quite an increase in such &#8220;rebellious&#8221; acts by whites, though many of you here seem too reluctant to rejoice for fear that these attempts are marginal and will go nowhere, and don&rsquo;t want to look foolish for getting your hopes up. </p>
<p>Mainstream media outlets don&rsquo;t run stories like the one above, and put a liberal slant on everything they report. Conservative whites may kvetch, but why should they listen to you? What are you doing for them? Are you a very valuable market actually buying and reading their biased rags, or are you seeking &#8220;alternative&#8221; sources of information? See my point? If you supported them financially, you&rsquo;d be in a better position to make complaints about their tactics. Therefore, more conservative whites should be buying their publications. Then you can withhold your dollars when they displease you in this way. It&rsquo;s a bit like dealing with a child. Which will upset him more? Not giving him candy, or giving it to him, then taking it away?</p>

		<p>&#8220;We must try to be fair, it must be pointed out that white people have done some terrible things to blacks too. In fact there were many more committed by whites than by blacks. Look at all the many lynchings that hapened. these were not black people lynching whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were about 5,000 lynchings from the end of the Civil War to the 1960s, according to the NAACP&rsquo;s own stats. About a third of those lynched were whites. Most were lynched for murders or rapes - not for having the wrong skin color like the this 11-year old boy.</p>
<p>But even if all 5,000 people lynched were black, consider this: Blacks kill more whites (and blacks) every single year!</p>
<p>When it comes to reparations blacks owe a debt they can never repay with their history of rape, murder, racism and terror.<br>
