<h1>Angry Asian UBC Condo Owners to Protest &#8216;Bad Luck&rsquo; Hospice</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Damian Inwood, The Province (Vancouver, BC), January 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dozens of angry Asian residents of a posh, University of B.C., highrise building aim to stage a placard-waving protest rally to protest a 15-bed hospice being planned next door.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot have dying people in our backyard,&#8221; said rally organizer Janet Fan, Wednesday &#8220;It&rsquo;s a cultural taboo to us and we cannot be close to so many dying people. It&rsquo;s like you open your door and step into a graveyard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fan lives on the 17th floor at Promontory, at 2688 West Mall, near Thunderbird Stadium.</p>
<p>She said residents weren&rsquo;t consulted and only found out when an open house on the proposed hospice was scheduled for Monday.</p>
<p>UBC planners are planning to build St. John Hospice next door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next week we&rsquo;re going to organize a march, holding banners, to the office of the president of UBC,&#8221; said Fan, a stay-at-home mom. &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to tell him we don&rsquo;t want this hospice and how enraged, angry and shocked we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fan said 80 per cent of the residents of her 18-storey building are Asian and are strongly opposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Units here are worth $1 million,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We put our life savings into this.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said residents are worried the hospice will have a negative impact on their property values.</p>
<p>Asian residents living in other buildings in the upscale Hawthorn Place neighborhood have signed a 200-name petition, including 65 from Fan&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Qing Lin, who bought a Promontory apartment for $900,000 almost a year ago, said she and her seven year old daughter will have nightmares if the hospice goes ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that people dying outside will bring us bad luck,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I&rsquo;m very angry and upset. If I had known it was going to be a hospice, I wouldn&rsquo;t buy it for half the price.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her neighbour Anglea Gao, 34, clutching her nine-month-old son Ryan, agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very disturbing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My kids and I are going to feel so frightened and angry just to think there are dying people so close to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Residents wrote a letter Jan. 9 to Jan Fialkowski, executive director of the University Neighborhood Association, (UNA) saying they feel a hospice is the equivalent of a funeral home or crematorium.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Death is the Yin and &#8216;Live&rsquo; is the Yang,&#8221; it read. &#8220;If the Yin and Yang are near to each other, &#8216;Death&rsquo; will bring bad luck, meaning sickness and even death.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The ghosts of the dead will invade and harass the living.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter said Asians believe that living next to &#8220;death&#8221; would &#8220;lead to failure of business, the loss of money, the break of marriage and family, and the healthy growing up of children will be affected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharon Wu, chairwoman of the UNA said 60 residents came to a UNA board meeting Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UNA respects cultural beliefs,&#8221; she said. &#8220;UBC is planning to address the concerns of the residents. It&rsquo;s a very emotional and sensitive issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time the hospice has met with opposition.</p>
<p>It met with complaints when it was originally planned for Marine Drive, close to Place Vanier student residences.</p>
<p>Joe Stott, director of Campus and Community Planning, said objections came from students who didn&rsquo;t want to have to keep quiet at night and from Pacific Spirit Park and the Wreck Beach Preservation Society.</p>
<p>Stott admitted planners have been caught by surprise by the latest round of complaints.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prior to the concerns raised on Friday with the UNA, it was to come up before the UBC board of governors in February but now it won&rsquo;t do so,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Stott said the residents&rsquo; concerns will be examined.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are aware that graveyards are a bad thing and funeral homes are a bad thing,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to do some research into this but there&rsquo;s no evidence that a hospice reduces property values.&#8221;<br>
