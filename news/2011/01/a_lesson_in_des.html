<h1>A Lesson in Desegregation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas J. Prohaska and Janice Habuda, Buffalo News, January 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lockport&rsquo;s public schools were desegregated nearly 80 years before the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the change nationally, students learned at a Martin Luther King Day program Monday in the Niagara County Historical Society.</p>
<p>The 16 children who attended the holiday program painted bricks in honor of Aaron Mossell, who owned a brickyard and a hotel in Lockport after the Civil War.</p>
<p>Mossell was hired to sell bricks to the Lockport School District in 1870 for a school on High Street, but when he took his children there after construction was done, they were barred and ordered to attend &#8220;the colored school,&#8221; said Ann Marie Linnabery, historical society education coordinator.</p>
<p>After five years of petitioning the Board of Education, Mossell succeeded in opening the doors of Lockport schools to black students.</p>
<p>Monday, Brenda Reaves of Lockport performed a living history portrayal of Mossell&rsquo;s wife, Eliza, who is buried in Cold Springs Cemetery. Her husband died in 1908 on a trip to London and is buried there, Linnabery said.</p>
<p>Mossell and his wife were never slaves, Linnabery said. They were originally from Baltimore, but moved to Hamilton, Ont., to keep from being hassled by enforcement of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law. They came to Lockport in 1866.</p>
<p>The Lockport history lesson was among several gatherings that took place over the weekend to honor the civil rights leader on the 25th anniversary of the holiday that honors King.</p>

		<p>So what&rsquo;s the point?  They had some tough times in their lives?<br>
Some people didn&rsquo;t want them around?  Not everyone liked them?<br>
And that only happens to people who happen to be black?  I&rsquo;m an old white man, educated more than most, and I know plenty of people don&rsquo;t want me around.  So I&rsquo;m supposed to make a federal case out of it?  If someone doesn&rsquo;t want this old white man around, I take my money and my opinions somewhere else.  What&rsquo;s the big deal?</p>

<p>And ever since then white society has suffered greatly at the hands of black thugs who disrupt, assault and create chaos, while school officials dumb down the curriculum, hoping that blacks will &#8220;catch up.&#8221; </p>

		<p>And why shouldn&rsquo;t Mr. Mossell want to send his kids to where he knows the best quality education is to be found, particularly if he helped contribute to the school&rsquo;s construction?</p>
<p>Ahhhhh, here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
At the Belle Center on Wyoming Avenue, volunteers from AmeriCorps, Hilbert College and the University at Buffalo were busy throughout the building, which houses VIVE   &mdash;   La Casa, a refugee shelter.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had 40 [to] 50 people here doing volunteer work,&#8221; said Ursula J. Davis, director of operations for the shelter, where 120 refugees are in residence.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Until and unless whites get the chance to work for whites in building an all-white community where our labors are literally ours -to- own and be proud of without being subject to &#8216;ethnic oversight&rsquo; as race guilt, we will always be subject to the spread-the-dependance ethic.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a gift that just never gives back.</p>
<p>Because whites can go it alone without blacks or other groups demanding that they fess up and be charitable.  But the other way around&hellip;not so much.</p>

		<p>First, Lockport is a crime ridden, blue collar, former GM / Harrison Radiator Town, possessing the remnants then Delphi Automotive Group and in 2009 Delphi giving back the Lockport facility to the remnants of GM.  Second, notice the article states 16 students appeared for the MLK celebration in a city of 22,279 (2000 Census).  Third, if The Buffalo News accurately reported this story, MLK is not too popular in Lockport given the fact a city of its size would normally possess well over two thousand school age children.  Bottom line, even in economically depressed Western New York State, behind the political correctness lays a sane and rationale populace.  </p>

		<p> Driving on the Beltway here in DC I was passed by blacks<br>
driving Mercedes, BMWs, Lexus, Escalades..they were all leaving<br>
work at 3:30 in Government jobs..jobs BTW that they cannot perform..and have found all sorts of ways not to have to go<br>
to at all. These same blacks were given college degrees<br>
in phoney majors,  and have been pampered from cradle to grave<br>
with hand outs, pensions, jobs&hellip;and yet if you ask any of them<br>
what does the United States mean to them..they will automatically scream &#8220;Slavery!&#8221;&hellip;&#8221;Racism&#8221;&hellip;.&#8221;Lynchings!&#8221;</p>
<p>Black culture is a psychotic fantasy world and each year it<br>
becomes more malignant and more detached from reality.</p>

So&hellip; they left the (southern) US and went to Canada, but later returned to the (northern) US? I thought the Underground Railroad only sold one-way tickets, I didn&rsquo;t know you could get a return-trip. <br>

		<p>Ahhh, isn&rsquo;t that just sweet. Now, does anyone mind if I told them a little story of my own - well actually a few stories? Now which ones shall I tell? Should it be what happened when blacks took over Detroit? How about the rape, torture and murder of countless White women over the centuries by non-whites? Or how about the non-existent inventions of blacks? OR how about the founding of Haiti?  Oh gee, there is just so many to choose from!<br>
I doubt Ms. Linnabery knows about these historical events.<br>
The only good part of this article was that the Mossells eventually moved OUT of Hamilton - as a Canadian, this is certainly welcome.</p>

		<p>I was fortunate to have been in elementary/middle school in the 50&rsquo; and 60&rsquo;s.  I was taught in the atmosphere of &#8216;shut your mouth and get to work&rsquo; whether it was reading, doing an assignment or listening to the teacher at the board.  I was required to memorize multiplication tables and other standard necessary facts.  Spelling was emphasized, and though I&rsquo;m not perfect at it, I know the difference between to, too and two, and they&rsquo;re, their and there, and your vs. you&rsquo;re.  Spelling those words don&rsquo;t seem to matter anymore.  Fine.  The point I&rsquo;m getting at is, with those tools and others I finally came to the belief that I could teach myself if needed.  I did and still do.  I&rsquo;m not sure some races, cultures, people, can do that and it makes a huge difference in their life-view.</p>

<p>The author overlooks the fact that leading up to desegregation, many blacks and whites both argued for segregation on the basis of preserving white and black culture.  </p>
<p>The argument for segregation when debated at the time balanced the benefits of preserving separate cultures with the rights of blacks to receive equal commercial and public services.</p>

		<p>As decent, law-abiding but WHITE people, we are going to have to fight back. By forcing LIBERAL but well-intentioned fools to understand multi-culturalism is a farce and a sham. We have to spotlight Black crime and dysfunctionality at every opportunity. Which also goes for spotlighting the extensive amount of crimes perpetrated by illegal Latino immigrants. Nor forgetting either, their penchant for causing so much DWI-related carnage on our roads and highways.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Such specious logic!   He didn&rsquo;t  &#8220;contribute&#8221; the bricks, he SOLD them to the Lockport School District.</p>
<p>If he had sold me the bricks with which I built my house, would he be entitled to come and live in it? <br>
____________________</p>
<p>They were not slaves, it says. They were not fleeing slavery. They were well off.  They owned a brickyard and a hotel. Obviously, they arrived in Lockport with capital, as he had not been living and toiling in Lockport all his life. Where did they get the money for these enterprises? It&rsquo;s clear he had not been oppressed and denied opportunity. Evidently he had done quite well in Baltimore.</p>
<p>And he died in 1908 on a trip to London?  In 1908, you could not buy a plane ticket and jet over for the weekend!<br>
Transatlantic travel involved two long ocean voyages, steamer trunks, and heavy expenses.  Travel then was a luxury for the wealthy only. </p>
<p>In other words, these were not poor blacks. And they were never slaves.  No one had oppressed them or kept them down. In fact, they were obviously much better off than the great majority of whites of the time. Are we supposed to feel sorry for them?</p>

		<p>Instead of saying &#8216;they were segregated, that&rsquo;s terrible&rsquo; why doesn&rsquo;t anyone come out and say, &#8216;Yes, but do you want to know why they were?  Do you think it was just out of pure hatred and ignorance?  Can you look at the black community today and think there might a reason why white southerners were segregationists?&rsquo;</p>

<p>This is a good example of the incremental, gnawing approach they have taken over the long term.  Originally, abolition did not imply integration with whites   &mdash;   simply freedom from slavery. Even abolitionists like Lincoln would have been horrified at the suggestion.  Next, blacks received full citizenship, but there was still segregation. Then, the vote, etc. Step by step. </p>
<p>Eventually came integration of the army, utilizing the opportunity  presented by WW2.  (Wars, btw, presented great opportunities for advancing their cause, exploiting the need for national unity and domestic tranquility.)</p>
<p>Even by the time of MLK, when they were intent on pulling down the remains of segregation and integrating the Southern schools, they still  insisted that ALL they wanted was an equal education and equal opportunity, nothing more.  But they had NO interest in sitting next your white daughters, integrated proms, and such. I remember how they scoffed at that suggestion as being ridiculous; even MLK did. </p>
<p>They claimed  to have NO INTEREST whatsoever in miscegenation (the last and inevitable step).  But Southerners intuitively knew better;  they knew where this was leading.  The whole drive for black &#8220;rights&#8221;   &mdash;   from step number one   &mdash;   was towards complete social and sexual integration and ultimate miscegenation of the races. That&rsquo;s where it was going all along   &mdash;   straight to O.J. and Nicole Simpson (and so many others). </p>
<p>I should add that many blacks themselves had no  desire for integration or miscegenation with whites.  They were content to live among their own. Their organizations (like ours) were captured by ideologues with an agenda.  It was certain ideologically committed whites, with their black apostles, who were determined to push it all the way, step by step, just one thing at a time, all the way to miscegenation. All the way to the elimination of whiteness, you could say. It was never so much about getting blacks integrated as about getting whites eliminated. (Sounds extreme? Just check Professor Ignatiev and his project to elminate whiteness.)</p>
<p>The whole black movement was never just about abolition, or integration, or equal rights, or the vote, or citizenship, or education &hellip;. it was about miscegenation and the elimination of white America.</p>

No pictures of Mossell and family?  A shame. I&rsquo;ll wager a pretty penny that they were hardly &#8220;black&#8221; but high yellers.  And incidentally, they would have been highly insulted back then to have been  called &#8220;black&#8221;.</p>

<p>I agree.  The meaning of &#8220;Eyes on the Prize&#8221; was always the idea of a rise to control, and this is well evidenced by the history of black &#8220;advancement&#8221;; The first black in baseball, the first black mayor, the first all black team, the first black president, etc.  The Dream of little &#8220;black boys sitting next to little white girls&#8221; and all that implies is a means to an end.</p>

<p><br>
Eyes on the Prize. Just what does that mean, I ask?  What prize?   Now, there&rsquo;s a good example of their vague, ambiguous mottos, like &#8220;Change you can belive in&#8221; that they love to sling around without getting too explicit. What prize? What change? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see some hard-hitting interviewer on television pin some &#8220;black leader&#8221; down with the question just exactly WHAT &#8220;prize&#8221; are they talking about?&hellip;and then see them squirm.<br>
But, of course, that will never happen.</p>
<p>There was a song, back in the civil rights turmoil of the 60s, (recorded by Ruby and the Romantics) called &#8220;Our Day Will Come&#8221;.  [<i>&#8220;Our day will come, and we&rsquo;ll have everything.  Our day will come, if we just wait a while.&#8221;</i>]  It was ostensibly a love song, but conveyed a hidden, deeper meaning for those who were in tune with the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; message. </p>
<p>This is another example of their double-edged meanings. I&rsquo;d love to see someone pin them down and demand them to be explicit about JUST EXACTLY what they mean.</p>

<p>This is exactly what blacks believe (as you&rsquo;ve told me on many occasions).  Their masters, whose desire it is to destroy White America and Western Civilization, will use black useful idiots to make it so.  It&rsquo;s Win-Win for all! (except for us, but then we are expendable Kulaks, the real target for genocide).</p>

<p>They couldn&rsquo;t have &#8220;achieved&#8221; or &#8220;accomplished anything without <b>a lot</b> of outside help.</p>
<p>Blacks are neither intelligent enough nor organized enough to achieve hegemony over White civilization, coming from a culture, as they did, that didn&rsquo;t have a wheel or a written language.  </p>
<p>White America had to be silenced, pacified and threatened; White complaints deemed as Nazism or Racism for blacks to achieve any type of hegemony over a supremely advanced First World White society.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what happened to White America and is happening now as 0bama&rsquo;s government seeks to further emasculate White America by disarming us and taking over control of the Internet.</p>
