			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Smoking Gun, January 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Prompted by a viral video showing a wild, all-female brawl outside a Florida gas station, cops have launched a probe to identify and possibly arrest the combatants, some of whom had clothing ripped off during the melee.</p>
<p>Detectives believe that the wild fracas outside a RaceTrac gas station in Ocala occurred at about 2:20 AM on December 30, and involved eight &#8220;primary participants,&#8221; according to an Ocala Police Department report. {snip}</p>
<p>Nobody called 911 to report the melee as it unfolded, so cops first learned of the fight when the video appeared on YouTube and other web sites.</p>
<p>A police review of the clip notes that, &#8220;all of the females began striking at one another with open and closed fists.&#8221; As the brawl continued, &#8220;Several of the females involved lose articles of clothing revealing their breasts, buttocks, and genitalia.&#8221; At the video&rsquo;s end, five women are seen &#8220;dancing and yelling as if to celebrate some type of victory. One female even goes as far as standing on the hood of a car as she dances.&#8221;</p>
<p>One battler is so vigorously throwing haymakers that her dress slides up her torso to reveal the woman&rsquo;s thong-adorned rear. Another combatant, who did not fare as well, had her dress nearly ripped off during the confrontation. At the fight&rsquo;s conclusion, the RaceTrac&rsquo;s parking lot is dotted with wigs and hair extensions torn off during the fight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how many brawls like this I have heard about and seen for myself. I remember a group of blacks getting into a brawl in the parking lot of my fathers store back in 1973. A black man was being held by two other black men while a black woman used a sharp knife to &#8220;slice him up.&#8221; His cuts were so bad that he nearly bled to death. I had first aid training so I applied pressure with rags to the worst cuts. The woman doing the &#8220;cutting&#8221; turned out to be his cousin!<br>
I can honestly say that after years of being a police officer and an EMT I never saw whites getting into such large and violent brawls.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a clip in a movie in which several black women were being guided into a police van.  One of them turned to the cop and screamed, &#8220;Just wait till we takover you blue-eyed devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, this video tells us a lot about what would happen if they &#8220;took over.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Anybody want to bet there was a single gainfully-employed black involved in that melee? That would be more interesting, probably, than finding out &#8220;who started it&#8221; or &#8220;who to arrest,&#8221; as if that&rsquo;s going to do any good.</p>
<p> And it&rsquo;s obvious the brawl had to have happened in an all-black area, as no one even bothered to call 911. Just another night in de hood! Wonder what the cause was, or whether the whole thing was just choreographed to give the person with the video camera something to put on YouTube? </p>

<p>AR, keep your ears to the ground for news coming out of Ocala, FL in the next few weeks.  While all the physical action was among the women, and you didn&rsquo;t see any men until later in this clip, I can guarantee you that the women will start gossiping to their men, telling biased &#8220;big fish story&#8221; versions of whatever led to this little melee, each man will hear a different version than the rest, and that&rsquo;s going to get the men mad enough at each other to start taking out at each other, with weapons a little more serious than fists.</p>
<p>I can easily see at least two homicides that are a direct result of this melee.</p>

		<p>Did this happen in Florida, did you say? I&rsquo;m sorry, I thought it was Haiti. Not that far away, I guess.</p>
<p>What struck me was the atmosphere of frivolity that surrounded the whole thing. A couple of males tried to break it up, but for the most part this seemed to be a source of entertainment for most.</p>
<p>Read some of the comments on The Smoking Gun site. Aside from some obligatory tongue-clucking about &#8220;racism,&#8221; a lot of them sound like they could come from Amren, Either people are waking up or they feel a lot freer to comment honestly online, or both.</p>

		<p>This is just disaffected youth blowing off a little steam and attempting to gain a few minutes of fame on Youtube. Girls will do this from time to time after midnight, you know, gather at a gas station and good-heartedly try to rip each other apart. This is performance art by the underclass, reflective of creative expression of the undersocialized in Marion County, otherwise home to the blue-blood equestrian nobility of Florida. I suspect sales will increase nationwide at Race Trac service stations and cheap wig outlets. Note to participants: if your bum is massive, skip the thong.</p>

		<p>As a law enforcement employee, I see this nonsense all the time, usually in smaller groups. Should a cop happen upon this, there will be no &#8216;victim&rsquo; nor assailant. The police were never called on this incident. </p>
<p>This is simply a bunch of lowlifes having fun. One of the old guys at my job schooled me well on such incidents: If they don&rsquo;t call, we don&rsquo;t care. Of course civilized folk would be disturbed and distressed at such antics, but in their world, this was really not that serious. </p>

		<p>It has been a rough couple of weeks for me and I needed a laugh! I could see teenagers of every race participating in brawls like this but after about age 21 unless alcohol or other substances are involved most Whites and Asians are past the brawling age. Even Hispanics tend to stay out of mass fights unless substances or women are involved. This looked to me like a bunch of women fighting over one man- possibly the obese gang banger right out of central casting. The men were all standing around laughing and filming while the women were stripping each other naked very  juvenile behavior if you ask me!</p>

		<p>This looks like an every day fight in a black school!</p>
<p>And I <i>mean</i> every day.</p>
<p>The girls use their long fake nails as weapons and go for their opponent&rsquo;s hair weaves to try to pull them out.  Meanwhile, classrooms empty (there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about black mob mentality) and the hooting and hollering starts.  If either girl has thrown down her purse, it will be long gone (meaning iPods, expensive smart phones and other White-created technology that blacks love so much and, of course, ID and welfare cards) by the time the fight is over, all of it  either destroyed or gone.</p>
<p>All teachers and administrators know that fights between black girls are the absolute worst.  They attack each other with abandon and will not back down; it often takes two or three adults (sometimes more) to bring each girl to the ground and sit on her to get them apart and even then they will fight tooth and nail to get at their opponent.</p>
<p>Both girls will be nail-less, scratched up and bleeding, all hair weaves pulled out by the time it&rsquo;s over.  We know better than to ask what the cause was, it&rsquo;s always over some stupid, trivial matter!</p>
<p>Also, male teachers and administrators are especially vulnerable knowing full well that later they could be accused of child or sexual abuse as they tried to break apart two vicious females.</p>
<p>I no longer break up fights.  And with good reason.  I found out that I am only legally compelled to say &#8220;Stop Fighting!&#8221; to cover myself; I am thankfully not mandated to physically break up students with murderous intentions (lest they band together and turn on me).  My last supervisor told me (and only me) after the last fight I broke up to &#8216;let &#8216;em kill each other.&rsquo;  She didn&rsquo;t want to lose a valuable White teacher (me!).  We are an endangered species these days, most of us are assets to our schools and the administration knows it.  Our White faces are also needed for mandated &#8216;diversity&rsquo; purposes.</p>
<p>My school now calls the city police to break up fights.</p>

		<p>And they wonder why whites don&rsquo;t like to be around them.</p>
<p>And the females wonder why the males don&rsquo;t &#8216;respect&rsquo; them.</p>
<p>And you wonder why virtually no whites own convenience stores anymore.</p>
<p>And you wonder why this hsn&rsquo;t made the lamestream media outside Ocala.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny: nearly every urban area is now a non-white population center, yet ALL urban school districts actively recruit white teachers from anywhere, bypassing their own local &#8216;diverse&rsquo; populations.</p>
<p>I also agree with EVERYTHING you said in your post, as I see it DAILY where I&rsquo;m at.  Black girl fights are so brutal, so cruel.</p>

		<p>16 Shawn:</p>
<p>Re your third line, I can tell you a thing or three about that.  I just got laid off from being the manager of a chain of five gas station/quickie marts for a family concern in the Illinois suburbs of St. Louis.  (The money is in the quickie shops, btw.)  The reason I got laid off is b/c the family sold everything to what I suspect is a Patel operation, and they usually operate by scamming the SBA out of gradually larger and larger SBA loans by constantly buying &#8220;small businesses&#8221; from each other, or by hoodwinking banks using document fraud to garner loans based on their last name being the same.  Part of the reason whites won&rsquo;t own these stores anymore is because white taxpayers are practically paying Indians etc. to buy them from whites.</p>
<p>This melee happened in front of a RaceTrac station.  Those are all company-owned, no franchises.  RaceTrac is a chain based out of Atlanta.  For St. Louisans (and those in certain other cities,) Quik Trip (QT) is the same way   &mdash;   All company owned.  (QT is based in Tulsa.  RaceTrac was founded in St. Louis, ironically.)  AMAF, both QT and RaceTrac both have a lot of stations in Dallas and Atlanta, and many are across the street from each other, or next to each other.</p>
<p>Relevant, because this gas station where the melee took place is company owned, so it wouldn&rsquo;t close down as quickly as it would if it were a franchise operation thanks to the usual suspects.</p>

		<p>This video reminds me of my time at a similar chain convenience location.  Fights and alcohol (liquor store next door&hellip;oi vey)in the adjoining parking lot of an L-shaped minimall, especially Fridays and after school let out.  A nuissance problem that got more serious as loitering brought theft in the store and the disruption outside caused longtime adult customers who spent real money there to warn us they were losing faith in our ability to be a safe point of commerce (gasoline, newspapers, coffee, two numbers&hellip;).</p>
<p>Finally some kid tried to steal a can of chew right out from under my nose as I was counting out the register and the next clerk was coming on.  This same stupid little wretch had had one of his friends create a mess at the Slurpy machine so he could steal a case of wine coolers the week before.  I told the other clerk to go in the back and dial 911 and we nailed the son of an unwed mother, along with all his little punk friends _standing there_ in front of the video games, for the lesser crime.</p>
<p>Come uppance was satisfying as junior looked &#8216;hate you dead!&rsquo; at me and the cuffs spoke louder than his eyes did.</p>
<p>Of course, thank heavens, it was &#8216;a white problem&rsquo; because, had it been black, I would have had to quit rather than walk home 10 blocks every night from work.</p>
<p>Thing is, these were _high school students_, not adults, in East Aurora, Colorado.  So there were a lot of options available and a fair bit of just-dumb-kid hormonal neuroses to lay it off on.  The police were very sympathetic, had a plan they immediately implemented, and only requested that we keep them more in the loop.</p>
<p>Parents were called, rebellious youth made personal apologies for losses we didn&rsquo;t even know about, and about 4 were permanently &#8216;wanted poster at register&rsquo; disallowed from being in the store or a 2 block radius around it.  The police also chained off the side parking lot after the other shops closed and put a substation IN the store for a few weeks (we had them in all the time for free coffee and presence anyway but they had their hands full with this damn school and another store in the same franchise, even closer, so they just didn&rsquo;t know about the &#8216;swing shift&rsquo; teen crowd that had moved over to us).</p>
<p>The point of this story being that I hate to think white kids are acting black because blacks are acting normal and that&rsquo;s what the video brought back nightmares of.  Also, white law enforcement _works_ against white juvenile delinquents who have real parents willing to help their children &#8216;learn about guilt&rsquo;.  And once we did things like remove the video games and set hours on these kids before curfewing them out without adult supervision, things settled down very fast.  Indeed, what was done at our store became defacto policy for all of them in Aurora through a systemic policy of denial-denial-denial:  of congregation points, of age interest attractants and particularly rapid identification and exclusion of instigator personalities.</p>
<p>So why does this &#8216;RaceTrac&rsquo; place not institute a similar policy of tightening up their security before the black act drives off legitimate customers?</p>
<p>Oh&hellip;right.</p>

		<p>#18 QD, thanks for the info; yes, I was aware. It was rather a rhetorical question. I&rsquo;m fully aware of the &#8220;Patel Syndrome&#8221;, which also applies to many motels, dry cleaners and virtually all Dairy Queens, (NONE of which I patronize.) I was simply speaking of the danger (caused almost exclusively by blacks) in working in convenience stores. Being near the Atlanta metro area, I&rsquo;m quite familiar with both RaceTrac and Quik Trip.</p>
