			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hans A. von Spakovsky, FoxNews, January 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics claim that anyone born in the United States is automatically a U.S. citizen, even if their parents are here illegally. But that ignores the text and legislative history of the 14th Amendment, which was ratified in 1868 to extend citizenship to freed slaves and their children.</p>
<p>The 14th Amendment doesn&rsquo;t say that all persons born in the U.S. are citizens. It says that &#8220;[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof&#8221; are citizens. That second, critical, conditional phrase is conveniently ignored or misinterpreted by advocates of &#8220;birthright&#8221; citizenship.</p>
<p>Critics erroneously believe that anyone present in the United States has &#8220;subjected&#8221; himself &#8220;to the jurisdiction&#8221; of the United States, which would extend citizenship to the children of tourists, diplomats, and illegal aliens alike.</p>
<p>But that is not what that qualifying phrase means. Its original meaning refers to the political allegiance of an individual and the jurisdiction that a foreign government has over that individual. The fact that a tourist or illegal alien is subject to our laws and our courts if they violate our laws does not place them within the political &#8220;jurisdiction&#8221; of the United States as that phrase was defined by the framers of the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>This amendment&rsquo;s language was derived from the 1866 Civil Rights Act, which provided that &#8220;[a]ll persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power&#8221; would be considered citizens. Sen. Lyman Trumbull, a key figure in the adoption of the 14th Amendment, said that &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction&#8221; of the U.S. included not owing allegiance to any other country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As John Eastman, former Dean of the Chapman School of Law, has said, many do not seem to understand &#8220;the distinction between partial, territorial jurisdiction, which subjects all who are present within the territory of a sovereign to the jurisdiction of that sovereign&rsquo;s laws, and complete political jurisdiction, which requires allegiance to the sovereign as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the famous Slaughter-House cases of 1872, the Supreme Court stated that this qualifying phrase was intended to exclude &#8220;children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States.&#8221; This was confirmed in 1884 in another case, Elk vs. Wilkins, when citizenship was denied to an American Indian because he &#8220;owed immediate allegiance to&#8221; his tribe and not the United States.</p>
<p>American Indians and their children did not become citizens until Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. {snip}</p>
<p>Even in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, the 1898 case most often cited by &#8220;birthright&#8221; supporters due to its overbroad language, the Court only held that a child born of lawful, permanent residents was a U.S. citizen. That is a far cry from saying that a child born of individuals who are here illegally must be considered a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [The] children born of parents temporarily in the country as students or tourists are {snip} subject to the political jurisdiction (and allegiance) of the country of their parents. The same applies to the children of illegal aliens because children born in the United States to foreign citizens are citizens of their parents&rsquo; home country.</p>
<p>{snip} U.S. immigration law (8 U.S.C. § 1401) simply repeats the language of the 14th Amendment, including the phrase &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction thereof.&#8221; The State Department has erroneously interpreted that statute to provide passports to anyone born in the United States, regardless of whether their parents are here illegally and regardless of whether the applicant meets the requirement of being &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction&#8221; of the U.S. Accordingly, birthright citizenship has been implemented by executive fiat, not because it is required by federal law or the Constitution.</p>

		<p><i>The 14th Amendment doesn&rsquo;t say that all persons born in the U.S. are citizens. It says that &ldquo;[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof&rdquo; are citizens.</i></p>
<p>It seems obvious to me. Why would the amendment even contain the phrase &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&#8221; if it weren&rsquo;t important? </p>
<p>The claim that anyone born in the US is &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction of the US&#8221; is a redundancy. If that were the case, then the 14th amendment would in effect read &#8220;all persons subject to the jurisdiction thereof and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.&#8221; Obvious nonsense.</p>
<p>The left only screams about &#8220;what the Constitution says&#8221; when it supports whatever argument they&rsquo;re trying to make. When it conflicts with their dogma, then it&rsquo;s simply &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

		<p>None of that matters in the slightest.</p>
<p>The US is a COMMUNIST country with on the barest pretense at the rule of law.  We are very close to what is described in George Orwell&rsquo;s book, 1984&hellip;..with the vast majority of people completely ignorant of what the law says and what agents of the law are doing. It&rsquo;s worse some places than others but the entire country is like this to some degree.</p>
<p>What the law says does not matter.  An elite class does whatever it wishes.  If it violates the law, it may or may not be reported.  There may or may not be outrage if it is reported.  Quickly, whatever it is they did, will be washed down the memory hole.</p>
<p>Only the threatened collapse of the entire system has gotten some people to even notice.</p>
<p>Which is the real problem.  This teeny tiny, infinitesimal minority (a literal minority as most of the people involved are non-whites) does whatever it wishes to us and nobody cares or even bothers to notice unless it is happening to them personally (even then&hellip;..many are jobless due to racism but can&rsquo;t be bothered to notice that is the reason).</p>
<p>What is being done is being done by consent.  And it&rsquo;s been that way for a long, long time.</p>

		<p>I know there&rsquo;s much doom-and-gloom on this blog, for good reason.  But this is an AMAZING sign.  The mainstream media is tolerating debate on the &#8220;birthright citizenship&#8221; scam because of OVERWHELMING public opinion.</p>
<p>Ride the wave!  Call your Congressmen and Senators, do what you can.  This is a HUGE issue concerning the browning-out of America.</p>
<p>About ONE in every TEN births is from an illegal, parasitic, mestizo alien from Mexico or one of its savage southern neighbors.</p>

		<p>Very good article. I want to add that people keep saying that the 14 th Amendment grants anyone born in the USA U.S. Citizenship rights and that&rsquo;s it. That that&rsquo;s a fact and nothing can be done about it to change it. Not so fast. What these people read,even the lawyers and members of Congress, is only Section 1 of the Amendment.</p>
<p>Why they don&rsquo;t keep reading until they see what Section 5 of the same Amendment says?</p>
<p>Read below:</p>
<p>Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.</p>
<p><br>
This means that the Ultimate authority rests in the Congress to clarify,modify and legislate and therefore not grant,revoke any Citizenship rights to anyone who is not wanted in this Country.</p>
<p>There is also that question of &#8220;Subject to the Jurisdiction thereof&#8221; which has a substantial meaning otherwise it would not be there!</p>
<p>Obviously, our founding fathers in passing the Amendment were referring to Birth Rights, Citizenship Rights of Caucasians,that is Whites born in the United States of America. Blacks, descendants of slaves had been judged as &#8220;having Jurisdiction where they were born&#8221;, the Native Americans were granted Citizenship later and then there was nobody else.</p>
<p>The 14th Amendment,after all, was not meant,never meant for third world invaders. The Constitution and all the Federal and States Statutes were meant to protect and maintain a White Country for Whites only.</p>
<p>Matter of fact, all the strange-looking people we see all over now, were not here when our founding fathers wrote the 14Th Amendment, and were not expected to ever be here but somehow our bleeding hearts politicians got fooled into passing laws which in the end the only &#8220;good&#8221; they did was to destroy Whites!</p>
<p>Today, through continuous treason perpetrated by Congress and the Federal Courts including the U.S. Supreme Court over the past few decades, Whites have become third class, unwanted citizens.</p>
<p>This is the right time to raise the issue and fix it while we have still the numbers and the power to do it. In the meantime, States should write on the Birth Certificates of children of non-White illegal aliens as follows: &#8220;NOT SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THIS STATE&#8221;. or just refuse to grant any Birth certificates at all telling the applicants to go to their own Consulates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also imperative to stop all non-White immigration. It has to be done. </p>

		<p>Regarding the phrase &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&#8221; let&rsquo;s not forget that Mexico extends citizenship to every child born in the US to Mexican citizens regardless of legal status.  As Calderone reminded us.. where there is a Mexican there is Mexico.</p>
<p>It appears to me that Mexico is claiming &#8216;jurisdiction&rsquo; over these children.</p>

		<p>If Congress will take the time to read the Mexican Contitution they will see that it forbids Mexicans to become citizens of other countries&hellip;and we sure want to obey THAT ruling! I would also like to see dual citizenship stopped. When someone hold that title, where do their loyalties lie? Our 14th amendment can correctly eliminate birthright citizens throught the part about jurisdiction. Neither Mexicans nor others who sneak into our country should ever be rewarded with our most precious birthright and especally the children they come to have. We pay forever for each and every one. It must stop. That will be one less magnet to those who care nothing about being true Americans.</p>

		<p>The intent of a law  &mdash;  not just the words therein  &mdash;  is of prime importance in its interpretation.  And this amendment was meant to grant citizenship to freed slaves  &mdash;  period.</p>

<p>Just to clarify - our Founding Fathers had nothing to do with the 14th Amendment, which was writing after the Civil War.</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers would have probably been against the entire concept of birthright citizenship, since they set the country up for the benefit of &#8220;ourselves and our posterity,&#8221; not for any Third Worlder&rsquo;s we are allowing in today.  They would rightly think we are insane for doing what we are doing.</p>

		<p>I would like to know how far back they plan to go with this?  This issue has been abused for decades, so are we expected to let them stay just because they have already been here for so long?  I don&rsquo;t know who created that construct, but it&rsquo;s moronic.  Why not just invite all of the world&rsquo;s elderly to drain our system?  As illegal border jumpers age, they only cost America more.  For the few who actually did contribute, cash out their Social Security in a lump sum check and give them a bus ticket South.  Mexico has no right to refuse them, besides, they&rsquo;ll be loaded with money!<br>

<p>I agree with what you just said, however, I consider anyone of the original contributors of the first Amendments to the Constitution to be &#8220;our founding fathers&#8221;. It&rsquo;s the way I see it.</p>
<p><br>

<p> <br>
No argument here. Totally agreed. What we&rsquo;re doing, that is what our traitors in Congress are doing is destroying a Divine Creation: The White Race and its unique beauty and greatest civilization. This is called genocide. </p>

		<p>You have to treat this as a crime.  Means, Motive, Opportunity and Outcome.</p>
<p>If the law (and it&rsquo;s debate in Reconstructionist Congress) is so explicit in it&rsquo;s interpretation then you must look at the period when it was first overridden and the -continuing- motive to do, since.  As this requires significant means to overlook the Constitution in a Republic based on it&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>To identify the criminals one must look at not just the methods of the the continuance of that crime (and we are well into RICO territory here).  But also the commensurate payoff for the risk in it&rsquo;s conspiracy of coverup.</p>
<p>If the motive is reduction of this society from the worlds leading financial and industrial power to a multiethnic &#8216;service economy&rsquo;, superceded by other ethnically homogenous, Asian, states; then it cannot be corporate greed alone.</p>
<p>And if it serves to enable multiple hostile ethnies as replacement power structure within the U.S. federalist system, then it cannot be for &#8216;Democrtic Demographics Sake Alone&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Since any company would have long since realized that having no assurance of contract rights as base of operations in a friendly state would make it vulnerable to the winds of convenience, whereever it did undertake operations (as both manufacturing and market share).</p>
<p>While anyone looking to fight the conservative vision by empowering a YOUNG generation of Democrats would have to recognize that war makes strange bedfellows but the hispanic and black caucus&rsquo; were ultimatey as disinclined to white leadership as the Republicans were to social change.</p>
<p>Finally, you have to look at what the outcome will mean, ten years before the trigger is finally pulled.</p>
<p>Whatever conspiracy or force of habit brought us here, it then becomes obvious that the only reason it is &#8216;debatable&rsquo;, now, is that it was _no longer_ &#8216;criminal&rsquo; to discuss it.  As any fait de accompli action where only the criminals will be around to punish themselves.</p>
<p>1/3rd of whites are over 50 and they are losing insurance, Social Security and cost of living assurances to kill off the 60 trillion dollar debt that SS/Medicare/Medicaid represents.</p>
<p>The coming White generation are only at parity with the LATEST in birth cohorts among Hispanics and Blacks.  When our elders of the B1/B2 and Gen-X are all gone, we could easily end up below 30% of this population, even if we win on a 14th Amendment enforcement issue, simply because hispanics and blacks reproduce in the 14-17 range instead of 20-30 like we do.</p>
<p>And once they have a collective majority, everything we do would be reversed, even if we were the majority minority.  They hate us that much.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s assuming the &#8216;powers that be&rsquo; allow such an affront as correct interpretation of the 14th Amendment and Birthright Citizenship repeal to be passed.</p>
<p>The only hope we have is recognizing that this nation (of whites) will be sufficiently smaller in 2020 that it -can- survive as WSM clusters as we never could as disparately spread minority populace, bowling alone.</p>
<p>We can be a survivable Finland, Rhodesia and Brazil.  Provided we band together and stand apart.  Because none of the competing ethnies has a right to say &#8216;we were here first!&rsquo; as function of incursion as they did in Africa and Mexico.</p>
<p>And because we can adjust our work ethics to support ourselves as homogenous gene groups (I will help the father that his daughter might marry my son) rather than our dependent, unwanted, secondary populations, making sacrifices worthwhile.</p>
<p>But we have to start the planning NOW.</p>
<p>Winning on the 14th at this point is bailing the ocean with the lifeboat 3/4s full of sharks and saltwater.</p>
