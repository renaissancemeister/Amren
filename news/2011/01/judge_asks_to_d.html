<p>Chief judge John M. Roll wants permission to delay bringing felons to trial.</p>
<p>&#8220;The addition of what sometimes seems to be an inexhaustible number of law enforcement agents and federal prosecutors in Tucson division has now produced a tsunami of federal felony cases far beyond the management capacity of the four active district judges in Tucson division,&#8221; Roll says in Nov. 24, letter to U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Alex Kozinski.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Judicial resources have not kept pace with the increases in investigative and prosecutorial resources overloading judges, Roll wrote. The number of prosecutors assigned to the criminal division in the Tucson Office of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office has nearly doubled in the past two years from 33 in 2008 to 61 today, the letter says. The buildup of Border Patrol agents in the Tucson Sector to 3,300 today, up from 2,100 in 2004.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without the possibility of relief from a declaration of judicial emergency, Tucson division is simply unable to absorb the enormous increase in felony cases being scheduled for trial while remaining compliant with the time limits set by the Speedy Trial Act,&#8221; Roll wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The situation is acute in Southern Arizona, where there are just five judges assigned. In actuality, there are just four, with a vacancy waiting to be filled.</p>
<p>Roll said the seven judges left in Phoenix  &mdash;  one just was named to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  &mdash;  already are busy and cannot help with the workload. And he said the space in the courthouse is so tight that even when they can get visiting judges, only one can be accommodated at any one time.</p>
<p>Two years ago there were 3,023 felony cases filed in federal court in Arizona. That increased to 4,311 the next year and 5,219 just last year. In just Tucson, felony filings went from 1,564 two years ago to 3,289 last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The number of judges aren&rsquo;t the only problem  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s not enough space in the Evo A. DeConcini Courthouse in Tucson, either, Roll wrote. The courthouse has seven district courtrooms, including a special proceedings room that has been used since January 2008 for the Border Patrol&rsquo;s Operation Streamline initiative. About 16,000 misdemeanor and petty cases are filed annually in this initiative, Roll wrote.</p>
<p>Space limitations at the Tucson courthouse &#8220;pose a significant impediment to the utilization of more than one visiting district judge at a time,&#8221; Roll wrote. &#8220;And due to smaller magistrate judge courtrooms in Tucson, there is no space available for visiting judges to hear trials.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roll said the increase in felony court filings is a natural outgrowth of the fact there are now more than 3,000 Border Patrol officers in the Tucson Sector.</p>

		<p>Judge, all those &#8220;filings&#8221; aren&rsquo;t just paperwork.  Each filing represents a crime or an illegal invader caught breaking the law.  Each represents a crime against the people and State of Arizona.  If you feel you can&rsquo;t handle the workload, STEP DOWN, and let a better man be appointed.  You could also reduce the workload by serving quick justice, refusing to allow endless appeals and motions during pre-trial, and by streamlining the judicial process.  Streamlining does NOT mean making deals, releasing criminals for &#8220;petty crimes&#8221;, or outright refusal to prosecute due to &#8220;work overload&#8221;.  If you really, really, really feel the official justice system cannot handle the flood of criminals for prosecution, feel free to authorize the PEOPLE of Arizona to render justice in the manner of early frontier Arizona.</p>

		<p>True, there might be a shortage of judges, but there is also an overage of cases.  I get the feeling that the lawyers for a lot of these felony defendants (mainly illegal aliens) are having them request trials instead of pleading out, in order to gum up the system, so that the lawyers can file dismissal motions for the lack of a &#8220;speedy trial,&#8221; and/or mouth off for amnesty in the meantime.</p>
<p>The whole state of Arizona is in the 9th Appellate Circuit.  A few years ago, Congressional Republicans wanted to create a new appellate circuit, to include AZ, UT and one other state, mainly to get AZ out of the 9th Circus.  AFAIK, that effort didn&rsquo;t take legs.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Better border patrol and more prosecutors bring a &ldquo;tsunami of federal felony cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the border had been properly guarded all of the last many years there would be no problem with too many court cases and the drug problems this country has right now would have been FAR, FAR, less.</p>
<p>This empire is crumbling.  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time. <br>

		<p>Just imagine how things would be if immigration law had actually been enforced for the past 30 years.  We would not now be at the point where Arizona can&rsquo;t afford to enforce criminal law.  The same federal government that insists it can&rsquo;t afford to control the border still insists it can afford to fight unending foreign wars thousands of miles away.  I don&rsquo;t live in a country.  I live in an insane asylum.</p>

		<p>If the morons in Washington can borrow money from China to keep pouring it down the Iraq rathole and the Afghanistan rathole and all sorts of entitlement ratholes, they can borrow some more money from China and hire a few extra judges.</p>

Writes that motions and appeals should be dismissed. A motion is a plea to either allow some evidence in or get some dismissed. If they begin doing this in Tucson Superior court who is to say it wont be done in Ca,Nv,WA,etc&hellip;.the constitution guarantees All citizens a fair trial and by far they mean the full righ to represent yourself. The appeals process is a joke. Most courts dont lift a finger to overturn a conviction brought by a jury. So spare me the thousands going home on appeal. What needs happen and which is obvious is to send some cases outside their jurisdictions. Hiring more judges simply creates a bigger system -exactly what limited goverment is fighting.</p>
