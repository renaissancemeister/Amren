<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/world/asia/29iht-ghost29.html?_r=1">Thais Look to the Supernatural</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Fuller, New York Times, December 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} This country of 65 million people has embraced modernity, yes, but many Thais will tell you that ghosts and spirits still wander the streets and inhabit buildings. Important business decisions often require consultations with a fortune teller. Cabinet ministers and military officers are sometimes so concerned with numerology and advice from their shamans that politics in Thailand could be called the black art of the possible. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those who might have predicted a few decades ago that the rise of science and technology would eventually blot out Thailand&rsquo;s longstanding preoccupation with the supernatural can walk into one of the country&rsquo;s thousands of 7-Eleven convenience stores. Amulets meant to protect and bring good luck sell next to breath mints. Horoscope books are mixed in with instant noodles and junk food. </p>

		<p>And I thought Thais were the group that Rushton has recently tried to include in his &#8220;high Asian IQ group&#8221;. Give me a break. I become less and less impressed with Asians as time goes on, and yes that includes the Chinese. But Thais and the Vietnamese are by far the two Asian groups that cease to appeal to me, and I highly doubt the high IQs that Rushton likes to assign to them.</p>

		<p>This is related to Feng Shui [feng schway]. The Chinese &#8220;art&#8221;. NO straight lines [channels kill energy], mirrors reflect kill energy, etc. Colors are important to wealth and prosperity, numerology and such. An integral part of Oriental society and culture. We call it superstition, they call it a way of life.</p>

		<p>The only people who can criticise the Thais&rsquo; superstition are athiests. I find their superstition harmless (and they are in Thailand aren&rsquo;t they, so as far as your movement&rsquo;s concerned, you have no quarrel with them) and while I despise a set of beliefs which promise to bring luck in this life, I find religions (and I&rsquo;m not targeting any specific one here) that claim to offer salvation after death even more heinous.<br>
Also keep in mind that Thailand&rsquo;s modernisation is a very recent phenomena, and that it will take quite some time for the superstition of past years to wear off; after all witch burnings in Europe didn&rsquo;t end in a day either (and to their credit the Thais stand among the few Eurasians who have never practised killing in the name of religion (be it lynching witches or human sacrifice)). The Thais are a wonderful people, and anyone who&rsquo;s ever been to Thailand will agree that they rank as one of the most friendly people on the face of the Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thais will tell you that ghosts and spirits still wander the streets and inhabit buildings.&#8221;<br>
Much like the Japanese&hellip; yet they receive a lot more praise on this site than do the Thais.</p>

		<p>To Poster 1- Courtney</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no expert in the field, but I believe Rushton does not &#8220;assign&#8221; IQs, he sources them from a study done by Charles Murray and Richard Hernstein. The reliability of the study, if you wish to take it seriously is a matter you might consider examining.</p>
<p>Less impressed with the Chinese? That&rsquo;s not too hard. In my time in China my opinion of them as a people dropped drastically in my first few months in the country (I was shocked that they were nothing like the Japanese), but I gradually came to admire them for their own unique traits (of which there are too many to fit in one post; but to summarise, its roughly evenly divided between positive and negative) </p>
<p>On this site, we tend to group people through race too much, ignoring the great intra-racial differences that exist. The majority of posters here see &#8220;East Asians&#8221; as a metonym for an orderly, entrepeneurial people with an aversion to creatviity and no sense of humour. But spend some time among different nations within the region and the vast differences between the Thais and Chinese, and the Chinese and Japanese will begin to show. South East Asians are much more likely to smile and laugh, and are in general more naive and less cynical about the world than their Chinese, Japanese and Korean counterparts. They tend to be less driven by greed (or self-improvement if you will) and from much personal experience, there is no way you can tell the difference between a Chinese from Hong Kong and a relatively pale Vietnamese person. Though genetically similar, the differences in character are enormous. </p>
<p>Even within a single East Asian country (China being the obvious example), no generalisations can be made. The people&rsquo;s character are extremely variable; and the nature of the Chinese people changes from province to province. In Shanghai for example, its easy to find proof of the Chinese saying that &#8220;Beijing is a bad city full of good people, Shanghai a good city filled with bad people&#8221;. If you suffer a stroke in Shanghai, don&rsquo;t even expect someone to call an ambulance, but if you suffer one in Beijing expect to be crushed by people accidentally treading on you in the rush to help (my experience only, but quite true in my own opinion). Similarly Sichuan has a remarkable community spirit which shone through during the Earthquake in 2008 and still blazes brightly, but in the adjacent Shaanxi province, it was reported recently that some farmers looted a broken down truck carrying chickens; an incident reported nationwide on state media, forcing the Governor to institute what I think will be a failed &#8220;citizenship program&#8221;.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why I&rsquo;ve gone on a long tangent about differences between Asians as a whole. It is because I wish to stress intra-racial differences exist as well; after all we would not think that there was no difference in the personalities of a Briton, a Spaniard and a Russian, but this awareness disspitaes when we turn our minds to another race. Asians have this lack of diffrentiation too; they consider all Whites, regardless of nationality to be essentially the same, as is their opinuon of Africans.</p>

		<p>I have been a follower of Amren for years now, and I am quite familiar with Rushton&rsquo;s work. It is highly possible for him to fudge his numbers in regards to Asian IQs, and I am not the only person on here who has come up with that speculation. In his older IQ maps he lumps SE Asians separately from East Asians, but recently he has started lumping them in with them, as if people from SE Asia have higher IQs than whites. Most of the data proves otherwise, which shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard for anyone on here to believe, when comparing SE Asian people and their behavior to Europeans.</p>
<p>I am also well aware that Asians are hardly monolithic.  That was my whole point actually.  The Japanese are quite impressive in my opinion, for instance.</p>
<p>In regards to some of the other posts above, this is a website where among many other discussions, people like to discuss and compare the IQ levels between groups.  If some of you find that offensive, then I don&rsquo;t know what you are doing on here. This isn&rsquo;t about hating other people; it is simply about discussing how certain populations are different from whites, and why, perhaps, large numbers of them shouldn&rsquo;t be immigrating here.</p>

		<p>One should examine the percentage of Americans who believe in ESP, UFOs, ghosts, angels, etc before criticizing Thais. Indeed, there are very few people of any nationality who don&rsquo;t believe at least a few silly and irrational things. I&rsquo;m agnostic, but as far as I&rsquo;m concerned people entitled to believe in the supernatural. As long as one doesn&rsquo;t take it to the point of harming others.</p>

<p>Do you really believe we do not consider the differences that exist in other races and ethnicities?  Do you think you&rsquo;re imparting vital data never before considered?  That&rsquo;s really laughable.</p>
<p>Most people assign group similarities on here, which is accurate, and the rest of the world does the same to all other tribes.</p>
<p>Why somebody should feel the need to point out such obvious distinctions is in itself amazing.</p>
<p>Different groups have collective traits, with a few exceptions, and it&rsquo;s correct to say so.  Or should we now qualify every opinion we have with small asides to suit the desire for what some perceive to be accuracy?</p>

<p>Really?  What you&rsquo;re saying is that we should give parity to a scant few people here with the majority of an alien population that believes in things far less likely than UFO&rsquo;s, etc., which, by the way, could very well be a very real possibility, since scientifically it is commonly agreed we are not the only intelligent life in the galaxy.  Too, ESP is a proven fact, at least to some degree, as global governments are presently running &#8220;remote viewing&#8221; experiments.</p>
<p>And when you mention &#8220;angels&#8221; what you really want to do is criticize Christianity don&rsquo;t you? </p>
<p>Your attempts at logic fall far short of the mark.  Let me guess.  If an article is displayed depicting black on white atrocities you will step in with comments claiming whites were guilty of atrocities a hundred years ago as well, thinking you have made everyone more &#8220;broadminded,&#8221; and revealed them as non-thinking bigots, right?</p>
<p>Or are you just another immature shill from the left, thinking your inadequate arguments are going to convert everyone to another way of looking at things?<br>

<p>If you think they don&rsquo;t already do that you&rsquo;re not very well informed about what the real world is all about.</p>
<p>The most bigotted people on the planet are non-whites, with blacks being the most egregious.  If you think that isn&rsquo;t true, how about taking a trip to Mexico and see what they teach in their schools, or sit in Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s church and listen to the sermons there while the blacks applaud and cheer&hellip;.or any one of many black churches that are similar.</p>
<p>You not only make a &#8220;mistake in judgement&#8221; it doesnt appear as if you are aware of what goes on around you.</p>

		<p>It sounds like some of you want to use this as an excuse to attack Christians.  Well, for one thing, 90% of the world&rsquo;s science came out of Europe during a period when Europeans were the most religious (from 1450 to 1950). Any educated person should know that. So Christianity obviously didn&rsquo;t do Europe much harm. What good has the superstitions of Southeast Asia done for the people living there?  </p>
<p>Why are we even discussing this?  The whole point in putting up the article was to show how yet another nonwhite group that tends to immigrate to the United States has ways of life that are alien to our own. Apparently American Renaissance has a large number of followers who think Thai people belong in America. Are you with us or not?   </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t have much of a problem with this superstition.  After all, I have white friends who believe they can &#8220;save&#8221; something called their &#8220;souls&#8221; by practicing ritual cannibalism every Sunday.</p>
<p>In fact perhaps the term &#8220;ritual&#8221; is a bit too soft, as anyone who believes in transubstantiation is commiting genuine cannibalism in their own mind.</p>

		<p>To Poster 9 q:<br>
&#8220;You&rsquo;re right there, since your entire diatribe is obviously pointless.&#8221;</p>
<p>How so? Too many people generalise based on racial archetypes and ignore the enormous differences that exist within a race.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really believe we do not consider the differences that exist in other races and ethnicities?&#8221;</p>
<p>The point is that you don&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t seen a single poster on this site discuss the differences between the French and Americans, or Chinese and Koreans with the possible exception of a poster who discussed the personality of Albanians in relation to their Greek neighbours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you&rsquo;re imparting vital data never before considered?&#8221;</p>
<p>I do. I doubt the fact that the Chinese aren&rsquo;t monolithic or that their culture and personality traits doesn&rsquo;t change as you move from province to province (or even within a single province for that matter) has ever crossed your mind. I doubt that you&rsquo;ve even considered that Europeans could be different in their own way. In your mind, all Whites are (generally) the same, as are all Asians and Africans; a flawed assumption. In China there are East Asians who behave as badly as Hispanics do (or as you would think they do). In Europe, the Albanians which the Greek Nationalists are trying to drive out are White.</p>
<p>You ignore such events and facts of life to satisfy your own personal convictions. I doubt you&rsquo;ve ever been outside your own country and seen the world for what it really is. Were you to have done so, then you would know that your assumption that &#8220;Different groups have collective traits, with a few exceptions&#8221; is almost entirely false. Hardworking and rather cunning may describe the majority of East Asians, but that&rsquo;s about as far as it goes.</p>

&#8220;The stars&#8221; can be studied in my opinion.  I have read the Bible and I think you can look to the stars, motions in the sky, for some things.<br>
I also believe in &#8216;bad vibes&rsquo; and things. I guess Christians would call them signs of the devil.  Dealing in voo-doo and junk can lead to &#8216;evil spirits&rsquo; and sin and such.  I would put the Charismatic Christian speaking in &#8220;tongues&#8221; gibberish in this category.  It is basically African Tribalism along with the singing and dancing in the aisles stuff.   </p>

<p>And why do you consistently become aggressive every single time someone has anything positive to say about Asians? Should we then not suspect that you too might have a motive for trying to portray Asians unfairly, just as you accuse Rushton of doing?

<p>  I&rsquo;ve never believed that religion is central to our racial debate here at American Renaissance. For most of our history, the American South (traditionally the most fundamentalist Christian part of the country) has also been the most racially conscious. It&rsquo;s only been the current, wishy-washy, watered down version of Christianity that has embraced the idiotic pro diversity &#8220;liberation theology&#8221; of the cultural Marxists. I really don&rsquo;t care what a person&rsquo;s religion is as long as they are pro-white, pro-western civilization, and against open door non-white immigration and the creeping Third Worldization of both Europe and the United States. </p>

That&rsquo;s nonsense.  I&rsquo;m not aware of Thais immigrating to America in any noticeable numbers. Nor is anyone here advocating it.   In fact, I&rsquo;ve never met ANY Thai or Thais  here at all. There are plenty of other Asians here, but I&rsquo;ve never met a Thai.  Let&rsquo;s be more careful about our facts and not state things that are not so.  </p>

		<p>Poster 19, the purpose of this website is to preserve the white race.  There is a large group of people on this website who think Asians belong in America, and they aren&rsquo;t doing anything to help our cause.  While Jared Taylor is impressed with certain Asian groups (the Japanese), he has never said they belong in our country.</p>
<p>Why do some of us think Rushton might fudge the numbers?  Well, perhaps he would do it to appear less racist. I and many others in this movement like to question the high Asian IQ argument considering that white people have produced at least quadruple the amount in science that Asians have.  I can understand how the Japanese and Koreans and SOME Chinese people may have slightly higher IQs, but that is as far as it goes.  And even those groups appear to be less innovative. I can&rsquo;t believe anyone on here is even suggesting that Thais are as intelligent as white people are.  Rushton doesn&rsquo;t even say that fully, though it seems he tries to fudge things a bit in some of his IQ maps.</p>
<p>Another reason I am getting irritated is because people above keep saying &#8220;white people are just the same as Thais when it comes to superstition&#8221; by giving flawed examples. In countries like Thailand, everything is pretty much run by superstition&hellip;.same with places like India. I have run into very few white people that believe in palm readings etc&hellip;..but there are people above who want to claim that 90% of whites participate in such behavior. Believing in aliens is a completely different matter. Since the Universe is so vast, who is to say they don&rsquo;t exist? And I have already said my piece on Christianity.</p>
<p>Now I wish to know the motives of the people on here who think Thais are equal to whites in intelligence based on your flawed arguments about how we are equal to them when it comes to superstition.  Do you think they belong in this country?</p>

To Poster 9 q:<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, since your entire diatribe is obviously pointless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>EOI: &#8220;How so? Too many people generalise based on racial archetypes and ignore the enormous differences that exist within a race.&#8221;</p>
<p>ice: Why does that bother you, unless you have a problem with white unity?  Your &#8220;Let&rsquo;s all hold hands, drink a coke and sing in perfect harmony,&#8221; nonsense is suspect at best, for it appears as if you&rsquo;re some do-gooder fool who has gotten us into the racial and economic mess we&rsquo;re in right now.  Or are you just the usual garden variety leftist? </p>
<p>ice: &ldquo;Do you really believe we do not consider the differences that exist in other races and ethnicities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>EOI: &#8220;The point is that you don&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t seen a single poster on this site discuss the differences between the French and Americans, or Chinese and Koreans with the possible exception of a poster who discussed the personality of Albanians in relation to their Greek neighbours.&#8221;</p>
<p>ice: Why is that important to you? But there has been much  <br>
of that over the years.  They&rsquo;re called stereotypes and they&rsquo;re based on actual experiences and observations.  But why do you so fanatically pursue a matter of such little consequence?</p>
<p>ice: &ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;re imparting vital data never before considered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>EOI:  &#8220;I do. I doubt the fact that the Chinese aren&rsquo;t monolithic or that their culture and personality traits doesn&rsquo;t change as you move from province to province (or even within a single province for that matter) has ever crossed your mind. I doubt that you&rsquo;ve even considered that Europeans could be different in their own way. In your mind, all Whites are (generally) the same, as are all Asians and Africans; a flawed assumption. In China there are East Asians who behave as badly as Hispanics do (or as you would think they do). In Europe, the Albanians which the Greek Nationalists are trying to drive out are White.&#8221;</p>
<p>ice:  What is it you really want to say? If you&rsquo;re one of the PC crowd who desperately tries to convince everyone we&rsquo;re all the same under the skin, you don&rsquo;t make a very good case for it.  Your entire rant has a kind of desperate tone to it.  And, yes, there are DEFINITELY generalities between the races.  Only a fool wouldn&rsquo;t recognize it.</p>
<p>EOI: &#8220;You ignore such events and facts of life to satisfy your own personal convictions. I doubt you&rsquo;ve ever been outside your own country and seen the world for what it really is. Were you to have done so, then you would know that your assumption that &ldquo;Different groups have collective traits, with a few exceptions&rdquo; is almost entirely false. Hardworking and rather cunning may describe the majority of East Asians, but that&rsquo;s about as far as it goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>ice:  My, my, my, how desperately you want to try to convince people that we&rsquo;re all the same don&rsquo;t you? You believe race is just a social construct too, don&rsquo;t you?  You&rsquo;re coming up a bit short, old boy.  And, incidentally, I&rsquo;ve been all over the world from Europe to the Middle East to South America and Australia with the US military, and I&rsquo;ve travelled extensively throughout Mexico, Central and South America on business.</p>
<p>PC dogma has been hammered so intensely into your mind you couldn&rsquo;t think objectively if your life depended on it.  Like Pavlov&rsquo;s dog, you salivate at the appropriate time due to your mental conditioning.  Ring the politically correct bell and you salivate politically correct dogma on cue.</p>
<p>Your conditioning has been just as complete as the sect who were hammered into believing they were going to Jupiter on the mothership, and when it didn&rsquo;t show at the appointed time they all committed suicide.</p>
<p>You have a bigotted, narrow focus, but, more importantly, you come across as a tortured soul. Nothing you advocate or criticize is going to make one iota of difference to 98% of the people here no matter how frantically you rave and rant.</p>
<p>You would fit right in on the Daily Kos or Moveon.org.</p>

&#8220;And why do you consistently become aggressive every single time someone has anything positive to say about Asians? Should we then not suspect that you too might have a motive for trying to portray Asians unfairly, just as you accuse Rushton of doing? If you are going to start asking us to distrust people, then why should we trust you and not him?&#8221;</p>
<p>From your other posts I think it can be fairly determined that you wouldn&rsquo;t trust anybody on here no matter if their argument were persuasive and flawlwess, because you come across as an anti-Amren ideologue that has an agenda, but you&rsquo;re not too persuasive so your ideas aren&rsquo;t going anywhere nor will they convince but a scant few to your way of thinking, if anybody at all.</p>
<p>And who on here is asking you to trust them?  Personally, I couldn&rsquo;t care less if you alter your thinking one iota, but I&rsquo;m not going to let your denigrations pass without challenge.</p>
<p>Your efforts amount to what is called &#8220;wasting your time.&#8221;  You&rsquo;re very transparent and not convincing at all. <br>

		<p>#12 The early scientists in Europe had a great problem with christianity, particular catholicism, because they challenged the churchs monopoly on world description. Do I need to mention Girdiano Bruno? He was one among many victims of christiany in Europe. It wasnt until well into the enlightement that christianitys power was finally broken. The current demographic problems in Europe are exacerbated by local christians who always stand up for the migrants. Many of them also marry christian 3rd worlders so that they can immigrate. In the coming pan european civil wars the christians are going to fight on the same side as communists and aliens. </p>

		<p>It sounds like some of you want to use this as an excuse to attack Christians. Well, for one thing, 90% of the world&rsquo;s science came out of Europe during a period when Europeans were the most religious (from 1450 to 1950). - Courtney</p>
<p>You sound like you are crediting Christianity for European scientific achievement.  But European science made strides in spite of the damage to progress by Christianity.  </p>

<p>But mostly your points are transparent and lack credibility to the average Amren poster/reader, because it&rsquo;s obvious you&rsquo;re trying to use trickery and deceit with some dimwitted idea that you alone will create a shift in racial opinions here that are closer to your point of view.

<p>We&rsquo;d be more than happy to break down white I.Q.&rsquo;s by white ethnicity and compare them to anybody you want, like for instance, German/Polish/Italian/Finnish group I.Q. which is in the area of 102-103, compared to Thai and Vietnamese I.Q. which is about 89, along with other Asians.  Plus we will use actual success of other white ethnicities to point out that there is obviously factors in the measure of I.Q.&rsquo;s which are not taken into consideration and should be. </p>
<p>Sorry, but you can&rsquo;t argue with success.</p>

		<p>Anonymous posters 26 and 28 are not only wrong about their assessments on Christianity, but they are also missing the point. If you want evidence for what I am saying, first of all, read Charles Murray&rsquo;s &#8220;Human Accomplishment&#8221;.  Just about any other book I read on the topic of the history of science says the same thing about Christianity as a contributing factor, along with other factors such as the high IQ of whites.</p>
<p>Second of all, even if you are correct, you still haven&rsquo;t answered my other point, that despite all this, Europe didn&rsquo;t seem to have a problem producing most of the world&rsquo;s science. What has Southeast Asia done?  Yet people on here wish to talk as if &#8220;90% of whites read palms, and go to psychics, believe in ghosts&hellip;blah blah blah&#8221;.</p>
<p>To Anonymous poster 27, I have already gone over the evidence with you.  You are obviously on here to be argumentative and to cause trouble, and nothing more. </p>
<p>On top of this, you obviously haven&rsquo;t read my whole argument ; only what you want to read out of it. I never said whites are on top, no ifs, ands, or, buts. I said I have seen maps where he fudges SE Asians into his high Asian IQ group, when the data says otherwise. I have complimented the Japanese a couple of times in my above posts.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t understand your point about dividing up the European IQ  the way I am doing with the Asians.  That right there is another part of Rushton&rsquo;s problem. There are particular European countries that have IQs as high as Japan&rsquo;s and Taiwan&rsquo;s etc&hellip;.(some of the Scandinavian countries for instance), yet Rushton only includes a few Asian countries in his high Asian IQ category (though he tries to extend this to SE Asian groups in some of his maps), while mish mashing every single white country in the world into a monolithic category, which really isn&rsquo;t fair to whites.  Your argument helps me more than it helps yourself.</p>
<p>Seeing that you have already falsely accused me of stuff in your last post, I am now finished discussing this with you.</p>

<p>This depends on which study you are refering to. The scores you list above are from Lynne&rsquo;s and Tatu Vanhanen&rsquo;s book. But overall, each study proves about the same results anyhow. But some studies may give certain white countries higher scores than others etc&hellip;..</p>
<p>The reason I even went into that to begin with in my last post was because the other poster was making a pointless statement about how I should compare Irish IQs to Thai IQs etc&hellip;, when the fact of the matter is that that is what Rushton does anyways. ALL white countries are averaged into one IQ, while the high East Asian IQ only consists of three nationalities, that are more homogeneous and related to each other, than the many white nationalities are.  </p>
<p>And when looking at genetics, perhaps his way is the only way to do it, but I was just trying to show the other poster that his comment was pointless, because the lowest white scores bring down the average white IQ as it is, while SE Asians are kept in their own category, not affecting the high East Asian IQ (of China, the Koreas, and Japan). I am just stating things as they are.</p>
<p>In any case, speaking of a difference of under 10 points or even less than that, isn&rsquo;t that significant of a difference.</p>
<p>And you are focusing on one thing I said in one post, but please look at the overall point I have been making all along. I said above that I acknowledge that East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans), have slightly higher IQs than whites. But as another poster pointed out, how exactly are IQ tests structured, and what sorts of abilities do they favor? Asians may be better at taking tests, but whites are better at discovering, inventing, and impacting the world. Which is more important?</p>
<p>These are all things that are worth debating. It is what intelligent people do (not always accepting what every book says, and questioning things).  And as I said before, I am not alone in this.</p>
<p>But all of this aside, going back to my original point; my original criticism of Rushton was that in SOME of his IQ maps he extends the high East Asian IQ to Southeast Asians, when most of the data says otherwise. When using the same source you use above, Southeast Asians average only 87.</p>
<p>This brings me back to my original point from the start.  Why is it hard to believe that SE Asians are more superstitious than whites when their average IQs are much lower than ours? What is wrong with Amren putting up this article? And I have to laugh at the person above who suggested that there aren&rsquo;t any Thais immigrating to America.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not true.  If they&rsquo;re normed on the same scale, Asians come in at about a 103 average, unless Southeast Asians and others outside Japan, Korea and China are factored in, then their overall average drops below 100.  Whites score higher on the verbal segments of IQ tests, and SOME Asians score higher on the math.</p>
<p>Next &#8220;grouping&#8221; has to be considered which is typical of Asian scores.  They have more around their norm, while whites tend to have large segments within their populations who score distantly high from the group considered average, thus explains the reason for white accomplishment outdistancing Asian success by huge margins.  </p>
<p>There are other factors to consider to get an accurate overview of a people, but it would take more space than we have here to explain it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen those tests before. In fact the 105 score discards all of China&rsquo;s highest scores and assumes their lowest (105), when the vast majority of East Coast Chinese are 108 and above.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have more around their norm,&#8221;</p>
<p>No, they do not. In fact they have the highest standard devations of any group. This has even been shown by all the PISAs where test scores did not hit a &#8220;ceiling&#8221;, the top 5% of Japanese outscore everyone else by quite a lot.</p>

		<p>Anonymous poster 34 (can y&rsquo;all please just pick a name), now it appears in your final post that you are trying to one up ice and I by making things up to suit your argument. At first it was tolerable for me to argue with you, but your last post reveals to me that you don&rsquo;t care about debating things truthfully.</p>
<p>Your comment about the Chinese being of two separate races further apart from each other than the Finns are from the Ethiopians is laughable and down right dishonest.  I have never heard any geneticist state such a thing.</p>
<p>Then in your argument about Asian intelligence, you come up with more whoppers to suit your argument.</p>
<p>I have never heard anywhere that Asians have the highest standard deviation in their intelligence. In fact, I have heard Jared Taylor and Rushton speak at Amren conferences, and they tend to speculate just the opposite&hellip;.that whites have the wider spread, which would explain the glaringly obvious fact that whites have been more creative with their intelligence than Asians have. Asians scoring high on tests has nothing to do with this.</p>
<p>Then you claim that the highest Asian IQs are kept out of the average IQ.  Tell me, why in the world would Rushton do that?  And if you make that argument for Asian IQ, then you have to admit the same is done to white IQ as well.  And the SE Asian IQs you list are a tad bit too high, by the way.</p>
<p>Then you tell ice that Europeans have more achievements simply by luck etc&hellip;&hellip;  So you just got done making fibs up above in order to justify your reasoning as to why Asians are as &#8220;perfect&#8221; as they are, according to you, but you don&rsquo;t allow the same for whites.  So you want to say that everything Asians are good at is definate (and you also exagerate how much better they are at it), but anything whites are good at is just by accident.</p>
<p>And I also noticed how you included abundance of natural resources as another excuse.  As a white person, that insults me!  Europe was the most devoid of natural resources longer than anybody else!!!!!!</p>
<p>Anonymous poster 35, the whole point is that whites have created and discovered more than Asians have throughout history.  Pick up a book that talks about the history of science. I am glad you reminded us that the Asians sailed to Africa while Europe consisted of a bunch of farmers, when the fact of the matter is that Europeans were the first to cross major oceans, while the Asians were coast huggers.</p>

<p>Sailing to Africa is the same as space travel and advanced technology to you?  LOL!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re referring to a theory by an amatuer historian who claims a group of Chinese Muslims sailed to various areas, but the issue is highly disputed. </p>
<p>But true or not it&rsquo;s a moot point anyway, because the Vikings sailed almost the same waters 300 years earlier.</p>

		<p>Harumphty Dumphty, I am glad you are just now butting into the conversation and giving your input on something that was resolved in this discussion a long time ago, and that has nothing to do with what we are discussing at the moment.</p>
<p>I already explained above why I brought all of that up to begin with, and I had a legitimate reason for doing so.  I was trying to figure out where people were coming from when they were claiming that whites are just as superstitious as Thais, which was something that was brought up over and over again above based on flawed reasoning, so of course I thought it was something that needed to be discussed.</p>
<p>And if you were to actually pay attention you would see that the anonymous poster I am currently arguing with seems to think Thais have IQs almost similar to whites.  So it is obviously good that I raised the speculation.</p>

<p>Nobody said it was &#8220;worse,&#8221; just something we don&rsquo;t want to have around us.  Our people settled this country, built it up and made it is what it is today. We have a right to criticize those America/white/Christian haters like you who come on this site in order to complain about the people here or the country in general.</p>
<p>But now it finally comes out that you are NOT from this country, which finally explains a lot more about you.  </p>
<p>If this country and the people are less than others why did you come here?  Doesn&rsquo;t the fact that you or your parents migrated here, because the society you lived in was an obviously failed one, make it clear the land of your ancestors was a failed one?  And if you are so obviously unhappy with what we believe why don&rsquo;t you go home?  </p>

<p>ice:  Well, why not go to Thailand to live so you don&rsquo;t have to put up with us?  We certainly don&rsquo;t want people like you here.  We already have too many people here who are ingrates and would like to take over our country and/or pound us into submission.<br>

<p>It appears to me you are butting into this conversation because of past confrontations that you haven&rsquo;t been able to shake off, or that you haven&rsquo;t gotten an apology over.  This is more a personal matter and an insecurity than you having an actual interest in what we are discussing.

<p>Christian superstition didn&rsquo;t seem to stop Europe from outpouring most of the world&rsquo;s science from 1300 AD onward. I mentioned that before.  What has Thailand done?  </p>
<p>And have you been to Thailand and interviewed every Thai villager that lives there?  How do you know they know more about the world?</p>
<p>Back to Harumphty Dumphty, the reason this article was put up was to show how a group of people live who we don&rsquo;t want living here.  Is that hard to understand?</p>

		<p>Courtney, I submitted a post early on to this thread, purely on the content of the article as I recall, but it wasn&rsquo;t accepted. </p>
<p>But yes, you&rsquo;re correct, the attacks of you and ice have made their mark on me&hellip;you are both now much on my mind, and whenever I&rsquo;m here and see either of you pulling the same nonsense on other posters, I intend to call you on it.</p>
<p>But let me ask you a question that arises out of sincere curiosity. You wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the reason this article was put up was to show how a group of people live who we don&rsquo;t want living here. Is that hard to understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought of Thais as being much of a problem in the U.S., but I may be uninformed.  According to Wiki, they are only .05% of the population. But apparently Somalis are an even smaller % of our population, and Somalis certainly ARE a problem. So I&rsquo;m not going to dismiss &#8220;The Great Thai Threat&#8221; merely on the basis of their relatively small numbers here.</p>
<p>So my first question would be, do you have information that the Thais in our country are much of a problem, either by virtue of just their number, or by their character?</p>
<p>But my main point of curiosity is, would you like to have any tiny fraction at all of American citizens be of non-white origin?</p>
<p>Well let me change that question a bit, since I&rsquo;m not sure of my own answer to it.</p>
<p>Would you like to have any tiny fraction of the permanent residents (ignoring the question of citizenship for the moment) of the U.S. be non-white?</p>
<p>I would. I think it adds something to have a FEW members of different races and cultures living among us, but very few. It&rsquo;s like a seasoning&hellip;I want just enough to bring out more strongly the flavor of the main dish itself, and to add a little something, but not so much that it overpowers the main dish.</p>
<p>I think the 1 in every 2000 Americans who are Thai that we have now is a bit too much&hellip;I would maybe prefer 1 in every 20,000 Americans be Thai, so as to make a little room for a few members of other races as appealing as I find the Thais to be.</p>
<p>At least in my reading about them, I find them appealing. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve actually ever met a Thai.</p>
<p>But I like most of the Mexicans I&rsquo;ve met, and I love visiting Mexico. But when I come back to the U.S. I want to feel like I&rsquo;m in the U.S. and not still in Mexico. I&rsquo;d like even fewer Mexicans than Thais in this country, because on the average, Mexicans present problems that, until I&rsquo;m informed differently, I don&rsquo;t believe Thais present.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely curious what your views are about this sort of thing, Courtney. (And I&rsquo;m not JUST trying to poke a stick in your eye by asking! :) </p>

<p>You have wandered completely off topic again, as regards the story on this thread.  It has to do with Thais and their infatuation with spiritual icons, not anything you personally feel outraged about.</p>
<p>And, when you issue statements like, &#8220;and whenever I&rsquo;m here and see either of you pulling the same nonsense on other posters, I intend to call you on it.&#8221; it amounts to nothing more than childish ranting.</p>

<p>See, it is comments like this that I find confusing and that cause me to draw my conclusions. You find them appealing? But then you admit you don&rsquo;t want too many here.  So which is it?  Do you find them compatible and at the same IQ as us or not?  What do you mean by &#8220;appealing&#8221;?</p>
<p>Yes, of course, I think a sprinkling of people of other races is fine. I have never said otherwise. </p>
<p>I am confused about your post because in one part of it you admit that there are too many Thais in America, but then you insist on pinning me down, getting me to justify why I don&rsquo;t want them here myself.</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make from the start was that this is just an article showing how a nonwhite group that immigrates here is different from us.  Why don&rsquo;t people understand this?  Similar articles are written about other minority groups around the world, no matter how small their numbers are in our country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Courtney, have you ever read, &#8216;Death of a Salesman&rsquo;? Willy Loman&rsquo;s famous and poignant line was:&rsquo;I am liked, but not well-liked.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, now you are just trying to personally attack me. For a minute there I was starting to respect you. How do you know I am not well liked?  Have you taken a personal poll of everybody on here?  I get personal emails all the time from people on here supporting me. In fact, some people I have started friendships with and I talk to them regularly on the phone.</p>
<p>Again, keep your personal problems with me between you and I, and stop trying to speak for everyone else on here, assuming they agree with you in order to make yourself feel better about your own insecurities. That is immature.</p>
<p>By the way, I am done with this discussion too, since it seems to be getting off topic and certain people wish to hurl personal insults of which I don&rsquo;t wish to be a part of. A moderator will shut the thread down if it keeps up, so we might as well stop now. If someone wishes to discuss something further they can send me an email. I will not be visiting this particular article ever again,&hellip;I am through with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pre-emptively to those who are enraged by my light-heartedness in the midst of our war to the death (which it is): Leave me alone. Do your thing, and let me do mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been watching you pursue what appears to be a vendetta against both Ice and Courtney through this thread, and I am going to state flatly that it really is doing you no good, at all. Look, we all: debate, theorize about, and factually support racial views here at AR that are out of the multicultural mainstream. That is what makes the website special and the posters here also (this includes: me, you, Ice, and Courtney too.)</p>
<p>The question that I would like to ask you, with the above in mind, is why needlessly fight amongst ourselves? It only helps our enemies in the long run; that is seriously something to think about.</p>
<p>Look, I have had other posters hound and harass me about certain things here at AR (one in particular, that opposes my belief in God and ending my posts with the phrase: &ldquo;God help us all.&rdquo;) However, despite their vindictiveness and misrepresentations about what I write here, I still try to remain civil with them, or simply ignore them, when they are vilifying me and are off topic. It has gotten old and unproductive, in other words. </p>
<p>Is that how you wished to be perceived here at AR, a vindictive and egotistical semi-troll of sorts?</p>
<p>Just something to consider and all the best to you Harumphty Dumpty,</p>

<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m also kind of curious to find out just who people are underneath their monotone racial ranting. There&rsquo;s no reason this site has to be so stuffy. The few posters I&rsquo;ve come to know personally here are much more interesting in person than they are in their posts. People should feel like they can show a little of their personality on this site without being pounced on for having thoughts, questions, feelings, quirks, etc. that make them more than just rigid ideologues. If people felt like there was room to loosen up a bit on this site, it would be a much more attractive site, with a little human warmth in it to attract newcomers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much influenced in my thoughts about this by my several years experience posting at mainstream knoxnews.com, and comparing my experiences here and my experiences there. Amren is usually much more interesting intellectually, but it feels ice-cold to me. It&rsquo;s like everyone is in uniform and standing at attention here, and doing little more than saluting and saying &#8220;Yes, Sir!&#8221; to the racial ideology and angry &#8220;PC&#8221; style that&rsquo;s acceptable here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exaggerating considerably, but hopefully it makes my point.</p>

<p>ice: John, of course is correct, and he&rsquo;s a VERY perceptive guy, which is understandable since he&rsquo;s a practising psychologist.</p>
<p>Your above flippant remarks are in quite a contrast to your prior posts on here wherein you ran the gamut from claiming to be terrified to lamenting about being attacked to threatening to stop sending people to the site (Although you probably haven&rsquo;t sent anyone here) to declaring you wouldn&rsquo;t go to the Amren conference (Although as far as I can determine from other members you&rsquo;ve never attended even one.)to darkly explaining you want to be left alone to declaring that your entire persona has been one of lightheartedness, right after you called your detractors &#8220;thought police,&#8221;  and made declarations to the effect you were through with Amren and would no longer advise people to come here. </p>
<p>And, within all those erratic statements that were a childish roller coaster of immature emotional rants, you interjected that you were taking it upon yourself to watch us in case we write something that isn&rsquo;t to your satisfaction.  That was after you called us the &#8220;thought police.&#8221;  And prior to that nonsensical, contradictory assertion, you warned those of us who criticized your comments that you would be watching what we said in the future.</p>
<p>Recently above you described your entire persona of:  <br>

<p>Your posts revealed darkness, not lightheartedness, and it&rsquo;s weird to see that you&rsquo;re unaware of your contradictions.</p>
<p>Now that you think no one else will be challenging you, you have done a complete about face to your original lamentation of demanding an apology for being challenged, to one of carefree flippancy. </p>
