			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, January 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Welfare benefits for the children of illegal immigrants cost America&rsquo;s largest county more than $600 million last year, according to a local official keeping tabs on the cost. </p>
<p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich released new statistics this week showing social spending for those families in his county rose to $53 million in November, putting the county government on track to spend more than $600 million on related costs for the year  &mdash;  up from $570 million in 2009. </p>
<p>Antonovich arrived at the estimate by factoring in the cost of food stamps and welfare-style benefits through a state program known as CalWORKS. Combined with public safety costs and health care costs, the official claimed the &#8220;total cost for illegal immigrants to county taxpayers&#8221; was more than $1.6 billion in 2010. </p>
<p>&#8220;Not including the hundreds of millions of dollars for education,&#8221; he said in a statement. </p>
<p>{snip}<br>
Antonovich acknowledges that the children whose benefits he&rsquo;s focusing on are U.S.-born. But he argues that the money is collected by the illegal immigrant parents, putting a painful burden on taxpayers, including those who are legal immigrants. </p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is illegal immigration.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Their parents evidently immigrated here in order to get on social services,&#8221; Antonovich spokesman Tony Bell said. &#8220;We can no longer afford to be HMO to the world.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Please, please keep taxing American Citizens to pay for Mexicans.  We Americans don&rsquo;t care how high you raise taxes, just as long as all the people of Mexico (and India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Korea, Viet Nam, Iraq, etc.) can have a better life.  </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to take a lot higher taxes than we now pay, because believe it or not, there are still over 92 million Mexican who have NOT YET IMMIGRATED to the USA.  Their care is going to cost USA taxpayers a lot.  Add to that all the other Third People who need to come here for a better life.  </p>

		<p>Yes, California is going bankrupt, but we in California don&rsquo;t care.  We are willing to spend as much as it takes to provide a better life for the people of Mexico.  </p>
<p>Also note that poor people in the USA pay no taxes, but instead receive money during tax time through the Earned Income Tax Credit.  That means that only 50% of the population actually pays Federal taxes (mainly those racist white people).  </p>
<p>But we are happy to do so, because the purpose of the USA is to provide for the common good of the people of &hellip; Mexico. </p>

		<p>FoxNews seem to be very sarcastic,<br>
on the original article you can see a picture of lefties brought with buses to protest Arizonas anti-illegal laws. And in the article they clearly show how much taxpayers have to pay for those illegals. </p>

If native-born citizens have difficulty providing for their families on falling American salaries, how do Hispanics support their even larger families on wages that are below the American average?</p>
<p>These people couldn&rsquo;t support themselves here if it wasn&rsquo;t for government programs. End the programs, end their &#8216;entitlement&rsquo;, and they will have to leave. </p>

		<p>The schools are the gateway to the golden land of welfare benefits. Schools qualify for Title 1 funds by the percentage of free or reduced meal applications they get.  You should have seen the full court press at the high school where I teach when there was a possibility that the school might not get enough meal welfare applications to qualify for more Title 1 welfare money.  The &#8216;achievement gap&rsquo; is a black hole for our tax dollars. Consequently, the EFFORT GAP will never be acknowledged. </p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t much better down here in the southern part of the state; in fact in some ways it is worse as we are further along on the death spiral into Third World madness.  We have a whole slew of low g-loaded elected mestizo jerks like mayor &#8220;We Clean Your Toilets!&#8221; VivaLaRaza whose main goal is to import as many destitute, fecund illegal aliens as he can. </p>
<p>Entire cities here are on the brink of insolvency, Los Angeles, just one of many.  All cities in California will eventually fall like dominoes as the tax base is chased out of the state and the parasitic class grows exponentially.</p>
<p>Villaraigosa exemplifies the attitude and mind-set, with rare exception, of the modern California politician.  Changing demographics ensure that Villaraigosas-types will soon be the norm; there is no going back&hellip; Fiscal sanity is in short supply here, just as it is in Mexico.</p>
<p>VivaLaRaza, formerly of the EEOC, MeCHA and ACLU typically stated:</p>
<p><i>There are a lot of benefits to immigration, more benefits than there are, uhh, detriments, uhh, if you will.  In California, uhhh, I think there&rsquo;s, uh, a real sense, uh, that these immigrants, uh, provide a great deal to the economic might of the state.</i></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p><i>You&rsquo;re damn right I&rsquo;m for Latinos and I&rsquo;m proud of that!</i> </p>
<p>He is not intelligent enough to understand Econ 101 (the non-Keynesian variety, that is).  But then, I do not believe VivaLaRaza is in charge of anything, only a figurehead called out to appease the unwashed non-White masses when necessary.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich is a lone voice of sanity, one of the very few left in S. OR N. California.  He&rsquo;ll be out of office soon, replaced by a LaRaza type.  Of this you can be sure.</p>

		<p>The total includes those receiving food stamps and general relief as well as other county-administered aid programs, such as in-home healthcare. The cost   &mdash;   shouldered by the county, state and federal governments   &mdash;   was $334 million a month by the end of last year, according to the latest report by the county&rsquo;s Department of Public Social Services.</p>
<p>$344 a month.</p>

		<p>Cheap wages are NEVER cheap.  Mestizos (&#8220;Mexicans&#8221;) work for peanuts, but if so, how do they pay for everything else?</p>
<p>Well, they don&rsquo;t.  You pay for it.  You, White America.  You pay for the little mestizo children to go to school, eat free lunch and breakfast, get free health care, special scholarships, and then later an undeserved Affirmative Action job.</p>
<p>Big business loves illegal mestizos because then they pay a fraction of the labor costs and YOU, the White American taxpayer, foots the rest of the bill.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned &#8220;negative externalities&#8221; like rape, robbery, murder, assault, theft, vandalism, gangs, disease, or cultural deterioration.</p>

		<p>Re: Peejay&rsquo;s comments-Midgen also got away with an episode of speeding and reckless driving that ended in a collision (in her state-owned vehicle) that wound up costing the taxpayers nearly half a million dollars. Police at the scene determined that she wasn&rsquo;t under the influence of alcohol, but every one knows (in California, anyway) that if the cops suspect you of being under the influence, they&rsquo;ll demand a blood test. Refuse it, and you&rsquo;ve lost your license for a year. I guess she used her famous &#8220;You can&rsquo;t talk to me like that. I&rsquo;m a senator&#8221; line on the cops, eh?

		<p>The annual total cost of feeding, housing, educating, incarcerating and caring for the illegal alien in America is staggering.  The government likes to play those numbers low, rediculously low at about 15 billion dollars.  The real cost is somewhere north of 2-300 billion dollars and perhaps more.  But how can one put a price on a five year old citizen maimed or killed by a drunk mexican?</p>
<p>We have really reached the end of the debt credit line for this country.  Shortly, the 14+ trillion in debt will eat away at the American dream like nothing else other than a nuclear war.  We will never regain our lifestyles that we were used to.  Never.  Our future is indeed bleak yet the Hollywood buffoons, the rich globalists, the banker-hucksters, the liberals, socialists, democrats, communists are all licking their chops over the assumed death of this country.  And they are using the mexican hordes as the blunt instrument to commit genocide of the American people. </p>

		<p>MILO,the insufferable fools on our Supreme Court ruled a number of years ago, that American taxpayers are required to help illegal immigrants despite the fact they are here illegally   &mdash;   the issue being that illegal immigrants&rsquo; children, also illegal aliens, nevertheless had the right to a free public education. Everything spiraled downward from there. With FREE E.R. facility health care for the asking, food stamps and welfare checks paid by our taxes. Forget the bogus claims illegality excludes them from welfare   &mdash;   they use the same fraudulent ID for welfare as they do to get jobs. Plus NO ONE is brave enough to actually question the practice. For fear of being accused of racism.</p>

<p><i>Most Kalifornians don&rsquo;t see this cost.</i></p>
<p>You must not live in California or you are very young.</p>
<p>Let me educate you, as the California taxpayer that I am: </p>
<p><i>California has the highest state sales tax rate in the country, according to a new report on sales and use tax rates.</i></p>
<p><i>California has the highest total taxes on gas of any of the 50 states.</i> </p>
<p><i>Tax Freedom Day is the day when Americans finally have earned enough money to pay off their total tax bill for the year. In 2010, California taxpayers work until April 14 to pay their total tax bill (ranked 7th highest nationally)&hellip; 5 days later than national Tax.</i> </p>
<p><i>Since 2001, California has lost 976,000 jobs overall  &mdash;  not just manufacturing jobs, but all jobs due to excessive taxation and California&rsquo;s aggressive regulatory atmosphere.</i></p>
<p><i>AB32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 mandates cutting greenhouse gas emissions in California by 25 percent by 2020. Enacting the law means virtually assuring that California&rsquo;s energy costs, already among the nation&rsquo;s highest, will climb still higher&hellip;. [T]he legislation seems certain to slow any future recovery in the suffering housing, industrial and warehousing sectors and to make California less competitive with other states.</i></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p><i>1.4 million Californians left the state from 1999-2008.</i></p>
<p>Source:  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/33cpjtr" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/33cpjtr</a></p>
<p>You can be sure the majority of those 1.4 million are from the class which is showered with government benefits.  They are productive taxpayers and business owners, taking California&rsquo;s tax base with them.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell from my vantage point in the schools, destitute Third Worlders are still pouring across the border to escape the anarchy and murder in Mexico, and of course, to collect Free White Money redistributed by politicians.</p>
<p>With an increasing base of non-taxpayers/vs. dwindling taxpayers what do you think is going to happen?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll leave, Milo #25.  They are taught in the schools that this is their land, Whites are colonial occupiers of what they view as theirs (along with your bank account, property and any possessions you may have, they believe this was stolen from them or you attained it by keeping them down).</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t leave, they&rsquo;ll attack.</p>

		<p>We have to use a deliberate BOYCOTT of firms hiring/employing Latinos to make our voices heard. I realize the impossibility of boycotting EVERY business. But if we refuse to patronize fast-food franchises, drive-thru car washes and restaurants, it will be a start. Next time you go to an eatery, if  you see lots of Latino employers, send the restaurant manager a letter a few days later explaining WHY you will no longer patronize the establishment (hiring illegal aliens in preference to American workrs). Tell the manager in the letter you will tell your friends and neighbors why you will no longer patronize that establishment.</p>
<p>We have to use whatever legal tools available to us. Selective Boycotting seemingly a good start.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want these nutcases and illegals and blacks coming to other clean, safe, majority-white areas and bringing their same problems with them. I think the smug leftists that brought on this destruction should have to say in California and live with the mistakes they caused.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is really ironic here is that if you go back to say, the 1960s on, the most liberal and radical people are the ones who came here and set up what we have today.  I would bet that 80% of whites still in California now were not born in California.  And I mean that from teachers and professors to the average dweller.  The majority of California in the 1950s was conservative, more rural and less cosmopolitan.  </p>

		<p>#24 Fed Up &#8220;HOW ABOUT YOU? Are you to proud (or lazy) to mow your own lawn, wash your own car? Or do you indirectly help the damned illegals keep working?&#8221;</p>
<p>The last time I had my house painted I was sold by a white South African refugee who came in the next day with a Mexican crew all ready for work. I thought about firing him, but to whom could I turn? It&rsquo;s the same all over. I got a collection call from India several months ago, and when I was having a problem with my computer several months after that I dialed the 800-number only to learn that I was speaking to someone in the Phillipines.<br>
Just last week I was told by my hairstylist that her husband was in Tunisia setting up a call center.<br>
We&rsquo;ve become reliant of cheap labor in much the same way that Red Indians became reliant on white manufactured goods. It&rsquo;s a never ending struggle to buy American</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll leave, Milo #25. They are taught in the schools that this is their land, Whites are colonial occupiers of what they view as theirs&hellip;<br>
They won&rsquo;t leave, they&rsquo;ll attack.&#8221;&hellip;.BON</p>
<p><br>
I agree that they won&rsquo;t leave. Even without the free goodies, they&rsquo;re still better off here than they were back there. It&rsquo;s very naive to think they&rsquo;re going to go back where they came from.</p>
<p>Whatsmore, if they can&rsquo;t get what they need, they will TAKE what they need. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been taught to think that this country rightfully belongs to them anyway, so they&rsquo;re morally justified in taking what they want.  It&rsquo;s eventually going to come to that.</p>

		<p>And did you realize that the 1.6 BILLION per year that it costs us in LA County to subsidize these illegals - DOES NOT INCLUDE the costs of education????  Add THAT in and you&rsquo;ve got in excess of 2 BILLION dollars per year going down the drain for illegals, and our state is bankrupt!!!!  It has to stop, regardless of who feels what.  Us LA County folk are damn tired of this insanity.</p>

		<p>Good point, SENECA. But your mistake was in not asking appropriate questions: Like what kind of people does the guy employ to do the actual work. Hey, I realize we can&rsquo;t boycott everyone. But damn it, we have to make a decent effort. I urge everyone to refuse to patronize the fast food franchises. Burger Barf, McVomit, Slop-in-the-Box, etc. because the fatcat franchise owners hire illegals who will work cheap. Expect no benefits and accept the idea of contract (temporary) jobs.</p>
<p>The benefits of boycotting the fast-food slop joints? You do strike out against illegal immigration, if even in only a small way. The food you prepare yourself being healthier given the Mexican immigrants noted lack of sanitation and little interest in personal cleanliness.</p>

		<p>to olewhitelady&hellip;if milk goes to $10 a gallon people getting food stamps will then be given more food stamps.  Here in NYC when the recession hit I know of someone who was getting $65 and when the recession began started getting $200.  I think from the stimulus funds.     </p>
