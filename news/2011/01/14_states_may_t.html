<h1>14 States May Target Birthright Citizenship</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liz Goodwin, The Lookout (Yahoo! News), January 3, 201</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lawmakers in at least 14 states have said they are committed to passing the legislation targeting birthright citizenship. Arizona&rsquo;s anti-illegal-immigrant bill, SB-1070, was also based on model legislation that could be easily copied by states, and at least seven states are likely to pass bills similar to the first Arizona immigration overhaul this year, according to one analysis by an immigrants rights group.</p>
<p>Arizona state Senator Russell Pearce will unveil the bill Jan. 5 in Washington, D.C., the Arizona Capital Times reports. The paper says lawmakers in Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Utah have said they want to introduce similar legislation this year.</p>
<p>Pearce argues that the &#8220;original intent&#8221; of the 14th Amendment was to grant citizenship to freed U.S. slaves, and that it was never meant to apply to the children of foreigners. A Phoenix New Times writer, however, argues that lawmakers who originally passed the amendment took into account the cases of children of Chinese immigrants in California as well as children of gypsies when drafting the measure. A 19th-century Supreme Court precedent also backs that interpretation, though no Supreme Court case has yet dealt with the issue of offspring of illegal immigrant parents.</p>

		<p>I just wrote an LTE about how denying citizenship to the children of illegal aliens is not a punishment. I suggested that by sending anchor babies back to mexico with all the free education we gave them would help mexico be a better place. I think anyone who thinks that having to live in mexico is a punishment is a racist. I mean mexico is full of mexicans.So if it is a punishment to live there why would we want them here.</p>

		<p>It should be a felony to sign the birth certificate if the parents can&rsquo;t prove beyond a doubt that they are lawful U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Once hospitals and doctors are risking their licenses, they&rsquo;ll stop providing the paperwork. </p>
<p>Babies born to visiting Koreans, Turks, Chinese or Mexicans get automatic citizenship when they return to their homelands.</p>

		<p>Sharing below a superb encapsulation of the intent of the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s Citizenship Clause   &mdash;  - posted by an anonymous source at the online edition of local paper:</p>
<p>&#8220;In borrowing the scholarship of Edward J. Erler, professor of political science, California State University, let me explain. There are two components to American citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment: 1) birth or naturalization in the U.S. and 2) being subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. In 1868, the phrase &ldquo;subject to the jurisdiction&rdquo; meant owing exclusive political allegiance to the U.S. &mdash; which is not the case with illegal aliens. Indeed, Senator Jacob Howard of Ohio, the author of the citizenship clause, assured senate colleagues that the new language was not intended to give birthright citizenship to &#8216;persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, [or] who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, there is no Supreme Court decision squarely holding that children of illegal aliens are automatically citizens of the U.S. An 1898 decision, U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, held by a vote of 5-4 that a child of LEGAL resident aliens is entitled to birthright citizenship. Some constitutional scholars think that the Wong Kim Ark case went too far. But to say that children of illegal aliens are entitled to citizenship is entirely different because their parents are here without permission. Thus, repeal of the current &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; policy should not require a constitutional amendment. N.C. Republican representatives are among the 95 or so cosponsors of HR 1868 which is gathering steam with the recent election results. We need the Democrats also to step forward for a sane naturalization and immigration policy.&#8221;<br>

		<p>How can a person be an &#8216;illegal alien&rsquo; if they are NOT &#8216;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Persons enjoying diplomatic immunity are the only ones not &#8216;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&rsquo; under diplomatic immunity. That means they cannot be prosecuted for crimes committed on US soil. Nor can they be held liable in US civil courts.</p>
<p>If/when a 14th amendment challenge case does go before the US Supreme Court, it&rsquo;s hard to fathom how they can get around the obvious - an &#8216;illegal alien&rsquo; is illegal precisely because he/she is subject to US jurisdiction. Otherwise, they couldn&rsquo;t be prosecuted for crimes committed on US soil - or sued in US courts.<br>

		<p>Maybe if they work in coalition, this thing can get smacked down by whatever Federal Circus of Appeals applies often enough to warrant fast-track consideration by SCOTUS.</p>
<p>If you assume that&rsquo;s a good idea, I have some swampland in Florida that might interest you too.</p>
<p>I have a bad feeling that the best we can expect out of this is heightened awareness of the costs of welfare transfer payments and if what I see out of the NIA is true, it&rsquo;s too late to do more than bolt the door after the horse has left the barn.</p>
<p>IMO, we would be better off making a direct attack on the legality and economic efficacy of HUD, DOEd and DOE as well as the military in the hopes of killing &#8216;supplementals&rsquo; (60 billion a year for the three most useless Federal Agencies and a 388 billion a year Fighter Program that will not survive 2012) so that we can FINALLY build a Real Fence.</p>
<p>A nation that will not defend it&rsquo;s borders cannot conserve it&rsquo;s genes or the economic system that benefits them.</p>

		<p>As a resident of Florida I&rsquo;m sad to see that my state isn&rsquo;t on the list. It really, really should be. Illegal immigration is a big problem in southern Florida. But I&rsquo;m not surprised. We have an entrenched collective of Cubans who would fight this kind of legislation tooth and nail. But the majority of our state&rsquo;s residents are legal. Hopefully something like this will be introduced here in the near future. I think part of southern Florida&rsquo;s problem is that it&rsquo;s a major drug import area. It definitely has one of the highest amount of illegal pill clinics in the country. Too many bribes. The politicians get paid off. Corruption extends from our school boards through law enforcement agencies and higher up. Too many Cubans make up our political hierarchy. Just some of the reasons Florida didn&rsquo;t make the list.</p>

<p>Judging from the composition of the Roberts Court, the issue will probably be dealt with in favor of the illegal immigrant parents. I&rsquo;m sure that Sotomayor has been dying to add her 2 cents.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised to see Texas among the list of those who hope to correct the misinterpreted 14th amendment. Governor Perry sits in his office in a sanctuary city and says that &#8220;Arizona&rsquo;s laws are not for Texas.&#8221; The rest of us think they are, Governor. We would welcome them. How about asking us?</p>

<p>No doubt, especially since Sotomayor loathes our Constitution since there were no &#8220;wise latinas&#8221; around at the time to help our Founders construct the document.<br>
I&rsquo;m sure she would be perfectly fine with dismantling the entire document it and replacing it with a &#8220;wise latina&#8221; perspective. I don&rsquo;t have to tell you or anyone else what that means!<br>

		<p>Anonymous 4 - you are applying a simplistic and wrong interpretation of subject to the jurisdiction thereof.  For example, accredited diplomats ARE NOT prosecuted for crimes in their host country, by international agreement.  By treaty.  Off the books spies ARE prosecuted for any crime in the host country BY the host country because they do NOT have diplomatic accreditation.  Whether they are in the host country with a visa, or if they sneaked across the border of that country.  In the latter case, they are often simply shot (executed) as spies in many countries.  As for the illegal aliens, they are here ILLEGALLY.  They still owe allegiance to their mother country.  They have NOT avowed allegiance to America nor renounced their allegiance to Mexico (or wherever).  They have NOT gone through the legal immigration process.  And though legal immigrants have not as yet renounced their citizenship in their home country until naturalized, they CAN be prosecuted under our laws, AND THEY CAN BE DEPORTED AFTER THEIR JAIL TERMS.  As for their children born while here legally, unfortunately they are US citizens even if the parents had not become citizens of the US.  BUT, the criminal offender can still be deported even if he has a child who IS a US citizen.  If the family wants to stay together, they have to self deport.  Your logic is faulty.  Being subject to criminal prosecution while in another country has NOTHING to do with citizenship OR the granting of birthright citizenship.  Babies born to people here by deception or illegally do NOT have a right to US citizenship.  The law we argue about WAS intended to grant citizenship to a group of people who were born in America and were considered PROPERTY prior to the law.  Property does not have citizenship rights.  People do.  The blacks were brought here by US.  Americans.  The illegal immigrants come here unbidden, illegally, against our laws, and once here break more laws through welfare fraud, stolen identities, theft of services, at the very least.  Too often, they also commit far more serious felonies.  There is the difference.  Blacks and chinese were imported legally (at the time).  Mexicans and latin Americans sneaking across our borders are here ILLEGALLY.  They have no rights any more than the spies we sent into Soviet Russia on the sly.  And they should be treated the same way.</p>

		<p>Has any amendment been more mis-interpreted than the 14th?  (Well, yes, the First Amendment ((Flag burning as speech)) and the Second ((misinterpreted as disallowing an individual right to fire arms)), and the non-existent <i>Right to Privacy</i> to allow a &#8216;right&rsquo; to an abortion.</p>
<p>The <b>author</b> of the citizenship clause, Sen. Jacob M. Howard (MI) expounded on the meaning of the 14th amendment to tell us exactly what it means as he introduced it to the United States Senate in 1866:</p>
<p>Here are his own words:</p>
<p><i>Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United States. This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons.</i></p>
<p>The framers of the 14th amendment clearly believed that US Citizenship was not to be given away to anyone who happened to be born on US soil.</p>
<p>Rep. John Bingham of Ohio, considered the father of the Fourteenth Amendment, confirms the understanding and construction the framers used in regards to birthright and jurisdiction:</p>
<p><i>born within the jurisdiction of the United States of parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty is, in the language of your Constitution itself, a natural born citizen</i></p>
<p>If the birth parents ARE citizens of the US they would not be subjected to deportation, as they are as illegals.  </p>
<p>Of course, modern (re)-interpretations of The Constitution and certain members of SCOTUS injecting their own &#8216;feelings&rsquo; into settled law are a very different and serious matter.  The new congress will have a tough fight on its hands on this matter, one they will probably lose.</p>
<p><i>Those who acquire the rights of citizenship, without adding to the strength or wealth of the community are not the people we are in want of.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  James Madison on Rule of Naturalization, 1st Congress, Feb. 3, 1790.</p>
<p>But Madison is an Old White Dead Man according to the new, improved CW (and school curricula) so his words mean nothing in new AmeriKa where everyone is equal, some more than others.</p>
<p>How soon before the Constitution is declared subversive and the government demands that all copies be burned? </p>

Even if you support amnesty, how can you support universal citizenship? We have to discriminate at some level to still even be considered a nation. <br>
