<h1>Camden, NJ Braces for Deep Police, Fire Cuts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Geoff Mulvihill, GOPUSA, January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Deep layoffs of city workers go into effect on Tuesday  &mdash;  cutting up to 383 jobs, or one-fourth of the city&rsquo;s employees.</p>
<p>The exact number depends on whether public workers&rsquo; unions make last-minute concessions. In any case, the cuts are likely to be deep  &mdash;  and could be a blow to the quality of life in a city where more than half the 80,000 residents, mostly black and Hispanic, live in poverty.</p>
<p>Worst case, the layoffs could slash half the police force and one-third of the fire department for this city just across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. Practically every other job in the city is likely to be affected.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Camden, rampant with open drug-dealing, prostitution and related crimes, was the nation&rsquo;s second-most-dangerous city based on 2009 data, according to CQ Press, which compiles such rankings. Camden ranked first the previous two years. The FBI said that in 2009, the city had 2,380 violent crimes per 100,000 residents  &mdash;  more than five times the national average.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A police union, meanwhile, took out a full page advertisement last week in the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill, warning that Camden would become a &#8220;living hell&#8221; if layoffs were not averted. Unions have been meeting with city officials, but no job-saving deals have been announced so far.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the struggling cities like Camden that could bear the worst of the fallout from the Great Recession as governments at all levels slash costs. Congress has signaled that it will allocate less money to states. And New Jersey, facing its own fiscal crisis, has begun cutting how much money it gives to cities. Camden, where 80 percent of the budget in recent years has come from the state, has the most to lose.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Camden was afflicted by race rioting in the 1970s, decades of losing middle-class residents to the suburbs, and an epidemic of drug-related violence. The schools have been partially under state control.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Camden received $121 million in state aid for fiscal 2010; it currently gets $115.6 million, of which $17 million is being withheld by the state until the city demonstrates that it&rsquo;s complying with reform promises.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than half of what Camden gets from the state is in so-called &#8220;transitional aid&#8221; subsidies to force more self-sufficiency. Republican Gov. Chris Christie says he wants to phase that out.</p>

		<p>Camden, NJ, is not a very safe place to begin with, so you can imagine the havoc that is going to occur when the cuts take place.  However, the answer in Camden, as it will be in most cities, is not to count solely on the police but on volunteer militia groups with a public presence.</p>
<p>But we have not evolved to this stage of the game yet.</p>

		<p> Like so many predominantly black cities   &mdash;   throw in some Hispanics, too, for this one   &mdash;   Camden is a permanent basket case. Detroit, St. Louis, Newark, Compton, CA, New Orleans   &mdash;   you name it, and if it&rsquo;s mostly black I guarantee it will have endemic poverty, rampant crime and drug trafficking, jobs and Whites which have gone a-glimmering, and politicians who mainly want to line their own pockets.</p>
<p> What&rsquo;s the solution? Maybe there isn&rsquo;t any. Maybe like the Great Auk and the Dodo Bird, these cities will just gradually become extinct. They&rsquo;re well on the way now, with miles and miles of boarded-up houses. Would it be a loss? Not in my book!</p>

		<p>On Fox&rsquo;s Willis Report today it was reported that government pensions amount to a 2 trillion dollar mandate that can&rsquo;t be met on the state, city, county levels.</p>
<p>Those of us with experience know that attractive pensions to government workers, especially police, were put in place to minimize corruption and ensure honesty.</p>
<p>Downsizing police forces drastically, plus reducing or taking away pensions is going to create an atmosphere of corruption in this country similar to what Mexico is enduring.  Bribes have to be paid to police there for just travelling from one point to another in some instances.</p>
<p>Sorry to have to say so, but this empire is fading fast.</p>

		<p>In a related story, a state arbitrator awarded Asbury Park policemen raises going back three years, while knowing Asbury Park is broke and will have to have layoffs to offset his ruling. The layoff notices have already gone out. We never let reason or logic get in the way of things here in N.J.</p>

		<p>Seven people, three of them with &#8216;Police and Fire&rsquo; multihats.  One white, too fat to chase down a felon if she needed to &#8216;fill in&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I would suggest if anyone has to go, it should be the redundant positions on the City Council and indeed overall City Government.</p>
<p>Starting with this guy-</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/jY9VM</p>
<p>If the governor can get by with 1$ a year, it&rsquo;s time for other positions to be consolidated, irrespective of &#8216;private industry&rsquo; wage standards.</p>
<p>Of course, since that will never happen, the next step is to start looking at hiring private cops in armored patrol vehicles with guaranteed coverage on minutes-per-mile basis.  Instituting arrest based bonuses for major crimes and putting the city under a curfew status in those areas which contribute most heavily to the 2,380 per 100K crime index.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also reinstitute the death penalty and a maximum 2 appeal, 2 year delay process.  Nothing says &#8220;We&rsquo;re broke!&#8221; like the refusal to send someone away for 10+ at 40,000 dollars a year when you can just kill him and be done.</p>

<p>They are laying off the white officers and firement so later this year they can hire blacks.  The Black Mayor will state that a mistake was made and now a secret lottery will be used to find 200 new police and firemen.  This trick is being used around the nation and whites are too guilt ridden to even think about it.</p>

		<p>I note in the original article, that a Howard Gillette is blaming the new governor, Chris Christie for Camden&rsquo;s woes. Then, in the next sentence Gillette admits Camden, NJ cannot pull itself up by the bootstraps. Now, why is that? Something to do with demographics, maybe?</p>
<p>Hallelujah! We here at Amren have known for a long time, that Bantus cannot pull themselves up by their bootstraps, without some form of federal largesse or intervention. Now this Gillette (I take it he&rsquo;s Bantu) is openly admitting same.</p>
<p>Camden has long promulgated gun control for its citizens, saying their police would protect them. Guess what? When there are no police, who will protect you? Camden will be the East St. Louis of the East Coast, in short order, if it isn&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p>Camden will look like Los Angeles during the Rodney King riots or New Orleans during Katrina. It had a high crime rate with a full police force, so imagine what it&rsquo;ll be when they&rsquo;re laid off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet those people who turned in their guns to their churches, in return for free sneakers or $ 50 gift cards will rue their decision.</p>

		<p>As all proper thinking people know, the police are the problem. Listen to any rap song, civil rights leader, academic or politician. They see clearly. Why the way the white policemen racially profile nice law-abiding black people! And the police brutality. And the assumption that any proud black man with an attitude is a criminal!</p>
<p>Now that the police are out of the way (mostly) we will finally see the proud black man get some rights. Glad to see the burden of racism is being lifted slightly. Get ready to see a true Camden miracle.</p>

		<p>The function of Camden city is the place to where poor, violent humans can be deported and detained.  It is one large reservation.  Like prison, it pays its own way by keeping bad people off the streets of good communities. The rest of South Jersey - Cherry Hill, Voorhees, Morestown, are very nice places to live. As long as Camden city can remain the cloaca maxima for this part of the country, they will continue to be nice places in South Jersey for everyone else to live.  I don&rsquo;t see the problem here.</p>

		<p>@Art of NC,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think civil militias (aka vigilante groups) will work well now as they did in the old West when membership was selective, mutually approved by elders in good standing in small cities, and able to respond to a much lower incidence of specific rather than general crime amongst an ethnically homogenous group.</p>
<p>Victim enablement industries also didn&rsquo;t make every little flawed mistake in a contigency situation into a microscoped criminal or civil litigation.  Because the folks knew who the bad guys were and were glad that they were gone, more than that details of their arrest procedure were properly observed.</p>
<p>I would also suggest that people had a lot more respect for firearms and numbers when they couldn&rsquo;t shoot back with 8-12 in a pistol magazine or 20-30 in a rifle, possibly as autofire, of their own.</p>
<p>There is no reason to assume blacks and hispanics haven&rsquo;t stockpiled a similar arsenal of weapons to what any white group might achieve and through their criminal gang affiliations, they might actually have more.</p>
<p>In a densely urbanized condition, you need to be able to pursue crooks from one ethnic area to another, facing tens if not hundreds of hostiles, firing from defilade behind hardened obstacles.</p>
<p>And you need to do it under armor and with right to use graded force (ADS, gas, rubber bullets, lethal) as a &#8216;licensed&rsquo; unsueable and/or well insured, guarantor of municipal or state level security.</p>
<p>Investing some money in a small, professionally trained, force and giving them minimum wage plus a felony arrest bonus would go a long ways towards making law enforcement pay enough to make crime a low margins endeavor.</p>
<p>Cops will return when crime gets bad enough.  It&rsquo;s not their numbers but their cost:effectiveness which needs improving.</p>

		<p>Sorry for being repetitive, but I have to state here what I stated a few weeks ago when another New Jersey city wanted to make deep cuts in its police forces, and various civic leaders were worried about a spike in violent crime:</p>
<p>It might just be me and my arrogant self, but I haven&rsquo;t found that not murdering, not raping, not robbing, not burglarizing, not committing arson and not stealing cars gets harder in the absence of a cop.  In other and more sarcastic words, I have had to do everything I can to resist the temptation to run out and murder, rob, rape someone, steal their cars and burglarize and burn their homes during the scant 99.9999% of the time that I&rsquo;m not under the direct physical observation of a law enforcement officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doing the right thing&#8221; means doing it while nobody (especially nobody who can punish you) is looking.  If people in Camden and Newark can&rsquo;t &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; with police forces half of what they were last year, then they were hopeless all along, and will always be hopeless even with all the cops in the world.</p>

Well, I see it.  Ways will be found to get around this impasse.  The ultimate result will be to mesh all of these formerly independent communities into one, vast, overall urban unit in which all taxes, education, and responsibilities will be shared. You won&rsquo;t get away, Whitey! </p>
<p>Toronto has already done something like that   &mdash;   incorporating all the land around it into a huge urban area. Thus, there will be no white flight or any separate white communities to escape to. I see that coming as the next step here. Just a matter of time.</p>

<p>One more illustration of the lesson that there is no luxury so expensive as &#8220;cheap labor&#8221;!</p>
<p>The only catch is that those who bring in and benefit from that &#8220;cheap labor&#8221; don&rsquo;t have to pay for it.  The inevitable costs are passed on to the overall population, and all society pays while only a few profit.<br>

		<p>The region around Camden is changing demographically. Lot of Latinos moving in,and a big Mexican population now. The area is fast loosing any rural characteristics, though some farming is still done near Hammonton, NJ. It won&rsquo;t be long before those blueberry fields are gone, gone, gone.  It must have been so nice in the early 20th century, when it was rural and white. The nearest city is Philadelphia, we call it Killadelphia, because the nightly news if full of murders and other violent crimes. We had to go into Camden once, and we saw entire sections of what was once an older, late 19th century urban neighborhood torn down. That is probably the best thing that can happen. Tear down these places, let the people who destroyed it go elsewhere. We will rebuild our cities again someday.</p>
