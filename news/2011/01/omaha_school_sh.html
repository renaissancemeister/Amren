			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Caulfield, New York Daily News, January 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Omaha student who went on a shooting rampage at his high school Wednesday posted a chilling message on Facebook warning of the attack and blaming the school for driving him to violence.</p>
<p>Robert Butler Jr., 17, burst into an office at Millard South High School in Omaha during school hours and fired four to five shots, striking the assistant principal and the principal before fleeing in his car and eventually committing suicide about a mile from the school, Omaha police said.</p>
<p>Assistant Principal Vicki Kaspar, 58, died at a hospital hours later. The principal, Curtis Case, 45, was reported in serious but stable condition.</p>
<p>No students were injured in the shooting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to several media reports, the post read:</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody that used to know me I&rsquo;m [sorry] but Omaha changed me and [expletive] me up. and the school I attend is even worse ur gonna here about the evil [expletive] I did but that [expletive] school drove me to this. I wont u guys to remember me for who I was b4 this ik. I greatly affected the lives of the families ruined but I&rsquo;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Butler signed off the post with an ominous &#8220;goodbye.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Black on white shootings like this will only increase fear and suspicion among whites towards blacks and non-whites in general. Racially motivated murders against whites are  all the reason I need to be armed, to carry weapons  and sleep with a loaded gun in easy reach. We have to be prepared to use them and face the music afterwards for having the temerity to defend ourselves and our loved ones from bodily harm or death. I&rsquo;m already no match for 18 or 21-year old yoofs who might outweigh me by 80 or 100 pounds, who are two cowardly to fight a middle aged man like me one on one. Clearly this guy was more than a few fries short of a Happy Meal, and most likely he stole the gun he used to kill two people before killing himself like the coward he is.</p>

		<p>Just read this on AOL, and you wouldn&rsquo;t imagine how many times a certain racial term for the student has been allowed for commenting, bet the comment will be shut down as soon as my comment reaches these boards. <br>
This story is just sad, the photos above say it all&hellip;maybe the school was too white for him since both principals were white. Maybe he turned to violence cause the previous school didn&rsquo;t have enough to fill his inner desires. I also read he was suspended for driving through the field at the school, which totally erases the innocent imagine of the boys photo (Nice try media!)</p>
<p>How much should we bet this was an affirmative action student? White principals usually mean a white school&hellip;but whether he commited suicide or not&hellip;it wouldn&rsquo;t be a hate crime because the media will feel sorry for the white school turning him to violence.</p>
<p>Lets see how the media tries to erase this story as quickly as they can! My prayers go out to the family of the victims. <br>

		<p>Often, liberals embloy the tactic of attacking white america by insuating that only white teens are deranged (ie. Columbine) .  My favorite is the idea of the &#8220;white only&#8221; serial killer club. The fact this child wasn&rsquo;t white will be the reason that they will forget this story. It doesn&rsquo;t bode well for their narrative.</p>

Funny, I watched this story on the evening news and there were no INTERNET or yearbook photos of the suspect. It must have been an oversight.</p>
<p>There were lots of video of white parents and white students. I was left with the distinct impression the shooter, Robert Butler Jr, was white. You know, white school, white perpetrator. <br>

		<p> As usual, the controlled media used this tragedy as a cause célèbre for increased gun control. Of course, any racial aspect was completely ignored. The vulture media follows the same pattern in formerly Great Britain &mdash; the &ldquo;model&rdquo; for gun control among liberals in the United States. </p>

		<p>Another example of whites paying for the sorry way blacks (and most half blacks) are growing up. I won&rsquo;t say &#8216;raised&rsquo;, because they AREN&rsquo;T being raised; they&rsquo;re just getting older.</p>
<p>Very few things surprise me, but I just cannot fathom the obscenely huge numbers of children in this country whose parents don&rsquo;t have a clue who they are, where they are, what they do, or what they think or feel - and simply don&rsquo;t care either way. Then all the wailing starts when &#8216;my baby done been kilt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So far in Atlanta there has been an average of young black males killing someone at least once a day since Christmas. And the parent, er, female mother-figure, can&rsquo;t understand what went wrong. One mother told that her 14 year old son &#8216;just left, going out the doe, (spelling intended) didn&rsquo;t say goodbye or nuthin&#8221; on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. Turns out he went to the new year&rsquo;s celebration in Atlanta. She didn&rsquo;t have a clue. He was stabbed to death by another black on his way home, 11 minutes after the New Year began. Well MAMA, where were you when he went out the &#8216;doe&rsquo;??? He was 14. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell him to stay home? Why didn&rsquo;t you demand it? Who didn&rsquo;t teach him to speak when you leave? Why don&rsquo;t you realize you&rsquo;re responsible for his death?</p>

		<p>I live in Nebraska. This guy&rsquo;s dad is a black Omaha cop. (It was HIS police gun that the kid used to kill the woman.) Affirmative action police hire. He should be prosecuted for keeping his gun where his son could get it. The murderer had just &#8220;left&#8221; (been kicked out of) another school in Lincoln.<br>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a car when I was 17.  High school was generally a happy time for me, however.  One of my best friends and I went shooting quite a bit, and I was dating the prettiest smart girl in the school.  Who needs a car?</p>
<p>Where the gun is concerned, it was either stolen, or kept unsecured and loaded in Butler&rsquo;s home by an irresponsible adult.  US law already requires one be at least 18 to purchase rifles and shotguns, and 21 to purchase a handgun, so obviously Butler didn&rsquo;t drive his car down to the nearest sporting goods store and buy the gun and a box of shells over the counter.</p>

		<p>Shawn, I live just a few miles outside Atlanta, and I wondered just as you do why the boy&rsquo;s mom had no idea where he was or with whom or what he was doing. He was 14! At a much older age, I could never have gone anywhere w/o my parents knowing all the details and would have been fussed at if I had come in &#8220;too late&#8221;. <br>
Remember the Atlanta child murders, &#8216;79-&#8216;81? It was the same thing.</p>

		<p>Actually, the election of Obama seems to have set off a string of black attacks on whites. It seems to me that this may be analogous to the &#8220;farm killings&#8221; of Boers in South Africa. Once the blacks get &#8220;their people&#8221; in power, there is a certain subset of that population that takes it as a cue for open season on whites. While the connection with this case is rather tenuous, it makes perfect sense in, for example, the Omar Thornton case.</p>

		<p>What an underprivileged black kid!  He has his own car and his dad had a good job (via affirmative action, mind you).  Sounds like he was really oppressed.  I&rsquo;m sure it was the evil racist white Nebraskans that are to blame.  We need more sensitivity training for whites, more anti-white discrimination, more outreach to the black community, more white giving up more money and rights, etc.  </p>
