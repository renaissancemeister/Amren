<h1><a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/new-european-union-school-calendar-omits-christian-holidays/">New European Union School Calendar Omits Christian Holidays</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Catholic News Agency, January 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 2011-2012 school calendar published by the European Union has omitted Christian holidays, while continuing to note important Jewish and Muslim celebrations.</p>
<p>The European Union has printed three million copies of the calendar which will be distributed free-of-charge to students who request them.</p>
<p>Former French politician and government minister, Christine Boutin, wrote in her blog Jan. 11 that the calendar leaves out Christianity, &#8220;the religion practiced or recognized as forming the cultural assembly of our &#8216;old&rsquo; continent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boutin is a consultant for the Pontifical Council for the Family, as well as president of the Christian Democratic Party in France. She went on to lament that Christianity has &#8220;fallen into the limbo of collective ignorance.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Christian holidays such as Christmas and Easter are missing from the calendar&rsquo;s pages, days commemorating &#8220;Sikh Baisakhi-Day, the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday, the Muslim holiday Aid-el-Kebir,&#8221; remain in place,&#8221; Boutin continued.</p>
<p>The Christian Democratic Party in France called the omissions &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; and has filed a petition asking that the calendars not be distributed as printed, but that students be given versions that include Christian holidays.</p>
<p>&#8220;The role of the Christian religion in the shaping of Europe is an undeniable historical fact&#8221; that the European Union cannot omit. To do so would be to &#8220;instruct students while denying that a particular religion has greatly contributed to the foundation and unity of Europe,&#8221; the organization said.</p>
<p>The petition states that the Christian religion is &#8220;the first of all religions in Europe. It is therefore unthinkable that it be denied, as it has great importance for the lives of all.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This is a snub as childish as it is calculated.  The so-called &#8220;European Union&#8221; is simply a globalist monstrosity dedicated (other than of course to sheer arbitrary and centralized power) to a single nihilistic principle of anti-Europeanism - that is, destruction not simply of Europe&rsquo;s borders, but also its cultures, its long-standing political and social institutions, its prevailing religions, and most sinister of all, its native European populations.  As such, it cannot last and cannot be permitted to last.</p>

		<p>Oh, yeah?  And exactly what is the Catholic Church <i>doing</i> about the ongoing de-Christianization of Europe?  It&rsquo;s far too busy &#8220;welcoming&#8221; nonWhites from every mudhole on Earth and having &#8220;interfaith dialogues&#8221; with Mohammedans to dirty its hands with such worldly matters as preserving its own existence.</p>
<p>Funny, and I always thought that Catholics considered suicide a sin.<br>

		<p>As a Christian, I applaud anything that gets Christianity out of the public sphere.   Where do you find the worst of race mixing and afro worship? White Christian denominations.  We deserve to be chased back into the catacombs.</p>
<p>Who are our worst enemies? White Christian missionaries who take our White Religion to the afrovoodoos and then hand our White daughters over to them as well.  White Christianity should be reserved for a select few hardy and brave families.  The sweetness of it all distorts the fibre and empowers the evil in our inferiors.  </p>

<p>Let me restate that: they despise -you-.  They love your goodies.</p>

		<p>Does everyone see how this works? First Christianity is omitted, knowing that there will be an uproar, then it is added back WITH the other religions, the other religions are now accepted.  This is part of the strategy, and it&rsquo;s quite disgusting and diabolical. </p>

		<p>I am Catholic but the Catholic church has always astounded me with the way they think (or not). They will send priests and nuns thousands of miles away to evangelize non-whites while the entire European cultural edifice crashes to the ground all around them. The center of European Christianity for 1500 years resided in Rome in the figure of the Pope. He has made himself almost totally irrelavent not having the courage to speak out about what is happening in the western world particularly in the realm of Christianity. I pray to God for a Pope or other truly strong religous leader who has the courage of his office. Surrounded by third world barbarians and leftist elitists who attempt at every turn to dismantle the cultural and institutional underpinnings of Western civilization the Catholic church sits complacently by while it is being wholly devoured, chewed up and spit out. It is like the shell of an old man whose spirit has left him but his body hasn&rsquo;t died yet. Where the outcry and outreach to the young people of Europe? Where the strong voices and even stronger men of courage that are desperately needed to turn the tide to oblivion? Where are the leaders who truly care about the souls and human needs of the European peoples? Where indeed? It seems that the care and nurturing of third world barbarians are of prime importance to them and the care and nurturing of European peoples are of no concern whatever. </p>

I&rsquo;m an unbeliever, an atheist, although of Christian upbringing. Despite my own lack of belief, this story really bothers me. Bothers me more than the average AmRen news item, and that&rsquo;s saying something. </p>
<p>As someone with a fair bit of proofreading, editing, writing, and publishing experience, I find it hard to believe that a calendar publishers&rsquo; omitting both Christmas AND Easter could be accidental. The odds against it would be extraordinary. </p>
<p>And the odds would be even more extraordinary against ONLY Christian events being overlooked, with no other non-Christian religions being subject to similar mistakes. It&rsquo;s not like the calendar was riddled with errors throughout. </p>
<p>So these exclusions could ONLY be deliberate. You don&rsquo;t send something off to the printers for THREE MILLION COPIES without many, many eyes passing over it, and many, many initials signing off on it. This was a decision taken at a higher level than those commissioned to produce the calendar. No doubt some lower level eyes DID notice the vanished Christian holidays, and pointed it out to their superiors. And apparently their superiors replied, &#8220;Yes, we know about that, but don&rsquo;t worry about it, it&rsquo;s not a mistake, it&rsquo;s SUPPOSED to be like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is European Christianity erasing itself. More specifically, it&rsquo;s the European Union erasing Christianity. A Continental org attempting to scribble out of existence the Continent&rsquo;s founding system of morality and behavior. A very successful system, too. They&rsquo;re shooting the horse they rode in on   &mdash;   despite the fact that it was a really good horse and in no need of death. </p>
<p>But then, that&rsquo;s what Marxism&rsquo;s all about, isn&rsquo;t it? Shooting the horse you rode in on&hellip; for no good reason. Strangling the Golden Goose&hellip; just to watch it die. </p>
<p>BTW, does this EU calendar atrocity count as an early contender for VDare.com&rsquo;s 2011 &#8220;War on Christmas&#8221; list, or as a late contender for their 2010 list?</p>

		<p>Kinda reminds me of Cheetch and Chong&rsquo;s Next Movie when Cheech says &#8220;Somebody ripped off the thing I ripped off!&#8221; The only thing Christmas has in common with a Christ is the name. The Christians and the Catholic church stole the winter solstice celebration and claimed it as their own; The Christmas tree and Santa Clause are also part of the Pagan celebration; They also stole the celebration of the goddess of fertility named Ester; The Vatican was built over a Pagan temple; There are many stories in the bible taken from earlier sources. I could go on and on. What comes around goes around. Maybe the Christians should have read the part of the bible that says &#8220;What ye sowith, so shall ye reapith.&#8221; It is about time that the Europeans dropped the Christianity nonsense and got back to drinking alcohol, hacking each other up with swords, and kidnapping beautiful blond woman. </p>

		<p>There is no mention of whether the indigenous European celebrations of Yule or Samhain are included. If there is nothing for whites, then this is clear discrimination. </p>

		<p>I said on a previous post that they were selling &#8220;Celebration&#8221; Cake this year, fortunately it looked and tasted like Christmas Cake!</p>
<p>Then we see so many references to the Holiday Season with the with the word Christmas ommitted. Christmas Cards now simply say &#8220;Seasons Greetings&#8221;</p>
<p>But slightly more seriously, many calendars now come out with the Muslim and Jewish year designation included. Here in Sydney the Chinese New year will be celebrated almost to the extent of the Official New year.</p>
<p>In the meantime we have Christian Churches in most towns and suburbs almost empty, they are being closed down and sold off in alarming numbers and become sites for either Mosques, temples or apartment blocks.(As a designated palce of worship a mosque can be build on a former Christian Church site without any zoning change)</p>
<p>While it is very easily to blame &#8220;them&#8221; for what is happening to our sociey, perhaps it is the &#8220;us&#8221; who as both nominal and/or practising Christians need to look at why we allowing all of this to occur.</p>
<p>Perhaps attending the local church this Sunday could be a good place to start.</p>

		<p>As a Norse pagan (following the steps of my ancestors), I do not believe in Christianity.<br>
However, Christianity has been one of the biggest indicators of Western civilization, you know, Christendom and all that.<br>
The fact that they present virtually every holiday in the world except European ones is nothing short of ridiculous. Islam is not European; it is a foreign religion, a religion that has been trying to destroy Europe ever since its creation. </p>
<p>Then again, the EU is neither European nor a Union. <br>

<p>Actually in the last few weeks the Pope has been denouncing what has been going on in Arab countries and Pakistan.  A christian Pakistani woman is under the death penalty for blasphemy against Islam.  He denounced that;result, an enraged mob burned down some churches.</p>
<p>In Egypt a police officer on his way to work shot killed 4 christians on the commuter train.  He knew the group was christian because the 3 women in the group were unveiled.</p>
<p>Interesting how those brave macho muslim men go after infidel women and old men isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>But every time the Pope says anything the muslims just abuse the local christians more than ever.</p>
<p>The ADL types who are continally carrying on about the so called abuses of the crusades don&rsquo;t help the Pope.  The ADL sides with the muslims in claiming the christian religion is the only one that ever harmed others.  The whitewashing of Islam&rsquo;s 1,500 attacks on Europe and its people&rsquo;s is one of the worst of the many anti White civilization things done by the ADL and its European equivalent. </p>

		<p>To the neo pagans who are offended the Christianity stole the winter and spring pagan festivals.</p>
<p>Well, yes Christianity did take over those festivals instead of massacring everyone and erasing those festivals from memory as the Romans did to the Druids.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>Remember that every Christian is aware that the Church took over the pagan festivals.  It is taught both in religion and history classes in every catholic school in the world.  Remember pagans, that in eradicating Christmas and EAster, the liberal anti White racists are also eradicating Europe&rsquo;s pagan roots which the christian church has never denied and even preserved by taking over Christmas and Easter.</p>

		<p>To anonymous #22 the Pope should be speaking out and reaching out to European WHITES with all the strength of his office. While I am sorry for Christians everywhere who suffer, the primary concern should be for the continuing existence of white people, white culture and white civilization. Will the Pope be allowed to relocate his headquarters to Pakistan or Egypt should Europe fall to third world barbarians? I think not. All around him Europe is besieged and burning and nary a word for the preservation of white peoples or civilization comes out of his mouth. This sort of so called &#8216;leadership&rsquo; is  less than useless. Whites are leaving the Christian churches because they know they have become anti-white and pro-third world. What true whites want are heroic leaders who will stand up for the race and not more mealy mouthed left leaning elitists. </p>

		<p>Comment from Australia #20: Excellent post. Yes, all White Christians ned to examine their priorities, and make time for GOD, and HIS Church. Otherwise, GOD will destroy HIS people that disobey HIM
<p>As far as the Church is concerned, the worst thing that happened to it was Vatican II, which brought almost 2,000 years of fortress Christian teachings to a grinding halt. </p>
<p>This is what brought about the Traditional Catholicism Movement, and a recognition by Pope John Paul II that Latin is still the language of the Church, and that langauage needs to be used in a Traditional Mass.</p>
<p>Most Catholics want a return to pre-Vatican II days. A European ethno-centered, cultured, and vibrant Church of Theological Scholarship, and tradition. We will have that again, with GOD&rsquo;s help, and the help of Our Lady. </p>
<p>As for the European Union, it has done all the damage to Europe, by edict, that it should be allowed to do, with the silence of its member States. It&rsquo;s time for these States to begin seceding, and restore their ethnic, and National pride, in themselves, and their Countries.</p></p>

		<p>&hellip;and of course, all those with either a low opinion of Christianity or a general doomer negativity are brought out by this story to give their individual stupid reasons as to why its being singled out for attack is just fine. As #16 HH wrote, this is not about the actual religion, but about the very much secular, social meaning it represents. White people cannot have their traditions; they cannot be valid; they cannot think well of themselves. It is a stark, horrific illustration of the ongoing demonization of White people and its genocidal intent.</p>
