          by Stephen Webster
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="dropcap">D</span>espite the best efforts of leftist thugs to shut it down, the eighth biennial <em>American Renaissance</em>
 conference was a great success, described by many veterans as the best 
they could remember. Held in Herndon, Virginia, over the weekend of 
February 22 through 24, the conference drew a near-record attendance of 
more than 260 activists from all across the United States, and from as 
far away as South Africa and Great Britain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sabotage efforts had begun as early as last October. An 
assortment of &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; groups tried to pressure the conference 
hotel, the Crowne Plaza Dulles Airport, to dishonor its contract with us
 and refuse to let us meet. They bombarded the hotel with telephone 
calls and e-mail messages, and even tried to browbeat the hotel owners 
and management company. The general manager stood his ground, issuing a 
statement saying the hotel did not discriminate against customers 
because of their political views.

          Organizations as varied as the Jewish Defense Organization, 
One People&rsquo;s Project, Grassroots America, Resistance and Solidarity, and
 Pueblos Unidos then vowed to protest the conference and, if possible, 
physically break it up. The Fairfax County police were more than ready 
for them, and kept several dozen demonstrators confined behind barriers 
and yellow police tape. After months of grandiose claims, the protest 
amounted to nothing more than a three-block march, some listless 
placard-waving, and the usual puerile chants of &#8220;We say no to racist 
fear! Fascists are not welcome here.&#8221; A group of five men with bandannas
 over their faces said they had driven five hours from Pittsburgh to get
 a chance to wave their solid-black flag. The protesters thus provided 
lunch-time diversion on the second day of the conference, but otherwise 
had no effect on the polished presentations and sustained camaraderie 
that characterized a memorable weekend.

          The conference itself began with registration on Friday 
afternoon, followed by a reception and remarks from the AR staff. Jared 
Taylor described the demonstrators&rsquo; threats to the audience, and warned 
that spies invariably sneak into the conference under false names and 
affiliations. &#8220;So let me present to you our opponents,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On the
 outside, thugs and barbarians. On the inside, sneaks and deceivers. 
Thank God we are not like them.&#8221; Conferees spent the rest of Friday 
evening in conviviality that lasted well into the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first speaker on Saturday morning was <strong>Philippe Rushton</strong>,
 the eminent psychometrician from the University of Western Ontario, who
 spoke about the heritability of racial differences in IQ. He first 
noted that the measured IQs of black Africans, which have consistently 
been found to be about 70, do not mean they are retarded. Instead, it is
 best to consider Africans as having the intelligence of normal 
11-year-olds. The smartest black Africans  &mdash;  engineering students  &mdash;  have IQs 
as high as 103, and it is reasonable to assume that they have IQs 30 
points above the average, as would be the case for top students in the 
United States. Calculating backwards, we again arrive at an average IQ 
of 70 for the black African population as a whole.
        </p>
        <table class="boxright">

        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          Prof. Rushton warned that despite optimistic predictions, 
India will not grow to become an economic superpower as he says China 
will. Although there are many smart Indians, their average IQ is 85, 
meaning that India will be outdistanced by China, where the average IQ 
is something over 100.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prof. Rushton noted that it is common to argue that the 
meager, unpleasant surroundings in which low-IQ people live drag down 
their intelligence, and that this, rather than genes, causes racial 
differences. On the other hand, one would expect low-IQ people to create
 meager environments for themselves, and there is a mass of evidence to 
suggest that the causation is far more IQ-to-environment than 
environment-to-IQ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transracial adoption studies, for example, show that children 
reared by people of different races end up with IQs closer to the 
average for their own race than to that of their adoptive parents. 
Likewise, non-whites have now lived for many generations in the United 
States and Europe, and their IQ scores are only slightly improved by 
better surroundings. Prof. Rushton cited the scores of second-generation
 North Africans living in Holland, whose average IQ of 89 is only a few 
points higher than the average in North Africa. &#8220;Genes,&#8221; explained Prof.
 Rushton, &#8220;keep culture on a leash.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          When the IQs of identical twins separated at birth are tested,
 their scores are very close on some tests and not so close on others, 
which suggests that certain abilities are more heritable than others. 
Similar testing of siblings has shown the same differences in 
heritability. Prof. Rushton pointed out that the racial performance gaps
 are greatest on those tests for which results are most heritable, which
 supports the view that racial differences in IQ are largely caused by 
genes.
        </p>
        <p>
          By now there are many mixed-race populations whose IQs have 
been carefully tested, and results are consistent with genetic 
explanations: Their average IQs tend to be mid-way between those of the 
parent populations. Finally, there is a clear correlation between brain 
size and IQ. Australian Aborigines, the population with the lowest 
recorded average IQ of 60, have the smallest brains, and North Asians 
have the largest brains. Findings such as this are very difficult to 
explain in terms of the impoverishing effect of environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prof. Rushton noted that although the mainstream media do not 
yet report studies of this kind, they are published in top-notch 
journals and are generally accepted by scholars in the field. It will be
 only a matter of time before they become widely known.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next speaker, <strong>Eugene Valberg</strong>, called upon
 many years of experience in South Africa to describe how Africans 
think. He said his interest in the subject was piqued by a conversation 
with Africans about gradation. How, he wanted to know, would a Zulu 
speaker describe a coconut as half-way up a tree? That can&rsquo;t be 
expressed, was the answer; the coconut is &#8220;up&#8221; the tree or not, and its 
relative location cannot be expressed. Dr. Valberg has since found that 
Africans often have a hard time understanding gradation, and tend to 
think in terms of one extreme or the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          He noted that African languages do not need dictionaries. 
Because they have no written literature, everyone who speaks them knows 
every word in the language. The resulting poverty of vocabulary reflects
 a poverty of expression and thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, non-native concepts have found their way into African 
languages, but it is important to distinguish between indigenous words 
and those that have been borrowed from Europeans. For example, there are
 now imported words in the Zulu language for &#8220;promise&#8221; or &#8220;obligation,&#8221; 
but Africans have a hard time understanding them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps most characteristic of African thinking is an absence 
of abstraction. Africans rarely get beyond the concrete, 
present-oriented, visible, and tangible. Because the future is not 
tangible, it is difficult for Africans to think about it realistically. A
 man who is healthy may not understand the purpose of medical insurance.
 His mind may run no further than &#8220;I&rsquo;m not sick now.&#8221; Likewise, the need
 to maintain machinery is often lost on Africans. If the motor is 
running fine now, why change the oil? Because Africans often cannot 
imagine things that do not exist, they cannot work seriously towards 
future goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Valberg argued that without abstract thinking it is hard 
to imagine the feelings of others. At the worst extreme, Africans can 
torture each other with astonishing callousness, and at the everyday 
level, they are often indifferent to or even unaware of their own 
rudeness or inconsiderateness. To be considerate requires an ability to 
imagine the feelings of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          South Africa is often called the rape capital of the world, 
but Dr. Valberg believes Africans do not fully grasp the concept of 
rape. They have been told that &#8220;rape&#8221; is a bad thing, yet most African 
men do not think it wrong to force a woman to have sex. This unthinking 
acceptance of the actions that constitute rape makes it difficult to 
prosecute rapists. Dr. Valberg also said that for most Africans, 
romantic love does not exist, and sex is the only thing that draws men 
and women together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lack of abstract thinking can be an advantage. Africans are 
almost never introspective or self-conscious. They are only rarely 
neurotic, and Dr. Valberg suspects that impotence is essentially unheard
 of among them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Valberg noted that although American blacks have higher 
IQs and operate at a higher level than African blacks, they exhibit many
 of the same tendencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fred Reed</strong>, the man behind the popular 
Internet site &#8220;Fred on Everything,&#8221; has lived in Mexico for many years 
and spoke on &#8220;Mexico From the Inside.&#8221; He said it is important to 
understand the country that is sending us so much of its population.
        </p>
        <p>
          He began by pointing out that many Americans have a cartoon 
image of Mexico. Burros and sombreros are still to be found, but are 
rare. The country is not crime- and disease-ridden, and many cities are 
safer than parts of the United States. He said the police are not 
omnipresent and that most people are not afraid of them. Unlike in the 
United States, people do not go through metal detectors to get into 
public buildings. Government services, when the authorities get around 
to providing them, are generally adequate, and Mexico benefits from not 
having a black underclass. Mr. Reed noted that if Mexico were a 
hell-hole, it would not be home to an expatriate population of 50,000 
Americans.
        </p>
        <table class="boxright">

        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          Why, then, do so many Mexicans want to leave? The population 
mix is part of it. Perhaps 10 percent of the population is white, and 
they are the government and professional elite. They live well and 
seldom come north. The mass of immigrants are Mestizos, who make up some
 60 percent of the population, although there are increasing numbers of 
non-Spanish-speaking Indians who are emigrating as well. There is little
 work for them in Mexico, and manual labor pays practically nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are distinctly Third-World qualities about Mexico, and 
immigrants are bringing them to America. There is widespread disregard 
for law and regulations. Anyone who can, cheats the authorities, and 
Mexicans ignore traffic regulations  &mdash;  you take your life in your hands on 
the roads. Mexicans also have contempt for schooling, which translates 
into high dropout rates among emigrants to the US.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of Mr. Reed&rsquo;s most interesting observations had to do with the <em>mañana</em>
 attitude, which is a reality and not a caricature. Many Mexicans really
 do live in the present, and have little sense of urgency about 
anything. Many lack ambition, and seem not to care about their 
communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mexicans go to the United States for one reason: money. They 
have been taught since infancy that the Southwest United States was 
stolen from them and believe, practically without exception, that any 
Mexican has the right to move to America. Although we think of the 
coyotes who charge money to take illegals north as ruthless exploiters, 
Mexicans see them as providing a necessary and legitimate service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Reed illustrated his talk with illuminating photographs from his own collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first speaker after lunch on Saturday was <strong>Martin O&rsquo;Toole</strong>,
 a lawyer and amateur historian who has done considerable research on 
the Civil War. He began by pointing out that the war has since led to a 
mass of disagreements: what were its causes, what were its goals, what 
should the war even be called? Ironically, he said, there was one area 
in which North and South were in agreement: They could not conceive of 
free blacks and whites living with each other in the same society.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the North, the percentage of blacks was invariably tiny, 
and blacks could rarely vote, serve on juries, or marry whites. They 
were nominally free, but were not full citizens. Some Northern states, 
when first establishing their constitutions, voted to exclude slavery 
but voted by even larger margins to exclude free blacks. The vast 
majority of Northerners wanted nothing to do with blacks. In the South, 
37 percent of the population were black, and even Southerners who 
opposed slavery thought it a necessary means of keeping blacks in order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Northern soldiers were willing to fight to preserve the 
Union, but not to free slaves. Abolition became a war aim for political 
reasons, and was not popular among soldiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. O&rsquo;Toole noted that the Northern attitude towards blacks 
accounts for the collapse of Reconstruction after the war. Once the 
slaves were freed, Northerners had little interest in forcing the South 
to accept blacks as social and political equals when they would not have
 accepted this themselves. Mr. O&rsquo;Toole pointed out that until 1952, 
federal law did not officially permit naturalization of non-whites as US
 citizens.
        </p>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole debunked the views of &#8220;Neo-Confederates&#8221; who are 
so imbued with anti-racism that they try to falsify the Confederate 
attitude towards blacks. They claim slavery had nothing to do with 
secession, that blacks massively supported the Confederacy, and that 50 
to 100 thousand black soldiers fought for the South. Mr. O&rsquo;Toole refuted
 all these claims, and noted that although the Confederacy did authorize
 enrollment of blacks, it was not until about three weeks before Lee&rsquo;s 
surrender at Appomattox.<br><br>
        <p>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole concluded by pointing out the chilling effect of 
multi-racialism on free speech. Before the war, the South was so fearful
 of abolition that it banned abolition meetings and propaganda. Today, 
the United States is so fearful of upsetting racial orthodoxy that race 
realism is, in effect, banned.
        </p>
        <p>
          AR editor <strong>Jared Taylor</strong> next spoke about why 
it is so difficult to persuade white people to give up their illusions 
about race. He said that a realistic understanding of race includes 
three basic concepts: That race is a real, biological category; that 
racial differences go beyond gross morphology; and that racial loyalty 
is natural and healthy. Current orthodoxy denies all three.
        </p>
        <table class="boxleft">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="/ar/2008/04/05b-Demonstrators.jpg" alt="." width="252" height="236" /> </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          Mr. Taylor argued that the view that race is some kind of 
sociological illusion will be the first building block of &#8220;race fantasy&#8221;
 to crumble. Everyone instinctively understands the reality of race, and
 no one who needs a kidney will ever say, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t bother with tissue 
matching; we are all brothers under the skin.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          He speculated that one reason many whites are reluctant to 
accept the reality of racial differences is that they feel sorry for 
blacks. It seems too cruel that on top of crime, poverty, illegitimacy, 
and disease, blacks are afflicted with low intelligence as well. He 
added that whites have repeatedly hesitated to speak in terms of race 
and IQ, even when their way of life depended on it: Southern 
segregationists spoke of States&rsquo; rights, and the Rhodesians opposed 
black rule in the name of fighting Communism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Taylor noted that the most plausible argument against 
white racial consciousness is the fact that all wars in history reflect 
group consciousness, and that in the past, whites have caused much 
bloodshed. He pointed out, however that all people in history have 
conquered their neighbors when they could, and that whites were 
particularly successful at this only because they were more 
technologically advanced. In fact, it was whites who first advanced the 
revolutionary idea that might does <em>not</em> make right, and that 
power should be used with forbearance. Whites have been racially passive
 for 50 years, yet they are invariably portrayed as the racial 
aggressors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Taylor concluded by pointing out that many whites cannot 
be reached with rational arguments and that we must make a moral as well
 as logical appeal. &#8220;We cannot simply be right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We must be 
better.&#8221; We must never give our opponents a chance to describe us as 
mean-spirited, spiteful, or dishonest, and by our superior moral example
 we will win the support of those whose minds may be closed to rational 
arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Paul Gottfried</strong>, who is a professor of humanities at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania, drew on his recent book, <em>Understanding Conservatism,</em>
 to discuss the failures of the American Right. He noted that there was a
 genuine Right in the United States before the Second World War  &mdash;  it was 
anti-interventionist, hated big government, and was loyal to the 
traditional culture of the United States. After the war and into the 
1950s, the United States had no authentic conservative movement, and 
what passed for such a movement was mainly Catholic traditionalism 
combined with fervent anti-Communism. It had no real social constituency
 and was preoccupied with &#8220;values&#8221; rather than with a traditional social
 order and national heritage. It did not seem to realize that &#8220;values&#8221; 
were a shaky foundation for a movement because they can always change, 
and because the Left frequently claims similar &#8220;values.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the Right&rsquo;s great mistakes  &mdash;  especially in the case of 
William Buckley&rsquo;s movement  &mdash;  was to so crave respectability that, as the 
country moved to the left, it excommunicated old comrades who stood 
their ground. Prof. Gottfried notes that as times changed, different 
excuses were given for &#8220;throwing people off the bus,&#8221; but accusations of
 racism and anti-Semitism were always favorites.
        </p>
        <p>
          The abandonment of what was thought to be one essential 
conservative position after another was inevitable after the 
infiltration and eventual takeover of the movement by neoconservatives, a
 largely Jewish group of former liberals and Communists who now dominate
 most right-of-center publications and institutions. It is now 
obligatory even for &#8220;conservatives&#8221; to sing the praises of Martin Luther
 King, Jr. and FDR, both of whom were scorned by pre-neocon 
conservatives.

        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          Prof. Gottfried is pessimistic about whether any meaningful 
conservative movement is possible in America. What passes for 
conservatism today is a lap-dog opposition that grants all the premises 
of the Left and then argues over a few details. Perhaps never in the 
history of politics has the Left had such an emasculated, accommodating 
opposition  &mdash;  because it is not really an opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of all the possible opponents to the dominant Left, Prof. 
Gottfried said he thought a libertarian opposition had the best chances.
 As for an opposition of the kind an AR audience would find 
satisfactory, he noted that the country has veered so sharply to the 
left in the last 40 years that it would take a radical reordering of the
 zeitgeist for such an opposition to emerge from marginalization.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a more optimistic note, Prof. Gottfried praised certain 
parties and intellectual movements in Europe, which are putting up a 
stiff fight for the traditions of the West. These, he noted, should be 
the models for an eventual resurgence of a promising American Right.

          After Prof. Gottfried&rsquo;s remarks, <strong>Gordon Baum</strong> 
of the Council of Conservative Citizens gave a brief summary of the 
activist work his organization has been doing in many parts of the 
country.

          The speaker after the Saturday banquet was <strong>Ashley Mote</strong>,
 an independent member of the European Union representing Great Britain.
 He began by pointing out that multi-culturalism is a contradiction, and
 that Britain is committing suicide through uncontrolled immigration. A 
nation, he pointed out, is defined by shared values and culture, and any
 dilution is dangerous.

        <p>
          Mr. Mote pointed out that although the British people are 
jealous of their sovereignty, their rulers have handed over much 
authority to the European Union. Mr. Mote finds the EU, in whose 
parliament he serves, so tyrannical and unrepresentative that he refers 
to it as the European Soviet Union. One of the EU&rsquo;s great tyrannies is 
to set a Europe-wide immigration policy and then let any immigrant 
admitted anywhere move to any member country. The result has been 
millions of aliens pushing into Britain to take advantage of high living
 standards. Mr. Mote estimates that his country can reasonably support 
30 million people but immigration has raised the population to double 
that figure. The newcomers are not British, and their presence is 
destroying a priceless, traditional way of life. For Mr. Mote, the only 
solution is for Britain to reassert its own national standards and to 
leave the European Union.
        </p>
        <p>
          How to bring this about? By setting an example. Mr. Mote said 
there is a small island now part of Britain that, according to ancient 
law, has the right to seek independence. Although he would not identify 
the island, he said its inhabitants are nearing the stage of seeking 
complete independence. The most likely name for the new country would be
 Britannia, and it would permit dual citizenship for Americans and 
others whose views are compatible with an explicitly British heritage. 
Like many other small nations, the island would raise money by issuing 
coins and postage stamps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Mote sees the value of Britannia not so much in what it 
would accomplish for its own citizens but as the precedent it would set 
as a breakaway territory from the European Union. He concluded by 
pointing out that when he has explained this plan to nationalist 
colleagues in the European Parliament, their enthusiastic reaction is, 
&#8220;Be sure to leave the door open when you leave.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          The program on Sunday morning began with the second-ranking official in the French National Front, <strong>Bruno Gollnisch</strong>.
 Mr. Gollnisch serves on the Central Committee of the National Front, 
has been shadow foreign minister, and now represents the party in the 
European Parliament.
        </p>
        <table class="boxcenter">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="/ar/2008/04/07a-ValbergCrowd.jpg" alt="Eugene Valberg" width="432" height="287" /> </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th class="photocaption"> A packed house listens to Eugene Valberg. </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          Mr. Gollnisch underlined the importance of the parliamentary 
grouping in the Euro-parliament he helped found: Identity, Tradition, 
Sovereignty. It is essentially an alliance formed by the National Front,
 the Freedom Party of Austria, the Vlaams Belang of Flanders, and 
Bulgarian nationalists (Mr. Mote is also a member). Parliamentary groups
 can hold hearings, initiate legislation, and influence policy in many 
ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Gollnisch spoke of how vital it is to defend Europe&rsquo;s 
heritage, including its ethnic heritage, from immigration. He also 
stressed the importance of maintaining European independence from 
Washington.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both these respects, each European nation must be able to 
determine its own policies, but the European Union is increasingly 
taking on the character of a superstate. Officials in Brussels, who are 
not answerable to European peoples, are able to subordinate the member 
nations to their wishes. Their ultimate goal is to reduce the powers of 
members to less than that of American states.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Gollnisch especially decried the Lisbon Treaty of December
 2007, which has ridden roughshod over traditional rights. He finds it 
particularly pernicious because it includes much of the language 
contained in a proposed new constitution for the European Union that was
 rejected by the French in a referendum. For example, it establishes a 
president of the EU, who is unelected, and therefore not subject to 
democratic control. Most crucially, immigration policy is now set by the
 EU rather than by individual nations. Mr. Gollnisch noted that even in 
historical terms, the emergence of a superstate violates the 
long-standing European tradition of an &#8220;equilibrium of powers.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Gollnisch explained that many Frenchmen agree with the 
National Front&rsquo;s views on sovereignty and French identity. The party did
 poorly in the last elections because Nicolas Sarkozy stole many Front 
ideas but without any real intension of applying them as policy. Mr. 
Gollnisch expressed confidence in the long-term future of the party 
because it reflects the sentiments of so many voters, and concluded with
 one of the Front&rsquo;s main slogans, &#8220;Patriots of all countries, unite!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Michael Walker</strong>, editor of <em>The Scorpion,</em>
 gave a rousing talk on what all of us can do for our cause as 
individuals. He noted that our race has been declining for the last 50 
years and that all of us are committed to reversing that decline. To 
this end, he made several concrete suggestions. First, we should always 
be entirely clear about what we think and believe. We should never have 
one story to tell inside the group and another to outsiders. We must 
think through our positions, and then be entirely candid about them. 
Second, we should never apologize. We should state our positions with 
complete confidence and never back down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, we should reject the false categories of optimism and 
pessimism. Pessimists can work themselves into a dismal state that makes
 them wonder why they should even bother. Optimists are usually 
political figures who promise instant and unrealistic success  &mdash;  leaving 
their followers downcast. &#8220;If it is your duty to work for our race,&#8221; he 
said, &#8220;optimism and pessimism have nothing to do with it.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, he urged us to avoid &#8220;cranks and historians.&#8221; Cranks, 
who seem irresistibly drawn to our movement, are the sort of people one 
would not comfortably introduce to one&rsquo;s mother or professional 
associates. It is best to stay away from them. &#8220;Historians&#8221; are people 
who want to characterize our struggle in terms of some aspect of the 
past, and this usually causes trouble. A fight over whether Lincoln or 
Churchill or even Hitler was good or bad is a distraction from our 
common struggle. Mr. Walker said he does not, himself, care for the 
French <em>tricolor,</em> as it is the flag of the Revolution, but this would never interfere with his support of French patriots who honor the flag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Walker also emphasized the contributions women can make to
 our movement. Unlike men, who have romantic ideas about what they can 
accomplish, women are practical and understand the importance of basic 
material objectives. He also pointed out that our age is one that has 
been increasingly feminized, so a movement dominated by male 
perspectives is likely to drift out of touch. Young people are also 
important to a movement, and they may be attracted by activities that 
are more fun than political.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Walker explained that alliances can be vital but they must
 always be approached practically. One need not like one&rsquo;s allies in 
order to work towards common goals, and alliances can be close, loose, 
or temporary, as appropriate. Some associations can bring our movement 
out of marginalization; others need not even be publicly acknowledged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Walker concluded that if we bear these principles in mind 
we will no longer be part of movements that do not move and false dawns 
that never come.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sam Dickson</strong> was true to his now-traditional 
AR role in closing the conference. He began by pointing out how many 
young people were in the audience, and marveled at the independence of 
mind now required for a young American to resist anti-white 
indoctrination. He noted that the governments of virtually every white 
nation are at war with their own people, and suggested that no monarch 
of past ages ever treated his own people with such savagery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Dickson wryly suggested that the old story of the 
emperor&rsquo;s new clothes should be retold to reflect our own times: Instead
 of being praised for his good sense, the child who points out the 
emperor&rsquo;s nakedness would be arrested and expelled from school, and his 
parents would be judged incompetent guardians and sent to a reeducation 
camp.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main theme of Mr. Dickson&rsquo;s remarks was the importance of a
 homeland for American whites. He noted that there are precedents for 
such homelands, most notably the creation of Israel as a homeland for 
Jews. He pointed out that unlike Israel, which required the replacement 
of one population with another, the United States has for centuries been
 the home of large numbers of whites, who could reach generous 
agreements on allocation of territory with populations of other races.
        </p>
        <p>
          He compared the longing of American whites for a homeland to 
the longing of the native Irish for homes of their own at a time when so
 many were tenants to absentee landlords. He read the poem <em>An Old Woman of the Roads</em> by Padraic Colum:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            O, to have a little house! <br>
            To own the hearth and stool and all! <br>
            The heap&rsquo;d up sods upon the fire, <br>
            The pile of turf against the wall!
          </p>
          <p>
            To have a clock with weights and chains <br>
            And pendulum swinging up and down! <br>
            A dresser filled with shining delph, <br>
            Speckled and white and blue and brown!
          </p>
          <p>
            I could be busy all the day <br>
            Clearing and sweeping hearth and floor, <br>
            And fixing on their shelf again <br>
            My white and blue and speckled store!
          </p>
          <p>
            I could be quiet there at night <br>
            Beside the fire and by myself, <br>
            Sure of a bed and loth to leave <br>
            The ticking clock and the shining delph!  &hellip;
          </p>
          <p>
            And I am praying to God on high, <br>
            And I am praying Him night and day, <br>
            For a little house  &mdash;  a house of my own  &mdash;   <br>
            Out of the wind&rsquo;s and the rain&rsquo;s way.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Mr. Dickson added that a desire for home or homeland is one of
 the most basic and legitimate, and that only when whites have a secure 
territory they can call their own will their future as a race and 
culture be assured.
        </p>
          With this benediction, and the hope of seeing everyone again 
at the next AR conference, a very successful weekend came to a close.  <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" width="11" height="11" />

Mr. Taylor concluded by pointing out that many whites cannot be reached with rational arguments and that we must make a moral as well as logical appeal. &ldquo;We cannot simply be right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We must be better.&rdquo; We must never give our opponents a chance to describe us as mean-spirited, spiteful, or dishonest, and by our superior moral example we will win the support of those whose minds may be closed to rational arguments.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I am not sure it is better to be better than to be (adamantly) right.  For this simply pushes you into a &#8216;double up&rsquo; two-minute hate zone of trying to be all that -and- a racist.  I remember an episode of &#8216;Law And Order&rsquo; where the canny prosecutor openly used this exact pretext to appeal to the Ordinary Joe jury in a case against a white nationalist couple (blonde couple, pretty white daughters, separatist household, questionable murder under review).</p>
<p>McCoy won the case by appealing to the lowest common denominator instinct of RAH.  Which he himself induced.</p>
<p>While we cannot pretend to have a National Socialist perfection of viewpoint as to -why- things must occur a given way.  What we absolutely must do instead is have a -how- things may move forward as a package deal that limits the transitional stress to a followon manner of living.  Suitable for those who want to listen to the offer and have the skills we need.  If it doesn&rsquo;t require such radical reconstruction of their lives as to ruin them anyway, we may gain more by quiet, private, discussion than ever we do by public debate.  For the country as it stans, makes our case for us.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>

<p>Sir, we are already there.  But it is not the child who is blamed.  It is the crowd.  &#8216;To be associated&rsquo; with the wrong people is to legitimize interference to disband and disperse them in a way never previously (yell &#8216;Fire!&rsquo; in a crowded theater) intended.</p>
<p>In this, we must see, via the direct acts against AmRen Conferences that we are being driven underground deliberately.  For that is the only way to effectively undercut the unified, learned, rational, discourse by which we are most persuasive.</p>
<p>And that is why I believe that &#8216;Historians and Cranks&rsquo; may yet have some use.  For a Historian can point out when this has happened before.  And a crank can say: &#8220;And what happened to those sorry fellows?&#8221; in a way that suggests alternatives by stronger or preemptive means.  Cranks are good at conspiracy.  Cranks can rally a crowd in isolation and by covertness through the drive of their persistent zeal of belief.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
And I am praying to God on high, <br>
And I am praying Him night and day, <br>
For a little house &mdash; a house of my own &mdash;  <br>
Out of the wind&rsquo;s and the rain&rsquo;s way. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The wind and the rain come as ghosts, pulling with wry whispers at the dead dry bones of a society as nation who are no more.  The elements cannot beat down doors as man can.  And multiculturalism will know no limits until it is sure of it&rsquo;s &#8216;diversity as king!&rsquo; _sole_ supremacy.  The ultimate bigot issuing it&rsquo;s thought control manipulations in all our ears.</p>
<p>It is not a house that we need.  Most whites would not know what to do with one to survive if given it.  Instead, we must take and remake as exclusively our own, chock a block, an entire society around which the American Dream can be remade, in microcosm.</p>
<p>Defense, Agriculture, Industry, Trade Access, Education, Genes.  We need them all.  Or we will falter and fall back into dissolution.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin was right:  Until we see in ourselves the potential, as WSM states, to bond as one body encompassing -all- these necessary national characteristics.  Crafting a plan accordingly to &#8216;hang together&rsquo; in protecting them, we will surely fall, one by one, separately.  Alone.</p>
<p>It is time people, to think what the term &#8216;majority minority&rsquo; really means.  And specifically whether owing a loyalty to a country we no longer own is worth the continued degradation of law as Constitutional rights necessary to live here.</p>
<p>It was a Repblican President who said:  &#8220;The Constitution is just a G-D piece of paper&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>The first speaker on Saturday morning was Philippe Rushton, the eminent psychometrician from the University of Western Ontario, who spoke about the heritability of racial differences in IQ. He first noted that the measured IQs of black Africans, which have consistently been found to be about 70, do not mean they are retarded. Instead, it is best to consider Africans as having the intelligence of normal 11-year-olds. The smartest black Africans &mdash; engineering students &mdash; have IQs as high as 103, and it is reasonable to assume that they have IQs 30 points above the average, as would be the case for top students in the United States. Calculating backwards, we again arrive at an average IQ of 70 for the black African population as a whole. <br>
