<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Deportations of illegal immigrants have reached new heights for two years running under President Obama, statistics show, but Republicans say they&rsquo;ll use their new majority in the House to press for more aggressive enforcement without any path to legal status.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers called on the Obama administration to return to the era of workplace raids to arrest illegal employees, an approach that contrasts sharply with the president&rsquo;s continued push to create a path to citizenship for &#8220;responsible young people&#8221; and deport only those illegal immigrants charged with serious crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Large-scale workplace arrests of illegal workers were hallmarks of the George W. Bush administration&rsquo;s approach in its final years. But two years ago Obama decided to shift enforcement efforts to focus on employers who knowingly hire illegal workers.</p>
<p>Arrests from worksite raids for immigration-related offenses, such as using a forged driver&rsquo;s license or a fake Social Security number, have dropped by 70% since the end of the Bush administration, when a series of large raids of factories and meatpacking plants received national media attention.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But with illegal immigration likely to be a hot-button issue in the 2012 campaign season, House Republicans on the House Judiciary subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement plan to hold hearings to criticize an administration they claim allows illegal immigrants to take American jobs.</p>
<p>With unemployment over 9%, &#8220;it is hard to imagine a worse time to cut worksite enforcement efforts by more than half,&#8221; Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday. &#8220;Citizens and legal immigrants should not be forced to compete with illegal workers for jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though workplace raids are high-profile and often receive media attention, they also are criticized as an expensive and unnecessarily traumatic approach to attacking the problem.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Broad sweeps fill limited jail and court docket space the Obama administration wants to reserve for more hardened criminals, officials said. Each deportation costs the federal government about $12,500, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deputy Director Kumar Kibble told lawmakers Wednesday.</p>
<p>Instead, targeting employers is part of an effort by the administration to thwart illegal immigration by reducing the demand for illegal jobs, which draws hundreds of thousands across the border each year to look for work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under Obama, cases against employers are up sharply: Immigration and Customs Enforcement quadrupled the number of employer audits after Obama took office, increasing the number of inspections and arrests against those who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. Businesses were fined $6.9 million in fiscal 2010, up from $675,000 in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Obama administration deported 392,862 illegal immigrants in fiscal 2010, according to ICE figures, a 6% increase over the 369,221 removed from the country in 2008.</p>
<p>More than 195,000 criminals were deported in 2010, a 70% increase over 2008 in the forced removal of immigrant criminals.</p>
<p>The number of illegal immigrants coming into the U.S. is declining, according to a report released in September by the Pew Hispanic Center.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how fining these companies helps anyone. Just put these companies&rsquo; executives and board of directors in prison- perhaps 6 months for each illegal employee will discourage other companies from hiring illegal workers. And then these companies could use the money that they would have paid in fines to hire legitimate employees. </p>

<p>Nader once called for a corporate death penalty for certain grave offenses on the part of a corporation by its high level agents, i.e. dis-incorporation and liquidation of the assets, not the electric chair.  Perhaps that&rsquo;s an option for what you&rsquo;re speaking of.</p>

		<p>The police arrest prostitutes all the time. As soon as they make bail they&rsquo;re back on the streets working the same corner. But when the police arrest the solicitors and publish their pictures in the paper then business dries up and the prostitutes all leave town.</p>
<p>Gangs and cartels frequent kill one another for drug turf. That doesn&rsquo;t stop the drug trade. But countries who are serious about stopping drugs don&rsquo;t even bother with smugglers. They focus all their efforts on drug users. Including the death penalty. Without customers the gangs and cartels go away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple matter of economics. It&rsquo;s supply and demand. If the profits are high then you have to forget about the suppliers and go after the demand. </p>
<p>In the case of illegal immigration the illegals are the suppliers. They supply an employers demand for cheap, illegal labor. If you want to stop illegal immigration then you have to go after the employers. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. </p>
<p>The GOP strategy of going after illegals and letting employers off the hook doesn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s a trick. They&rsquo;re in the pocket of big business and industry lobbyists.</p>

		<p>I wonder if they are suggesting this to take the heat off of employers for hiring them?  Once the workplaces have been raided and the illegals shipped out the companies will simply hire another batch of illegal workers.  I&rsquo;d say a combination of workplace raids and employer fines would do the trick.  Actually they probably should do something a little more punitive like automatic prison time for the President, CEO and Human Resource Managers that are doing the hiring. The prospects of sharing a cell with some gangbanger will cure the company&rsquo;s lust for cheap slave labor. </p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s Presidency may have seen a rise in deportations, but on the other hand he wants to pass the Dream Act which will give these students the chance to bring their lawbreaking parents and extended family members into the &#8220;fold.&#8221; This is chain migration and needs to stop. We are NOT a country of laws. We are a country of UNenforced laws. And I don&rsquo;t consider us a country of immigrants. We are a nation of American citizens being held hostage by 30 million illegal aliens. Why not save the billions we are forced to pay for their upkeep and pay down the debt? We also need to stop trying to play Santa Claus to the world. Every year we send Egypt 1.3 billion. Why? When are we going to learn that we can&rsquo;t buy friends? And these &#8220;friends&#8221; are only friendly as long as Uncle Sam is handing out the loot. Let&rsquo;s pray our government stops being the world&rsquo;s fool.</p>

Immigration raids never amount to much.                       The big corporations and the politicians they finance maintain quotas on immigration.</p>
<p>Even if it means that millions of Americans lose their jobs and thouands die.</p>

		<p>NAVY is right.  With an added proviso: the raid lists are the medium-small businesses, the mom and pop factories, coops and the like which need cheap labor to stay afloat in a world increasingly dictated to by transnationalist profiteers.</p>
<p>Fewer small businesses means more room for uncontrolled growth of megacorps as the U.S. (and indeed, world) are reduced to dependent welfare states, licking the boots of runaway capitalism.</p>
<p>If you want to stop this, you have to look at simple numbers:</p>
<p>1.  195,000 X 12,500 = 2.43 billion.  All of which you and I pay.</p>
<p>2.  500,000 are caught at the border each year.  BP says that they get 1 in 3.  That&rsquo;s a million more who make it.  Countries have been invaded with fewer troops.</p>
<p>3.  There are already 20 million (at least) illegals here.<br>
20 million + 1 per year X 1,500 dollars a month in various transfer payments (which you and I pay) for bilingual education, rent assistance, food stamps and the like.  Comes up to about 360 billion a year.</p>
<p>Answers:</p>
<p>Build a fence that works.  A single bulldozer can dig a 10X20ft trench, a mile long, in a month.  Fill it with mines.  Charge Mexico a million dollars per illegal we catch laying planks.  Since they supposedly only receive 30 million in USAID funds a year-</p>
<p>http://www.usembassy-mexico.gov/eng/aid.html</p>
<p>You might also consider a 500 dollar tariff on imported goods, per illegal.</p>
<p>So that their &#8216;cheap commerce&rsquo; no longer has a market.</p>
<p>Chasing illegals through the deportation process without a secure border and protected trade (including decent wages to bring Americans back into the jobs that are vacated) is bailing the ocean with a teaspoon.</p>

Republicans are grandstanding on this issue, without doing much of anything to punish employers of illegal immigrants.  <br>

		<p>The fines are just a drop in the bucket, compared to the money they save by hiring illegal workers. I think they should fire those in charge of hiring illegals, and put them in jail. The above suggestion of 6 months per illegal is about right, but they need to go further. The company&rsquo;s owners should LOSE that business, and it should be sold at cost to someone who will not hire illegals, and the new owners monitored to make sure they follow through by hiring only Americans.<br>
For every business that is lost through consistant enforcement, there will be a hundred more that will start hiring only American workers, thus providing far more jobs than were lost. The tired old canard that illegals &#8220;only do the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221; has been proven  false so many times it dosen&rsquo;t even soulnd true to those who say it. Americans WILL pick fruit, build houses, or wash toilets if necessary to feed their families. The constant flood of immigrants coming here illegally will dry up quickly when there are no jobs for them, no welfare and other goodies provided by the taxpayers via our treasonous government.</p>

So deporting almost 800,000 over a two year period when we have probably 20+ million in this country is supposed to be some sort of &#8220;record?&#8221; That just shows how out of control illegal immigration is in this country. </p>
<p>My question is how many illegal invaders entered this country during the same time frame?  Shouldn&rsquo;t that number be factored in or deducted? What good is it to deport someone if they come back next week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly glad some of the &#8220;worst of the worst&#8221; are being deported, but these numbers hardly satisfy the definition of being &#8220;tough&#8221; on illegals. In fact, many of the illegals apprehended have been deported two or three times already. What gives? What&rsquo;s so tough about being deported and then coming back again, only to be deported again. Apparently, not much.</p>
<p>No matter, this isn&rsquo;t really about enforcing our immigration laws or deporting illegals. What it&rsquo;s about is touting numbers to make it appear as if this administration has been tough on illegals in order to make demands for amnesty more palatable for the American public. </p>
<p>If this administration were serious about immigration enforcement, then obama wouldn&rsquo;t have filed suit against Arizona and E-Verify would be the law of the land&hellip;for starters.</p>
