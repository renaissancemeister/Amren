			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean O&rsquo;Hagan, Guardian (London), January 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In downtown Detroit, the streets are lined with abandoned hotels and swimming pools, ruined movie houses and schools, all evidence of the motor city&rsquo;s painful decline. The photographs of Yves Marchand and Romain Meffre capture what remains of a once-great city  &mdash;  and hint at the wider story of post-industrial America temporarily disbanded. The building it vacated was abandoned with everything in it: furniture, uniforms, typewriters, crime files and even the countless mug-shots of criminals who had passed through there. Among the debris that photographers Yves Marchand and Romain Meffre found there in 2005 was a scattering of stiff, rotting cardboard files each bearing a woman&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>In total 11 women had been catalogued by the police, including Debbie Ann Friday, Vicki Truelove, Juanita Hardy, Bertha Jean Mason and Valerie Chalk. Down in the dank basement of the police station, where &#8220;human samples&#8221; were stored  &mdash;  and had been abandoned along with everything else  &mdash;  the two French photographers also uncovered the name of the man who was linked to all of the women&rsquo;s deaths. Benjamin Atkins was a notorious serial killer. Between 1991 and 1992 he left the bodies of his victims in various empty buildings across the city.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>A photograph simply entitled <cite>Criminal Investigation Report, Highland Park Police Station</cite> is one of the many startling images in an extraordinary book, <cite>The Ruins of Detroit,</cite> that Marchand and Meffre have made from their seven week-long visits to Detroit between 2005 and 2009. The book&rsquo;s photographs suggest the countless strange and sad narratives from urban life in America in the mid-to-late 20th century. It is also a book of testimony, which not only illustrates the dramatic decline of a major American city, but of the American Dream itself. Many of the images seem post-apocalyptic, as if some sudden catastrophe has struck downtown Detroit, forcing everyone to abandon homes and workplaces and flee the city.</p>
<p>Cumulatively, the photographs are a powerful and disturbing testament to the glory and the destructive cost of American capitalism: the centre of a once-thriving metropolis in the most powerful nation on earth has become a ghost town of decaying buildings and streets. There is a formal beauty here too, though, reminiscent of Robert Polidori&rsquo;s images of post-hurricane Katrina New Orleans. &#8220;It seems like Detroit has just been left to die,&#8221; says Marchand, &#8220;Many times we would enter huge art deco buildings with once-beautiful chandeliers, ornate columns and extraordinary frescoes, and everything was crumbling and covered in dust, and the sense that you had entered a lost world was almost overwhelming. In a very real way, Detroit is a lost world  &mdash;  or at least a lost city where the magnificence of its past is everywhere evident.&#8221;</p>
<div class="text-center"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">  <tr>    <td align="center" width="500">&nbsp;<br><img src="/news/2011/01/06/ruined-detroit2.jpg" alt="500"><br><img src="/graphics/spacer.gif" width="500" height="4"><small><b>The ballroom of the Lee Plaza Hotel.</b></small></td>  </tr></table></div>
&nbsp;
<p>This sense of loss is what Marchand and Meffre have captured in image after image, whether of vast downtown vistas where every tower block is boarded-up or ravaged interior landscapes where the baroque stonework, often made from marble imported from Europe, is slowly crumbling and collapsing. The pair have photographed once-grand hotels that were built in a carefree mix of gothic, art deco, Moorish and medieval styles, as well as countless baroque theatres, movie houses and ballrooms  &mdash;  the Vanity, where big band giants such as Duke Ellington and Tommy Dorsey played in the 1930s; the Eastown theatre, where pioneering hard rock groups like Iggy and the Stooges and the MC5 held court in the 1960s.</p>
<p>They have also captured for posterity the desolate interiors that once made up the city&rsquo;s civic infrastructure: courthouses, churches, schools, dentists, police stations, jails, public libraries and swimming pools, all of which have most of their original fixtures and fittings intact. &#8220;As Europeans, we were looking with an outsider&rsquo;s eye, which made downtown Detroit seem even more strange and dramatic,&#8221; says Meffre. &#8220;We are not used to seeing empty buildings left intact. In Europe, salvage companies move in immediately and take what they can sell as antiques. Here, they only take the metal piping to sell for scrap. In the Vanity ballroom alone, we saw four giant art deco chandeliers, beautiful objects, each one unique. It was almost unbelievable that they could still be there. It is as if America has no sense of its own architectural history and culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marchand (29) and Meffre (23) have been taking photographs together since they first met in 2002. They are both children of Paris&rsquo;s banlieue, hailing from the southern suburbs of the city. Without formal training, they describe themselves as &#8220;autodidacts who share an obsession with ruins&#8221;, which, says Meffre, &#8220;allow you to appear to enter a different world, a lost world, and to report back from there&#8221;.</p>
<p>Having photographed old buildings  &mdash;  &#8220;mainly disused theatres&#8221;  &mdash;  in Paris, they happened upon an image of Michigan Central train station in Detroit while surfing the internet for pictures of abandoned buildings. &#8220;It was so stately and so dramatic that we decided right then we had to go,&#8221; says Meffre, &#8220;but we were naive; we had no idea of the scale of the project, of the vastness of downtown Detroit and its ruins. There is nothing comparable in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The essayist Edmund Wilson wrote of Detroit in the 1930s: &#8220;You can see here, as it is impossible to do in a more varied and complex city, the whole structure of industrial society.&#8221; Back then, Detroit was the world capital of car production, the place where, in 1913, Henry Ford had built the first plant devoted to mass production, employing 90,000 workers in order to make enough Model T Fords to meet the demands of a burgeoning domestic market. The city&rsquo;s architecture reflected its wealth and ambition: the waiting room of Michigan Central station was designed to look like a giant Roman bathhouse, ballrooms were built in extravagantly baroque styles that equalled anything in New York.</p>
<p>By the 1950s, the city was home to almost 2 million people, and its mainly single-storey suburbs had spread over 120 square miles. Detroit&rsquo;s dramatic decline began soon afterwards, though, and those same suburbs would play their part in the long saga of abandonment and decay. The collapse of the automobile industry started in the 1950s and reached crisis point in the 1960s and 1970s, due mainly to the demand for cheaper imported cars, made mainly in Japan, and the attendant rise in global oil prices. By then, Detroit was, in the words of Thomas J Sugrue, author of <cite>The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit,</cite> who provides the book&rsquo;s illuminating introductory essay, &#8220;one of America&rsquo;s most racially polarised cities, the result of deep-rooted hostilities between the city&rsquo;s white and African-American populations&#8221;.</p>
<p>The so called &#8220;white flight&#8221; from the city centre began in the 1950s and, soon, as Sugrue puts it, &#8220;an increasingly black city was surrounded by a ring of communities that were all white&#8221;. This &#8220;white noose&#8221;, as one contemporary observer referred to it, helped strangle the inner city, both economically and socially, turning it into a series of large ghettos intercut by freeway. Unrest reached a head in 1967, when 43 people were killed in a week of rioting that started after police officers raided an after-hours drinking club and which left the downtown streets looking like a war zone. Since then, the city has been left increasingly to its own devices  &mdash;  abandoned by politicians, planners, developers and businesses, by all, in fact, but the black urban poor. &#8220;Even grocery stores and supermarkets disappeared from the city,&#8221; writes Sugrue. &#8220;By the first decade of the 21st century, observers described Detroit as &#8216;a food desert&rsquo;  &mdash;  a place without even a single, well-stocked supermarket within its boundaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tension of the 60s coincided with the moment when Detroit was the capital of American popular music, with the Stooges and the MC5 creating a proto-punk music that remains influential to this day and the Tamla Motown hit factory, founded by producer-cum-entrepreneur Berry Gordy, creating hit after hit for the likes of Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, the Supremes and the Temptations. Gordy, too, though, deserted the city in 1972, moving the Motown operation to Los Angeles. Still, throughout the hard times, Detroit has remained a place of pioneering pop music and is regarded as the city where techno was created in the 1980s. Today&rsquo;s Detroit, particularly the blighted 8 Mile Road stretch that separates the city from its northern suburbs, is synonymous with the hard-edged rap music of Eminem, the city&rsquo;s most notorious son, whose songs reflect the edginess and gang culture of the place.</p>
<p>Of late, there are plans afoot to restore some of Detroit&rsquo;s historic buildings and an even more ambitious plan to &#8220;green&#8221; many of the open spaces where weeds, trees and prairie grasses have grown among tower blocks and disused car plants. Detroit may thrive again but it will take considerable political will and enormous reinvestment.</p>
<p><cite>The Ruins of Detroit</cite> tells the city&rsquo;s story so far in one starkly beautiful photograph after another, all of which add up to nothing less than an end-of-empire narrative. Or as Sugrue puts it: &#8220;The abandoned factories, the eerily vacant schools, the rotting houses, and gutted skyscrapers that Yves Marchand and Romain Meffre chronicle are the artefacts of Detroit&rsquo;s astonishing rise as a global capital of capitalism and its even more extraordinary descent into ruin, a place where the boundaries between the American dream and the American nightmare, between prosperity and poverty, between the permanent and the ephemeral are powerfully and painfully visible. No place epitomises the creative and destructive forces of modernity more than Detroit, past and present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;White noose,&#8221; as if whites were out to lynch people of the inner city.  Scant attention is paid to why whites were impelled to leave a city in which their families had often resided for generations, i.e., violent crime perpetrated by blacks on the streets and in the schools. </p>

		<p>When left to their own devices, blacks destroy culture and civilization.  This can be tested in Detroit or any form European colony in Africa where there was modern agriculture until the whites left.  Now there is famine.  Famine even follows the African to Detroit where they have shoplifted all of their supermarkets into oblivion.  But Whites are blamed by the author of this article for leaving blacks to their own devices which is anarchy.  </p>

		<p>How true! &#8220;What happens when whites leave.&#8221; Meanwhile, the mainstream media continuosly tries to brainwash the public that blacks are &#8220;just like us&#8221; Anyone who has lived or frequently drives through black neighborhoods should know better. I never thought I would live to see the day to start believing this: but we should return to segregation.  Over and over again, no matter what we try, blacks constantly show that they are just not mentally equipped to sustain a high level of civilisation.</p>

		<p>Couple things pop out-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The so called &ldquo;white flight&rdquo; from the city centre began in the 1950s and, soon, as Sugrue puts it, &ldquo;an increasingly black city was surrounded by a ring of communities that were all white&rdquo;. This &ldquo;white noose&rdquo;, as one contemporary observer referred to it, helped strangle the inner city, both economically and socially, turning it into a series of large ghettos intercut by freeway.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Generally, in times of economic plenty, it is the urban centers which are the points of growth and the suburban and rural settings which become &#8216;deserts&rsquo; of economic potential.</p>
<p>If the 1967 riots essentially left blacks on their own -with- a city environment in which to prosper, why didn&rsquo;t they?  It&rsquo;s not the white&rsquo;s fault.  Rather it is the fact that blacks, with a mean IQ of 87 cannot produce a substantial enough mid/upper class (IQ 115 and above), socially conformist, highly dedicated, professional body to sustain -any- kind of independently civilized population mass.</p>
<p>That is what the rest of the article attempts to hold up as &#8216;proof of cultural sincerity&rsquo; with the constant mentions of pop-music culture.  When in fact being &#8216;hip&rsquo; just isn&rsquo;t enough to &#8216;keep it real&rsquo; in a world of working economics.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Or as Sugrue puts it: &ldquo;The abandoned factories, the eerily vacant schools, the rotting houses, and gutted skyscrapers that Yves Marchand and Romain Meffre chronicle are the artefacts of Detroit&rsquo;s astonishing rise as a global capital of capitalism and its even more extraordinary descent into ruin, a place where the boundaries between the American dream and the American nightmare, between prosperity and poverty, between the permanent and the ephemeral are powerfully and painfully visible. No place epitomises the creative and destructive forces of modernity more than Detroit, past and present.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Capitalism, as it once was, was astonishingly protective.  What destroyed Detroit and is indeed in the process of destroying America is universalist socialism as a means to use &#8216;free market&rsquo; ideals to send our industry overseas to newer factories with later technologies and a slave-labor culture.  While somehow thinking that this won&rsquo;t eventually be turned around to come back at us.</p>
<p>Had we reinvested in our own technology base instead of standing up everyone else&rsquo;, this would not be happening.  And ALL those bad habits came in the wake of WWII and the assumed white guilt for black disenfranchisement and Jewish holocaust.</p>
<p>It may well be too late to fix that.  But accepting yet more blame for what was NEVER &#8216;our fault&rsquo; is just so much guff we need to stop pretending we owe to anyone else&rsquo; easing of conscience over the failure of their own leftist pipe dreams.</p>

		<p>&#8220;White Flight&#8221; is the left&rsquo;s euphemism for whites&rsquo; escaping with their lives after Detroit was set on fire during the riots of the 60&rsquo;s. For those whites who tried to stay there was continued<br>
violence, harrassment, rape and theft. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to put a link here but if you go to Youtube and search for &#8220;Detroit city on the move&#8221; you&rsquo;ll find a documentary from 1965 narrated by the then (and last white) mayor Cavanaugh.  I wasn&rsquo;t around in 65 but it&rsquo;s amazing to see what once was compared to now.</p>

<p>I went to &#8216;Greektown&rsquo; a few times.  (Really just a restaurant/bar mini-mall with no Greeks living there.)  The vagrants and thugs were barely kept at bay by the hulking cops who seemed omnipresent.</p>

		<p>Too many whites rationalize the wreckage of our cities by saying &#8220;Oh, well, they weren&rsquo;t worth saving anyway,&#8221; or, &#8220;The cities were abandoned because they were too crowded,&#8221; or some other such nonsense. In reality, some of our country&rsquo;s greatest history, architecture, and culture could be found in the cities. </p>
<p>Far from escaping the rat race, people are finding themselves having to drive farther and farther to get a decent job. Urban sprawl runs counter to the liberals&rsquo; great cause of environmentalism. Now that many of the suburbs are &#8220;changing&#8221; and whites are fleeing to exurbia, what will be the new excuse for white flight?</p>

		<p>Using phrases like &#8220;starkly beautiful,&#8221; &#8220;the demise of the American dream,&#8221; and &#8220;end-of-an-empire,&#8221; Sean O&rsquo;Hagan and the photographers seem to take great delight in the wreckage of Detroit. Perhaps they are those America haters who believe that we have gotten our come-uppance. </p>
<p>In this article,the ruins of Detroit sound like the ruins of ancient Greece or Rome.  As a former resident of the Motor City, I hardly find its present condition so romantic.</p>
<p>He also makes &#8220;the white noose&#8221; sound like the Nazi devised  Warsaw Ghetto, so that Whites get the blame for masterminding the city&rsquo;s physical and social destruction wrought by blacks.</p>
<p>Blacks virtually have the entire city for themselves. What is stopping the NAACP and their liberal supporters from creating a great, shining, black City on a Hill?  </p>

		<p>I spent the first 22 years 0f my life in Detroit. I left in 1975 right after I graduated from college. By that time the city&rsquo;s dismal future was apparent to every White resident with an IQ higher than that of a dog. White flight was on its 3rd great wave when I left.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of &#8220;reasons&#8221; for the decline of the Motor City, but they are never actual reasons, just excuses to avoid confronting the racial aspect of everything that has gone wrong in the place I once proudly called home.</p>
<p>Sometimes they blame it on poverty, but the White folks who lived in Detroit during the First Great Depression seldom had two pennies to rub together and they somehow resisted the urge to destroy the buildings and murder each other on a large scale. As a matter of fact, many Whites moved back to family farms to ride out the hard times and their city homes were untouched when they were finally able to return.</p>
<p>Other times they blame it on racism. I suppose that is somewhat true because the racist Black criminals who drove out the Whites  definitely played a pivotal role in transforming Detroit from a diamond to a lump of coal.</p>
<p>Corrupt Detroit politicians are also commonly blamed for Detroit&rsquo;s present condition. What color were they and who elected them?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also heard that the urban blight was caused by welfare. Do you have to ask for welfare, or do they work it like a reverse mugging? Do they catch you in a dark spot, pull a gun on you and shove a check in your pocket? Did all of those never-had-a-job people flock to Detroit from all over the country to turn over a new leaf only to be mugged and have a check forced upon them every month?</p>
<p>Maybe we can more fully understand what happened to Detroit by studying places that look just like Detroit. We may be able to unravel the mystery by examining what Detroit has in common with Monrovia and Port-au-Prince.  </p>

		<p>No where on this planet that has been taken over or is run by blacks show any development. So these pictures of a once proud, great white city came as no surprise. It&rsquo;s just very sad what our once great cities are becoming. </p>
<p>And STILL these ignorant blacks try and blame whitey. And the white liberal defenders of these fools still try and propagate these myths and lies. Just ask Obama, Oprah, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, any of them, if they would want to live around these type of blacks. Of course not! But we&rsquo;re expected to?</p>
<p>Slowly, people are startng to wake up. For one simple reason. It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to hide the truth. There is so much evidence of the collaspe of our country going on everywhere. And I feel things are coming to a head. And it won&rsquo;t be pretty but I, for one, am prepared to fight for a country and way of life that I love. And I cannot and will not be intimidated.</p>

		<p>These two men have plagiarized another web site with another set of photos also called the ruins of Detroit?</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it is absolutely true that at one time Dee was one of the dozen or so major cities of the world. The auto industry world-wide took a cue from whatever was going on in Dee. </p>
<p>There is a famous photo from the 1930&rsquo;s of the street in front of Hudson&rsquo;s, the most exclusive department store at one time ijn Dee. During the Depression era, at Christmas time. The street and sidewalks you cannot see, the crowds are so great. A photo was taken about fifty or so years later at the same exact spot and not a person was present, the stores all boarded!</p>
<p>And make no mistake about it - - the high crime rate astronomical associated with the black and Dee in particular is why &#8220;white flight&#8221; occurred. A growth industry in DEE is the moving of caskets of deceased loved ones from the &#8220;inner city&#8221; to the suburbs [far away] as the danger of EVEN VISITING A CEMETERY IN DEE IS SO GREAT TO THE VISITORS!</p>
<p>A crime rate no abated even with diminishing numbers of residents in DEE.</p>
<p>In  &mdash;  dee-d, the scientists have been studying Dee from satellites for over several decades now, and are astonished by the rate by which nature has returned to the environs of Dee, and most amazingly so, WHO got the idea to do such a search in the first place?</p>
<p>Part of the failure of the auto industry in the U.S. is that talented people of whatever skill, engineers, business types, financial experts, electronics folks, etc., will not even venture to take a job in the auto industry? A woman, hearing that she might have to move her family to DEE, will just say no to the husband. The problem with Dee is DEE?</p>

		<p>Another interesting thing. There is a Detroit, Oregon. A sweet little town in the Cascades.  It was started by people from Michigan in 1890. The Original White flight? Another thing, Detroit Michigan started the fall to ruble in the 1950&rsquo;s and Detroit, Oregon had to be completely moved in 1952 due to a reservoir that flooded the original town. <br>
This is amusing from wikipedia:<br>
In - 2010 -, by a vote of 47-37 citizens in Detroit voted down a ballot measure that would have changed the city&rsquo;s name to Detroit Lake, the name of the neighboring reservoir and one of the most visited summer sites in Oregon. The proposal was put forth by a local builder and motel owner, who wanted to disassociate the town from Detroit, Michigan and its close ties to crime, corruption, failing schools and a shaky auto industry. A city councilman in Detroit, Michigan, disagreed with the proposal, saying local residents would have made a big mistake because the Motor City will one day return to its previous glory.</p>

		<p>This is less an issue of race than an issue of Free Trade.</p>
<p>When Milton Friedman and the Free Traders got hold of the US economy and started pumping for globalization and free trade, Congress responded. Profits were higher for Wall Street and American manufacturers fled to Mexico, China and Japan. The Japanese imports killed Detroit. The wealthiest left and only the poor were left behind.</p>
<p>You can see other cities in the North, such as Syracuse, Buffalo and Rochester, in similar, but not so disastrous conditions. Again, the loss of manufacturing because of Free Trade.</p>
<p>Detroit is a monument to Free Trade. Nothing to do with race.</p>

		<p>20:  I&rsquo;m with you on free trade being bad.  But it&rsquo;s been bad for the whole country (save a few pockets).  So why are black sections of major cities the only ones that seem to become violent and wholly unlivable due to the loss of manufacturing? </p>
<p>Everything to do with race.</p>
<p>Note that a lot of big time manufacturing first left heavily black cities for other whiter parts of the United States before it was sent overseas.  The Corvette plant in St. Louis&rsquo;s ghetto didn&rsquo;t move to China or Mexico, but to Bowling Green, Kentucky.</p>

		<p>Cumulatively, the photographs are a powerful and disturbing testament to the glory and the destructive cost of American capitalism</p>
<p> Well you little genius, why then does capitalism still thrive OUTSIDE of Detroit? Well -  up until the Muslim genius moved into the White House anyway.</p>
<p> The collapse of the automobile industry started in the 1950s and reached crisis point in the 1960s and 1970s, due mainly to the demand for cheaper imported cars-</p>
<p>This is an out and out lie! I&rsquo;m old enough to vividly remember the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s and the automobile industry was in high gear during this time, setting records from year to year. Why were other auto plants in the rest of the country still running at near capacity, sometimes 24/7? That&rsquo;s when that old saying came out that said - &#8220;as G.M. goes, so goes the country&#8221;, they don&rsquo;t say things like that about declining industries &#8220;in a crisis&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;No place epitomises the creative and destructive forces of modernity more than Detroit, past and present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What this SHOULD have said is - &#8220;no place epitomises the creative and destructive forces of DIVERSITY more than Detroit, past and present.&rdquo;<br>

<p>Right. And it&rsquo;s just a coincidence that every black area  &mdash;  around the world  &mdash;  eventually ends up looking like Detroit, while white areas do not. </p>
<p>I grew up in Gary, Indiana during the period of it&rsquo;s decline. The economic system stayed the same, but the racial makeup did not.</p>
<p>As far as  the white suburbs being a &#8220;noose&#8221; around Detroit, choking off its economy, isn&rsquo;t it funny that when no whites are present, that fact is blamed for urban decay, but when whites directly surround a black city, that&rsquo;s also blamed for urban decay!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always possible to blame false causes for any problem. In the past, evil spirits were blamed for diseases, and lightening was a punishment from God. Everybody believed these explanations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard and it doesn&rsquo;t take a particular degree of cleverness to come up with false explanations for the world&rsquo;s problems. Nowadays, the problem is urban blight rather than disease, and &#8220;racism&#8221; and other rationalizations have been substituted for evil spirits.</p>

		<p>Detroit is a monument to Free Trade. Nothing to do with race.<p>More diversionary nonsense, this time by an &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; pretending to be a Buchananite.<p>For your information, during a decade when America dominated the world in manufacturing and manufacturing exports and no one had yet heard of trade deficits and &#8220;out-sourcing,&#8221; i.e., the 1950&rsquo;s, the white population of Detroit declined by 23%, while the non-white population increased from 16.1% to 29.1%.  The year of the catastrophic Detroit race riot of 1967, when US manufacturing was still world dominant and foreign car manufacturers had barely made any inroads in the US market as compared to the Big Three US auto manufacturers&rsquo; share, the black population of Detroit was already at 40% of the city&rsquo;s total.<p>The Twelfth Street neighborhood where the 1967 riot started illustrates this baleful pattern of urban decline correlating with increasing black population: &ldquo;Whereas virtually no blacks lived there in 1940 (the area was 98.7% white), the area was over one-third (37.2%) non-white in 1950. By 1960, the proportion of blacks to whites had nearly reversed: only 3.8 percent of the areas residents were white. Given that the first blacks did not move to the area until 1947 and 1948, the area underwent a complete racial transition in little more than a decade.&rdquo; Sugrue 1996:244 The neighborhood suffered the typical deterioration accompanying a transition to majority black population as crime rates rose and commercial establishments on Twelfth Street gave way to pool halls, liquor stores, sleazy bars, pawn shops, and second hand businesses. (Detroit had had a major race riot in June, 1943 as well, during America&rsquo;s involvement in World War II, which no doubt had &#8220;jump-started&#8221; the white flight from the Twelfth Street area.)<p>&#8220;Free trade&#8221; has NOTHING to do with the destruction of Detroit and other black-dominated US cities - the inability of blacks to foster, sustain and maintain a modern, urban, civilized, technocratic community without the presence and stewardship of whites is the cause. Race has EVERYTHING to do with Detroit&rsquo;s ruin, and with America&rsquo;s continuing decline. </p></p></p></p></p>

		<p>in 1950 whites were 27% of the world population, and blacks were 9%, most of the blacks being n africa. just 60 years later it is just reversed. 27% blacks and 8% whites globally. there are now 1 billion blacks in africa, and over 40 million in the usa, with the remaining number in other places. wherever the blacks are located there is violence and destruction, and it is consistent and real. it is so obvious that, just as an apple has its growing rot, so does the human race, and it continues to grow. eventually the other races and cultures will have to make a cold hard decision, either eliminate the rot or perish. the world is only so big, and as long as the rot was small and far away, it was livable. now what? something to think about.</p>

		<p>Whites did not &#8220;leave&#8221; detroit.  Whites were ethnically cleansed from detroit by our communist controlled government.  That is not a euphemism.  MOST people who run our government, top to bottom, are communists these days.  They would force us to live under communism except that communism doesn&rsquo;t actually work.  100% of the time, sooner or later, usually immediately, communism causes a collapse of government followed by a swift hanging of the communists&hellip;.lol.</p>
<p>The US has been an experiment in communism since we were taken over near the end of world war II&hellip;..as in high ranking military like Gen Patton, who knew what was happening, were assassinated.  Politicians (example&hellip;Kennedy) who have tried to stand in the way of our conversion to communism have been assassinated.  The US has become a bizarre amalgam of the remnants of our constitutional republic with communism sewn in patchwork fashion all over the place.   Basically, all of our politicians are communists&hellip;.but just can&rsquo;t quite figure out how to make it work.</p>
<p>Detroit is one of their experiments.  It&rsquo;s also a prime reason why we don&rsquo;t have out in the open communism.  Our politicians fear detroit.  They fear what we would do if large chunks of the US turned into detroit.  Unlike say, britain, I am proud to say their fear is well justified.</p>
<p>Whites were driven out of detroit by murder, rape and torture&hellip;..mayhem on a large scale.  Beatings, robberies and worse&hellip;..with an absolute refusal of our institutions, police, national guard, military, to fight back.</p>
<p>But they certainly were quick to arrest and jail any whites that protected themselves.  The fate of those arrested was grim indeed.  Prisons are basically rapehouses for the worst of feral blacks to torture whites who dare to get out of line.  Everyone knows this.  It&rsquo;s why there isn&rsquo;t white resistance to what has been happening for decades now.  It&rsquo;s why there are no white enclaves in detroit despite being able to buy whole city blocks for like $100.  If you go there, blacks will attack you and the police will laugh in your face.  If you protect yourself, the police will bring to bear whatever force is necessary to take you out, no matter how many are in your group.  You could show up in detroit with 100,000 heavily armed skinheads, carve out a city within a city, clean it up and keep blacks out&hellip;.and sooner or later, our military would clusterbomb it to pieces.  They would literally disengage from afhganistan and iraq to do it.  THAT is how far they would go.</p>
<p>Whites did not &#8220;leave&#8221; detroit.  We were driven out by careful, systematic and totalitarian uneven enforcement of the law.  Crimes against humanity is the term to use here.</p>
<p>For decades and decades, it was taboo to even hint that this was going on.  The worst part about it was widespread attack by brainwashed whites if you mentioned the obvious.  The level of this totalitarianism is sometimes breathtaking to behold.  For example, this specific article itself looks creepy and weird because of the total absence of people.  Are there no people there?  Heck no.  If you were to drive around those neighborhoods, you would see tons of blacks doing lots of bizarre stuff.  But you can&rsquo;t show that part.  You can&rsquo;t show the people because it is obvious that they are all black and even more obvious that they did all the damage you see to those buildings. </p>
<p>At least, with Obama in office, it has become difficult to hide this anymore.  Most whites understand that &#8220;something&#8221; is wrong and they have at least some idea that it has to do with non-whites, especially blacks.  More to the point, it is becoming almost impossible for them to deny that they personally will suffer for it.  For a long, long time now, most whites have had some idea that it was WRONG to be anti-racist.  That such views victimized OTHER whites.  And did not care because it allowed them the illusion of moral superiority without consequences to themselves.  Well, those days are over&hellip;..and EVERYONE is facing the consequences of the sins of the past.</p>
<p>Still resistant to the obvious though.  Not for much longer I think.</p>

If you really want to see what we have lost, try shorpy.com, a website that publishes old photos, largely from the Library of Congress&rsquo; collection.  They&rsquo;re mostly from huge, 8 x 10 inch glass negatives, so the photos are amazingly clear and detailed.  Page after page of 100-year-old city street scenes, showing the way our people used to live, when urban living meant something so different as to be almost unimaginable. It will make you cry - or maybe want to scream with anger.  Lots of images of Detroit, from the days when it was called the Paris of the West because of its beautiful buildings, when its residents had the highest per capita income of any U.S. city.  </p>
<p>I remember seeing one photo in particular of downtown Detroit circa 1915, which resembled its modern-day location about as much as Zimbabwe resembles Rhodesia, and the commenters to the site were innocently remarking on how beautiful and bustling Detroit had been - clean, orderly, safe - magnificent buildings, gracious public squares with statues and fountains, convenient public transportation, lots of commerce going on, crowds of happy, purposeful, prosperous-looking, well-dressed people going peacefully about their business.  Until the inevitable angry black commenter showed up, complaining about how there were no black faces in those happy crowds, and what we were all really saying was that we preferred the city the way it was when it was white, and wished it still *were* white.  The polite white folks refrained from replying to him, but I&rsquo;m sure I wasn&rsquo;t the only one thinking, &#8220;Well, of course we prefer that!  Who wouldn&rsquo;t?!&#8221;      </p>

<p>Oh, I see.   At first,  I didn&rsquo;t &#8220;get&#8221; it. I wondered why on earth The Guardian  (of all papers!) would print an article like this.  Amazing. </p>
<p>Ah, yes. Whites are responsible for destroying their own city, just in order to be mean to blacks.   Wouldn&rsquo;t you know?  It&rsquo;s always Whitey&rsquo;s fault!  Those poor, pathetic blacks   &mdash;  - they have been FORCED to live the way they are by mean, selfish whites.</p>
<p>A few years ago I saw on the BBC a similar caustic documentary about Detroit. It was full of indignation that Detroit&rsquo;s inhabitants have been compelled to live amid ruins and squalor.  (Who made the ruins and squalor?)</p>
<p>I happened to be in Quebec during Hurricane Katrina. The French magazines (from France) were all full of photos and teary sympathy for the cruel way the helpless blacks of New Orleans had been abandoned to their fate by the heartless whites who all fled. </p>
<p>The British  and French MSM can scoff and scorn right now, but little do they realize how close they are to getting their own home-grown  &#8220;teaching moment&#8221;.  It can&rsquo;t be long off. </p>
<p>Europe is tottering on the brink. Yet they still posture as morally superior and criticize America  while their own Armageddon is aproaching.</p>
<p>That picture of the Michigan Central Station (New York Central RR) really hit home.  I remember that station when very young  and still recall it as a grand and impressive palace.  Now, it&rsquo;s a  crumbling ruin! </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no authority, but I doubt the story&rsquo;s claim that the blight began in the &rsquo;50s.  More likely, I think, with the race riots in the mid to late  &rsquo;60s and thereafter.<br>

		<p>I was born in Detroit, as was my mother, and I disagree in the most emphatic terms with the commenter who states the city&rsquo;s destruction has nothing to do with race.  It is entirely about race.    We whites were ethnically cleansed from the city.   The destruction of Detroit has not a thing to do with any economic or political ideology or business cycle.  Those are the symptoms, not the sickness. <br>
It is absolutely, entirely and completely due to the black plague.  It is ALL about race.  <br>
If white people do not realize that soon,  white people will be completely and utterly destroyed, everywhere.  Made as extinct in the rest of North America as they have been in Haiti and Detroit.  </p>

		<p>This is in the far left <i>Guardian</i>, so blacks get a pass.  The decline of Detroit is attributed solely to two things:</p>
<p><i>Cumulatively, the photographs are a powerful and disturbing testament to the glory and the destructive cost of American capitalism</i></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><i>The so called &#8220;white flight&#8221; from the city centre began in the 1950s and, soon, as Sugrue puts it, &#8220;an increasingly black city was surrounded by a ring of communities that were all white&#8221;. This &#8220;white noose&#8221;, as one contemporary observer referred to it, helped strangle the inner city, both economically and socially, turning it into a series of large ghettos intercut by freeway.</i></p>
<p>So the presence of white communities outside of Detroit somehow killed the city.  The black population of the city itself had nothing to do with it.  The war that black gangs waged against cops in the 1970s (the gangs won) played no role in the current decline.  That is how the left thinks.  Now suppose we had a 90% white city and around it there happened to be suburbs occupied by middle class Chinese and Japanese.  Does anyone think for a moment that the city would be &#8220;strangled&#8221; as a result?  Reverse that   &mdash;   put the Asians in the city and the whites in the suburbs.  Again, does anyone think the Asians would be &#8220;strangled&#8221; by the white suburbs?  Just plug other races into the leftists&rsquo; equations and you can see how nonsensical they are.</p>
<p>Yes, globalism played a major role in the creation of the rust belt.  But having to employ a black work force under threat of anti-discrimination law was one of the major factors encouraging our stateless corporations to seek overseas labor.  You&rsquo;ll note that they moved their manufacturing to Asia and Mexico, not Haiti or Gabon, even though the labor in the black countries is cheaper than that in Asia or Mexico.  A semiconductor manufacturer might place its next billion dollar fabrication plant in Shanghai rather than New York in order to save on labor costs, but it certainly won&rsquo;t be stupid enough to place the plant in Nigeria.</p>

		<p>The really eerie thing about the ruins is the way valuable property, like pianos, was simply abandoned in the buildings, as if the occupiers fled in haste from war or plague.  A couple of  problems with the analysis by Anonymous at 8:42 - the poor and middle class fled before the wealthy, Detroit&rsquo;s decline was palpable by the late 60s at the latest, particularly after the riots in &#8216;67, when the auto and other industries were still quite robust.  Detroit was ethnically cleansed by fanatical Liberal ideologues who unleashed black racist terrorists on the white population, while preventing that population from protecting itself as a group.  Imagine the government importing several thousand al-Qaida terrorists into a city and telling the local population &#8220;We don&rsquo;t intend to do anything about them as a group, but we&rsquo;ll arrest the individuals who are stupid enough to be caught - you&rsquo;re allowed to defend yourself as an individual from this terrorist group, if you can, but you&rsquo;d better not defend yourselves as a group, or else.  You&rsquo;re on your own.&#8221;  The result would be Detroit. </p>

		<p>In just a few years of WW2, many European cities were deliberately devastated by bombs, fire, shelling and gunfire. London, Coventry, Berlin, Dresden and Stalingrad are a well known few. All these cities have now been rebuilt. Hiroshima and Nagasaki experienced Atomic Bombs but the next day, the inter-city trains to and from Hiroshima were operating. There are no European cities anywhere that have simply being abandoned to rot and be regularly looted and torched by their own citizens over a period of several decades. No American city was bombed during WW2 and the economy along with the lifestyle of citizens blossomed. In 1842 Haiti suffered a massive earthquake and during international relief operations following the 2010 quake, much evidence of the damage from the first was still evident. Wonderful cities built by Europeans all over Africa and under control of Black Africans for the past 50 or 60 years are, just like Detroit, simply falling to pieces with Blacks content to squat in the ruins. The transport of Black African slaves to work the cotton and tobacco plantations of USA was obviously a huge mistake. At that time, there were many thousands of White farmers, smiths, carpenters and similar skilled or even unskilled labour in Britain who would have jumped at the chance for free passage to America to work the fields for no pay, build their own homes, grow their own veg patch and raise chickens &amp; pigs. It&rsquo;s a sure bet that within the first year, these innovative people would have invented easier ways to pick and process cotton and so benefited themselves and their temporary masters. There would have been no civil war. Ah, but it&rsquo;s too late now. The genie is out of the bottle and is too numerous and well-fed to put back. In Haiti, the population burns it&rsquo;s own people as witches for spreading disease whilst queuing for free cholera shots and content to stand ankle deep in their own slowly flowing human sewage. Could all this be the start of Armageddon and the end of times?</p>

&#8220;If the 1967 riots essentially left blacks on their own -with- a city environment in which to prosper, why didn&rsquo;t they? It&rsquo;s not the white&rsquo;s fault. Rather it is the fact that blacks, with a mean IQ of 87 cannot produce a substantial enough mid/upper class (IQ 115 and above), socially conformist, highly dedicated, professional body to sustain -any- kind of independently civilized population mass.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Anonymous #20: Nothing could be further from the truth. It was free trade that built Detroit and it was black rule, infused with socialism that destroyed it. Since 1979, the manufacturing workforce has shrunk by 40 percent, and it will probably continue to shrink because of high taxes, regulations &amp; litigation (the weapons of the modern socialist). It&rsquo;s not cheap labor that sends jobs overseas but the socialist/stupidity of our own government, which views capitalism &amp; free trade as an evil. This, of course, is the view of most of the left-wing in congress and state houses across the US. It is also the view of the photographers of this latest book on Detroit and the blacks who destroyed this once great city. Businesses go where they are treated well. White capitalism was mugged in Detroit by those who wanted to redistribute the wealth. The inevitable results have been repeated over and over again across nations and cultures. Will we never learn?</p>

<p>Then why is Pittsburgh not in the same condition as Detroit? Could it be that Detroit is completely black run and is over 80% black while Pittsburgh is still white run and only about 20% black?</p>
<p>Indeed, I&rsquo;d say the fact that over half the workers at some American car makers in Detroit were black has to be a cause of the decline in quality of American cars. Hiring by affirmative action comes with a big price.</p>

		<p>Detroit is a study in social Darwinism.  When crime and bad behavior reach a certain, smarter people with foresight move out (or never move in).  The question is how were the corrosive elements of that society allowed to get to the tipping point where wealth producers were forced to leave? There was no &#8220;suburban noose&#8221; rather folks that wouldn&rsquo;t be victimized and got up and left Detroit.  Suburbs are the result of folk moving for a better life.   </p>

I see your point. I&rsquo;m not familar with Rochester and Syracuse&rsquo;s demograpics but I know that Buffalo has s sizeable Black population and a pretty serious crime problem. It&rsquo;d be interesting to investigate a city that has a similar problem as the above mentioned vis a vis the loss of manufacturing but with a prodominantly White population and to determine whether there is an equally serious crime issue.</p>

		<p>What a tragic, telling legacy, encompassing the entire country. The natural progression of society is obvious enough, but when you go to importing millions of varied races unlike yourself, doom is the only potential outcome. Particularly when virtually all of those varied races behave like the animals that reasonable people are trying to escape from.  Apparently white history (regardless of the beauty, its meaning or the effort that went into it,) is non-existent, or at the very least, trivial, because the country is going to bizarre (and devastatingly expensive) lengths to preserve any stick or stone that can be connected to the &#8216;egregious issue of slavery&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I would encourage people to watch to 20-minute video on Detroit linked to above. It is eye-opening for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First, it is a perfect example of mid-1960s American ways of thinking. Back then, we had all the answers to all the problems. All we needed was the right men (note the non PC terminology even among lefties back then) with the right planning and everything would be perfect.</p>
<p>Second, it is hilarious to see the mayor of Detroit talking about how his city was experiencing a renaissance and that it&rsquo;s best days lay ahead. Just the opposite was true as two years later, the blacks started their ethnic cleansing in earnest.</p>
<p>Third, we hear all the talk of how white America needs racial diversity to &#8220;enrich&#8221; it. Yet in 1965, these poor, dull whites managed to have modern architecture, schools, colleges, music, art, nightlife, churches, plays, movies, museums, sports, restaurants and all other sorts of cultural activities despite living in a nation that was 90% white. How strange that they all seemed to be loving life and having fun despite their whiteness!</p>
<p>Of course, the date of this film (1965) leapt out at me. That was the year we changed our immigration laws to ensure that 85% of all immigrants would come from the Third World. But the destruction of Detroit would have happened without the Third World as elements of our own population - American blacks - bear 100% of the responsibility for the destruction of Detroit.</p>
<p>Another thought is that Detroit was very diverse as evidenced by some festival the film showed. Poles, Frenchmen, Lithuanians, Germans, Italians, Greeks, Lebanese Christians, Irish, Scandinavians, WASPS, Slovaks and others all seemed to get along just fine in Detroit. Yet somehow we needed to be enriched by the Third World and by American blacks.</p>

		<p>Polish Town was a section of Detroit that was forcibly taken by GM (Government Motors) &amp; the US Government to provide &#8220;jobs for the inner city&#8221; (translation: blacks). It was a neighborhood that was there for several generations. It was stable and its people were hard-working. I bet that the plant that is there now is operating with a skeleton crew of our favorite people. Boycott GM! Boycott Ford (Ford Foundation = LaRaza). Buy Japanese cars. At least we know that they hate us!</p>

		<p>What a cover-up for the blacks.</p>
<p>My parents were born and raised in Detroit. </p>
<p>After the riots the blacks elected a black racist mayor who repeatedly ordered whites to &#8220;move north of 8 mile&#8221; (out of his city) and fired white cops, closed libraries, and looted the city funds. The whites got the hint and left.</p>
<p>He refused to take any action in black on white crime, and used constant hate terms towards whites. He was reelected again and again. When he died another racist, and another. The feds stepped in and have charged the most recent mayor, who also would proclaim his hate of whites, with looting funds from the water company.</p>
<p>Blacks enjoy living like that. They enjoy leaders who do that. We gave them a city, and they have made it the way the like to live. Stop crying that it somehow was forced on them. They are living as they please, the same way they lived in every other former white area they have taken over around the world. </p>
<p>It is just their way, and no amount of pretend time will make them white people with darker skins.</p>

		<p>Having graduated from a private, Jesuit law school in the Detroit area, the three years that I spent in Metro Detroit were three years of &#8220;looking over my shoulder.&#8221;  I recall fellow classmates giving me &#8220;urban survival skills&#8221; (I was a naive white boy from suburban Western New York State) including the direction to stop briefly at red lights when driving at night within the city.  The City of Detroit has deteriorated much further during the ensuing 1995-2010 period.  Detroit may be like much of urban America during the balance of the 21st. century, if America even holds together as one nation.</p>

		<p>#44, you mention that there are no people in the photos.  I found a gallery of photos from the book, online, and did find a vista from what seems to be a tenth-story window, looking down a downtown street.  There actually WERE a good many people, but not cars.  And the people were dispersed in a strange sort of way: not mostly on the sidewalks, but rather evenly-spaced&hellip;as if they were afraid to be in proximity to one another.  Actually, their spacing was reminiscent of a Zombie movie, more than anything else.  Most of them were walking (or meandering&hellip;or maybe staggering) in the middle of the street.</p>

		<p>&#8220;American blacks - bear 100% of the responsibility for the destruction of Detroit.&#8221;</p>
<p>If white liberals were to pass a law requiring all homes to leave cheese out on the floor, would it be fair to blame the mice for invading the home, breeding, and ruining it?</p>
<p>People in 1965 did not get the PC version of history that is taught now to children. They knew this would happen. White liberals did it anyway.</p>
<p>Regarding the free trade debate: While I do not deny that some industries have been hurt by it (Steel and Autos, for example), countries with low trade barriers are almost always richer than protectionist countries. Note how protectionism keep Japan in the dark ages until Admiral Perry opened their ports or how the Netherlands was the richest country in Europe around 1600 because of it&rsquo;s lack of trade barriers. </p>
<p>Besides, the problems of the steel/auto industries are probably caused by lower quality workers. </p>

<p>Notice how foreign auto manufactures that have opened up plants in the U.S. have all done so in the mountain south - not in the big southern cities like Birmingham or Memphis, and not in the old plantation bottom-land like the black-belt of Alabama or along the Mississippi.  Now what is it about the southern hill country that Toyota and Mercedes Benz find so desirable?  What exactly does it have?  Or perhaps, what exactly does it not have?</p>

When whites do it, it&rsquo;s racist;  when blacks do it, it&rsquo;s seeking a better life. The problem is other blacks follow in their wake.</p>

		<p>What is never mentioned about Detroit, even among racial realists is the extent to which welfare is responsible for this.</p>
<p>Blacks are essentially an enemy army that attacks whites.  What they are doing isn&rsquo;t really crime&hellip;.it&rsquo;s warfare.  Like any army, it needs a supply chain.  That is the one unbreakable rule of warfare.  An army ceases to exist when its supply chain is broken.  It&rsquo;s literally how Hitler lost WWII.  He ran out of gas (excuse the pun) and his war machine wound down and stopped.</p>
<p>Well let me ask you something.  Do you see any oil refineries in Detroit?  Any farms large enough to feed more than a token number of people?  Does Detroit produce anything with which to trade for these things?  What percentage of blacks in Detroit have a job that pays enough for basic necessities as opposed to being completely dependent on welfare?</p>
<p>My point is that Detroit isn&rsquo;t something that just happened.  It takes a lot of effort to maintain the war machine that keeps Detroit the way it is.  The supply chain is enormous.  Welfare provides that supply chain and always has.</p>
<p>What would happen if you cut that supply chain by say, making all welfare illegal.</p>
<p>Detroit would burn (like it doesn&rsquo;t burn on a regular basis already).  There would be mass chaos (more than usual).  A handful would leave but most would starve to death, unwilling to move and convinced that they are entitled to have what they want and need handed directly to them by white slaves.</p>
<p>A few years later, there would be no blacks in Detroit&hellip;..and it would be rebuilt by whites.</p>
<p>Something to think about.  The communist monster has a very sensitive Achilles heel&hellip;..if we have a mind to go after it.</p>

		<p>Re #54 &amp; #55   &mdash;   Interestingly, the same thing occurred in the British Isles after the Romans withdrew and the Angles, Saxons &amp; Jutes took over. The stone Roman buildings &amp; infrastructure were left unoccupied/unused &amp; fell into ruin, as the Celto-Germanic folks seem to have considered them almost accursed &amp; avoided them in favor of their own traditional homes made of sticks &amp; mud. Roads, plumbing, aqueducts all were abandoned &amp; fell into disrepair. What followed was the Middle Ages, when hygiene &amp; technology fell to levels far below Previous standards. So while race certainly does have something to do with it, I think culture, ideals/ideology &amp; the motivating force of hatred for the ways of one&rsquo;s conquerors also play a big part.</p>

		<p>The decision to offshore the US manufacturing base is the prime reason for Detroit lay in ruins. In fact, whole swaths of the US midwest have also been devastated by decisions to offshore the US manufacturing base - decisions made by whites, not blacks.</p>
<p>However, it seems the offshoring of the US manufacturing base, which was centered in the midwest, was but a harbinger. Today entire service sectors of the US economy are being outsourced to India - mostly.</p>
<p>Who is making the call to outsource medical, legal, technical services, etc to India? Who makes the decision to fire US workers and import lower cost, and docile, H1Bs from India? </p>
<p>Sure isn&rsquo;t blacks. Correlation does not equal causation.</p>
<p>Bottom line; let&rsquo;s stop letting white people who betray their own for profit (Judases) off the hook by blaming blacks - not that there isn&rsquo;t much to blame blacks for.</p>

<p>&#8221; (Detroit had had a major race riot in June, 1943 as well, during America&rsquo;s involvement in World War II, which no doubt had &ldquo;jump-started&rdquo; the white flight from the Twelfth Street area.&#8221;</p>
<p>I scanned through all these posts hoping to find a reference to the riots of 1943.  I have a senior cousin who was in Detroit at the time.  Recently, we were discussing Detroit.  She told me about the riots.  They seemed to make a big impression on her.  She said that what happened was that blacks were imported to Detroit from the South for the purpose of working in the large wartime industry doing on there.  Many whites were also brought in.  The homes for the blacks were shabby, uninsulated and without plumbing.  After a couple years and everyone else getting upgraded quarters, the blacks rioted.  She says that at that time the black settlement was somewhat isolated, so that few could see them.  The blacks burned down these shacks to force the government to build new, better ones.  I also have to report that in California where I grew up, we had a similar shanty town called &#8220;Splinter City&#8221; where blacks were similarly imported from the South and put to work.  The name of the settlement was appropriate for all that I have gathered about it.  A community grew up near the old settlement.  By the time I was growing up, living about 20 miles away, everyone knew to stay away from there.  We were separated by a very large air force base.</p>
<p>War always changes society.  WW2 caused more social cataclysms than any other in history.  Government disfunction in peacetime is not unusual and during wartime is normal, especially when it comes to preserving prewar social order.  Moving populations around, especially black populations was a huge mistake then.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that this really changes the fact that black population concentrations produce poor results, but I think it is important information none-the-less.</p>

<p>It was multi-cult propaganda circa 1965; mercifully it only occupies a few seconds in the vid. But apparently even back then we were most obsessed with diversity. <br>
___________________</p>
<p>That brings to mind a very  similar piece of propaganda that used to be repeated over and over on the official NYC  radio station.</p>
<p>Yes, the obsession with pushing  diversity goes way back. We had little idea, back then, what it would lead to. It seemed innocent enough. But I remember that the constant repetition of that mantra about the wonders of diversity got on my nerves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cities in the Roman Empire must have looked like this after the barbarians occupied them. &#8220;</p>
<p>Crack a book once in a while.  The Germanic &#8220;barbarians&#8221; actually did not destroy the Roman Empire.  The Visigothic king Odoacer deposed the partly German Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus on Sept. 4, 476.  Odoacer was already leader of the Roman army.  The popular myth of Goths running wild in Rome, lobbing heads off statues is just that, a myth.  And it is a Christian myth.  Most attacks on temples and statues were done by early Christians, who sometimes attacked old pagan temples and statues, including those of emperors (because they were often proclaimed &#8220;gods&#8221;).  Just as in the earlier case where scripture was forged to ascribe the crucifixion of Jesus to Jews rather than a noted cruel Pilate (who was recalled to Rome for his cruel rule in Judea), Christians had to blame someone else for destruction later on when enough civilization returned for some cultural embarrassment to register against the fledgling Roman Church.  Christians also burnt books, destroyed literature and produced greater illiteracy in Rome than had previously existed.  This allowed for the rise of superstition which combined with worsened health care and poverty to produce a fanatical belief in &#8220;end times&#8221; and other radical Christian claims and expectations.  It is no surprise that one poster on this column conjures up questions of &#8220;The Apocalypse;&#8221; it has been trained into the Western psyche since the advent of Christianity.</p>
<p>I know I post historical and religious commentary on Amren posts often, but the lack of actual European historical and cultural knowledge among typical posters is appalling.  How can such people expect to save a race when they have such a poor and misinformed education concerning it?</p>

Sweden has unions and liberal economics, yet its cities weren&rsquo;t third world replicates (until they started importing Africans).

		<p>I wish to second Anonymous #20 that Detroit is foremost a victim of free trade  &mdash;  i.e., the art of hiking taxes on domestic manufacturing (making them more expensive) to pay for government in order to allow foreign products to be tariff-free and hence cheaper.</p>
<p>While crime rates, corruption, etc., are undoubtably much higher in Detroit than they would be if the demographics were different, the city would still be in poor shape due to free trade, outsourcing of white-collar jobs overseas and replacement of American works due to H1-B and other job-killing visas.  And it&rsquo;s not of course just free trade but also EEOC Naziism where companies face millions in fines every time they look at a minority the wrong way  &mdash;  this causes companies to move every job they can overseas to avoid these lawsuits.  </p>
<p>We would be making a mistake if we overlooked free trade policies, overseas job outsourcing, and EEOC lawsuit abuse in order to just point at the demographics of Detroit being the main problem.  Racial demographics are not just a cause of poverty but an effect of them, if a city has no jobs around just those living on welfare, primarily minorities, will tend to remain in the city.  That&rsquo;s why cities that have improving economic opportunities incur gentrification (return of whites and wealthier minorities.)<br>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>The same phenonom of decay and abandonment can be seen in Kansas City  [Missouri] &hellip; (perhaps not quite so bad and on a smaller scale).  Much of the once bustling downtown is a wasteland,  a desert.  By now, a great deal of it has been leveled.  As you say, the shoddy buildings of today do not compare with the quality of those  built up to WW2.  KC has spendid old Art Deco buildings    &mdash;   hotels and offices   &mdash;   standing abandoned, and many more have been torn down, leaving a sea of  weed-grown empty lots.  Only government offices remain, and a few  tenacious corporations.  Everyone flees at 5PM on Friday.</p>
<p>Over the weekends  when city hall, the banks and courts are closed, it is populated only by derelicts who will spot you from blocks away and come running to mooch a quarter.  Otherwise, it is a graveyard.  There are no stores, no restaurants; there is no place to buy anything.  The last department store closed some years ago when all the shoppers moved out to the malls. Now, even the malls are being invaded by the same undesirable elements that ruined downtown and  they are closing too, while the whites flee further out into Kansas.  </p>
<p>The whites everywhere, all over America, are like a helpless flock of sheep, fleeing in panic before the wolves. They don&rsquo;t organize or fight back, all they can  do is run   &mdash;  - from one place to another.  It&rsquo;s not really their fault; that&rsquo;s all their government allows them to do. (And the government is working on that, planting pockets of Diversity in every white area across America.)</p>
<p>As for Kansas City, <i>Kansas, </i> that is so far gone that it is beyond even mentioning. It couldn&rsquo;t even be called a &#8220;city&#8221; anymore. Just a lot of desolation and weeds.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been  back to in KC in several years now. I understand there is a movement to revitalize it &hellip;(doesn&rsquo;t every city have such a well intentioned plan?).   Good luck with that!   But I fear that it will never succeed, no matter how much public money they throw at it, until they  face and deal in a realistic way with the &hellip; &#8220;underlying problems&#8221;.   And  given the ruling ideology in America today,  and the racial realities,  we all know they are not going to do that!  No time soon. </p>

The Visigothic king Odoacer deposed the partly German Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus on Sept. 4, 476. Odoacer was already leader of the Roman army. The popular myth of Goths running wild in Rome, lobbing heads off statues is just that, a myth.<br>
______________________________</p>
<p>Thank you. You are absolutely right. Despite the myth of the barbarians going berserk, of destructive &#8220;vandalism&#8221; [from Vandals} etc., the fact is that when Rome collapsed internally, the so-called &#8220;barbarians&#8221; inherited the mess and kept it going, more or less, as best they could. They were already established in many high positions, and simply took over.  The Visigoths in Iberia, the Franks in Gaul and Germania actually took charge and preserved what was left of the Roman Empire in the West. Charlemagne saw himself as the preserver and protector of the Empire and  even had himself crowned in Rome by the Pope as emperor of the new &#8220;Holy Roman Empire&#8221;   &mdash;   the first Roman emperor since Augustulus. (The Franks were by that time Christians themselves.)</p>
<p>PS. Thanks also to #63 Franz for the reference to those prescient paintings by Thomas Cole, a painter I was not familiar with. People back then should have paid him more heed. No doubt they thought it was just artistic fantasy. If only they could see Detroit now!</p>

		<p>There is at least one other website dealing with the ruins of Detroit, and it started before these two came over and did their shtick (website and now book).</p>
<p>Google &#8220;the fabulous ruins of Detroit&#8221; and see which website comes up.  There was an artist fellow who took a large number of pictures of ruins (industrial buildings, hotels, and residential stuff too).  I think the website was sold off, and it may be called &#8220;Detroit Yes&#8221; now.  </p>
<p>I was born in Dearborn in 1953, and lived in various suburbs of Detroit until 1963, when my father moved us all down to Miami, Florida.  I remember some of the places which are now ruined.  I used to go skating at Belle Isle in the winter.  </p>
<p>When I was a kid, I had no idea that Detroit had been a very rich city.  My father worked for Ford Motor Company for some years, but we didn&rsquo;t consider ourselves rich.</p>
<p>One of the places we lived was Oak Park&hellip; I have heard that over the years, there was white flight out of that suburb, and then eventually the area re-gentrified and at least some whites came back. </p>
<p>I think that race and politics have a lot to do with the destruction of Detroit, but there are other things too.  Consider the effect of all the tariffs and union rules on the automobile industry&hellip; they make it more expensive to hire native-born workers than to just ship those jobs overseas, and they were one big reason why foreign automobiles captured a big portion of the U.S. market.  </p>
<p>Consider how CHEAP some of the foreign autos were (until tariffs were raised on them)&hellip; up until sometime in 1973, you could buy a brand-new (old) VW Beetle for less than $3,000.  By the time they stopped importing them here, they were over $10,000&hellip; not such a bargain anymore. </p>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;m living in an area of Los Angeles County which has too many blacks for my taste&hellip; when we finally get out of California (hopefully this year), we&rsquo;re going to base our decision at least partly on demograhics.  Fortunately we will be bringing jobs with us, so we won&rsquo;t have to go to another big city and worry about which sections are full of diversity!</p>

Nothing could be further from the truth. It was free trade that built Detroit and it was black rule, infused with socialism that destroyed it</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Why does it have to be either/or?  I can agree with both positions.</p>
<p>There doesn&rsquo;t have to be just one cause. I would see it as a combination of both.</p>

		<p>The problem with the posts of #20 and #98 is that essentially, it is the same rhetoric of the Congressional Black Caucus, Van Jones, Obama and the New Black Panther Party for that matter (it was the free trade or capitalism of the white man, not the behavior of blacks that killed Detroit). The obvious question, posted by others, is why haven&rsquo;t cities with majority white populations also been destroyed by &#8220;free trade?&#8221; Consider the point also brought up by another poster: Honda could have purchased an old factory in Detroit for $1. Instead they spent close to one hundred million dollars on building new ones in the southern(overwhelmingly white)hills of Ohio &amp; Indiana. Facts are troubling things.</p>

<p>I agree. Blaming unions or liberal economic redistributionist policies for the decline of Detroit is as stupid as poster 20 above blaming free trade. Sweden has unions and liberal economics, yet its cities weren&rsquo;t third world replicates (until they started importing Africans). There used to be high rise public housing projects all over Europe, and unlike their American analogues, they weren&rsquo;t a host to pandemic crime and violence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all race.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I think that thanks to organized labor within high value-added assembly line manufacturing like the automobile industry, the modern working middle class (i.e. as opposed to a bourgeoise), was born in Detroit.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
The New Deal was only possible because civil rights legislation was not on the agenda. Blacks benefited as lower income people; they did not benefit in ways that harmed lower income whites.<br>
 <br>
European Social Democracy only works where nearly everyone is white. I hope the European Social Democrats discover that in time. </p>

		<p>A few posters above keep comparing this to the Germanic tribes destroying Roman architecture.  Well, we all know what came about eventually, don&rsquo;t we?  Europe obviously hasn&rsquo;t been negatively impacted by Germanic peoples in the long run. </p>
<p>Why even make such a comparison? All it does is causes infighting on here. One person above wants to interject that it was &#8220;Christians&#8221; who destroyed everything. What history books are all of you reading? </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how the Muslims destroyed things, and the Mongols;  or let&rsquo;s stay on topic and talk about how blacks always bring civilization down everywhere they go. To compare the Germanic tribes of Northern Europe, or Christians, to these people is laughable. Christian whites aren&rsquo;t the problem and neither are Germanic whites, obviously.</p>

		<p>The decision to offshore the US manufacturing base is the prime reason for Detroit lay in ruins. In fact, whole swaths of the US midwest have also been devastated by decisions to offshore the US manufacturing base - decisions made by whites, not blacks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After decades of socialism and no effort to keep the magnificent buildings of the unscathed by war cities  like Prague in good repair, I looked at the faded glory in &#8216;89. they looked gnawed on by the tooth of time, very much so, in lack of paint. The lack of funds did not make Pragers demolish them.  What you see in Detroit is wanton destruction by utter foolishness. You can be poor, but neat and clean does not cost anything. Did they have an earthquake that turned a grand piano upside down? What kind of mentality destroys magnificance and blames it on poverty and no work? Germans were out of work during the Weimar republic and so dirt poor people went hungry. Did they turn to making huge messes of their cities? Blaming things of this nature on poverty is the worst cop out and despicable.  You can blame it on poverty that there is no fresh paint on the walls, the floors are not polished and no thermopane windows installed. You can not blame it on poverty that windows are shot out, you can not blame dirt, senseless destruction on poverty. Were those places left open to all and sundry?  How did they get in?   It is sad beyond words, and the saddest to hear stupid whites making excuses for them. I can have nothing but contempt for them, the whites that is. The blacks, well you can not milk a turkey buzzard, what can you expect.  </p>

		<p>I scanned through all these posts hoping to find a reference to the riots of 1943. I have a senior cousin who was in Detroit at the time. Recently, we were discussing Detroit. She told me about the riots. They seemed to make a big impression on her. She said that what happened was that blacks were imported to Detroit from the South for the purpose of working in the large wartime industry doing on there.   &mdash;  -Posted by whiteplight @ 5:02 pm, 7 Jan.</p>
<p>Indeed.  Much if not most of the racial tension before the 1943 &#8220;Belle Isle&#8221; riot was caused by Federal efforts to place housing for blacks in or near white neighborhoods.  They built one such complex, provocatively naming it after the black abolitionist Sojourner Truth, and began renting to blacks in early 1942.  Local whites protested, causing a mini-riot that presaged the more serious and extensive 1943 riot.  FDR had his Attorney General send investigators to Detroit to see if the white protesters could be indicted for conspiracy, then settled for a show of military force to intimidate the whites. </p>
<p>The Federal government has been in the business of forced racial integration for a long time.  One could even make the case that it was the ultimate culprit behind Detroit&rsquo;s ruin.</p>

<p>As for America:  The Ruins of Detroit today, which city will be next?</p>
<p>And there will be many &#8220;nexts&#8221; as city after city falls to barbarian invaders as they did in the Old Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Many beautiful buildings and structures in Los Angeles are also being destroyed, covered with graffiti and left to the elements:</p>
<p>The following will become <i>normal</i> all across the land:</p>
<p><i>A 1972 designation couldn&rsquo;t save this rare and fine example of Italianate Victorian Los Angeles architecture. Deteriorated and vandalized to the Nth degree, it was demolished the following spring.</i></p>
<p>And, race has <b>everything</b> to do with the abandonment of Detroit by the Whites that built it:</p>
<p><i>[Detroit&rsquo;s] auto industry began slumping in the mid-1950s &mdash;  just as poor Southern blacks were pouring into the city&hellip;<b>Massive federal, state, and private aid showered on Detroit, but the city&rsquo;s downward spiral only worsened.</b> </i></p>
<p><i>Coleman Young preached revival&hellip;and hiked taxes on middle- and higher-income residents, helping speed white flight. A refrain grew in Detroit&rsquo;s white neighborhoods, and in the suburbs that ringed it, that Young wanted it to be a black city.</i> </p>
<p><i>The charge gained credence with the razing of the city&rsquo;s Poletown neighborhood, an enclave of ethnic whites&hellip;. &#8216;The night air was always smoke-filled and people slept with guns nearby,&rsquo; wrote George Cosetti, a documentary filmmaker on hand at the time. &#8216;City services became almost nonexistent&rsquo;&hellip;. The murder rate rose 1000 percent between 1950 and 1990. Welfare became the single largest employer.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/236nvqq" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/236nvqq</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good enough for me!  I&rsquo;d be outta there too.</p>
<p>Detroit is a city gone mad, starting at the highest levels of the city&rsquo;s government, producing nothing but a drain on the national treasury.</p>
<p>And this will and is happening all across the US as Whites are ethnically cleansed from the cities they built.</p>
<p>As for the end of the Roman Empire:</p>
<p><i>In England for two hundred years after 400 AD, the record is almost blank; by 600 AD so little of it remained that historians today are unable to prove it existed at all during that 200 year period.</i></p>
<p><i>The beautiful city of Bath was flattened as if it had been hit by an atomic bomb. By the end of the Middle Ages the site had reverted to woodland so completely that there was no sign a city had ever been there.  Not a brick, not a statue, nothing remained above ground.  An archeologist discovered the remains of Bath accidentally while digging in 1755.</i></p>
<p><i>Of all the hundreds of Roman cities and towns, not one survived the barbarism intact.</i></p>

		<p>The answer might be so simple, yet Federal Laws do not permit the now worthless and abandoned areas of Detroit to be purchased and thereafter populated by those of only European descent. It may thus remain for this area to be sold to a foreign government such as China that can do just that, but in their case, make sure it is only those of Chinese descent.</p>
