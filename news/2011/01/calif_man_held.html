<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41247131/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/">Calif. Man Held Over Infamous Massacre During Guatemala&rsquo;s 1982 Civil War</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, January 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Southern California martial arts instructor suspected of being involved in a 1982 massacre during a civil war in Guatemala was arrested in Canada and is awaiting extradition to the U.S., it was reported Monday. </p>
<p>Suspect Jorge Sosa was arrested last week while visiting his parents in Alberta, Canada, the Riverside Press-Enterprise said.</p>
<p>Sosa, 52, was indicted in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana in September after authorities said he lied about his role in the civil war when he applied for U.S. citizenship in 2008.</p>
<p>Sosa was granted citizenship, but it was revoked after the grand jury indictment. He lives in Moreno Valley.</p>
<p>If convicted, Sosa could be sentenced to a maximum of 15 years in federal prison and would then be deported, Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office in Los Angeles told the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>In Guatemala, Sosa was a member of a special military unit called the &#8220;Kaibiles&#8221; and was the commanding officer of a unit assigned to find and arrest guerrillas who had stolen military weapons, according to court documents.</p>
<p>On Dec. 7, 1982, he and several dozen soldiers stormed the village of Dos Erres, near Las Cruces, and systematically killed the men, women and children, the government claims in the indictment. </p>
<p>The unit is accused of slaughtering villagers with sledgehammers and throwing people into a well.</p>

		<p>I spent a summer in Guatamala about 15 years ago (very cheap language schools). I enjoyed it, but the country makes Mexico look like a first world country.</p>
<p>The CIA managed a coup in 1954 against democratically elected leftist president Jacobo Arbenz and installed a dictator, Castillo Armas, and for several decades after that the country was under a terrible oppression (the village mentioned in this article was one of over 400 villages that suffered the same fate). That period had passed when I was there, but the family I lived with still shut the windows and lowered their voices before timorously answering any of my inconsiderate questions about the period.</p>
<p>The left focuses all of its attention on the contribution that first world governments and corporations have made to making third world countries basket cases, and white nationalists tend to focus all their attention on the contribution that inhabitants of third world countries have made to making their countries basket cases.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the proportion of the two contributions varies from country to country, but I&#8221;m also pretty sure that it&rsquo;s just about always a mixture of both contributions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that the left NEVER recognizes that the large American companies that the Guatemala 1954 coup allowed to continue their operations unimpeded also brought the telephones, highways, cars, televisions etc. that a large number of Guatemalans enjoyed when I was there.</p>
<p>Che Guevara (possibly Fidel too; I can&rsquo;t remember) was in Guatemala during the time of the coup there, and Guevara and the Cubans learned the right lesson from the coup, and the CIA learned the wrong lesson.</p>
<p>The Cubans learned that if you&rsquo;re going to maintain a leftist gov&rsquo;t against the Yankees, it has to be a totalitarian gov&rsquo;t with no democratic institutions of the sort that allow for easy subversion, and with a strong military formed from supporters of your regime.</p>
<p>The CIA learned that Latin American governments were a pushover, and planned the Bay of Pigs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a simple picture that leaves out a lot of things, but at least it&rsquo;s a basic framework with a few facts hung on it that maybe aren&rsquo;t too frequently seen here.</p>

		<p>Sounds like this guy is a White Hispanic and he should be made in charge of dealing with the M13 Mestizo gang bangers not doing a reign of terror in Southern California and other places in the USA. These M13 gang bangers are mostly Central American indians, who left Salvador and Guatamala supposedly to escape war and poverty, but they just brought the same lifestyle they had then as marxist guerilas and simply made the adaptations to American anti White gang members. Right wing military units work better on these types than the US criminal justice system.</p>
