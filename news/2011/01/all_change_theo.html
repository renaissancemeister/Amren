			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Clive Finlayson, BBC News, December 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For over 150 years the name &#8220;Neanderthal&#8221; has been household property.</p>
<p>And it has become associated with dim-witted, ape-like brutes that scurried across vast ice-covered wastes waiting for the day when our ancestors  &mdash;  the intelligent and modern humans  &mdash;  would wipe them from the face of the Earth.</p>
<p>Now, we have discovered the Denisovans and I wonder what image we will choose to give them.</p>
<p>But there are already hints that suggest that the status quo will prevail and we will find reasons for making these people a little bit less clever than our direct ancestors.</p>
<p>The irony is that the scientific community is going to have to come round to the acceptance that the Denisovans and the Neanderthals also belonged to the species which we call Homo sapiens.</p>
<p>The Denisovans, for that is how we must know them (for now as the authors of a recent paper in Nature have preferred not to give them a scientific name), lived in southern Siberia.</p>
<p>We do not know how much further their range extended but it seems highly unlikely that they were confined to this region alone.</p>
<p>The site in which their remains were found seems to have been occupied over two periods, one older than 50,000 years ago and the other between 30,000 and 23,000 years ago.</p>
<p>It seems that it is not possible at this stage to determine whether the Denisovans occupied the site in one or other period, or both. Either way they must have lived close to Neanderthals or our own ancestors, depending on which time period they lived in.</p>
<p>An earlier study already showed that Neanderthals contributed a percentage of their genome to some of us, right across Eurasia from the west to the extreme south-east.</p>
<p>The present study shows that the Denisovans were closer genetically to the Neanderthals than to us but that we all shared a remote common ancestor.</p>
<p><b>Reality check </b></p>
<p>The Denisovans do not seem to have contributed much to the European gene pool but their genes made it all the way into that of the Melanesians.</p>
<p>Put together, this evidence shows us that humans formed an interwoven network of populations with varying degrees of gene flow between them. Some humans may have looked quite different from each other, revealing a combination of adaptation to local environments and genetic drift, but it does seem as though those differences were not large enough to prevent genetic interchange.</p>
<p>DNA from ancient remains shows the Denisovans shared a common ancestor with Neanderthals</p>
<p>I have suggested that humans, at any point in time in our evolutionary history, behaved as a polytypic species; they consisted of an array of regional populations clustered into geographical races which had not achieved independent species status  &mdash;  they could exchange genes when they met.</p>
<p>And this is not a new idea either. The great evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr proposed it for the human species as far back as 1950! An obsession with turning each new fossil into a distinct species has clouded the biological reality that we are now retrieving.</p>
<p>One aspect of the findings of this recent study shows that the Neanderthals experienced a severe genetic bottleneck in the course of their history which means that their overall genetic diversity was much lower than that of present-day humans.</p>
<p>The Denisovans seem to have escaped the bottleneck too. Now, the interesting point for me is that the bottleneck, affecting all Neanderthals, was an ancient one.</p>
<p>It predated the arrival of modern humans into Eurasia and thus must have been the result of an ecological impact and not competition.</p>
<p>This conclusion is exactly what I have been predicting over the past decade, that Neanderthal populations were in decline for a long time and well before the arrival of modern humans.</p>
<p><b>Food for thought</b></p>
<p>Almost concurrently with the Denisova findings, a paper published in the US Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal looked at an unusual case  &mdash;  a family group of Neanderthals who lived in northern Spain and whose remains were preserved.</p>
<p>These Neanderthals from El Sidrón have provided DNA that reveals that the males were very similar to each other but the females were not. The conclusion is that Neanderthals were patrilocal  &mdash;  the males stayed put while the females wandered between clans and tribes.</p>
<p>Researchers have retrieved DNA from a Neanderthal family found at El Sidron cave.</p>
<p>What is more, these Neanderthals lived in small groups with low genetic diversity. Added to the Denisova paper findings, we can begin to understand the population biology of the Neanderthals. As I have suggested previously, their populations became heavily fragmented and gene flow between them became reduced.</p>
<p>They were in crisis but not because of the arrival of modern humans. Like pandas today they were in danger of extinction.</p>
<p>They were not in such danger because they were ape-like brutes either. A paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has provided conclusive evidence that Neanderthals regularly ate plants and even cooked them before eating them!</p>
<p>A detailed study of Neanderthal teeth from Spy in Belgium and Shanidar in Iraq found traces of plant matter including grass seed starches that had been cooked. We had suspected that Neanderthals consumed plants for some time, and it was logical to do so, but now we have the evidence.</p>
<p>So those who claimed that Neanderthals only ate meat, an almost physiological impossibility, have to rethink their argument.</p>
<p><b>Seafood platter</b></p>
<p>In 2008, we published evidence of marine mammal and mollusc consumption by Neanderthals in Gorham&rsquo;s Cave, also in the PNAS journal. I have been arguing that omnivory is a defining characteristic of the genus Homo, including the Neanderthals, and these latest findings have confirmed this conclusion.</p>
<p>So the Neanderthals weren&rsquo;t stupid apes but humans, and they interbred with our own ancestors. Yet they were affected by environmental perturbation and went extinct.</p>
<p>This is a lesson for us all to learn. But in spite of the evidence there are those who will resist. A hallmark, for the archaeologists, of modern humanity has been the Upper Palaeolithic technology.</p>
<p>In recent years the boundary between this technology and its makers has become increasingly diffuse and I would argue that technology can no longer be used as proxy for human taxa.</p>
<p>Now, the findings at Denisova have included typically Upper Palaeolithic technology. It would be ironic if we were to establish that it was the Denisovans, not modern humans, who had made them.</p>
<p>But the authors of the Denisova paper are unsure of the association between the bones and the tools and have opted for &#8220;the reasonable hypothesis that the phalanx and molar belong to the older occupation&#8221;.</p>
<p>In other words the Denisovans lived prior to 50,000 years ago and the tools were made between 30,000 and 23,000 years ago by invisible humans.</p>

		<p>These so called DNA &#8220;experts&#8221; had said for a long time that there WAS NO intermingling between the Neanderthals and the &#8220;humans&#8221;.</p>
<p>NOW not only mixing between Neanderthal and &#8220;human&#8221;, but another group as well of humanoids. And mixed with modern type humans as well. </p>
<p>And then the Hobbits from Flores Island. NEVER before even known about. NOT even suspected to have existed until just a few years ago. WHAT ELSE out there we know nothing about?</p>
<p>So the &#8220;experts&#8221; with their definitive studies were not totally correct, were they?</p>
<p>And constantly more and more will be found. NEW discoveries all the time change the paradigm and the perspective.</p>
<p>That &#8220;caveman&#8221; diet consisted of meats of all types, root crops, fruit, eggs. NO dairy and NO grain. The &#8220;caveman&#8221; lived well and thrived on such a diet.</p>

<p><br>
Why assume the females &#8220;wandered&#8221; about a lot? Is he trying to be obtuse?  More likely, they were captured from other clans or traded as booty, spoils of war. The defeated males were simply killed off, the females were brought home.</p>
<p>This is not at all unlike the way Arabs and Africans have behaved within their own cultures. It exists among some groups even today. The females are kept as slaves and concubines; the males are just killed.  </p>
<p>(Way back then, they were probably eaten too. Was any trace of that found in their teeth? Why no mention?)</p>

		<p>Read &#8216;Total Man&rsquo; by Stan Gooch. This guy used psychology, folklore and linguistics with archaeology &amp; anthropology only in passing to prove in the early 70s that Eurasians had a small but significant % of Archaic Human ancestry compared to Africans. I&rsquo;m counting on Haplogroup I, found only in the Balkans and Scandinavia and nowhere in Africa or even beyond Europe, will be proven to be pre-African</p>

<p>Well, there&rsquo;s always the idea that it&rsquo;s the white mind that isn&rsquo;t as far-evolved. Leftists probably do promote that idea when possible.</p>

A comedian once did a bit about scientist finding a fossil of a fish with an overbite. It was the only one they found and they gave it a unique name and classification.</p>
<p>The comedian wondered how the scientist could make assumptions from one fish. Maybe, he suggested, that this fish wasn&rsquo;t typical of it&rsquo;s species but was a fish that had an overbite. Hence, he thought the name of the fish should be the Dork Fish.</p>
<p>I remember when I was young hearing about the Neanderthals being described as ignorant, clumsy, awkward oafs. Even then I wondered, &#8216;how did they know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much we don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t know. Much is assumptions and speculations.</p>

		<p>#2 stated accepted opinion: Males usually lived and died in one tribe; the females were moved from group to group, as booty or trade (not of their own choice). The fact that Finlayson does not state this, tells me that this is not a science essay, but liberal propaganda.</p>

		<p>the out of africa theory is a lie. Humans developed in isolation. Caucasians diverged from homo africanus and homo sapiens africanus a million years ago. We are more removed from homo africanus than chimpanzees are from orangutans</p>

		<p> This kinda kills the out of Africa theory. The neandrathals larger heads allowed our ancestors to develope larger brains and the African didn&rsquo;t interbreed with them thus explaining the relative I.Q. differences between them and Europeans.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The females wandered from tribe to tribe.&#8221; Indeed they were liberated cave ladies who had thrown off paleolithic patriarchy! Perhaps they fought the saber toothed cat and hunted the mammoth as well. It&rsquo;s far more likely the females were a valuable commodity that was exchanged, rustled or taken as war booty.<br>
   The story needs further PC airbrushing: I await the arrival by glider or hot air balloon of a highly intelligent African, who teaches the filthy cave dwellers alleyoops the advanced arts of cave painting, big game hunting, jewelery production, and tool making.</p>
<p>The homo sapiens-neanderthal scenario would seem to indicate that all groups have common ancestry since &#8220;out of Africa&#8221; except the sub-Saharan Africans.  </p>

		<p>Taking women from other groups doesn&rsquo;t have to be only through killing. <br>
The Neanderthals lived in small groups and often in very difficult times (glaciations), therefore having after fight out of sudden an increase in females in the group while perhaps losing a male hunter or two wouldn&rsquo;t be a reasonable strategy. I&rsquo;ve read somewhere that Amerindian groups of the same or related tribes organized meetings, where brides were swapped among families. Maybe the Neanderthals used similar method for refreshing the group gene pool.</p>

		<p>Nevertheless, stripped from its political connotations, these are very interesting archeological findings. I wonder what other surprises lie in store for us beneath mother Earth. </p>
<p>Same with many findings made by space probes and other areas of scientific endeavor. There are some fantastic clips on youtube on space exploration.</p>
<p>One must not get so involved in politics so as to loose your wonder for some real science being done. Life is much too short for that.</p>
