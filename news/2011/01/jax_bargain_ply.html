<h1>Jax Bargain Plywood Ad Racist?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WJXT-TV (Jacksonville, Florida), January 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rachel Baldwin is defending her company&rsquo;s new commercial that has gone viral for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>The Jax Bargain Plywood ad has received more than 4,000 hits on YouTube and is the subject of jokes on Comedy Central.</p>
<p>Ruth Taylor, a woman in the commercial, sings: &#8220;Save me a nickel. Save me a dime. Jax Bargain Plywood can do it every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bloggers claim the jingle contains the &#8220;N&#8221; word.</p>
<p>&#8220;The e-mails that we&rsquo;ve gotten are that we are being racist,&#8221; Baldwin said. &#8220;They can&rsquo;t believe we got an African-American woman to say that. They&rsquo;re making a lot of derogatory comments about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baldwin said she&rsquo;s disgusted at the growing number of online comments targeting her staff and Taylor, who&rsquo;s a Gospel singer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Taylor said in a phone interview Friday that the allegations are ridiculous, even moreso because she herself is black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Customers admit Taylor&rsquo;s pronunciation could have been more precise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not everybody puts the ending on her words. So that&rsquo;s what it sounds like,&#8221; one customer said.</p>
<p>The owners said they have no intention of pulling the commercial from the air or adjusting the audio. Instead, they&rsquo;re going to continue to sell their plywood, cabinets and tile, saying they have nothing to be sorry for.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>In the context in which it&rsquo;s being used, the &#8220;N-word&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t even make sense. The word &#8220;nickel&#8221; does. Chalk this whole ruckus up to the unnatural position to which we&rsquo;ve elevated the &#8220;N-word&#8221;. It&rsquo;s literally the only word in America that no one is permitted to use anymore. And why? Because those whom it describes have been elevated to an unnatural position in our society.</p>

		<p>Hilarious!! This story has it all - affected black hysteria over what MAY BE a word many of them use a hundred times a day; a classic example of &#8220;ebonic&#8221; pronunciation gone awry; and all of it topped off with odd explanations of why any of this either is or isn&rsquo;t offensive in the first place!  </p>

Does anyone else recall the graduation card that refereed to &#8216;black holes&rsquo; but was heard wrongly by blacks?</p>
<p>Maybe this is a hearing issue. Maybe black brains and white brains process auditory signals differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as good an explanation as any other theory.</p>

I&rsquo;ve watched the video a couple times and I believe the singer has enunciation issues. This is a common trait among blacks.</p>

		<p>I have spent some time around Jacksonville and the impression I came away with is that there aren&rsquo;t a lot of Blacks in that city who buy a lot of plywood or other building materials. Tools aren&rsquo;t exactly user friendly to the average soft and smooth liberal. So why do the folks at Bargain Plywood care what anybody thinks.</p>
<p>The longer White continue to bend over frontwards to please Blacks and their White rah-rah team, the more ingrained the habit will become.</p>

		<p>What would be the motivate for this hate crime?  Jax is so racist they&rsquo;ll slip a nonsensical racial slur into a commercial they paid to broadcast&hellip; just for the sake of getting away with using a derogatory term on the air?  Sort of like children taking delight in swearing over the P.A. system at Wal-Mart?</p>

		<p>A hospital I worked at was slowly in the incremental process of banning smoking.<br>
The nicotine gum, given out as a substitute that the nurses dispensed, was name-branded &#8220;Nicorette.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though I&rsquo;d noticed the similarity ages ago, it wasn&rsquo;t until a patient slurred the word that it became obvious to the primarily black staff. There was good-natured whoopin&rsquo; and hollerin&rsquo; galore.<br>
Oddly enough, they waited for me (the token white,) to laugh with them before they reached their cackling crescendo.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed the word &#8216;bigger&rsquo; sounds a bit like the &#8216;N&rsquo; word. I work in retail clothing&hellip; Although once, I had a customer say &#8216;excuse me&rsquo; when I wasn&rsquo;t really saying anything close to the &#8216;N&rsquo; word. It took me a moment to realize what the customer Meant by &#8216;excuse me&rsquo;. They thought something I said sounded like the &#8216;N&rsquo; word. It&rsquo;s not something I think about or that effects me to much, though perhaps I should try to avoid using the word &#8216;bigger&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Years ago when my daughter was in college she worked for Richway, which has since become Target. She told us about a black girl at the service desk making the announcements asking for help in &#8220;Heff an&rsquo; BOO-ay.&#8221;  Over and over you heard calls for &#8220;Heff an&rsquo; BOO-ay.&#8221; The &#8216;Health and Beauty&rsquo; department to this day in our house is &#8220;Heff and BOO-ay&#8221;.

		<p>All this controversy could have been avoided if the owners had gotten somebody white - even a schoolgirl - to sing the jingle.</p>
<p>BTW, this Bantu singer didn&rsquo;t use the N-word, but she sang like her mouth was full of mush. That&rsquo;s the worst pronunciation of the word &#8220;nickel&#8221; I ever heard. Just like the word &#8220;whore&#8221;. Bantus mispronounce it and call it &#8220;hoes&#8221; - a garden tool.</p>

		<p>Notice the sick, slick, sneaky anti-white propaganda in the beginning of the video, in the form of an ad for the Mormon Church of all people, that features a saintly black man who changes the diapers of a light-skinned baby. </p>
<p>Why is that baby so light skinned we ask? But then the puppet masters show us, in a one-second shot of a blond woman who is obviously the baby&rsquo;s mother. </p>

		<p>I say boycott these folks!!! They support everyone except the good ol USA. The TILE is shipped from over seas, the cabinets are shipped from China, They sell 2nd and 3rd grade plywood for a dollar less than other competetors and everything else I would not patch a dog house with and the so called Blonde owner is the walking definition of dumb blonde. Shop around folks better deals are at flea markets and on Craigslist and chunky dumb blondes are a dime a 6pack</p>

		<p>so next are they going to bury mushmouth-ing and ebonics ? and start actually speaking English ? I thought the commercial was entertaining, to say the least.<br>
