			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daisy Hernandez, National Public Radio, January 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I wasn&rsquo;t the only person on Saturday who rushed to her Android when news came of the Tucson shooting. I wasn&rsquo;t looking however to read about what had happened. My auntie had already filled me in  &mdash;  &#147;Someone tried to murder una representante. People have been killed,&#8221; she&rsquo;d reported. What I wanted to know was the killer&rsquo;s surname. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say there was a collective sigh of brown relief when the Tucson killer turned out to be a gringo. Had the shooter been Latino, media pundits wouldn&rsquo;t be discussing the impact of nasty politics on a young man this week  &mdash;  they&rsquo;d be demanding an even more stringent anti-immigrant policy. The new members of the House would be stepping over each other to propose new legislation for more guns on the border, more mothers to be deported, and more employers to be penalized for hiring brown people. {snip}<br>
In short, the only reason the nation is taking a few days to reflect on the animosity in politics today is precisely that the shooter was not Latino.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s painfully ironic that a gay Latino man came to the aid of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in the storm of gunfire. Daniel Hernandez [no relation], an intern with the congresswoman, ran to Rep. Giffords and helped to stop the bleeding. If a judge hadn&rsquo;t blocked provisions of Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070 law, the intern&rsquo;s surname would have easily qualified him as a target for police under different circumstances on Saturday. {snip}<br>

<p>&gt; Giffords was a Democrat and she hired a Hispanic on purpose.  Had the intern been white, I am sure that intern would have performed just as well.  The intern did not brave a &#8220;storm of gunfire.&#8221;  The gunfire lasted only a few seconds.  Hispanics always seek self-aggrandizing language when describing themselves and obvious denigrating language, &#8220;I&#8221;m glad he wasn&rsquo;t a &#8220;gringo&#8221; when describing whites.</p>

<p><br>
The reality is much different. The nation has better things to worry about than waste time about a group of people which will never integrate and become part of the existing Euro-based society and that has caused wide-spread White Flight,pain and suffering to millions.</p>
<p>Moreover, Daisy Hernandez, should know something about history before making unsustantiated linguistic, cultural claims. </p>
<p>The homosexual man (not gay-Gay is a Latin name meaning Happy))who supposedly helped Congresswoman Giffords after the shooting by a maniac is NOT A &#8220;LATINO&rsquo;. He is an Ibero-Indian whose origins maybe in a continent called by the French &#8220;Amerique Latine&#8221; (Latin America).<br>
The following are Latins: The Italians, French,Romanians,Spaniards and Portuguese.</p>
<p>Sorry Daisy!  </p>

<p>If he were an illegal mestizo, news coverage would have been considerably less, and the radical sheriff of Pima County wouldn&rsquo;t have launched into a tirade against everybody on the right, unless he wanted to blame them for &#8220;driving&#8221; the alien to do what he did, because they don&rsquo;t favor amnesty. <br>

		<p>Naturally, she is permitted to, and feels obliged to, use a slur to describe white Americans, but God forbid a white American uses a slur on (you name it) -Americans.  That person would be pilloried, fired, driven from the airwaves, and probably denounced from Congress and threatened with death.  Commentators like her make me glad that I no longer contribute to public radio after having done so for decades.</p>

		<p> I listened to this while driving home from work the other day. This gringo was offended. I guess the opinion piece by the white conservative Christian expressing relief that the shooter was part Jewish and liked The Communist Manifesto will be broadcast at a later date. It is interesting to read the 500 comments to this on the NPR website. Most of them could have been written by anyone here.</p>

<p>If a shooter acted alone, he&rsquo;s usually white.  Non-whites tend to act in pairs, in gangs, or in mobs.  Not always of course, but as a general rule.  I knew this guy was probably white when I read the headline. </p>

		<p>Sheesh. Maybe it&rsquo;s a mistake to let them learn English.</p>
<p>If the word &#8220;gringo&#8221; is a slur, it&rsquo;s probably a very mild one. I doubt it&rsquo;s a slur at all in many circumstances. But trying to find out from a Mexican exactly how he feels about the word (or about most things) is something that only a gringo would attempt.</p>
<p>In the village I stayed in, they quickly found out that I didn&rsquo;t like the word, and that was the end of any possibility of my finding out what their own feelings were about it. They were much too polite to discuss with me any subject that was irritating to me. The purpose of conversation was to produce pleasure, not to analyze, and lying was also acceptable if that would increase the pleasure of all concerned.</p>
<p>We Americans pretty much have had the custom of facing reality, rather than constructing magical alternatives to it. I like Mexico and Mexicans, usually a lot, but I don&rsquo;t want to see their culture take strong root here. Having such different cultures under the same polity makes no sense.</p>

		<p>Daisy Hernandez is simply no different than the United States House of Representative Luis V. Gutierrez form Illinois: They are for their people.  These Mexicans are able to threaten with riot, use terms of description to which they chose, define our laws as good and bad, etc. with no fear of retribution or reprisal.  Plainly stated, they are Mexicans looking out for other Mexicans.  Also it may be that the perpetrator of the killings was not European American/European, after all, but of another race.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be refreshing and uplifting to have an unashamed, racially proud, and unapologetic European American/European politician with our best interest at heart?   </p>

<p>Besides being a racial slur, it sounds like liberals and non whites hate when something bad happens if it means pinning them to it.  Would Daisy Hernandez being as &#8216;relieved&rsquo; had he killed a bunch of hispanics?</p>

<p>True, but we&rsquo;ve been fighting against Hispanic invaders for years now.  We would have and will still be stopping the invasion from south of the border.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because Gifford gave jobs to hispanics who plan on taking over our country.  Blacks and browns tolerate whites who fight to give them goodies and privileges.  </p>

<p>I used the term &#8220;Gringo&#8221; on a forum about a year ago and was admonished by a Latina that I probably didn&rsquo;t realize that the term was used throughout Latin America as a severe insult.</p>
<p>However, we were treated with deference when we stayed in out of the way places in Mexico, but I&rsquo;ve no doubt it was due to the fact everyone was hoping to get money from us, one way or another.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; and &#8216;Latino&rsquo; are already ambiguous terms for such a diverse group. Now they can all enjoy to not have a <i>burden</i> like heritage on their back with the term &#8216;brown.&rsquo; The sad thing about all the anti-racists is that they won&rsquo;t sniff out a problem with this racial ambiguity in name calling, this ambiguity that destroys races. In fact, they applaud the <b>meager</b> differences of people through color alone. It&rsquo;s not about merit, it&rsquo;s not about the people that are fostered within the group, the ones who represent your people&rsquo;s achievement through the ages, the ones who push further and harder. No, it&rsquo;s about petty outward appearance. A true hipster culture ours is.</p>

   Tell the &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; who speak a form of Spanish but mostly give allegiance to Mexico, that they and all the immigrants are the gringos, not the native born citizens who are natives.<br>
   Gringo means foreigner and native citizens are NOT foreigners in any nation. <br>
   My family has long considered itself only American. All speak English and all are aware that most of our ancestors came directly from Spain and were acquired with the territory of Florida in 1820.<br>

		<p>#17 I read your link. Nowhere in the article you posted is there any evidence that Loughner is not Jewish. In an interview with Nick Baumann at Mother Jones published on Monday, Bryce Tierney, a friend of Jared Loughner, claimed Loughner&rsquo;s mother, Amy Loughner was Jewish. Jared Lee Loughner may be Jewish, partially ethnically Jewish or not Jewish at all. It is not known at this point. The link you posted admits this much if you read it carefully, although it certainly attempts steer the reader away from this conclusion. </p>
<p>also see here: <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=250185" rel="nofollow">http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId;=250185</a></p>
<p>Whether Loughner is Jewish or not he is certifiably crazy. His writings seem schizophrenic. Honestly, I am not really sure why his ethnicity matters.<br>

<p>I think that you&rsquo;re over generalizing. There are many Hispanics that are fine, loyal Americans.<br>
&#8220;Barbarian&#8221; comes from the Latin &#8220;barbus&#8221; meaning beard. It  refers to the facial hair worn by the various tribes e.g. Vandals, Suevi, Huns etc.</p>

<p>It matters because Jewish organizations were screaming that Giffords was targeted BECAUSE she is Jewish, blaming anti-semitic, gentile America for the carnage.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor himself and AmRen took a lot of heat: </p>

		<p>#23  If you took your own advice, you would see that the article does indeed negate Loughner&rsquo;s alleged Jewish connection. The author of the above link did extensive research on the shooter&rsquo;s family tree and came up with no Judaic tie; if you have found solid evidence to contradict the latter, please share the data.  <br>
  </p>
<p> His ethnicity is indeed important to antisemites of the &#8220;Stormfront&#8221; and &#8220;David Duke&#8221; variety.
