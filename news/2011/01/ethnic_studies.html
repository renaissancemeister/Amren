<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A controversial Arizona law targeting ethnic studies in public schools will take effect come midnight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law bans classes that promote the overthrow of the United States government and resentment toward a race or class of people. Also outlawed are courses designed primarily for students of a particular ethnic group and those that advocate ethnic solidarity rather than treat students as individuals.</p>
<p>In Arizona, critics claim that the law  &mdash;  along with the partially suspended immigration law  &mdash;  threatens to make the state a &#8220;new South&#8221; of discrimination against minorities. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For his part, Tom Horne, the force behind the Arizona law, says ethnic studies serve to divide rather than unite. &#8220;Fundamentally, I think it&rsquo;s wrong to divide students by race,&#8221; says Mr. Horne, the outgoing Arizona schools superintendent, who was elected state attorney general in November.</p>
<p>The program teaches &#8220;one-sided propaganda&#8221; and is inconsistent with American values, he adds</p>
<p>Horne helped draft the law in response to complaints about a program that teaches Mexican-American history and culture in the Tucson Unified School District, the city&rsquo;s largest with more than 50,000 students. He plans to announce Monday the district is in violation of the law. It will be his last day in that office.</p>
<p><b>District defends program</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the risk of losing state funds, the district plans to keep its program. Officials believe it is in compliance with the law. &#8220;The law was created listing the things that a course of studies cannot do, and the district&rsquo;s position all along has been that this course of studies does not do that,&#8221; says Pedicone.</p>
<p>Once Horne declares the district is breaking the new law, school officials have 60 days to present evidence of compliance at a hearing, Pedicone says. The ultimate decision rests with Horne&rsquo;s successor, John Huppenthal, a Republican senator from the Phoenix area who also has been critical of ethnic studies both at the Tucson district and at the University of Arizona.</p>

A lot of young, white liberal females aid and abet this stuff and I can&rsquo;t stand it but keep my mouth shut because I need a job.  </p>

		<p>Why the devil is a law that outlaws promoting the overthrow of the US government and resentment towards a particular race or class &#8220;controversial&#8221;?!!! And I just love that little line in the article claiming that the state&rsquo;s immigration law and this new ethnic studies ban makes AZ the &#8220;new south.&#8221; Liberals love trotting out that nonsense whenever whites try to protect their own group&rsquo;s interests the same way minorities so vigorously do. I&rsquo;m not surprised this left-wing tripe came from the christain science monitor, they&rsquo;re always printing garbage meant to &#8220;uplift&#8221; and &#8220;empower&#8221; minorities and at the same time stick it to whitey. </p>

<p>In short, this law outlaws multiculturalism and the Marxist-Leninism that inspired it. Maoism also gets it in the neck too, oh what a pity!</p>
<p>This is a very clever law, as it does not outright advocate for white rights and aspirations, but simply eviscerates the multicultural construct of destruction in the reverse. Certainly the fecklessly wretched on the other side start their Red whine and Communist cheese party about &ldquo;discrimination against minorities,&rdquo; but that is a &ldquo;happening&rdquo; that has gone on for almost 7 decades now, or longer. It isn&rsquo;t the best they can come up with, it is the only argument they can come up with.</p>
<p>It seems to be finally losing its little rosy Red glimmer?</p>
<p>May God let it be so, I say!</p>

<p>Do you believe there is a politician or any other &#8216;lawmaker&rsquo; alive willing to enforce  this new law?</p>
<p>In the end it will be a  Pyrrhic victory after all, win the battle, lose the war and all those other clichés (rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, a finger in the dike&hellip; you should avoid clichés like the plague!) because as long as the southern border remains wide open laws such as banning ethnic classes will be ignored if not overturned.</p>
<p>You can be sure there will NEVER be White studies classes (well, unless they are about how Whites are the Cancer of the World).</p>
<p>And, maybe classes that promote overthrowing the US aren&rsquo;t such a bad thing&hellip;</p>

		<p>Good for Arizona! Ethnic studies classes that &#8220;promote the overthrow of the U.S. government and resentment toward a race or class of people&#8221; should be law in all fifty states. It should be a FEDERAL LAW.</p>
<p>But the fact that a state alone has to enact a law like this shows how far our government has let us down. The ACLU and all civil liberty organizations, and all forms of the U.S. media should be up in arms at the treason shown our country from illegal immigrants and the overt racism committed against the white race. </p>
<p>Since when did it become OK to promote the treasonous policies that are taught in U.S. schools, now beginning at the elementary school level? Bad enough when the teaching of this Marxist tripe was started decades ago at the college level. And whatever happened to &#8220;do unto others as you would have done unto you&#8221;?</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it a hallmark of an overthrow of a government to rob a certain section of a population of its collective voice? The first thing Mao did in China with the communist overthrow was murder all the learned and professional people so that who remained could be led like sheep. And to think our own government is aiding and abetting this is an atrocity.</p>
<p>And as Jay wrote in the first post of this article &#8220;a lot of young, white liberal females aid and abet this stuff&#8221; where he works. Unfortunately, so do a lot of white males. We&rsquo;ve read their articles, championing the genocide of their own race. Too many white people with this mind set. If it&rsquo;s not out of fear, which still doesn&rsquo;t make it right, then it has got to be from mental illness, doesn&rsquo;t it? All I know is that it&rsquo;s mind-boggling in its insanity. As John PM would say, God help us all!</p>

Time is running out on our people and our country, as we continue to lose a little more of it each day. These la raza disciples, who deplore White America, do not have to win today; not as long as the border remains wide open and the spawn of illegal invaders continue to receive citizenship. Time is on their side and they know it! They have us treading water and one can only tread water for so long before they run out of legs. </p>
<p>The sun is setting on our glorious race and nobody including those who were elected to represent us seems to have any concern in the matter. Eventually, this battle may have to be fought on another front.</p>
<p>Am I being melodramatic? I&rsquo;m not so sure anymore. These people are playing for keeps. Are we?</p>

		<p>I am an English teacher in Arizona. I have always taught in higher education, but two years ago I taught K-12 at a top-rated charter school in Arizona. </p>
<p>After forcing students for years to ingest and digest Dr. Michael Marting Luther King Jr. (because I was forced to teach them his plagiarized, self-absorbed tripe), I finally said, &#8220;Engough!&#8221; And I began teaching, as we had for years, the Great Classics of English Literature, that is, the stuff written by dead White guys. I went further. I hung attractively framed portraits of Shakespeare and Dickens and Twain on the walls of my classroom. Every day children saw the White faces of those brilliant authors. </p>
<p>My prinicipal was black. She was, of course, constantly opposing everything that I did in the classroom. </p>
<p>Now, I am back in the college classroom. My students DO NOT read the fashionable P.C. mediocrities composed by minority women. We read the best of the best. My textbooks, of course, still focus on race and culture. That may not change as I cannot choose my own texts. However, I do not incorporate ANY discussion of race in my classes. We discuss the enduring human questions, the recurring human drama. And we read the most exemplary works. </p>
<p>And those works (HAMLET, KING LEAR, OLIVER TWIST, LONG DAY&rsquo;S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT, DEATH OF A SALESMAN, et al) just happen to be written by dead Whites. I am proactive about promoting our Great and incomparable culture. If La Raza wants to rumble in the intellectual arena, I say bring it on, Lessers!</p>

		<p>Here is a very good, brief video on Tucson&rsquo;s &#8220;ethnic studies&#8221; course. It features a former ethnic studies teacher in the district, John Ward, who is himself of Hispanic heritage.</p>
<p>This little report serves admirably as a shorthand model for understanding &#8220;ethnic studies&#8221; as a curriculum category, generally speaking. Bear in mind such &#8220;studies&#8221; have proliferated throughout American &#8220;higher: education: </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s truly amazing. Whites are constantly monitored to make sure they are not saying anything racist or offensive to nonwhites. Yet nonwhites can say the most racist offensive statements againts whites. In my personal life, I have had trouble with Mexicans because of their being indoctrinated in the schools and elsewhere. It is wrong for La Raza and other Hispanic supremacist groups to be allowed to foment anger against the white race.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
But isn&rsquo;t it a hallmark of an overthrow of a government to rob a certain section of a population of its collective voice? The first thing Mao did in China with the communist overthrow was murder all the learned and professional people so that who remained could be led like sheep. And to think our own government is aiding and abetting this is an atrocity.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve just replaced one tired, &#8216;evil&rsquo;, symbol with an ideal of grass roots nobility that isn&rsquo;t there at all.  In this, yes, we -are- sheep, particularly here at AmRen, for not reading between the lines and seeing the truth for what it is.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Like the state&rsquo;s tough immigration law – which a federal judge put mostly on hold last summer – the new measure that Gov. Jan Brewer signed in May has sparked protests and legal action, as well as concerns about the future of education. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Controversy over the obvious: shutting down Hispanic race advocacy.  Only politicians and governmedia invent hype over something that isn&rsquo;t controversial at all.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The law bans classes that promote the overthrow of the United States government and resentment toward a race or class of people.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Like whites ought to be doing.  The difference being that it&rsquo;s very hard to convince the next generation, the soldiers, that you need to do something technically against what they are taught 8-9 hours a day by people they imprint on more than they do you.  Children turned in their parents in the 3rd Reich.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Also outlawed are courses designed primarily for students of a particular ethnic group and those that advocate ethnic solidarity rather than treat students as individuals.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Which is the same as saying that the entire white history can now be &#8216;banned&rsquo; as well.  A rather nagging thorn in the side of elites because white history represents the aculturation and accomplishments of the modern world.  Not so great now that Che Guevara is at equal footing with Madison, Franklin, Washington, The Philosophes and Rome is it?</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
In Arizona, critics claim that the law – along with the partially suspended immigration law – threatens to make the state a &#8220;new South&#8221; of discrimination against minorities. Meanwhile, educators in states such as California worry that the law could become a model for other states to follow. </p>
<p>For his part, Tom Horne, the force behind the Arizona law, says ethnic studies serve to divide rather than unite. &ldquo;Fundamentally, I think it&rsquo;s wrong to divide students by race,&rdquo; says Mr. Horne, the outgoing Arizona schools superintendent, who was elected state attorney general in November.</p>
<p>He plans to announce Monday the district is in violation of the law. It will be his last day in that office.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>The guy responsible is headed out the door so the implementation of this law and it&rsquo;s real motivations cannot be disputed or &#8216;historically&rsquo; traced.  How typical of universalism.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Opponents of the law say Horne&rsquo;s actions are politically motivated, and they point out he has never attended a class to learn first-hand about a program that is offered to all students, not just those of Mexican heritage. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The state has no business telling the local school board what to teach,&rdquo; says Roberto Rodriguez, a professor at the University of Arizona and member of the district&rsquo;s Mexican-American studies advisory board. &ldquo;The state superintendent is overreaching – meddling, literally.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Actually, I believe this all started when a substitute teacher got &#8216;immersed&rsquo; in the hispanic ideals o Aztlan and Reconquista up close and personal and decided to video tape it for public consideration.</p>
<p>He was then forceibly denied access to the class he was supposed to be teaching and eventually transfered out.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I trust the fact that hating the U.S. and advocating it&rsquo;s overthrow came from a good source.  Beyond which, however, I don&rsquo;t see why it should be &#8216;controversial&rsquo; if the same approach to videotaping teachers as a means to underline competency and applicability of their course curriculum continues.</p>
<p>Again, this is a setup.  It is a &#8216;look at this hand while the other one performs the sleight&rsquo; as a function of justifying a &#8220;We will allow -no one- to have the freedom of their beliefs by requiring -everyone- to be &#8216;treated as individuals&rsquo;.&#8221; alternative oppression.</p>
<p>Group Advocacy SHOULD be allowed because WE ARE THE DOMINANT GROUP.  Isn&rsquo;t half of what we talk about here our frustration at not being allowed to act in OUR majority best interests?</p>
<p>You cannot apply statistics to individuals.  But you can to groups.  And as a group, whites, in their own lands, as a dominant or even exclusive population majority, have some of the strongest socio-economic, criminal and cultural stability leveraging to recommend their continuing existence as exactly who they are (Finland comes to mind here, Iceland too, until recently).</p>
<p>Mexico, Africa, Most of SWA, Most of SEA.  Do not.  Even where they are equally genetically homogenous.</p>
<p>Why impose on us &#8216;criminal codes&rsquo; that should be better applied to the barbaric and backward in their own lands?  Whites don&rsquo;t want to live there.  Why should we have to accept their grotesque behaviors as justification of totalitarianist &#8216;individualism&rsquo; among us?</p>
<p>Individuals have no political power.  Groups do.  Be careful what you give away when you automatically cheer for what -looks like- pro-white, pro-American, laws.</p>
<p>The States are no less corrupt than Washington.  They are just newer to the public image game.</p>
<p>You are all being played as fools.</p>

		<p>As well as the obvious leftist slant to most ethnic studies courses, there is the practical problem that as society becomes more multi-ethnic, there are too many ethnicities to cover. Even many leftists educators are going to have to concede that covering lots of different perspectives will be too expensive and time consuming for schools and universities to cover.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder students have such a poor knowledge of global geography for example, when they are taught a hodge potch of different cultural perspectives, known of which are taught in depth.</p>

<p>History tells us this is correct. The mestizos,  amrinds and zambos invading our border are an arrogant lot, filled with that mexican pride that really isn&rsquo;t worth a hill of beans. But as correctly mentioned, they are receiving tremendous assistance from the White, progressive left, who hates the White race perhaps more than these mixed breeds violating our sovereignty do. What these malcontents from the left do not realize is that the mestizo does not differentiate politically, just racially. &ldquo;Multiculturism&rdquo; IMHO was the social doctrine implemented by the progressive left to further this invasion and to remove the White race from society. </p>
