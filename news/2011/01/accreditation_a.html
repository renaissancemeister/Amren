<h1>Accreditation Agency Will Visit Wake Schools Next Month</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>T. Keung Hui and Thomas Goldsmith, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), January 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s letter, Mark Elgart, president of Georgia-based AdvancED, officially declined the school system&rsquo;s [Wake County&rsquo;s] conditions for participating in the special review of the school district. Elgart said a review team will come Feb. 17-18 to Raleigh to review allegations of poor governance lodged by the state NAACP against the school board.</p>
<p>The only way to stop the review, which will examine decisions such as the elimination of the use of diversity in student assignment, is for the school board to withdraw membership from AdvancED. But pulling out would cost Wake&rsquo;s 24 high schools their accreditation, potentially making it harder for high school students to gain scholarship and get into some colleges and universities. </p>
<p>&#8220;Providing that the Wake County Board of Education decides to maintain its accreditation we will conduct the visit on February 17-18, 2011 with or without the cooperation of individual board members and professional staff,&#8221; Elgart said in today&rsquo;s letter. {snip}</p>
<p>AdvancED, is investigating Wake&rsquo;s schools in response to an NAACP complaint that alleged the school board was not following its own policies when it took steps to discard the county&rsquo;s practice of balancing schools based on students&rsquo; socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>
<p>But some school board members have complained that AdvancED&rsquo;s review unfairly includes matters that shouldn&rsquo;t affect accreditation.</p>
<p>This week the board even threatened to drop its affiliation with AdvancED.</p>
<p>But on Thursday, the board sent AdvancED a letter asking it to agree to some terms. For Wake to cooperate with the investigation, the board&rsquo;s letter said, the agency would have to:</p>
<p>Agree in advance of the interviews what topics will be covered and what process followed.</p>
<p>Allow school board members and school staffers to have lawyers representing them during the interviews.</p>
<p>Agree in advance on how to handle specific inquiries made during the interviews that relate to litigation and/or are beyond the agreed upon topics.</p>
<p>Advise Wake in advance of the interviews as to what findings relating to the operation of the school board would lead to some change in accreditation status.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything less than a positive response to this letter will force the Board to also consider its continuing relationship with AdvancED,&#8221; said the letter, which was written by school board attorneys Ann Majestic and Jonathan Blumberg.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s letter, Elgart said they couldn&rsquo;t accept those conditions because it would force them to deviate from the polices they use for reviewing other institutions. He accused school leaders of being confrontational.</p>
<p>Elgart said in today&rsquo;s letter that they&rsquo;re focusing on the school board&rsquo;s governance and leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;The focus of the inquiry is to not dictate policy to the Board of Education or to exert control over the governing powers and authorities,&#8221; Elgart writes. &#8220;However, it is designed to help the Board of Education improve their effectiveness so as to benefit the schools for which it governs.&#8221;</p>
<p>AdvancED has asked for information on a wide range of issues such as student assignment, the hiring of attorney Thomas Farr, the naming of the conservative Civitas Institute as a trainer for school board members and the decision not to build a high school on Forestville Road.</p>

		<p>I have a suggestion for all people who are interested in this busing issue.</p>
<p>Why is it always busing blacks to white schools to achieve &#8216;diversity?&rsquo;  When they try to bus white kids to black schools, the whites flood the private schools or move.</p>
<p>Why are the Leftists so focused on integration between only two races?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they try to integrate the other races together (and leave whitey alone)?</p>
<p>Why not bus Asian kids to black schools and viceversa?  Or latinos and blacks? - integrate them!  Or Armenians, Hmong and Bangladeshis together?  Why not bus Somalis to Chinese schools?  </p>
<p>There is a whole other level of &#8216;integration&rsquo; and cultural &#8216;vibrancy&rsquo; just waiting to be explored.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t push this on them and shove their hypocrisy in their face, there will be no more white schools in amerika, save for private schools or schools in rural areas in appalachia.</p>

		<p>I believe that if our country continues on its present course that the mastery of Ebonics that White children gain from going to school with bussed-in Black children will be an invaluable tool in the near future. When an Ebonics-speaking Black student is Affirmative-Actioned through school, college and the personnel office of the business at which your White son or daughter will someday work, how can they win the approval of their Black boss if they don&rsquo;t even speak his native tongue?</p>
<p>Those folks down in Wake County need to quit looking gift horses in the mouth.</p>

<p>AdvanceED&rsquo;s attack on the Wake County school system likely has far more do with enforcing the diversity agenda than to financial ties with the NAACP.</p>
<p>Accreditation bodies are already aggressively enforcing the diversity in higher education. See: </p>

OPENING SENTENCE:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have ever wondered why colleges and universities seem to march in lockstep on controversial issues like affirmative action, here is one reason: Overly politicized accrediting agencies often demand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Accreditation bodies for K-12 schooling are naturally eager to impose the diversity agenda   &mdash;  - which includes socioeconomic (racial) balancing of enrollments   &mdash;  - on the captive clientele of government schools.    </p>

		<p>Dear E Pluribus Pluribus,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment. Very interesting. As a teacher myself, I resent the very idea of accreditation agencies. They are nothing but bureaucratic behemoths that bully schools and teachers, and make stupid administrators feel useful.</p>
<p>One correction, though. I would change your name to &#8220;E Pluribus Plura.&#8221; That would enable the second &#8220;many&#8221; (the Latin of which you are using to replace the word &#8220;unum&#8221;) to match the grammatical case and gender of the &#8220;unum&#8221; which you are replacing, while at the same time still maintaining the plural (as opposed to the singular) number.</p>
