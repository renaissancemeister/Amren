			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Jamieson, @TBDOnFoot, January 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Sunday night, Allen Haywood was randomly and viciously attacked by two kids on the platform of the L&rsquo;Enfant Plaza Metro station. Dozens of people witnessed it. Several people filmed it. Nobody helped.</p>
<p>Haywood was trying to transfer to the Yellow Line around 7:15 p.m. when the assault happened. He was headed home to Fort Totten after working out at Results on Capitol Hill, a gym bag slung over his shoulder and a book in his hands. As he read with his back to the station wall, &#8220;all of a sudden someone whacked me on the back of the head really hard,&#8221; he recalls.</p>
<p>Haywood turned around. The boy looked to be about 11 or 12 years old. Baffled, Haywood asked, &#8220;What the fuck are you doing?&#8221; The boy stood there laughing. Then someone else cracked Haywood from the other side. He turned around again. This time it was the girl in the video above. She didn&rsquo;t stop swinging for more than a full minute, chasing Haywood around the platform as other kids egged her on.</p>
<p>As seen in the video, Haywood repeatedly asked the girl why she was attacking him, pleading with her to end it. &#8220;Stop it! Stop it! Goddamn it! You stop this shit right now! I did nothing to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Haywood looked to strangers for help, but all he saw were other kids with their cell phones out, recording the scene and laughing. Judging from his voice-over, the man shooting the YouTube video above doesn&rsquo;t appear to be part of the group. The video showed up yesterday on Unsuck D.C. Metro, which posted an anonymous account of the attack Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Haywood tried grabbing hold of the girl but she squirmed away. She grabbed his book, which had fallen to the ground, and threw it on the tracks below for no reason. All the while, the cell phones kept rolling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Haywood finally got free and sprinted to the station booth. He banged on the glass and told the station manager to call 911. With gashes and blood on his face, he ran back to the scene of the attack, hoping the kids would be detained. The ones who&rsquo;d delivered the beating were gone, but the kids who&rsquo;d filmed it were still there  &mdash;  and they still had their cell phones in Haywood&rsquo;s face, taunting him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Metro worker arrived on the scene and told Haywood to go upstairs. Haywood said he didn&rsquo;t want to leave, because the kids had evidence of the attack and he wanted them questioned. The worker kept insisting, and Haywood relented. He still doesn&rsquo;t know what happened to the kids.</p>
<p>A transit police officer arrived and took Haywood&rsquo;s statement and photos of his damaged face. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon Haywood returned to L&rsquo;Enfant Plaza. He&rsquo;s convinced the kids have attacked people before and that they&rsquo;ll do it again  &mdash;  &#8220;or maybe worse,&#8221; he says  &mdash;  and he wanted warn people. Though he never thought he&rsquo;d do such a thing, he drew up a sign. It read:</p>
<p>&#8220;I WAS ATTACKED AT L&rsquo;ENFANT METRO SUNDAY AT 7:15 PM. NO ONE HELPED. PLEASE BE CAREFUL.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haywood held up the sign at the Metro entrance in silence for about 45 minutes during the afternoon rush hour, hundreds of strangers spilling past him and onto the escalators. He got a lot of sad looks, plenty of kind words, and even a few hugs.</p>

		<p>L&rsquo;Enfant Plaza is a dreary complex of Federal government buildings in Southwest Washington DC surrounded by a neighborhood that has been dangerous and &#8220;ghetto&#8221; for as long as I can remember.  White people who find themselves in that area have to be on the alert all the time for blacks such as those that gratuitously conducted an unprovoked attack on this young man.</p>

		<p>What makes me sad is that, in the furor of poor little black people self remonstration against &#8216;raciss&rsquo; attitudes; nobody will get the obvious: these kids are carrying more value in their damn phones than they could possibly get off of this man&rsquo;s book or duffle bag and so have -ZERO- excuse of &#8216;racism and SES poverty&rsquo; to justify their hatred.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s baldfaced racial aggression tied to a pack theory jump-from-the-back attack mode.</p>
<p>Throw in a 20% percent edge in testosterone, a two year lead into puberty and a certainty of dominant affirmation in Obama.  As well as a mean IQ of 87 (probably significantly ICY conditions less in this instance), leading to low impulse control once they start.</p>

Forget the gym, this guy needs self defense training. I&rsquo;m not sure that would&rsquo;ve helped though if you don&rsquo;t have the spirit.</p>

		<p>I live near this area and had a discussion with a friend earlier about this very incident. The discussion focused on weather it would be wise to help in this situation. Think of the repercussions. A Good Samaritan steps in to help the man and is A: either jumped by the kids recording B: jumped by other blacks or C: strike a black child and have a hate crime added to the assault that the Affirmative Action D.C. police will charge you with. Seems like a no win situation but is becoming more and more frequent. </p>

		<p> If he had fought back; the consequences would be:beaten by other blacks, arrested by the authorities and when in jail if blacks found out; more beatings and possibly death by blacks.<br>
 The police, politicians, bureaucrats and society in general are all against white men.The main stream media, feminist, politicians, police departments and many other American outlets  have villified, denigrated, run down and ridiculed white men to a point where we&rsquo;ve become fair game for any thing that anyone wants to do.<br>
 For most white men today; it began when we were just little boys. Stand on your own two feet, never ask for help from anyone, mind your own business and don&rsquo;t stick your nose into anyone elses. What this has accomplished is that white men are seperated from each other, will not help each other, there is no sense of camradire, cohesiveness or any kind of white male bonding allowed by American society. These situations never occur in the black community, they know there is strength in numbers, solidarity and helping each other is normal.</p>

		<p>This is like one of those spouse abuse cases against a husband. The husband has learned he&rsquo;s &#8216;not supposed to hit a woman&rsquo;, or he&rsquo;s afraid of the consequences of doing so. In this case the citizen has learned he&rsquo;s not supposed to hit a person of color, because that would be racism. The husband can endure the abuse or in many cases he&rsquo;d have a good chance of being able to run and get away. .  for whatever reason. . the authorities don&rsquo;t take it as seriously (unless a weapon of some kind is used).</p>

		<p>I found it interesting that this story should be reported today.  I live in Las Vegas and just yesterday I was going to stop for gas, the gas station includes a fast food restaurant. The station is across the street from a high school. The parking lot and store front were over run by dozens of teenagers they just milled around blocking the doors and the parking spots. Not wanting to get annoyed I drove on to another station. When I passed by on the way home three cop cars were parked in the  lot, the cops watching the kids.</p>
<p>Is this what our society has turned into?  Teens intimidating people scaring them away from entering stores and places of business. We now need a police presence just so we may shop.<br>

		<p>Senators Mark Warner and Jim Webb voted for a hate crimes bill that did not protect Whites.  Their cowardice and anti-White act is in this attack.</p>
<p>Eric Holder and Barack Obama pushed this hate crimes bill and Holder testified that Whites were excluded from protection.</p>
<p>Patrick Cleburne at Vdare had a long series on the hate crime bill in 2010.  One of them is here:</p>

What&rsquo;s wrong with this loser. He&rsquo;s a disgrace not only to the white race but to men in general. Maybe he didn&rsquo;t want to hurt her feelings because she is black. It&rsquo;s sad on so many levels.</p>

		<p>It was thousands of attacks like this that led to the ethnic cleansing of whites from our urban areas. To add the grossest of insults to the injury, the victims were called the victimizers. This is the bizarre history that will be written of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p>
<p>One may argue, &#8220;Well, it was just a few wrongdoers who caused the trouble,&#8221; but then what do we make of the dozens of observers who watched and did nothing, and even taunted the victim later?</p>
<p>The video was obviously originally uploaded to worldstarhiphop.com. The URL tells you what the site is all about and a quick visit only confirms it. In the age of Obama, will videos like this become more and more common?</p>
<p>And can anybody make out through the ebonics what the videographers were saying? Although they were practically talking right into the microphone, I could scarcely even pick out a word here and there.</p>

		<p>The sign should have mentioned the race of the hoodlums. But I guess the passengers figured it out if they thought on it. I wonder what Haywood&rsquo;s views on race were before and after the attack.</p>

		<p>For those readers not familiar with the DC Metro, L&rsquo;Enfant Plaza is in the tourist and federal government area of DC.  It is NOT in a bad neighborhood or a black neighborhood (synonymous, of course).  I&rsquo;ve always considered it a &#8220;safe station&#8221;.  Well, until I read this&hellip;</p>
<p>If you can be viciously attacked with impunity at that stop at 7:15pm, then nowhere in the metro system is safe from black wilding.  And you can&rsquo;t carry a weapon legally in DC, either; only on the Virginia side could you get a concealed carry permit.  </p>
<p>DC and the Metro administration will make every effort to cover this up.  They deny every metro attack by black thugs until video shows up, and then they try the &#8220;isolated incident&#8221; routine.  They even sometimes imply the victim had randomly been racist to the &#8220;youths&#8221; and provoked the whole incident.  </p>
<p>Black teens in DC are completely out of control, and getting worse every year.  <br>

<p>NO, there was a reason. Just plain enjoyment from tormenting a whitey. A perverse and sick mentality on display. This stuff goes on all the time and NOTHING is ever done, or very little. The guy is lucky, next time he may be slashed to pieces with box cutters.</p>

		<p>Most of the discussion I&rsquo;ve seen about this attack seems to center around a few questions: Should the guy have fought back against teen girls? What&rsquo;s the matter with this guy that he didn&rsquo;t fight back against teen girls who were physically assaulting him? And eventually everyone sounds off on what they would have done if it was them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all well and good, these are natural, normal questions to ask.</p>
<p>On a slightly different note, here&rsquo;s what I have to add to the discussion: This video is very sad to me. I don&rsquo;t care about the irony of a physically stronger person being assaulted by physically weaker ones. Doesn&rsquo;t matter to me.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sad is that this is video of a hate crime, plain and simple. If such a crime exists, then this is a video of a hate crime plain as day. This person was targeted for being white. And the intention was to terrorize and intimidate whites.</p>
<p>And it will go unreported as a hate crime, much less will there be any prosecution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very sad to see a fellow white person have to go through this.</p>

It is NOT in a bad neighborhood or a black neighborhood (synonymous, of course). I&rsquo;ve always considered it a &ldquo;safe station&rdquo;.   &mdash;  Posted @ 11:17 pm, Jan 7</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mean to start an argument, but I used to live in the 20024 zip code where the station is located, and while the area is maybe not as bad as it used to be, it&rsquo;s still nearly 3/4 black in population, with home values well below the DC average.  According to crime statistics, you are 1 1/2 times more likely to be raped and more than 6 times more likely to be murdered in the area than the national average.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/246cdtt" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/246cdtt</a> Just Google &#8220;20024 demographics&#8221; and &#8220;20024 crime statistics.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can personally vouch for the fact that I NEVER felt safe walking to and from the L&rsquo;Enfant Plaza station, or in it, since I used it practically every day I lived there and had to be constantly on the lookout for marauding blacks.  I&rsquo;m glad I no longer live there, and I wish my fellow whites that live there now the best.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Stop it! Stop it! &hellip; I did nothing to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s &#8220;thinking white&#8221; at its best. </p>
<p>This crass Eurocentrist first gives orders to the proud autonomous Africans  &mdash;  &#8220;stop,&#8221; how insulting! Then, to make things worse, he imposes Eurocentric paradigms of &#8220;justice&#8221; and &#8220;fairness&#8221; on them. In his little world people don&rsquo;t expect beatings unless they&rsquo;ve attacked another.</p>
<p>But he did not &#8220;do nothing&#8221;; he dared to let them see his white skin, on their turf. There is no greater provocation.</p>
<p>By pedantically reminding them that he had &#8220;done nothing,&#8221; he implies a deficiency in their ability to reason. Imagine the effrontery of questioning a wise African&rsquo;s judgment. Unconscious, institutional racism seldom presents itself more shamelessly.</p>
<p>The children were simply behaving like healthy little Africans. Attacking whitey is what they do. What does this vicious racist expect? Does he also go out in the rain without an umbrella and expect not to get wet?</p>
<p>  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the next Dershowitz comes along and plies such sophistry on a black jury, crucifies the victim, and gets an award from the bar association.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Eric Holder and Barack Obama pushed this hate crimes bill and Holder testified that Whites were excluded from protection.&#8221;   &mdash;   Old Atlantic<br>
__   __   __   __   __  </p>
<p>How can any group - particularly a racial group   &mdash;    be excluded from protection of the law?  I just don&rsquo;t &#8220;get&#8221; it!  I would think this is utterly unconstitutional. Illegal!  Insane!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not arguing with you, just wondering. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the direction in which this country is moving.  With people like Holder and  Obama (and their advisors and  backers) now running things, right from the very top levels, I can&rsquo;t say &#8220;our&#8221; country any longer. It would be foolish for us to continue to think of this as &#8220;our&#8221; country when the government is now so plainly against us.</p>
<p>Basically, we  whites are on our own. It&rsquo;s really been a long time developing   &mdash;   at least since the &rsquo;60s (or even the &rsquo;50s, with school deseg.)   &mdash;    but now it&rsquo;s coming out in the open. No one will help you, White Man!  And don&rsquo;t you dare even try to defend yourself.</p>
<p>If you defend yourself against a wilding mob of &#8220;children&#8221;, you&rsquo;re a &#8220;racist&#8221;. And if you try to  get organized, you&rsquo;re a &#8220;nazi&#8221;.  There&rsquo;s no winning, because the game is rigged against you.  It&rsquo;s all been designed this way, and as I said, it has deep roots and goes way back.  It&rsquo;s no accident.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know abut that.  Yes, it&rsquo;s pathetic, but you have to consider the legal aspects and the ramifications. </p>
<p>What if he had smacked her? What if he injured her?   An adult has to be very careful about hitting a twelve-year-old child   &mdash;     particularly a black child!</p>
<p>The &#8220;black community&#8221; and the media would be enraged. Sharpton would be there in a New York minute.  And the mob (of her friends) would all testify against him that HE attacked HER. That goes without saying. </p>
<p>And if he goes to jail, god help him there!</p>
<p>He was probably wise not to hit her/them back. It&rsquo;s really a dilemma. And one grown man against a whole  mob of &#8220;kids&#8221; is not a favorable situation in any case.</p>
<p>(And if he were &#8220;carrying&#8221;, might I add, if would be all the worse!)</p>

		<p>When you are in an area with a large population, you should carry pepper foam, pepper spray, or mace, and a concealed hand gun if possible. Don&rsquo;t let blacks get close to you. It is particularly important not to let them get behind you. <br>
 <br>
Once I read a letter to the editor by a young black man who said it hurt his feelings to detect fear in white people because of his presence. I felt sympathy for him. Nevertheless, I would rather hurt the feelings of a decent black person than risk being robbed, beaten up, or perhaps killed. Too many of them are dangerous to take any chances.</p>

<p>That reminds me so strongly of the recent thread about the Belgian couple traveling in the Congo.  When their vehicle was stuck in the mud, the locals would gather around and laugh, jeer,  taunt them, and demand money.</p>
<p>When the whites naively  asked them,  &#8220;Why should we give you money?&#8221;<br>
&hellip;.the very simple, straightforward answer was:  <b>&#8220;Because you are white!&#8221;</b></p>
<p>I think that says it all about their mentality. You owe them because you are white. It is their entitlement. It is your destiny to pay.</p>

<p>Did you notice all the black teens taking pictures?  He would have maced one of the little &#8220;darlings&#8221; and you&rsquo;d better believe they would have all gone down to the local police station with them.  Blacks hate the police, but they LOVE using them against Whitey!  That poor guy was in a no-win situation.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t.  For starters, he&rsquo;s one of &#8220;them&#8221;.  Even if he doesn&rsquo;t act like them, he aids and abets them.  Tell me something: if that White guy lashed out in self-defense at those two black thuglings and was arrested (very likely) and your &#8216;decent&rsquo; black man was sitting on his jury, how do you think he&rsquo;d vote?  Hmm?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fool yourselves, people.  He didn&rsquo;t defend himself because he, like every other White in this country, regardless of political persuasion, knows what would have happened to him if he did.  It&rsquo;s not fear of blacks that&rsquo;s holding our people down, it&rsquo;s fear of the omnisprescent government that&rsquo;s working against us.</p>

		<p>Come on Anonymous 23,<br>
Are you implying that he chose not to defend himself because of fear of the goverment? Why he didn&rsquo;t run away? The guy was scared and intimidated.It was beyond his conscious control. Blacks have such effect on most whites.</p>

		<p>&#8220;A Good Samaritan steps in to help the man and is A: either jumped by the kids recording B: jumped by other blacks or C: strike a black child and have a hate crime added to the assault that the Affirmative Action D.C. police will charge you with. Seems like a no win situation but is becoming more and more frequent.&#8221; Tyson</p>
<p>  That pretty much covers all the DC options Tyson. When animals are attacked it&rsquo;s either submit, attack or flee.  If I&rsquo;d had mace<br>
or pepper spray in that situation, I believe I would have used it on the young hoodlums. Girls who act like thugs should not be treated as delicate ladies. </p>

		<p>This is just sad.  I have been seeing these kinds of videos pop up more often as of late.  It is quite unfortunate that these jigs can get away with such actions.  If this were a group of white kids attacking a black man I&rsquo;m sure this would be the main topic of all the New Networks.  </p>
<p>Now I am not racist, but I believe there are 2 kinds of blacks.  There are the jigs who have no self respect, as well as respect for others outside their friends and family.  Then there are the African Americans.  They are respectful, and have managed to live life in a straight line.  </p>
<p>James Joyce once said &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.&#8221;  Ignorant people are products of their environment, and that&rsquo;s why we have ghettos.  The United States has it&rsquo;s own form of population control, but it is unfortunate that innocent people get caught in the mix.</p>

There&rsquo;s a nice hotel built over the L&rsquo;Enfant metro stop,making it a very convenient place to stay if you&rsquo;re visiting DC.  The hotel has an excellent weight room,something that even many five star hotels lack nowadays.  If you want you&rsquo;re strong you there&rsquo;s a proper benchset at the hotel that will allow you bench four plates on each side.  The breakfast buffet is also quite good.  I&rsquo;m surprised that the incident occured at this particular metrostop it&rsquo;s usually filled with cops.   </p>
