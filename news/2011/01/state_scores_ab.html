<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s fourth- and eighth-grade students overall scored above average on a national science assessment in 2009, but results released Tuesday continue to show worrisome trends for African-Americans.</p>
<p>For black students in both grades, performance on the national science test was below average, and the achievement gap in eighth-grade science between Wisconsin&rsquo;s black and white students was the highest in the nation, according to the latest results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s snapshot of results from the younger grades revealed:</p>
<p>* {snip}</p>
<p>* In fourth grade, black students in Wisconsin had an average score that was 43 points lower than white students in the state. By eighth grade, that performance gap widened to a 44-point difference.</p>
<p>* Hispanic fourth-graders in Wisconsin scored 26 points lower than their white peers in the state, better than the national average of a 32-point difference. But, by eighth grade, the performance gap of 30 points between the state&rsquo;s white and Hispanic students was about the same as the national average.</p>

		<p>My understanding is that the blacks in WI are largely people who moved from Chicago to take advantage of more generous welfare.  So they are probably lower in quality than blacks nationally.  </p>

		<p>Years ago, sissy-boy William Buckley remarked that the closer to the Canadian border one got, the higher the test scores were.  Of course, that was a cowardly way of saying the truth.  The truth is that the blacker the population, the lower the test scores get.  Geographical proximity is obviously incidental in this matter.</p>

		<p>The reason is that there are more Nordic, blue eye, blond haired people in Wisconsin who have superior DNA.  The blacks have been eating lead paint chips all there lives and they have bad DNA.  Keep looking and you will find the master race in Wisconsin.</p>

		<p>Makes sense because virtually all Wisconsin blacks are migrants from the Chicago ghettoes who came when they discovered that Wisconsin welfare benefits were better than those of Illinois.</p>

		<p>Down here in Dixieland, we applaud Wisconsin&rsquo;s commitment to make all feel welcome as they embrace diversity (Diversity Curse, we know!) and help minorities.   </p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for all those Wisconsin yankee soldiers who came down here to kill our men, rape our women, burn our farms, and free our slaves, Wisconsin today wouldn&rsquo;t be benefiting from such enriching and culturally vibrant &#8220;communities of color&#8221;.</p>
<p>Too bad about those test scores, though.  Now, you will watch more and more resources stolen from White taxpaying humanity to make more black teachers rich trying to close the achievement gap.</p>
<p>And we do appreciate that all those blacks feel welcome up there.  They&rsquo;d be pulling our test scores and society down into the dirt if they were here.  We are low enough, already.</p>

		<p>If Wisconsin has the biggest gap between black and white students that just means the cheeseheads have the most honest scoring.</p>
<p>You can bet the states with the narrowest achievement gaps have the most test fraud. </p>

		<p>These results highlight how blacks handicap white students. Wis. is almost 90% and only 5% black, and so whites are not as distracted by black &#8220;issues&#8221;. If you research a little, I&rsquo;m sure you will find wis. white students do better than whites in states with high black populations while blacks score the same, and Asians, who have limited contact with blacks(limited to being robbed/beaten)score the same across the country. </p>

		<p>During the &#8216;80&rsquo;s, and continuing on, there was a steady migration of black welfare recipients from Chicago to Wisconsin. The welfare was more generous and the subsidized housing easier to get. Since I worked in a related field at the time I could observe that the migrants were of the career welfare sort, the type who never intended to get off the rolls. When they would leave one state for another they would just sign up there, but with no intention, of course, to look for work, that wasn&rsquo;t part of the plan. There may have been some federal involvement behind the scenes as it seemed too easy to me at the time, almost as if they were being invited by being shown the great apartments they could get there for free. The children in the story are probably mostly second or third generation of the migrants. </p>

<p>In recent years I have been wonderstruck at hearing about populations of blacks suddenly popping up in far flung northern places like Oregon, Wisconsin and even Idaho.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they are refugees constantly on the lookout for freebies.  Then they enter a place, despoil it, the whites flee, then the more ambitious blacks move on, leaving a crack infested ghetto in their wake.</p>

		<p><i>The achievement gap in eighth-grade science between Wisconsin&rsquo;s black and white students was the highest in the nation.</i></p>
<p>And, it will continue to widen.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another little tidbit from the Milwaukee <i>Urinal:</i></p>
<p><i>There are more than 12,000 African immigrants living in Milwaukee</i></p>
<p>Wonder how Coach Lombardi would feel about this:</p>
<p><i>Schools in Green Bay are coping with an increasing influx of Somali refugees</i></p>
<p>And elsewhere in White (gasp!) Wisconsin:</p>
<p><i>In less than a decade, a river of refugees from Somalia has flowed into Barron Today, 12% of Barron&rsquo;s population is from Somalia.</i></p>
<p>Repeat until the refugee industry is <b>criminalized</b>, as it should be, or until Wisconsin&rsquo;s White population is diluted enough.</p>
<p>Fertility rate of Somalis:  5.0</p>
<p>As African refugees, with an average IQ of only 67, continue to pour into the US, the black-white gap will increase as these Africans will be counted as part of the black population.</p>

		<p>The disparity in intelligence of the races is one of the biggest problems whites face. As creators of the modern world we face jealousy, hate and the cruel desire of the colored people to bring us down. In totality, the white race stands head and shoulders above the other races. As one acquaintance put it, there are white people out there with minds the size of planets. You do not get that type of brainpower with endless hours of study. You are born with it. Unfortunately, the only thing colored people will do will be to deprive us of the type world we are capable of creating for ourselves. </p>

		<p>There it is, that pesky achievement gap. </p>

<p>Gee, that sounds familiar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a trend - it&rsquo;s a fact. That&rsquo;s like saying, &#8220;Reading scores for Alaskan seals are in once again but the results continue to show worrisome trends in comprehension for the seals.&#8221;<br>

		<p>As a liscensed teacher in Wisconsin, and lifetime resisdent, its been my experience that a great deal of WI teachers were born, raised, educated, and remained in state to teach.  I can honestly say that the high scores come from, at least partially, generations of morals, values, pride, and a strong work ethic.  I know many of AR readers will see WI as a true blue liberal state.  I beg to differ.  A great deal of WI is still very rural and conservative adhereing to the traits I&rsquo;ve mentioned above.  These traits lead to the higher test scores.  Whacko liberal Madison and ghetto Milwaukee are what makes the state appear &#8220;blue.&#8221;  Those items also effect test scores.  I&rsquo;m very proud of my WI culture and heritage.  If you ever see my state painted blue, please note that there is NOTHING in my heritage that makes it so.  Achievement gap?  Same old excuses.  Nobody will dare to point out the real reasons. </p>

		<p>Well, this has to be the result of the White man&rsquo;s raycizm and the legacy of slavery. What the hell else could it be?<br>
  Anyway, I&rsquo;m not worried about it &#8216;cos I heard the President&rsquo;s speech last night, and he says we&rsquo;re gonna have investments in maf and syence. He says we had a sputnik moment wake-up call and now we&rsquo;re gonna have innovation&hellip;..where can I gets me some innovation?<br>
  I also know the entertainer and physical menace, Mary Bligh, has started a big project to get Black girls interested in maf n&rsquo; syence.<br>
  No, I have full confidence that these Wisconsin failures will go on to great innovations; surely after the raycizm is destroyed they will be equipped to be the new technocratic, managerial, and entrepreneurial elite of the USA! Uhuru! All power to the people!</p>

<p>I live in the Phoenix metro area, and there&rsquo;s been a huge influx here of late. Just a year or two ago, you hardly ever saw them, but now, they&rsquo;re everywhere. It&rsquo;s astonishing how many of them came here so fast. According to the most recent census data, my census tract is 0% black, but you wouldn&rsquo;t know it by taking a stroll around my neighborhood. </p>

		<p>Bah, blacks in Wisconsin?  When are we going to form our own whites-only community for &#8220;racists&#8221; and race realists only?
