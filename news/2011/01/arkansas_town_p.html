<h1>Arkansas Town Prohibits Confederate Flag</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KLRT-TV (Little Rock), January 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After the mayor of a small Arkansas town flew the confederate flag in observance of Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s birthday, the city council passed an ordinance Monday saying only the US flag and Arkansas flag can be flown on city property.</p>
<p>Mayor Jim Smithson flew the flag above Marshal City Hall from the 14th to the 18th of January. It resulted in numerous phone calls, e-mails, and an emergency meeting to make sure it does not happen again.</p>
<p>City council member Dolphus Milam voted for the ordinance. &#8220;If they want to fly the confederate flag, let them fly it at home, why put it on City Hall?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayor Jim Smithson says he doesn&rsquo;t regret his decision to fly the confederate flag but he does regret the fallout. &#8220;Out of what I consider disrespect for Robert E Lee&rsquo;s birthday and the hero that he was to a lot of people just like Martin Luther King, Jr. is to a lot of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p><br>
Daniel and Mayor Smithson say flying the confederate flag is not a racial issue but standing up for southern heritage, the military, and state&rsquo;s rights. </p>
<p>While the majority of the city council feels this ordinance was the appropriate response to the controversy last week, many people agree with the mayor. The mayor says people in town have come up to him asking to shake his hand saying they&rsquo;re proud of his actions and respect him for flying the confederate flag.</p>
<p>One resident attending the meeting, Larry Cotton, was critical of the decision. &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to be very frank, you&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;re going to offend the blacks, that&rsquo;s what it amounts to.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Mayor Smithson should have flown the Lee Headquarters flag, which is a variation of the Confederate First National. It is extremely likely that the city council would have been too historically ignorant to figure out what it was, and too arrogant to ask.</p>

		<p>The confederate flag is now being equated with the nazi flag.  Fly it at your peril. </p>
<p>Most of my ancestors were on the union side, one branch was confederate.  I consider it a historical flag.  Not really needed flying on gov&rsquo;t buildings.  We don&rsquo;t fly the Betsey Ross flag on the capital.</p>

		<p>The simple fact of the matter is that there was no objective moral right on the side of the North.  The was over states rights versus federal control.  Probably not one in fifty rebs who fought in the Civil War owned slaves, and Lincoln&rsquo;s Emancipation Proclamation &#8220;freed&#8221; only those living in the Confederate states - slaves held in the North received no such dispensation.  And yes, there was slavery in the North, though it admittedly wasn&rsquo;t widespread enough to make the slaves a major factor in the Northern economy.</p>
<p>Lincoln, I&rsquo;ve long believed, just didn&rsquo;t want to be president of half the country, and was willing to kill over six hundred thousand American citizens, North and South, to prevent the South from leaving.</p>
<p>There is no prohibition of secession in the constitution - the issue isn&rsquo;t even addressed.  A number of states, among them New York, North Carolina, joined the union with the proviso that they could leave if the arrangement displeased them.</p>

<p>Respectfully I have to disagree with these statements. It&rsquo;s exactly that way of thinking that has gotten us into a lot of the problems we see today. Everybody seems to keep with this idea if we continue to give just one more inch here, or a concession there for a certain group&rsquo;s feelings that everyone will just get along. That&rsquo;s it not case and it hasn&rsquo;t been the case since the beginning. The more whites allow, the worse it will get.</p>

		<p>In response to john&rsquo;s post #11:</p>
<p>Gen. R.E. Lee&rsquo;s home state of Virginia ratified the Constitution with just such a provision; that it retained the right to withdraw from the Union at its discretion.  </p>
<p>And after Lincoln announced that the Federal government would use force to prevent the states of the Deep South from exercising self-determination, Virginia&rsquo;s citizens overwhelmingly approved a referendum for secession; fully aware that their state might become a bloody battleground.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand the motivations of the individual Yankee soldiers.  Their hostile invasion of the South must have been thought by them to be big &#8220;sport.&#8221;  It certainly couldn&rsquo;t be said to have been made in the spirit of liberty  &mdash;  as in the American Revolution  &mdash;  or out of any love for enslaved Africans.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite surprised the city council of a small, 98%-white, Southern town voted for an ordinance specifically to prevent a Confederate flag from flying.  I honestly thought Southerners had more sense than that.  Was I wrong?  Hopefully the town will redeem itself by voting those bastards out at the next election.</p>
<p>As a Yankee, born in New Jersey, I must say I don&rsquo;t care for the Confederate flag myself - It would never fly outside my home.  But I also know that it is an important symbol of Southern heritage, and I believe all Southerners should have the right to fly it in their own states.  </p>
<p>EDIT:  The town is 98.32% white (a small number of these are Hispanic), and nearly all the town&rsquo;s minorities are Indians (who are 1.3% of the population).  Blacks make up just 0.08% of Marshall, Arkansas&rsquo; residents.  They are more Hispanics than blacks, more mixed-race persons than blacks, and more people from &#8220;other races&#8221; (mostly Hispanics) than there are blacks.  So, I don&rsquo;t see who in that town the Confederate flag could possibly offend.  With a total population of 1,313, that means there is one single black resident in the town.  I don&rsquo;t think the flag needs to be taken down for one man (or woman).</p>

<p>So much revisionism here..where to begin?</p>
<p>&#8220;The [war] was about states rights versus federal control&#8221;..</p>
<p>Not true. The south seceded because of slavery. It is no accident that South Carolina was the first state to secede as it had the highest percentage of slaves of any state. At the South Carolinan delegates convention of Dec 24 1860 to explain the &#8220;cause which induce and justify our secession from the union&#8221; it stated &#8220;the ever-increasing hostility of the non-slaveholding states to the institution of slavery&#8221; and &#8220;the failure of northern states to fulfill their constitutional obligations by interfering with the return of escaped slaves to bondage&#8221;. The war was about slavery and the southern plantocracy&rsquo;s desire to preserve it.</p>
<p>&#8220;probably not one Reb in fifty who fought in the civil war owned slaves&#8221;</p>
<p> The true figure is very much higher. There were four million slaves in the Confederacy in 1861. SOMEBODY sure owned them. And wanted to continue owning them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lincoln&rsquo;s emancipation program freed only those slaves in the Confederacy - not in the north&#8221;</p>
<p>This was temporary political and military expediency. He didn&rsquo;t want to risk losing the border states, which were divided in their loyalties. He did what he could as best he could. By the way if the south really didn&rsquo;t care about slavery, WHY DIDN&rsquo;T IT JUST ISSUE ITS OWN EMANCIPATION DECLARATION? This would have removed a very powerful propaganda tool from Washington&rsquo;s hands and might very well have succeeded in giving the Confederacy the all important foreign recognition from European countries that it so badly needed. </p>
<p>&#8220;there was slavery in the north&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong. Unless you mean the border states??</p>
<p>&#8220;killed 600,000 Americans to keep the south from leaving&#8221;.</p>
<p>But 9,000,000 people wouldn&rsquo;t have been Americans anymore had the south left. And what then? When and how would the south have ended slavery? And you would today be dealing with ALL their descendents, rather then the current number of about half. There would have been no &#8220;great migration&#8221; since the north would now have been a separate country. The borders of the Confederacy would have been crossed by linguistic and social and some cultural ties. They would also not have been based on any natural boundaries. If the south had at least absorbed Kentucky they would have at least had the Ohio river as a boundary but the Tennessee line was entirerly artificial. The ten and a half states that comprised the Confederacy made no sense geographically, demographically or economically. The truth is the south compromised itself AND EVERYONE ELSE with its practice of slavery.  </p>

		<p>To Anonymous post #20:</p>
<p>More correctly, the war was fought over the rights of the states to pursue self-determination outside of the Union.  In this case, the sticking points were the extension of slavery into the new territories and the maintaining of an equitable balance in Congress between the sections, North and South.</p>
<p>Most authorities estimate that 5 to 10% of Confederate soldiers owned slaves.  My immediate ancestors owned none, but they fought in solidarity with slave owners against hosts of unwelcome Northern invaders whose intentions were less than honorable.</p>
<p>The Confederacy probably couldn&rsquo;t have maintained favorable international relations for more than a very few decades without ending its practice of slavery.  By then, however, technology might well have developed practical agricultural machinery to render slavery obsolete anyway.  And in the meantime, the South would likely have figured out a humane way of disposing with the emancipated slaves short of sharing citizenship on the basis of equality.  Not only Southerners, but even Northern abolitionists and Presidents Lincoln and Grant envisioned a mass relocation of the blacks to Central America or Africa.         </p>
<p>Anonymous post #21:</p>
<p>The video accompanying the original article shows the popular red battle flag with the blue &#8220;X&#8221; and 13 white stars on the &#8220;X.&#8221;  </p>
<p>One would think the Confederate national flag (with 3 stripes) would be more offensive (though less recognizable).  It is THAT flag which originally represented the &#8220;treasonous&#8221; Confederacy as a sovereign nation, separate and apart from the Northern states and the Federal government.  </p>

<p>Not true. The south seceded because of slavery.</p>
<p>That was only one of many issues regarding the secession of the Southern States, but the simple matter is that slavery would have died very quickly in the south anyway, as newly invented cotton harvesting machinery made it economically unfeasible. </p>
<p>Slavery has never been economically tenable except in (historically) short periods and under certain (again short lived) circumstances, it takes too many supervisors and too much loss in quality control. Besides, as your Northern Factory owners learned, it is much easier to hire someone at slave wages and chain them to a machine for 12 hours a day than it is to provide their housing, food, medical care, clothing etc. etc. ad nauseum as any slave owner would have to do.</p>
<p>As to slave owners; less than 5% of the entire population owned even so many as One slave -and they would have been the officer class anyway. A slave was a considerable investment, far more expensive than a horse or other livestock -just to own, that discounts the high maintenance cost of keeping another adult human healthy, fed and housed -so it can work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lincoln&rsquo;s emancipation program freed only those slaves in the Confederacy - not in the north&rdquo;<br>
This was temporary political and military expediency.</p>
<p>So was firing on Fort Sumpter. </p>
<p>What about Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s suspension of habeus corpus, or introducing the draft, or any of the other &#8220;politically expedient&#8221; tyrannies imposed by that fraud? His ego simply could not accept the loss of half of the nation. </p>
<p>As stated, slavery was a dying institution that would have withered simply due to economic forces -and who knows, it seems highly likely that the South would have eventually reversed the slave trade and sold their stock back to the Africans who sold the slaves to white men in the first place. We cannot say what would have happened -the border to Canada is not sealed and guarded as you imply the Iron Curtian of the Mason-Dixon would have been. Also, as you implied, the Confederacy was facing considerable international pressure to end the institution -and they would have -on their own- without some hypocrite Yankee factory owner (who saw nothing wrong with keeping women and children shackeled to dangerous machinery or pulling mining carts for pennies a day) forcing them to do so.</p>
<p>But 9,000,000 people wouldn&rsquo;t have been Americans anymore had the south left.</p>
<p>Americans of the Confederate States Of America were still Americans, still celebrated the Fourth of July -the First American Revolution- and saw no desire to see that revolt against one tyrant 3,000 miles away -tarnished by 3,000 tyrants in that swamp on the Potomac. </p>
<p><br>
Had the Second American Revolution been a success, perhaps today, you would not have an overbearing Fed Beast cramming it&rsquo;s agenda down your throat -I KNOW that I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It was about State&rsquo;s Rights vs. the Federal Government, the slave issue was merely the match that struck the tinder. </p>
<p>And the tinder is still there -perhaps more so today than ever.</p>

		<p>Another force that would have eventually made slavery uneconomical was Irish immigration. After all, as True Blue mentioned, who needs slaves when you have starving Irish who you could pay a dollar a day if you were feeling generous&hellip;and  could pay the women and children even less? In fact, plantation owners used Irish immigrants to do jobs deemed too dangerous for slaves, like clearing snake and alligator-infested swamps. One of my mother-in-law&rsquo;s Irish ancestors who came over in 1849 went missing when digging a canal somewhere in a swamp where he either stepped into quicksand or got bitten by a snake.</p>

<p>The typical southern defensiveness&hellip;<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Only a handful of Whites owned slaves. Most southerners did not&#8221;. [And of course, MY ancestors didn&rsquo;t own them.]</p>
<p>Slavery was widespread throughout the south and was its defining characteristic. In South Carolina 48.7 of white families owned slaves. In Mississippi 48%, Florida 36%, Alabama 35.1%, Georgia 38%, Louisiana 32.2% and Texas 28.5%. These deep south states were the cultural core of the Confederacy and slavery was as much a reality of life as breathing air. Slavery was growing particularly rapidly in east Texas, after the Free Soil party was thwarted in its efforts to secure its admission to the union as a free state. To say that the south seceded because of state rights is ludicrous. It seceded to protect the lucrative institution of slavery. Even those whites in the south who didn&rsquo;t own slaves had no interest in seeing the black populace in their midst set free. </p>
<p>&#8220;The south would have eventually freed them. Slavery was dying out. They would have been &#8220;humanely&#8221; disposed of&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>No southern state ever took any effort to end slavery. No southern state ever tried to convert it to serfdom. There was no abolitionist movement in the south. The south expanded slavery everywhere it could. It scuttled the Free Soil party. It tried to expand slavery into Kansas with violence. Slavery was growing rapidly in Texas before the war. Some southerners talked of absorbing Mexico and Cuba to &#8220;strengthen&#8221; slavery. The historical truth is that the south never made any effort at all to end slavery. It was very lucrative. </p>
<p>&#8220;Evil Yankee factory owners were as bad as the slaveowners.&#8221;</p>
<p>My point is not so much to compare morality but to look at the LONG-TERM IMPACT of the matter. In the south slavery was based along racial lines and ensured an permanent racial division. This just wasn&rsquo;t so in the north. </p>

<p>The typical Northern aggression&hellip;</p>
<p>MY ancestors DIDN&rsquo;T own slaves.  I&rsquo;ve pored through the 1850 and 1860 censuses and found one great uncle who rented one temporarily, probably to help with a tobacco crop.  My family were farmers, not planters.  Planters were but a small fraction of the population; sorta like millionaires today. </p>
<p>&#8220;Even those whites in the South who didn&rsquo;t own slaves had no intereset in seeing the black populace in their midst set free.&#8221;  </p>
<p>You are CORRECT sir!  And as soon as Honest Abe delivered the Emancipation Proclamation, Northern states hastened to pass anti-immigration laws to keep the freed slaves from entering their borders. Considering the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of diversity, can you blame them?</p>
<p>&#8220;No southern state ever took any effort to end slavery.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Wrong.  Sometime after the Revolution but before the invention of the cotton gin, Virginia&rsquo;s legislature came within 1 vote of abolishing slavery.  And then there was the American Colonization Society made up of Northerners AND Southerners.  Their hope was to end slavery here and send the blacks back to Africa where they had purchased a large tract called Liberia where the ex-slaves could be &#8220;humanely disposed of,&#8221; become landowners, and govern themselves.  President Monroe, of Virginia, was a prominent sponsor.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the south slavery was based along racial lines and ensured a permanent racial division.  THIS JUST WASN&rsquo;T SO IN THE NORTH.&#8221;   </p>
<p>Huh?  In the colonial era, slavery existed in every one of the 13 colonies.  More recently, even Massachusetts Yankees were irate about federally enforced school busing to accomplish racial integration.</p>
<p>Deo vindice.        </p>

		<p>I have never owned a slave or imprisoned nobody. I do not think anyone today has ever been a slave. Why am I still paying the price for something I had no part of? Why are the blacks today still getting preferencial treatment over Whites when they have never been a slave? affirmative action is nothing more than a two dollar word for &#8220;discrimination&#8221; against Whites. as a country we know this and yet we allow it to continue.We as a nation have failed miserably.We have allowed other races take away the country that our forefathers fought and died for. How proud they would be!</p>

<p>I have to wonder why this subject stirs you to such anger and malevolence towards Southerners.  I curse the day any slave was brought into my country, but they did arrive here via Southern and NORTHERN ports.  I think this point was made several weeks ago in another post.</p>
<p>Also, my family DID own several slaves.  By today&rsquo;s standards they were lower to middle class, virtual sharecroppers themselves.  Why?  Because the South was agrarian not industrialized as the North whom you INCORRECTLY claim did NOT practice slavery.   Am I to be held personally responsible 150 years later for their choices?  Before you answer in the affirmative, be careful - you may end up sounding like the perpetually whining reparation seeking blacks who couldn&rsquo;t take care of themselves then and still refuse to now.  One hundred and fifty years passes and all whites are still to blame for their troubles.  </p>
<p>&#8220;My point is not so much to compare morality but to look at the LONG-TERM IMPACT of the matter. In the south slavery was based along racial lines and ensured an permanent racial division. This just wasn&rsquo;t so in the north. &#8220;</p>
<p>What wasn&rsquo;t so?  Are you denying slavery ever existed in the Northern states or that it existed but was not based &#8220;along racial lines&#8221;?  Perhaps you are eluding to the industrial age and northern factories which for all practical purposes &#8220;enslaved&#8221; poor white European immigrants and which gave rise to child labor laws?  News flash- no one&rsquo;s hands were clean.  Unfortunately, ALL of our forefathers made mistakes.  Instead of hating your white brothers, agree to disagree and move on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, no matter what area or country blacks inhabit, as far as blacks are concerned WHITE SKIN= GUILTY RACIST, BLACK SKIN= DOWNTRODDEN VICTIM.</p>
<p><br>
As far as the news article goes, the mayor should&rsquo;ve known better to fly the Confederate Battle Flag over a public building.  IMHO, he should be free to fly it at his home or a private residence, but he inflamed the community with choice to fly it above city hall.  And before I get &#8220;flamed&#8221; by my fellow Amreners- there are many variations of the Confederate flag which he could&rsquo;ve flown and not caused such an uproar.  I don&rsquo;t want to see Mexican flags or Afrikan flags over public buildings either.</p>

<p>I blame the south for creating the problem in the first place.</p>
<p>Also the HISTORICAL FACT is that Virginia did NOT end slavery. It actually had the largest slave population of any state in 1861 (490,865).</p>
<p>It is true there was slavery in the north DURING THE COLONIAL ERA. But it was very modest compared to the south, was ended between 1777 and 1804, and above all the north never EXPANDED SLAVERY. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have anger or malevolence towards southerners. I simply am saying what I believe is the truth. Slavery was essentially created, perpetuated and extended in this country by the south. The consequences of this today is a large and hostile black community. </p>
<p>Nor did I ever say there was no slavery in the north. It existed during and briefly after the colonial era, although not to anything like the extent it did in the south.</p>

<p>Has it ever occured to you that passage of the Atlantic Ocean was necessary to get the black slaves from Africa to the New World?  And who do you suppose profited handsomely for providing that transportation?  Wonder of wonders; it turns out Southerners didn&rsquo;t own many ships.  Transportation was almost exclusively furnished by Yankee merchant mariners.  Turns out Dixie had a partner in the dirty business.</p>
<p>And what about those Northern sweatshops anyway?</p>

<p>You provide no documentation or cite supporting evidence about your claim that the slave ships were all Yankee-owned. But the real point is WHY the ships sailed and WHERE they went. They came to the south and they came because of slavery. Had it not been for the south&rsquo;s self-induced heavy reliance on slave labor they wouldn&rsquo;t have come. What if the ships had gone to southern Argentina instead of the southern USA? Would it matter then? America wouldn&rsquo;t then have had a problem today. In any case the trans-Atlantic slave trade was ended twenty years after the revolution. The real damage was done when the south expanded slavery to nine other states. These slaves were moved westward from the seacoast, not from Africa.</p>
<p>As to the &#8220;northern sweatshops&#8221;, I find the comparison a bit specious, but the real point is what were the long term consequences of each respective situation. Eventually as labor conditions improved in the north, social mobility, intermarriage etc, dissolved societal schisms. This was impossible in the south because of the racially-based nature of southern slavery. To make the point in another way, what was worse for the long term good of the country; that some French-Canadian immigrant toiled in some miserable factory in New Hampshire, or that some black slave toiled in a cotton field in Alabama?   </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have to give you credit for your tenacity, but I think we&rsquo;ve both drawn this out to excess.  I have no documentation ready at hand to confirm the fact of Yankee profiteering in the slave trade.  Certainly British and other European shipping brought slaves from Africa, especially to the Carribean and Central and South America where 90+% were delivered.  But in my years of studying the subject, it has repeatedly come to my attention that Yankee merchant mariners were deeply involved in supplying the Southern states with their slaves, even after the trade was banned.  Those boats were carrying more than just whale blubber.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t morally defend the &#8220;peculiar institution&#8221; other than to murmer that we inherited it, and I concede that its effects were pretty universally detrimental.  R.E. Lee was most eloquently quoted after the war: &#8220;The best men of the South have long desired to do away with the institution and were quite willing to see it abolished.  But with them in relation to this subject the question has ever been &#8216;What will you do with the freed people?&rsquo;  That is the serious question to-day.&#8221;   </p>
<p>And to this day we live with the serious consequences  &mdash;  from the 14th and 15th Amendments to de-segregation, Civil Rights, and Affirmative Action  &mdash;  complements of Radical Republican Yankees, modern Democrats, and an authoritarian Federal Government.  </p>
<p>Case closed from this end.   </p>

<p>Best re-read True Blue&rsquo;s post.  He never said ALL slave ships were Yankee owned.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the real point is WHY the ships sailed and WHERE they went.&#8221;</p>
<p>ONCE AGAIN, you have chosen to include half the story on WHY the ships came to the South.  Of course they came to bring slaves, but take it a step further; why would that be?  BECAUSE THE SOUTHERN ECONOMY WAS BASED ON AGRICULTURE.  The South raised high demand crops that Europe and the NORTH wanted and couldn&rsquo;t provide (including rice, indigo, sugar, tobacco, tea, etc.) so of course the slaves would be needed in the South more so than the North.  I don&rsquo;t recall ever reading of the successful tobacco and sugar plantations of the north.  Europe knew the South&rsquo;s temperate climate and fertile soil, combined with an extended growing season, could supply what they needed, not unlike the Caribbean.  Why do you think so many rich Europeans settled in the South?</p>
<p>You want to blame someone for bringing blacks into this country?  Blame the 18th- 19th century economy, rich Europeans,  or the plain and simple fact that people must eat to survive.  </p>

      Cold hard facts ; The slaves were brought to North America exclusively by first the British then New Englanders, with all of the major European powers participating to varying degrees in North America . Outside of North America some of the European nations were into it in a big way . So what ? In a pre-industrial world, what else would you expect ? Nations and empires were built solely on human and animal labor. There is only minutest evidence any came over on a Southern ship . <br>
       The Father of our nation owned a plantation . So did Jefferson and Madison . If you wanted to make money and be productive that is how it was done in an agrarian world . No apologies needed . Large areas of New Amsterdam, D.C. and Philadelphia were built by slave labor. Independence Hall&hellip; built by slave labor.<br>
       The South accepted the only economic niche offered them . They were first a mercantilist colony of Britain and then New England . Of course Southerners were in it for the money, so was everybody else . That was one of the main motivators in coming to America . Every European nation was in it for the money .<br>
       Less than 19% of Southerners owned slaves . Less than 8% of the Atlantic slave trade came to what is now the United States . What this means is that had that 
        If you condemn the Confederacy as being treasonous, then you have to accept the fact the Continental Army and Congress were treasonous . Britain was their sovereign, period . All 13 colonies allowed slavery, all 13 colonies had slaves . Britain tried to utilize the slavery issue during the Revolution in exactly the same manner the Union would do so during the WBTS . Never mind that at that time Britain was solely responsible for having brought them here with the New Englanders picking up where the British left off after the Revolution .<br>
       Why all the crocodile tears over African bushmen who for the most part had not even attained a Cro-Magnon level of existence ? Not only were their descendants greatly blessed for their having been brought here, they themselves were . On the whole they have flourished here . Nowhere else in the New World is that true . Nowhere else in sub-Saharan Africa is that true . No one alive today in the U.S. has ever owned a slave, no one has been one . Stop apologizing to the African/American, stop groveling before him . Stop doing his work of bringing down all whites for him . His agenda is clear, to disfranchise all whites  &mdash;  - North and South . Just stand your ground with the facts in hand, peaceably .<br>
        I do not care if they choose not to fly the Confederate flag or if Georgia and Mississippi decide to change their state flags . If the Confederate flag is to be retired, then retire it with honor . But the Confederate flag is not going to be brought down in infamy amid half truths and lies at the behest of special interest groups serving a minority agenda . There will be resistance . <br>
        Southerners and mid-westerners were among the few who continued to stand by Old Glory during the Vietnam era . The Confederate flag never came up then but the American flag did . It was trampled and denigrated in just about every conceivable way . So why does it come up now ? Almost all attacks on the Confederacy now can be directly traced back to a certain representative who took over the reins of a certain special interest group that had become consumed in corruption and was losing members faster than a dead dog loses it&rsquo;s fleas . They are no more loyal to the American flag than they were during Vietnam . They claim to be, they fly it but when they finally dispose of the Confederacy and it&rsquo;s symbols they will again turn their attentions to  America, it&rsquo;s flags and symbols . I have a photograph of them burning Old Glory at the School of the America&rsquo;s after 9-11 . This same group stopped the SCV ( actually the SCV stepped aside to not involve the church ) from having it&rsquo;s meetings at a church that had been built by a Confederate veteran . <br>
     If you voluntarily keep feeding a gator, he will keep coming back . You can depend on it . So we all need to pull together and face our common opponents in a gentlemanly manner . It&rsquo;s imperative .</p>
