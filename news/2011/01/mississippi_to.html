<h1><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/30/mississippi-to-teach-civi_n_802786.html">Mississippi to Teach Civil Rights History in Every Grade</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huffington Post, December 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Teacher John Paola says his high school history course in southern Mississippi would be incomplete if it didn&rsquo;t include an emphasis on the turbulent civil rights struggle of America&rsquo;s South.</p>
<p>For years, the auburn-haired white man has educated students about activists in their own state who led peaceful demonstrations, and the wrath of segregationists who channeled violence to repress social change.</p>
<p>Soon, civil rights lessons be will required for students from kindergarten to 12th grade all across Mississippi.</p>
<p>A civil rights/human rights curriculum becomes mandatory in all public schools for the 2011-2012 school year, five years after Gov. Haley Barbour signed the requirement into law.</p>
<p>Civil rights is typically a part of social studies programs in the nation&rsquo;s public schools. State officials believe Mississippi is the first state to require civil rights studies throughout all grades in its public school systems. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;To not know history is to repeat it. And to learn the good things about Mississippi and America and the bad things about Mississippi and America is important for every Mississippian,&#8221; Barbour said when asked about the curriculum during an interview with The Associated Press in December.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To ensure civil rights are taught in the schools, the state has made the subject part of an assessment test students must pass for graduation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not everyone is pleased with the new civil rights emphasis.</p>
<p>Rep. John Moore, R-Brandon, has filed a bill to repeal the law nearly every year since 2006. Moore, who lives in a suburb of Jackson, said he wants to know who will write the textbooks and craft the materials students will be taught.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want schools to be teaching my grandchildren to read, write a complete sentence and do math,&#8221; Moore said. &#8220;I just want to make sure it&rsquo;s teaching the truth and facts and not being accusatory of one group of people or the other. I don&rsquo;t want it to be somebody&rsquo;s philosophical idea of what civil rights are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The state Department of Education hasn&rsquo;t found another state with framework that incorporates civil rights studies in grades K-12, said Chauncey Spears, who works in the Mississippi agency&rsquo;s curriculum and instruction office.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s hope their White parents have seen Pat Buchanan on TV snarling about how generous we have been to the afrovoodoos and how we get no gratitude from them.</p>
<p>Our mission would take a huge step forward if the White students in Miss. keep asking their teachers: &#8220;After all we&rsquo;ve done for them in righting the wrongs of the past, why do they continue to breed illegitimate babies, sell drugs, and rob, rape, and murder as part on their typical behavior?  Shouldn&rsquo;t they all be acting Whiter about now? And why aren&rsquo;t they asking us to help them get home to Africa where they wouldn&rsquo;t suffer from our unacknowledged racisms?&#8221;<br>

		<p>Have no fear, the graduates of the state schools will still be functional illiterates incapable of balancing a checkbook. But they&rsquo;ll have memorized a battery of &#8220;hate Whitey&#8221; trivia. In other words, they&rsquo;ll be perfectly equipped for American college.</p>

		<p>I think that this would amount to political indoctrination at best. Isnt there enough of this during &#8220;black history month&#8221;? Kids get a generous helping of white guilt from kindergarten through 12th grade to begin with. Now they would have to vomit back &#8220;facts&#8221; that some white hating feminist has come up with or not recieve a diploma. Since private schools would likely have to come to the same standards this is a good reason to home school your kids- at the very least you would have to do some damage control by countering what your kids are learning at school. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Civil rights&#8221; = &#8220;Blacks FORCING themselves into white people&rsquo;s living space&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ALL it can possibly mean. If whites were being &#8216;racist&rsquo; (i.e. simply wanting to live around their own kind) then the blacks should have been demanding separation, not &#8216;integration&rsquo; (forcing themselves into white people&rsquo;s living space).</p>
<p>Nobody has a right to FORCE themselves into the company of other people who don&rsquo;t want them.</p>
<p>Therefore it wasn&rsquo;t &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; at all.</p>

		<p>Someone, somewhere must think the white guilt is slipping a notch in MS, because they are certainly pulling out all the stops here. What a waste of time when American children can&rsquo;t keep up with other countries in math, science and reading. It&rsquo;s no wonder this nation is crumbling when honors english classes are taken away because the class is too white, and teaching how evil whites are has become more important. The comments on that article are depressing to read, but I&rsquo;ve also noticed that those same people usually live in all white neighborhoods, send their children to private schools, and have had little or no contact with minorties.</p>

		<p>Just what our youth need,more fluff history,which I&rsquo;m sure will be taught with a liberal spin.Which real contributors to America&rsquo;s greatness will be expunged to make room for MLK,MalcolmX and Stokley Carmichael? How much fair presentation will George Wallace or Lester Maddox get? In South Carolina the NAACP can&rsquo;t come to grips with history to allow the Confederate flag to fly over a soldiers memorial without whining. I&rsquo;m sure the curriculum of these courses will be pure liberal propaganda. Hey,only 27 days until black history month!</p>

		<p>If a parent absolutely must put their child in a public school, then they must turn the TV off and do the best to show the child the truth.  Take an afternoon drive to downtown Jackson and look at the urban decay.  Then go to an opera or a classical European art exhibit.<br>

		<p>I get the feeling John Moore has nothing to worry about, re his grandchildren.  Since he&rsquo;s white, they&rsquo;re white, and since they&rsquo;re white and in Mississippi and probably relatively well off, they&rsquo;re probably going to private schools.  Mississippi&rsquo;s public schools are mostly black anyway, and I would imagine &#8220;civil rights&#8221; have been the order of the day for quite a long time.</p>

		<p>After seeing black nonsense grow ever more egregious for the last 40 years, I&rsquo;d have to say the segregationists were RIGHT after all, if not on method, then in the outcome.<br>
And, given things like torch burnings of 12 year old white boys, or Newsome Christian, etc, I am leaning more sympathetically toward the segregationists methods also.</p>

I will make a prediction.</p>
<p>White kids will see this as just another part of their education and study accordingly to get good grades. Whites will end up surpassing blacks in their knowledge of black history.<br>
Blacks will become angry that &#8216;the system&rsquo; has failed them again.</p>

		<p>A quick internet search will tell you that Mississippi is at or near the bottom in education.  Is that something they should strive to reverse?  Nope.  Instead they should focus on this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon, civil rights lessons be will required for students from kindergarten to 12th grade all across Mississippi.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which should read like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon, anti-white indoctrination be will required for students from kindergarten to 12th grade all across Mississippi.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pretty sad when &#8220;leaders&#8221; there are just fine with being at the bottom in education as long as the liberal agenda is being shoved down the citizens throats.</p>

<p>  <br>
The controlled media always portrays Haley Barbour as a far right conservative Republican. Far from being a Neo-Confederate, Barbour is a member in good standing of our multicultural-loving privileged elites. In laymen&rsquo;s terms, Barbour is not an extreme liberal, like the controlled media, but only a moderate liberal. However, his Mississippi birth and Southern accent are unacceptable to the Northeast&rsquo;s hoity- toity plutocratic oligarchs. </p>

		<p>This is yet another reason to home school your children.  Our public schools have long been centers of indoctrination.  Opposition to home schooling mostly comes from leftists who are angered by the thought that some children might be able to bypass the indoctrination.<br>

<p>Your prediction is absolutely correct based on the experience I had while taking a college level civil rights history course a few years ago. I needed an elective and I enjoy history of any sort so I signed up. The class consisted of twenty students, fifteen black and five white and a black professor. While I expected the professor to be a typical liberal filled with animosity towards white people, he was actually fairly reasonable and tolerated objections and differing points of view so long as they were presented in a respectful manner. </p>
<p>Before we took tests this professor held a review session which  allowed students to get up to ten bonus points that could be applied to any future assignment. He would ask questions about the material we had covered and the first person to answer correctly would get the points. In every review session it was the white students who had studied and knew the material while the black students sat around texting and sleeping. By the time the third review session came up his professor had become extremely frustrated with the black students lack of interest in a topic that seemingly would be important to them. When he asked the first question and five white hands shot up the poor man just lost his composure. Tears of anger filled his eyes and he lost it, saying, in effect, that the black students were an embarrassment and he had become convinced that the civil rights movement was all for nothing. This was met with cries of racism and he was called an Uncle Tom. He packed up his briefcase and silently walked out of the room.</p>
<p>The final assignment for the class was to write a fifteen page paper on any aspect of the civil rights movement. My paper was titled &#8220;The Unintended Consequences of the Civil Rights Movement&#8221;. A day after I had submitted the paper I received and email from the professor requesting that I visit his office. I thought he was going to rip my paper apart and possibly fail me. Instead he told me that he thought I had raised a lot of valid points that he had not really considered before. He told me that he gave me an &#8216;A&rsquo; for the paper and the course and then he apologized for the troubling way that some of the students had behaved. I asked him if he would be coming back to teach in the upcoming semester and he said that he was so disillusioned that he just wanted to go back to working in his family&rsquo;s business. </p>
<p>I apologize for the length of this post but this incident really clarified many racial issues for me. I share the conviction of that professor that teaching civil rights is truly a pointless endeavor. </p>

<p>Funny you say that.  When I was a sophomore in high school, I was in one of those academic quiz bowls, held on the campus of the historically black college (now university) in St. Louis.  I scored a fair number of points for my team in the &#8220;black history&#8221; topic thanks to my (what is usually) useless knowledge of black singers like Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, the Mills Brothers, and others.  </p>
