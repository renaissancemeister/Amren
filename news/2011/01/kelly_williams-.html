<h1>Kelly Williams-Bolar: Mother Jailed for Sending Kids to the Wrong School District</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Boyce Watkins, PhD, Black Voices, January 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When I read about the case of Kelly Williams-Bolar, I find myself confused. The 40-year-old Ohio mother of two is being sent to jail for using her father&rsquo;s address to send her two daughters to a school in a better district. Williams-Bolar lives in a housing project in Akron, Ohio, and had sent her children to school in Copley Township using her father&rsquo;s address.</p>
<p>Williams-Bolar&rsquo;s father, Edward Williams, is also being charged with fourth-degree grand theft for stealing more than $30,000 in school services for the two girls. Williams-Bolar herself will spend 10 days in jail and be placed on probation. Also, the judge in the case, Patricia Cosgrove, made it clear that she was using Williams-Bolar to set an example for other parents who consider doing the same thing. {snip}</p>
<p>Besides being a single mom, Williams-Bolar was going to school part time in the hope of getting a job as a teacher. The judge noted that because Williams-Bolar has been convicted of a felony, she will no longer be allowed to teach in the state of Ohio. {snip}</p>
<p>The Kelly Williams-Bolar case strikes a chord with quite a few people in the black community for a few reasons. Most directly, a lot of kids can remember their own mothers doing the same thing to try to break the cycle of poverty that so many of us confront as children. Inner-city schools are inadequately funded, so many parents have no choice when it comes to finding ways to get their kids a good education. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The idea that citizens are now being put in jail for attempting to access educational equality is nothing short of being Jim Crow-like in nature.</p>
<p>Black family economic inequality also plays a huge role in this case. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that the judge would have been compelled to make an example out of Williams-Bolar were she not a poor single mother from the projects. If she were a wealthy woman from the suburbs, she would have been able to afford the kinds of attorneys that keep people out of jail, and she also would not have been forced to break the law to help her girls get access to a good school. {snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Martin Luther King reminded us many years ago that a moral man or woman has the right to violate unjust laws. Williams-Bolar&rsquo;s decision to break the law of educational apartheid to give her daughters a better future is no different from those who broke the law to teach slaves how to read. {snip}<br>

		<p>A great many black people desperately, desperately want to get away from other Blacks and get into a White community.  These Blacks are prejudiced and racist; they believe that a Black community is inferior to a White community. </p>

		<p>This story has gotten a lot airtime on local NE Ohio talk radio and has been portrayed as a poor black parent fleeing the poor underfunded urban schools. The fact is, Copley-Fairlawn receives $9.258 funding per pupil and 75% of that money comes from local funding. Akron City Schools receive $13,374 funding per pupil and only 37.% of that funding is local.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black family economic inequality also plays a huge role in this case.&#8221; </p>
<p>Akron met 4 of 26 state measures with their &#8220;underfunded&#8221; schools. </p>

		<p> I don&rsquo;t blame her one bit. The state uses inner city schools to experiment rather than educate. We are going to see the homeschool movement take over since loving parents aren&rsquo;t going to just sit down and watch their childrens lives ruined.</p>

		<p>Wow. It truly boggles the mind how predictable blacks are when it comes to the way they write. </p>
<p>I have said it before on this site: I can always, always tell when something was written by a black. They have this curious and unique way of stringing words together and very often putting inappropriate word combinations in the wrong place. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very strange how unbelievable similar they all sound to each other. </p>

		<p>So, let me get this straight   &mdash;   we are locking up and branding a criminal a US citizen who, if she were an illegal alien, would be lauded up one side and down the other?</p>
<p>I think it speaks well for the mother that she wanted her kids to get an education and, being poor, found a way to let it happen.  State schools   &mdash;   presumably the same state   &mdash;   but a different school district.</p>
<p>But, Why, dammit, Why is race any part of the issue here? The answer is that it is not, other than in the mind of the author.</p>

		<p>More black apologetics and lies.  Inner city schools are funded below &#8220;good&#8221; suburban schools?  a LIE.  Per student, we spend two to three times as much on blacks in inner cities as is spent on suburban and mostly white rural schools.  And it&rsquo;s done NO good.</p>
<p>They fail.  Their schools fail.  When are we going to finally tell blacks that their kids will NOT do better by osmosis sitting in a class full of white kids.  That the problem with black kids is their attitude, their laziness, their short attention span, their innate ability or lack of it, and their universal penchant for being disruptive and violent.  NO black kid will study.  That&rsquo;s called &#8220;acting white&#8221;.  And they won&rsquo;t &#8220;act white&#8221; in a majority white class either.  The majority white class will instead begin &#8220;acting black&#8221; the more blacks invade the classroom.  I am really sick of the excuses, and if the black parents were responsible parents instead of white hating entitlement minded excuse makers, they would be sick of the excuses themselves and MAKE their kids behave, study, sit down and shut up.  But when you have black adults and black mothers tearing up an IHOP, or a gas station parking lot, or a Kentucky Fried Chicken, or a Denny&rsquo;s, we should not wonder why the kids act the same way.  When was the last time anybody heard about a bunch of white women tearing up a restaurant in large numbers over something silly and stupid?  Never.  It&rsquo;s a black thing and the women (many of whom are mothers) are often much worse in impulsive violence than black males, if one can imagine such a thing.</p>

		<p>This leaves quite a bit out&hellip; There were originally 40 total non-residents. The other 39 paid up and/or left. She is the only one who continued merrily stealing taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The court was lenient BECAUSE she&rsquo;s &#8220;minority&#8221;. The judge, being the good little diversicrat, offered to write a letter stating she SHOULD NOT lose her teaching license. (How you get the license BEFORE completing the education, I have no clue&hellip;)</p>

		<p>From the article: &#8220;Dr. Martin Luther King reminded us many years ago that a moral man or woman has the right to violate unjust laws.&#8221; </p>
<p>He did? That&rsquo;s rather subjective. I didn&rsquo;t know Marty was also a judge. Apparently, Marty also found those pesky plagiarism laws unjust. Along with who knows how many other laws? </p>
<p>Besides, that a sickening comment and a race-card excuse to disregard whatever law you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Along those lines, then I can say I don&rsquo;t want any blacks in my neighborhood and the so-called fair housing laws are an unjust encroachment on my freedoms. Therefore, I refuse to sell my house to blacks or rent to blacks or allow blacks into private shops in my neighborhood. Hey - that&rsquo;s what Marty would have wanted.</p>
<p>My advice to the woman: move into a better school district. She should definitely be in jail. Busing is bad enough - now we have blacks simply showing up in some city or town and taking further advantage of white taxpayers. This woman knew the law. Another disgraceful role model for black children, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</p>
<p>Several liberal news organizations portray this woman as a hero as she says, &#8220;I just wanted to help my kids to a better education.&#8221; Okay, I think I&rsquo;ll go a really fancy restaurant and not pay because I just wanted my kids to get a better meal. Or move into a new but unsold house because I just wanted my kids to live in a nicer place. There&rsquo;s no end to it. </p>
<p>Her district probably gets extra state (white) money for the failing school where her little ones are enrolled. </p>
<p>Here are two more classic pieces from the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea that citizens are now being put in jail for attempting to access educational equality is nothing short of being Jim Crow-like in nature.&#8221; Give me a break! Of course, when all else fails, bring up Jim Crow. </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>&#8220;Black family economic inequality also plays a huge role in this case. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that the judge would have been compelled to make an example out of Williams-Bolar were she not a poor single mother from the projects. If she were a wealthy woman from the suburbs, she would have been able to afford the kinds of attorneys that keep people out of jail, and she also would not have been forced to break the law to help her girls get access to a good school.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s called intelligence and upward mobility. Blacks are so self-centered, short-sighted, and stupid it practically jumps off the page. </p>
<p>Does this woman not realize where the money comes from for the better school district? Does she not realize that if this starts happening the school districts cannot plan for the year ahead because of enrollment variations, not to mention increased costs for special ed programs and security? What about the threat of ghetto lottery lawsuits the schools would face? </p>
<p>Oh, and how unfair it is for the families who worked hard and saved so they could afford to move into better school districts?</p>
<p>And check out the video of Williams-Bolar wailing while in court. Enough said. </p>

		<p><i>Inner-city schools are inadequately funded, so many parents have no choice when it comes to finding ways to get their kids a good education.</i></p>
<p>Wrong.  Inner-city school districts are usually better funded (per student per year) than the suburban white schools that black parents like these seem to want to cheat to get their children into.</p>
<p><i>If she were a wealthy woman from the suburbs, she would have been able to afford the kinds of attorneys that keep people out of jail&hellip;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting tired of that false bromide as well.  Not even Perry Mason can keep you from being found guilty if the evidence to convince a jury unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt is there.  If anything, blacks have the wind to their backs in the CJ system, because of nullification-happy black juries and lenient white liberal or black judges.</p>
<p>They make Miss Williams-Bolar out to be a hero.  Yet, 15-20 years ago, when a lot of parents, overwhelmingly white and mostly fundamentalist-evangelical Christian thought the public schools were miseducating their children, and decided to educate them themselves, (home schooling), the movement was treated by the mainstream media of the day with scorn and derision.</p>
<p>MLK did say that we had a right to disobey unjust laws.  Yet he also said that we had to accept the legal consequences of doing so.  (If &#8220;he&#8221; really said it, and not one of his overtly Marxist white handlers.)  But I fail to see how laws mandating that you have to use the public schools for your children based on your residency are unjust.</p>

<p>Pure nonsense, of course, and typical black thinking. The reasonable person, if he feels a law is unjust, will work to change it. The idiotic MLK quote can be used to justify the breaking of any law. </p>
<p>And I very much doubt that the woman with the hyphenated name was sent to jail simply for using her father&rsquo;s address to send her two daughters to a school in a better district. There&rsquo;s more to this story than we&rsquo;re being told. Much more.</p>
<p><i> Williams-Bolar&rsquo;s father, Edward Williams, is also being charged with fourth-degree grand theft for stealing more than $30,000 in school services for the two girls. </i> </p>
<p>Hmmm, something tells me that the crime was more than just sending the children to a different school district.</p>

		<p>All blacks seem to be able to talk about is how every problem that comes their way is based on RACISM and this never ending gobbledegook concerning slavery.

		<p>I wonder what the population density of blacks is in Copley Township.  Clearly her father lives there but it must have been pretty obvious (Rest home?  If the mother is 40&hellip;) or they would not have been able to tag her so readily.  30,000 dollars is also a lot of money, even if it&rsquo;s over several years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m frankly suspicious of anyone who has the money to drive to the suburbs to pick up her kids from school but needs to schlep a job by volunteering, part time (another possible means for catching her, if she had to register any secondary income).</p>
<p>Of course you get the great big sympathy play for &#8220;Ome bayuh-beez!&#8221; as a woman looking to educate her two kids outside a project environment.  Never realizing that she and her children are not &#8216;refugees from&rsquo; but THE problem, itself.</p>
<p>I hope Copeland is 90% white or better.  I hope they stay that way.  Here&rsquo;s a glass raised to a female judge unafraid to make an exampe painful enough to hopefully not to have to be repeated.</p>

<p>Yeah, and that &#8220;wealthy woman from the suburbs&#8221; - meaning White -probably worked her tail off and didn&rsquo;t HAVE KIDS OUT OF WEDLOCK to get there! <br>
Ms. Kelly Williams-Bolar could&rsquo;ve been a wealthy woman from the suburbs too had she made &#8216;mo bedda&rsquo; decisions in her life.<br>
And I&rsquo;m sure that as soon as she got her two girls [ I bet they&rsquo;re little angels ] in that school, the whining would start - &#8220;there&rsquo;s no black teachers there as role models, there&rsquo;s just a few other black students there for them to &#8220;relate&#8221; to so they feel so isolated, my kids get punished more than the White kids do, there&rsquo;s no black study classes there for them to learn their culture, &#8216;someone&rsquo; drew a noose on the restroom wall&#8221; &hellip; well you get the picture.</p>
<p>Inner-city schools are inadequately funded,-</p>
<p>This is an out and out lie that needs to be shouted down at every opportunity. It&rsquo;s a fact that &#8220;inner-city&#8221; [ black ] schools are usually always funded more than other [ White ] schools. The D.C. school district is the highest funded school district in the country, yet its stats are at the bottom.</p>

		<p>The county across the river from me in Georgia has this problem.  But the school board does nothing about it.  It&rsquo;s common to see tags from 4 counties dropping kids off every day.  It&rsquo;s about time people were prosecuted for this since it most absolutely IS stealing resources from other children who belong in those schools.  This is not a race issue at all, but I wager a token white case will be next.  Only they will stay in jail longer to satisfy the equal-punishment whiners.<br>

		<p>Kelly Williams-Bolar did what many parents in abject school districts would like to do, but don&rsquo;t because they are fearful of breaking the law and being caught. She took her chances, and eventually the authorities caught up with her.</p>
<p>Using this case as an example, Patricia Cosgrove is only trying to prevent what could become a crisis for many other school districts, which is the unfair and illegal practice of ripping off the schools and parents who have worked hard to have their children where they are.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Boyce Watkins makes no mention of the fact that two seats were lost for whatever period belonging to two rightful owners living legally in the district. Just because Williams-Bolar couldn&rsquo;t afford to live in the area doesn&rsquo;t mean she had any right to break the law, regardless of Watkins&rsquo; groundless &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cause I&rsquo;m black and poor�? argument. Watkins also fails to respect the law that is used to protect local citizens. Would it be fair to take tax dollars designated for education from people living in one town and give it directly to others in another without governmental sanctions? This case has nothing to do with racial discrimination because of one simple fact: millions of whites, blacks, Hispanics, and other races across the nation obey such boundary laws. Another thing Watkins seems not to understand is that blacks aren&rsquo;t the only poor people in this country wanting a better life for their kids, leaving the argument to be one-sided and unjust. Finally, bringing up the reason why Williams-Bolar won&rsquo;t be able to teach in Ohio points to another law trespassed. Incredibly, Watkins has the audacity to imply that the two lawbreakers should be pardoned for both criminal acts simply because they are black and poor. Pure rubbish.</p>

		<p>This issue is not so simple. Many teachers wail about how underfunded schools are, but even the cheaper ones cost US$6,000 per child per year. So, where a child goes to school is a large financial concern for the local Board of Education.</p>
<p>Over 10 years ago, I remember a neighbor considering taking in a high school niece from another state for the school year. He looked into it and it was illegal to simply board a relative with a non-resident parent and send her to a local school. He would have had to file Court papers to have him appointed as her Legal Guardian. So, the women in question did something flat out illegal and is now yelling about it.</p>
<p>Well, for all of the Black Rage, a White family would be in the same situation. This is a school bureaucracy problem not a race problem.</p>

		<p>I am both appalled and confused by the contradictory statements being rattled about here. I used to work in Ohio, and in that state, each county/city had it&rsquo;s own tax rate, which meant I had to pay TWO taxes, because I taught in one county, and lived in another, and no one bothered to tell me that such was the case. </p>
<p>When my wife and I were both pursuing jobs/educations across states, our children were entering K-1st elem. school. Because the wife&rsquo;s mom lived in an adjoining community, we ASKED the school district in that community, if our children could attend a local school THERE,  and that mom-in-law would be the &#8216;supervisory adult,&rsquo; where the kids were picked up and dropped off at her senior condo, so that an adult would be able to &#8216;watch them&rsquo; in that &#8216;no man&rsquo;s land&rsquo; of my wife leaving for work before the school day, and only picking them up AFTER the school day.&rsquo;  Grandma was a surrogate parent, and child caregiver before and after school.</p>
<p>Since our state does not have Ohio&rsquo;s odd laws, the Principal wasn&rsquo;t &#8216;shutting out&rsquo; students in his area, nor were we &#8216;stealing&rsquo; from a district, (as all our taxes go for el. ed. and only the &#8216;extras&rsquo; are given via the local tax revenues) and he gladly took our kids in, even knowing that our home address was &#8216;over the line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, unless I am missing something here, I think this woman and her father were trying their best to raise the children&rsquo;s standard of education&hellip; especially if SHE were seeking a teaching credential.</p>
<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve homeschooled my kids for four years, (The moral/cultural &#8216;education&rsquo; indoctrination were a whole OTHER matter that led us to take our kids out after one year) and after the wife retires, she&rsquo;s taking over that job, now that I have my PhD (Finally!). And I see the utterly corrupt and drone-like status quo ALL American Students have, BECAUSE of the FEDERAL INDOCTRINATION CENTERS&hellip; err, public school.</p>
<p>Charlotte Isserbyt was correct. Dewey and Mann&rsquo;s desire to have a servant class of &#8216;dumbed down drones&rsquo; is ALL &#8216;education&rsquo; is about these days. Better to homeschool your kids, at whatever cost, than send them into the maw of a Public School. The whole institution is utterly bankrupt. and naught but a tool of Marxist rhetoric, and amoral bestiality.</p>

		<p>&#8220;talk radio and has been portrayed as a poor black parent fleeing the poor underfunded urban schools. The fact is, Copley-Fairlawn receives $9.258 funding per pupil and 75% of that money comes from local funding. Akron City Schools receive $13,374 funding per pupil and only 37.% of that funding is local&#8221;.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting away with it from all sources and from all angles. Respectible conservatives, on occassion, will say something like, &#8220;it&rsquo;s no so bad for minorities&#8221;. The only ones who will challenge this all pervasive propaganda are underground groups like AmRen and most of even Those groups have questionable motives as it is. They&rsquo;ve been getting away with it for 50 years if not since the first whites set foot on the continent. It&rsquo;s a wonder it&rsquo;s not the very reason there was &#8216;slavery&rsquo; in this country in the first place.</p>

<p>SO many comments seem to be MISSING THE POINT. The reason the schools around the projects are bad is BECAUSE OF THE BLACKS, if the blacks went to &#8216;good&rsquo;(white) schools those schools would be bad too!</p>
<p>Segregation is the solution. Not whites paying for worthless black schools.<br>
This woman drives and lives on our tax dollar, doesn&rsquo;t want to send her kids to a school which likely gets 20k a year from your stolen wages. </p>
<p>Race is genetics, Genetics is intelligence. Also: It&rsquo;s not really stealing anything, blacks do not pay for their own schools, it&rsquo;s all our tax dollars anyways.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Dr. Martin Luther King reminded us many years ago that a moral man or woman has the right to violate unjust laws.&#8221;  If what I was taught in college is actually true  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;m not saying it is  &mdash;  King was a fan of Thoreau, and of Thoreau&rsquo;s teaching of non violent protest through example.  Thoreau happily went to jail, so the story goes, rather than pay a tax supporting local churches.  Indeed, he was said to have been quite upset when someone, presumably other Transcendentalists, made his bail for him (probably apocryphal).  King was said to have merrily went to Birmingham jail where he plagiarized his famous letter.  The point is, as someone else above has pointed out  &mdash;  you have the moral right to violate unjust laws, but you must be prepared to pay the consequences.  To give this woman the same standing as Mr. Thoreau, or even someone of lesser stature such as King, would require that she openly enrolled her daughter and was prepared to pay the price, not sneaking around and crying when she got caught.  Having said that, I certainly cannot blame her for trying to better her children, although someone was quite right to point out that if she were an illegal immigrant she would be applauded.  Why shouldn&rsquo;t the DREAM act apply to local school districts and blacks as well as mexicans?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have the numbers but blacks in Buffalo no longer use that argument because city schools have for the past decade or longer surpassed suburban schools in cost per student. And black failure to graduate rates stands at 53% and rising.</p>

<p>Really? They no longer use that argument? </p>
<p>When I was in college in Ohio studying school teaching 20 years ago, our profs taught us that inner city schools were being underfunded compared to suburban schools. There were even films about it, if I remember right. The major papers picked up this story. There was even an amendment proposed in the Ohio legislature that all schools be funded equally. During the entire process, the amendment, media coverage, school teacher education, inner city schools in most if not every large city in Ohio had considerably more money per pupil than did suburban schools. It&rsquo;s not much different that talk radio&rsquo;s apparent coverage of this event 20 years later? </p>

		<p>I come from a long line of people who tend to lean toward a Jim Crow way of thinking and I have those leanings as well. I am one of the people who would prefer to have the vast majority of American Blacks on the other side of a well-guarded border that separates most of them from most of us. My take on this story is that this Ohio mother might be one of the people that I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having on my side of the fence.</p>
<p>The most common complaints that guys like me have about Blacks is that they don&rsquo;t take care of their kids, they don&rsquo;t care about education and they don&rsquo;t try to improve their lot in life. </p>
<p>The evidence suggests that none of those complaints apply to this woman. She apparently looked at her surroundings and decided that she didn&rsquo;t want projects and thugs to be part of her children&rsquo;s future and she chose the best options she had available to her to alter her family&rsquo;s trajectory: education for herself and better learning opportunities for her children. I cannot understand why this woman got slammed for living up to the expectations we hold up for Blacks at the same time that most of the country is bending over frontwards to mollycoddle the trashy elements of America&rsquo;s Black population.</p>
<p>Good job. We turned this concerned mother who wanted to be a teacher into just another Black felon in the projects. We can always use more of those.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the kids. They&rsquo;ll still get an education. Between MTV, BET and their little school friends from the projects they will learn everything they need to know to be part of the next generation of Blacks that we will complain about.</p>

		<p>Why didn&rsquo;t her father let them live with him if the school was so important? Because she wouldn&rsquo;t get those welfare freebies. </p>
<p>She gets free housing, free utilities, probably a free cell phone, she puts her car in someone else&rsquo;s name so she can get free food stamps, free medical care, go to college for free, get them to pay all her expenses - heck they probably even gave her a free laptop to help this poor person. Meanwhile, I graduated 15 years ago and am still paying student loans. Where&rsquo;s the fairness in that? Oh right. It&rsquo;s cos I&rsquo;m not a minority.</p>

		<p>Can someone explain to me why so many so-called conservatives support school choice and school vouchers?  Dick Morris is a big supporter.  He was on a radio talk show this afternoon and said his goal is to integrate all-white schools with choice and vouchers. The host is also a big supporter.  I wonder if he would like 500 students from Camden, NJ enrolling in his kid&rsquo;s school next week.  I would love for someone to ask one of these well-known supporters (Sean Hannity, Newt Gingrich, etc.) this question.  Can you imagine the look on their faces!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a retired educator who taught for thirty-three years in an urban school system. I know of many city educators (black and white), who lived in a surrounding county, but had their children placed in the best schools in the city. Why? They wanted to be near their children in case of an emergency (think 9-11, civil disturbances, etc.) and the county schools where they were zoned were inferior (think minority).  All of the best elementary/middle schools in the city are in predominantly white neighborhoods. Surprised? I don&rsquo;t condemn parents who want their children in a safe, positive, and academically inclined environment. </p>

		<p>Because she is black this story is getting so much press. Here in St. Louis this has been going on for years. Except it is whites that are doing it. Here the school boundries are very stange. Your local township may be majority white and very nice but tyour local school is 70% black. So many parents use a relative or even rent a apartment in the better school district.<br>
One of the trick is depending on the rules is to show a utility bill for proof of address. You can even use a friends address but put a extra phone line in under your name.</p>

		<p>Yes, whether they are moral or not, anyone can violate the law. Whether they find he law unjust or not in simply their own opinion. Society does not have unjust laws.</p>
<p>Likewise, everyone who violates the law can expect, with a certain degree of certainty, that they will be arrested and charged with their crimes&hellip;.and they must accept the consequences (read: penalties) of having willfully violated the law. </p>
