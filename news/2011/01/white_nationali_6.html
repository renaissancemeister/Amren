<h1>White Nationalist Leader Blasts Charlotte Critics</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Morrill, Charlotte Observer, January 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A white nationalist leader said today he hasn&rsquo;t given up on holding a weekend conference in Charlotte despite what he called &#8220;contemptible&#8221; efforts to dissuade local hotels from hosting it.</p>
<p>Surrounded by more police than protesters, Jared Taylor blasted the Sheraton Charlotte Airport hotel as well as two city council members he said helped persuade the hotel to cancel the planned weekend gathering.</p>
<p>Taylor is editor of American Renaissance, a Virginia-based magazine of &#8220;racial-realist thought.&#8221; The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such groups, says the Renaissance conferences attract &#8220;racist &#8216;intellectuals&rsquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Klansmen, neo-Nazis and other white supremacists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor, speaking to reporters outside the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center, rejected the characterization.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s nothing the slightest but supremacist about it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is middle-aged men in suits giving speeches to other middle-aged men in suits. I can&rsquo;t imagine anything more boring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor alluded to the apparent involvement in the matter by Mayor Pro Tem Patrick Cannon.</p>
<p>An e-mail Cannon sent to a constituent early this week suggested he was lobbying local hotels to refuse to book American Renaissance. Cannon wrote that he had contacted hotels and that &#8220;they seem to be cooperating.&#8221; Councilman Warren Turner was also reportedly involved, though Turner has denied contacting hotels.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you know, Mr. Cannon and Mr. Turner are both black,&#8221; Taylor said. He asked them both to apologize.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Cannon nor Turner could be reached.</p>
<p>Taylor compared his situation to that of another controversial figure, Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan. &#8220;Imagine if two white city council, members had gotten together to run him out of town,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Imagine the uproar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor said he&rsquo;s asked the 100 or so who had planned to attend the weekend conference to &#8220;keep (their) powder dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can&rsquo;t find a place to meet we can&rsquo;t find a place to meet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we&rsquo;re hoping to have a conference.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If there is an up side to this black-backed hatred, it is that even more people will now be clicking onto Amren to see what the uproar is all about, which will increase membership to the organization, just as the unjust attack did regarding the Arizona debacle.  I notice we have hundreds of new readers from that.</p>

		<p>Good luck with that apology. How 19th century of you. If you really beleive in your case (as I do) you should do the right honorable thing in 21st century terms and sue the city, the individual councilmembers, and the Hotel. then, perhaps, youll get their attention. hit them where it hurts: the wallet</p>

		<p>I like to go to Freerepublic.com because it&rsquo;s useful in finding all the important news of the day.  But I&rsquo;ve long been aware of how this &#8220;conservative&#8221; site is with white nationalist issues.  I was browsing when I saw someone posted a link to the Examiner&rsquo;s article about Jared Taylor&rsquo;s press conference.  I waited a few minutes because I wanted to see the comments by people on Freerepublic about this issue.  However, a few minutes later when I went back the post about AR had disappeared.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just men in suits.  Certainly not here on the discussion boards.</p>
<p>I hope you win or at least receive a large settlement in compensation for your inconvenience and breach of contract but please understand that you have a grass roots support element as well.</p>
<p>And while we don&rsquo;t take lightly to being deemed Neo-Nazis or Supremacists or K as a smear, nor do we consider this to be &#8216;just boring speeches between aging white males in suits&rsquo;.  At least three, daily, posters with eloquent and incisive responses are female and that number grows, weekly.  Several are Jewish.  Occasional Indian and other SWA&rsquo;ian posters also write in.  And -many- are from Overseas Europe and Australia where free speech on this subject is severely inhibited and the ability to travel to America for the conference not economically feasible.</p>
<p>Our concerns are multinational, multi-ethnic and multi-gendered and dare I say, multi-age and SES backgrounded.  Thus they qualify for protection under the definition of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; in it&rsquo;s truest sense.</p>
<p>As such, this Conference, when broadcast over internet, becomes a major forum for subject exchanges and learning for those of us who hold this point of view but cannot afford to directly attend.</p>
<p>And so by denying us the right to see it as a community, it becomes a Free Speech issue to far more than the immediate 100 people whom I&rsquo;m sorry to see disappointed again.</p>

		<p>From the letters to the Editor and the local call-ins, it seems this situation has added momentum and helped draw more Whites out of complacency.</p>
<p>While I did not &#8220;see&#8221; the press conference, Me Taylors  appearance and demeanor helped dispel the  stereotype.</p>

		<p>Blacks are the biggest hypocrites on the planet.</p>
<p>All whites should boycott the Sheraton hotel chain (and any subsidiaries if there are any) and other companies that have such a glaring double standard like Fox News (which is about as pro-white as NAACP).  There is no solidarity among whites and we do nothing as a group to promote our self-interests.  The few whites that have the courage to stand up for us get ignored, vilified and thrown to the curb.<br>

		<p>I would like to thank Mr Taylor for taking the high road,as well as, the offensive in this case. He is absolutely right in the facts he presented. If white members of the city council or any branch of government were to try to block or disrupt any minority meeting, then they would be ran out of office and all sorts of hell would be raised. Men of good character must take the fight to our government to preserve our Constitutional Rights and our Race. May God give American Renaissance wisdom, Grace, and strength to do the right thing&hellip;</p>

		<p> Some excellent comments were posted after the Charlotte Observer&rsquo;s story, on their website. Sounds like the people of North Carolina have their heads on straight   &mdash;   something I can&rsquo;t say for Cannon and Turner, and their ilk.</p>
<p> The comments agreeing with Cannon and Turner and the spineless hotel management were mostly stupid and poorly thought out. But one supporter of AmRen provided a long list of local hotels, outside the city limits and so beyond the reach of the city council, as suggested back-up locations for the conference. Mr. Taylor, I hope you read that post. Our conference can be saved yet, in spite of the malignant attempts by the politically correct crowd to wreck it!</p>

		<p>Charlotte is lost.  It is full of minorities and misplaced liberals.  Furthermore, Charlotte is about the last place I&rsquo;d choose to hold a conference.  When I attend a conference, I want something to do while out of town. What else is there, besides a NASCAR track and Carowinds?</p>

		<p>The liberals always use the concept that a business must accomodate the public, regarless of race, color, creed. It seems that Mr. Taylor is not being accomodated. </p>
<p>I hope he also looks into the conspiracy law that states that if 2 or more people attempt to violate the civil rights of another then it is a Federal crime. They used this against the K in the 60&rsquo;s. Will the use it against the commies? </p>

I&rsquo;ll bet these spinless cowards(if I may)were expecting to hear you start back pedaling and apologizing for your beliefs,try to put guilt on you for their guilty feelings, and they can&rsquo;t hide from what&rsquo;s inside of them. when people hollar racist, it&rsquo;s usually a ploy to draw attention from themself. </p>

		<p>Right now there are 550 comments on the original article, and a good number of them are clear, concise arguments espousing the views found here.  Hundreds, if not thousands of people in the Charlotte area are getting a crash course in race realism and AR&rsquo;s philosophy.  Well done, Mr. Taylor :)</p>

		<p>This craven action on the part of the Charlotte city hall should not surprise anyone; the same hysteria forced the previous convention to be cancelled as well. A better way and venue have to be found to avoid these last-minute crises and the inevitable inconvenience and disappointment of those who had registered for the meeting. I would suggest, in these circumstances, an online, subscription-only viewing of the speakers (possibly in an unannounced location) giving their presentations and answering questions from a limited audience. Questions from the viewers could be registered via e-mail or twitter and, if time permitted, answered in real time.  There are electronic means of subverting local censorship but, of course, it&rsquo;s not the same as having personal contact with those in attendance.  </p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not leave out the agent provocateurs sent by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League, FBI, BAMM (By Any Means Necessary) and every other Liberal-Nazi group out to stop free speech and create &#8216;racist&rsquo; images for the gullible, unquestioning media.</p>
<p>For example, just look at Jason Levin who founded a group called www.crashtheteaparty.org.</p>
<p>Mr. Levin and his buddies went to Tea Party rallies with misspelled signs to make Tea Party members look like idiots.</p>
<p>After he was caught, he took down the website, facebook, and twitter accounts.</p>

		<p>One one hand, this is better press than White nationalists have had for a long time.</p>
<p>On the other hand:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Taylor is editor of American Renaissance, a Virginia-based magazine of &ldquo;racial-realist thought.&rdquo; The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such groups, says the Renaissance conferences attract &ldquo;racist &lsquo;intellectuals&rsquo;&hellip; Klansmen, neo-Nazis and other white supremacists.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>We get the usual media obeisance to the SPLC, to determine the Correct party line on anything not approved by Jesse Jackson.  Though the general tone of the article is refreshingly even-handed, it seems that the editorial department still requires a quote from an SPLC handout on any matters pertaining to White self-respect.</p>
<p>Still it&rsquo;s progress, no question.<br>

<p>American Renaissance keeps track of The Southern Poverty Law Center, too. Every time the Poverty Center appears in the paper are they going to print what American Renaissance, or whatever organization that opposes them, has to say? I somehow doubt that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s going to go. There was a brief period, apparently, between the end of WWII and around 1954, where you could call folks at places like The Charlotte Observer &#8216;Communists&rsquo;, or at least some people did. Must be nice to be a leftist, and be able to participate in that kind of name calling and be thought of a hero. I suspect that&rsquo;s the whole idea&hellip;</p>

		<p>I take back my earlier comment that <i>The Charlotte Observer</i> should run an editorial supporting AR&rsquo;s right to hold this conference. It did, although it spent far more time bashing Jared Taylor than the Mayor Pro-tem for violating Taylor&rsquo;s free-speech rights. It ended with the absurd and provably false claim that &#8220;you cannot tell someone&rsquo;s race from their DNA,&#8221; while at the same time it had the nerve to insult Jared Taylor&rsquo;s intelligence!</p>
<p>With willful misinformation like this floating around, it&rsquo;s no wonder AR is having trouble getting the word out&hellip;</p>

		<p>The comments in the Charlotte papers are almost uniformly pro-Amren, and the poll at WBTV Charlotte is running 2/3 against the Sheraton.(Readers can watch video clips of Mr. Taylor at the WBTV website: http://www.wbtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=13938555  )</p>
<p>Many people have noticed, over the last year or two, this disconnect: lots of calm, logical race realism in the comments areas of even left-wing, censor-prone sites, such as NPR and, in Canada, the CBC. In Charlotte, for example, the head-line writers foam with false and hateful labels like &#8220;white supremacist,&#8221; while their readers appear much more sensible and reasonable and often, pro-white.</p>
<p>It may be a sign that the turning-point is much closer than we think, like the Soviet Union in the mid-80&rsquo;s. I can&rsquo;t see the liberal/neocon regime going down without a huge fight though, and sooner or later, Amren, or at least the great majority of its supporters, will have to stop footing around and name the main source of the enemy&rsquo;s strength. </p>
<p>For now though, it&rsquo;s great to bask in all the publicity that first Fox and the Homeland Security boobs, and now Sheraton and the Charlotte politicians, have provided.</p>

There were almost 700 comments as of 1 am. Of course, a lot of them had to be removed as anti&rsquo;s tend to become hysterical and resort to childish insults and name calling when they can&rsquo;t win an argument in a reasonable debate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before, I don&rsquo;t live that far from Charlotte and this has caused quite a buzz. Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s press conference was the lead story on one TV station, and was the poll question of the day on another. Yes, I have LOVED all the attention AmRen has gotten and hope Jared keeps up the pressure, because clearly the majority of Charlotte is on his side.</p>

		<p>I am not the least bit suprised that so many of the readers comments in the Charlotte Observer are sympathetic to American Renassaince. Native Born White Americans are running out of places to run to flee the &#8220;blessings&#8221; of diversity brought to America by high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. America is starting to feel crowded..and it is not a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>I have a very strong suspicion that many of the comments sympathetic to American are from Native Born White Americans who are transplants from areas of America that are infested with post-1965 nonwhite legal and illegal immigrants and their offspring.</p>
<p>It is absolutetly crucial for Jared to point out that post-1965 high fertility nonwhite immigrants are responsible for 100 percent of current US population growth. Toss in an amnesty, and the US population will hit the one billion mark in 25 years. You won&rsquo;t find liberals and hardcore leftists calling for a drastic increase in Native Born White fertility. Why is this? This is what Jared should be saying in his future press conferences.</p>
<p>There is an unmitigated catastrophe in the making&hellip;..a direct consequence of the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the &#8220;majority&#8221; of Charlotte. Isn&rsquo;t Charlotte 54% Black?</p>
<p>It would be a fairly safe guess to say that a good majority of white people in Charlotte, North Carolina, are on our side though. I&rsquo;ve got a feeling the &#8220;bruthas&#8221; aren&rsquo;t actually following this story or even know about what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

		<p>The first segment of the hard right that the enemy has on their &#8220;hit list&#8221; are the intellectuals, because they can influence minds. The left chooses to silence us because they cannot win in an open marketplace of ideas. All they have ever had is thuggery supported by useful idiots and psychopaths. THEY will increase the pressure and WE must increase the resistance.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;American Renaissance keeps track of The Southern Poverty Law Center, too. Every time the Poverty Center appears in the paper are they going to print what American Renaissance, or whatever organization that opposes them, has to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>I think there is a racial angle to this. The paper is being sensitive to race. On the rare occasion a pro-white group appears in the paper, a black group or &#8216;anti-hate&rsquo; group has to appear giving their say too. The effect is to reinforce the idea that people of color and their interests are more important than whites. For this newspaper, is just one more opportunity to announce this? </p>

<p>Asheville isn&rsquo;t too far from Charlotte, could still fly in to NC there and then drive to Asheville about 2 hours away.</p>

<p>Yes, you are probably correct. To be honest, I avoid Charlotte like the plauge, and go there only if absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The debate goes on at the Charlotte Observer today, ugly as ever but I&rsquo;m not surprised they haven&rsquo;t closed the article for comments. Look what it&rsquo;s doing for their readership and hits to their website! </p>

		<p>Mr. Taylor is a very brave man! What he espouses is just common sense, but it will not be perceived that way. For bleeding-heart whites &amp; ignorant blacks such as Cannon who have only their own self-serving agendas in mind, common sense doesn&rsquo;t exist. That&rsquo;s why we MUST have this valuable organization, American Renaissance! We must persevere! Thank you Jared Taylor for standing up for what is right and just! We&rsquo;ve lost too much already.</p>

		<p>&#8220;AmRen should hold the conference at the historic Grove Park Inn in Asheville, NC&#8221;</p>
<p>Asheville is known as the most liberal city in the state of North Carolina. From what I&rsquo;ve heard, it&rsquo;s more of a hippie and university town liberal than the sort of pandering in fear of blacks style liberalism that rules every large city. Just sayin, though it would be a nice place to hold a conference.</p>

<p>Nah, I&rsquo;d say that Chapel Hill, NC is more liberal than Asheville.</p>
