Abstract</p>
<p>Critiques of Whiteness Studies paradoxically focus on embodiment whether this is whiteness as an embodied identity that has realist properties or the inscription of labouring bodies through a process of racialization. In this article I consider the ways in which whiteness may be best understood as a prosthetic that can situationally be attached/detached from white bodies. Paradoxically, this flexibility of whiteness increases white people&rsquo;s powers of symbolic and material control over environments and the bodies of people of colour. In earlier work I have considered prosthetic whiteness to be mostly associated with ruling class masculinities. However, in certain contexts this ruling class discourse may become generalized. To examine how situationally this might be the case I examine survivalist and preparedness literature (&#8216;disaster education&rsquo;) that considers the racialized other to be embodied, mindless, bodies (&#8216;zombies&rsquo;) and surviving whites to be disembodied, primal, heroic agents. Using popular culture, public information films and the recent preparedness information in the UK on &#8216;swine flu&rsquo; I show how people of colour are positioned as non-agentic, static and (most significantly) as immobile and risky bodies as opposed to the portrayal of &#8216;white&rsquo; subjects in preparedness as mobile and able subjects whose genetic survival is at stake.</p>

		<p>Good deal   &mdash;   If whiteness is a &#8220;prosthesis,&#8221; this means it&rsquo;s mitigating an already existing disability.  This means that all whites are somehow &#8220;disabled,&#8221; and therefore, we can be covered by all the government protections for the &#8220;disabled.&#8221;  Many American states classify disability as grounds for hate/bias crimes, so that means any crime by a non-white against a white is automatically a hate crime.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just the goofy way these pseudo-intellectuals write.  They think it makes them appear profound, and would never consider themselves to be ridiculous, but lacking any insight into true style they are mistaken.  Besides, no one outside their small circle of &#8220;specialty&#8221; ever reads this stuff, so they are insulated from criticism.  Authentic literary style is hardly ever found within the halls of academia.  </p>

		<p>What a bunch of gobbledygook. The phrase disaster-education has a certain ring to it, though. Perhaps whiteness studies isn&rsquo;t all bad. By the way, the portrayal of others as mindless &#8216;zombies&rsquo; might well be directed at other whites hood winked by the multicult, like say the author of this piece.  </p>

		<p>What this over developed hyperbole seems to mean is that the author intends to show how &#8220;detachable whiteness&#8221; i.e. assumed white privilige (camoflaiged to deflect expected attacks), may be removed from people who are racially white, through a program of destabilization of that population and the insertion of that &#8220;prosethetic&#8221; on a non-racially white recipient. </p>
<p>The use of popular culture may mean for example, the use of a black man in the portrayal of a white archtype, as in the Brannauh &#8220;Thor&#8221; series.  The author also seems set to demonstrate that whites are typically more survival minded because they are inherently racist, where &#8220;people of colour&#8221; are not, so they tend to let things go and so are typically not ready to respond to for example, a natural disaster.  Anything to circumnavagate genetics as the cause of chronic stupidity. </p>
<p>It is new language (and far too gynastic) for repeating the now suspect old anti-white language and the drive to remove from white societies their wealth and culture and transfer it to whites through a continuation of immigration and social programs that are reducing white populations in their countries of origin as well as wherever else they have formed majority, controlling populations.  Someone who can ought to reply in kind, asserting that the surgical removal of limbs for the sake of social expiramentation constitutes a crime similar to the Nazi style medical war crimes of the 20th century.</p>

		<p>This is a shining example of the degenerated state of higher education in the West today. If this idiot didn&rsquo;t take himself seriously it could be laughed off as complete drivel.<br>
Unfortunately he takes it VERY seriously, as do many other supposedly well educated whites. How many hours of life were wasted conjuring up this convoluted, intellectualized exercise in self hate. <br>
This is why the West is losing, and will continue to disintegrate.</p>

		<p>So-called &#8220;academics&#8221; crank out gibberish on a regular basis to justify their salary, making a pretty good living at it. I can&rsquo;t help but think this article is really a hoax or a test of some sort to see what&rsquo;ll get past the attention of the other deep thinkers over there. It&rsquo;s obvious that in some of these subjects, like sociology, ethnic studies, etc, a person who is a good bull artist can sail right on through and even end up in a teaching position.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s astonishing that anyone could write as weirdly as this. Where did he come up with words like &#8220;non-agentic&#8221;?  Apparently it&rsquo;s more important to the writer to impress than to be understood. This man is a poseur, not a professor (which is still not to say that some stupidly politically correct university didn&rsquo;t give him tenure).</p>

		<p>Based on my little bit of experience in academia as an undergrad I will tell you that these professors themselves only barely know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>This is an example of language developed by &#8220;specialists&#8221; for speaking to other &#8220;specialists&#8221; in the rarefied context of the &#8220;best&#8221; schools in academia. This language only exists in written form - because obviously no one speaks this way and if they did no one, including other specialists, would understand them. And as text-only masses of jargon, they exist only to prove the worth of the author to other specialists, or to test the resolve of acolytes to try and understand them. Nobody fails of course, you get points for making a good try.</p>
<p>The upside is that a lot of this is navel gazing amongst the monks of political correctness without much consequence in the real world.</p>
<p>The bad side is that this school of theorizing produces mushy headed crusaders willing to go to great lengths in their fight against &#8220;whiteness,&#8221; &#8220;white privilege,&#8221; &#8220;Western ethnocentrism&#8221; etc. And worst of all, some of the concepts produced by this sophistry makes its way into legal and legislative battles.</p>
<p>It would be nice to see a school of push back from the traditionalists amongst us.</p>

<p>How laughable, if this fool were a student of mine, I would flunk him.</p>
<p>Currently, the entire Western white world is immobile and unable to rationally deal with multiculturalism or its needed preparedness at defending against it, for genetic survival. That is what needs to be questioned and analyzed here, not media portrayals of nonwhites as &ldquo;zombies&rdquo; and white men as over-masculine Praetorian Guards defending what is at stake.</p>

		<p>Sociologists are the most useless people on the planet.  They spend all of their time in a bubble with their peers in Universities, reading each others papers, and bloviating about &#8220;disembodied, primal, heroic agents&#8221; and &#8220;inscription of labouring bodies through a process of racialization&#8221;  This has no bearing on the real world.

		<p>&#8220;Every intellectual has a very special responsibility. He has the privilege and the opportunity of studying. In return, he owes it to his fellow men (or &ldquo;to society&rdquo;) to represent the results of his study as simply, clearly and modestly as he can. The worst thing that intellectuals can do – the cardinal sin – is to try to set themselves up as great prophets vis-à-vis their fellow men and to impress them with puzzling philosophies. Anyone who cannot speak simply and clearly should say nothing and continue to work until he can do so.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Permit me to take an amateur academic swing at this one:</p>
<p>One reason why the readers of disaster preparedness and survival-oriented books, sites, blogs, etc. are overwhelmingly white is because it&rsquo;s literally in their blood.</p>
<p>After all, white people who came out of Ice Age Europe needed to be more focused on survival and preparedness just to make it to next spring. &#8220;People of color&#8221; didn&rsquo;t have to keep warm, hunt big game, make clothes, build fires, preserve food, and plan growing seasons in the warm places they came out of. </p>
<p>Plus, white people know that the government will get around to saving them last in a disaster, if they get around to them at all.</p>
<p>On a final note, can you believe you&rsquo;re paying $200,000 for four years&rsquo; worth of stuff like this! Perhaps my kids should spring for a plumbing or welding apprenticeship instead!</p>

		<p>Oooh, ooooh, let me try!  (Makes shadow puppets in front of the projector lens).</p>
<p>Caucasian males, channeling an assumed great white hunter past out of a present disenfranchised social condition, invent a pseudo-fantasy realm which has some coproximal overlap with reality and in which a paranoid sense of &#8216;impending emergency&rsquo; allows them to &#8216;attach&rsquo; (sexuel innuendo = compensate) to a legendary white common masculine identity so as to become more than what they are as individuals: fat, lazy, past it, couch potatoes.</p>
<p>This identity thus transcending &#8216;peacetime&rsquo; cultural norms as a function of some assumed racial congruence of subconscious beliefs which they (we) do not ordinarily, overtly, share in or affect for each other (train as you fight, fight as you train) during our normally selfish, competition driven, efforts to own the most white privilege.</p>
<p>i.e.  We wish to see ourselves as become, less supermen than a band of brothers, synergized by whiteness and thus allowed to do what we are now constrained by decency from doing, using majority association of worth as justifiable belief.</p>
<p>Probably correct, insofar as it goes.  Doesn&rsquo;t explain our history, our accomplishments or the general, societal, descent into chaos after we have had power stripped away from us by the feminizing, multicult, diversicrud.</p>

		<p>I studied this stuff briefly as an undergraduate in English before switching to one of the hard sciences, so I might be able to help those confused. To understand Dr. Preston&rsquo;s article you must put it in its proper context.</p>
<p>This paper and others like it could be described as belonging to any of the several schools of thought found in today&rsquo;s liberal arts department: theory, postmodernism, deconstruction, critical race theory, etc. Though you might think the existence of so many different schools would indicate a diversity of thought going on in the universities, they are really just another name for marxism. Indeed Marxism is usually the foundation of the discipline, especially his ideas about the &#8220;base&#8221; and &#8220;superstructure&#8221; of society. </p>
<p>The base could be roughly described as the econom, the bedrock of a society. It is the means of production of that society and the relationships between the different occupations. In feudal times for example, the base of society was the manor, which was worked by serfs, smiths, freemen, and run by the lord.</p>
<p>The superstructure is basically the culture and beliefs of that society. Marx said that the superstructure is determined by whatever the base happens to be. For instance a farming society would probably have rituals dedicated to farming. Here&rsquo;s where things become relevant to the above article. Marx also believed that the superstructure reinforced the power of the people who controlled the base: the ruling class. So we believe certain things not because they are true, but because the ruling class has brainwashed us.</p>
<p>When I took an English class on &#8220;critical theory&#8221;, my class was taught that the ideas and attitudes we in the West have towards capitalism, science, religion, art, and human nature in general were dominant because white men conquered the world in the last few hundred years and it privileges them to have others accept their belief systems. Since according to marxists, the superstructure reflects the proclivities of the people in charge, they can now attack things like science as something made up whole cloth by its creators, white males, and accuse them of being another form of white oppression. Take this statement by Feminist Luce Irigaray for instance:   </p>
<p>&#8220;Is E=Mc² a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possible sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged that which goes faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this manner academics throw away with all the knowledge that  was handed to us from science, history, religion or plain common sense. Since there are no longer valid reasons for us to be capitalists, nationalists, &#8220;homophobes&#8221;, racists, or any of those nasty things, why not scrap our present society and create one that&rsquo;s more &#8220;democratic&#8221; for minorities, women, and other oppressed groups. Once you know all of this, you can watch John Preston&rsquo;s abstract transform from gibberish into something slightly intelligible before your very eyes.</p>
<p>Through our academics, the communists still have a chance to win the cold war. Sadly, many college students fall for this nonsense hook line and sinker.  </p>
<p>(Here&rsquo;s a sidenote Amreners might appreciate: One way my professor tried to prove that Hamlet&rsquo;s &#8220;To Be&#8221; soliloquy could not be the greatest moment in literature was by recounting a trip some British anthropologists took to Africa. When they put on the play for the natives, they apparently were not impressed with the prince&rsquo;s musings on suicide, but instead wanted to know more about the ghost of the king and his adventures in the spirit world. Since Africans valued the scenes with the ghost over Hamlet&rsquo;s speech, obviously our ideas about great literature are no better than any other.)   </p>

		<p>&#8220;Just imaging how crazy someone has to be to write such nonsense. Now imagine how utterly dysfunctional a school has to be to offer such drivel as a course of study. The lunatics run the asylum.&#8221;<br>
   &mdash;   AvDude </p>
<p>All true. But they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be &#8220;crazy&#8221;. This pompous, hilarious gobbledygook suggests to me a person of very limited or low IQ who has been &#8220;educated&#8221; beyond his intelligence. He has to struggle to impress and sound like what he isn&rsquo;t. He has learned all the catch phrases and  academic-speak terminology, which he spouts back like a trained parrot.  The universities are now full of them, artifically  promoted and boosted beyond their natural abilities. Anything less would be racist, you know!</p>

		<p>Well, what do you expect from the Institutionalized left? He has to do this type of intellectual gymnastics for his per-review by other leftists. His basic assumption is creative at the least. Hilarious at its best. Consider the line:</p>
<p> &#8220;Critiques of Whiteness Studies paradoxically focus on embodiment whether this is whiteness as an embodied identity that has realist properties or the inscription of labouring bodies through a process of racialization.&#8221; </p>
<p>You obviously have to speak Grad-student level hyperbole.</p>
<p>Individualism is a genetic component peculiar to Western Europeans. Google it, you may find the article. It is NOT prosthetic, the only prosthetic element of racialism is the notion of human equality as a genetic inheritance, a notion perpetuated by the socialist left, and that non-whites are the same as whites only different colors. This in itself, is denial of DIVERSITY, which directly contradicts the notion of equality by its very nature. </p>
<p>But, this is the best you can expect from the ivory tower of academia. Anything truthful would put off your per-review, and shock the plebiscite intellectual classes.<br>
