			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kirsten West Savali, Black Voices, January 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>First, the Radiance Foundation caused a media tsunami by referring to African-American children as &#8220;an endangered species,&#8221; and now a Texas-based organization is joining in the fray.</p>
<p>Heroic Media, an Austin based pro-life organization founded by heavy Republican contributor Brian Follet and supported by TLC reality star Sarah Palin, is attempting to saturate billboards from Jacksonville, Fla., to Austin, Texas, with an insulting message that blatantly labels black women menaces to society:</p>
<p>&#8220;The most dangerous place for African-American children is the womb.&#8221; According to Heroic Media, the purpose of the billboard is to draw attention to the disproportionate targeting of Planned Parenthood in minority communities:</p>
<p>&#8220;The overwhelming majority of abortion facilities are in minority neighborhoods. We think they need to know that,&#8221; said Kim Speirs, Heroic Media&rsquo;s director of communications.</p>
<p>Marissa Gabrysch, a representative from Heroic, elaborated with even more unsettling statistics:</p>
<p>&#8220;While African Americans make up 13 percent of the population in America, they represent 36 percent of the abortions in the United States. In the African-American community, twice as many deaths have occurred due to abortions than the combined totals of violent crime, cancer, heart disease and AIDS.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, black women are more than 5 times as likely as white women to have an abortion.</p>
<p>On BlackGenocide.com, Michael Novak calculates that &#8220;since the number of current living blacks (in the United States) is 36 million, the missing 16 million represents an enormous loss, for without abortion, America&rsquo;s black community would now number 52-million persons. It would be 36 percent larger than it is. Abortion has swept through the black community like a scythe, cutting down every fourth member.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While I totally reject and condemn the shock value used for the billboaord, I share Heroic Media&rsquo;s aversion to Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sanger (Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood), a devout eugenicist and Nazi supporter dedicated to &#8220;racial Aryan purification&#8221; and a society free of disabled citizens, was determined through such means as segregation, sterilization and abortion to weed out &#8220;inferior&#8221; people in society.</p>
<p>She believed organized charities implemented to prolong and enhance the lives of impoverished members of society were counter-productive to population control, so I find it no small coincidence that 62 percent to 78 percent of Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s abortion clinics are in predominately minority communities.</p>
<p>In a letter to Dr. Clarence Gamble in 1939, after African-American icon Marcus Garvey voiced his opposition to birth control, Sanger revealed her strategy:</p>
<p>&#8220;We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We don&rsquo;t want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population. And the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Civil Rights leader Erma Clardy Craven made the observation that when 17,000 aborted fetuses were found in a dumpster outside of a pathology lab in L.A., about 12,000 to 15,000 of them were African American.</p>
<p>Sanger, casting herself in the role of the black community&rsquo;s Jack Kevorkian, didn&rsquo;t murder anyone. She just strived to give us the tools to destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It appears the conservative agenda is to preserve a menial workforce for capital gain, and the liberal objective is primarily to garner votes.</p>
<p>I find both equally reprehensible.</p>

		<p>This seems like an opportune time for me to ask something&hellip;</p>
<p>Does Amren consider itself a &#8220;conservative organization&#8221; across the entire panoply of political issues, or only on its core ones.  I support the latter, but I&rsquo;m kind of a liberal on environmental protection, regulating Wall Street and sex-related issues like abortion rights.</p>
<p>To me, the importance of the black abortion rate is that it demonstrates a disconnect between their sexual behavior and birth control use.  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I don&rsquo;t really care which one they change.  It just bothers me a lot more that they don&rsquo;t connect one to the other.</p>

<p>Wow. I thought it was only three times the white rate. As for these wacky conspiracy theories that planned parenthood, et al are intentionally trying to get blacks to have more abortions, they&rsquo;re  mising something important. The black live birth-rate is still slightly higher than the white one. A much higher pregancy-rate amongst blacks is pretty much inevitable since they are  more fecund than other races and  are less likely to plan ahead and use contraception. But abortion on demand has (apparently) helped off-set this reality to a large degree. Hence, the marginally higher birth-rate when all is said and done.</p>

		<p>The book &#8220;Freakonomics&#8221; was controversial because of its assertion that abortion reduced crime because &#8220;unwantedness&#8221; turned children to crime. The conclusion was vigorously denied by pro-life activists.</p>
<p>The author, Steven Levitt, blew the theory behind the correlation by making up a new word, &#8220;unwantedness&#8221;, instead of pointing out that the aborted had a high probability of growing into criminals  &mdash;   of course that would have been career suicide, so I can&rsquo;t blame the poor chap.</p>

		<p>OUT of the womb isn&rsquo;t much safer for black children.  Absent black &#8220;baby daddies&#8221;,<br>
abusive or non-caring black mothers, peer pressure to join gangs or commit juvenile crimes, and a total lack of impulse control or social graces dooms most to poverty, prison time, or death at an early age.</p>

<p>Since they produce so many offspring that are trouble makers in so many different ways for the most part, I think it&rsquo;s a blessing for all concerned when fewer blacks add to the population.</p>
<p>I wish more black women would understand that having children carries with it responsibility and if they can&rsquo;t properly care for them they shouldn&rsquo;t have them.  Why introduce people into the population who can&rsquo;t really compete on an equal mental level and who have a third of their male population incarcerated, on probation or parole at any given time? <br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you think you have received some directive from the Lord or whomever  &mdash;  what other races do is not your concern.</p>
<p>But why are you concerned with them, anyway? Surely, this is a mystery  &mdash;  why are you concerned with the wombs of black females?  Why are you stepping into this, acting like a surrogate father?<br>
After they have the kid, where will you be then? </p>
<p>I would think it incumbent upon all surrogate fathers to provide financial support. </p>
<p>But what you are really doing is increasing OUR taxes. </p>
<p>Get a job laying bricks, building houses, mowing yards. ANYTHING where you have to sweat and break your back. </p>
<p>Perhaps that will give you a sense of reality.</p>

		<p>The real &#8220;menace to society&#8221; isn&rsquo;t black women, it&rsquo;s these right-wing, Christian nutcases with their increasingly desperate anti-abortion messages. </p>
<p>Perhaps Sarah Palin and Michael Novak have the financial resources to adopt every single black child that is born because Mama didn&rsquo;t make it to Planned Parenthood in time for her procedure? </p>
<p>Palin and Novak would be the first ones to complain about the &#8220;welfare state&#8221;, rising taxes, failing schools and fatherless homes, but yet they childlishly stand in front of abortion clinics and put up these lousy billboards in order to curtail black women from visiting the clinic. Can they not see what a contradictory ideology they serve? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of these self-loathing white conservatives and their guilt trips over the black abortion rate. Either put up or shut up! </p>

Wow!   Even if those hysterical allegations against Margaret Sanger were true, the dense writer of this article fails to see that her program would only benefit his people, leaving it stronger and relieved of its incompetents, morons, and misfits  (of &#8220;inferior&#8221; people, as he says).  Are those the society he wishes to have? </p>

		<p>Hmm, it takes a lot of effort to remember to buy condoms, and steely self-control to stop and put one on before coitus. Self-control and future planning are among the weakest traits that blacks have, and Planned Parenthood knows this. They know who needs abortions, and open clinics accordingly.</p>

		<p>I saw an advertisement on BET about how abortion kills more blacks than black on black homicide  .If blacks bred as fast as they did before the 1970s, then they would be far more numerous than they are now.  Their sheer numbers have gone up 50% since then.  They are in NO danger of becoming extinct in this country, or of going down in terms of percentages.  They constantly whine about how whitey wants them them just disappear.  They wish the same thing for us. Lets us get real, and admit that we really dont like each other.</p>

		<p>Actually, this is false. My neighbor who is a retired physician workied in an abotion clinic for 20 years and told me that White females were 7 times more liley to get an abortion than Black  women. In fact, upper income women of all races are more likely to get abortion as opposed to poor women of all races. </p>

		<p>No one will admit to thinking or feeling this, but at bottom many people want the black population to shrink, if not absent itself entirely from the nation. No, they don&rsquo;t want to resort to immoral means––who does?––but if, say, everyone woke up tomorrow and found all the blacks gone, what do you think the majority reaction would be? Honestly? &#8220;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll have a Coke then,&#8221; more likely than not.</p>
<p>At bottom, most blacks must know this on some level. Hence the awful paranoia that comes from knowing one is neither wanted nor needed, even by one&rsquo;s kin. I doubt that intelligent, well-to-do blacks look upon their brethren, who sire 8 or 10 or 15 children at taxpayer&rsquo;s expense, with warmth.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s much easier to shove these uncomfortable thoughts into thee dark places of the mind, far away from where consciousness can reach them, and let your hands work without the mind&rsquo;s knowing what they do. Most people, I&rsquo;d guess, do this with some issue or another; why not race? Hence the disparate impact hysteria; it shines a too-bright light into forbidden rooms, threatening to reveal their contents out into the open. Heaven forfend!</p>
<p>Too, anyone with any brains can see that some people shouldn&rsquo;t have children, but saying this contravenes some inchoate idea of what the Declaration of Independence says, &#8220;all men created equal&#8221; and all that. Plus, of course, disparate impact.</p>
<p>Re: the Sanger quotes. I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing their source. If she really supported &#8220;racial Aryan purification,&#8221; does that invalidate all of her other beliefs? And––to be honest again––even if they don&rsquo;t want the responsibility, how many liberals would be truly aggrieved by a policy of reducing the black population, especially the most violent and least intelligent members of that group? How many would merely affect outrage to keep their jobs?</p>

		<p>I am deeply devided on this issue.  On the one hand, I am against abortion, it is a horrible practice that must stop.  On the other hand if there were no abortions in the African community, there would be millions of children born to &#8220;children&#8221; who could not care for them.  Subsequently, those impoverished children would would have little recoarse except to turn to criminal behavior.  A better solution would be to prevent teen pregnancy by returning schools to a moral based curiculum that encourages abstenance from pre maritial sex.  </p>

		<p>High abortion rates notwithstanding, American blacks are by no means an endangered species.  In contrast to whites, who are decreasing as a percentage of the population every year, blacks are gradually increasing their percentage of the population.  They were 10% of the population in the 1960s, are 13% now, and black children are 15% of the child population, so blacks will eventually be 15% of the population.</p>
<p>If black abortion rates are lowered by restricting abortion we&rsquo;ll see even more black children growing up in mother-only (or grandmother-only) households.  The right way to lower black abortion rates would be for more black women to get married before they spread their legs and get pregnant.  Fat chance of that happening.<br>

		<p>As a devout Christian and biology major graduate from college; there is no gray area about sexual reproductive off spring, they are genetically the specie that their parents are although possibly quite different looking for example: a maggot from its parnet, the fly.Therefore any human abortion is murder of the innocent. Black women should have the same morality as other races to limit pregnancy from marriage only, with a husband who earns a moral living wage. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!

		<p>Do blacks think they would be better off without all those voluntary abortions? There would be much more crime, especially in the black communities, more illegitimacy with its resultant social pathology including academic failure, and inevitably a much increased drain on the economy from increased welfare, incarceration and taxpayer supported health care. Better to have millions of black teenage girls with two &amp; three dependent kids? <br>

		<p>The U.S. prison population has grown dramatically since 1980. From 1980 to 1990 there was a slight decline in the crime rate. Since 1990 there has been a more significant decline, that has continued during the Great Recession.<br>
 <br>
In Freakonomics Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt argue that the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973 is the main factor in the decline in the crime rate since 1990.  They point out that the females most likely to have abortions are poor, poorly educated, have few prospects in life, and are unmarried. These are also the females who are most likely to give birth to violent street criminals.</p>

		<p>Sadly, the most dangerous place for ANY child is in the womb.</p>
<p>Abortion may seem like an easy way out of an unplanned pregnancy, but it&rsquo;s hateful, selfish and cowardly.</p>
<p>One measure of who we are as a species lies in our ability to find better solutions than this to our problems. I can&rsquo;t halp but think that the increase in violence and just plain brutality that characterizes modern American society comes from the wholesale legalization of abortion.</p>

		<p>You know, I am 100% anti-abortion.  Yes, the likelihood is high that black children will grow up to become criminals&hellip;but I don&rsquo;t believe in punishing someone who hasn&rsquo;t committed a crime.</p>
<p>I know some people who claim to be pro-life are okay with blacks aborting their children&hellip;which begs the question, should they be arrested for abusing and murdering the children that were already born?  After all, one black child killed is one less on welfare or in jail later on, right?</p>
<p>All the more reason why blacks should be in their own nations.  They can have their culture (such that it is) and leave civilized people alone.  I am against genocide of any race.</p>

		<p>I think the article and billboard are misleading.  Maybe the middle class black woman is more likely to have an abortion than a white women in general but when it comes to the black underclass of which 70%+ of the black population belongs, I bet the rate is less than what the white rate is.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t buy it.  All I see anymore is more and more black faces, and less and less white faces.  And, the black underclass is just too lazy and ignorant to get abortions.  Doesn&rsquo;t The State pay them more for each additional head?  How is that an incentive for abortion?  Perhaps the black abortion rate would increase if The State had a free service with a mobile unit that goes to them.  Being &#8220;free&#8221; isn&rsquo;t the only carrot you need nowadays.<br>

		<p> Margaret Sanger was no Nazi supporter. That statement is a misleading canard. She was an ardent Women&rsquo;s rights advocate and eugenics supporter. In her Plan for Peace (1932) she wrote: &#8220;Apply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring&#8221; Margaret Sanger was a race realist because of her beliefs about the inheritability of human traits. </p>

&#8220;No one will admit to thinking or feeling this, but at bottom many people want the black population to shrink, if not absent itself entirely from the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;&hellip;&hellip;.to be honest again––even if they don&rsquo;t want the responsibility, how many liberals would be truly aggrieved by a policy of reducing the black population, especially the most violent and least intelligent members of that group? How many would merely affect outrage to keep their jobs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe they feel that way, because they&rsquo;re aware, way down deep, their hare-brained proposals only encourage black pathologies of which there are a lot, the most egregious being their lack of intelligence and their lack of impulse control, and their high propensity for crime and violence.  Why would anyone but a fool not desire the reduction of, &#8220;especially the most violent and least intelligent members of that group,&#8221; as you stated?</p>
<p>That you would think that people who desire fewer blacks in the population is somehow unfavorable sounds to be based in total ignorance or an inability to understand anything about blacks.</p>
<p>Without a doubt you&rsquo;re anti-Christian&hellip;.and you don&rsquo;t make a lot of sense either.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed the comment comparing vaccination to genocide.  Whites vaccinate their own kids, but it&rsquo;s &#8220;genocide&#8221; if we vaccinate black kids?  And then there was the allegation that condoms sold in the black neighborhoods are 15 percent less effective than condoms sold in the white community&hellip;no wonder they think AIDS is a conspiracy.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that the posters on that board are the &#8220;educated&#8221; blacks, since functional-illiterates don&rsquo;t post on news sites.  The conspiracy theories parroted by blacks are unbelievably juvenile.  It would be funny if it wasn&rsquo;t a burden on the rest of the country.  </p>

		<p>In addition to higher birth rates than whites, the federal government has seen fit to inundate this country with black criminals from Somalia, Haiti, Jamaica and numerous parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Is it not madness to add to the general population people who have a history and propensity for murder, violence and crime, and must be given welfare to survive, because they can&rsquo;t compete and will never be able to?</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t this policy increase the chances this empire will implode, especially during hard economic times?</p>
<p>Is this all being done under some misguided idea that a fractious population of tribes is necessary in order to reduce the white power structure which is hated so much by rabid ideologues who believe whites, especially Anglos, are the reason for all the world&rsquo;s ills?</p>
<p>Or is it being done in an attempt to destroy this country completely?  Certainly that&rsquo;s probably the most logical reason, since forces behind it all would be pretty stupid not to realize that their third world inundation policies would more effectively destroy this country than a military attack from outside.</p>
<p>Has anybody noticed that economic catastrophe and breakup are common topics of discussion on a plethora of news sites now, when such things were rarely mentioned before?</p>
<p>Has anybody noticed that we are entering a period of increasingly high food and energy prices, while joblessness is still high and people have less money, and that the national debt and more quantatative easing is causing inflation to zoom upward, with every indication it will continue to do so? </p>
<p>Compared to the existing situation is the black birth rate really significant now or in the foreseeable future? </p>
<p>It is the urban centers that will undergo the greatest upheaval, even if&hellip;for some strange reason&hellip;the empire doesn&rsquo;t eventually shatter.   </p>

		<p>The most dangerous place for black children is the womb, but not just from abortion. Its bloody hard to get a lot of black women to stop drinking during pregnancy, to stop smoking during pregnancy, to eat right, to get off of heroin, cocaine, and other drugs. </p>
<p>My fiance treats drug addicts at an inpatient, state funded facility. Most of the black patients there are court referrals. The number of black women there who have lost more than 2 children to social services because they can not, or will not control their drug habit during, and after pregnancy is well over 60%. I couldn&rsquo;t tell you the number that have had an abortion, but I&rsquo;ve heard plenty of stories from her about clients that have had more than 5 abortions. One of her clients had been pregnant 13 times, had more than 5 abortions, several miscarriages, and had lost all the kids that had come to term due to her continues drinking, and drug use. </p>
<p>I despise abortion, but I also despise kids being shuffled through orphanages, foster care, and the general malaise of social services that turn out highly dysfunctional adults. A fair number of those kids escape the foster system by being adopted by grand parents, and the figures for blacks leading adoption come from the high numbers of black women that are on drugs, or facing lengthy incarcerations where the family steps in to take the children. I also despise DCSE, and DSS for making it difficult for the fathers of these children to gain full custody of them when the mother is a real piece of work. They have financial incentives to keep the kids in a limbo state, as do many of the unfit mothers.  </p>
<p>Many of these kids were damaged before they escaped the womb, and that damage is often permanent. Worse still, the children of drug addicts tend to be more likely to end up abusing drugs, and having their children taken away as well. All of this because their mothers couldn&rsquo;t put down the crack pipe, stay off the needle, put down the malt liquor, and stop stealing, and turning tricks to support their habits. As much as it goes against my beliefs to say it: A large number of these kids wont have a chance period, even if abortion were outlawed. </p>

I also strongly encourage white woman to never have abortions and to place these children up for adoption. Done properly, this can be our secret weapon.</p>

<p>Instead of killing innocent fetuses stop the blacks ( and other poor) from reproducing so much by making it harder to get government assistance unless you have been sterilized or have some implantable birth control or some injectable birth control.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Actually, this is false. My neighbor who is a retired physician workied in an abotion clinic for 20 years and told me that White females were 7 times more liley to get an abortion than Black women. In fact, upper income women of all races are more likely to get abortion as opposed to poor women of all races.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did your neighbor ever look at these statistics?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5713a1.htm?s_cid=ss5713a1_e" rel="nofollow">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5713a1.htm?s_cid=ss5713a1_e</a></p>
<p>&#8220;In the 38 reporting areas for which race was provided, classified according to the same categories used in previous years, approximately 53% of women who obtained legal induced abortions were known to be white; 35%, black; and 8% other; for 4%, race was not known (Table 9). The abortion ratio for black women (467 per 1,000 live births) was 2.9 times the ratio for white women (158 per 1,000), and the ratio for women of the heterogeneous &#8220;other&#8221; race category (319 per 1,000) was 2.0 times the ratio for white women. The abortion rate for black women (28 per 1,000 women) was 3.1 times the rate for white women (nine per 1,000), whereas the abortion rate for women of other races (18 per 1,000 women) was 2.0 times the rate for white women.&#8221;</p>

<p>You surely aren&rsquo;t the only one.  I regularly write to my leftist elected officials in Congress demanding they repeal the Hyde Amendment (which put restrictions on Federal funding for abortions).  I also write to my state officials (I live in New York) demanding they increase funding for abortion clinics in areas with large non-White populations to help all those poor, deprived women.</p>

		<p>MORE THAN HALF OF ALL PREGNANCIES ARE UNPLANNED PEOPLE.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Nearly half of pregnancies among American women are unintended, and four in 10 of these are terminated by abortion.[1] Twenty-two percent of all pregnancies (excluding miscarriages) end in abortion.[2]<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/dmAFD</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s white, black, hispanic and asian.  Indeed, the number of women who will have had an abortion by 45-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
At least half of American women will experience an unintended pregnancy by age 45[4], and, at current rates, about one-third will have had an abortion.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>And where-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Women who have never married and are not cohabiting account for 45% of all abortions.[6]</p>
<p>About 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>You cannot honestly say that &#8216;loose women&rsquo; are responsible for more baby killings than properly married ladies.</p>
<p>Only about-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Eighteen percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are teenagers; those aged 15-17 obtain 6% of all abortions, teens aged 18-19 obtain 11%, and teens under age 15 obtain 0.4%. [6]</p>
<p>Women in their twenties account for more than half of all abortions; women aged 20–24 obtain 33% of all abortions, and women aged 25-29 obtain 24%<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>So what you are seeing is the direct consequences of **feminism** and the desire for independent social class status causing women to avert or subjugate a natural instinctive urge to a later point in life when the availability of suitable males and indeed their own fertility is significantly at risk.</p>
<p>This is why white women are not breeding the requisite THREE TIME necessary to sustain our own population and a lot of that has to do with 10-15% &#8216;leader group&rsquo; who, by no longer getting knocked up in their teens, don&rsquo;t initiation a tipping point cue to other young women and boys to also breed while young.</p>
<p>Blacks in particular get by this by having a 20% higher testosterone level in both males and females.  Their sex urge is so damn high they can&rsquo;t stop themselves.</p>
<p>And what is the consequence of that?</p>
<p>Well, this is what you are looking at for _just delivery_ of an uninsured child-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2005 45.8 million Americans do not have health insurance. If this figure includes you, you can anticipate an average hospital bill of $5,000-$10,000 for a vaginal delivery. Add at least $2,000 if you need a c-section. These figures do not include the medical costs associated with nine months of prenatal visits, ultrasound costs and other lab costs. If your baby is born premature or with health problems, neonatal costs can range from a few thousand for a short stay to more than $200,000 if you baby is born more than 15 weeks early. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/3ynUc</p>
<p>This is the average cost of an abortion-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
In general, though, women getting an abortion between six and ten weeks&rsquo; gestation can expect to pay about $350 at an abortion clinic and $500 at a physician&rsquo;s office. Providing abortions later in pregnancy is somewhat more complicated, and is usually more expensive. For example, at 16 weeks gestation, abortion clinics generally charge around $650 and physicians&rsquo; offices generally charge around $700. After the 20th week, the cost rises to above $1,000.2<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/Qq65f</p>
<p>This is Norplant-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Norplant is a long-term method of birth control consisting of six thin, flexible plastic tubes the size of matchsticks. These flexible tubes allow the release of the synthetic hormone progestin, which acts to prevent pregnancy. The tubes are inserted into the upper arm after the area is numbed with a local anesthetic. A small incision is made, and the six Norplant capsules are inserted.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Norplant protects against pregnancy for five years; however, it does not protect against HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. Norplant must be removed after five years of use. It can also be removed at any point before five years.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Norplant is an extremely effective contraceptive: it is 99.9 percent effective at preventing pregnancy. Of every 10,000 women who use Norplant for five years, fewer than five will become pregnant.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Without public or private insurance coverage, Norplant can cost between $500 and $750 for the medical exam, a pregnancy test, the implant, and the insertion. This amounts to $100 to $150 per year over a five-year period. Clinicians will charge an additional fee to remove Norplant   &mdash;   from $100 to $200. Some insurance plans will pay for Norplant. Medicaid covers the cost of the drug for all eligible women living in any of the 50 states.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/2JjyU</p>
<p>Guess what will happen when blacks have &#8216;free delivery&rsquo; like frickin&rsquo; Dominos Pizza as a part of an undeniable health care coverage plan?  Population Explosion.</p>
<p>Better, economically, for those populations both hispanic and black, with licentious and early sexualization, to be signed up for FREE birth control.</p>
<p>Than to endure this endless &#8216;Home Alone&rsquo; idiocy over &#8220;Oh No!  It&rsquo;s a person!&#8221; abortion aversion.  I swear, it&rsquo;s like herding cats, everyone is so damn attached to their emotional outlook that they simply don&rsquo;t -think things through- in terms of consequences and alternatives.</p>
<p>And speaking of morons, Margarent Sanger?  100% correct.  4% of today&rsquo;s population, as genetic cripples either mentally, physically or both, will have 33% of tomorrows disabled children.</p>
<p>Sterilize them.</p>
<p>Similarly, if someone _just can&rsquo;t make it_ in today&rsquo;s society because they lack the will or the brains, don&rsquo;t make a big deal about putting them on life long dole in paid-for housing.  </p>
<p>Simply make sure THEY DO NOT BREED FAILURE.</p>
<p>We are going to have to suck it up and realize that Eugenics, whether &#8216;Nazi&rsquo; or otherwise, is largely correct in it&rsquo;s concepts.  And has been for the dozen centuries or more that farmers have been practicing it to breed stronger, healthier, animals.</p>
<p>Humans are animals.  All of us.  Until we deal with biologic realities of that, we will never be able to stabilize our racial decline behind stern laws requiring proper reproduction and defend our genes from invasive, destructive, hybridization attempts.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;but I don&rsquo;t believe in punishing someone who hasn&rsquo;t committed a crime.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I am also against punishing someone who hasn&rsquo;t committed a crime. But I am fully in favor of preventing crime.</p>
<p>Since I am in favor of crime prevention, I am in favor of abortion (of those most likely to commit crime).</p>
<p>It is much better to PREVENT crime, than to PUNISH it.<br>
(And cheaper too.)</p>
<p>Or, as my grandmother used to say, &#8220;A stitch in time saves nine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where you have punishment, you already have a crime and a victim.<br>
Where you have prevention, there is NO crime and NO victim.</p>
<p>Now, which would any rational person choose?</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p><i>Sanger (Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood), a devout eugenicist and Nazi supporter dedicated to &#8216;racial Aryan purification&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>No source for this info, of course.  It&rsquo;s in <i>black voices</i> so any White that deigns to question it will certainly be silenced by screams of  Racist! Nazi! and Hater!</p>
<p>As for Margaret Sanger, I could find no proof that she supported Nazis or dedicated herself to <i>racial Aryan purity</i> but she was so anti-Catholic that she threatened to leave the country if Jack Kennedy were elected president.</p>
<p>Margaret Sanger writes in her book, <i>The Pivot of Civilization (1922):</i></p>
<p><i>The most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective. Possibly drastic and Spartan methods may be forced upon American society if it continues complacently to encourage the chance and chaotic breeding that has resulted from our stupid, cruel sentimentalism.</i></p>
<p>Dr. Jack Cashill, Professor, Hoosier and Boilermaker <i>extraordinaire</i> reports in his wonderful book <i>Hoodwinked:</i></p>
<p><i>[Margaret Sanger] reserves her greatest scorn, of course, for the traditional. The Catholic Church&rsquo;s claim that even deformed children have souls&hellip;&rsquo;Organized charity,&rsquo; writes Sanger, &#8216;itself is the symptom of a malignant social disease.&rsquo; By keeping so many &#8216;defectives, delinquents and dependents&rsquo; alive and breeding, charity at some point becomes an injustice for self-supporting citizen</i> </p>

<p>The author of the article did get one thing right:  <i>It appears the conservative agenda is to preserve a menial workforce for capital gain, and the liberal objective is primarily to garner votes.</i></p>
<p>But, I doubt she understand that both of these goals converge, much to the detriment of ALL US citizens, black and White.</p>

		<p>The pro-life movement has recently become obsessed with this idea that &#8216;abortion is racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The last pro-life event I went to was 95% whites spending the whole time crying about &#8216;racist&rsquo; abortion against blacks and hispanics. Between speakers there were chants of &#8216;stop black genocide&rsquo; and pro-vida!&rsquo;. </p>
<p>I asked one speaker why we should put so much emphasis on minority abortions. Are minority abortions worse than white abortions? </p>
<p>He answered Jesus wants us to help the oppressed and blacks and hispanics are &#8216;oppressed&rsquo; in this country so it is our duty to do our utmost to help them. </p>
<p>That was the last straw for me. I have since washed my hands of the increasingly ridiculous and left-wing pro-life movement.<br>
