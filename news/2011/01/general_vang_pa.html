			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John-Thomas Kobos, KFSN-TV (Fresno), January 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Funeral plans for General Vang Pao, the leader of hundreds of thousands of Hmong, are underway. Family members are describing it as a &#8216;Funeral fit for a King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The funeral will be held on February 4th at the Fresno Convention Center. Standard Hmong funeral lasts four days, but because his father was so influential and important this funeral will go on for six days.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vang said the Fresno Convention Center will have to accomodate 15-20,000 people a day. Stories of the General growing up will be told as well as how he helped American soldiers during the Vietnam war and why his mission in life was to liberate his people from Laotian persecution.</p>
<p>Vang: &#8220;So many parts it&rsquo;s overwhelming. No one can really comprehend what&rsquo;s going to be done because it&rsquo;s never been done .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fit for a King.&#8221;</p>
<p>His role as leader did come with challenges later in life. U.S. prosecutors accused the General of plotting to overthrow his former government.</p>
<p>In 2009 charges were dropped against the General for lack of evidence. However twelve of his close friends and former officers were left facing those charges. Monday afternoon the federal prosecutor in the case dropped the charges for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&rsquo;d be very pleased to know. He and I discussed that on a number of occasion,&#8221; said Valley congressman Jim Costa (D).</p>
<p>Costa [Rep. Jim Costa, D] is seeking a waiver on behalf of the General&rsquo;s family to bury the Hmong leader at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>

		<p>Is Rep. Costa insane? Why should a Laotian Hmong national be buried in Arlington cemetery, next to American presidents and soldiers? The man might have helped American troops in the Vietnam War, but that hardly qualifies him for burial at Arlington.</p>
<p>Costa is just grandstanding among his Hmong constituents in his congressional district.</p>

		<p>Chai Vang is General Vang Pao&rsquo;s son. In 2004, Chai Vang murdered 6 people in Wisconsin. </p>

		<p>I am sickened by the thought of a state funeral for a foreigner.  If he deserves a state funeral let Laos hold it Laos.  And this Rep. Costa is shameful in trying to get this man buried in Arlington.  My country is dead and gone.  Over.  </p>

		<p>One more legacy of America&rsquo;s foolish intervention in Vietnam. Forty years from now we will probably have a similar scene for some Afghan warlord or Iraqi tribal leader. Lets stop invading countries around the world, bring the troops home, seal the border and call it a draw. </p>

		<p>Having worked extensively with montagnard tribesmen during my two tours in Vietnam, I have no problem seeing one of them being buried in Arlington.  The &#8216;yards were loyal allies (are were many South Vietnamese) who were abandoned to their fate when we pulled out in 1975, after, by the way, winning the war.</p>
<p>Our abandonment of South Vietnam by the Democrats was certainly the most vicious and criminal act of political vituperation in our history, perhaps in all history.  A hard won victory was literally thrown away, just to allow the Democrat Party to prove that they were right all along in a war, incidentally, started by a Democrat.</p>
<p>Allowing a few of our Vietnam allies to be buried in Arlington would seem appropriate in view of their abandonment.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Model minority?&#8221;  More like typical non-white.  Vang Pao is Hmong, fought for the Hmong and was a member of the Royal Lao Army yet wants to be buried in America&rsquo;s national cemetery.  They rather invade white people&rsquo;s space after white people did all the work then create their own stuff.</p>
<p>Fred, I remember that.  All six victims were white.  He got angry when he was told to leave their private property and shot them in the back.  William of Rubruck got it right many centuries ago when he observed East Asians, &#8220;They esteem themselves lords and think that nothing should be denied them by any man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The war in Vietnam was a disaster for America and we most certainly did not &#8220;win&#8221; it. 58,000 Americans died John. Should we still have had our troops there today? This is what happens when you invade the world John.</p>
<p>I also remember that hunting murderer of six White Americans in Wisconsin. The MSM tried to present the Asian trespasser as some kind of &#8220;victim&#8221; of &#8220;racism&#8221;. It was bogus then and it is bogus now. This is what happens when you invite the world John.</p>

		<p>Not all the Meo / Hmong were mercenaries in the service of the French / C.I.A.; there were plenty of Meo / Hmong clans who fought on the side of the Pathet Lao, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Meo / Hmong were, in short, as bitterly divided as were most ethno-cultural groups in Indochina.</p>
<p>These days, all those who skedaddled to France and the U.S.A. - for their own great good* - are welcome to come back and spend or invest their Euros and dollars, unless they are notorious and likely to be arrested on sight.</p>
<p>It is necessary to point out that the Meo / Hmong are not greatly esteemed, except as warriors, in the countries in which they are resident.</p>
<p>* Some of the Royalsi / Neutralist Laotians were gullible enough to place their trust in the good faith of the Pathet Lao in 1975 and did not flee to Thailand and further afield. A few hundred were summarily murdered, many others - like the owner of a guest house on the island of Don Khon in the Mekong - were obliged to work in labor gangs in the East and North, repairing the roads and bridges destroyed by B-52 bombing.</p>

<p>Thanks for giving us the aracial, neo-colonialist and patriotarded view of things.  You&rsquo;re a text book example of how an over developed sense of idealism hurts our race&rsquo;s ability to survive.  </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t owe anything to the Hmong or to anyone else but our own people.  Our people&rsquo;s survival and advancement are the highest values.  Anything that is good for our people is good and anything that is bad for our people is bad.  That&rsquo;s the moral code that all other groups on Earth operate by, from the Hmong to the Jews to the Chinese to whoever.  We are the only ones who find ways to see things that hurt our people   &mdash;   like importing Hmong   &mdash;   as somehow good.  </p>
