	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Urban teachers face an intractable problem, one that we cannot spend or even teach our way out of: teen pregnancy. This year, all of my favorite girls are pregnant, four in all, future unwed mothers every one. There will be no innovation in this quarter, no race to the top. Personal moral accountability is the electrified rail that no politician wants to touch.</p>
<p>My first encounter with teen pregnancy was a girl named Nicole, a pretty 15-year-old who had rings on every finger and great looped earrings and a red pen with fluffy pink feathers and a heart that lit up when she wrote with it. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Nicole&rsquo;s grades started to improve. Encouraged, I hectored and cajoled and praised her every small effort. She was an innately bright girl who might, if I dragged her by the heels, eventually survive the rigors of a community college.</p>
<p>Then one morning, her head dropped again. I rapped my knuckles on her desk. &#8220;Leave me alone, mister,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I feel sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sly exchange of looks among the other girls in class, a giggle or two, and then one of them said: &#8220;She&rsquo;s pregnant, Mr. Garibaldi.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Within my lifetime, single parenthood has been transformed from shame to saintliness. In our society, perversely, we celebrate the unwed mother as a heroic figure, like a fireman or a police officer. During the last presidential election, much was made of Obama&rsquo;s mother, who was a single parent. Movie stars and pop singers flaunt their daddy-less babies like fishing trophies.</p>
<p>None of this is lost on my students. In today&rsquo;s urban high school, there is no shame or social ostracism when girls become pregnant. Other girls in school want to pat their stomachs. Their friends throw baby showers at which meager little gifts are given. After delivery, the girls return to school with baby pictures on their cell phones or slipped into their binders, which they eagerly share with me. Often they sit together in my classes, sharing insights into parenting, discussing the taste of Pedialite or the exhaustion that goes with the job. On my way home at night, I often see my students in the projects that surround our school, pushing their strollers or hanging out on their stoops instead of doing their homework.</p>
<p>Connecticut is among the most generous of the states to out-of-wedlock mothers. Teenage girls like Nicole qualify for a vast array of welfare benefits from the state and federal governments: medical coverage when they become pregnant (called &#8220;Healthy Start&#8221;); later, medical insurance for the family (&#8220;Husky&#8221;); child care (&#8220;Care 4 Kids&#8221;); Section 8 housing subsidies; the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; cash assistance. If you need to get to an appointment, state-sponsored dial-a-ride is available. If that appointment is college-related, no sweat: education grants for single mothers are available, too. Nicole didn&rsquo;t have to worry about finishing the school year; the state sent a $35-an-hour tutor directly to her home halfway into her final trimester and for six weeks after the baby arrived.</p>
<p>In theory, this provision of services is humane and defensible, an essential safety net for the most vulnerable  &mdash;  children who have children. What it amounts to in practice is a monolithic public endorsement of single motherhood  &mdash;  one that has turned our urban high schools into puppy mills. The safety net has become a hammock.</p>
<p>The young father almost always greets the pregnancy with adolescent excitement, as if a baby were a new Xbox game. In Nicole&rsquo;s case, the father&rsquo;s name was David. David manfully walked Nicole to class each morning and gave her a kiss at the door. I had him in homeroom and asked if he planned to marry her. &#8220;No&#8221; was his frank answer. But he did have plans to help out. David himself lived with his mother. His dad had served a short sentence in prison for drug possession and ran a motorcycle-repair shop somewhere upstate. One afternoon, David proudly opened his father&rsquo;s website to show me the customized motorcycles he built. There he was, the spit and image of his son, smiling atop a gleaming vintage Harley, not a care in the world.</p>
<p>Boys without fathers, like David, cultivate an overweening bravado to overcome a deeper sense of vulnerability and male confusion. They strut, swear, and swagger. There&rsquo;s a he-man thing to getting a girl pregnant that marks you as an adult in the eyes of your equally unmoored peers. But a boy&rsquo;s interest in his child quickly vanishes. When I ask girls if the father is helping out with the baby, they shrug. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care if he does or not,&#8221; I&rsquo;ve heard too often.</p>
<p>As for girls without fathers, they are often among my most disruptive students. You walk on eggshells with them. You broker remarks, you negotiate insults, all the while trying to pull them along on a slender thread. Their anger toward male authority can be lacerating. They view trips to the principal&rsquo;s office like victory laps.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody gets married any more, mister,&#8221; Shanice and Maria chime in. &#8220;You&rsquo;re just picking on us because we have kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point, my &#8220;picking&#8221; has only just begun. It&rsquo;s partly for their benefit, but mostly for the other girls in the room, who haven&rsquo;t said a word. As much as Nicole is aware of her mother&rsquo;s sacrifices, she is equally proud of her mother&rsquo;s choice to keep her. It&rsquo;s locked away in her heart like a cameo. They&rsquo;re best friends, she offers. The talk turns to her mother&rsquo;s loyalty and love, and soon the class rises in a choir to mom&rsquo;s defense.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As do most of my 11th-graders, Nicole reads at a fifth-grade level, which means I must peruse the articles and statistics along with her, side by side. She groans each time I pick out a long article and counts the number of pages before she reads. With my persistent nudging, she and Maria begin to pull out the statistics for the children of single parents. From the FBI: 63 percent of all suicides are individuals from single-parent households. From the Centers for Disease Control: 75 percent of adolescents in chemical-dependency hospitals come from single-parent households. From the Children&rsquo;s Defense Fund: more than half of all youths incarcerated for criminal acts come from single-parent households. And so on.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nicole failed both my classes, which meant summer school. When she returned the following year, she was in good spirits. The birth of her son had gone well. She had a heart-adorned album full of photos of her boy. Things were settled, she said. She was going to work hard this year; she felt motivated, even eager. And by year&rsquo;s end, her reading level had indeed risen nearly two grades  &mdash;  but it was still far below what she would need to score as proficient on the Connecticut Academic Performance Test, one of the yardsticks for accountability in Title I schools.</p>
<p>The path for young, unwed mothers  &mdash;  and for their children  &mdash;  can be brutal. Consider how often girls get molested in their own homes after Mom has decided to let her boyfriend move in. The boyfriend splits the rent and the food bill, but he often sees his girlfriend&rsquo;s teenage daughter as fair game. Teachers whisper their suspicions in the lunchroom or in the hallways when they notice that one of their students has become suddenly emotional, that her grades have inexplicably dropped, or that she stays late after school to hang out in her teacher&rsquo;s classroom or begins sleeping over at a friend&rsquo;s house several nights a week. Sometimes she simply disappears.</p>
<p>And there are other dangers. I once had a student named Jasmine, who had given birth over the summer. She did just enough to earn Ds in my class. One day, I observed her staring off mulishly into space for nearly the entire period, not hearing a word I said and ignoring her assignment. At the end of class, I took her aside and asked, with some irritation, what the matter was.</p>
<p>Her eyes welled with tears. &#8220;I gave my son to his father to look after yesterday. When I picked him up, he had bruises on his head and a cut.&#8221; Her son was six months old.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Every fall, new education theories arrive, born like orchids in the hothouses of big-time university education departments. Urban teachers are always first in line for each new bloom. We&rsquo;ve been retrofitted as teachers a dozen times over. This year&rsquo;s innovation is the Data Wall, a strategy in which teachers must test endlessly in order to produce data about students&rsquo; progress. The Obama administration has spent lavishly to ensure that professional consultants monitor its implementation.</p>
<p>Every year, the national statistics summon a fresh chorus of outrage at the failure of urban public schools. Next year, I fear, will be little different.<br>

		<p><i>As do most of my 11th-graders, Nicole reads at a fifth-grade level&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Which makes me wonder:  Why were they promoted past the 5th grade in the first place?  Do you ever hear of someone in the 11th grade actually having an 11th grade reading level?  The context of the above statement about &#8220;Nicole&#8221; was the occasion of her being in this teacher&rsquo;s journalism class.  How does one expect a high school junior not being able to read even at middle school level to be a journalist?</p>
<p><i>Consider how often girls get molested in their own homes after Mom has decided to let her boyfriend move in. The boyfriend splits the rent and the food bill, but he often sees his girlfriend&rsquo;s teenage daughter as fair game.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the girls.  The mother&rsquo;s new boyfriend often throws out the mother&rsquo;s adolescent sons, or rather, he pressures the mother to evict the son.  It is eerily similar to the way new male lions that take over a pride of females drive away the adolescent or young adult males of the existing females of the pride.  They don&rsquo;t want competition for pride/household leadership.</p>
<p>It happens so often in the black sections of major cities that some school districts in St. Louis have sponsored special homes for such evicted young men who are students in the district.</p>

		<p>Pay for bad behavior and you&rsquo;ll get more of it.  Praise bad behavior and you get more of it.  The only public assistance available should be to those who are handicapped, orphaned or elderly.  Getting pregnant out of wedlock should not mean a meal ticket.  If you can not feed your baby yourself give it up but do not expect me to feed it.  The only assistance I would provide unwed mothers and their illegitimate children would be assistance in establishing legal paternity and child support.  Otherwise you are on your own.</p>
<p>The first state that says &#8220;NO&#8221; to TANF, AFDC-related Medicaid, subsidized child care and Section 8 is a state that will quickly balance its books.<br>

		<p>Fund the support services with the hope that a few can break the cycle.  Don&rsquo;t fund it and it and many will suffer but the cycle will be broken.  There isn&rsquo;t a politician in the US with the guts to do the latter, and if there were they would have to be black least racism be claimed.  But it looks like excessive government debt and a sluggish economy will do some of the work for us as the money dries up.  There isn&rsquo;t enough money in the world to fund this &#8220;open loop&#8221; of madness.</p>

		<p>While not exclusively so, unwed pregnancy is overwhelmingly a black problem. The welfare culture upon which American blacks largely depend, which demands nothing by way of personal responsibility, virtually ensures that blacks will behave irresponsibly, and in many cases, criminally.</p>
<p>A burgeoning fatherless population practically ensures social chaos and, ultimately, disintegration.  </p>
<p>One of the largely unknown obsessions of Abraham Lincoln was the wholesale expulsion of former slaves from the US, if not back to Africa, then to islands of the Caribbean and the countries of Central America.  John Wilkes Booth evidentally was not privy to this information.  One wonders had he been would he have pulled the trigger.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just surprised that the writer is surprised. Things have been this way for the past 40 years and he&rsquo;s just now stumbling across it? He seems more concerned than the students and their families themselves are. Educational time, money and resources are just being squandered on the dead-enders. Steer them to vocational training that&rsquo;s not too difficult to learn so they can support themselves should they choose to do so, instead of staying on welfare.   </p>

		<p>It has long been apparent that Great Society programs and other local and state programs have long subsidized out of wedlock birth. You need only look at the illegitimacy rate for whites and blacks from say, 1965 to 2011. In the 60s they were approximately 8 percent for the whites and in the 20s for the blacks. The rates are now in the 20s for the whites and in the 70s for the blacks. The 70s!</p>
<p>The real scary part to the article was that Nicole was in the 11th grade, read at a 5th grade level, but was one of the teacher&rsquo;s &#8220;bright&#8221; students that he was coaxing to attend college. Its not just children having children, its morons having morons.<br>

		<p>Whose to say that being a single mother at 14 is not perfectly normal for people of African descent? Another case of liberals trying to stomp a square peg into a round hole by forcing Africans to conform to European standards. We&rsquo;re not all the same.</p>

		<p>Liberals will have 3 responses to this article:</p>
<p>1)  Teen pregnancy rates have dropped steadily<br>
2)  Girls of all races get pregnant<br>
3)  We need more birth control and sex ed in schools</p>
<p>Here is why these arguments are irrelevant:</p>
<p>1)  Teen pregnancy rates have dropped <i>nationally</i>, not in the subculture of the black slums.  The pregnancy rates of white teens does not influence the &#8216;hood.  </p>
<p>2)  While all races experience teen pregnancy, of course, blacks and hispanics have MUCH higher rates than whites and Asians.  NAMS also find teen pregnancy more socially acceptable.</p>
<p>3)  Many black teens <i>plan</i> their pregnancies, making sex ed solutions completely ineffective.  Birth control availability does not influence planned pregnancy.  <br>

<p>That&rsquo;s quite logical - would you want a 15 yr old thug taking care of your baby?  Does this author really think De&rsquo;vontavius will make a great babysitter and fatherly role model?  </p>

		<p>One thing all teachers have to get over: the 20th century concept that a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree is beneficial.</p>
<p>It is no longer useful.  All a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree is is 4 wasted years listenting to and regurgitating marxist anti White propaganda, horrendous student loans and credit card debt to pay for those $150.00 textbooks.</p>
<p>Even if a White American gets a degree in something useful like accounting, computers, engineering etc, they won&rsquo;t get jobs due to the government gestapo agencies like the Civil Rights Section of the Justice Department, the EEOC and the Judiciary.</p>
<p>High school teachers need to really get rid of the idea that they are developing fine young minds that will go to college, learn something useful and have a decent middle class life due to their college degree.</p>
<p>This applies to everyone of every race and economic class.  Maybe 30 years ago if these black girls got affirmative action degrees they could be offered affirmative action government jobs.</p>
<p>But affirmative action preference has moved from American blacks to any kind of non White foreigner.  Face it high school teachers, you are nothing but wardens in detention centers meant to keep teens out of the workplace and off the streets.</p>
<p>I was in France several years ago on vacation.  I read an op-ed article in the Sunday newspaper.  The title was &#8220;Juvenile delinquency was invented in 1960.&#8221;</p>
<p>1960 was the year that the French government in its wisdom decided that every citizen would be compelled to attend school until age 18.</p>
<p>Before that, high school was highly academic, meant only for those pursuing the equivalent of an American Master&rsquo;s degree.  Others went into an apprenticeship/high school program, work half day and school half day.  The kids were paid a small salary.  1/3 was for work and commuting expenses, 1/3 given to parents for room and board and 1/3 for personal expenses.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful thing.  Kids could start out as check bundlers and become bank managers, bag boys and girls became market managers, clerks could become accountants.</p>
<p>American high schools spend inordinate amounts of time on self esteem exercises for the dolts who read at 2nd grade level.  But what better boost to one&rsquo;s self esteem than doing an adult job, earning money and contributing to the household at 15?</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s point was that an academic high school is useless for most people, that there are much better ways to prepare for the workplace than high school and that boys in particular do not benefit from being crowded into classrooms run by women teachers.</p>
<p>One of the Prussian&rsquo;s original ideas back in 1820 was that the schools would produce punctual, obedient workers.  Unfortunately the black children of America have turned the schools into unsafe zoos where  even basic safety has disappeared. </p>
<p>Get over it teacher.  Those girls have IQs in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s.  The best thing they can do for themselves is to get on the welfare wagon.  After taxes, commuting, and other work expenses are taken out, many so called middle class jobs pay no more than welfare.  At least the welfare Mother&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t have to put 20,000 miles on their car every year just to get to work.</p>
<p>Teacher, look at your take home pay and then deduct all your work expenses.  Is your net income so much more than that of a welfare Mother?</p>

		<p>Having a child is the most important duty of a human being. </p>
<p>In our complex society, the preparation has to begin in childhood. Youth must be groomed to be productive members of the nation - educated, law-abiding, self-reliant and competent to reproduce a family.</p>
<p>State support for unwed mothers has become the destroyer of society and family life. The children who&rsquo;ve followed the virtuous path to adulthood must work and pay taxes to support the care-free fecundity of others.</p>
<p>Introduce race into the equation, and you have mainly whites generating the wealth that could be used to help their own children instead being confiscated and given to non-whites.</p>

		<p>Those with with knowledge of economics knows that a subsidy shifts the supply curve to the right and in fact that usually why governments subsidize to get more of something.  For example tax incentives to buy an electric car.  Welfare benefits to unwed mothers act as subsidies, you don&rsquo;t need to be a economist or have ever read Freaknomics to know you will get more single mothers.   </p>
<p>The same can be true with illegal immigrants, they know they get eight hours of baby sitting every day for there kids, the government will feed them both breakfast and lunch.  They know the local emergency room will treat there medical conditions.  Both government and non government agency&rsquo;s will make sure they have food in the house and on and on. </p>
<p>In there eyes subsistence living via the government is not so bad. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see this as entirely a racial phenomenon   &mdash;   and in fact, &#8220;urban&#8221; (newspeak code for <i>black</i>) unwed pregnancy rates make it undeniable.  But at the same time, I see this among increasing numbers of White girls, as well. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Within my lifetime, single parenthood has been transformed from shame to saintliness. In our society, perversely, we celebrate the unwed mother as a heroic figure, like a fireman or a police officer.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Exactly so.  And this transformation has come about because <i>feminists</i> want it that way.  With a single unwed pregnancy, any girl can now become an instant saint, petted and praised by peers and society.  Girls with an already low opinion of themselves can transform themselves into feminist icons in a single careless night, and the long-term consequences of their irresponsibility won&rsquo;t seep into their awareness for years   &mdash;   if ever.</p>
<p>You go, girl.  You&rsquo;ve come a long way, baby.</p>

		<p>Way back in the fifties and sixties, when I was a public school student, pregnant females were immediately thrown out of their regular public school and placed in what was known as &ldquo;the pregnant school&rdquo;- a school for pregnant females. They remained there until the birth of the child, and then transferred to another school. They were not allowed to return to their original school. Parents wanted the responsibility of teaching their kids about &ldquo;the birds and the bees&rdquo; and not have them learn about sex from promiscuous males and females. At that time, school personnel backed them up on that decision. This is considered &ldquo;old- fashioned and stupid&rdquo; now. Now, girls are allowed to remain in their assigned school throughout their pregnancy. If they want to attend a special school that caters to pregnant teenagers, they can; but it is not forced upon them. I have a friend who is a teacher in one of those schools, and she says that it is really pathetic when these girls enroll in the school and find out their &ldquo;baby&rsquo;s daddy&rdquo; has several other pregnant females there, and a &ldquo;battle royal&rdquo; takes place.</p>
<p>When I began my teaching career in 1975, teachers joked about the forty-year-old grandmothers, and that was bad enough. Now, it&rsquo;s a different ballgame (no pun intended). Grandmothers are in their thirties and great-grandmothers are in their late forties or early fifties. As the writer pointed out, &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s urban high school, there is no shame or social ostracism when girls become pregnant. Other girls in school want to pat their stomachs. Their friends throw baby showers at which meager little gifts are given.&rdquo; In fact, some principals even allow baby showers in a classroom during a teacher�?s planning period, in the principal�?s conference room, or after school. When it comes to enabling these girls, some of the school personnel are as bad as the students. Instead of giving them &ldquo;the real facts of life&rdquo; about what will probably happen to them and their illegitimate child (permanent poverty), they coddle and fawn over these girls.</p>

		<p>as horrific as the problem of the black underclass is, it was and remains manageable (albeit unimprovable and chronic) as long as blacks are circa 12% of the population and are only having ca 2 children per &#8220;family&#8221; (which is to say, per female).</p>
<p>it is the black underclass in combination with massive Third World immigration, mainly from Mexico, but also from Africa, etc., that the burden of a non-white underclass becomes utterly unaffordable - not just a drag on society, but its inevitable doom.</p>
<p>curbing nonwhite immigration and paying morons to be sterilized are the only thing that occur to me at this point.</p>
<p>meanwhile, Connecticut may go bankrupt supporting retarded teenagers the families, but at this point, it remains one of the most segregated places on earth:</p>
<p>Liberals may be willing to pay taxes to support blacks, but he is not willing to live with them.</p>
<p>given current levels of immigration, there will be no white enclaves left in 10 years, so when the social services empire collapses for lack of funding, we will have nowhere to hide during the ensuing riots. </p>

		<p>From the comments:</p>
<p><i>While not exclusively so, unwed pregnancy is overwhelmingly a black problem.</i></p>
<p>Steve, believe it or not, unwed pregnancy has actually fallen in the teen black community, even though half of black females will be pregnant before the age of 20.   But, it is rampant in the Hispanic community, especially with the anchor baby enticement thrown in.</p>
<p>According to <i>Facts on American Teens&rsquo; Sexual and <br>
Reproductive Health,</i>  January, 2010:</p>
<p><i>The pregnancy rate among black teens decreased 45% between 1990 and 2005.</i></p>
<p><i>Black and Hispanic women have the highest teen pregnancy rates (126 and 127 per 1,000 women aged 15–19, respectively); non-Hispanic whites have the lowest rate (44 per 1,000).</i></p>
<p>Unfortunately:</p>
<p><i>The overall teen pregnancy rate was up 3 percent in 2006, with a 4 percent rise in the rate of births and a 1 percent rise in the rate of abortions.</i></p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/yjk2qcy</p>
<p>And from Anon:</p>
<p><i>High school teachers need to really get rid of the idea that they are developing fine young minds that will go to college, learn something useful and have a decent middle class life due to their college degree.</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know one single high school teacher that believes this.  Not One. These  are lies spouted by the media, government and ivory-towered Bill Ayers types, those who would never deign to set foot on an urban school campus, yet pontificate on how things should be based on emotions, feelings and a desire to destroy White America.  Anyone who disagrees with the government lies is a racist, hater, bigot and Nazi.</p>
<p>We on the front lines well know the futility of wasting time on most of the kids we see these days as the vast majority are far from college material.  Hell, most of the students we see should have been let go after 5th grade as that is about as far as they&rsquo;ll ever be capable of going.</p>
<p>But, we must mouth the platitudes of the current PC regime&rsquo;s egalitarian Reign of Terror that has descended upon the schools lest we put our jobs and pensions at risk.  </p>
<p>Face it high school teachers, you are nothing but wardens in detention centers meant to keep teens out of the workplace and off the streets.</p>
<p>Then we are performing a public service, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anyone more than high school teachers who wish these loser and thugs were out on the streets and not in our classrooms where they freely hassle/assault us, interrupt our lessons with their clownish antics, and score rock-bottom on state tests for which we are blamed.  Not one teacher I know enjoys having these types in class.  Let &#8216;em drop out.  Make the parent responsible.</p>
<p>From Madison:</p>
<p><i>I always laugh at these liberal idealists who teach public school in the hood.</i></p>
<p>Madison:  Urban school districts have a terrible time finding teachers to staff these kinds of schools.  This is why they are forced to turn to Teach for America types, interns, substitute teachers, provisional and lemon teachers who have been forced out of better schools.  Conditions are so hopeless and difficult that  by Christmas vacation the idealistic TFAs and interns are mostly gone and the school is staffed by substitutes.  Repeat year in and year out.</p>
<p>A recent round of lay-offs in my district (by seniority) wiped out two-thirds of the teaching staffs of some of these schools!.  The ACLU went straight to court to undermine teacher seniority and won, as a matter of Social Justice, you see, so now these schools&rsquo; (what pass for) teachers are protected from lay-offs.  What difference would it make?</p>
<p>The idealistic liberals have the stuffing taken out of them within a week or two in an urban classroom, soon realizing that everything told to them in ed school is a d***** lie.  Some of the most hard-core, right-wing, staunch anti-immigration pro-White types that I know started out in a black-majority classroom.  </p>
<p>One ex- marxist teacher told me his first NAM school  was so terrible that it should have been reduced to rubble of a diameter no more than 1/2 inch, the rubble bulldozed completely into the earth and then the ground heavily salted so nothing will ever rise on that miserable piece of land again. </p>
<p>Another ex-marxist teacher told me nothing should be left standing within a block radius of his old NAM school; the projects and Section 8 apartments leveled into dust at the same time as the school.</p>
<p>Oh, if the Walls Could Talk&hellip;.</p>

		<p>While the article is stating the obvious, it doesn&rsquo;t provide much insight into the problem. The other side of it includes young people going to school, accumulating mountains of debt and marrying way, way too LATE. Late pregnancies aren&rsquo;t any better, nor are the singles who miss the train altogether and remain childless.</p>
<p>And for what? More and more of these &#8220;normal&#8221; young people can&rsquo;t find jobs, unless they move to China or something, but either way, the risk of default is high and it is payed by the withering &#8220;service economy&#8221;. The &#8220;service economy&#8221; itself is nothing more than a flickering mirage which will dissipate in the day the Chinese decide to buy oil with their own currency.</p>
<p>The kids don&rsquo;t care about education or family because these options aren&rsquo;t really better. That&rsquo;s the real problem.<br>

		<p>Gee whiz, I thought welfare reform was supposed to end this sort of thing.  </p>
<p>Some other thoughts:</p>
<p>1) If the black underclass is having children at younger ages, they will eventually swamp the middle class (of all races). It&rsquo;s a form of population warfare.</p>
<p>2) We have to hold feminism accountable here, in part.  Destroying the &#8220;patriarchal&#8221; family and replacing it with a government run &#8220;village&#8221; raising children via various bureaucratic programs means that (responsible) men are being driven out of homes. Effectively, you end up with a matrilineal society.  Meanwhile, taxpayers get to pick up the tab for all this.</p>
<p>3) The entire thing is dysgenic, promoting the underclass and (if the article is a description of the typical pregnant teenager), the lower IQ end of the demographic at that. Then we ask why this country is going down the tubes. You replace the original leadership class with an expanding demographic of low-IQ clients of the welfare state  &mdash;  and it becomes formula for civilizational decline.</p>

		<p>&#8220;No one gets married anymore&#8221;- I have a sort of &#8220;hobby&#8221; whenever I see adults with children; I look for wedding rings. What ever happened to them? White and Black. You do see a lot of rings on older white people. In my little hobby I get myself a real &#8220;score&#8221; when I see a black woman or couple with children and who are wearing rings. My score is very low. When I do see a ring on a black woman or couple I want to be all gooey and walk over and tell them how wonderful it is etc, but&hellip; of course that would be seen as racist and all that. Oh.. another part of the hobby is to look at blacks portrayed on television and advertising: there it is ring city!</p>

		<p>Wow!  I could have written a similar article.  I see the same things everyday, but where I&rsquo;m at, they&rsquo;re all latinos, mostly mexicans and dominicans.  </p>
<p>Every reader of AMREN needs to know and internalize that, yes, most of our urban &#8216;youth&rsquo; are usually 4-5 grade levels behind in everything at the high school level!  Some are even in worse shape than that.  I have &#8216;students&rsquo; who are 18-19 years old who, and I am not kidding, cannot do grade 2 work.</p>
<p>Young, liberal teachers, mostly female, fawn all over the bad boys in the school - coddling them, making escuses for them and, yes, hugging them all the time.  I have so little respect for white female teachers under the age of 25 that it&rsquo;s unnerving, but this is based on a whole lotta&rsquo; observation of their behavior with their male &#8216;students&rsquo; who theoretically they could be dating, and I have no doubt that many want to, based on their body language.</p>
<p>Every year we get a whole ton of preggers and the vaunted cradle-to-the-grave support network kicks in.  Our &#8216;social justice&rsquo; staff members fall all over themselves to &#8216;provide support.&rsquo;  Do the mothers appreciate it and pour themselves into their studies after that?  Not a chance.  </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Fund the support services with the hope that a few can break the cycle. Don&rsquo;t fund it and it and many will suffer but the cycle will be broken. There isn&rsquo;t a politician in the US with the guts to do the latter, and if there were they would have to be black least racism be claimed. But it looks like excessive government debt and a sluggish economy will do some of the work for us as the money dries up. There isn&rsquo;t enough money in the world to fund this &ldquo;open loop&rdquo; of madness.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This is where you are wrong, the money is being made by making men directly accountable for the welfare benefits for women (and to a lesser extent children), while at the same time criminalizing the act of fatherhood. Its gone beyond dealing with recalcitrant blacks in the cities, and has become mainstream to be applied to all cases of divorce, and out of wedlock births. In doing such, they have made a system that essentially turns non custodial parents into serfs. 72% of payers owe some form of back support payment, and when you include alimony it jumps to 77%. The default rate on mortgages; even in very hard times is less than 12%. The default rate on automobile loans is less than 15%, even in hard times. The default rate on unsecured credit cards is lower as well.  Essentially the state has created debt levels so high on the backs of individuals, called them criminals, and deadbeats as a control measure. They are for all intents &amp; purposes disenfranchised, and most can afford no meaningful legal redress (not that one exists) of their situations. Only a few can ever afford marriage, and the net effect is much of an entire generation destroyed. The deck is stacked because the state receives money for every dollar of debt it generates, and more for every bit it actually collects. It has no incentives for marriage, or for fathers to have any time with their kids. </p>
<p>These actions were intentional by the states, the federal government, and your so called welfare reform. This is no longer merely a race issue; it is one of men&rsquo;s rights generally, and societal survival if such an unbalanced system is allowed to continue. For the moment the tax payer is content to destroy 20-25% of the population for no real benefit because they think they are escaping the sting of it directly. </p>
