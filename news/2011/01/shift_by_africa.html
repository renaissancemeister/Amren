<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The nation&rsquo;s African-American population continued its southward migration over the past decade, shifting a large part of the black middle class from northern states to faster-growing economies of the South.</p>
<p>Among 25 big U.S. metro areas with the largest growth in African-American population between 2000 and 2009, 16 were in the South  &mdash;  including Atlanta and Dallas  &mdash;  according to the Census Bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey. Among the big losers were cities in the North and West, including Detroit, Los Angeles and Cleveland.</p>
<p>The biggest gainer was Atlanta, a magnet for black professionals. Its metro area added about 500,000 African-Americans between the 2000 and 2009 period, and more than twice the next-largest numeric gainer, Dallas, according to an analysis of Census data by William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Over the same period, the share of Atlanta&rsquo;s 25-and-over black population that had college degrees increased to 24.6% in 2009 from 21.5% in 2000.</p>
<p>Other southern cities including Houston, Charlotte, N.C., and Raleigh, N.C., were also among the nation&rsquo;s biggest gainers of African-Americans over the decade, each with higher-than-average growth in their black college-educated population, many of them newcomers, according to Mr. Frey.</p>
<p>Shifts in the black population mirror larger trends. The decline of manufacturing jobs has hobbled the economies of northern states such as Michigan and Ohio, prompting residents of all races to seek better fortunes elsewhere. California also has had an exodus of residents.</p>
<p>Melissa Harris-Perry, 37 years old, a professor of politics and African-American studies at Princeton University, has been an observer of the shift as well as a participant. She recently moved to New Orleans from Princeton and for the time being is commuting between the cities. There were many reasons from the move, including marriage, New Jersey&rsquo;s high living costs and property taxes and a desire to give her daughter the &#8220;robust black cultural experiences&#8221; that Ms. Harris-Perry says she couldn&rsquo;t find in Princeton.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All this is slowly unwinding the so-called Great Migration, the 20th-century movement of blacks from the South to the growing industrial cities of the East Coast, Midwest and West. In 1960, the South had 60% of the nation&rsquo;s black population. That fell to 53% by 1970. The South now has 56.8% of the nation&rsquo;s non-Hispanic black population, compared with 55.1% in 2000 and 53.6% in 1990, according to Mr. Frey. Since 2000, the South has had three quarters of the nation&rsquo;s Black population growth.</p>
<p>The movement of African-Americans has also shifted the distribution of the college-educated black population. In 2009 the metro area with the largest share of college-educated blacks was Washington D.C., just ahead of San Jose, Calif., which had the largest share in 2000.</p>
<p>San Jose, in the heart of California&rsquo;s Silicon Valley, saw its share of African-Americans with college degrees fall as the state bled residents over the decade. Atlanta, Raleigh and Nashville, Tenn., were all among the top five cities with the largest share of 25-and-over blacks with college degrees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The growth of minority populations in general, and huge turnout among black voters in particular, were among reasons President Barack Obama, a Democrat, won in traditionally Republican states like Virginia and North Carolina in 2008.</p>

<p>Really???  I mean, really????</p>
<p>That is the reason to move TO a place???  Especially a place of failure like New Orleans?  Citizens who were not intelligent enough to leave the city pre-Katrina decided that would rather bleat like lambs in the blazing heat with no AC instead of WADING out of New Orleans?  Or, alternatively, who were so overwhelmingly thirsty and hungy that they broke into Wal-Mart and similar shops and stole only those things necessary to sustain life   &mdash;   namely large screen TVs and expensive shoes?  The looting pictures were priceless.</p>
<p>This is the robust culture she is talking about?</p>

		<p>In the city that I live in, there&rsquo;s a tremendous influx of Indians (from India), different types of Orientals, Hispanics and others.  Non-Blacks.  They&rsquo;re here to make money.  They don&rsquo;t give a rats backside about assimilating and identifying with White European culture, but that&rsquo;s another issue.  They are pushing the Blacks slowly out of the city.  Of course Blacks, do not find it so easy to criticize or ridicule these other groups.  Blacks can easily cry &#8216;racism&rsquo; when it comes to Whites, but they can&rsquo;t complain so easily when other non-White groups take what they believe to be &#8220;Their&#8221; neighborhoods away from them.  Amazingly Harlem is &#8220;coming up&#8221;.  It is starting to become populated with others who aren&rsquo;t Black and the Blacks don&rsquo;t like it.  In one way it&rsquo;s good, because as everyone who comes to Amren knows, where Blacks go, crime follows.  In another way it&rsquo;s not good, because as all these other groups come in, they take job opportunities away from Whites.  As groups like Indians, and Orientals get more and more power, they hire their own.</p>

		<p>#2:  They still seethe inside.</p>
<p>Blacks cannot stand it when groups like the Vietnamese arrive on US shores with no money and no ability to speak English AND with the PTSD of having lived all their lives in a war zone.  Within 1 generation, Asian kids are highly educated over-achievers in life   &mdash;   doctors and lawyers and engineers and business owners.  And it is resented   &mdash;   as a similar example, look at the special targeting of Korean shops in the South Central riots, for instance.</p>
<p>A whole lot of blacks resent this success, since American Blacks have been free since 1863.  150 years, damn near.  And instead of a work ethic, we seen to get from many Blacks an &#8220;excuse ethic&#8221;. The boat people and their success put the lie to African American excuse-making, and yet it continues.</p>

		<p>Please note maps 3 and 4 on this page posted by the U.S. Census:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/4jcs66l</p>
<p>I believe they outline quite well the ethno-centric borders that are being determined by Americans (and Mexicans) regardless of what the social experimentists are trying to do.  Basically, the Southwest is pretty much lost to Mexico, and most of the Old South will, in my view, eventually be taken by African-Americans as a Black Nation.  Sort of a revenge against the White Slave holders of the past&hellip; Decendants of Slaves claiming the land once worked by Slaves, etc.  I certainly can&rsquo;t say how long it will take for the epiphanies of Nationhood to materialize, but if anyone believes this trend will reverse, please post any such evidence you may have as I would like to hear it. Thanks.</p>

<p>Heck, if she <i>really</i> wanted &ldquo;robust black cultural experiences,&#8221; she could have moved to Detroit with its 81% black population or Gary, Indiana with its 84% black population, rather than New Orleans with its piddling 67% black population. And can you imagine the outcry and scandal if a white person said she wanted to move to an area with  &ldquo;robust white cultural experiences?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Good for the black middle class to migrate to areas where they have roots and feel at home. Unfortunately, in Minneapolis-St. Paul the black population is pretty much the welfare dregs from other states and they don&rsquo;t seem to be going anywhere.</p>

		<p>The idea that blacks are moving to the south to be around other blacks is absurd. They are coming here because genuine white conservative policymaking works, and has continued in the South to a large degree despite the efforts of Washington liberals to make us turn our society over to people who could not have built and cannot maintain it. Unfortunately, we are becoming victims of our own success. By creating a growing and vital economy that attracts vast numbers of migrants from northern cities that have been destroyed by the tender loving care of black governance and white liberaldom, we&rsquo;ve caused our own demographic destruction. Already, the majority of births in my state are to nonwhites, portending a grim future.</p>

After a week of being terrorized by her own kind, she would no doubt flee to a majority-white gated community.

		<p> I get tired to the myth, shoved on us by Asians, that all Asians rise to the top and are a huge asset to American society. Wasn&rsquo;t it two chinese immigrant males who decapitated two people, in public? the Media hushed that up quick, omg, an illegal alien from china cuts off a white man&rsquo;s head on the bus in Canada.  It was buried really quick because the man killed was poor and  not a member of Congress. The media only likes it when white males flip out. Full coverage there, no back page problem.</p>
<p>The vietnamese and the Hmong are a huge problem as immigrants and they have drug gangs all over the west coast. A friend of mine left San Francisco when the Hong Kong Chinese moved in.  Ugly immigrants are everywhere.<br>
 As to blacks, it&rsquo;s six degrees of separation. One family moves in and their relatives who are in gangs or on PO hear about the new nice area where there are no gangs cause they just have nice white people there and the next thing you know, there&rsquo;s the gangs.</p>

		<p>It has become obvious that the great multicultural dream has failed, not only in the U.S., but worldwide.  Most people are more comfortable with their own kind, within their own culture.  American blacks can now seek housing in neighborhoods of any ethnicity, yet most gravitate to communities of their own color when the latter are available for people of their particular class.  Resentment is apparently growing for the idea that non-whites should &#8220;act white&#8221;.  The harder the liberals try to bleach out the culture of blacks, the more we hear about ebonics, rap, and Afrocentric schools.</p>

<p>The Blacks have been here since the beginning of this country, as both slave and free. They have gone to schools, have Christian churches, owned business, been elected to offices and have participated in the same aspects of American life that whites have. Yet every wave of Johny-come-lately immigration soon pushes them aside. Why? </p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks in particular have sought out the South, due, in part, to fading memories of 1960s race clashes&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe they are coming back here looking for guilt ridden whites to take care of them, something they can&rsquo;t find elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;The movement of blacks southward, as well as the continued growth of African-Americans in suburbs, has political implications.&#8221;</p>
<p>To dilute the conservative vote?</p>

		<p>Poster 6 is absolutely correct of course.  Of course we whites can&rsquo;t say that we prefer to be with our own kind.  I live in a Tennessean city where blacks are always whining about how life isn&rsquo;t fair.  Never mind of course that taking responsibility is a totally alien concept for many of these people.  I&rsquo;m LIVING for the day when I can complete my education and move to a Whitetopia. I&rsquo;m aware of demographic trends, too. Blacks ruin every place where they congregate in large numbers.</p>

Wade across the Mississippi River to the South maybe? or wade across 30x24 Mile Wide lake Pontchartrain to the North?<br>
I know, maybe people should have &#8220;Waded&#8221; through the endless miles of Swamps that surround the city on the East and West?</p>

		<p>According to demographics, large numbers of all types of people are flocking to the southern U.S.; not just blacks - largely for the climate and partly for the [albeit perceived] better employment numbers. I would love to tell them the employment numbers are totally skewed and there aren&rsquo;t any more jobs here than anywhere else, but the blacks are often on welfare anyway.</p>

<p>to hold the South solely responsible for slavery is ignorant and totally false.  Slaves were brought to the colonies via northern port cities as well and many northerners profited from the slave trade.  As a matter of fact, slavery was legal in the New England states until the early 1800&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The number of blacks is growing faster than the number of whites.  So every year, there are more blacks relative to whites.  The proportion of blacks in the population, which is what I think you are talking about, is holding steady at about 12-13%.  The percentages of Asians and Hispanics are growing rapidly and the percentage of whites is declining by the same amount as the Asian/Hispanic growth rate.  </p>

Black crime is a legitimate concern. Nevertheless, without blacks the U.S. cuisine would be less varied, there would be no jazz, no rock &amp; roll, fewer good novels and short stories, and fewer Olympic medals. <br>
 <br>
Anyway, they are native here. They aren&rsquo;t going anywhere. We might as well try to get along with them.</p>

		<p>Blacks seem to behave better when they are rooted in the soil. They have about 2,500 years of agriculture behind them. That means about 100 generations to evolve. They have only recently been introduced to urban civilization. Their move to Northern cities has not been good for them. It has not been good for the cities. </p>

Yes, never mind the fact that the vast majority of white southerners never owned slaves, and that it was the north which ended the institution suddenly without any realistic plan for dealing with the freed blacks. A resettlement plan would have been a perfectly equitable solution to the black problem, and could have been carried out in step with a gradual emancipation. But the Radical Republicans were more interested in trying to use freed slaves, carpetbaggers, and white southern collaborators to turn the south Republican, and establish a one-party government.<br>
&#8220;without blacks the U.S. cuisine would be less varied&#8221;<br>
Oh dear, that would just kill us.<br>
&#8220;there would be no jazz, no rock &amp; roll&#8221;<br>
There would also be none of that godawful rap music, or its imitators.<br>
&#8220;fewer good novels and short stories&#8221;<br>
You mean like &#8220;Roots&#8221;, much of which was plagiarized from &#8220;The African&#8221; (which was, of course, by a white author)?<br>
&#8220;and fewer Olympic medals&#8221;<br>
Yes, because knowing that someone from you country can sprint faster than someone from another country makes up for not being safe in your own home, being discriminated against in employment and academics, having your culture denigrated by people who thing rap music is the highest form of art, and having to put up with a national holiday being devoted to a race-hustling, communist-sympathizing plagiarist adulterer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks seem to behave better when they are rooted in the soil.&#8221;<br>
What nonsense is this? They behave better when whites refuse to grovel to them. Indeed, a white cop came off the better for it by refusing to be shamed by the most powerful mulatto on earth. Black crime wasn&rsquo;t nearly as big a problem when the police were unafraid to enforce the law. But that&rsquo;s not going to happen with a heavily black electorate, and their Hispanic and Asian allies (both of which the northern states forced on the south in two brilliant pieces of legislative genius).</p>

		<p>Besides, whites have only been (heavily) urbanized for slightly longer than blacks, and yet cities aren&rsquo;t being wracked by massive white crime waves. I haven&rsquo;t noticed a huge crime problem with Scots-Irish who&rsquo;ve settled in major cities (certainly not on the scale of black crime). Does John even think before posting?</p>

<p>(Sigh). Here we go again with the latest round of White Southerner Denial Syndrome. (WSDS).</p>
<p>&#8220;Slaves were brought to the colonies via northern port cities..&#8221;</p>
<p>Not really true and even less relevant. What matters is WHY the slaves were brought in and WHERE they went. And that was to the south.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.many northerners profited from the slave trade&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps a few did, but many more did so in the south (to say nothing of the slaveowners themselves who obviously benefitted enormously from having a free-labour force).</p>
<p>&#8221;..slavery was legal in the New England states until the early 1800&rsquo;s&#8221;.</p>
<p> Firstly the north began ending slavery as early as 1777 (Vermont). For every slave in the north there were DOZENS in the south. And in any case the north DID abolish slavery and did it on its own. </p>
<p>What southern state ever voluntarily ended slavery? ZERO.</p>
<p>The north ended it entirerly by 1804 when New Jersey abolished it.</p>
<p>How many slave states did the south create AFTER the revolutionary war (thus expanding the presence of blacks)? NINE.</p>
<p>How many did the north create? Zero.</p>
<p>Who prevented the FREE SOIL party from stopping slavery being allowed in Texas in the 1840&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s? The south.</p>
<p>Who used terrorism and atrocities to try to spread slavery into Kansas (&#8216;bleeding Kansas&rsquo;)? The south. This was itself a violation of the Missouri compromise which the south had sworn to uphold.</p>
<p>Had there been no southern slavery, and the social, cultural, economic and political schisms it created in America, plus the south&rsquo;s pigheaded determination to expand it, (when it should have been clear slavery was an anachronism. Haiti ended it in 1804 and the British empire in 1837.) the civil war would not have happened. 600,000 white Americans need not have died. </p>
<p>So yes Aunt Bea, I feel quite comfortable in blaming the south for our nations&rsquo; past and present ills. Just the facts ma&rsquo;am.</p>

		<p>21-John E. - &#8220;Nevertheless, without blacks the U.S. cuisine would be less varied, there would be no jazz, no rock &amp; roll, fewer good novels and short stories, and fewer Olympic medals.&#8221;</p>
<p>John, You can&rsquo;t be serious&hellip; are you? I am certain music genres would have developed over time regardless of where on the planet people lived.  And even if America had a few less novels and stories, I don&rsquo;t think we would have just up and died because of it.  As for Olympic medals, and even the other items you mention here, if these achievements could have been credited to Africa, the people of the entire African continent might feel better about its past, present and future to where they may have developed Africa into something other than the basket case that it is.  I do agree though, that Black crime is a legitimate concern.  So much so in fact that I would gladly trade all of the &#8220;good&#8221; items above in return for a zero Black crime rate.</p>

		<p>19 - Aunt Bea: I agree that the South is not solely responsible for Slavery. But if there is debate about which side, North or South, which benefited moreso from, encouraged, or extended the practice of Slavery to the greater extent, I believe most people would agree that it is &#8220;The South&#8221; that would win that debate. Hence, the comments by #16 are quite understandable.</p>

The South as a whole did not benefit from slavery. The large planters did, because they got cheap labor, but this came at the expense of poor whites.<br>
As for growing the size of the inassimilable nonwhite population to crisis proportions, we have only the north to thank for that. It was liberal Democrats and Republicans who supported the 1965 treason that opened our borders to anyone with a relative here. White southerners who wanted to guard the borders against the invaders and remove illegals from the country were derided as &#8220;rednecks&#8221; and &#8220;white trash&#8221; by liberal white northerners. In 1960, this country was almost 90% white. Yes, the black population was a problem, but it was an easily manageable one compared to the exploding Hispanic, South Asian, middle eastern, and immigrant black populations. It&rsquo;s these people who threaten to reduce whites to a minority, and their influx is primarily the fault of immigration policies championed by northerners (who, until recently, usually didn&rsquo;t have to live with the immigrants), including the most liberal Congressman (from one of the whitest states), Teddy Kennedy. And it&rsquo;s mostly white northerners (along with Latino politicians and liberal blacks) who push to CONTINUE these insane policies, even though they should know where they&rsquo;re leading.<br>
But it&rsquo;s easier to whale on the defeated, almost 150 years after the fact, than to acknowledge the insanity promoted by one&rsquo;s own side in the last 50.</p>

<p>(Sigh). Your self-serving revisionism is quite untrue and disingenuous.</p>
<p> &#8220;&hellip;never mind the fact that the vast majority of white southerners never owned slaves..&#8221;</p>
<p>SOMEBODY IN THE SOUTH SURE OWNED THEM! There were well over four million of them in the south by 1861. They sure didn&rsquo;t own themselves!</p>
<p> For southerners the slavery issue is like Germans and the Nazis and their crimes. Most Germans were not Nazis and didn&rsquo;t participate in the Third Reich&rsquo;s crimes. But to argue that the south was not responsible for slavery is like saying Germany was not to blame for the holocaust and other atrocities. Its a circular arguement that goes nowhere.</p>
<p> &#8220;..it was the north that ended the institution suddenly without any realistic plan for dealing with the freed blacks..&#8221;</p>
<p> NOT TRUE AT ALL! Putting aside the question of what &#8220;plan&#8221; the south had to free them (in fact that was the last thing the south ever had in mind) the north undertook many measures to rid our country of the burden and danger of slavery. First, the north NEVER EXPANDED slavery. Every new state that entered the union in the north was a free state. This CONTAINED the problem in the original revolutionary-era states. In the north slavery never expaned west of the Appalachians. The south in contrast expanded slavery EVEYRWHERE IT COULD. Secondly the north ended slavery in its original territory within a generation of independence. The Free Soil party tried very hard to keep slavery out of Texas and any other parts of Mexico that might subsequently become American territory. The south scuttled this plan. The southern slave power plantocracy blocked every attempt by the north to contain slavery or work for the emancipation of the slaves. The south never had any abolitionist movements or made any efort to convert slavery to serfdom. Any study of 19th century American history shows how the south was completely closed to any effort on the part of the north to change its ways. Had it not been for the civil war WHEN EXACTLY was the south going to end slavery?</p>
<p> Why won&rsquo;t southerners just admit their foolish, greedy and short-sighted ancestors screwed up things for all of us???? </p>
