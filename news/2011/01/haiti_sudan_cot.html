			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bret Stephens, Wall Street Journal, January 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Once upon a time in West Africa, two kings named Acqua and Bell made a memorable request of British Prime Minister William Gladstone. &#8220;We are tired of governing the country ourselves,&#8221; they wrote in a letter dated Nov. 6, 1881. &#8220;Every dispute leads to war, and often to great loss of life, so we think it is the best thing to give up the country to you British men who no doubt will bring peace, civilization and Christianity in the country. Do for mercy&rsquo;s sake please lay our request before the queen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We are quite willing to abolish all our heathen customs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The kings&rsquo; offer (which Gladstone declined) makes for interesting reading as one postcolonial state  &mdash;  Sudan  &mdash;  votes this week to split in two, with uncertain consequences. Another state  &mdash;  Côte d&rsquo;Ivoire  &mdash;  stands on a razor&rsquo;s edge between outright dictatorship and civil war. And a third  &mdash;  Haiti, a de facto American colony from 1915 to 1934  &mdash;  has proved unable to pick itself even inches off the ground since last year&rsquo;s devastating earthquake. What, if anything, does it all mean?</p>
<p>It means that we&rsquo;ve come full circle. It means that colonialism, for which the West has spent the past five decades in nonstop atonement, was far from the worst thing to befall much of the colonized world. It means, also, that some new version of colonialism may be the best thing that could happen to at least some countries in the postcolonial world.</p>
<p>Take Haiti. Haiti is no longer a colony of the West, but it has long been a ward of it. Even before the earthquake, remittances and foreign aid accounted for nearly 30% of its GDP. The country is known as the &#8220;Republic of NGOs,&#8221; since some 3,000 operate in it. What good they&rsquo;ve done, considering the state the country has been in for decades, is an open question. Security, to the extent there is any, is provided by some 12,000 U.N. peacekeepers. {snip}</p>
<p>But last year&rsquo;s fraudulent elections are a reminder that Haitians have been as ill-served by their democracy as by their periodic dictatorships. When &#8220;Baby Doc&#8221; Duvalier was overthrown in 1986, per capita GDP was $768. In 2009, on the eve of the quake, it was $519. Nor do the troubles end there: Criminality is rampant, and Haiti ranked 177th out of 179 on Transparency International&rsquo;s 2008 corruption index. These are not the depredations of greedy foreign interlopers. This is the depravity of the locals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Côte d&rsquo;Ivoire used to be one of those promising African states bucking the usual trends of the continent. But then per capita GDP plummeted by about 40% in the past 40 years. More recently, the country has seen a civil war between north and south and military intervention by French troops. Now its president, Laurent Gbagbo, refuses to concede an election the U.N. insists he lost to challenger Alassane Ouattara, a former International Monetary Fund official.</p>
<p>{snip} U.N. peacekeepers aren&rsquo;t going to force him out. {snip} There&rsquo;s the U.N. and all its failures explained in a nutshell.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Postcolonial Africa has seen the future. As often as not, it looks like Zimbabwe. The West professes to &#8220;care&#8221; about countries like Haiti, Côte d&rsquo;Ivoire and  &mdash;   at least for as long as George Clooney is in the area  &mdash;  south Sudan. But &#8220;care&#8221; at the level of simple emotion is little more than a cheap vanity. The colonialists of yore may often have been bigots, but they were also, just as often, doers. Their colonies were better places than the shipwrecked countries we have today.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering just how far into complete chaos Africa will go if this present global economic mess continues to get worse, as it is expected to do.  The countries there are getting aid from the US and Europe, but that will be withdrawn as austerity measures in the West are invoked on a serious level.</p>
<p>It looks like we can expect the entire sub-Saharan continent to erupt into violence, with the worse fighting in South Africa where it looks like a racial war could be looming.</p>

		<p>However the future might not include conscience-stricken whites as the major colonizers. If the Chinese decide to take over Africa for their own purposes the guilt element will be negligible. It will be Lebensraum and that alone.<br>
The world will not care because the Chinese will point out, persuasively, the expulsion of useless African &#8220;farmers&rsquo; will be necessary in light of extreme food requirements.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, there are no longer enough white men around to should the the White Man&rsquo;s Burden. And, to be perfectly honest, we don&rsquo;t want to. We&rsquo;ve had enough of trying to uplift people who respond by screaming &#8220;oppression&#8221;, and then blaming us when there own mismanagement turns their independence into a nightmare.</p>
<p>They can ask the Chinese to rule them, if they so desire. Sure, the Chinese will probably be far worse than Europeans, but the Africans have already made their feelings about whites perfectly clear, given that the last group of Europeans on the continent, the Boers, are being systematically hounded from their country by the blacks.</p>

<p>My grandfather lived in an African colony community for many years and he said the same thing. I remember him saying to me when I was growing up that (and I paraphrase) &#8220;things might not have been &#8216;humanitarian&rsquo; by today&rsquo;s standards but living by the ways of the European was far better for the natives as we provided law and order, a constant food supply, education, clothing and a roof over their heads. Compare that to the natives who did not; they were nearly always malnourished and illiterate and whenever things got tough they killed their neighbouring tribesmen for the resources they failed to plan for, which only created resentment and feuds that lasted generations until no one knew what the original issue was about other than the neighbouring tribe was aggressive.&#8221;</p>

		<p>From what I hear, Africa IS being recolonized&hellip;by the Chinese. Unlike the white European colonists of the 19th centuries, the Chinese have no sense of &#8220;the white man&rsquo;s burden&#8221; and will stop at nothing to get the mineral resources it needs to expand its economy, up to and including slaughtering anyone who stands in its way. When that happens, white colonial rule will seem like paradise by comparison.</p>

		<p>In Answer To Bret Stephen&rsquo;s Editorial: &ldquo;Haiti, Sudan, Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire: Who Cares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stephens editorializes that the developed world&rsquo;s bungling attempts to help these nations over the last century, are hypocritical. He ends with a statement that we should be prepared to &ldquo;shoulder the full burden&rdquo; of these third world nations&rsquo; attempts to better themselves. </p>
<p>I wonder what Mr. Stephens means by &ldquo;shoulder the full burden&rdquo;? Is he asking us to pay for all of the food, clothing, medical care, shelter, and the various other human needs that the restive populations of these nations want and need? Is he asking us to send even more aid, let&rsquo;s say the equivalent of double the entire GNP of each nation? Is he asking each of us to personally make an &ldquo;aid pilgrimage&rdquo; to one of these nations to render service to them as a means of shouldering the burden? Who knows? </p>
<p>Like all of the generators of guilt that inhabit the establishment press, Mr. Stephens just lobs verbal grenades to get us all worked up so we feel bad and don&rsquo;t yell too much when our out-of-control government wastes more money on people that can&rsquo;t and/or won&rsquo;t help themselves! Like most of the establishment that he lackeys for, Stephens wants to &ldquo;buy the world a Coke&rdquo;&hellip; on the taxpayers&rsquo; dime. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a challenge for you Stephens. Why don&rsquo;t you demonstrate what &ldquo;shouldering the whole burden&rdquo; means? Instead of merely stirring the pot, why don&rsquo;t you show us all how to serve the soup? I realize that that&rsquo;s a big job. History has shown, as you are well aware, that it&rsquo;s not even achievable. Since that&rsquo;s the case, why don&rsquo;t you quit your moralizing and stick to reporting on facts? </p>
<p>Stephens and his idealist journalistic ilk have done more to screw up this world and ruin the United States as have the errant statesmen that we have produced in abundance. We need always to realize that we can only help ourselves. it is, at best, very difficult to help any individual to truly change, it is impossible to help entire nations. <br>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.  &#8220;Bigots&#8221; the Europeans may have been, but they were caring bigots.  Sort of like Archie Bunker.  Life was never so good for the primitive people of the world as it was during colonialism, neither before nor after it.  I have long felt that colonialism was by far the best thing to happen to the Dark Continent.  In fact, I used to get boiling mad (on the inside) whenever my 9th-grade World Geography teacher would go on anti-colonial rants when we were learning about Africa.</p>

		<p>I disagree entirely with the tenor of this article.<br>
 The very worst mistake that the white race ever made in its history, a mistake that in all probability end in the death of the white race, was to ever get involved in the slightese degree with the people of sub-saharan Africa.If a policy of the strictest possible non-engagement on any terms with black Africa was instituted centuries ago, then whites would still have a chance of survival.</p>

		<p>It seems that, finally, fifty years after everybody, the Wall Street Journal discovers that decolonization was, in Africa, an economic and human disaster. Maybe in 2060 they will dicover that there is such a thing as race&hellip; What will they discover by 2110 ? No one knows&hellip; They are such discoverers&hellip; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been a subscriber to the WSJ for over thirty years. Frankly, it&rsquo;s so far superior to any other daily in the world that it&rsquo;s no wonder that its circulation, quality, and scope keep growing when all around them, clinging fiercely to their liberal ideology, are shrinking and finally disappearing altogether.  The Journal, while maintaining a generally conservative (read sane) tone, also does a good job of presenting opposing views.</p>
<p>Bret Stephens is a good example of somewhat liberal columnist for the Journal, though a good and responsible one.  In his piece on Haiti he&rsquo;s merely noting that sub-Sahara Africa and its Caribbean colony of Haiti were far better off under white rule. I hope he&rsquo;s not suggesting that we once again take up &#8220;the White Man&rsquo;s burden&#8221; to re-civilize Africa and Haiti.  We already have enough trouble with the all black enclaves of America.</p>

		<p>Africa probably could benefit from recolonization, but would the West?  The only third-world colony that ever made it&rsquo;s European owners much of a return was India.  This is because local rulers at various levels were left in charge for the most part, so the place was largely self-governing (and certainly more peaceful than if English foreigners had been exclusively in charge).  The Spanish certainly took a lot of gold out of their American colonies and used this to fund the Hapsburgs&rsquo; wars, but this was very much a mixed blessing, as the huge influx of gold merely cause massive price inflation in the food and manufactured goods needed for these wars.  Finally can we be seriously expected to believe that France economically benefited from control of places like Chad or that Germany would never have risen to Great Power status without control of the Namibian desert or isolated islands in the Marshals and Carolines groups?</p>
<p>Colonial ownership carried an additional hazard; conflict.  Not only were uprisings by the locals against colonial rule common (like the Indian Army Mutiny or the Anglo-Boer wars), but the locals were also in frequent conflict with each other (Zulus versus Xhosas, Zulus versus Boers etc, Burma&rsquo;s attempt to invade India in 1824, etc.)  This conflict forced the colonial powers to spend even more money than necessitated by ordinary policing and administrative work.  Finally, it brought major powers into conflict with each other; Britain nearly went to war with Russia and France several times in the late 1800s and Britain and France did fight Russia from 1853-1856 over influence in what was a rapidly-collapsing Ottoman Empire.  Japan fought China in 1895 for possession of Okinawa and Taiwan and then fought Russia over Korea in 1904-05, and France fought China in 1884-85 over control of Tonkin (now northern Vietnam).  The example of colonial conflict best known by most Americans was the Spanish-American in 1898 over possession of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.  As much trouble as Spain was having with insurrections in these places, they certainly weren&rsquo;t making a profit from owning them, and this leaves aside the devastating losses in warships and regrettable loss of life they suffered at Manila Bay and off Santiago.</p>
<p>Colonial possession also complicates domestic politics; the military coup in Portugal in 1974 was mainly the result of the Portuguese military&rsquo;s distaste for the continued combat operations in Angola and Mozambique.  This coup was brought off bloodlessly and free elections were held 18 months later, but the Algerian War saw the French army split during two attempted coups and this resulted in a civil war between pro-French hardliners in Algeria and Charles de Gaulle&rsquo;s supporters; this included several attempts by rebel paratroops to invade France, including a successful occupation of Corsica by paratroopers based in Algeria.  This conflict resulted in the collapse of the French Fourth Republic in 1958.  It took some time for France&rsquo;s troubles to subside even with the founding of the Fifth Republic; the Paris Massacre of 1961 saw some 200 peaceful demonstrators killed by police, and there were several assassination attempts made on de Gaulle&rsquo;s life, including a machine gun ambush in 1962 in which 14 bullets hit de Gaulle&rsquo;s Citroen, miraculously injuring nobody.  Portugal&rsquo;s and France&rsquo;s political problems were clearly caused by colonialism. </p>
<p>My impression is that most of these colonies were acquired largely for reasons of national prestige, much in the manner space programs serve today.  Given the multiple drawbacks to colony ownership, it is fair to state the West does not need them and never really did.<br>

<p>This should be a primary goal for all whites and it goes for us living within the United States as well. We should help those who help themselves- so we must be aware of where our money for charity and volunteer time, etc&hellip;is going. </p>

		<p>In strict Darwinian terms,   &mdash;   which people are increasing their share of the population?   &mdash;   blacks are winning hands down.  (Except in the U.S., where they&rsquo;re second to Latinos.)  So blacks are succeeding on their own terms.  Let them run their own countries as they wish, just don&rsquo;t bring more of them to white countries.  Even if we could raise their material standard of living by recolonizing their countries they&rsquo;d hate us for it.  I&rsquo;m all for benign neglect.<br>

		<p>I wonder why Haiti is lumped in with Africa as one of the former colonies of  &#8220;The West&#8221;.   Haiti is IN the west.  In the Caribbean, far to the west of France, which first colonized it.  </p>
<p>Haiti was the first Western European country in which blacks genocided the whites.  The natural, sane, life-loving response from white people everywhere should be eternal enmity.  Instead, we seem in a suicidal frenzy to give what&rsquo;s left of every white country to them and their African cousins, and to Mestizo Indians, and anybody and everybody else - as long as they are not white.  </p>
