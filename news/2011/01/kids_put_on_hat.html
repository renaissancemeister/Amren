<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/?pageId=254057">Kids Put on &#8216;Hate Crimes&rsquo; List for Schoolyard Taunts</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Drew Zahn, WorldNetDaily, January 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly 30,000 British schoolchildren last year alone had their names added to a &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; bullying list for making taunts deemed racist or &#8220;homophobic.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 10,000 of those children are in elementary school, and the figures even include nursery school students down to toddler age.</p>
<p>Schools were required by the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Labour government in 2002 to monitor and report all racist incidents to the local education authorities, or LEAs, following the U.K.&rsquo;s Race Relations Act of 2000.</p>
<p>London&rsquo;s Daily Mail reports many of the LEAs also require schools to report &#8220;homophobic&#8221; incidents and keep the offending students&rsquo; names in a register. The record can then follow the student into higher grades, or even to another school at the request of the new school&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>Following last year&rsquo;s publicized case of 10-year-old Peter Drury  &mdash;  who was added to his school&rsquo;s hate register for calling his friend &#8220;gay boy&#8221;  &mdash;  Dr. Michele Elliott of the charity Kidscape told the Mail, &#8220;Children are being criminalized and singled out here from a very early age when they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be explained that [this behavior] is wrong,&#8221; added Margaret Morrissey, founder of the campaign group Parents Outloud. &#8220;But to keep a register that will haunt them for years to come is going far too far and is against all rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drury&rsquo;s mother told the paper of her son, &#8220;He doesn&rsquo;t even understand about the birds and the bees, so how can he be homophobic?&#8221;</p>
<p>The total number of children added to the hate registry was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the civil liberties group, the Manifesto Club, which plans to release a report on their findings.</p>
<p>Adrian Hart, the report&rsquo;s author, told the Mail, &#8220;I feel that childhood itself is under attack. It&rsquo;s absolutely the case that these policies misunderstand children quite profoundly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racist incident reporting generates the illusion of a problem with racism in Britain&rsquo;s schools by trawling the everyday world of playground banter, teasing, childish insults  &mdash;  the sort of things that every teacher knows happens out there in the playground,&#8221; Hart said.</p>
<p>Vernon Coaker, the U.K.&rsquo;s Minister of State for Schools and Learners at the time of Drury&rsquo;s registry, defended the hate crimes policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of schools already record incidents of bullying,&#8221; Coaker told the Mail. &#8220;However, we want to make sure that all schools have measures in place to prevent and tackle bullying and show they are taking it seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Manifesto Club reports 29,659 incidents were reported by schools to LEAs in England and Wales during the 2008-9 school year. Of those, 10,436 were at elementary schools and 41 at nursery schools.</p>
<p>And while 51 of the nearly 30,000 cases involved police, the majority of the &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;homophobic&#8221; spats, the Mail reports, involved a student merely calling another student &#8220;gay,&#8221; &#8220;white trash&#8221; or similar epithets.<br>

		<p>Lemmie guess&hellip;.at the predominately non-white schools, anyone who says &#8220;sharia will rule the world&#8221; gets put on the &#8220;hate list&#8221; too. </p>
<p>Everyone knows the Muslims are not homophobic, in Iran they have none because they are killed out of hand. No, sir. Nothing homophobic about Islam. (Snicker)<br>

<p><br>
Somehow I dont think using the words &#8220;white trash&#8221; will land anyone on a &#8220;hate crimes list&#8221;. Especially in the most politically corret nation on the planet. </p>

<p>Merely?  Oh, tut tut!  It&rsquo;s nothing at all, is it? </p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think that everything is proper material for the police, but there should still be some standards of civility being enforced by the school. And taunting or harassing another student with such  &#8220;mere&#8221; &#8220;epithets&#8221; should be considered unacceptable. Parents do not send their children to school to be abused or bullied by others. And children should not have to put up with it either. Who else will protect them, if not the school authorities. </p>
<p>But keeping ledgers and such records is going too far to the other extreme. Why can&rsquo;t they find a happy medium?  When I went to school, manners and deportment were taught without police registers and government enforcement, and bullying was not allowed. These are police state tactics. Perhaps they are made necessary by the presence of so much  diversity?</p>

		<p>Why are the parents not stepping forward to curtail this obscene sexualization of children. The school has no business broaching the subject of sex. Are there no parochial schools in England?</p>

<p>Are there homosexuals in early elementary shool? <br>
Kids grow up fast these days!</p>
<p>Wow&hellip;the adult that dreamed up a &#8216;hate register&rsquo; for children that call each other names must be the most purile anti-person of modern times. Hold on, there&rsquo;s a large organisation of these like-minded people, they are collectively called the Labour party. I suppose the new government supports this too?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m probably misreading this but during the 1970&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s in the US there was a big deal made about sexual harassment or making compliments to women or perhaps being the wrong person even talking to women. Is this really about hate-crimes? Or is it about girls being able to take up with whatever boy of whatever age they want to and labeling anyone who might object to the whole thing a &#8216;hater&rsquo;? Again, perhaps I&rsquo;m reading it wrong but certainly none of us think this has anything to do with stopping hate crimes against white students. This kind of attention, the way it&rsquo;s spun/taught, always seems to have the dual effect of causing these kinds of &#8216;crimes&rsquo; against white and keeping whites shut up about it or not even noticing.  </p>

		<p>Yes because we know that, a white child making a gay joke is far more homophobic than Muslims who stone them without second thought. However, I doubt this will get them on the hate crime list.</p>

		<p>White British Kid calls out SWA&rsquo; kid to a fisticuffs over nothing.  SWA Kid gets hammer and big brother, comes back to school _in a car_ and leaves White British Kid brain damaged while his mother screams &#8216;Why didn&rsquo;t someone make the brownskinned victim feel less threatened!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I &#8216;kid&rsquo; you not.</p>
<p>This is what growing up in the third world does to speed along the viciousness of an already backwards cultural outlook and inbred genetics as a mindset of total conquest and immediate escalation to lethal violence.</p>
<p>But hey, at least we know they didn&rsquo;t call each other /nasty names/.  For that offense would&rsquo;ve certainly sent them up before the Bobby&rsquo;s as registered haters for life!</p>
<p>England will lose her cultural majority in the early 2060s, even if she turns off the torrent tomorrow.  Breeding rates and socialized medical coverage, along with no safe havens for whites by tax base or armed majority, ensure that.</p>
<p>Compared to that reality, the chances that a kid who doesn&rsquo;t make PM because of something in his elementary school record doesn&rsquo;t really mean much, no matter what the skin color of the offender.  Or his present age.</p>
<p>England is forked-done folks.  It has been for a long time.</p>
