<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Over the past few weeks, Andrew Fraser, an associate professor in the department of public law at Macquarie University, has advocated his views from a number of public platforms. He has claimed, among other things, that Africans are congenitally inferior in terms of their intellectual capacity and naturally prone to violence. He has exhorted Australians to stop further African and Asian migration to Australia, as he believes this nation is at risk of what he terms &ldquo;national suicide&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the flurry of media coverage that Fraser&rsquo;s views have received, his supporters and many of his critics have sought to legitimise his views by accommodating them under the rubric of free speech. Free speech, like motherhood, is held to be one of the inalienable truths of Australian society. As a community of academics, scholars and educators, we wish to make these essential points about the ethics and limits of free speech: </p>
<p>* The freedom to speak is not absolute. Racism, specifically in the form of racial vilification of particular groups, is not free speech. It is proscribed by law and cannot be sanctioned in any quarter. </p>
<p>* Some people are freer to speak than others. Free speech is not an abstraction. In practice it is exercised by some and not by others. The freedom to speak is enjoyed by those who have access &mdash; through linguistic, educational, institutional and economic power &mdash; to the various forums that disseminate or silence our speech. Witness the number of column centimetres that Fraser and his supporters have received, in contrast to the fewer than a handful of articles in which the communities he racially vilifies have had the opportunity to respond. </p>
<p>It is dishonest to suggest that free speech is equally available to all. Some of us are entrusted with the ability to speak authoritatively, and to be listened to, because of the roles we occupy in society. This is why it is imperative for other academics to denounce Fraser&rsquo;s continuing capitalisation on his academic title and institutional affiliation. Fraser has no academic research history in the field of race and ethnicity studies. </p>
<p>* As much as sticks and stones, words break bones. Sudanese-Australians have been bashed and attacked. In Toowoomba, in southeastern Queensland, a Sudanese-Australian family was driven out of town by repeated assaults from a neo-Nazi gang. The gang has warned that it will intensify its race-hate campaign (The Australian, July 23). </p>
<p>* Free speech is not a matter for the individual alone. We can see the limitations of this position as soon as we place students, largely ignored in the debate, at the centre of the issue. We are not just dealing with the sentiments of an individual but with the practices of a figure who exercises power and authority, vested in him by an institution, over students. His assessments help to determine their life chances in the future as well as their capacity to learn effectively in the present. How does a person who believes that people are unequally genetically endowed with intelligence and a capacity for violence undertake to fairly and equally assess students who come from different parts of the world? If a teacher holds such views, how can they treat students fairly on the basis of merit? </p>
<p>* It is timely to begin to talk about an ethics of speech founded on principles of responsibility and accountability. An ethics of speech demands that as speakers we take responsibility for unequal relations of power and resources, such as those that mark the relationship between a university professor and Sudanese refugees fleeing violence, poverty and persecution. </p>
<p>If free speech is not to become the last refuge for race fanatics and hate-mongers, in the context of an already volatile climate, it needs to be articulated hand-in-hand with an ethics of responsibility. Join us in denouncing the travesty of a free speech free of ethics.</p>
