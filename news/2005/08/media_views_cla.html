<h1>Media Views: Claiborne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Racist&rdquo; Label Sparks Controversy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Caesar, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Aug. 13</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This week, the controversy has moved to sports-talk radio station KFNS, as afternoon drive-time co-host Mike Claiborne had a contentious interview with Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller &mdash; with Feller hanging up after Claiborne called him a racist. Later, when discussing the incident, Claiborne used an expletive in describing Feller. </p>
<p>Feller, 86, was on the show Wednesday, discussing his baseball career and his days in the military. He then was asked by co-host Kevin Slaten to address what is right and wrong with baseball today.</p>
<p>Feller talked about players not knowing the fundamentals, then said, &ldquo;A lot of the players coming from the Caribbean, they don&rsquo;t even know the rules.&rdquo; He continued by discussing how hype and entertainment, including music and manufactured noise, have become commonplace at modern ballparks. </p>
<p>Claiborne then interrupted, asking Feller to clarify his comment about Caribbean players &mdash; which came in the same week a talk-show host in San Francisco was fired for talking about &ldquo;brain-dead Caribbean hitters hacking at slop nightly.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Several times, Claiborne asked Feller to specifically explain which rules he was talking about. Feller became irritated with Claiborne trying to pin him down and finally said, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t be quiet, I&rsquo;m going to cut this off.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Claiborne shot back, &ldquo;You can cut it off right now as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, you racist.&rdquo; Feller hung up. </p>
<p>In an interview, Claiborne said he had no regrets about using the word &ldquo;racist.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;For the most part, I understood where he was coming from regarding how the game is being marketed and things of that nature,&rdquo; Claiborne said. &ldquo;But when he says the Caribbean players don&rsquo;t even know the rules, that raises a flag&hellip; .   So I said, &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; He didn&rsquo;t want to address it. I tried to politely ask him, I wasn&rsquo;t trying to hang him out to dry. I&rsquo;ve been doing this for 25 years. That&rsquo;s not how I do business. He got offended by it, but I said what I said and I stand by it. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A while after Feller hug up, Claiborne referred on the air to Feller as an &ldquo;asshole.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret that, because that&rsquo;s not something I condone on the air,&rdquo; Claiborne said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a word that&rsquo;s been used on radio stations before, I&rsquo;ve just never used it and that&rsquo;s the one thing I regret &mdash; that I said that. I was not necessarily angry with Bob Feller but more disappointed that a guy of his stature would have such an attitude about this subject. And the way he ended the interview I think was more disappointment &mdash; he just hung up. So I regret saying it, although I don&rsquo;t know if I regret thinking it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>KFNS (590 AM, 100.7 FM) program director Rob Weingarten said no discipline is planned. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mike&rsquo;s emotions were genuine,&rdquo; he said in reference to the &ldquo;racist&rdquo; label. &ldquo;You can never fault genuine emotion. That&rsquo;s Mike&rsquo;s belief. If he&rsquo;s comfortable with calling him that, I haven&rsquo;t got a problem with it whether I agree with him or not.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But Weingarten was unhappy about the expletive. </p>
