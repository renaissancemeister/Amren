<h1>&lsquo;White Flight&rsquo; From Hearne Ruled Illegal</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Craig Kapitan, Bryan-College Station Eagle (Tex.), Aug. 9</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of students who have transferred from Hearne to the Mumford Independent School District will have to go home to reverse an illegal &ldquo;white flight&rdquo; trend that has segregated the districts, according to a ruling delivered out of a federal court in Tyler last week.</p>
<p>In the 110-page document, Senior U.S. District Court Judge William Wayne Justice described Mumford as maintaining a &ldquo;pattern of fraudulent conduct&rdquo; in past years as it solicited transfers from Hearne, increasing its enrollment of white students over a 10-year period by 3,540 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hearne desegregated its schools in the 1970s as a result of No.5281, but white families remained reluctant to send their children to a formerly all-black school in a predominantly black area of town, the judge wrote, citing testimony from Morris McDaniel, who retired in 2002 as the town&rsquo;s first black superintendent.</p>
<p>In response, he continued, the school district began an &ldquo;ability grouping&rdquo; plan where students were divided among two elementary schools separated into lower ability and higher ability classes. The result was a resegregation of the schools.</p>
<p>After an accreditation by the TEA in 1990, however, the district dropped the plan. Hearne&rsquo;s overall enrollment of white students began declining each year after, while Mumford&rsquo;s population began a steady ascent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearne parents started transferring their children in earnest around 1991 or 1992,&rdquo; Justice wrote. &ldquo;Even Hearne school board members transferred their children out of [formerly all black] Blackshear [Elementary School].</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the leaders of Hearne, these members&rsquo; decisions to transfer their children raised serious questions in the community about their school district and exacerbated the transfer problem for Hearne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between 1990 and 2000 Hearne&rsquo;s white enrollment decreased by 68 percent. Meanwhile, Mumford&rsquo;s population of white students grew by 3,540 percent during that same time period.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As a result, he wrote, Hearne now is perceived as a black school district, creating negative and unsubstantiated stereotypes concerning the safety of students.</p>
