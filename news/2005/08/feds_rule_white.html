<h1>Feds Rule &#147;White Pride&#148; is &#147;Offensive&#148; and &#147;Immoral&#148;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Justin J. Moritz, <em><strong>AR News exclusive</strong></em>, Aug. 2</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you are looking for more evidence that the United States government is biased against white people, you can add their decision in my trademark case. In February, 2004, I applied for a trademark on the words &#147;White Pride Country Wide.&#148; I did it as an exercise against political correctness. I intentionally did not choose &#147;white power,&#148; &#147;white supremacy&#148; or &#147;the white race&#148; because of the negative connotations of those terms. Trademarks can be denied to offensive phrases. </p>
<p>When I later searched United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) records, I found that &#147;Black Power,&#148; &#147;Black Supremacy,&#148; and &#147;La Raza&#148; (Spanish for &#147;The Race&#148;) had all been approved by the USPTO and been found not to be offensive. The USPTO had also approved and registered &#147;The Black Panther Party&#148; and &#147;Burn, Baby, Burn,&#148; the party&rsquo;s slogan. The Black Panthers had assassinated white police officers but neither term was found to be offensive or immoral. To me, &#147;white pride&#148; was a non-offensive, positive term, or at least I thought so. </p>
<p>On December 23, 2004, I received my Christmas present from the USPTO. In an Office Action prepared by Barbara Rutland, it denied my trademark, ruling that the &#147;white pride&#148; part of my request was &#147;offensive,&#148; &#147;immoral,&#148; and &#147;scandalous.&#148; Here are her very words: </p>
<p>&#147;Section 2(a) Refusal</p>
<p>&#147;Registration is refused because the proposed mark consists of or comprises immoral or scandalous matter. Trademark Act Section 2(a) U.S.C. 1052(a); TMEP 1203.01. According to the attached evidence from a Lexis/Nexis database and a search of the Internet using the search engine <a href="http://www.google.com/">www.google.com</a>, the &#147;WHITE PRIDE&#148; element of the proposed mark is considered offensive and therefore scandalous.&#148; </p>
<p>My Appeal </p>
<p>On January 1, 2005, I decided to appeal the USPTO decision, but not before doing some research. I found that that the following &#147;pride&#148; terms have all been registered as trademarks by the U.S Government: </p>
<p>&#147;African Pride,&#148; &#147;African Man Pride,&#148; &#147;Asian Pride,&#148; &#147;Bahama Pride,&#148; &#147;Black Pride,&#148; &#147;Brazilian Pride,&#148; &#147;China-Pride,&#148; &#147;Chippewa Pride,&#148; &#147;Choctaw Pride,&#148; &#147;Colombian Pride,&#148; &#147;Cuban Pride,&#148; &#147;Dakota Pride,&#148; &#147;Dominican Pride,&#148; &#147;El Salvador Pride,&#148; &#147;Ecuador Pride,&#148; &#147;Gay Pride Apparel,&#148; &#147;Guyanese Pride,&#148; &#147;Havana Pride,&#148; &#147;Honduran Pride,&#148; &#147;Indian Pride,&#148; &#147;Jamaica&rsquo;s Pride,&#148; &#147;Jewish Pride,&#148; &#147;Kwanzaa Pride,&#148; &#147;Long Beach Lesbian and Gay Pride,&#148; &#147;Mayan Pride,&#148; &#147;Mexican Pride,&#148; &#147;Native Pride!,&#148; &#147;Nicaraguan Pride,&#148; &#147;Orgullo Hispano&#148; (Hispanic Pride), &#147;Orgoglio&#148; (Hispanic&mdash;&rsquo;Great Pride&rsquo; (supremacy?)), &#147;Qisqueya Pride&#148; (Dominican Republic Pride), &#147;Rainbow Pride Coach,&#148; &#147;Red Pride,&#148; &#147;San Diego Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride,&#148; &#147;Spanish Pride,&#148; and &#147;West Indian Pride.&#148; </p>
<p>The factual evidence for my appeal was overwhelming, or at least I thought so. It seemed as though the federal government wanted everybody to have pride, except white people. It seemed to be a clear case of discrimination. </p>
<p>USPTO denies appeal </p>
<p>In February 2005, the USPTO issued their &#147;FINAL OFFICE ACTION.&#148; It was again prepared by Barbara Rutland. The USPTO upheld its original denial, explaining: </p>
<p>&#147;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. prior decisions and actions of other trademark examining attorneys in registering different marks are without evidentiary value (emphasis added) and are not binding upon the Office.&#148; </p>
<p>In plain English, the USPTO was saying that their own records cannot be used against it. Imagine a taxpayer being audited by the IRS. Could he sit back and say, &#147;Go ahead, audit me, but you can&rsquo;t use my records against me&#148;? </p>
<p>I lost my $1,300 non-refundable trademark application fee. </p>
<p>ACLU denies assistance and adds insult </p>
<p>My next step was to seek outside help from the Minnesota branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). I sent a brief letter to the ACLU-MN summarizing my case and asking if they were interested. They initially said they were willing to review the case, so I sent them pages of documentation. I thought I might have a chance since the ACLU prides itself on defending the rights of the little guy. I am white, male, heterosexual, married, employed, native born, English speaking, Christian-valued, have no criminal record, and am a retired law enforcement officer. I could be the perfect &#147;token&#148; case outside their mainstream clientele, or at least I thought so. </p>
<p>In March 2005, the ACLU not only turned my case down but took the opportunity to slam white people and Christians. Renee Hamilton, legal assistant for the ACLU-MN, wrote: </p>
<p>&#147;Thus, when the PTO examined Moritz&rsquo;s mark, their rejection of his mark was reasonable given that such a slogan has just but one meaning i.e. superiority of what he term (sic) &lsquo;the white race&rsquo; over all other races and their brand of Christianity over the other religions.&#148; </p>
<p>The ACLU was fully aware of all the other &#147;pride&#148; trademarks I had listed in my documents. If a &#147;pride&#148; trademark had been turned down for any group of people, other than whites, the ACLU would be in court screaming &#147;Discrimination by the United States Government!&#148; </p>
<p>Center for Individual Rights (CIR) provides assistance </p>
<p>My next step was to seek help from the Center for Individual Rights. They are the conservative response to the ACLU. They are political opposites but much smaller than the ACLU. I corresponded with the CIR through mail, email, and telephone conversations. In June 2005, the CIR politely and professionally declined my request for help, but because of monetary, not ideological considerations. </p>
<p>The CIR did help by putting my case on the Federalist website, a conservative site where attorneys can take pro bono cases. As of August 2005, I had not received any responses. </p>
<p>You can help </p>
<p>The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right of the people to &#147;petition the government for a redress of grievances.&#148; If you disagree with the decision of the USPTO in my case, please petition the government. </p>
