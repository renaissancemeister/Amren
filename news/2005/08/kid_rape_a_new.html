<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nelspruit &mdash; Two child rapists were handed life sentences in the Nelspruit circuit of Pretoria High Court on Wednesday. </p>
<p>Sonnyboy Mathe, 40, of Komatipoort in Mpumalanga raped an eight-year-old girl while her mother lay in a drunken sleep next to her on February 13 2004. </p>
<p>He was staying with the girl&rsquo;s mother and the girl slept in the same bed as the couple. </p>
<p>When her mother woke up the next morning, the child told her what had happened. </p>
<p>Her mother took her to a local clinic where the rape was confirmed. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This court has handled more than five rape cases in the last 14 days. I do not know whether all you men are suffering from the same disease, or if it is just fashionable to sleep with minors,&rdquo; said Judge Roger Claasens. </p>
<p>He said he would be failing in his duty if he did not sentence Mathe to life in jail. </p>
<p>Showed no remorse for crime </p>
<p>In a separate case, Judge Claasens also jailed David Khoza, 26, for life for raping a nine-year-old girl on October 18 2004 at Msogwaba near Nelspruit. </p>
<p>Khoza insisted on his innocence, which angered the judge. </p>
<p>Judge Claasens noted that although Khoza was a first offender, he had showed no remorse for his crime. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You choose not to be aware that the dignity of the victim has been violated. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You are saying, in fact, all the evidence against you is fabricated. You will spend the rest of your life in jail,&rdquo; he said.</p>
