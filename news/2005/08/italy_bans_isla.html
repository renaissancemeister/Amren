<h1>Italy Bans Islamic Burqas</h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Natasha Bita, Australian (Sydney), Aug. 1</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Italy has banned Islamic burqas under tough terrorism laws that provide two-year jail terms and E2000 ($3200) fines for anyone caught covering their face in a public place.</p>
<p>The counter-terrorism package, passed by Italy&rsquo;s parliament yesterday, doubles the existing penalty for wearing a burqa or chador &mdash; traditional robes worn by Muslim women to cover their faces &mdash; or full-faced helmets or balaclavas in public. </p>
<p>Police can extract DNA samples without a suspect&rsquo;s consent, detain them for 24 hours without a lawyer present, and deport foreigners suspected of terrorism under the new legislation. Soldiers involved in counter-terrorism have been given the same stop-and-search powers. </p>
<p>The changes, approved in a rare show of bipartisanship, came as Italian police arrested a fugitive hunted by British police over the bungled bombing attempt in London on July 21. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In the course of the investigation, it has been possible to identify a dense network of individuals from the Eritrean and Ethiopian communities in Italy, believed to have helped the fugitive cover his tracks,&rdquo; Italian Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisanu told the Senate. &ldquo;We have before us a grave threat that has to be confronted with all the means of prevention and contrast that we have.&rdquo; Italian media yesterday reported that the suspected terrorist, named by British police as Somali-born Hussain Osman, was Hamdi Adus Issac, 27, born in Ethiopia and allegedly granted British citizenship using false Somali documents. </p>
<p>Osman, who reportedly lived in Rome for several years and speaks fluent Italian, is fighting Britain&rsquo;s extradition request via a European arrest warrant. He slipped through Britain&rsquo;s security dragnet last week by catching a train from London&rsquo;s Waterloo station to Paris. He then moved to Milan and Rome, where Italian police arrested him during a raid on a relative&rsquo;s apartment. They had been tracking him by monitoring his mobile phone. </p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s biggest newspapers reported that Osman had admitted to his Italian police interrogator that he had carried a bomb on to a train in his backpack. </p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s opposition leader, former European Commission president Romano Prodi, yesterday pledged to withdraw Italy&rsquo;s 3000 troops from Iraq if his centre-left coalition wins elections due by June next year. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We will withdraw them as a occupying force because our job will be to aid in the reconstruction of Iraq,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi &mdash; who has said Italy will progressively withdraw its troops starting in September &mdash; accused his rival of putting Italian soldiers&rsquo; lives at risk by defining them as &ldquo;occupying&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s breaking Western solidarity, justifying and enticing attacks against our troops,&rdquo; Mr Berlusconi said. </p>
<p>Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini accused Mr Prodi of exposing Italy to a terrorist attack.</p>
