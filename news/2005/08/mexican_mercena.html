<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A renegade band of Mexican military deserters, offering $50,000 bounties for the assassination of U.S. law-enforcement officers, has expanded its base of operations into the United States to protect loads of cocaine and marijuana being brought into America by Mexican smugglers, authorities said. </p>
<p>The deserters, known as the &ldquo;Zetas,&rdquo; trained in the United States as an elite force of anti-drug commandos, but have since signed on as mercenaries for Mexican narcotics traffickers and have recruited an army of followers, many of whom are believed to be operating in Texas, Arizona, California and Florida. </p>
<p>Working mainly for the Gulf Cartel, one of Mexico&rsquo;s most dangerous drug-trafficking organizations, as many as 200 Zeta members are thought to be involved, including former Mexican federal, state and local police. They are suspected in more than 90 deaths of rival gang members and others, including police officers, in the past two years in a violent drug war to control U.S. smuggling routes. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Authorities said the Zetas operate over a wide area of the U.S.-Mexico border and are suspected in at least three drug-related slayings in the Dallas area. They said as many as 10 Zeta members are operating inside Texas as Gulf Cartel assassins, seeking to protect nearly $10 million in daily drug transactions. </p>
<p>In March, the Justice Department said the Zetas were involved &ldquo;in multiple assaults and are believed to have hired criminal gangs&rdquo; in the Dallas area for contract killings. The department said the organization was spreading from Texas to California and Florida and was establishing drug-trafficking routes it was willing to protect &ldquo;at any cost.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Just last month, the department issued a new warning to law-enforcement authorities in Arizona and California, urging them to be on the lookout for Zeta members. An intelligence bulletin said a search for new drug-smuggling routes in the two states by the organization could bring new violence to the areas. </p>
<p>The number of assaults on U.S. Border Patrol agents along the 260 miles of U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona known as the Tucson sector has increased dramatically this year, including a May 30 shooting near Nogales, Ariz., in which two agents were seriously wounded during an ambush a mile north of the border. </p>
<p>Their assailants were dressed in black commando-type clothing, used high-powered weapons and hand-held radios to point out the agents&rsquo; location, and withdrew from the area using military-style cover and concealment tactics to escape back into Mexico. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Since Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, there have been 196 assaults on Border Patrol agents in the Tucson sector, including 24 shootings. During the same period last year, 92 assaults were reported, with five shootings. The sector is the busiest alien &mdash; and drug-trafficking corridor in the country. </p>
