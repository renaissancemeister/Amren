<h1>Delray Beach Officer Cleared in Fatal Shooting of Teen</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WPBFnews.com (West Palm Beach), Aug. 21</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><span class="caps">DELRAY BEACH,</span> Fla. &mdash; A police officer who shot and killed a Delray Beach teenager won&rsquo;t face criminal charges. </p>
<p>A grand jury ruled Wednesday that the shooting was justified. </p>
<p>With the announcement, two days of grand jury testimony came to an end, and Delray Beach Police Officer Darren Cogoni was cleared in the shooting death of Jarrod Miller, 16. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cogoni, a rookie officer, has been on paid administrative leave since the February shooting. He was working a security detail at the Delray Beach Full Service Center when Miller, who didn&rsquo;t have a license, drove erratically toward a group of students at a school dance. </p>
<p>Cogoni fired two shots. One struck miller in the head. In April, a judge at a public inquest suggested Cogoni be charged with manslaughter. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Palm Beach County Commissioner Addie Greene said the shooting was, and still is, a racial issue. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We can no longer stand here now and expect the system to work for us,&rdquo; Greene said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no longer going to ask my young black men to be passive. I&rsquo;ll no longer ask young black men, &lsquo;When you see law enforcement, run, or put your hands in your pockets.&rsquo; No. (Now, the message is), &lsquo;Go where there&rsquo;s the biggest crowd you can find,&rsquo; because if he doesn&rsquo;t he will be killed.&rdquo; </p>

<div class="title">Greene Defiant as Officers Call for Her to Quit</div>
<p><em>Deana Poole, Palm Beach Post, Aug. 23</em></p>
<p><span class="caps">WEST PALM BEACH</span> &mdash; About 60 members of the county&rsquo;s police union called for Commissioner Addie Greene&rsquo;s resignation Monday, angered by remarks she made after a grand jury cleared a Delray Beach officer in the shooting death of 16-year-old Jerrod Miller.</p>
<p>At a news conference, Greene was met by members of the Palm Beach County Police Benevolent Association who said she was &ldquo;preaching hate,&rdquo; was a racist and was disrespectful to members of law enforcement. They wore T-shirts that said &ldquo;Addie Must Resign,&rdquo; shouted comments and chanted &ldquo;Resign. Resign. Resign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterward, Greene flatly rejected their demands and said their behavior was rude and disrespectful: &ldquo;The only thing they left at home was the sheet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Members of the Police Benevolent Association, politically powerful in local and state elections, say they have a problem with an elected official encouraging black youth who are approached by officers to &ldquo;run and find the biggest crowd of people. If he doesn&rsquo;t, he will be killed.&rdquo; Greene made the statement to The Palm Beach Post and other news media last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your arrogance disgusts me. I&rsquo;ll tell you that right now,&rdquo; shouted one officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my press conference, sir, and you are disrespecting me,&rdquo; Greene said. &ldquo;You are disrespecting me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another officer chimed in: &ldquo;Your views are extremely distorted. And I&rsquo;m glad that you got up before everybody here and admitted that your comments are racially motivated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda Johnson, area director for the <span class="caps">NAACP, </span>spoke to the crowd: &ldquo;Why do we want to investigate the messenger, and not the message? What we&rsquo;re failing to realize is there is a message here. If there is a concern regarding our youth and our local community, that&rsquo;s something we need to address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you all to understand that we have a great concern here and it&rsquo;s the message,&rdquo; Johnson said.</p>
<p>An officer in the crowd asked: &ldquo;Addie Greene&rsquo;s racist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnson replied: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kazanjian apologized for his &ldquo;Boston accent.&rdquo; But it only got worse. Further exchanges between officers and the black leaders included:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hate white people, that&rsquo;s the bottom line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kill black children.&rdquo;</p>
