<h1><a href="https://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1761552005">US Reporter Killed &lsquo;Because He Was To Marry A Muslim&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fraser Nelson, Scotsman (Edinburgh), Aug. 11</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An American journalist who was shot dead in Basra last week was executed by Shiite extremists who knew he was intending to marry his Muslim interpreter, it has emerged. </p>
<p>Steven Vincent was shot a week before the planned wedding to Nouriya Itais and had already delivered a $2,500 dowry to her family. </p>
<p>The disclosure casts new light on the grip of Islamic religious sects in the British-run south &mdash; east of Iraq &mdash; raising concern that they will take control once troops start to withdraw. Mr Vincent was abducted from his hotel three days after writing a piece in the New York Times accusing British officials of allowing religious parties to infiltrate the Basra police. </p>
<p>In America, his death was taken as retribution for his article. But in London yesterday, British officials pointed out that the police in Basra believed it was retribution for his affair. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We warned him to look after his security in a more professional manner than he was doing,&rdquo; said the official. </p>
<p>The couple were found by Iraqi police after being shot by their captors. Medics managed to save Ms Itais.</p>
