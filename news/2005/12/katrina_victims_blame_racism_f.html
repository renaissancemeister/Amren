<h1><a href="https://msnbc.msn.com/id/10354221/">Katrina Victims Blame Racism for Slow Aid</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, Dec. 6, 2005</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; Black survivors of Hurricane Katrina said Tuesday that racism contributed to the slow disaster response, at times likening themselves in emotional congressional testimony to victims of genocide and the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The comparison is inappropriate, according to Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla. &ldquo;Not a single person was marched into a gas chamber and killed,&rdquo; Miller told the survivors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They died from abject neglect,&rdquo; retorted community activist Leah Hodges. &ldquo;We left body bags behind &hellip;  The people of New Orleans were stranded in a flood and were allowed to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry evacuees described being trapped in temporary shelters where one New Orleans resident said she was &ldquo;one sunrise from being consumed by maggots and flies.&rdquo; Another woman said military troops focused machine gun laser targets on her granddaughter&rsquo;s forehead. Others said their families were called racial epithets by police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is going to tell me it wasn&rsquo;t a race issue,&rdquo; said New Orleans evacuee Patricia Thompson, 53, who is now living in College Station, Texas. &ldquo;Yes, it was an issue of race. Because of one thing: when the city had pretty much been evacuated, the people that were left there mostly was black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to a recent Gallup poll, NBC News&rsquo; Kerry Sanders reported on Tuesday, six out of every 10 black New Orleans residents said if most of Katrina&rsquo;s victims were white, relief would have arrived sooner. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not all lawmakers seemed persuaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be offensive when you&rsquo;ve gone though such incredible challenges,&rdquo; said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn. But referring to some of the victims&rsquo; charges, like the gun pointed at the girl, Shays said: &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t frankly believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe what you want,&rdquo; Thompson said.</p>
<p>Shays also questioned a claim that the federal government unleashed this tragedy on New Orleans&rsquo; black residents on purpose. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was on my front porch,&rdquo; Diane Cole French said at the hearings. &ldquo;I have witnesses that they bombed the walls of the levee.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s theater or the truth,&rdquo; Shays responded. </p>
