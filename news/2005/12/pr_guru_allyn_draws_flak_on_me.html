<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>MEXICO CITY &mdash; Dallas public relations guru Rob Allyn barely had finalized a contract with the Mexican government to improve its image stateside when he found himself face to face in prime time with his clients&rsquo; toughest critics. </p>
<p>They include Fox News&rsquo; Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, who predicted a long year and tough sell for Mr. Allyn, a longtime Bush family adviser who helped George W. Bush beat Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. </p>
<p>Mr. Allyn, who kept his role in the 2000 presidential campaign of Vicente Fox a secret until Mr. Fox&rsquo;s victory, said Thursday that he&rsquo;s ready to defend Mexico as a reliable neighbor that does not deserve the new border fences that would come with an immigration bill now making its way through the U.S. Congress. </p>
<p>So far, Mr. Allyn said, his questioners have been fair-minded even in some rough venues. Of Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly, who would like to see the U.S. military on the border to stem illegal immigration, Mr. Allyn said: &ldquo;He was interested, he was listening.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Already, in just the few days since the one-year, $720,000 contract was announced by Mexico&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry, reactions to Mr. Allyn&rsquo;s role have been intense, divided and plentiful. </p>
<p> &ldquo;The phones have been ringing off the hook, and [there&rsquo;s] the hate e-mail,&rdquo; said Mr. Allyn. &ldquo;We have a lot of people who question your patriotism.&rdquo; </p>
<p>On the flip side, he said, his office has received phone calls from business leaders, politicians and others from California to Texas to New York applauding his promotion of Mexico as a great business partner. </p>
<p>This latest assignment, Mr. Allyn said, is more than just another business contract. </p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, on a personal level, this is a dream assignment,&rdquo; said Mr. Allyn, who heads Allyn &amp; Co., which is owned by the Fleishman-Hillard public relations group. &ldquo;I have gotten so tired of the way people treat Mexico. I believe in the cause, so I love the opportunity to share my views. I&rsquo;ve held these views for a long time. I relish the opportunity to help in some small way.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Not a newcomer </p>
<p>Mr. Allyn said he has made more than 100 trips to Mexico over the last decade and knows what he&rsquo;s talking about. Since helping Mr. Fox become the first Mexican president from an opposition party in 71 years, Mr. Allyn has served as a political consultant to three gubernatorial candidates from Mr. Fox&rsquo;s National Action Party. All have won, he said. </p>
<p>Other clients of Mr. Allyn&rsquo;s Mexico-related consulting include American Airlines and Bank of America. </p>
<p>Under Mr. Fox, Mr. Allyn said, Mexico has become more democratic and less corrupt, and it is the United States&rsquo; second-largest trade partner in the world. The U.S. sells $111 billion in goods to Mexico every year, he said. But many Americans don&rsquo;t know that. Yet. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Periodically, in the U.S. and elsewhere, the pendulum swings &hellip; in the way we view our neighbors,&rdquo; said Mr. Allyn. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s all the more important to stay calm and do what&rsquo;s right when things turn hysterical.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe when people understand how important business with Mexico is, the U.S., people in North America will want to build bridges to Mexico, not walls,&rdquo; he added. Mr. Allyn&rsquo;s contract also includes promoting Mexico in Canada. </p>
<p>A bill passed by the U.S. House last week would toughen penalties for undocumented workers and employers who hire them. It also would fund more walls along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. </p>
<p>It does not include a provision, favored by President Bush, to expand a guest worker program to allow more Mexicans to work legally in the U.S. </p>
<p>Mr. Allyn said such a temporary-worker program would be a step toward making immigration &ldquo;safe and legal and orderly and controlled.&rdquo; Immigrants are a valuable source of labor to the U.S., he added. </p>
