<p><font size="3"><p>Arizona&rsquo;s immigrant population reached 851,000 in March, with an estimated 46 percent of that number here illegally, according to a report based on new Census Bureau data. </p>
<p>The report released Monday by the Center for Immigration Studies also found that Arizona has one of the nation&rsquo;s largest disparities in terms of educational levels between its native-born and immigrant populations, with poorly educated immigrants languishing. </p>
<p>Forty percent of immigrants &mdash; but only 7 percent of natives &mdash; have not finished high school, ranking Arizona third worst in that category behind Texas and Colorado, said Steven Camarota, the Washington-based center&rsquo;s research director. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Camarota said he believes illegal immigrants have become such a hot issue in Arizona because of the educational disparities. &ldquo;If they were more educated, I think it would be less of an issue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The differences between the two groups (immigrants and native-born) are so big it creates enormous social distance.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nearly 47 percent of immigrants and 40 percent of natives without a high school diploma are on a welfare program as opposed to under 13 percent of college-educated immigrants and just 6 percent of natives. </p>
<p>And 58 percent of Arizona&rsquo;s immigrants &mdash; legal and illegal &mdash; live in or near poverty, with 28 percent actually in poverty.</p></font>

<p>Makes perfect sense really. Let&rsquo;s dump a few hundred million taxpayer dollars into the Arizona educational system.

Well, maybe if the Pedros and Joses didn&rsquo;t send so much back home they wouldn&rsquo;t be so poor.

  <font size="3"><p>Fed up, you have to remember, even those numbers are grossly distorted. This is the administration which decided that fast food and other restaurant jobs are &#8220;manufacturing&#8221; positions, and rigged the job numbers to show an increase in manufacturing that way.  That they did this with a straight face, knowing the big lie in how it was calculated, that is just pure hubris. </p>
<p><br/>
I haven&rsquo;t been to Arizona, though I did live in neighboring New Mexico for a short time.  I was very unimpressed. Nothing but homeless, hookers, drunk indians, and illegals.   My personal estimate of the illegal population there is a little closer to 70-75 percent of immigrants there are illegal.  The effect of them, and I&rsquo;m told Arizona is a far bigger corridor than New Mexico, was to so depress wages that the standard of living - outside of those working for Intel and Sandia - was incredibly low. Most people I knew there were either actively falling, or quickly losing their ability to tread water, and this was in the 90&rsquo;s when the economy was in far better shape. </p>
<p>People often forget that there are a lot of &#8216;skilled&rsquo; trades that, while they may not require a college degree, are generally paying enough to be able to afford to live on. The business I was in at the time required a lot of contact with the printing industry. I never went into a printing company there that employed more than a token number of whites - with the exception of type setting, graphics, and plate making dept - 80-90% of the employees actually doing the work were illegals, most from Mexico. Jobs that would be 15-33 an hour here in Missouri, were 7-10 an hour there. It was the same in most construction &amp; transpotation as well.  The effect of having all of the illegals in the school system forced them to hold public school classes in trailers, they could not longer afford to build buildings for them.  </p>
<p>They say all of this &#8216;free trade&rsquo; is supposed to be good for everyone. But I look at those who have bought into it, and see what happens to their countries. They are all in a rapid race to the bottom with heavily declining standards of living, and currency that is depreciating at rates that make real purchasing power erode several times faster than wages, interest, and even very good investments in the market can compensate for. Only bright spot at the moment is metals, and only if you get the right ones in right forms. Metals aren&rsquo;t really a gainer, they are more of a place-holder for your assets, they tend to freeze in at the &#8216;real value&rsquo; of whatever you invested at the time, however, in an economy with a 60% drop in value of the dollar over a few years span, stagnant and actual declining wages, and a market performing nowhere near enough to make gains ahead of the falling dollar - a place holder isn&rsquo;t a bad move. </p>
<p>The illegals are just one more lead weight tied to the ankles of an economy without a life preserver. <br/>

<p>Mr. Salt   &mdash;   you are 100% right in your post. I live in Texas and nearly half of Hispanics in our state are illegals. My somewhat facetious comment re dumping millions into the educational system was hardly meant to be a serious solution.</p>
<p>Like most of our readers, I am keenly aware (even though not personnally impacted) by jobs going overseas (OUTSOURCING) or lost to low-paid illegals (INSOURCING). My concern is of course, the long-term impact of losing jobs through both means for our middle-class, specifically the lower-end workers   &mdash;   people from just above the official poverty line on upwards.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of insight to understand Black Afro-Americans are going to be hurt the hardest by the Hispanic influx, the next group being our low-level White wage-earners, most significantly recent high school grads who have to postpone college while dealing with the need to earn a living in the interim.</p>
<p>Our short-sighted <span class="caps">BIG BUSINESS </span>executives are selling out the lower end of our middle-class which ultimately puts a huge dent in <span class="caps">THEIR </span>purchasing power   &mdash;   something those aforementioned <span class="caps">CEO</span>s tend to think about later on   &mdash;   when domestic sales start a steady decline. (Your point about the printing industry is well-taken. I&rsquo;ve spent much of my working life in the printing industry (as typesetter, graphic artist, etc.) and heartily agree.</p>
<p>In Texas, there <span class="caps">ARE FEW</span> IF <span class="caps">ANY</span> White construction workers building homes and business structures   &mdash;   Why? because the short-sighted business owners hire two illegals for what a single White man would be paid. That the work is shoddy is something many homebuyers are finding out on a daily basis   &mdash;   but, the short-term profits to the construction company is what matters, right?</p>
<p>But we get the same line of baloney from President <span class="caps">G.W.B. </span>to the immigration advocates   &mdash;   They don&rsquo;t steal jobs. They don&rsquo;t depress wages. They pay taxes (that has to take some esoteric and arcane math to prove that claim). Shucks, you get the picture.</p>
<p>I personally hope <span class="caps">EVERY</span> AmRen reader has the good sense to scrutinize the record of their Senators, Congressmen and start evicting the talkers who tell us what we <span class="caps">WANT </span>to hear while doing the diametric opposite hoping we&rsquo;re too lazy to notice.</p></font><p>Posted 
  by <a href="mailto:hENRY3730@aol.com">Fed Up</a> at  4:50 PM on December 14</font> <div class="text-center"><img src="../../../../greyline.GIF" width="500" height="1"/> 
      <a id="c106580"></a>
  <font size="3"><p>The estimation of the number of illegals is most likely low.  In addition to all the negative social effects of such immigration and the tremendous costs which primarily white citizens must shoulder there is another aspect of illegal immigration which is often missed.</p>
<p>  As the census counts every person (not every citizen) for purposes of determining the number of house representatives alloted to a state, the presence of large numbers of illegals leads to an over-representation of such states.  Thus, although most illegals don&rsquo;t vote directly in our elections (or so the law stipulates at any rate), illegals and resident aliens are represented through the allotment of additional congressional seats due to their presence.  States which have the good fortune to have few illegals are penalized by the system and loose congressional representatives.</p>
<p>Thus illegals not only directly harm the country in numerous ways, they also function as a powerful lobby due to the ridiculous practice of counting illegals in the assignment of representatives in the house.  Only the most radical pro-immigrant groups could support such a state of affairs and yet it is the current system.  This could and should be changed by mandating that the census count only citizens for purposes of alloting the number of congressmen from a particular state.</p>
<p>The more one looks into the costs of illegal immigration, the size of the burden which it imposes grows.  Any policy which does not lead directly to the mass deportation of illegals will be woefully inadequate.  Yet what are the chances of such a policy being implimented?  Next to zero in my opinion.</p>
<p>We may well have come too far on the road to <span class="caps">CWII </span>to turn back.  For this we can thank the liberal democrats and their supporters in the media, the courts, the universities, the race lobbies, the &#8220;enviornmental movement&#8221;, the big business community and yes the neoconservatives who value free markets and open borders above all else  &mdash;  the anything for a buck crowd that currently runs the executive branch and has no loyalty to this country or its culture.</p></font><p>Posted
