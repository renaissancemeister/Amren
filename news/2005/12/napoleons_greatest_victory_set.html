<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Exactly 200 years after Napoleon&rsquo;s epoch-making victory at Austerlitz in central Europe, the French government has been accused of political correctness for failing to join commemorations for perhaps the most glorious battle in the country&rsquo;s military history. </p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin both chose to boycott Friday&rsquo;s evening&rsquo;s small parade to honour the anniversary at the Place Vendome in central Paris. And at yesterday&rsquo;s mass re-enactment of the battle in the modern-day Czech Republic, the only French representative was defence minister Michele Alliot-Marie, who made it clear she was there purely in a private capacity. </p>
<p>By contrast, critics pointed ironically to France&rsquo;s enthusiastic participation in joint ceremonies with Britain earlier this year to mark the bicentenary of the naval battle of Trafalgar &mdash; which was one of the nation&rsquo;s most crushing defeats. </p>
<p>Historians, editorialists and right-wing politicians have chastised the government for bowing to the fashion for &ldquo;self-flagellation&rdquo; and refusing to grant Napoleon&rsquo;s stunning defeat of the Austro-Russian alliance on December 2, 1805, its due place in history. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the duty of memory supposed to be selective?&rdquo; asked columnist Jean des Cars in the conservative Le Figaro. &ldquo;One can only wonder when the commemorations for Napoleon&rsquo;s most famous victory are marked with such painful discretion.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And France-Soir lamented: &ldquo;The truth is that it is not the done thing today to celebrate the victories of Napoleon, but Austerlitz does not just belong to its general-in-chief &hellip; The 9000 French soldiers who fell there died for their homeland, and did so while crushing a coalition of aristocrat nations bent on subjugating France and restoring the old order.&rdquo; </p>
<p>For Lionnel Luca, of Chirac&rsquo;s Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party, &ldquo;the worst of it is this modern trend for repentance at all costs&rdquo;, while his colleague Andre Santini said the absence of an official commemoration was &ldquo;a sign of a France in decline, a France which forgets its past&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Austerlitz is today recognised as the highpoint of Napoleon&rsquo;s military genius. Tricking the Austrian and Russian generals into thinking they had the strategic advantage, he brought his highly-disciplined grande arm√©e up against superior numbers and inflicted a stunning defeat &mdash; dealing a death blow to the Holy Roman Empire and hastening the genesis of modern Germany. </p>
<p>France&rsquo;s government &mdash; which includes in Villepin a leading Napoleon enthusiast &mdash; might have been expected to mark the battle if not as a feat of arms then at least as a key moment in the fashioning of modern Europe. Its reluctance to do so appears to be a response to growing sensitivity over the country&rsquo;s past, and to accusations from the left and anti-racist groups that negative aspects of both the Napoleonic and colonial periods have been airbrushed from the history books. </p>
<p>Given added spice by last month&rsquo;s rioting in France&rsquo;s immigrant-heavy suburbs, the row centres partly on a law passed by the National Assembly in February enjoining history teachers to stress the &ldquo;positive role of the French presence overseas, especially in north Africa&rdquo;. This has been attacked by the left as a blatant attempt to rewrite the past at the expense of black and Arab indigenous populations. </p>
<p>But at the same time a controversial book has put Napoleon himself in the firing line by charging him with racism . In The Crime Of Napoleon, Claude Ribbe says the emperor was a genocidal dictator who exterminated blacks in the Caribbean and even used rudimentary gas chambers in the holds of ships. </p>
<p>&ldquo;All the facts contained [in the book] are known to historians but are wilfully overlooked,&rdquo; writes Ribbe, a black academic who sits on a government panel on human rights. </p>
<p>According to black pressure group the Collective of Overseas French, Napoleon was also guilty of laws banning blacks from mainland France and inter-racial marriages. And by his 1802 order re-authorising the &ldquo;triangular&rdquo; trade in slaves after it was outlawed in the revolution, he consigned &ldquo;200,000 Africans to slavery and more than a million to death&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Angry at what it says is official complaisance in the myth of Napoleonic glory, the collective staged a protest demonstration in Paris yesterday &mdash; even as thousands of enthusiasts were re-enacting Austerlitz at the battlefield hundreds of miles to the east. </p>
<p>But many historians are concerned that obsessions of the moment are obscuring the task of objective analysis, and accuse the government of weakly bending to the political wind. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Two and a half centuries of French history have just been consigned to the rubbish-bin,&rdquo; wrote the internationally-renowned academic Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie.</p>
