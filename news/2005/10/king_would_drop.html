<h1><a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05272/579728.stm">King Would Drop Suit For No-Show School Job</a></h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy McConnell Schaarsmith, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Sept. 29</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Andrew King, former interim superintendent of the Pittsburgh Public Schools, has promised to drop his threatened lawsuit against the district in exchange for being given what amounts to a no-show job for at least three years. </p>
<p>King would waive all legal claims against the district and leave his current post as chief academic officer &mdash; the district&rsquo;s No. 2 position &mdash; in exchange for appointment as special assistant to the superintendent in charge of complying with federal No Child Left Behind Act, according to an e-mail message his lawyer sent the district yesterday. </p>
<p>Unless informed otherwise, King&rsquo;s only duty would be to receive reports from current employees on whether the district is obeying the law, the message stated. He would be paid a starting salary of $150,000 a year, an increase from the $125,000 a year he currently receives. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The proposal, which some board members said created hot debate, was rejected behind closed doors before last night&rsquo;s legislative meeting. Instead, board members approved moving King into a new position, &ldquo;special assistant to the superintendent on special assignment,&rdquo; for which he will continue to be paid his current salary of $125,000 a year. The vote was 6-0, with Mark Brentley, Randall Taylor and Floyd McCrea abstaining. </p>
<p>But the duties for that position haven&rsquo;t been decided, according to schools Superintendent Mark Roosevelt, who proposed the transfer that was approved. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><img src="/news/2005/10/king.jpg" alt="" class="left" style="float:left;padding-right:1em" /> King, a 53-year-old grandfather of six, was arrested in 1999 for having sex with a homeless woman in the back of a parked truck behind Robert L. Vann Elementary School in the Hill District. He was charged with open lewdness but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of disorderly conduct. </p>
<p>King was demoted, but worked his way back up the district&rsquo;s administrative ladder and became interim superintendent after former superintendent John W. Thompson was ousted in January. </p>
<p>King applied for the position of permanent superintendent, but was not among the 10 semifinalists picked by search committee members. </p>
<p>As a result, King threatened the board on Sept. 1 with a lawsuit, claiming that racial discrimination had played a part in his rejection.</p>
