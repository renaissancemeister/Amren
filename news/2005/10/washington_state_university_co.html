<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>PULLMAN, Wash.&mdash;In recent months, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) has intervened twice at Washington State University to protect students&rsquo; freedom of expression. After publicly proclaiming respect for their students&rsquo; rights, Washington State administrators have now made clear that, between their grading students on their politics and their paying for hecklers to disrupt student plays, liberty is still in dire straits in Pullman. </p>
<p>&#147;The latest developments at Washington State are quite revealing,&#148; remarked FIRE President David French. &#147;After the administration twice </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6332.html"><b><font size="3">refused to apologize</b></font></a><font size="3"> for subsidizing disruptive hecklers and refused to guarantee that it wouldn&rsquo;t do so again, the dean of education suggested that </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6309.html"><b><font size="3">Justice Antonin Scalia&rsquo;s beliefs might disqualify him from earning a teaching degree</b></font></a><font size="3"> from Washington State.&#148; </p>
<p>This fall FIRE defended the rights of 42-year-old education student Ed Swan, a self-described conservative Christian. Swan was </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6280.html"><b><font size="3">given poor marks on &#147;dispositions&#148; criteria</b></font></a><font size="3"> used by Washington State&rsquo;s College of Education for expressing beliefs such as the idea that white privilege and male privilege do not exist. &#147;Dispositions&#148; criteria, used to evaluate students&rsquo; commitment to ideological concepts such as &#147;social justice,&#148; sensitivity to &#147;community and cultural norms,&#148; and &#147;others&rsquo; varied talents and perspectives,&#148; are used nationwide in education programs and can often jeopardize students&rsquo; First Amendment rights. </p>
<p>Before </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6274.html"><b><font size="3">FIRE intervened</b></font></a><b><font size="3"> </b>in this case, Washington State threatened Swan with dismissal if he did not sign an </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6279.html"><b><font size="3">unconstitutional contract</b></font></a><font size="3"> obliging him to submit to even more ideological litmus tests. Upon receiving FIRE&rsquo;s letter, the university dropped the contract and </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6276.html"><b><font size="3">pledged to FIRE</b></font></a><font size="3"> that it would no longer use its &#147;dispositions&#148; criteria in an unconstitutional manner. </p>
<p>Yet in </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6309.html"><b><font size="3">comments to E. Kirsten Peters, a reporter from the <i>Moscow-Pullman Daily News</b></i></font></a><font size="3">, Washington State Dean of Education Judy Mitchell revealed the College of Education&rsquo;s chilling disregard for the First Amendment. When Peters asked Mitchell if conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia could pass the &#147;dispositions&#148; criteria, Mitchell replied, &#147;I don&rsquo;t know how to answer that.&#148; She continued, &#147;I haven&rsquo;t been in on faculty discussions of how the faculty apply the language to individual students.&#148; </p>
<p>&#147;Dean Mitchell&rsquo;s unguarded comments prove that Washington State has not learned its lesson,&#148; declared FIRE&rsquo;s French. &#147;After swearing that the College of Education would not use political beliefs as a litmus test for future teachers, she admitted that she had done nothing to make sure that her students would not face these arbitrary and unconstitutional ideological tests.&#148; </p>
<b><p>The Passion of Mob Censorship</b> </p>
<p>Washington State&rsquo;s actions against Ed Swan follow its attack on the rights of </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6106.html"><b><font size="3">student playwright Chris Lee</b></font></a><font size="3">, who produced a controversial play entitled <i>Passion of the Musical</i>. Lee&rsquo;s intentionally offensive play was meant to, in his words, &#147;</font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6148.html"><b><font size="3">show people we&rsquo;re not that different, we all have issues that can be made fun of</b></font></a><font size="3">.&#148; Although he is African American himself and the play poked fun at virtually every imaginable group, Lee was accused of racism, and his play was disrupted several times by hecklers, some of whom violently threatened the actors. </p>
<p>FIRE soon discovered that Washington State administrators had </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6104.html"><b><font size="3">bought tickets for hecklers</b></font></a><font size="3"> to attend his play, and later uncovered the fact that administrators had furthermore </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6240.html"><b><font size="3">organized the protest</b></font></a><font size="3">, encouraging students to stand up and say &#147;I&rsquo;m offended&#148; every time Lee&rsquo;s play rankled them. The students did that and much more, severely disrupting Lee&rsquo;s play and trampling his First Amendment rights. After Washington State President V. Lane Rawlins </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6100.html"><b><font size="3">repeatedly</b></font></a><font size="3"> </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6190.html"><b><font size="3">refused</b></font></a><font size="3"> to admit any wrongdoing, Vice President Michael Tate asked Lee to write a letter indicating what he hoped the university would do. </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6333.html"><b><font size="3">Lee did so</b></font></a><font size="3">, emphasizing that he intends to produce other plays and is afraid his rights will not be protected. However, </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6332.html"><b><font size="3">Tate&rsquo;s response</b></font></a><font size="3"> repeated the university&rsquo;s incorrect claim that heckling is free speech, too. </p>
<p>&#147;It is ridiculous to assert that shouting down a play enjoys the same level of constitutional protection as the play itself,&#148; noted FIRE Director of Legal and Public Advocacy Greg Lukianoff. &#147;Universities have a responsibility to stop disruptive hecklers, not aid and abet them. Washington State&rsquo;s utter disregard for Chris Lee&rsquo;s rights is indefensible.&#148; </p>
<p>&#147;Chris Lee plans to put on more plays this fall,&#148; FIRE&rsquo;s French concluded. &#147;FIRE will continue to fight these abuses until Washington State acknowledges its obligation to make sure Chris Lee&rsquo;s plays are not disrupted again, and until its College of Education actually dismantles its edifice of ideological discrimination.&#148; </p>
<p>FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders, scholars, journalists, and public intellectuals from across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights, due process, freedom of expression, academic freedom, and rights of conscience at our nation&rsquo;s colleges and universities.

											<p>
							<i>John Leo, Townhall.com, Oct. 18</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>The cultural Left has a new tool for enforcing political conformity in schools of education. It is called dispositions theory, and it was set forth five years ago by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education: Future teachers should be judged by their &#147;knowledge, skills, and dispositions.&#148; What are &#147;dispositions&#148;? NCATE&rsquo;s prose made clear that they are the beliefs and attitudes that guide a teacher toward a moral stance. That sounds harmless enough, but it opened a door to reject teaching candidates on the basis of thoughts and beliefs. In 2002, NCATE said that an education school may require a commitment to social justice. William Damon, a professor of education at Stanford, wrote last month that education schools &#147;have been given unbounded power over what candidates may think and do, what they may believe and value.&#148;</p>
<p>NCATE vehemently denies that it is imposing groupthink, but the ed schools, essentially a leftist monoculture, use dispositions theory to require support for diversity and a culturally left-wing agenda, including opposition to what the schools sometimes call &#147;institutional racism, classism, and heterosexism.&#148; Predictably, some students concluded that thought control would make classroom dissent dangerous. A few students rebelled when a teacher at Brooklyn College School of Education showed Michael Moore&rsquo;s movie </font><font size="3" color="#0000ff"><em>Fahrenheit 9/11</font></em><font size="3"> in class and dismissed &#147;white English&#148; as &#147;the language of oppressors.&#148; Five students filed written complaints and received no formal reply from the college. One was told to leave the school and take an equivalent course at a community college. Two of the complaining students were then accused of plagiarism and marked down one letter grade. The two were refused permission to bring a witness, a tape recorder, or a lawyer to meet with a dean to discuss the matter. </p>
<p></font><font size="3">Robert Davd &#147;K. C.&#148; Johnson</font><font size="3">, a history professor at the school who defended the dissenting students, </font><font size="3">became a target himself</font><font size="3">. After writing an article in <em>Inside Higher Ed</em> attacking dispositions theory as a form of mind control, Johnson faced a possible investigation by a faculty Integrity Committee. The Philadelphia-based </font><a href="http://www.thefire.org/"><font size="3">Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</font></a><font size="3"> entered the case on Johnson&rsquo;s behalf, accusing the college of viewpoint discrimination and a violation of academic freedom. FIRE is a national civil liberties group that does what the </font><a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6145"><font size="3">American Civil Liberties Union</font></a><font size="3"> should be doing but usually won&rsquo;t. FIRE said: &#147;Brooklyn College must confirm that it tolerates dissent, that it is not conducting another secret investigation of one of its own professors.&#148; FIRE says the college has &#147;disavowed any secret investigation.&#148; </p>
