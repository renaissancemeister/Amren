<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>It is not so hard and can be a pleasure to tell people what you see. It&rsquo;s harder to speak of what you think you see, what you think is going on and can&rsquo;t prove or defend with data or numbers. That can get tricky. It involves hunches. But here goes. </p>
<p>I think there is an unspoken subtext in our national political culture right now. In fact I think it&rsquo;s a subtext to our society. I think that a lot of people are carrying around in their heads, unarticulated and even in some cases unnoticed, a sense that the wheels are coming off the trolley and the trolley off the tracks. That in some deep and fundamental way things have broken down and can&rsquo;t be fixed, or won&rsquo;t be fixed any time soon. That our pollsters are preoccupied with &ldquo;right track&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrong track&rdquo; but missing the number of people who think the answer to &ldquo;How are things going in America?&rdquo; is &ldquo;Off the tracks and hurtling forward, toward an unknown destination.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about &ldquo;Plamegate.&rdquo; As I write no indictments have come up. I&rsquo;m not talking about &ldquo;Miers.&rdquo; I mean &hellip; the whole ball of wax. Everything. Cloning, nuts with nukes, epidemics; the growing knowledge that there&rsquo;s no such thing as homeland security; the fact that we&rsquo;re leaving our kids with a bill no one can pay. A sense of unreality in our courts so deep that they think they can seize grandma&rsquo;s house to build a strip mall; our media institutions imploding &mdash; the spectacle of a great American newspaper, the New York Times, hurtling off its own tracks, as did CBS. The fear of parents that their children will wind up disturbed, and their souls actually imperiled, by the popular culture in which we are raising them. Senators who seem owned by someone, actually owned, by an interest group or a financial entity. Great churches that have lost all sense of mission, and all authority. Do you have confidence in the CIA? The FBI? I didn&rsquo;t think so. </p>
<p>But this recounting doesn&rsquo;t quite get me to what I mean. I mean I believe there&rsquo;s a general and amorphous sense that things are broken and tough history is coming. </p>
<p>Let me focus for a minute on the presidency, another institution in trouble. In the past I have been impatient with the idea that it&rsquo;s impossible now to be president, that it is impossible to run the government of the United States successfully or even competently. I always thought that was an excuse of losers. I&rsquo;d seen a successful presidency up close. It can be done. </p>
<p>But since 9/11, in the four years after that catastrophe, I have wondered if it hasn&rsquo;t all gotten too big, too complicated, too crucial, too many-fronted, too &hellip; impossible. </p>
<p>I refer to the sheer scope, speed and urgency of the issues that go to a president&rsquo;s desk, to the impossibility of bureaucracy, to the array of impeding and antagonistic forces (the 50-50 nation, the mass media, the senators owned by the groups), to the need to have a fully informed understanding of and stand on the most exotic issues, from Avian flu to the domestic realities of Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>The special prosecutors, the scandals, the spin for the scandals, nuclear proliferation, wars and natural disasters, Iraq, stem cells, earthquakes, the background of the Supreme Court backup pick, how best to handle the security problems at the port of Newark, how to increase production of vaccines, tort reform, did Justice bungle the anthrax case, how is Cipro production going, did you see this morning&rsquo;s Raw Threat File? Our public schools don&rsquo;t work, and there&rsquo;s little refuge to be had in private schools, however pricey, in part because teachers there are embarrassed not to be working in the slums and make up for it by putting pictures of Frida Kalho where Abe Lincoln used to be. Where is Osama? What&rsquo;s up with trademark infringement and intellectual capital? We need an answer on an amendment on homosexual marriage! We face a revolt on immigration. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I was chatting with friends about the sheer number of things parents now buy for teenage girls &mdash; bags and earrings and shoes. When I was young we didn&rsquo;t wear earrings, but if we had, everyone would have had a pair or two. I know a 12-year-old with dozens of pairs. They&rsquo;re thrown all over her desk and bureau. She&rsquo;s not rich, and they&rsquo;re inexpensive, but her parents buy her more when she wants them. Someone said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s affluence,&rdquo; and someone else nodded, but I said, &ldquo;Yeah, but it&rsquo;s also the fear parents have that we&rsquo;re at the end of something, and they want their kids to have good memories. They&rsquo;re buying them good memories, in this case the joy a kid feels right down to her stomach when the earrings are taken out of the case.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Do people fear the wheels are coming off the trolley? Is this fear widespread? A few weeks ago I was reading Christopher Lawford&rsquo;s lovely, candid and affectionate remembrance of growing up in a particular time and place with a particular family, the Kennedys, circa roughly 1950-2000. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Symptoms of Withdrawal.&rdquo; At the end he quotes his Uncle Teddy. Christopher, Ted Kennedy and a few family members had gathered one night and were having a drink in Mr. Lawford&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s apartment in Manhattan. Teddy was expansive. If he hadn&rsquo;t gone into politics he would have been an opera singer, he told them, and visited small Italian villages and had pasta every day for lunch. &ldquo;Singing at la Scala in front of three thousand people throwing flowers at you. Then going out for dinner and having more pasta.&rdquo; Everyone was laughing. Then, writes Mr. Lawford, Teddy &ldquo;took a long, slow gulp of his vodka and tonic, thought for a moment, and changed tack. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not going to be around when you guys are my age.&rsquo; I asked him why, and he said, &lsquo;Because when you guys are my age, the whole thing is going to fall apart.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
