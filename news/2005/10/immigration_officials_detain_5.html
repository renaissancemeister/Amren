	<p>NEW YORK &mdash; Immigration agents Wednesday rounded up 50 foreign-born New Yorkers who had been convicted of sex offenses, including child molestation and rape, but remained free after receiving relatively light punishments. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The arrests came after the city&rsquo;s Department of Probation shared information about convicts under its supervision with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The offenders were arrested as they showed up for scheduled visits with their probation officers. </p>
<p>Fourteen of the people arrested were legal permanent residents of the U.S., but may be deported under a law allowing the removal of anyone convicted of a crime of &ldquo;moral turpitude.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Most of the remaining sex offenders were in the country illegally, officials said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among those arrested was a 36-year-old man from Honduras who was sentenced to 10 years of probation for raping a 14-year-old, a 37-year-old woman from the Dominican Republic who received a sentence of probation for sexually abusing a five-year-old and a man from Mexico convicted of raping his 13-year-old daughter. </p>

						<p>EAST HARTFORD, Conn. &mdash; Six people were stabbed early Sunday during a melee at a 1-year-old&rsquo;s birthday party, police said. </p>
<p>It apparently started when a downstairs neighbor went upstairs to complain about the noise. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said they received several 911 calls around 12:45 a.m. They arrived at a two-family home on Crosby Street to find dozens of people running around in a thunderstorm. Some were screaming and bleeding. </p>
<p>Most spoke only Spanish, adding to the chaos. A Spanish-speaking officer from Manchester was eventually brought into translate. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said those arrested were Wilfredo Morales, Ricardo Rodriguez, Jose Hernandez, Juan Zelaya, Marlon Herrera, Nelson Romero, Eric Romero and Rene Rodriquez.</p>
