					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AAP, Oct. 17</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Winston Peters has been appointed New Zealand&rsquo;s minister for foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Helen Clark has retained power in New Zealand with a deal clinched by making outspoken, anti-migrant populist Winston Peters her new Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Ms Clark on Monday announced the formation of a new centrist government, one month after voters gave her Labour Party the most seats in Parliament, but 11 short of a majority.</p>
<p>She will serve a record third term thanks to deals including giving the nationalist Mr Peters the foreign affairs portfolio outside cabinet, in exchange for his NZ First party supporting a minority Labour government in Parliament.</p>
<p>Ms Clark wrapped up deals with four minor parties in all to continue her hold on power, first won in 1999.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have every confidence that these arrangements, which we have been working on slowly and carefully for a month now, are durable and will enable us to offer a strong and stable and progressive government for the parliamentary term ahead,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Mr Peters, a Maori, is a 27-year veteran of politics and former deputy prime minister, known for his anti-immigration views and protectionist policies.</p>
<p>His elevation comes even though he was voted out by his electorate in last month&rsquo;s election, although he retained a seat in Parliament under the country&rsquo;s mixed-member proportional (MMP) system.</p>
<p>Last year he warned of an immigrant invasion that would turn New Zealand into an &ldquo;Asian colony&rdquo; and this year he complained Muslim extremists were being allowed in the country.</p>
<p>Opposition National Party leader, Don Brash, said Mr Peters was a poor choice for the job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s astonishing not just for the New Zealand public but the whole region distrusts Winston Peters &mdash; Australia, Asia, countries of Asia which he&rsquo;s been critical of in recent years,&rdquo; Mr Brash told reporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think putting him as minister of foreign affairs does huge damage for our international reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Clark said Mr Peters&rsquo;s views on foreign policy were &ldquo;very similar&rdquo; to those of Labour.</p>
<p>However, issues of refugees and foreign trade would not be part of Mr Peters&rsquo;s responsibility, she said.</p>
<p>Mr Peters has supported the Government&rsquo;s policy on retaining an anti-nuclear policy, and opposing New Zealand troop involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Australian Government said it would work with whomever was New Zealand&rsquo;s foreign affairs minister.</p>
<p>But international relations expert Terence O&rsquo;Brien said Mr Peters&rsquo;s views on immigration would create a negative impression among Asian neighbours, while excluding the Foreign Minister from cabinet would have a disastrous effect on the country&rsquo;s international relations.</p>
<p>Also outside cabinet will be the Minister of Revenue, a post occupied by Peter Dunne of minority party United Future.</p>
<p>The biggest loser from the deal-making was the left-wing Green Party, which campaigned to be part of a coalition with Labour but stays out in protest at Ms Clark&rsquo;s alliance with NZ First and the centrist United Future.</p>
<p>The Greens instead signed a co-operation agreement with Labour to abstain on votes that could bring down the Government in exchange for some policy concessions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the policy and budgetary demands that Labour has accepted from NZ First and United Future are socially, economically or environmentally destructive,&rdquo; co-leader Rod Donald said.</p>
<p>Ms Clark&rsquo;s arrangements give her at least 61 votes in the 121-seat Parliament on confidence and money supply votes.</p>
<p>Mr Brash said the onus was on Ms Clark to hold the coalition together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be leading a vigorous opposition committed to promoting policies which are of benefit to all New Zealanders, and opposing policies which cater to narrow sectional interests,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Labour won 50 seats to National&rsquo;s 48 in the September 17 election.</p>
<p>The Maori Party and the right-wing ACT party were also excluded from the support arrangements.</p>
<p>In addition to foreign affairs, Mr Peters was given the racing portfolio and is Associate Minister for Senior Citizens.</p>
<p>Mr Dunne, also named Associate Minister for Health, said he would endeavour to get a more attractive business tax system than Australia&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The Progressive Party&rsquo;s one MP, Jim Anderton, remains as a cabinet minister in coalition with Labour.</p>
