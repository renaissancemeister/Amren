<p><font size="3"><p>The city of Bellingham and the state&rsquo;s Democratic Party have denounced as racist and divisive the presence of civilian patrols at the U.S.-Canada border and want Gov. Christine Gregoire to tell them they&rsquo;re not needed.</p>
<p>Referring to the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps as &ldquo;self-appointed militia and vigilantes with limited training,&rdquo; Bellingham&rsquo;s City Council this week passed a resolution condemning the volunteer guards, who stationed themselves Oct. 1 at eight posts between Blaine and Sumas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping that Gov. Gregoire takes a serious look at this and make it clear that militia and the Minutemen with their violence and racism are not welcomed here,&rdquo; said Bellingham Councilwoman Barbara Ryan, who sponsored the measure. She said the city has sent the resolution to Gregoire&rsquo;s office urging her to adopt a similar position for the state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The presence of these folks is disturbing because we have a long history of militia activity that has targeted people of color,&rdquo; said Ryan. &ldquo;This is not the image we need here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Washington State Democratic Party passed a similar resolution last month in anticipation of the Minutemen&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>There are about 17 Minutemen stationed at the eight posts, far from the 50 or so organizers originally anticipated. Nearly two weeks after they began their border watch, the patrols are mostly cold, wet and bored.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While some property owners have put up signs asking the patrols not to trespass on their property, others have welcomed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sense a major groundswell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think most people would rather they didn&rsquo;t show up but are willing to ride out the month.&rdquo;</p>

Washington is one of the most liberal states in the union, and Bellingham is a very liberal city for its size (mostly due to Western Washington University).  My guess is that they will recieve a warmer reception in the eastern half of the state, which is more conservative.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Seems more and more state and local officials holler &#8220;racism&#8221; at those in their communities who kinda like things the way they are, and are so unelightened they somehow don&rsquo;t see diversity and multiculturism as good things just because lots of others, like Hollywood actors, for example, say they are. Well, in this poster&rsquo;s humble opinion, let&rsquo;s see if these policy makers at various levels really understand what &#8220;racism&#8221; is. Let&rsquo;s say the changes they advocate come to pass. It&rsquo;s not too much of a stretch to say, say Bellingham, Wa. becomes primarily hispanic. Entirely possible, I think most would agree because of horrendous immigration rates. birth rates of the browns, etc. Now, when the community is mostly hispanic do you think the hispanics would want to be represented by &#8220;anglos?&#8221; Uh..don&rsquo;t think so. The hispanics would, I think it is reasonable to assume, would want to be reprsented by other hispanics. They would not want to be reprsented by whites. You with me? And that turn of events could only be called what, boys and girls and ships at seas. Go to the head of the class because you guessed it. The obvious answer: <span class="caps">RACISM</span>! When that happens, and it&rsquo;s not all that unlikely, these cretin policy makers will really know what racism is all about, and they will have it shoved up their municipal and state rears, and many, many, including of course me will simply love it.

  <font size="3"><p>Council member Ryan was born in Tacoma, Washington and grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. She moved to the East Coast where she studied and worked for several years. She graduated with a degree in Public Communication from Boston University and worked as Communication Director for Boston University&rsquo;s Institute for Responsive Education, the Lake Washington School District, and later Planned Parenthood of Delaware. Council member Ryan has always had a commitment to keeping the public informed, which has been instrumental in her success here in Bellingham. After receiving her Masters in Administration Council member Ryan decided to come back to the West Coast. She searched for an area with similar cultural opportunities as San Francisco without the excessive population. Moving to Bellingham was a very easy decision to make.</p>
<p>Council member Ryan became concerned with the direction the city was moving several years ago. She felt that the city needed to more effectively manage growth to protect the communities&rsquo; neighborhoods and environment. This concern motivated Council member Ryan to pursue a position on the council. </p>
<p>Her Priorities as a Council member Include:</p>
<p>Ensuring a long-term supply of high quality drinking water <br>
Improving transportation options <br><br>
Improving the safety of city streets and neighborhoods <br><br>
Re-developing downtown <br><br>
Connecting downtown to the waterfront <br><br>
Economic development to bring higher wage jobs to Bellingham <br><br>
Some of the projects that Council member Ryan is most proud of include chairing the Task Force on Communication in 1990 and co-chairing the Northsound the Connecting Communities Project. The former looked at ways that or city could improve communication with citizens and local organizations. It worked on the premise that in order for citizens and organizations to effectively get involved they must understand how their government operates. Many of the recommendations of the Task Force have become integrated into the way our city communicates. The latter is a composite of elected officials and planners from various Northwest Washington counties. It is interested in promoting more transportation choices such as rail, transit, and ferry to connect our region together.</p>
<p>Bellingham has been a perfect place for Council member Ryan. She loves art, music, hiking, the use of off-leash dog parks, and music. The Bellingham Festival of Music is one of her favorite events every year. For several years she has sung with the Festival Chorus. Council member Ryan&rsquo;s current term ends in 2005.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Lee Malvo<br>
Smuggled Into This Country, A Transient Life in Shelters</p>
<p>By Mary Pat Flaherty and Scott Higham<br>
Washington Post Staff Writers<br><br>
Friday, October 25, 2002; <span class="caps">A01</span></p>
<p>From the moment the young man who called himself John Lee Malvo showed up at Bellingham High School in Washington more than a month into the school year in 2001, school officials had questions about him.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have transcripts.</p>
<p>He said he lived in a homeless shelter.</p>
<p>Two months passed, and the promised paperwork never arrived. So officials notified local police.</p>
<p>Malvo didn&rsquo;t exist on paper in his new American home. He and his mother had been smuggled from St. Elizabeth, Jamaica, to Haiti and then onto a tugboat into Miami, where they illegally entered the United States, according to accounts they gave to immigration officials.</p>
<p>Malvo, who is being held as a material witness in the sniper attacks that terrorized the Washington area for more than three weeks, made his way across the country with his mother, Una James, to Bellingham, Wash., where they lived in homeless shelters but began to take on some trappings of a routine life. Malvo entered high school and joined the local <span class="caps">YMCA </span>under a family plan, interviews show.</p>
<p>It was also in Bellingham, a college town in the northwest corner of the state, that Malvo and his mother spent time with John Allen Muhammad, the 41-year-old Persian Gulf War veteran now being held on a federal firearms violation and being questioned about the Washington area killings. After launching a nationwide manhunt, law enforcement officers arrested Malvo and Muhammad early yesterday as they slept in a car at a rest stop near Frederick.<br>
&hellip;<br><br>
But it is clear that the lives of Malvo and Muhammad entwined long before officers surrounded their vehicle at the rest stop.</p>
<p>On Dec. 19, 2001, Bellingham police summoned immigration officials after police were called to a domestic disturbance between James and Muhammad, a <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Border Patrol report shows.</p>
<p>According to the report, an agent and a Bellingham officer following up on the domestic dispute tracked James to the Agape Women&rsquo;s Shelter. A local police officer said Malvo frequented the library and <span class="caps">YMCA.</span> An immigration officer found Malvo with Muhammad at the Y, where they had been playing basketball, according to interviews.</p>
<p>Malvo, who said he was 16 at the time, and James, then 37, were arrested on immigration charges by a Border Patrol agent and handed off to <span class="caps">INS </span>officials in Seattle. They were eventually released pending deportation hearings Nov. 20, nearly a year later.</p>
<p>Fingerprints that the <span class="caps">INS </span>took from Malvo ultimately helped the sniper task force identify him as someone they wanted to question, law enforcement sources said.</p>
<p>At the time of their <span class="caps">INS </span>arrest, Malvo and James were living in separate homeless shelters in Bellingham, they told the Border Patrol.</p>
<p>Muhammad, a <span class="caps">U.S. </span>citizen, was living at the same Bellingham shelter   &mdash;   the Lighthouse Mission   &mdash;   as Malvo at the time of the <span class="caps">INS </span>arrest, federal law enforcement sources said. When officers asked Malvo if heknew Muhammad, Malvo said yes, but Muhammad denied knowing the boy, law enforcement officials said.</p>
<p>Malvo and James were detained for about a month by the <span class="caps">INS,</span> James in Seattle and Malvo at a juvenile center in Spokane, law enforcement agents said.</p>
<p>James was later released on $1,500 bond, and Malvo was released on his own recognizance.&#8221;</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Canada is an open sieve for <span class="caps">ANY </span>&#8216;refugee&rsquo; (restricted to 3rd world countries, of course) whose only requirement is to utter the magic password to gain entry. Then from this side of the border, thousands of phoney refugees will attempt to cross over into the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>to fulfill their monetary obligations to their &#8216;snakeheads&rsquo; (people smugglers). They&rsquo;re en route to major <span class="caps">U.S. </span>cities to work as endentured servants in various employment capacities under the tuteledge of their criminal benefactors. People-smuggling syndicates operate in countries such as Iran, India, China, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Nigeria and Brazil. Canada is a favourite destination because we have the highest acceptance rate of refugees in the world   &mdash;   up to 70 percent of those who apply, compared to 17 percent for the United States and seven percent in Germany. <br>
If we can&rsquo;t manage our borders, at the very least allow the Minutemen to protect their own borders. </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Once again the Minutemen are called racists and violent vigilantes when all they ever do is report illegal activity to the proper authorities. So I guess if I see some blacks or hispanics breaking into a neighbor&rsquo;s house and call the police that makes me a violent racist vigilante thug too! right miss clueless Barbara Ryan? It&rsquo;s odd that people who try to defend and protect this country are run into the ground and those that try to run this country into the ground ( like illegal aliens and terrorists ) are praised and defended. Really makes you wonder doesn&rsquo;t it?       </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Washington city tells the border watchers: &#8220;Violence and racism are not welcome here.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, hordes of illegal aliens that came from foreibn countries with violation of the American border and immigration laws <span class="caps">ARE </span>welcome. If this is not a hypocrisy then what is?</p>
<p>Interestingly, they charge Minutemen with targeting &#8220;the people of color&#8221;. So, according to the city authorities, as soon as a group of people of color flocks together to break the law (like Mexican mestizos that break into out country and blatantly violate all the laws that inconvenience them) they cannot be prosecuted as it would be racist doing so.</p>
<p>What a nonsense! Those who perpetuate it should be sent to a school for menatally retarded individuals for deprogramming.<br>

These guys should stop eating all that health food as it has clearly rotted their brains.

That, my friend, is Racism, not attempting to comply with federal immigration law.  If these people love the third world so very much, why don&rsquo;t they just move there and leave the rest of us alone.  They are not only racist but clearly anti-democratic.</p></font><p>Posted

As for violence, the Minutemen aren&rsquo;t violent - the opposition is!  Left-wing college students and illegal immigrants are the ones who attack the Minutemen, not the other way around.<br>

<p>People realize that Minutemen are synonymous with movements like the Ku Klux Klan, and they rightfully don&rsquo;t want that element in their town.

Posted by Tiffany Clark at 11:40 AM on October 17 </p>
<p>How dare you, huh?  Jefferson was a classical liberal, what modern day libertarians refer to as their touchstone.  Modern day liberals are Marxist socialists.  There&rsquo;s a difference.  Classical liberals held that society should operate freely without interference from government.  Government interference in the lives of the governed is the stock-in-trade of modern liberalism.</p>
<p>As with certain Bible readers, you seem to pick and choose your scripture, and still get it wrong.  Jefferson and the rest of the Founders were more concerned with individual liberty, property rights, and tyranny by the State.  And strictly speaking, it was a state mandated religion, the Church of England being the example, not organized religion, that they were against.</p>
<p>I wonder how open-minded Jefferson would be if he were alive today and could have some present-day characteristics of America described to him.  One could start out by describing for him the federal income tax system, including social security and its history.  Then one could relate the history of state enforced school desegregation, which was a clear usurpation of personal liberty.  Next one could describe to him (or at least try) the intellectual fad of multiculturalism, which places all other cultures in the world on the same level of importance as the American culture.  Finally, one could describe how the political class and &#8220;elites&#8221; are actively trying to dissolve the nation&rsquo;s borders and even national sovereignty, that even the president crows about how the US is becoming more like Latin America, both in culture and language. </p>
<p>Then, just to gauge how truly broad-minded he really is, after describing and explaining cinema and television to him, tell him about an American company with a long standing reputation as a purveyor of wholesome family entertainment that is producing television programs for young people that encourages preteen white girls to hybridize with n-e-g-r-o-e-s.  And be sure and point out that it&rsquo;s essentially being done surreptitiously, unnoticed by parents, who might very well take rabid offense if they only knew.  Then ask, Whatdaya think of that, Tom?</p>
<p>I suspect that he&rsquo;d suggest that a revolution was in order.</p>
<p>So a group of volunteer citizens armed with binoculars and radios, who avoid direct contact with border jumpers and simply act as spotters for the ineffectual Border Patrol, are synonymous with the <span class="caps">KKK</span>?!  You <span class="caps">ARE </span>a granola bar, Ms. Clark.  Are you going to deny that the Feds are purposely not enforcing immigration laws and are failing to maintain a secure border?  If I point out that <a href="http://www.balance.org/opinion_polls.html" rel="nofollow">numerous opinion polls</a> indicate that an overwhelming majority of Americans consider illegal immigration a <a href="http://www.americanpatrol.com/05-FEATURES/050320-BUSH-CON-GAME/ConGame.html" rel="nofollow">serious problem</a>, are you going to respond that they&rsquo;re simply benighted hayseeds?  In America, government exists to serve the needs of the citizenry, not the other way around, and if government fails in its function, the responsibility falls back to the citizenry.  Somehow I think that would resonate with Jefferson.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve also got it wrong about Bush.  I&rsquo;ve noticed in comments here that detractors seem to assume that members of AmRen are dyed-in-the-wool Bush supporters.  You really should check out the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arlist/" rel="nofollow">discussion list on Yahoo</a>.  It seems that most everyone there, save for the beleaguered moderator, <span class="caps">HATES HIS GUTS</span>!  And the sentiment seems to stem mostly from the obvious (and well documented) fact that don Jorge Boosh is doing his best to replace the white population of America with mestizos, so that eventually everybody in America will look like his brother Jeb&rsquo;s family, and transform the US into a northern province of Mek-ee-co.<br>
