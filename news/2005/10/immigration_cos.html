<h1>Immigration Costs More Than Thought</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter A. Brown, Orlando Sentinel, Oct. 14</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the emotional debate over immigrants, there has always been an ambiguity about whether they are a financial burden or bonanza.</p>
<p>But now, a renowned University of Florida economist who is admittedly pro-immigration in his personal politics has found that its net financial cost to taxpayers is much larger than anyone had been able to quantify previously.</p>
<p>UF economist David Denslow found a net cost of $1,800 per year to the state per immigrant family, which will provide ammunition for the anti-immigration folks.</p>
<p>Denslow&rsquo;s academic credentials and political track record add credibility to the finding. He is a distinguished service professor, a registered Democrat who voted for President Bush in 2000 but against him in 2004, and was an adviser to Republican Gov. Bob Martinez in the 1980s.</p>
<p>He crunched the numbers and found in Florida each immigrant household costs the state roughly $1,800 on a net basis. In other words, $1,800 is the total of how much more public services immigrants consume mostly Medicaid and education and how much less in taxes they pay than does the average resident.</p>
<p>Although his research and calculations pertain only to Florida, &ldquo;We would think that would be close to the national figure&rdquo; for other states, Denslow said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But just taking the roughly 10 million illegal immigrants in the United States, and using Denslow&rsquo;s figures, that would come to a cost of about $18 billion annually, slightly more than the entire NASA budget.</p>
