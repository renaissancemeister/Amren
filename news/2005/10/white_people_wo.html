<h1>White People Won&rsquo;t Vote for Blacks, Congressman Charges</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nathan Burchfiel, CNSNews.com, Oct. 14</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus on Friday urged his Capitol Hill colleagues to extend and strengthen the Voting Rights Act in order to &ldquo;level the playing field&rdquo; because, U.S. Rep. Melvin Watt said, &ldquo;white people &hellip; will not consider voting for an African American candidate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watt, a Democrat from North Carolina, made the remarks at a Washington hearing held by the National Commission on the Voting Rights Act. The commission, a project of the Lawyers&rsquo; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, is conducting nationwide hearings to gather data on voter discrimination for a report it will issue supporting the extension of the Voting Rights Act. </p>
<p>Watt told Cybercast News Service that his views are based on a 1980s blind poll of North Carolinians, which he said revealed that 30 percent of whites would not vote for a black candidate under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Watt told the commission that if another poll were conducted today, &ldquo;there would be a substantial majority of white voters who would say that under no circumstances would they vote for an African American candidate.&rdquo; He later amended his comments, allowing that &ldquo;some of them would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The number of white Americans who would refuse to vote for a minority candidate is &ldquo;decreasing,&rdquo; Watt conceded, but he maintained that the Voting Rights Act should &ldquo;adjust districts to take [racially motivated voting] into account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Voters refusing to vote for a minority candidate &ldquo;need to be factored out of the equation,&rdquo; according to Watt, because &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no use for them in the democratic process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watt admitted that some black voters only cast ballots for black candidates, but said in those cases, the voters are exercising &ldquo;preference,&rdquo; which he said is different than &ldquo;an absolute commitment&rdquo; to cast a vote based on race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black people have not had the luxury of being able to say, &lsquo;Under no circumstances will I vote for a white candidate,&rsquo;&rdquo; Watt said.</p>
