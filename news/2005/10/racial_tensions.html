<p><font size="3"><p>Milton Academy canceled two afternoon classes and called an emergency assembly yesterday in an effort to defuse racial tensions that erupted at the prep school over comments that appeared last week on a school-sponsored website and on fliers scattered in a campus building, school officials said.</p>
<p>In the first instance, which occurred on the school&rsquo;s Young Republicans online forum, students were commenting on recent controversial remarks by conservative radio host William Bennett that suggested the crime rate would decline if black babies were aborted.</p>
<p>The school would not detail what was said on the online forum, but many students were offended by the comments, according to The Milton Paper, a student newspaper at the academy.</p>
<p>It was not clear if the comments considered offensive were made by Young Republicans members.</p>
<p>Within days, papers were found spread across a campus building floor with the words, &ldquo;[expletive] kill all whites,&rdquo; the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>School officials said yesterday that the incidents are under investigation, but students involved are not expected to face discipline.</p>

<p>THus, if you <span class="caps">DID </span>abort all blacks, you would decrease felony crimes by 50%. Bennett was correct.</p>
<p>Now, why can one not have abortions to <span class="caps">LOWER </span>crime? You can have abortions because:</p>
<p>1) You feel like it<br>
2) It will interfere with your life style<br><br>
3) You hate the father<br><br>
4) You don&rsquo;t know the father, but hate him anyway<br><br>
5) You were really drunk that night<br><br>
6) You don&rsquo;t like kids<br><br>
7) &hellip;.because&hellip;.just, because.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>It isn&rsquo;t surprising that non Whites will not be disciplined for making death threats against Whites.  Were the tables turned, a White student would be criminally and civilly punished for making death threats against a non White.  This is part of the double standard that exists in the Western world, against Whites.  It is also this double standard that encourages non Whites to commit all manner of aggressions against Whites, as they have no fear of punishment.  The double standard serves as a green light to non Whites to aggressively pursue Whites at any level - obviously even to the extent of death threats and physical violence.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Notice how LaToya gloats at the irony of a former white European nation kind enough to fight a civil war to end slavery at the cost of millions of whites, integrate all aspects of society by the 1970&rsquo;s by promoting all sorts of racial lies and now have its core culture refabricated to echo black/minority entertainment, culture and customs at it&rsquo;s own demise. She/he/it gloats as white America, the only stabilizing force on this whole rotten planet with its multiculturalism, inclusivness diversity and importation of all races, black, hispanic, asian, etc kill the one lot that basically handed over all that they built to a people that clearly will run this country into third-world status within most of our lifetimes. So La Rhonda, when the equivalent of the New Orleans disaster along with its minority mismanagement hits your ghetto what will you do, who will you blame, when this nation is 70 percent minority and you are a minority to hispanics?</p>

  <font size="3"><p>la rhonda,</p>
<p>As Mattox has already commented, if it was an all-white school, how did your mother and her black classmates come to be there? </p>
<p>Be that as it may, your posting seems intent on communicating to all how awful it was for your mother and her classmates to be treated that way. </p>
<p>I found it notable though that you made no mention then of how awful it was for the White students in this case to be treated that way so many years after the (un)Civil Rights Act of 1964 cast its glorious glow of (in)equality upon all of us.</p>
<p>Blacks often seem to be driven by a desire for dominance, whether over each other or anyone else that might suffice. The double standard that exists in America today, where &#8220;diversity&#8221; is simply a euphemistic cover phrase for &#8220;Anything Non-white,&#8221; is pure evidence of that.</p>
<p>Blacks have done nothing more than turn the tables. Plain and simple. <span class="caps">EEO,</span> Title <span class="caps">VII, </span>affirmative action&hellip;nothing but government-sponsored malarky that you people use in your efforts to &#8220;get over.&#8221; </p></font><p>Posted

<p>By now, you know they&rsquo;re all (or most of &#8216;them&rsquo;   &mdash;   split personalities, perhaps?) are functionally illiterate, innumerate, illogical, factually challenged, almost never respond to people when they point out their mistakes, ad infinitum   &mdash;   and whomever he/she/they/it is/are, he/she/they/it <acronym title="s">HATE</acronym> <span class="caps">US.</span></p>
<p>Why even bother with these people (or person)? All they want is attention and to get a rise out of any/all of us. I (just like everyone else) challenged him/her/them/it a few times a long time ago, with zero results (same as everybody else), so obviously I gave up and stopped wasting my time.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ANYBODY </span>can say <span class="caps">ANYTHING </span>on the Net and they never have to back up <span class="caps">ANY</span> OF <span class="caps">IT.</span> If you don&rsquo;t respond to he/she/them/it, then sooner or later he/she/them/it will go away (as have all the other drive-by troll posters in the past). That&rsquo;s human nature. Oh sure, they&rsquo;ll hang around for a while, but sooner or later (as all their predecessors have), they&rsquo;ll wither away and go back to their meaningless lives.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t fret   &mdash;   there will <span class="caps">ALWAYS </span>be new and improved trolls showing up. They always have and they always will. They&rsquo;re like VC   &mdash;   you grease one and ten new ones pop up.</p>

In fact, I think some of them weren&rsquo;t allowed to graduate from <span class="caps">GHS. </span></p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The whites that La Rhonda <i>says</i> her mother had to put up with, were reacting to their knowledge that if the stiuation was allowed to progress, it would turn into exactly the situation those Boston students face today. We should have listened to them.</p>
<p>Allow me to tell you about MY high school experience. My high school was 50% White, and 50% Mexican. We got along pretty well; every now and then, somebody honor would be offended to the point that we would have a fight (usually on Friday at around 11:00 am, so we could get out of school early). That all changed when Compton Unified School District (you know, the birhtplace of the Crips and Bloods) decided to ship their troublemakers over to us. That&rsquo;s when the guns started appearing on campus. Plus, the two biggest troublemakers decided to start race riots, with the Mexicans on their side. I don&rsquo;t know what was said, but the mood got really ugly between people that formerly got along pretty well. This went on for about two weeks, until the blacks beat up a Mexican kid. <span class="caps">OOPS</span>! A grave tactical error on their part. After the first riot where Losa Angeles Sheriff&rsquo;s Office deputies had to be called, and the threat of expulsion (which still meant something to them back then; look how far it&rsquo;s deteriorated), the ringleaders called a truce and remembered their manners. </p>
<p>Did we all hold hands and sing &#8220;Kumbaya?&#8221; Of course not; individuals still had their differences, but it was understood that whole gangs were not going to attack people based on skin color alone. </p></font><p>Posted

<p>&#8220;<i>&hellip;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I would like to do the same.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Anytime. Without going into (too much) detail (and to keep this very short), I&rsquo;m a (security) programmer who was H-1B&rsquo;d into oblivion (i.e. Bumf*ckistan) along with 1/2 my dep&rsquo;t a long time ago.</p>
<p>Right now, I do (roughly) what Ian does here for another conservative site. If the software is programmed correctly, you can tell Static (i.e. non-changing) IP Addresses (i.e. cable   &mdash;   unless you &#8216;reset&rsquo; it) of submitted posts. Dynamic (i.e. always-changing) IP Addresses (i.e. dial-up) are harder to tell, but you can approximate by looking at the Subnet Mask <span class="caps">IP, </span>the Default Gateway, doing a Reverse IP Trace, a Reverse <span class="caps">DNS</span> Trace, Pinging, blah, blah, blah, blah (sorry to bore you here).</p>
<p>Point being, with the proper software, you can pretty much tell if LaRhonda is Jamal is Patel is Jason is <span class="caps">UBM </span>is Uppity Black is me or you or anyone else who has a <span class="caps">PC.</span></p>
<p>Instead of wasting my time anymore (and I&rsquo;ve been doing this for years and years and years on endless boards against endless mind-droned idiots, who all spout the same speech like Stepford Wives), I don&rsquo;t bother anymore, unless it&rsquo;s to leave some wise-crack retort, which bothers he/she/them/it no end. Once in a blue moon, I&rsquo;ll respond with facts or <i>c</i>ites or <i>s</i>ites or stats or w/e, knowing I&rsquo;m talking to someone who needs (or has had) a frontal lobotomy.</p>
<p>&hellip;and now for my oft-repeated joke:</p>
<p><b>Q.</b> What is the difference between a leftist and sheetrock?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> NOTHING   &mdash;   Except for the fact that sheetrock serves an actual <span class="caps">USEFUL </span>purpose in this world&hellip;<br>

  <font size="3"><p>Interesting that a private school, which charges the parents of it&rsquo;s students hefty tuition bills, has essentially promised in advance that the students involved in these racist death threats will not face disciplinary action.  If I were one of the parents, I would immediately withdraw my children from the school, enroll them elsewhere, and send Milton Academy&rsquo;s administrators and board members each a copy of a letter explaining exactly why.  This is called &#8220;voting with your wallet&#8221; and it works.  One does not provide idiots like the twits running Milton Academy warnings.  You punish them immediately.</p>
<p>As for the quote above, &#8220;I shall, if I ever find the names and addresses of anyone involved in this website&hellip;&#8221;, I already post under my own name and I am listed in the Colorado Springs telephone directory.  I have a basement full of power tools and a drain in the floor.  Bring it.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>We all know that whites wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to advocate killing blacks.  There would be severe punishment from the school and the usual moralizing and grandstanding from the anti-white ideologues of the national media.</p>
<p>As long as blacks know there will be no consequences for this behavior towards whites expect it to continue.  Until whites collectively begin retaliating (perhaps violently) then more incidents such as this will become ever more frequent.  </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>  Why do liberal white idiots always have so much money? Our cultural elite undoubtedly paid to send sizeable numbers of blacks to this expensive prep school so blacks could leapfrog poor and middle class whites, and wealthy white children could experience the advantages of diversity, such as being terrorized by black classmates, just like poor white children in urban schools! Blacks rarely spring for private school tuition-as New Englanders are now finding out, they save their money to spend on necessities like malt liquor and lap dances at strip clubs. The almighty made a rare fool when he made white liberals!</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>This is a great example of &#8220;tolerance&#8221; when tolerance means you&rsquo;re so open-minded your brain has fallen out.  Google &#8220;Wichita Horror&#8221; and see first-hand what blacks are doing to whites, daily, and it&rsquo;s too politically incorrect for the mainstream media to pick up on. If the races had been reversed  this depraved frenzy of rape, torture and murder would have been covered by the international media.</p>
<p>93% of inter-racial crime is black on white  and hispanics are, for some reason, categorized as whites, which means the actual percentage of black on white  crime is more like 99%.<br>
40 years of quotas, affirmative action, contractual set-asides, and a <span class="caps">HUGE </span>well of white guilt and good-will has led us to this reality:Most blacks can&rsquo;t cut the mustard intellectually, ethically, morally or lawfully. Two factors: Sub-Saharan Africans -wherever they re-locate, have an IQ approximately 30 points lower than Caucasians.  <span class="caps">PATHOLOGY </span>within the black community-promiscuity, welfare-culture, blaming whites  for their children&rsquo;s misconduct, drug use, macho-gun gangstas and a &#8220;blame whitey&#8221; mentality. <br><br>
I <span class="caps">WISH </span>it weren&rsquo;t so - but whites need to arm themselves and stop putting up with the &#8220;tolerance&#8221; bull.  We are being criminally beseiged, and it&rsquo;s time to acknowledge and stop it.  </p></font><p>Posted
