<h1>Beck Responds To Letter From Mexican Consulate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Sowinski, Lima News (Oh.), Oct. 4</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>LIMA &mdash; After receiving a letter from the Mexican consulate warning him about profiling Mexicans, Sheriff Dan Beck said Monday his agency may increase enforcement against illegal immigrants. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is the type of attitude he wants, it appears he&rsquo;s trying to coerce me into doing nothing. It tells me this is a more important issue. He just raised the priority here,&rdquo; Beck said. </p>
<p>Beck was talking about a letter he received from Antonio Meza, the consul for the Mexican Consulate in Detroit. The letter was sent to Beck last month after Beck announced a plan to train his deputies on recognizing fraudulent forms of identification. </p>
<p>In the letter, Meza said he&rsquo;s been informed that Beck&rsquo;s agency is targeting Mexican nationals living and working in the area. He also said Beck&rsquo;s officers have gone as far as to ask Mexicans for their immigration papers as they wait to be picked up by their employers. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see being an immigrant and a day laborer as reasons to be profiled,&rdquo; Meza wrote. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meza&rsquo;s letter came on the heels of Beck&rsquo;s announcement to form a &ldquo;working group&rdquo; to ad-dress crime associated with illegal immigrants. Beck expressed his concerns after a triple fatal car crash July 24 involving illegal immigrants. He also was concerned after an accused child molester from Hamilton fled to Lima to avoid prosecution. </p>
<p>Meza said Beck has not responded to his letter or extended an invitation to meet, as Meza requested in the Sept. 6 letter. </p>
<p>Beck said he plans to send a letter in response but hasn&rsquo;t gotten around to it, partly because he was out of the office for nearly two weeks. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a priority on my list. He&rsquo;s not important to me. I&rsquo;m not going to jump every time someone sends a letter to my office,&rdquo; Beck said. &ldquo;He needs to understand he&rsquo;s a guest of the U.S. and he&rsquo;s not going to prejudge someone the people of this county elected.&rdquo; </p>
