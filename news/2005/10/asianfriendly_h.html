						<p>Bristol: An Asian housing association in Britain has built a block of flats especially designed not to offend Muslims &mdash; the toilets do not face Makkah [Mecca].</p>
<p>The 16 flats in the St Paul&rsquo;s area here have been built by Bristol-based Aashyana Housing Association, an Asian-led organisation. The toilets in the apartments have been built in such a way that they do not face southeast.</p>
<p>Farooq Siddique, from the Bristol Muslim Cultural Society, said he welcomed developments that took into consideration the cultural diversity of tenants.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;I think it is a good thing that the flats are designed in this way. We do live in a multi-cultural society and rather than just paying lip service to that, it is important that there are policies in place that address it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having toilets facing the right way is an issue that comes up, as Muslims do not like using them if they are facing in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the 14 tenants who have already moved in are white. The remaining two flats are currently in the process of being let.</p>
<p>Built at a cost of 1.7 million pounds, the flats have a number of design features to make them user-friendly for Asian tenants.</p>
<p>These include a designated area of worship for Sikhs; powerful extractor fans in the kitchen because Asian families prefer steam cooking which leads to condensation problems; larger kitchen cupboards because Asian families tend to use more pots.</p>
<p>Saeed Anwar, chief executive of Aashyana Housing Association formed in 1992, told the local media: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t need to consult with the Muslim community about the toilets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew this would be pleasing to them if the toilets were not facing Mecca. It didn&rsquo;t mean any extra cost to us &mdash; it was just a question of making sure they were not facing southeast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can build homes which are pleasing to all members of the community, then this is a good thing. If an English tenant moved in, they would use the cupboards or the toilets and not think about them &mdash; but it can make an extra difference to others.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Anwar said tenants for the flats were chosen according to need, not colour, creed or race.</p>
<p>Marcus Knights, Aashyana&rsquo;s development officer, who oversaw the building, said: &ldquo;The project has been an exciting one and the quality of the homes we now have to offer people in this development is exceptional.&rdquo; </p>
<p>One of the first residents to move in was Royal Mail worker Mustaf Hussain, who is sharing one of the two-bed flats with a friend.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We moved in as soon as we could. The apartment is fantastic and we were really happy to get it as we had been waiting to get a place. It is really modern and great for this area of the city where there is a lot of need for good housing.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Hussain, who was referred to the housing association from Bristol City Council&rsquo;s waiting list, had previously been homeless.</p>
<p>The flats were built to meet the demand for housing for south Asian people here and most of the cost of the scheme was met by the government-backed Housing Corporation with contributions by the city council and the association&rsquo;s parent body, the William Sutton Group.</p>
<p>Anwar said: &ldquo;We are not exclusively for Asians. Our doors are open, and we assess on a needs basis &mdash; people of all colours and creeds come to our homes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Bristol City Council spokeswoman Kate Hartas said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the council&rsquo;s perspective it is important that the city has good quality housing that meets the needs of our tenants, so we ensure that we work with a number of housing associations &mdash; including some smaller, specialist organisations &mdash; that can provide for specialist needs within a wide range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all our allocations, we apply the normal criteria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where there are two households of equal priority who qualify for an Aashyana home, we would offer to the household who would most benefit from the culturally &mdash; sensitive services that Aashyana provides.&rdquo;</p>
