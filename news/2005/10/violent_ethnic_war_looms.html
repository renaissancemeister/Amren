					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ethan Baron, The Province (Vancouver), Oct. 21</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A violent ethnic war between Filipino and Vietnamese youths in the Lower Mainland will likely escalate, Vancouver police said yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s even more alarming is that sometimes the intended victims don&rsquo;t even belong to the disputing groups, but just happen to be a member of that community,&rdquo; said police Insp. Kash Heed.</p>
<p>Investigators believe the conflict that has led to a series of bloody incidents started in July, when two Vietnamese youths were attacked, one suffering a broken arm, the other serious leg injuries.</p>
<p>In late July, a non-involved 14-year-old Asian boy was attacked by five Filipino youths because they thought he was Vietnamese, Heed said.</p>
<p>On Aug. 30, young Vietnamese were involved in a drive-by shooting.</p>
<p>On Sept. 8, a staffer at Sir Charles Tupper Secondary School in Vancouver intervened in a knife assault involving members of the two groups.</p>
<p>On Oct. 1, in the 3300-block of Vanness Avenue in Vancouver, six to seven Filipino males attacked a Vietnamese youth, puncturing his liver. About 20 minutes earlier, young Vietnamese had stabbed a Filipino youth.</p>
<p>The violence &ldquo;boiled to a crescendo&rdquo; Oct. 8 when members of both gangs went to a dance at the Polish Community Hall on Fraser Street at about 10:30 p.m., said Vancouver youth-services unit Det. Doug Spencer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all knew each of their communities were going to be there,&rdquo; Spencer said.</p>
<p>Six people were stabbed in the ensuing brawl outside the hall, two seriously. One remains in hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fortunate that no one was killed that night,&rdquo; Heed said.</p>
<p>Much of the fighting has taken place near the Joyce SkyTrain station, but other incidents have occurred around the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p>Those involved are aged between 13 and their early 20s. Many are students at Lower Mainland high schools, police said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a lot of cases the older brothers will get involved,&rdquo; Spencer said, adding that females sometimes carry weapons to the fights because male police officers are less likely to search them.</p>
<p>The fights have involved a variety of bladed weapons. The groups commonly favour machetes, swords and illegal switchblades and butterfly knives, police said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have easy access to these weapons,&rdquo; Heed said.</p>
<p>The war is fuelled by &ldquo;bravado&rdquo; and is not over drugs or turf, Heed said, adding: &ldquo;All indications are that it is going to escalate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Filipino members have been wearing red bandanas as gang &ldquo;colours,&rdquo; Spencer said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve learned this from watching videos and movies,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Vancouver police on Wednesday met with regional law-enforcement officials to implement an &ldquo;integrated approach&rdquo; to the violence.</p>
<p>Investigators expect criminal charges will be laid in connection with the attacks.</p>
<p>Police are speaking with those involved, and with ethnic community leaders and parents of assailants and victims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to tell them right up front that your son or daughter [is] doing this when they&rsquo;re outside of the home. We&rsquo;re expecting you to take some action to deal with this,&rdquo; Heed said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come back and say, &lsquo;You never told us that they were involved in this.&rsquo; You can&rsquo;t come back and say you didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
