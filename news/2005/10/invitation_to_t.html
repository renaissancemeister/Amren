	<p>THURSDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2005 12:00 NOON</p>
<p>STEPS OF SAN FRANCISCO CITY HALL, PLAZA</p>
<p>October 20th, 2005 is the 32nd Anniversary of the first murder in a series of racially motivated Zebra Killings that occurred in San Francisco during 1973/74. On that night Quita (Pirelli-Minetti) Hague was abducted along with her husband Richard, driven to an isolated railroad track area, molested and almost decapitated with a machete as she begged for her young life. Her husband miraculously survived the machete attack.</p>
<p>For 178 more days there was terror on the streets of San Francisco as a group of black men calling themselves &ldquo;Death Angels&rdquo; shot 22 men and women simply because they were &ldquo;white devils&rdquo;; 15 died. The State of California confirmed that there were 71 similar murders in the state. Some of the murderers were arrested, convicted and remain in California Prisons to this day,while others remain free on the streets of America. Some believe there were as many as 270 whites murdered: the worst racially motivated serial killings case in America. </p>
<p>The entire community of San Francisco has pretended that this tragic event never happened &mdash; that it must be deeply buried from public view along with the innocent victims, never to be mentioned again. It&rsquo;s a terrible and sad government coverup. </p>
<p>For the past eight years we have respectfully requested that important dignitaries in San Francisco attend this simple Memorial Service in memory of those innocent victims, or send a representative, and in not one case have they attended the services. </p>
<p>DIGNITARIES INVITED</p>
<p>George W. Bush, US President; US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales; San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom; All Members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors; San Francisco Police Chief; San Francisco Police Commissioners; San Francisco Archbishop; Rabbi Pierce, Synagogue; The Very Rev. Alan Jones, Grace Cathedral, ; Publishes/Editors, San Francisco Chronicle; San Francisco Examiner; SF Weekly; Bay Guardian; Local TV Stations and others. </p>
<p>WILL THEY ATTEND?</p>
