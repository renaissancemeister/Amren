<h1><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/12/AR2005111201200.html">Civil Rights Focus Shift Roils Staff At Justice</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Eggen, Washington Post, Nov. 13</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division, which has enforced the nation&rsquo;s anti-discrimination laws for nearly half a century, is in the midst of an upheaval that has driven away dozens of veteran lawyers and has damaged morale for many of those who remain, according to former and current career employees.</p>
<p>Nearly 20 percent of the division&rsquo;s lawyers left in fiscal 2005, in part because of a buyout program that some lawyers believe was aimed at pushing out those who did not share the administration&rsquo;s conservative views on civil rights laws. Longtime litigators complain that political appointees have cut them out of hiring and major policy decisions, including approvals of controversial GOP redistricting plans in Mississippi and Texas.</p>
<p>At the same time, prosecutions for the kinds of racial and gender discrimination crimes traditionally handled by the division have declined 40 percent over the past five years, according to department statistics. Dozens of lawyers find themselves handling appeals of deportation orders and other immigration matters instead of civil rights cases.</p>
<p>The division has also come under criticism from the courts and some Democrats for its decision in August to approve a Georgia program requiring voters to present government-issued identification cards at the polls. The program was halted by an appellate court panel and a district court judge, who likened it to a poll tax from the Jim Crow era.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most everyone in the Civil Rights Division realized that with the change of administration, there would be some cutting back of some cases,&rdquo; said Richard Ugelow, who left the division in 2004 and now teaches law at American University. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think people anticipated that it would go this far, that enforcement would be cut back to the point that people felt like they were spinning their wheels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Justice Department and its supporters strongly dispute the complaints. Justice spokesman Eric Holland noted that the overall attrition rate during the Bush administration, about 13 percent, is not significantly higher than the 11 percent average during the last five years under President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Holland also said that the division filed a record number of criminal prosecutions in 2004. A quarter of those cases were related tohuman-trafficking crimes, which were made easier to prosecute under legislation passed at the end of the Clinton administration and which account for a growing proportion of the division&rsquo;s caseload.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Bush administration has filed only three lawsuits &mdash; all of them this year &mdash; under the section of the Voting Rights Act that prohibits discrimination against minority voters, and none of them involves discrimination against blacks. The initial case was the Justice Department&rsquo;s first reverse-discrimination lawsuit, accusing a majority-black county in Mississippi of discriminating against white voters.</p>
<p>The change in emphasis is perhaps most stark in the division&rsquo;s appellate section, which has historically played a prominent role intervening in key discrimination cases. The section filed only three friend-of-the-court briefs last year &mdash; compared with 22 in 1999 &mdash; and now spends nearly half its time defending deportation orders rather than pursuing civil rights litigation. Last year, six of 10 briefs filed by the section were related to immigration cases.</p>
