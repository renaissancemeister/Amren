                In November, the District 
                of Columbia will elect a new mayor. Since Washington is a one-party 
                town, the winner of the general election is almost sure to be 
                the winner of the Democratic primary, Marion Barry – the man whose 
                previous tenure as mayor ended with a six-month jail sentence 
                for smoking crack cocaine. Our nation&rsquo;s capital, the city that 
                takes its name from our first President, is to be governed by 
                an ex-convict and proven incompetent. 
                <p>It is a sign of increasing frankness about race that some commentators
were willing to state the most obvious reason for Mr. Barry&rsquo;s success:
he got the anti-white vote. The fact that all the candidates in the Democratic
primary were black – as were the vast majority of voters – did not keep
race out of the campaign. Indeed, all-black elections are often about which
candidate is the most authentically black.
<p>The incumbent mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, finished a distant third. Widely
derided as ineffectual, she had recently reacted to critics by saying,
&#8220;Well, let them impeach me.&#8221; Reports of the $100,000 in city money she
spent on a fireplace for her office were still fresh when voters went to
the polls.&nbsp;
<p>Mr. Barry&rsquo;s most serious challenger, John Ray, was also at a disadvantage:
He is honest, hard-working, civic-minded, and not very colorful. What finished
him off, though, was the impossible burden of endorsements from both the
<i>Washington Post </i>and<i> Washington Times</i>, and support from the
city&rsquo;s most prominent white residents and civic groups.
<center><img src="/news/2005/11/masks.gif" height="149" width="385"></center>
As Ronald Walters, chairman of the political science department at Howard
University explained, &#8220;people voted against the white power establishment&rsquo;s
attempting to dictate their lives.&#8221; <table align="LEFT" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

Some voters were more specific. &#8220;I
voted for Barry to give the powers that be the finger, to let them know
that there is a palpable rage even among the middle class,&#8221; exulted one
37-year-old black lawyer. Even Mr. Ray&rsquo;s campaign manager conceded that
the mood among black voters was: &#8220;Ray is the establishment candidate. He
can&rsquo;t be for you when the <i>Washington Post</i> is for him.&#8221;
<p>To put the conventional wisdom in blunter terms, blacks are willing
to vote for a known loser mainly because whites cannot abide him. That
is to say, they are willing to suffer miserable city government if that
is what it takes to watch whites squirm. Is this not what it means for
voters to think that Mr. Barry&rsquo;s greatest appeal is his willingness to
&#8220;give whites the finger&#8221;?
<p>On the other hand, it may be that blacks voted for Mr. Barry because
he is the mayor they want, no matter whom the <i>Washington Post</i> endorses.
It is the job of political scientists at Howard to come up with theories
about what black voters think about the &#8220;white power establishment,&#8221; but
the truth may be simpler. At any given time, more than 40 percent of the
black men in Washington between the ages of 18 and 35 are either in prison,
on probation, on parole or waiting for trial. A criminal record makes Mr.
Barry just one of the boys. He calls his core constituency &#8220;the last, the
least and the lost.&#8221; When they can be persuaded to go to the polls – and
Mr. Barry rallied them like the Pied Piper – they may well be a voting
majority in the city.
<p>American mass democracy is a process whereby voters do not elect superior
people but people who personify their own prejudices and weaknesses. What
is true of whites is probably even truer of blacks. Marion Barry might
have won the election even if Mr. Ray had been endorsed by Louis Farrakhan
rather than by the <i>Post</i> and the <i>Times</i>.<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A Long History</font></b>
<p>Nevertheless, when it comes to sticking a finger in the eye of the white
man, Mr. Barry has a long and lurid history. As he takes office, it is
well to recall some of his antics.
<p>Mr. Barry grew up in the South and developed an early dislike for whites.
When he worked as a waiter he made a practice of spitting in the food he
served to whites, just as Jesse Jackson did. He moved to Washington, DC
in the 1960s, where he struck the then-fashionable pose of dashiki, dark
glasses, and afro-with-comb. He made something of a name for himself as
a small-time street agitator, but it was during Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s administration
that his career really began.
<p>In 1967, he somehow convinced President Johnson&rsquo;s labor secretary, Barry
Wirtz, that with enough federal money he could turn &#8220;street dudes&#8221; into
productive citizens. Thus was born Youth Pride, Inc., which, during the
first three years of its existence swallowed an astonishing $9 million
in federal grants.
<center><img src="/news/2005/11/money.gif" height="331" width="385"></center>
Some of the small businesses that began with Pride money became drug dealerships
and fencing operations, but much of the $9 million simply disappeared.
In 1969, seventeen Pride employees were indicted for embezzlement and five
were convicted. This was just the tip of the iceberg. As the black journalist
Rich Adams recalls, Youth Pride had a standard threat for any white official
who enquired about money gone AWOL:
<blockquote>&#8221; &#8216;Don&rsquo;t ask, honky motherf***er, because if you do, we&rsquo;re
going to go out on the street, and we&rsquo;re going to start a riot and say
that the white man is trying to destroy black economic progress.&rsquo; And it
scared the living s**t out of those liberals who didn&rsquo;t want any trouble.&#8221;
<p>&#8221; &hellip; . So what if Marion and [his wife] Mary Treadwell got a couple
of hundred thousand dollars? It was worth it to the federal government
not to have them stirring s**t in the community.&#8221;
<p>&#8220;Barry did it with style,&#8221; continues Mr. Adams; &#8220;It wasn&rsquo;t just rob
a 7-11. It was rob the whole goddam federal government &hellip; .&#8221;</blockquote>
<p><br>Though she was no longer his wife when she was convicted, Mary Treadwell
was eventually caught with the goods, along with four other Youth Pride
administrators. Mr. Barry operated in a steady fog of peculation, but he
was never indicted.
<p>There was worse than theft. In 1973, while he was still nominal head
of Youth Pride, four employees were shot to death in less than one month.
Three of the killers were other Pride employees.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Higher Office</font></b>
<p>During the 1970s, Mr. Barry got his start in politics. He was elected
to the DC school board in 1971, despite a complete ignorance of school
issues. He sent supporters to tape record opponents&rsquo; speeches and then
parroted their arguments word-for-word. When asked about this tactic, he
replied, &#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong with that? That&rsquo;s sophistication.&#8221;
<p>Mr. Barry was soon on the City Council and first won election as mayor
in 1978. From the start, his first concern was holding on to power. As
even a former aide confesses, &#8220;I could not separate out what he was legitimately
interested in for the public good and what he was interested in for his
political gain.&#8221;

Money was the medium in which Mr. Barry worked best. At the end of his
first year as mayor, he spent $50,000 in city money on a lavish advertising
supplement in <i>Time</i> magazine, full of photographs of himself and
praise for his administration. He put hundreds of political supporters
on the city payroll and once spent $250,000 in tax money to take 50 political
hacks on a shopping and sunbathing trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands.
<p>In Mayor Barry&rsquo;s Washington, nearly one in every five voters worked
for city government – about three times the national average. During his
12 years as mayor, he increased the number of city bureaucrats by 27 percent
while the district&rsquo;s population shrank by 30,000.
<p>Mr. Barry&rsquo;s appointees were notoriously corrupt. Two deputy mayors and
12 other top aides ended up in prison for things like extortion, fraud,
and embezzlement. The Department of Human Services, which is supposed to
improve life for the district&rsquo;s poor, was particularly uninhibited. After
one department head was caught with his hand in the till and fired, his
successor lasted only nine months before he was found to be using city
money to pay rent and buy groceries, both for himself and a group of cronies.
<p>City employees were lazy and incompetent. Although Washington had twice
as many housing bureaucrats per public-housing resident as Baltimore or
Detroit, one fifth of the public housing units were uninhabitable wrecks.
There was a seven-year wait for a city-run apartment. In the last three
years of Mr. Barry&rsquo;s tenure, judges cited the district seven times for
systematic mistreatment of people in its care: prisoners, mental patients,
housing residents.
<p>Emergency services were no better. Calls to 911 often went unanswered
and when a caller finally got through, an ambulance might not show up until
the next day. Fourteen people are said to have died, waiting for help that
never came. In 1989, about the time DC became the murder capital of the
nation and its residents were spending more money on crack cocaine than
on food and drink, <i>Washington Monthly</i> called the Barry administration
&#8220;the worst city government in America.&#8221;
<p>The mayor was unrepentant. He continued to smoke crack, make city grants
to mistresses, and accuse his critics of racism. When even the painfully
indulgent <i>Washington Post</i> began to write honestly about Mr. Barry,
he called it &#8220;a new style of lynching.&#8221; He likened himself to Gandhi and
Jesus, who were persecuted for the good they did. The more the white press
criticized him, the more blacks loved him.
<p>When, in 1990, the FBI used a former mistress as bait to trap Mr. Barry
with a crack pipe in his mouth, blacks rallied to their mayor as never
before.&nbsp;<img src="/news/2005/11/convict.gif" height="184" width="190" align="LEFT">Black
radio stations, newspapers, politicians, &#8220;civil rights&#8221; leaders, and even
preachers lined up behind the view that the arrest was a racist frame-up.
Blacks were convinced that whites had ganged up on the unoffending Mr.
Barry because he was &#8220;too smart, too strong, and too black.&#8221; Benjamin Hooks,
then head of the NAACP, called the arrest &#8220;Nazilike,&#8221; and the New York
<i>Amsterdam News</i> thundered against a government &#8220;vendetta&#8221; against
&#8220;Black public officials throughout the country who have dared to speak
out against injustice to minorities &hellip; .&#8221;
<p>After what the presiding judge, Thomas Jackson, called one of the strongest
prosecutions he had ever seen, a reluctant and mostly-black jury convicted
Mr. Barry of only one count of cocaine possession. He began serving a six-month
sentence in October, 1991. Even in the pokey, Mr. Barry could not quite
stay out of the news. In the semi-public setting of a prisoner visiting
area, a lady caller performed upon the former mayor a sex act that is still
illegal in several states.
<p>Crime and punishment did not dampen Mr. Barry&rsquo;s spirits in the slightest.
The very year he was released, he won a seat on the DC city council, representing
Washington&rsquo;s most calamitously drug- and crime-ridden ward. His September
13th victory in the Democratic mayoral primary marks what must be one of
the most remarkable political come-backs in American history.
<p>The new Mr. Barry still has the same ability to work a crowd, and he
has dressed up his act with touches of African kinte cloth on his suits,
a third wife, and a new name – Anwar Amal. He appears to have stayed away
from crack cocaine. Despite the perilous state of the city&rsquo;s finances,
he has vowed not to fire a single district employee, and has promised that
his administration will &#8220;create&#8221; housing and jobs. He has been so candid
about his Christmas-all-year-long platform that the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
calls it &#8220;loot the haves on behalf of the have-nots.&#8221;
<p>Of course, with businesses and the middle-class streaming out of a high-tax
city that does not work, it is the federal purse that must be looted. This
year, Congress is expected to stump up $668 million for the city&rsquo;s $3.4
billion budget; the city that houses America&rsquo;s largest and most recession-proof
employer cannot feed itself. The annual rites of mendicancy are not likely
to be pleasant for Mr. Barry, however. Congressmen are fuming at the prospect
of having to deal with such a notorious spendthrift.
<p>For whites in general – who had given him only a handful of votes –
Mr. Barry had a blunt message in his primary-night victory speech. &#8220;To
those white people with whatever hang-ups they have, get over it,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;I&rsquo;m the best person for Washington &hellip; .&#8221;&nbsp;
<p>The specter of malevolent whitey hung over the general election as well.
An independent city councilman, William Lightfoot, who had promised to
run against Mr. Barry explained why he was dropping out of the race: &#8220;The
white establishment wants to stop Marion Barry, and I will not be a tool
of the white establishment.&#8221; What the &#8220;white establishment&#8221; wants – a safe,
well-run city – is what blacks should want, but even Mr. Barry&rsquo;s political
opponents defer to him if they think that means they are blowing a raspberry
at the white man.<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

For years, Washington DC has been drifting out of the civilized world
towards Africa. With a population that is 70 percent black, it is only
federal money that keeps if from utter collapse. The return of Marion Barry
– complete with pseudo-African name – is just one more push in the direction
of Ouagadougou and Kinshasa.
<p>The world has grown accustomed to African kleptocrats who hector the
West for money, only to squander it while their people starve. Were the
Barry appointees, who cheerfully plundered the Department of Human Services
any different? Africa is so full of incompetence, violence, and venality
that it takes genocidal massacre or mass starvation to make the news. In
Washington, wrecked public housing, routine gang murders, and ambulances
that arrive 24 hours late are no longer news either. In choosing Marion
Barry to govern them, have the people of Washington not elected just the
sort of oaf one would expect to find in the African ruling class?
<p>The very day the <i>Washington Post</i> published its analysis of Mr.
Barry&rsquo;s primary election, it reported that so many of the city&rsquo;s public
schools had been declared fire hazards that the opening of the school year
had been delayed. Because it is the seat of government and the home of
embassies, the nation will not let Washington sink to the Nigerian depths
of Newark, Camden, or Detroit. The voters of Washington have nevertheless
chosen a man who, left to himself, would surely make it happen.</font>

  <font size="3"><p>  Marion Barry attended, and may even have graduated from Lemoyne-Owen College in Memphis, an &#8220;historically black&#8221; college. This is just one more example of why these institutions, born of segregation, are counterproductive to American society as a whole in today&rsquo;s world. These institutions, with their typically low academic standards, churn out underqualified black graduates who, once credentialed with a college degree, can demand employment in government and especially as schoolteachers in urban school districts, thereby passing on their ignorance to succeeding generations. A disproportionate number of black college graduates hail from these schools. Blacks wanted integration-now let them compete with whites, asians and others forthrightly, without having backdoor access to a college degree form institutions with significantly lower academic standards than other  institutions of higher learning. Many of these &#8220;colleges&#8221; were originally Freedman Bureau schools founded on the heels of the Civil War to teach blacks trades and occupations. Now, as Marion barry&rsquo;s career shows, they serve mainly to allow the &#8220;intellectually challenged&#8221; like Barry to obtain college diplomas, setting them loose to wreak havoc on our businesses and, more importantly, our government and schools.

  <font size="3"><p>Probably nothing describes Marion Barry any better than actual quotes he made:</p>
<p><br>
These are actual quotes taken from Mayor Marion Barry, of Washington, <span class="caps">D.C. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The contagious people of Washington have stood firm against diversity during this long period of increment weather.&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;I promise you a police car on every sidewalk.&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;If you take out the killings, Washington actually has a very very low crime rate.&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;First, it was not a strip bar, it was an erotic club. And second, what can I say? I&rsquo;m a night owl.&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;Bitch set me up.&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;I am clearly more popular than Reagan. I am in my third term. Where&rsquo;s Reagan? Gone after two! Defeated by George Bush and Michael Dukakis no less.&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;The laws in this city are clearly racist. All laws are racist. The law of gravity is racist.&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;I am making this trip to Africa because Washington is an international city, just like Tokyo, Nigeria or Israel. As mayor, I am an international symbol. Can you deny that to Africa?&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;People have criticized me because my security detail is larger than the president&rsquo;s. But you must ask yourself: are there more people who want to kill me than who want to kill the president? I can assure you there are.&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;The brave men who died in Vietnam, more than 100% of which were black, were the ultimate sacrifice.&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;I read a funny story about how the Republicans freed the slaves. The Republicans are the ones who created slavery by law in the 1600&rsquo;s. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and he was not a Republican.&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;What right does Congress have to go around making laws just because they deem it necessary?&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;People blame me because these water mains break, but I ask you, if the water mains didn&rsquo;t break, would it be my responsibility to fix them then? <span class="caps">WOULD</span> IT!?!&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>
<p>&#8220;I am a great mayor; I am an upstanding Christian man; I am an intelligent man; I am a deeply educated man; I am a humble man.&#8221;   &mdash;   M. Barry, Mayor of Washington, DC </p>

  <font size="3"><p>Ramar, that may be true, but Jared Taylor himself states in his book <span class="caps">PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS </span>that black colleges enroll only 17% of all black freshmen but produce twice that many grads, as these schools don&rsquo;t have to water down their curriculum for them. My point is that blacks do better at black colleges if Taylor is correct. That seems to be your point, too, as you say they flunk or drop out of nonblack schools at a high rate, so they &#8220;resort&#8221; to hbc&rsquo;s.

  <font size="3"><p> Cindy-My point is that it is not good for society as a whole to have black college graduates if they can&rsquo;t meet the same academic standards as white college graduates. In a truly egalitarian system, everyone should be held to the same standard. Historically black colleges, such as Fisk and Lemoyne-Owen, undermine societal standards because they are inherently inferior institutions, and their graduates don&rsquo;t meet the same academic  standards as those from even 3d tier predominantly white institutions. These graduates, once armed with diplomas, beat employers over the head with them and get jobs, predominantly in the public sector, which contributes to the decline of government services, like the legendary decline in the quality of public education and the postal service, for example. Even those blacks who do get diplomas from predominatly white colleges tend to get them in the department of Education, notoriously the refuge of the intellectually challenged student. Based on the information in Jared Taylor&rsquo;s &#8220;Paved With Good Intentions&#8221; and Murray and Herrnstein&rsquo;s &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221;, most blacks simply shouldn&rsquo;t get college degrees, because they&rsquo;re not intelligent enough, in terms of <span class="caps">IQ, </span>to deserve them. Society wouldn&rsquo;t be burdened with so many credentialled but unqualified college grads if Historically black collleges weren&rsquo;t available to give blacks  the opportunity to get a degree at lower standards-an opportunity that, for all intents and purposes, isn&rsquo;t available to whites(nor should it be). Marion Barry and Jesse Jackson are just 2 examples of blacks who didn&rsquo;t deserve a college degree, but got one(or in Barry&rsquo;s case, 2) due to the existence of historically black colleges. Think of how different their careers and our society would be if misfits like this pair hadn&rsquo;t obtained the credentials to be deemed leaders that a college diploma provides! Barry&rsquo;s success at Lemoyne-Owen and Fisk, 2 historically  black schools, and his failure to complete his studies at the University of Tennessee, a predominantly white school, just proves my point. Most blacks at predominantly white schools don&rsquo;t finish-Taylor&rsquo;s observation that <span class="caps">HBS&rsquo;</span>s account for only 17% of black college admissions, but twice that % of black college graduates, is further proof of this. <span class="caps">HBS&rsquo;</span>s are just another covert form of affirmative action for blacks that works to put whites at an unfair competitive disadvantage. The reason blacks do better at historically black schools is simple -these schools have lower academic standards! Howard is not Harvard.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Marion Barry is the only African that Bill Clinton cannot make look white. In the recent funeral service in Detroit for the dearly departed Parks icon, when Bill called himself &#8220;a nine-year old Southern White Boy, Jesse Jackson blanched. In contrast to Governor Wallace, Bill normally can outblack any Black person. But Barry is the essential Black Person and his constituents recognize that quality because they all want to be powerful, rich, crackheaded, booze-swillling, whore-mongering, anti-White, et cetera&hellip;ad nauseam.</p>
<p>Truly though, this article was the funniest I have read in a while. The quotes cited by one poster are hilarious, almost an aid to digestion. It should be entertaining to follow the mayor in his upcoming administration. Barry is a perfect example of what my late father used to call &#8220;A J-g Clown.&#8221;</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I have several comments concerning the above posts.  First, I once worked with a chemist who graduated from Fisk University. He was a nice guy and actively participated in all the diversity programs.  However, his interpretation of the natural world differed somewhat with the accepted body of knowledge.  As of yet, he remains unrecogized and unpublished in the field.  Second, antisocial behavior is slowly becoming more acceptable.  This alarms me.

<p>Not so fast. Are you aware that during Jim Crow some southern states paid other states so that blacks could receive a college education, especially southern states that did not have graduate programs in their black colleges. Ever wondered where the few black professionals who did not attend black institutions get their degrees?  Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Columbia etc. have been educating blacks for years.
