<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast &mdash; Cybercafes in the war-torn Ivory Coast are abuzz with Africans hoping to become American residents through a U.S. visa lottery that has been criticized post-September 11 as a potential loophole for terrorists. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get out of here. If I get a green card, life will change .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I will work so hard,&rdquo; said Jean-Bruce, a political science student who paid $4 to use cafe computers to register for his third visa lottery in as many years. He declined to give his family name, fearing retaliation from local authorities. </p>
<p>A few weeks ago, the U.S. State Department opened its annual &ldquo;Diversity Visa Lottery,&rdquo; &mdash; a 15-year-old program designed to broaden the pool of new immigrants entering the United States. </p>
<p>Applicants must register electronically by Dec. 5, and manager Guillaume Diagba of the Cyberbusiness Cafe reminds his patrons of the fact with a large sign reading, &ldquo;Become an American: Transform your dream into a reality.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Out of 6.3 million applicants worldwide last year, 374 Ivorians won the green-card lottery. Mr. Diagba boasts that one of the winners registered at his cafe. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lottery, established by a 1990 act of Congress, makes 50,000 green cards available every year to persons from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. </p>
<p>The winners are chosen by a computer-generated random lottery drawing but distributed among six geographic regions with preference given to the areas with the lowest annual immigration rates. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Deputy Inspector General for the State Department Ann W. Patterson has testified before Congress that despite improvements in the system &mdash; including digital fingerprinting to prevent fraud &mdash; the visa lottery remains an opportunity for criminals and terrorists to infiltrate U.S. borders. </p>
<p>And unlike temporary visas, green cards allow the holders to enter and leave the United States at will. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In a post-9/11 world, we need to know who is coming to the United States and not drawing names out of a hat,&rdquo; said John Keeley, spokesman for the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter restrictions on both legal and illegal immigration. </p>
