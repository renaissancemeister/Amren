						                  <p>(From the December 2005 issue of <i>American 
                    Renaissance</i>.)</p>
                  <p>A curious state of madness descended on the country on October 
                    24, and began to dissipate only by the first week of November. 
                    Americans lavished the praise and honor reserved only for 
                    supreme heroes on a woman whose sole achievement was to refuse 
                    to give up her seat on a bus.</font></p>
                  <div align="left"></div>
                                    <p><font size="3">From the moment Rosa Parks 
                    died at the age of 92, until she was buried nine days later, 
                    virtually every politician and organ of the media competed 
                    to see who could heap the most praise on a woman invariably 
                    referred to as a &#147;civil rights icon.&#148; She became 
                    only the 30th person&mdash;and the first woman&mdash;to lie 
                    in state in the Capitol rotunda, where President George Bush 
                    laid a wreath. Her casket was accompanied by a military honor 
                    guard for memorial services in Washington, before she was 
                    buried on November 2 in a seven-hour funeral in Detroit. The 
                    President ordered that all flags over federal buildings and 
                    bases fly at half mast. It was an astonishing tribute to a 
                    woman whose lifetime of achievement began and ended in one 
                    afternoon.</font></p>

The myth that has grown up 
                    around Rosa Parks is of an exhausted Birmingham seamstress 
                    who, in 1955, was too tired to give up her seat and move to 
                    the colored section so a white man could sit down. According 
                    to the myth, this spontaneous act sparked the Montgomery bus 
                    boycott and launched the civil rights movement. In the miles 
                    of column inches that greeted the news of her death, there 
                    were only hints of what really happened. </font></p>
                  <table width="238" align="left">
                    <tr> 
                      <td height="296"><img src="/news/2005/11/MugShotsml.jpg" width="217" height="288"></td>

                  </table>
                  <p><font size="3">In fact, Parks&rsquo;s decision 
                    to keep her seat was carefully planned by the NAACP, for which 
                    she had worked for 10 years as a secretary. Her arrest did 
                    help start the bus boycott, but she played no role in organizing 
                    it. And though the boycott has gone down in folklore as a 
                    great blow for freedom, it did not even succeed; it was a 
                    court order that integrated Birmingham&rsquo;s buses. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Several black women had already 
                    done exactly what Parks later did. They were arrested and 
                    charged with minor infractions. Parks&rsquo;s best known predecessor 
                    was Claudette Colvin, a 15-year-old high school student who 
                    refused to give up her seat on March 2, 1955. She was arrested 
                    and taken off the bus kicking and screaming. Police say she 
                    was screaming obscenities; she later claimed she was screaming 
                    that her constitutional rights were being violated. Not even 
                    Miss Colvin&rsquo;s case was the spontaneous act for which 
                    Parks is now generally remembered. The girl had been active 
                    in the NAACP Youth Council, and had even discussed strategy 
                    with Rosa Parks herself. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">The NAACP considered basing 
                    a desegregation case on the basis of Miss Colvin&rsquo;s arrest 
                    but soon decided she was not an attractive plaintiff. She 
                    was dark, and many blacks wanted a lighter-skinned spokesman. 
                    The NAACP also learned she was several months pregnant by 
                    a married man, and discovered her habit of breaking out in 
                    volleys of curses. This was not a girl conservative black 
                    church-goers would support.</font></p>

                    of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, explained years later, 
                    &#147;I had to be sure that I had somebody I could win with.&#148; 
                    Rosa Parks was far more promising: &#147;morally clean, reliable, 
                    nobody had nothing on her.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">The NAACP had been planning 
                    a bus boycott for years, and was waiting only for the right 
                    person to act as figurehead. Far from being an accidental 
                    hero, Parks was carefully groomed for her role. A white integrationist, 
                    Virginia Durr, had paid for Parks to attend civil rights strategy 
                    seminars at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee. The school, 
                    known to be rife with Communist sympathizers, was under FBI 
                    surveillance.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Moreover, Parks&rsquo;s role 
                    was strictly limited: keep her seat and hold her tongue. Others 
                    swung into action immediately to organize the boycott. The 
                    very day she was arrested&mdash;it was a Thursday&mdash;an English 
                    professor at all-black Alabama State College named Jo Ann 
                    Robinson stayed up all night mimeographing 35,000 leaflets 
                    calling for a one-day bus boycott the following Monday. On 
                    Friday, she and her students secretly leafleted elementary 
                    and high schools. As part of a coordinated effort, Montgomery&rsquo;s 
                    black preachers met and agreed to endorse the Monday boycott 
                    from their pulpits, and to hold a mass meeting Monday night 
                    at Holt Street Baptist Church to assess the results. That 
                    evening, after a surprisingly successful boycott, thousands 
                    of blacks crowded into and around the church to hear 26-year-old 
                    Martin Luther King give his first public speech. The boycott 
                    lasted for more than a year, with both the blacks and the 
                    bus company more stubborn than anyone had expected. Blacks 
                    organized carpools that even the Citizens Council had to admit 
                    operated with &#147;military precision.&#148; Parks played 
                    no role in any of this.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="3">It was not the boycott that 
                    eventually brought integration, but a court case&mdash;and 
                    one in which Rosa Parks was not even a plaintiff. In <i>Browder 
                    v. Gayle</i>&mdash;one of the four plaintiffs was foul-mouthed 
                    Claudette Colvin&mdash;a three-panel district court in Birmingham 
                    ruled on June 19, 1956 that segregated buses were as much 
                    a violation of the 14th Amendment as segregated schools. The 
                    Supreme Court upheld the decision in December. Then, and only 
                    then, did Montgomery agree to integrate its buses. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">It can be argued, therefore, 
                    that the boycott was both a failure <i>and</i> unnecessary. 
                    Rosa Parks was a catalyst in organizing what turned into an 
                    impressive demonstration of black solidarity, but virtually 
                    anyone presentable would have served equally well. Rosa Parks 
                    did not risk death. She did not face fire hoses or police 
                    dogs. She did not even face humiliation. She knew very well 
                    that if she was polite and cooperated with the police she 
                    would be treated courteously. She also knew that the NAACP 
                    and her white friends would immediately bail her out of jail.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">It is impossible, even by 
                    the most sympathetic reading, to see Rosa Parks as anything 
                    but an unimportant actor in a drama that was not even necessary. 
                    Not once, in the intervening 50 years, did she do anything 
                    of the slightest importance. Black congressman John Conyers 
                    gave her a job in his Detroit office, apparently more out 
                    of courtesy than because of her abilities. As she grew older, 
                    she mismanaged her finances, and depended on a local church 
                    to pay her rent. Eventually, her landlord simply stopped charging.

                    half hour of immobility. Surely, never in the history of the 
                    world, has so small an act won such praise. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">The last few years have been 
                    building up to the extraordinary excesses we have just witnessed. 
                    In 1996, President William Clinton presented Parks with the 
                    Presidential Medal of Freedom, and in 1999, Congress voted 
                    her its Gold Medal. These, too, are exalted honors. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Blacks are not likely to complain 
                    if whites make a demigod of an unimportant woman, but why 
                    do whites bow their heads before such transparent fraud? There 
                    is no satisfactory answer. Americans are never happier than 
                    when glorifying non-whites who have denounced the alleged 
                    sins of whites. The adulation of Rosa Parks is just another 
                    chapter in the lemming-like rush to destruction whites everywhere 
                    appear to have joined. If a still-majority-white Congress 
                    and Senate can vote by acclamation to make Rosa Parks the
