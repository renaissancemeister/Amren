<p><font size="3"><p>Winter must come awfully early to that little spit of sand called Provincetown.</p>
<p>The town isn&rsquo;t exactly Mayberry to begin with, if you know what I mean. But as the cold winds blow relentlessly down Commercial Street and the gray waves slap constantly against the shore, the isolation must lead to a total divorce from reality. Think Jack Nicholson in &ldquo;The Shining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How else to explain the bizarre behavior of a majority of the town&rsquo;s selectmen at a meeting earlier this month?</p>
<p>To wit, Selectwoman Sarah Peake spun her chair around near the end of the Nov. 14 meeting, gazed up at an oversized oil painting depicting the Pilgrims voting on the Mayflower Compact when they first landed in Provincetown, and declared that she wanted it removed.</p>
<p>Mind you, it&rsquo;s not that she didn&rsquo;t like the look or the colors or the style. It&rsquo;s not that she thought it was too big or too small for the Judge Welsh Hearing Room. It&rsquo;s not that it clashed with anything around it.</p>
<p>No, what Peake didn&rsquo;t like was that the painting didn&rsquo;t include any women. That and the fact that the painting&rsquo;s only Indian &mdash; Native American, I&rsquo;d better call him &mdash; wasn&rsquo;t holding a ballot like everyone else.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The selectmen took a vote, and three of the four supported removal of the painting. By my count, that&rsquo;s 75 percent in favor of politically correct insanity, 25 percent opposed.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Hooray for Ms Peake.  Puritanism has been bad news since its inception.  Oliver Cromwell butchered almost half of the population of Ireland during the Interregnum.  They were hideously cruel to religious dissenters in America.  They didn&rsquo;t come to America for religious freedom.  They desired a place where they could force their views on others  &mdash;  and found it.  And they had more than a little to do with the Civil War and the ensuing rape and impoverishment of the South.  Today, their ancestors are overwhelmingly liberal and anti-American.  Ted Kennedy, homosexual marriage, and the <span class="caps">ACLU </span>anyone?</p>
<p>If the descendants of the Puritans must destroy a culture, may it be theirs.</p></font><p>Posted

On another note, the coach of the East Brunswick football team came under fire because he prayed with his team before a game. He resigned his position and then rescinded his resignation. He is now suing the board of education for violating his right to pray. Nice going, coach. I hope you win a zillion bucks from those morons. Please remember to boycott those stores that refuse to mention the word   &#8220;Christmas &#8221; in their ads. This is all part of the same battle.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Having been raised on Cape Cod I can give you some collateral information here.<br/>
When the Mayflower landed in North America, it was in Provincetown. After 2 months, they set sail to the West and landed at Plymouth. Good move. <br/><br/>
I really believe that Sarah was upset and wanted the painting taken down because the Englanders had the good sense to see what a weird place P-Town was and moved on. As to the &#8220;all male&#8221; cast in the picture I don&rsquo;t see that as a problem. All women I&rsquo;ve known from P-town swing both ways.<br/><br/>
As to the absence of a ballot in the Native&rsquo;s hand - he was the Chief of the Wampanoags and had probably just called for a vote of confidence in his leadership, which he no doubt secured. So, it is not always true that a picture is worth 1000 words.<br/><br/>
Finally, when David Thoreau travelled to Cape Cod to write his book &#8220;Cape Cod&#8221; he stopped in Eastham - about 25 miles short of P-town. Now, that tells you something.<br/><br/>

What if the picture showed the Indian drunk, wearing fur and Eagle feathers (how dare they), holding a scalp and smoking pot? (okay, the left likes pot).

  <font size="3"><p>Paintings look the way they do because they reflect the politics, beliefs and social conditions of the times.<br/>
  From this painting we would have learnt that Indians didnt vote then and that perhaps White folks didnt want them to vote, we might also have learnt that women  didnt have to have much of a say in running things either. <br/><br/>
I&rsquo;m not familiar with the painting but removing it only removes evidence that people were different several hundred years ago. That doesnt empower those Indians or Pilgrim women nor does it empower todays generations  - because its been removed.<br/><br/>
 <br/><br/>
This is censorship akin to Nazis and Communists actions. </p></font><p>Posted

<p>Of <span class="caps">COURSE </span>the Indian was voting   &mdash;   he was voting on a Proposition to award himself Foxwoods Casino (see, bet ya didn&rsquo;t know they had casinos then, huh?). Of course it had to be run by the Pilgrims because the Indians didn&rsquo;t have a clue or the IQ to figure out how to run it; plus the fact that they were a little too busy &#8216;being one with nature and all&rsquo; (when they weren&rsquo;t drunk on their a**es).</p>
<p>Btw, I object strenuously to SelectMAN   &mdash;   it represents such a racist, white, patriarchal, oppressor status. I say we change it to SelectPerson or SelectThing or SelectAndrogynous or do the same as they did to the word Chairman   &mdash;   just make it &#8220;Select&#8221;.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Of course, there were no women in the painting. They did not write the Mayflower compact, and were not allowed to vote. Men wrote it.  </p>
<p>And why would the Indian not be casting a ballot? He did not regard it as his government, because it wasn&rsquo;t. The Indian had his own laws and ways. I might add that whites today are not allowed to cast a ballot on an Indian reservation.</p>
<p>The painting may be offensive to Miss Peake, but it is historically accurate, which seems to be a rarity these days.  Artwork may be the last vestige of historical accuracy we have, and it should not be sacrificed for the sake of someone&rsquo;s  feelings. </p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t she know that in the art world, anything goes? In New York, a few years ago, an African artist (I forgot his name) displayed paintings done with poop, and had pictures of the Virgin Mary with pornography next to her. (I saw his artwork in Minneapolis at the Walker Art Center). It was absolutely disgusting. How can we forget the crucifix of Christ in a jar of urine? The liberals defended these artists, because it comes under the banner of artistic freedom of expression. But find a picture of Puritans casting a ballot for the Mayflower compact, and someone gets their knickers in a twist. How ironic is this? Without the Mayflower compact, they wouldn&rsquo;t be here today railing about their right to freedom of expression. </p>
<p>If all artwork were to be judged by a politically correct standard, and removed because it might offend someone, then more than half the artwork in every major museum in the world would disappear from their collections. Museums are full of art glorifying white western culture such as: Biblical scenes, paintings of dead white men, Greek and Roman statues, Europeans with no people of color in the picture (gasp!), etc. There would be nothing left but a little pornography. So leave the artwork alone. </p>
<p>(P.S. Amren posters: If you want to see the glories of our Western culture, go to a traditional museum and you will be pleasantly surprised. I say traditional because most modern museums have &#8216;art&rsquo; work that is basically left-wing political propaganda by people with little or no talent.)</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;And Sarah Peake turns around and faces [the painting], and it&rsquo;s government. They&rsquo;re voting. She says, &#8216;I&rsquo;d like to talk about this painting. I find this painting disturbing.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s a quote. She said it&rsquo;s disturbing to her because there are no women in the painting and the only one not holding a ballot is the Native American Indian. And I thought, &#8216;Here we go.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>[The reporter] called Peake and asked her why. She sounded normal, even pleasant, and explained that her proposal was mostly born of a tremendous pride in the town&rsquo;s vast art collection, and she wanted to give other paintings the chance to hang in such a prominent spot behind the selectmen.</p>
<p>&#8221;I feel it&rsquo;s somewhat of a tempest in a teapot,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>_______________________</p>
<p>I suspect that Miss Peake is telling the truth.  She really did not care about the political correctness. What she really wanted was to get a picture of her own choosing up on the walls.  Simple as that.  She really doesn&rsquo;t want to make a big issue of it, she just wants to apply enough pressure to the men she works with that they bend to her will, and accusations of sexism and racism are the easiest and most effective female tools to use.</p>
<p>It is all about minority and female power, not justice, and not hurt feelings or being &#8220;disturbed&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Women and minorities have learned that they can call the race card or the gender card and get what they want from white men. It works, simple as that.  Your daughters are taught these manipulative techniques in high school and college, and your young men are similarly taught to give in because they are evil.</p>
<p>Your women do not respect such p-whipped men, and your men (quite understandably) don&rsquo;t want to be married to such harridans, and the white race is shrinking as a result. </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>&#8220;No, what Peake didn&rsquo;t like was that the painting didn&rsquo;t include any women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like other feminists, she bemoans the historical oppression of women, but at the same time would like to eliminate any historical <i>evidence</i> of that oppression.  Idiot.</p>
<p>&#8220;That and the fact that the painting&rsquo;s only Indian &mdash; Native American, I&rsquo;d better call him &mdash; wasn&rsquo;t holding a ballot like everyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because foreigners should have the right to vote the same as citizens.  Idiot.  What on earth did the Indians have to do with the Mayflower Compact?<br/>

Uhhmmm&hellip;sure, Bill. You got it all figured out&hellip;so does your wife allow you to play on the computer or are you going to get into trouble?</p>
<p>Maybe you can get one of them submissive *Muslim women or *Asian women to fry your bacon.  </p>
<p>Most women respect a man who respects <strong>them</strong>.  Just because a woman wants equitable treatment doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s a screaming harridan.  This is America, ok?  Women fought for it, too.</p>
<p>And for your info, the only vote cast against that stupid proposal was by a (gasp) <span class="caps">WOMAN</span>!</p>

<p>Ted Kennedy an &#8220;ancestor&#8221; of the Puritans? Not even a descendent at that!  And an Irish Catholic no less. Criticize the Puritans if you must, but at least get your facts straight.<br/>

<p>&hellip;and isn&rsquo;t that funny, too?  They claim to hate us white men and call us bigots, but beg to us everytime they need something.</p>
<p>I wish we (white males) would let them know who butters their bread-or gives them special quotas and privileges.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>After Civil War Two is over, I want the job of running one of the labor camps to which the nation&rsquo;s Sarah Peakes will be sent.  The north slope of Alaska would be a good place for such a camp.  Ideally, we could have the inmates mining gold, like the Soviets did at Kolyma.  Since Marxists like Peake are generally in favor of things like labor camps for political prisoners, they will surely understand the need for camps once a different group of people are running the country.  Furthermore, the Sarah Peakes are at their happiest while they&rsquo;re being oppressed by heterosexual white males.</p>
<p>I promise that if given this job I will do a good job getting drunk each day while watching the inmates being worked to death.<br/>

<p>You&rsquo;re a genius man. An absolute Genius! Don&rsquo;t be surpised if someone doesnt agree&hellip; there&rsquo;s a fool born every minute.</p>
<p>I think you understate your case, when you say <sub>ladies have learned these techniques all thru high school and college</sub> Think of the Television hours alone, for starters. I think you&rsquo;re discounting the first 15 years of life. That&rsquo;s a lot of foolish wasted years&hellip; and we can&rsquo;t relive them.</p></font><p>Posted
