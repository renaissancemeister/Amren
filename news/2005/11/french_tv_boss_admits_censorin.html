<p><font size="3"><p>One of France&rsquo;s leading TV news executives has admitted censoring his coverage of the riots in the country for fear of encouraging support for far-right politicians. </p>
<p>Jean-Claude Dassier, the director general of the rolling news service LCI, said the prominence given to the rioters on international news networks had been &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; and could even be fanning the flames of the violence. </p>
<p>Mr Dassier said his own channel, which is owned by the private broadcaster TF1, recently decided not to show footage of burning cars. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Politics in France is heading to the right and I don&rsquo;t want rightwing politicians back in second, or even first place because we showed burning cars on television,&rdquo; Mr Dassier told an audience of broadcasters at the News Xchange conference in Amsterdam today. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Having satellites trained on towns across France 24 hours a day showing the violence would have been wrong and totally disproportionate &hellip; Journalism is not simply a matter of switching on the cameras and letting them roll. You have to think about what you&rsquo;re broadcasting,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Mr Dassier denied he was guilty of &ldquo;complicity&rdquo; with the French authorities, which this week invoked an extraordinary state-of-emergency law passed during the country&rsquo;s war with Algeria 50 years ago. </p>
<p>But he admitted his decision was partly motivated by a desire to avoid encouraging the resurgence of extreme rightwing views in France. </p>
<p>French broadcasters have faced criticism for their lack of coverage of the country&rsquo;s worst civil unrest in decades. Public television station France 3 has stopped broadcasting the numbers of torched cars while other TV stations are considering following suit. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we send teams of journalists because cars are burning, or are the cars burning because we sent teams of journalists?&rdquo; asked Patrick Lecocq, editor-in-chief of France 2. </p>
<p>Rival news organisations today questioned the French broadcasters&rsquo; decision to temper coverage of the riots. </p>
<p>John Ryley, the executive editor of Sky News, said his channel would have handled a similar story in Britain very differently. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We would have been all over it like a cheap suit. We would have monstered the story, and I didn&rsquo;t get the impression that happened in France,&rdquo; he said.</p></font>

<p><i>Jennifer Joan Lee, Washington Times, Nov. 10</font></i></p>
<p><p>ESSONNE, France &mdash; Government-ordered curfews imposed on France&rsquo;s troubled suburbs might have eased the storm of rioting that blazed through the country for 13 consecutive nights, but police who regularly patrol the country&rsquo;s troubled suburbs said the cause of the violence is far from extinguished. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the framework of the curfew law is broad enough to allow us to maybe stamp out the rioting,&rdquo; said Jean-Christophe Carme, head of the Action Police trade union. &ldquo;But enforcing measures that simply involve increased security does not solve the problem. The rioters were controlled by criminal gangs operating out of ghettos. And these ghettos remain no-go zones that have completely seceded from the republic.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr. Carme and his colleague Michel Thooris spoke to The Washington Times while patrolling the troubled region of Essonne, about 15 miles south of Paris. Stopping in front of a sprawling cluster of housing projects known as Les Tarterets, Mr. Thooris said it was one of the many ghettos that even police do not dare to enter. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is one of the most dangerous and violent housing projects in France,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also a cradle of radical Islam, controlled by professional criminals involved in drug and weapons trafficking and who have links to al Qaeda. We cannot even stop here for long because they are always surveying the area for police, and if they see us, there will be serious trouble.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As Mr. Thooris spoke, a car drove by slowly &mdash; twice. Mr. Thooris didn&rsquo;t hang around to find out why. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a classic ploy that&rsquo;s been happening all week,&rdquo; Mr. Carme said as he arrived on the scene while scanning the building&rsquo;s rooftops for falling objects. &ldquo;They set a fire, which brings in the firemen, and later, the police who always come as reinforcement. And when everyone is in place, they begin attacking, either shooting from the balconies and throwing rocks or other objects from the roof.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Not wanting to provoke the building&rsquo;s residents, Mr. Carme decided to leave the premises. On turning the corner, however, as feared, his car was pelted with rocks, hurled by a mob of youths on the street, apparently waiting for just such an opportunity.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>The Sky news guy is lying.  When the 7/7 terrorist bombings happened, the Blair regime and the entire UK media implemented a damage control operation that had been planned years in advance.  Essentially, all coverage of the events was carefully orchestrated to take attention off of the fact that non-white immigration is what brought the attackers to Britain and that the Iraq invasion was the primary motivation of the attackers.  </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>     Well, it seems that the French are not as stupid as we think they are. Their media at least has learned from our media how to ignore stories, cover them up, and downright lie. I would sooner believe something written in Grimm&rsquo;s Fairy Tales than I would something written in our rags. No wonder circulation is falling and viewership of major television newscasts is in the tank. Thank God for the internet.

  <font size="3"><p>       Mr. Dassier has forgotten his place and that is to report<br>
the news not make it. If he must consciously slant it, why doesn&rsquo;t he slant it in favor of his own people? Because that <br><br>
would be right wing, I suppose. And nothing is worse than that.<br><br>
But why is what&rsquo;s good for France so bad? Mr. Dassier and his<br><br>
fellow travelers have a lot of soul searching to do. And they<br><br>
wont be able to do it unless they can get beyond, above, or un-<br><br>
derneath words and phrases like Right, Left, Diversity, and see<br><br>
what&rsquo;s really going on. Some of words have no real meaning at<br><br>
all. Others do: they were created to confuse. Apart from any <br><br>
original and technical meaning in Marxism, that&rsquo;s what ideology<br><br>
is: ideas used as weapons to confuse and disempower. Diversity<br><br>
is the perfect example. It has no real meaning in the way the<br><br>
leftists use it. It&rsquo;s whole purpose is to silence and disempower<br><br>
Whites. As Confucius said, for Positve Social Change, the first<br><br>
step is &#8220;rectification of names&#8221;-everyone agreeing what words<br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>I thought officials in this country were spineless, but these people take the cake.  Nothing will be resolved in France by doing nothing.  The police being shot at and not returning fire is just plain stupid.  A few dead or wounded rioters would cool things down real fast, but these criminals know from experience they are safe from any action against them.  What a joke.  The citizens of France should not have to put up with this kind of senseless crime.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>Despite efforts to continue manipulating such looked down on citizens in France, my sense is that there in now a real awakening to the predicament France is in and there should finally be political consequences that will cause real problems for those who are trying to steadily destroy French society with their immigration and integration policies.</p></font><p>Posted

That&rsquo;s so typical of a liberal.

  <font size="3"><p>To Paul Jones, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This policy of selective reporting to advance the &lsquo;politically correct&rsquo; agenda is nothing new in the United States as well. The cultural elites don&rsquo;t really trust the lower class and lower-middle class whites, who they view still as &lsquo;Archie Bunker&rsquo; types (Remember him?)&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very interesting point made by you regarding the sickening disdain the so-called mainstream media holds for whites of lesser means, which has provoked a rather darkly <br>
amusing memory for me. I was once interviewed very briefly by a local television station, while walking home from a corner drugstore in my old white enclave neighborhood in Detroit, in my last year of college. The incident that had provoked the &ldquo;news&rdquo; media&rsquo;s attention, was a bomb threat indicating that the public elementary school I lived behind which had been converted into the Afrocentric &ldquo;Malcolm X Academy&rdquo; for bussed in black boy only and excluding the local white children, was targeted for destruction. </p>
<p>The establishment of this so-called academy had been the source of much angry controversy, since the black Detroit &ldquo;establishments&rdquo; response was to have the neighborhood&rsquo;s one other already overcrowded  public school serve as the local alternative, or to bus the white children into black dominated schools. As you can imagine, my neighborhood which was made up mostly of families headed by Detroit Policemen and Firefighters, along with other working class whites employed in the auto industry or at its periphery, was portrayed in the &ldquo;local&rdquo; media as nothing but a bunch of  ignorant &ldquo;racist&rdquo; rednecks and Eastern and Southern European white ethnic troglodytes. </p>
<p>Never mind that when the plan was originally proposed and subsequently criticized by white parents in the neighborhood as being invasively untenable, that a black City Council or School Board Member (I honestly can&rsquo;t remember which) declared something along the lines of, &lsquo;the whites living there are either too poor or stupid to get out of our city&hellip;&rsquo; was the generalized abusive reaction of &ldquo;official&rdquo; Detroit, it was our &ldquo;racism&rdquo; that was focused upon. At the crescendo of the of the whole &ldquo;debate&rdquo; on if it was wise to establish the &ldquo;academy&rdquo; of negritude in our midst and at our expense, the story actually began to make national headlines; the low point being the &ldquo;unbiased&rdquo; Sally Jessy Raphel, doing a show on the subject, with the most inarticulate and un-photogenic white parents she could find from the neighborhood to debate well dressed black parents and Commissars who supported the project. </p>
<p>In the end, the Mau Maus had their way and the Marxist voodoo indoctrination temple was established, with much glowing accolades and hoopla by the so-called local media. However, the people who actually lived in neighborhood were totally disgusted, including the very few black families who lived there and had daughters that were facing the same options as the white children. Thus, we have the background info for my 15 seconds of fame, via a bomb threat.</p>
<p>So there I was walking back home after a short break from studying for exams, unshaven (I have a rather heavy beard) with an open plaid flannel shirt as a jacket over a rock tee-shirt and jeans, when a rather attractive woman suddenly jumped out of &ldquo;channel X&rsquo;s&rdquo;  parked van and briskly asked, &lsquo;can I talk with you, some one called the police and threatened to blow up the school here,&rsquo; as I was walking past it. I said, &lsquo;sure why not&rsquo; only to have her rush back to the van and come back with a grinning video cameraman and her holding a microphone. They both exchanged glances and smiled at each other and I could practically read their minds, &ldquo;we got us a caveman in a ball cap, chuckle, chuckle, chuckle,&hellip;&rdquo; On went the camera and News Bimbo thrust the microphone and asks something like:</p>
<p>&lsquo;you live here in the neighborhood?&rsquo;</p>
<p>John PM: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>News Bimbo: &lsquo;Do you really think that the threat by your neighbors to blow up the school is a serious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>John PM smiling on the verge of laughter: &ldquo;No this is probably just a prank by some hoodlums, you know kids with too much time on their hands or something. While it is unfortunate that this school was commandeered at the expense of the families who live here, we are not crazy enough to blow it up since it is our own backyard, for goodness sake I live right on the next block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>News Bimbo frowning with mild confusion: &lsquo;Do you think it is sad that someone would even suggest something like this, or do you think it is acceptable?&rsquo;</p>
<p>John PM now frowning a bit myself and mild consternation in my voice: &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t think it is acceptable, like I just said it is probably just pranking hooligans and they might not even live in the neighborhood here or even the city, who knows who called in the threat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>News Bimbo frowning harder: &lsquo;So you do think it is sad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>John PM smiling a bit wryly now: &ldquo;Sure I do, it is sad that in a city with a crime rate like ours the police have to be bothered with such nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that point the interview ended and I asked when or if the interview would be aired. I was told the likely time, but that it would probably be edited. With that we exchanged quick pleasantries of &ldquo; thanks for your time,&rdquo; and &ldquo;your welcome,&rdquo; and I was on my way.</p>
<p>I watched the news on channel at the time specified and guess what? The interview was aired and as promised &ldquo;edited.&rdquo; It was introduced by the anchorman with an explanation of the bomb threat and the remark, &ldquo;however, residents of the neighborhood feel the threat is probably a hoax.&rdquo; Cut to News Bimbo and yours truly:</p>
<p>News Bimbo: &lsquo;Do you really think that the threat by your neighbors to blow up the school is a serious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>John PM smiling on the verge of laughter: &ldquo;No this is probably just a prank by some hoodlums, you know kids with too much time on their hands or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was that, except that I had a dentist appointment the following Monday, and was told by the receptionist and dental hygienist that I looked &ldquo;very handsome on TV the other night,&rdquo; with some banter and laughter about the whole incident, including my take on the baiting questions and &ldquo;editing&rdquo; job. </p>
<p>As for Archie Bunker, it was once observed by my youngest sibling that while Archie was the reviled &ldquo;racist&rdquo; buffoon of the show, he also was the sole support of the Meathead, Ding Bat, and Little Girl who often felt compelled to criticize and reeducate him. I found this to be quite amusing and responded that while this was true, Archie never really did any harm to anyone either, he only expressed his opinions and didn&rsquo;t expect anyone to agree with him, only to leave him the heck alone when he got home from work. That got a laugh out of kid sibling.</p>
<p>Best wishes to you Paul Jones,</p>

  <font size="3"><p>   &hellip;&#8221;he admitted his decision was partly motivated by a desire to avoid encouraging the resurgence of extreme rightwing views in France. <br>
France 3 has stopped broadcasting the numbers of torched cars while other TV stations are considering following suit. French broadcasters have faced criticism for their lack of coverage of the country&rsquo;s worst civil unrest in decades.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, he&rsquo;s admitting that he&rsquo;s not running a news agency, but a propaganda agency.  <br>
Here, at least, our media try to pretend that they&rsquo;re objective and would indignantly deny any attempts to influence the news.<br><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p> &#8220;The rioters were controlled by criminal gangs operating out of ghettos. .. these ghettos remain no-go zones <span class="caps">THAT HAVE COMPLETELY SECEDED FROM THE REPUBLIC&hellip;.</span>the many ghettos that even police do not dare to enter. &ldquo;This is one of the most dangerous and violent housing projects in France,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also a cradle of radical Islam, controlled by professional criminals involved in drug and weapons trafficking and who have links to al Qaeda. Not wanting to provoke the building&rsquo;s residents, Mr. Carme decided to leave.. On turning the corner, his car was pelted with rocks, hurled by a mob of youths. &#8220;</p>
<p>Here is an open admission that they have carved out in these &#8220;ghettos&#8221; little self-ruling colonies on French soil that already enjoy de facto extraterritorial rights and are not subject to French laws or authority. No sovereign country can tolerate that. If left alone, these colonies can only grow.  And any media or political personage who tries to deny this or ignores it is a traitor to his country.</p>
<p>Somewhere I read (perhaps a poster on <span class="caps">BBC</span>) that the real cause of these riots was in the decision of Sarkozy to get tough and clamp down on crime (in the housing projects). It seems the criminal gangs who rule there object to any police presence on their turf which a). infringes on their &#8220;authority,&#8221; and b). interferes in their conduct of business. He stated that this really had nothing to do whatsoever with the deaths of the two &#8220;boys&#8221; who got themselves electrocuted, but that these deaths served merely as a convenient pretext.</p>
<p>It remains completely unexplained why these &#8220;boys&#8221; were allegedly &#8220;hiding from the police&#8221; (which the police deny) in an electrical power station. One person suggested that they were there to strip copper wiring to sell, or for anything else they could steal. It has been established that they were known to the police and already had criminal records for burglary and forcible robbery. Nice kids! A couple of Diversity&rsquo;s contributions to the enrichment of  French society.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>This is a typical example of &#8220;liberal&#8221; trend to shamelessly restrict individual liberties (like free speech) in the name of their &#8220;higher cause&#8221;. They shoud not be called &#8220;liberals&#8221; but &#8220;shameless restrictionists&#8221;, and political left should be called political wrong, instead.</p>
<p>Statistically, a person of conservative orientation will be very likely to commit himself to truth and liberty, while a liberal will be only committed to his political agenda of social re-engineering of Western countries. Remember that many &#8220;liberal&#8221; scholars went as far as to deny the very existence of objective truth (this trend is called &#8220;post-modernism&#8221;), despite the fact that the concept of truth has been well defined and researched by the most gifted logicians, philosophers, matematicians, and set-theoreticians our civilization ever had.</p>
<p>This &#8220;liberal&#8221; pattern instantiated itself in the most obvious form by Marxist-Leninist doctrine that defined &#8220;good&#8221; as anything that promotes communism. Most of &#8220;liberals&#8221; may not be that extreme in their views, but they are half way there.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p><b>It remains completely unexplained why these &ldquo;boys&rdquo; were allegedly &ldquo;hiding from the police&rdquo; (which the police deny) in an electrical power station.</b></p>
<p>They often run because many carry something illegal in their pockets, most of the time hashich, knives, or stolen mobiles. Or because they don&rsquo;t have their identity card. By that way, policemen have less chance to catch a delinquent or a thoughtless 14 year-old wanderer. It&rsquo;s also a game to be chased by authorities. Moreover, you have to remember that the survivor, Muttin, is an &#8220;undocumented&#8221; immigrant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason otherwise. You show your ID to the police, such as your card, your driving licence, or your passport, and that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p><i>In France, the media might&rsquo;ve cleansed the riot coverage, but the French people in the banlieus and elswhere saw with their own eyes just who was doing the rioting.</i></p>
<p>Yes, I can tell you they saw and they appreciated even in peaceful communities. Several of my neighbors parked their cars far from their homes as two have already been torched nearby. One has been waiting behind the half-opened window of his living room, a spade near the front door. He looked funny since the weather&rsquo;s rather fresh now, but he didn&rsquo;t smile at all (nor I). Nothing more happened.</p>
<p>What surprised me is that a car is almost completely consumed in about half an hour and doesn&rsquo;t make neither much noise nor many flames. Fortunately these ones were fueled with gas-oil as it is common in France and not gasoline.</p>
<p>Of course French will remember this festival, but it won&rsquo;t be enough. For they didn&rsquo;t burn the cars of well-to-do do-gooders most of the time.</p></font><p>Posted

<i>Obvious that the left has infiltrated the media in France as well as the <span class="caps">USA</span></i></p>
<p>I believe that it is actually the other way round – that it is the media in control and (sooner or later) everyone else in politics or public life has to come around to serve their agenda, or face censorship or ruin.  Most of our elected representatives and the unelected government officials that run the daily administration in the <span class="caps">USA </span>and Western Europe rely on media support to keep them in power (by backing them up, and fooling enough of the people enough of the time to go along with things).  There is an alliance here – between liberals, media, communists, or whoever – but whose purpose is really being served by this?</p>
<p>Reflect for a moment, has not one particular section of the media (entertainment i.e. <span class="caps">TV,</span> Film, and Popular Music) been the driving force in the decline of morality in the western world over the last fifty years – not simply at the &lsquo;cutting edge&rsquo; but in fact constantly &lsquo;pushing new boundaries&rsquo;?</p>
<p>And, for a classic case-study of how voters are won and lost, I suggest look at last recent elections in the Ukraine (in the former <span class="caps">USSR</span>) and how George Soros invested $millions to set up media and campaign groups to influence opinion.</p>
<p>Or, an up-to-the-minute example is the defeat for Arnold Schwarzenegger in the California elections.  Despite spending $5-6m of his own money on the campaign, this was dwarfed by what the media and its supporters had available.  (And if they didn&rsquo;t have it to hand, then apparently some such as the public service unions were able to borrow for the campaign – they must have thought it important!)  Inspite of all his efforts and no mean expenditure of his own money, how many reading this know anything at all about his campaigns (unless you were following it specifically).<br>
Crucial to this, his messages were completely ignored by the media so it was assured he would not be heard by the majority.  And now we find, today he has to apologise, asking forgiveness and agreeing to toe the media line, if he wants a future.  Overall, the <span class="caps">USA</span> Election Day results only demonstrate the power and influence of the main stream media and prove unfortunately that they are still very much have the upper hand!</p>

<p>Absolutely!  When I see the news reported, I often think to myself – and I&rsquo;m sure many other readers must feel the same - if only I had my own news outlet, be it a TV station or a newspaper, with the resources of any of today&rsquo;s mainstream outlets, I would present a different perspective and I&rsquo;m damned sure I could change public opinion and bring this whole edifice crashing down it no time!<br>

<p>To ghw :  Lets be honest   &mdash;   you meant that as a rhetorical question, right ?  A question asked belatedly, perhaps 200 years too late? One of the features about evolution ( specifically, human intelligence ) is that it can take place surreptitiously, clandestinely, and in sudden spurts, rather than at a steady, leisurely pace, and by definition would not be readily apparent to the casual observer. In other words, people who are <span class="caps">REALLY </span>smarter than you are <span class="caps">NOT </span>going to publicise that fact   &mdash;   because to do so would be politically just plain suicidal and self-defeating.   Look at all the posts here on amren which repeatedly extoll the superiority of white technical achievements of recent centuries ( ad nauseum ) as some sort of moral bulwark against the encroachments of the non - whites.  I&rsquo;ve been on this site long enough to know that they never tire of reiterating whites invented this and that, responsible for space travel, splitting of the atom, mass transit, aircraft carriers, defeat of the Nazis, washing machines, computers, Mom&rsquo;s apple pie, the internet, the ipod..etc.. yadda yadda yadda   &mdash;   and yet whites don&rsquo;t control their own <span class="caps">MEDIA </span>?  The very instrument which which to convey to the next generation their nations&rsquo; historical<br>
accomplishments, identity, and cultural moorings ?  C&rsquo;mon, whats wrong with this picture ? </p>
<p>I happen to agree with some posters here that Asians can&rsquo;t compete with whites in the purely creative, scientific arena. But so what ? Do you think that technical achievements alone will save the Europeans from their own self - destruction ?  I know some idiot savants who can calculate to the hour when a solar eclipse occurred 3000 years ago, and yet can&rsquo;t even tie their shoe laces or keep from getting mugged while going to the neighborhood store for a bottle of milk.  Because that involves a <span class="caps">DIFFERENT TYPE </span>of intelligence   &mdash;   a more primitive, Darwinian &#8221; street savvy &#8221; which most non - whites have in abundance, and employ to great effect to manipulate the naive white European, who is so terrified of being called a &#8221; racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>I dont have a crystal ball, so I dont know how things will play out in this century as far as the European race is concerned. But I know one thing about Asians   &mdash;   they will never form the noose with which to hang themselves with.  As stupid as they may be, they know exactly what mother nature requires of them for their  long term survival. Oh, by the way, the media in Japan is controlled by the <span class="caps">JAPANESE </span>  &mdash;   we never have to ask &#8221; who? &#8221;  Asians have long instinctively admired Europeans, but these days they feel like embarrassed voyeurs, watching a slow - motion train wreck   &mdash;   they just can&rsquo;t believe what they are seeing !</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>&#8220;It is very rare for a nation to be given a second chance&#8221;</p>
<p>   - Enoch Powell.</p>
<p><br>
Looking upon the recent racial violence in France with a cold, dispassionate eye, it is evident that within the lifetime of many reading these words two outcomes are likely to unfold:</p>
<p>1/.An endogenous &#8220;Gallic&#8221; movement will arise from the native ethnic French, possibly under a charismatic leader, and will tap into a deep sense of unease and disgust amongst the real French - who are able to sense and fear their eventual subjugation and dispossession.THe movement might actually gain political control of the French state - and actually start to institute policies congenial to the survival of that ancient nation and of the Gallic stock.*Most unlikely*</p>
<p>2/. With a liklehood way in excess of 95%, France will continue on the same path as it has done for the last 50 years.tHe hostile, non-White portion of the population will continue to grow in numbers, through mass immigration,as their numbers grow they will get more cocky and nasty.The political class will continue to favor the non-Whites through privelege and legal protection - while at the same time vilifying and destroying any &#8220;Gallic&#8221; movement by the most ruthless and underhand methods possible.<br>
The French will simply &#8220;roll over and die&#8221; - while being kicked all the way down by the Blacks and Arabs.</p>
<p>As recently as 2000 The French prime minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenment set in place plans for 75 million non-Whites to enter &#8220;Europe&#8221;.Why in God&rsquo;s name should we sympathise or even care for such a people who can elect creatures such as this to office?</p>
<p>THe best the French asituation can do is to offer an object lesson to those White nations currently embarking on policies of nassive non-White replacement immigration (Eg Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Canada), of what the future has in store and for those nations as as yet untainted (Eastern, Central Europe),to provide a warning.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Afte reading and watching approximately 2 weeks worth of immigrant rioting in France, one can&rsquo;t help but wonder if the French people have had their manhood and sense of national honor somehow <span class="caps">BRED OUT</span> OF <span class="caps">THEM </span>over the past sixty years since WW <span class="caps">II.</span></p>
<p>I find it an utter absurdity that no French official has the b***s to speak the obvious: That his is nothing more than a criminal element engaging in criminal acts to be dealt with accordingly.</p>
<p>France does not <span class="caps">OWE </span>these immigrants, legal or illegal a single thing! They are in France at France&rsquo; suffrance and need to conduct themselves in accordance with French law. By looting and rioting the very least France should do is stage mass deportations   &mdash;   letting the left wing liberal media videotape and photograph hundreds of African youths in shackles, being carried into aircraft and ships for imminent deportation.</p>
<p>Would any sane, logical person claim the French are <span class="caps">NOT </span>entitled to use deadly force, if necessary, to end this insanity? Maybe what France needs is a new government and a new constitution   &mdash;   one that places very strict limits on the amount of immigrants it takes in!

  <font size="3"><p>Canal+ is doing something similar with their web-coverage.  As we all know, the official Western <span class="caps">MSM </span>position on the riots is that they are a spontaneous upheaval against white racism and economic privation.  The notion that the violence could be an extension of the global Muslim religio-ethnic agenda is being totally ignored.</p>
<p>So when Canal+ put some subtitled riot footage on their website they presented clearly audible cries of &#8220;Sarkozy, sale Juif&#8221; (&#8220;Sarkozy, dirty Jew&#8221;) as &#8220;Sarkozy, fasciste!&#8221;  Nobody likes fascists, so portraying the rampaging Africans as having anti-fascist tendencies makes them considerably more sympathetic than telling the truth about their Islamic standard-fare conflated anti-Zionism/Judeophobia would.  The network, of course, pretended not to hear the many voices yelling &#8220;Allah u akbar&#8221; on the video.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Minorityman - excellent comment.  I&rsquo;ve been trying to say the exact same you are saying for a long time.  But it is difficult to get through to the people when there are so many traps laid in our way.  We are like the 15th century european peasants trying to lead a rebellion against a coalition of privilidged aristocrats and their allies.  It&rsquo;s an old story in european history and it hasn&rsquo;t been resolved yet.</p>
<p>I think several things have happened which have led us to the point where whites are becoming demographically displaced everywhere:<br>
(a) <span class="caps">WW2 </span>and its horrors has led the white elites to abandon their nationalistic thinking and buy into a utopian type vision of earthly brotherhood (&#8216;diversity&rsquo;).  This clearly shows a lack of intelligence and creativity on the part of our elites - which is truly scary.<br><br>
(b) European derived people severly underestimated the power of mass communication and propaganda effects in the second half of 20th century -i.e. the power of media.  They failed to derived practical policies which would reflect in their own laws, and  that would protect them from hostile powers.<br><br>
&#169; Extension of (b) - European derived people failed to realize that the wars of the early 20th century shifted from the physical battlefield to the communication field.  They allowed the race-replacement campaign to happen through their own trusted communication sources.  Their demographic transfomation is a direct result of this lack of awareness.<br><br>
(d) There are clearly suicidal and homicidal elements <span class="caps">WITHIN </span>western society and they hold the upper hand.  Until the rest of the whites lose their fear and identify these elements no real reform is possible - including mass communication reform. Schools and universities teaching about the evil of the western man, while praisining everyone else,  clearly illustrates an example of this point.<br><br>
(e) Euro derived elites have been bought off by europ-hating elemets. Their corruption is obvious to anyone with any amount of intelligence. Maybe at some point in the past they had the power to turn this thing around, but I have lost faith that the Euro-derived elites - <span class="caps">WASP</span>s, Euro-industrialists, etc&hellip; have the abilty to do anything at this point.  Watch current movies and/or TV shows and see how much aggression they take through jokes and moralistic examples.  This clearly shows weakness and their inabilty to see what is going on.  I go to <span class="caps">WASP </span>dinners these days where our so called &#8216;elites&rsquo; make fun of themselves based on propaganda efforts on the television.  It is truly pathetic.</p>
<p>The problem is that we are not going to stop or reverse the demographic situation until several things happen:<br>
(a) Whites convince themselves that they deserve to exist.  This has to be an intellectual process / transformation that comes from within. Nothing further can happen until whites believe that they have a place on this earth - in their current form.<br><br>
(b) A critical mass of white intellectual elite decides to make a stand against the aggression against them and for their survival.<br><br>
&#169; Whites start organizing in practical groups based on solid survival stategies.<br><br>
(d) The group effort is transformed into victories at the political, economical, media levels etc..</p>
<p>If whites don&rsquo;t want to, or can&rsquo;t go through this process, then they will disappear.  And there really isn&rsquo;t anything wrong with the weak (those unable to adapt) disappearing - and I say that as a white.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p><i>If it is the media in control, then who is in control of the media?</i><br>
My post was meant seriously – and to Minorityman I think the question from ghw was meant the same?</p>
<p>A short and rather glib answer would be: it is an alliance of individuals and groups sharing common self-interests.  This is not a fixed set, members come and go as alliances and priorities change, and as both wealth and politcal power is won or lost.  Nor is it any one race or religion (indeed, in the western world, whites probably do make up the greater part of this group).  No-one else controls the media – the &ldquo;controllers&rdquo; are within.</p>
<p>To explain a little more:</p>
<p>In all organised societies (except perhaps absolute dictatorships), there must be a &ldquo;ruling class&rdquo; – a group of people who have their hands on the levers of power best of all and who are able to shape the policies and future of that society to suit themselves.  They don&rsquo;t necessarily have to own all the means of production (industry) or run the government directly, but just be able to use them most successfully to their own ends.</p>
<p>For example, in 1550&rsquo;s England, Queen Elizabeth I was on the throne (no surprise there!)  You might think she &ldquo;ruled&rdquo; alongside her Parliament.  But that didn&rsquo;t prevent the newly wealthy merchants and &ldquo;gentry&rdquo; from very effectively pursuing their own agenda.  That is to say, fixing the Privy Council (roughly equivalent to the President&rsquo;s Cabinet) to approve &ldquo;voyages of discovery&rdquo; and &ldquo;patents for colonisation&rdquo; for a place that was eventually came to be named, Virginia.  In reality, these were just permits to enable them to venture out in search of greater trade and wealth in the New World – full in the knowledge this would bring the country into conflict with the Spanish empire.  Her Majesty took great interest in these expeditions, lent money and sent one of her own ships when she could afford, but she was surely not the instigator.  Moving on to the 1600&rsquo;s, we find a troublesome monarch (Charles I) who wouldn&rsquo;t comply so had to be given the &#8220;chop&#8221;. Into the 1800&rsquo;s, you might be forgiven for thinking England was &ldquo;governed&rdquo; by Parliament with assistance from the Monarchy.  No, I say it was actually the bankers and industrialists; carving up the landscape, first with canals and waterways, then railways, mining, heavy industry, and whole new cities! Then, an empire!<br>
  <br><br>
As Minorityman writes, this is rarely overt control and neither is it total power. There is a balance that relies on mutual support. (If governments have the will, they may yet do things that the &ldquo;elite&rdquo; don&rsquo;t approve of – like going into Iraq. Of course, the media will not miss an opportunity to screw it up – they are only waiting and watching for their chance.)</p>
<p>So at the risk of stating the obvious, with our present-day form of government, if the media has control over public information then the media has hold over public opinion and therefore ultimately the media has power over the direction of governments.</p>
<p>So, who is included, besides the obvious – a lot of those who own or at the top of or just plain work in the main stream media networks, news, press and publishing, arts and entertainment, film and tv industries, pop-stars, fashion-models, sports-celebrities, the sex-industry etc.? </p>
<p>Of one thing I am sure, all those who &ldquo;rise to the top&rdquo;, who find themselves in a position of wealth or advantage whether by their own endeavours or by accident of birth, if they want to keep that status then sooner or later they have to ally themselves with the Ruling Class.  Some, like Bill and Hilary, embrace it for all it is worth; others I suspect come to the club a little less enthusiastically but are nevertheless obliged to contribute to the appropriate causes (at least half the UN World Health Organization budget is financed by private foundations and industry).  I am sure the generousity of Bill and Melinda is genuine, so it is reassuring to see amongst all the other good causes, such as the $billions for polio and malaria, they have not forgotten to include $100m for <span class="caps">AIDS.</span></p>
<p>Who is excluded &hellip; I&rsquo;ll stop rambling on now, apologies for going on so long, hope its not too far off topic - and I&rsquo;ll leave you to have some fun working out your own lists</p>
<p>PS This website seems to explore the issue further if you are interested:<br>
https://www.radical-and-right.org/20050922.html</p>
<p><span class="caps">PPS</span> The internet – and especially sites like this one - present a new challenge to this &lsquo;existing order&rsquo;.  Why else would both the UN and the European Union be so interested in trying to take over control of the administration of the internet?<br>

  <font size="3"><p>I just want to say I find all the post on this topic today very intresting. Yes the intellectual lazyiness of the left is astounding. What is even more scary though is the complete PC facism that controls all debates regarding race. According to the left people who formely lived in huts and use feces to cook their food can some how assimilate into any western society and become citizens just like the rest of us. Of course if they choose not to assimilate, not that I think they could if they wanted to, they are still entitled to evey from of welfare the left can dream up for life. Exactly how any of that is good for the nation has never been explained in any real way, only that you are supposed to see the all the wonders of diversity and if you don&rsquo;t you are a mentally defeciant racist. I would like to know exactly why every 3rd worlder is entilted to citizenship even if they are not capable of functioning in our society. Is it because Indians used to live on our land? Is it because of Hitler? Is that why Americans must give up eveything they have built to 3rd worlders? If that is the case than Hitler is the best thing that ever happend to the non whites of the world. How come according to the PC religon just asking such a question makes you a bad person? Of coures the left is simply terrified of any real debate regarding race, there for they must not let any debate gain legitimicy because they know they would lose. They know once the ball starts rolling in the opposite direction and all the damage they have done to our nation is exposed for all to see they will be exposed as the deranged frauds they are. Sadly though most Americans still belive in the guilty of being white charge. But as things get worse we gain legitimicy so there is still hope.</p></font><p>Posted
