                learning about race riots in British cities like Bradford and 
                Oldham may have the impression that disturbances of this kind 
                are new to Britain. In fact, the history of British race relations 
                is littered with riots. During the 19th century, there were several 
                race riots in port cities, where small numbers of black immigrants 
                were concentrated. In 1919, during violent disturbances in Liverpool, 
                several black people were killed and hundreds moved to police 
                stations for their own safety. It was only to be expected that 
                the massive increase in the numbers of non-white immigrants after 
                1945 would mean yet more rioting, but such elementary reasoning 
                seems to have been beyond most senior politicians in the post-war 
                period.</font></p>

              <p><font size="3">Since 1958, when large numbers 
                of blacks rioted in London&rsquo;s Notting Hill, there have been racial 
                disturbances somewhere in the UK <i>every year. </i>Many incidents 
                are small and covered only in local newspapers, but some get national 
                attention. During the 1980s, there were large-scale riots in Toxteth 
                (Liverpool), Handsworth (Birmingham), Brixton and Broadwater Farm 
                (both in London). The Broadwater Farm riot became infamous when 
                enthusiastic blacks chopped Police Constable Keith Blakelock to 
                death with machetes &mdash; a tragedy the local Labour MP dismissed as 
                the police getting &quot;a bloody good hiding.&quot; </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">So far this year, the northern 
                towns of Bradford, Oldham, Leeds, Accrington, Burnley, Manchester, 
                and Stoke-on-Trent have all had race riots, but with a new twist: 
                the rioters are Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims rather than 
                young blacks. Increased diversity has brought a diversity of rioters.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The most serious violence took 
                place in Bradford, Oldham and Burnley &mdash; all bleak, depressed towns 
                that depended on the now-vanished textile industry, and have large 
                Asian populations. In his 1933 <i>English Journey</i>, the socialist 
                writer J. B. Priestley, a Bradfordian himself, wrote that &quot;a 
                few were rich and a great many were very poor, working from morning 
                to night for miserable wages, but they were all one lot of folk.&quot; 
                This could not be said now.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">In modern Bradford, about 16 percent 
                of the population are what the race relations industry sometimes 
                refers to as British of Sub-Continental Origin &mdash; although the relatively 
                small Hindu quotient was involved in the rioting only as victims. 
                Like many other towns in this blighted region, Bradford is segregated, 
                with a white underclass in the suburbs and a Muslim underclass 
                in the inner city. There are no fewer than 63 private Muslim schools 
                attached to Bradford&rsquo;s mosques, and the local government is about 
                to open Britain&rsquo;s first state-run Muslim secondary school. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">There has been tension for some 
                time. Race riots in 1995 were bad enough to prompt a now-forgotten 
                government-sponsored report. In 1998, Bradford was in the headlines 
                again when Muslim vigilantes expelled white prostitutes from Manningham, 
                the Muslim part of town. Manningham does not seem to have improved; 
                it was at the center of the recent violence. Tensions had been 
                high since April, when a fight at a Hindu wedding sparked rumors 
                of general attacks on Muslims.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Bradford is described by its town 
                council as &quot;vibrant, diverse and full of surprises.&quot; 
                Thousands of na&iuml;ve journalists, politicians and vicars were 
                certainly surprised when the vibrancy and diversity reached new 
                heights over three nights in early July, resulting in over £25 
                million worth of damage, 65 arrests (with more likely to follow), 
                and over 200 police officers injured. </font></p>

              <p><font size="3">Why did this happen? According 
                to the editor of the <i>Bradford Telegraph and Argus</i>, who 
                probably knows the city as well as anyone, Muslims have a &quot;fundamental 
                and deep-seated hatred of white people and of authority in general.&quot; 
                Even the <i>Times</i> noted that not all is well: &quot;white 
                shopkeepers, Hindu families and Ukrainian &eacute;migr&eacute;s 
                &hellip; know through bitter experience that they are not welcome 
                to trade, live or meet socially in predominantly Asian inner city 
                suburbs &lsquo;policed&rsquo; by young Muslims who are prepared to back threats 
                and intimidation with violence.&quot;</font></p>

              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <div align="left"></div>
              <p><font size="3">But it was Oldham that probably 
                received the most attention from panic-stricken journalists and 
                politicians. It has an Asian population of approximately 11 percent, 
                which is expected to increase to 17 percent by 2011, and trouble 
                has been brewing all year. In January, the <i>Oldham Chronicle 
                </i>publicized police figures that showed six out of every ten 
                racial attacks in the area were carried out <i>against </i>whites. 
                Given the relatively small percentage of Asians, these figures 
                mean that any given Asian is about 12 times more likely to assault 
                a white for racial reasons than the reverse. The <i>Chronicle</i> 
                published several factual stories about race attacks against whites, 
                and made an understandable fuss in April when young Asians beat 
                up a 76-year-old D-Day veteran, Walter Chamberlain. Later in April, 
                there were skirmishes between local Asians and an unpleasant group 
                of white football fans from out of town. Oldham began to attract 
                national interest. In May, the Home Secretary banned rallies by 
                both the anti-immigrant National Front and the communist Anti-Nazi 
                League.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Tensions finally boiled over in 
                three nights of rioting from May 26 to May 29, with approximately 
                500 Asians fighting police and firebombing buildings, including 
                the offices of the <i>Oldham Chronicle</i> (see July issue of 
                AR). This might have remained a regional news story except that 
                in the Parliamentary elections on June 7, the British National 
                Party achieved unprecedented results in the two Oldham constituencies. 
                In Oldham East &amp; Saddleworth, the BNP candidate won 11.2 percent 
                of the vote, while the party&rsquo;s leader Nick Griffin polled 16.4 
                percent in Oldham West &amp; Royston. Neither candidate won a 
                seat, but both finished quite respectably in three- and four-way 
                races. This was the signal for a frenzy of politically correct 
                outrage.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Naturally, everyone wanted to 
                blame the BNP &mdash; even though it ran candidates in Oldham only because 
                riots had <i>already </i>broken out there &mdash; and there were calls 
                from Labour MPs for the party to be banned. People also blamed 
                the police for being &quot;heavy-handed&quot; and having &quot;racist 
                attitudes.&quot; Others blamed the Conservatives or &quot;social 
                deprivation&quot; or &quot;Islamophobia.&quot; A few Asians said 
                their young people were just copying the white underclass and 
                that &quot;Western culture&quot; was the real problem. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Some people said the <i>Oldham 
                Chronicle</i> should never have publicized the initial anti-white 
                attacks. Others said the problem was self-segregated schools. 
                An article in the <i>Times Educational Supplement</i> blamed the 
                two Church of England secondary schools because prospective pupils 
                must get references from their vicars, which is not convenient 
                for Muslims. Ritualistic and predictable denunciations continue, 
                as Leftists tie themselves in knots trying to avoid the real issue, 
                which is the intractable fact of multi-racialism.</font></p>
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p><font size="3"><b>Proposed &lsquo;Solutions&rsquo;</b></font></p>
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p><font size="3">So how is Britain to avoid more 
                riots? In a report, <i>Community Pride &mdash; Not Prejudice</i>, that 
                had been commissioned by the Bradford Council prior to the riots 
                and was published hurriedly on July 12, the former head of the 
                Commission for Racial Equality described the city as &quot;the 
                ultimate challenge in race relations in Britain,&quot; and agonized 
                about &quot;virtual apartheid.&quot; Sir Herman Ouseley&rsquo;s proposed 
                solutions to the &quot;ultimate challenge&quot; were the usual 
                nonsense: Promote special skills in &quot;intercultural awareness 
                and interaction;&quot; set up a Centre for Diversity, Learning 
                and Living; count how many minorities work for local government. 
                This sort of thing will only antagonise whites and do little to 
                assuage Asian feelings of alienation. As the <i>Yorkshire Post</i> 
                put it: &quot;Bradford desperately needs inward investment, but 
                the only industry to gain from Lord Ouseley&rsquo;s recommendations 
                will be the race relations industry &hellip; .&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Others had equally unhelpful ideas. 
                These ranged from Home Secretary David Blunkett&rsquo;s proposal of 
                more sports and arts frestivals, to the suggestion of Newcastle-upon-Tyne&rsquo;s 
                council that Bradford should copy a feel-good festival they call 
                &quot;Love Parade.&quot; David Blunkett has also set up a &quot;special 
                ministerial team,&quot; a classic way for Whitehall to defer action 
                on a problem until everyone has forgotten about it.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Aside from a few lonely voices 
                on the &quot;extreme&quot; right, virtually no one is prepared 
                to admit publicly that the real problem is large-scale, non-white 
                immigration combined with aggressive multicultural indoctrination 
                that discriminates against the English. A gaping, possibly unbridgeable 
                social fault line has opened where none existed before, thanks 
                to foolishness and misplaced &quot;humanitarianism&quot; on the 
                Left, and cowardly acquiescence on the Right. No one is prepared 
                to point out the obvious: Race riots happen only in multi-racial 
                societies. Immigration has made Britain multi-racial. Immigration 
                must therefore stop or be slowed to a socially beneficial trickle.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Yet, amid all the patent nonsense 
                about the riots, there were glimmers of light, even in Labour 
                circles. Both Prime Minister Tony Blair and David Blunkett said 
                the problem had much more to do with &quot;thuggery&quot; on the 
                part of Muslim youths than anything else, presumably including 
                &quot;racism.&quot; A Yorkshire Labour MP, Ann Cryer, actually 
                suggested language tests for Asian immigrants (except for elderly 
                relatives). The Asian Labour MP for Bradford West, Marsha Singh, 
                who in the 1980s defended young Asians who stockpiled petrol bombs, 
                said the police should blast rioters with water cannon. A prominent 
                Bradford Hindu was at least partly right when he said mosques 
                are &quot;less religious centres, more like training grounds for 
                the Taliban.&quot; One can only hope such glimmers of light gather 
                strength as the &quot;rainbow coalition&quot; continues to unravel.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">On June 30, the left-of-center 
                <i>Independent</i> newspaper wondered about yet another part of 
                the depressed Northwest: &quot;Is Nelson another town ready to 
                blow?&quot; The same question could be asked of many other British 
                cities, and if the country fails to grapple with the underlying 
                problems of immigration and multiracialism, the question is likely 
                to be answered sooner rather than later &mdash; and in the affirmative.
