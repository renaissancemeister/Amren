<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black and Arab rappers advocate treating France like a whore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, what is it you&rsquo;re waiting for to start the fire? / The years go by, but everything is still the same / Which makes me ask, how much longer can it last?&rdquo; </p>
<p>The words are from the 1995 song They Don&rsquo;t Understand, by one of France&rsquo;s best-known rap singers, Joey Starr of the group NTM. </p>
<p>He was far from alone in providing a grim prophecy of the events of the last three weeks. </p>
<p>Take these lines from the song In Front Of The Police, by the group 113: </p>
<p>&ldquo;There had better not be a police blunder, or the town will go up / The city&rsquo;s a time-bomb / From the police chief to the guy on the street &mdash; they&rsquo;re all hated.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Or this from Don&rsquo;t Try To Understand, by Fonky Family: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The state is screwing us / Well you know, we are going to defend ourselves / Don&rsquo;t try to understand.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Or this &mdash; uncannily accurate &mdash; from Alpha 5.20: &ldquo;Clichy-sous-Bois, it&rsquo;s gangsta gangsta / And Aulnay-sous-Bois, it&rsquo;s gangsta gangsta.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Ghetto culture </p>
<p>The violence began on 27 October after the accidental deaths of two teenagers &mdash; in Clichy-sous-Bois. </p>
<p>Rap and hip-hop have been part of France&rsquo;s immigrant youth scene for so long that many of the original artists &mdash; like Joey Starr, MC Solaar and the group IAM &mdash; are now regarded as respected old-timers. </p>
<p>The new stars are men and women in their 20s &mdash; almost all of black African or Arab origin &mdash; such as Disiz La Peste, Diam&rsquo;s, Monsieur R, and the groups La Rumeur and Sniper. </p>
<p>Like the pioneers who featured 10 years ago in the hit film La Haine, their work continues to cast a revealing light on life in the cit√©s and the conditions which helped provoked the sudden outpouring of violence three weeks ago. </p>
<p>Song after song dwells on the same themes of hopelessness, rejection by France, police harassment and the rage that follows. </p>
<p>Disiz La Peste, a 27-year-old of mixed Senegalese and French parentage whose real name is Serigne M&rsquo;Baye, has just released his third album, entitled The Extraordinary Stories Of A Youth In The Banlieue. </p>
<p>The chorus of the title song goes: &ldquo;For France it matters nothing what I do / In its mind I will always be / Just a youth from the banlieue&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Few people in France have a normal attitude towards us. People are either fascinated or they are frightened. There are two worlds crashing against each other. People have a problem with us, and we do with them,&rdquo; he said in a recent interview. </p>
<p>Shock factor </p>
<p>It is undeniable that some of the lyrics of French rap songs &mdash; as in America &mdash; are shocking to the conservative-minded. </p>
<p>In Brigitte &mdash; Cop&rsquo;s Wife, Ministere A.M.E.R indulges in a pornographic fantasy which will not be to most tastes. </p>
<p>Other groups including Sniper and La Rumeur have been taken to court &mdash; unsuccessfully &mdash; for provocative lyrics. </p>
<p>And the rapper Monsieur R &mdash; whose real name is Richard Makela &mdash; was criticised for a recent song called FranSSe, in which he described France as a &ldquo;chick &hellip; treat her like a whore!&rdquo; </p>
<p>But most French rap songs show a deep urge to articulate what would otherwise go unexpressed in words, and &mdash; whatever your feelings about the genre &mdash; many do so with invention. </p>
<p>The French language, with its repeated end of word inflections, is widely recognised as lending itself to rap, and even masters of the form in the US have been complimentary. </p>
<p>Today many French rappers are saying that if only their words had been listened to, the suburban violence might never have occurred. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of sleeping in the national assembly, government ministers should have listened to our albums. It&rsquo;s the youth of France talking,&rdquo; said Rim-K of 113. </p>
<p>Plea for calm </p>
<p>Some, such as Disiz La Peste, have called openly for an end to the rioting. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Burning cars and schools &mdash; it only harms ourselves because it&rsquo;s happening in front of our own homes,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;And we risk turning the working people, the poor of our neighbourhoods against us &mdash; because not unnaturally they are going to be afraid,&rdquo; La Peste said. </p>
<p>Maybe because of his mixed background, he takes an unusually balanced view of the trouble and of how to end it. </p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all France must learn to say sorry &mdash; for history, for the colonies, because there is no equality of opportunity, because we can&rsquo;t get into nightclubs, because there are none of us on television or in the national assembly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But the youth must also learn to say thank you. It may be shocking for them &mdash; but in France at least people can still demonstrate and speak out,&rdquo; said La Peste.</p>
