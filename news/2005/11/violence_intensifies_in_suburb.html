<h1><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=1277237">Violence Intensifies in Suburbs of Paris</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamey Keaten, AP, Nov. 3</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rioting youths shot at police and firefighters Thursday after burning car dealerships and public buses and hurling rocks at commuter trains. France&rsquo;s government faced growing pressure to curb the violence, fueled by anger over poor conditions in suburban Paris housing projects. </p>
<p>Rampaging for an eighth day, youths ignored an appeal for calm from French President Jacques Chirac, whose government worked feverishly to fend off a political crisis amid criticism that it has ignored problems in suburbs heavily populated by first- and second-generation North African and Muslim immigrants. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The riots started last Thursday after the electrocution deaths of two teenagers hiding in a power station from police they believed were chasing them in the northeastern suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois. </p>
<p>By Wednesday night, violence had spread to at least 20 Paris-region towns, said Jean-Francois Cordet, the top government official for the Seine-Saint-Denis region north of Paris where the violence has been concentrated. He said youths in the region fired four shots at riot police and firefighters but caused no injuries. </p>
<p>Nine people were injured in Seine-Saint-Denis and 315 cars burned across the Paris area, officials said. In the tough northeastern suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, youth gangs set fire to a Renault car dealership and burned at least a dozen cars, a supermarket and a local gymnasium. </p>
<p>Traffic was halted Thursday morning on a suburban commuter line linking Paris to Charles de Gaulle airport after stone-throwing rioters attacked two trains overnight at the Le Blanc-Mesnil station. They forced a conductor from one train and broke windows, the SNCF rail authority said. A passenger was lightly injured by broken glass. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The violence also cast doubt on the success of France&rsquo;s model of seeking to integrate its large immigrant community &mdash; its Muslim population, at an estimated 5 million, is Western Europe&rsquo;s largest &mdash; by playing down differences between ethnic groups. Rather than feeling embraced as full and equal citizens, immigrants and their French-born children complain of police harassment and of being refused jobs, housing and opportunities. </p>
