<h1>The New White Flight</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suein Hwang, Wall Street Journal (New York City), Nov. 19</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CUPERTINO, Calif. &mdash; By most measures, Monta Vista High here and Lynbrook High, in nearby San Jose, are among the nation&rsquo;s top public high schools. Both boast stellar test scores, an array of advanced-placement classes and a track record of sending graduates from the affluent suburbs of Silicon Valley to prestigious colleges.</p>
<p>But locally, they&rsquo;re also known for something else: white flight. Over the past 10 years, the proportion of white students at Lynbrook has fallen by nearly half, to 25% of the student body. At Monta Vista, white students make up less than one-third of the population, down from 45% &mdash; this in a town that&rsquo;s half white. Some white Cupertino parents are instead sending their children to private schools or moving them to other, whiter public schools. More commonly, young white families in Silicon Valley say they are avoiding Cupertino altogether.</p>
<p>Whites aren&rsquo;t quitting the schools because the schools are failing academically. Quite the contrary: Many white parents say they&rsquo;re leaving because the schools are too academically driven and too narrowly invested in subjects such as math and science at the expense of liberal arts and extracurriculars like sports and other personal interests.</p>
<p>The two schools, put another way that parents rarely articulate so bluntly, are too Asian.</p>
<p>Cathy Gatley, co-president of Monta Vista High School&rsquo;s parent-teacher association, recently dissuaded a family with a young child from moving to Cupertino because there are so few young white kids left in the public schools. &ldquo;This may not sound good,&rdquo; she confides, &ldquo;but their child may be the only Caucasian kid in the class.&rdquo; All of Ms. Gatley&rsquo;s four children have attended or are currently attending Monta Vista. One son, Andrew, 17 years old, took the high-school exit exam last summer and left the school to avoid the academic pressure. He is currently working in a pet-supply store. Ms. Gatley, who is white, says she probably wouldn&rsquo;t have moved to Cupertino if she had anticipated how much it would change.</p>
