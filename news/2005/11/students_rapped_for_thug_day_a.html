<h1>Students Rapped for Thug Day Attire</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Farwell, Joshua Benton, and Kristen Holland, Dallas Morning News, Oct. 28</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Students at Highland Park High School dressed as gang members, rap stars, maids and yard workers this month during homecoming week &mdash; a tradition one Dallas civil-rights leader says is racially insensitive. </p>
<p>On senior Thug Day, students wore Afro wigs, fake gold teeth and baggy jeans. On Fiesta Day, which was to honor Hispanic heritage, one student brought a leaf blower to school. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The scary part of something like this is you have to wonder how long these kids will continue to think this way,&rdquo; said Bob Lydia, president of the Dallas chapter of the NAACP. </p>
<p>&ldquo;These kids will be leaders of this country one day.&rdquo; </p>
<p>No students were punished, according to Highland Park High principal Patrick Cates. Fewer than a dozen students were asked to remove some of the clothing &mdash; bandannas and gold necklaces. The student with the leaf blower was asked to put the tool in his car. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Senior Katie Braden, who said she wore a LeBron James jersey that day, said she had heard that other high schools have a &ldquo;Highland Park Day,&rdquo; when students dress up to make fun of Highland Park students. She considers it all in good fun. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we called it &lsquo;South Dallas Day&rsquo; or anything,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>Lauren Perella said she wore a &ldquo;wife-beater&rdquo; tanktop and tennis shoes with only one sock. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just having fun,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>Katie said the theme days had been a subject of conversation among students recently, and that she&rsquo;d heard that some teachers were offended. She said the student who showed up with a leaf blower crossed a line. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was funny, but that&rsquo;s probably offensive,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>Elizabeth Carlock, the senior class president, said there&rsquo;s nothing racist about Thug Day. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a &lsquo;Country Club Day&rsquo; last year, and I don&rsquo;t see any difference between dressing up in country-club style and dressing up thug,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t being racist. It&rsquo;s Highland Park tradition.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reality is that they&rsquo;re ignorant of the lives of nonwhites &mdash; it&rsquo;s like a parallel universe,&rdquo; said Charles Gallagher, a sociology professor at Georgia State University who studies white perceptions of race. He has tracked the recent rise of racially themed events, such as so-called &ldquo;ghetto parties,&rdquo; on university campuses. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a community of adolescents who live in a complete white bubble,&rdquo; Dr. Gallagher said. Many Park Cities residents refer to their community as &ldquo;The Bubble.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;If they have interactions with blacks or Hispanics, it&rsquo;s typically someone serving them a soft drink or the Mexican who cuts their lawn.&rdquo; Highland Park High&rsquo;s student body is about 94 percent white. The school has six black, 65 Hispanic and 32 Asian students. </p>
