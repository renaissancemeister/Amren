<h1>Man Charged in Bucks Killing</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Knipe, Philadelphia Daily News, Apr. 26</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But behind his easygoing, neighborly veneer, Stanford Augusto Douglas Jr. had been boiling over what he perceived as a racially insensitive joke a man told him seven years ago.</p>
<p>He apparently spent years tracking the man down &mdash; even hiring a private investigator to help him, authorities said. Until this past Easter Sunday, when, police said, he finally knocked on the man&rsquo;s door, pulled out a gun and opened fire.</p>
<p>William Berkeyheiser, 62, who barely knew Douglas and who perhaps didn&rsquo;t even recognize him, died on his front doorstep. He had been shot multiple times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How someone could do something like that, I&rsquo;ll never understand,&rdquo; Berkeyheiser&rsquo;s wife of 26 years, Viola, said yesterday, following Douglas&rsquo; arraignment on first-degree murder charges.</p>
<p>Viola Berkeyheiser, who is part Okinawan, said her white husband would have never told a racially offensive joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a kind man,&rdquo; Berkeyheiser said. &ldquo;He was not a racist. He just wouldn&rsquo;t have said anything like that. He must have been misunderstood, or [it was] taken something the wrong way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bucks County District Attorney Diane Gibbons, in announcing the arrest yesterday, said Douglas had confessed to killing Berkeyheiser, saying he had been offended by the long-ago joke. He refused to tell police what the joke was.</p>
<p>She called the motive the most &ldquo;baseless&rdquo; reason for a murder that she had seen in her 22 years in law enforcement.</p>
<p>Douglas worked as a custodian, and Berkeyheiser was director of plant operations, for the Baptist Home in Philadelphia in 1998. The two did not work together, and Berkeyheiser was not Douglas&rsquo; supervisor, Gibbons said.</p>
<p>But Douglas never forgot Berkeyheiser, and carried his anger about the joke with him for years, telling police that he often thought about killing Berkeyheiser, according to the police affidavit.</p>
<p>This past March, he apparently hired a private detective firm, A-Plus Investigations, of Levittown, to help him track down Berkeyheiser&rsquo;s address.</p>
