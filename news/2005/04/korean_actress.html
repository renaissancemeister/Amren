<h1><a href="http://www.badeagle.com/journal/archives/2005_04.html">Korean Actress Exposed</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Yeagley, Bad Eagle, Apr. 26</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It wasn&rsquo;t her body that was exposed, but her race, or, shall we say, her &lsquo;real&rsquo; race. Korean actress and producer Lee Yu Jin is down and out in South Korea. Why? The word is out: she&rsquo;s half American. She&rsquo;s a mixed race. Her white father was an American GI. She&rsquo;s 5&rsquo;9&rdquo;, and was always suspect because of her height. </p>
<p>&ldquo;People ask why didn&rsquo;t I come out earlier and why this is such a big deal, &ldquo; the 27-year-old said. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere else, but Korea is still a closed society where people like to talk about the purity of the race.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lee Yu Jin isn&rsquo;t alone in her plight, either. There&rsquo;s the popular singer &ldquo;Sonya,&rdquo; television host Jennifer Yung Wisner, and basketball coach Kim Dong Dwang. Bi-racial persons are considered a downer, in a place like South Korea (to say nothing of Nort Korea). </p>
<p>Janet Mintzer, president of Pearl S. Buck International, says, &ldquo;My impression is that there is more discrimination against Amerasians in South Korea than anywhere else in Asia and that it has not improved significantly.&rdquo; PSBI, a Pennsylvania-based foundation, is credited with coining the term &ldquo;Amerasian,&rdquo; and works with the biracial children in not only South Korea, but also the Philippines and Vietnam, among other Asian countries in which the U.S. military has had a presence. </p>
<p>So it seems that American &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; is actually a code word for intermarriage, multiculturalism, and the dissolution of any distinctions. Never mind the GIs and the predicaments they&rsquo;ve caused, Mintzer&rsquo;s group certainly represents the Communist use of the term, &ldquo;democracy,&rdquo; which Communism is very astute and aggressive to use. (Remember it was the great Students for a Democratic Society, SDS, which spawned the infamous anti-America terrorist group, the Weathermen, in the late &lsquo;60&rsquo;s.) </p>
<p>In other words, if South Korea claims to be a democracy, it should promote inter-racial marriage, multiculturalism, and &ldquo;equality&rdquo; of all things human. There must be no distinctions, save for the wealthy tyrants who run the Communist regime. For Communism, &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; is the open door to dictatorship. </p>
<p>But never mind about that a minute. Lee Yu Jin has an important role in the recent Korean horror film, &ldquo;Bunshinsaba&rdquo; (Ouiji Board), directed by Byeong-ki Ahn (March, 2005). In a scathing review, Yu Jin comes out as &ldquo;the saving grace&rdquo; in the otherwise run-of-the-mill grade &ldquo;c&rdquo; Asian horror film. &ldquo;Her big expressive eyes and soulful looks&rdquo; are not something we normally expect from the Oriental face, right? So her bi-racial &lsquo;condition&rsquo; is what makes her a hit? </p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s ask the question: is love of race, love of culture, love of country, all to be considered immoral now? Has the Communist ideology taken over the whole world? Is any thought of race to be hopelessly consigned to the Nazis? Is Communism then anti-everything that a human being is? Is there to be no escape from the accusation of being a Nazi? </p>
<p>I say, love of race, ethnicity, culture, minus the maniacal, satanic vision of Adolf Hitler, is the only saving grace of the world. Without it, in some multiculturalist, globalist world without boundaries, the world will simply become an emasculated, mass wimp, under the control of a few mega-wealthy tyrants. </p>
<p>There is a reason for differences. This is to keep the human race separated into smaller groups. </p>
<p>Love of race is the only &lsquo;saving grace&rsquo; left in the world, and the Communist, multinationalists, and globalists are desperate to rub out all natural differences. They are anti-race, anti-language, anti-culture, and anti-God, Who in fact created these differences, according to the old Hebrew version of the world (Gen. 11). The Leftists anti-Semitic Jews of the world can say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come a long way, baby!&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s a long way in the wrong direction, seems to me. Man always wants to separate that which God has brought together, as in marriage/divorce, and to bring together that which God has separated, as in language, culture, and race.</p>
<p>Mixed raced people can&rsquo;t help what they are. Their&rsquo;s is no fault. But there is no need to repeat the same, or to advocate more, or to idolize such a condition by perpetuating it. When you realize you&rsquo;re on a wrong path, even if you didn&rsquo;t put yourself on it, the only dignified thing to do is to get back on the right path.</p>
<p>The need in the world today is love of one&rsquo;s own people, without hatred for another&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Love thy neighbor as thyself&rdquo; is both prescriptive and proscriptive. You can&rsquo;t love your neighbor unless you love yourself.</p>
