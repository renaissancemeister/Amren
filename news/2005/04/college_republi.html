<h1><a href="/news/muchronicle/index-ssf_/base/news-4/111288515873250.xml">College Republicans Apologize for Bake Sale</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Ackerman-Haywood, Muskegon Chronicle (Mich.), Apr. 7</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kyle Rausch started the day Monday as president of the Grand Valley State University College Republicans. </p>
<p>By day&rsquo;s end, he had denounced the Republican party and was considering law school as an alternative to public office. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My political career is pretty much shot,&rdquo; said the 19-year-old political science major who spearheaded last month&rsquo;s controversial bake sale, sponsored by the College Republicans. </p>
<p>At the club&rsquo;s meeting Monday, Rausch, club vice president Paul Leitelt, and treasurer Matt Blondke were asked by fellow members to resign. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There was outside advice, but the group made the decision on its own,&rdquo; said Mike Westcott, past president and founder of the Grand Valley chapter of the College Republicans. </p>
<p>Westcott, 23, of Grand Haven, said the group wants to &ldquo;apologize for offending and move on.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The March 21 bake sale upset several students, including five who filed complaints with the university, alleging the group violated GVSU&rsquo;s anti-discrimination policy. </p>
<p>During the sale, the students offered cupcakes for $2 for white men, 75 cents for blacks and white women, 50 cents for Asians and Hispanics, and 5 cents for American Indians. </p>
<p>Prompted by the complaints, administrators set up a review panel to conduct a hearing this Friday. </p>
<p>Paul Leidig, the club&rsquo;s faculty adviser, said &ldquo;the club supported the idea of the bake sale as a satirical form of expression against affirmative action.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But Leidig, who also is chairman of the Ottawa County Republican Party, said he did not know the students planned to use a racially biased price scale when he approved the event. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Had I known that, I would have not approved it,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>As a result of the controversy, Leidig said he advised the students to consider a leadership change to acknowledge they respect the fact people were offended by the bake sale. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not feel they violated any section of the student code,&rdquo; Leidig said. </p>
<p>Rausch said he was planning to make a case at Friday&rsquo;s review for why the group had the right to hold the bake sale. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The university recognized the fact that as long as I was in the driver&rsquo;s seat, I was not going to back down,&rdquo; Rausch said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They used the Republican Party to force me out and got the group to apologize for something they never should have apologized for. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been called a bigot and racist,&rdquo; Rausch said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing racist about saying affirmative action should be based on economic means and not race.&rdquo;</p>
