<p><font size="3"><p>The  
              2000 Census counted 281.4 million Americans, a 13.1 percent increase 
              over the 1990 total of 248.7 million. In 1990, non-Hispanic whites 
              were more than 75 percent of the total population, but in just ten 
              years had slipped to 69.1 percent. Blacks, at 12.3 percent were, 
              for the first time, outnumbered by Hispanics at 12.5 percent. Asians 
              (3.5 percent) and a mix of American Indians, native Hawaiians and 
              other non-whites (2.5 percent) accounted for the rest.</font></p>
                       <p>The graph on this page shows how 
              the white percentage of the population has changed as the proportion 
              of non-whites has increased. According to the Census Bureau, if 
              current trends in immigration and birthrates continue, whites will 
              drop to just under 50 percent of the population in 2060. Blacks 
              are projected to increase slightly to 13.3 percent, while Hispanics 
              would account for 26.6 percent and Asians for 9.8 percent. At that 
              point, the total U.S. population is projected to be more than 432 
              million, which would mean another 145 million people &mdash; the equivalent 
              of absorbing the total population of the United States in 1945.</font></p>

            </table>  <p>In fact, if current trends continue, 
              whites will become a minority sometime before 2060. This is because 
              the projections represented in the graph do not take 2000 census 
              data into account. Before the count, Census Bureau demographers 
              expected to find, at most, 275.8 million people, and the racial 
              projections were based on that expectation. The actual count of 
              281.4 million was 5.6 million more than the highest estimate, which 
              means we had the equivalent of two more Chicagos the bureau had 
              not expected to find. These 5.6 million people and their descendants &mdash; overwhelmingly 
              non-white &mdash; will hasten the day when whites become a minority.</font></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Silent Invasion</font></b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The difference between the expected 
              and actual counts is due mainly to illegal immigration. For the 
              2000 census, the bureau tried very hard to count illegals, and appears 
              to have succeeded beyond its expectations. However, since most of 
              them don&rsquo;t want anything to do with the government, many escaped 
              the count anyway, and no one really knows how many there are. In 
              1993, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) thought there 
              were some three million, and the official 2000 figure for illegals 
              doubles that to at least six million. Researchers at Northeastern 
              University in Boston estimate the number at closer to 13 million, 
              and believe it increases by 500,000 to one million every year.</font></p>

            <p>The legal immigrant population is 
              also growing at 700,000 to 900,000 per year. The foreign-born population 
              of the United States now exceeds 27 million, and one out of every 
              10 Americans is foreign-born, a figure not reached since the 1930s. 
              (One quarter of the federal prison population is foreign born, which 
              means foreigners are 2.5 times more likely than natives to end up 
              in a federal jail.) The top graph on page four shows which countries 
              send the most people and how many naturalize. Current levels of 
              immigration are much higher than the historical average, and have 
              doubled in 20 years. Another graph on page four depicts this sharp 
              increase (illegal immigration is not included), and the regions 
              of the world from which immigrants come. In this graph, the decade 
              of the 1990s still has two more years to run but has <i>already 
              </i>racked up an unprecedented 8.5 million legal immigrants. </font></p>
            <p>Because of changes in the law since 
              the Immigration Act of 1965, approximately 90 percent of legal immigrants 
              are non-white. Practically all illegal immigrants are non-white, 
              which explains why 98 percent of the 2,684,892 illegals granted 
              amnesty by the 1986 Immigration and Control Act were from the Third 
              World: Africa, Asia, Latin America or the Caribbean. The number 
              of immigrants increases every decade, and very few are white.</font></p>

            <p>The 32.7 million rise in the population 
              since 1990 is the single largest one-decade increase in the nation&rsquo;s 
              history. The Hispanic population grew by 57.9 percent, Asians by 
              48.3 percent, blacks by 16.2 percent, and whites by just 5.9 percent. 
              The census bureau considers Middle Easterners and North Africans &mdash; Iranians, 
              Iraqis, Syrians, Egyptians &mdash; to be white. More than 1 million have 
              immigrated since 1970, and have produced an estimated 1 million 
              children. These 2 million should be subtracted from the growth of 
              the &quot;white&quot; population. </font></p>
            <p>Of the country&rsquo;s 35 million Hispanics, 
              more than 20 million, or nearly 60 percent, are Mexicans. In 1960, 
              there were fewer than two million Mexicans in the United States. 
              So many Mexicans have moved north in recent years that some of the 
              poorer parts of Mexico are effectively depopulated.</font></p>
            <p>By 2060, the census bureau projects 
              a Hispanic population of 114.8 million &mdash; more than one quarter of 
              the total projected population, and greater than the entire population 
              of the United States in 1920. As we have noted, this figure is based 
              on projections that are already outdated.</font></p>
            <p>The expanding Hispanic population 
              has already helped reduce whites to a minority in California (now 
              46.7 percent white, 6.7 percent black, 10.9 percent Asian, 32.4 
              percent Hispanic), New Mexico (44.7 percent white, 1.9 percent black, 
              1.1 percent Asian, 42.1 percent Hispanic), Hawaii (22.9 percent 
              white, 1.8 percent black, 41.6 percent Asian, 7.2 percent Hispanic), 
              and the District of Columbia (27.8 percent white, 60 percent black, 
              2.7 percent Asian, and 7.9 percent Hispanic). In Texas (52.5 percent 
              white, 11.5 percent black, 2.6 percent Asian, 32 percent Hispanic), 
              whites are forecast to become a minority in 2004.</font></p>

            <p>Immigration is now the determining 
              factor in US population growth. Since 1970, nearly 30 million immigrants &mdash; roughly 
              <i>one-third</i> of all the people who ever came to America &mdash; have 
              settled in the United States. Immigration and births to immigrants 
              have accounted for 70 percent of the increase in US population since 
              then, and the immigrant population is growing six-and-a-half times 
              faster than the native-born population. Without this influx, the 
              current population would be just over 226 million, or approximately 
              what it was in 1980.</font></p>
            <p>&quot;Replacement-level fertility&quot; 
              is the number of children the average woman must have during her 
              lifetime just to replace herself and her spouse. This figure is 
              set at 2.11 rather than 2.0 to include a margin for premature deaths. 
              If there is no emigration or immigration, a population with average 
              lifetime fertility of 2.11 will eventually level off. It can continue 
              to grow, even with replacement-level fertility, if people are disproportionately 
              young. In 1972, the total fertility rate of American women dipped 
              below replacement level for the first time, and the white rate is 
              now well below replacement level (see lower graph,this page). This 
              means long-term population growth is fueled exclusively by immigration.</font></p>
            <p>In 1997, there were approximately 
              3.9 million births in the United States, reflecting a total fertility 
              rate of 2.04. Non-whites, who are younger than whites and have higher 
              fertility rates, were 28 percent of the population but accounted 
              for 40 percent of the births. Hispanics have the highest lifetime 
              fertility of any group, but are still below the figure of 3.326, 
              reached in 1960-1964 as the the baby boom was ending. Because of 
              their high fertility, Hispanic women have given birth to more children 
              than black women every year since 1993.</font></p>

              </div>
            <div class="text-center"></div>
            <p>Low white fertility means white 
              children are an even smaller percentage of the population than whites 
              as a whole, and are projected to shift to minority status at least 
              20 years sooner. Although 69.1 percent of the total population is 
              white, only 60.9 percent of children under 18 are white, and are 
              expected to become a minority in 2037. These projections do not 
              include the unexpectedly large number of non-whites found in the 
              2000 census, so the transition is likely to take place even sooner.</font></p>
            <p>Whites are moving away from areas 
              hardest hit by immigration, especially the big cities. They are 
              now a majority in only 52 of the 100 largest cities, down from 70 
              in 1990. More than two million whites left these cities since 1990, 
              as more than 3.8 million Hispanics moved in. Over half of all whites 
              live in suburbs, but more and more are fleeing to the country, which 
              is still overwhelmingly white. Only 22.6 percent of whites now live 
              in central cities (44.8 percent of immigrants live in cities). That 
              figure is now smaller than the 23.4 percent of whites who live in 
              rural areas (only 5.4 percent of immigrants live in the country). 
              Blacks have residency patterns more like immigrants, with 53 percent 
              in the cities, 33 percent in suburbs, and only 14 percent in the 
              country (see graph on this page).</font></p>

            <p>Our immigration policy is, in a 
              word, insane. Even if every newcomer were white, well-educated, 
              and English-speaking, it would be folly to expect the country to 
              absorb another 150 million people over the next 60 years. The graph 
              on page three ends at 2060, but the Census Bureau happily forecasts 
              yet more millions in the decades to come. We decry our dependence 
              on foreign raw materials, and cannot generate enough electricity 
              for the millions who have swarmed into California, yet we are supposed

            <p>And, of course, the vast majority

              we import millions of people who are illiterate in their own languages. 
              We claim to want to improve the health of Americans, yet we import 
              people sick with diseases like tuberculosis, which we once eradicated, 
              and leprosy, which is exclusively an immigrant disease. We have 
              spent billions trying to fight poverty, yet we let in millions who 
              own nothing more than the clothes they wear. It would be hard to 
              think of a government policy more flagrantly in opposition to the 
              expressed goals of our society than immigration. </font></p>

              basic identity of a once-great nation.</font></p>
            <p>One of the most important roles 
              of government is to avert catastrophes, both near and distant. This 
              is why we have an army, public health, police, and an environmental 
              policy. The current flood of Third-World immigration is a completely 
              unnecessary catastrophe brought on by the very government that is 
              supposed to be working for our interests. It is not just insane; 
              it is criminal.</font></p></font>

  <font size="3"><p>Everybody wails about 2050 or whatever.  We&rsquo;ll probably be a minority within about 15 to 20 years because the rates of illegal immigration and intermarriage keep increasing and the white birth rate keeps decreasing. </p>
<p>But what about 2015 or so?  By then, social security will be paying out more than it is taking in (and it might even be sooner than that).</p>
<p>Something nobody ever talks about is how the huge majority of retired people will be white.  And who will be the huge majority of people &#8220;expected&#8221; to subsidize social security (and all those rotten segregation loving, slaveholder descendant, racist, oppressive, trailor trash, white devils?&hellip;our third world bretheren.</p>
<p>As the years pass, there will be even more people like Maxine Waters and Al Sharptons in positions of power.  Whites will be outnumbered and outvoted by the third world creatures they wanted so desperately to include in this country. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>There is <span class="caps">ONE </span>thing that could alter this trend towards third world chaos and that is an economic collapse, which would be due to either a man-made or natural disaster.<br>
 <br><br>
As is often said, deportation of illegals isn&rsquo;t a viable option, but having most of them return home and encouraging legal ones to emigrate back is a possibility, if economic conditions deteriorate to the point where jobs are scarce and governmental tax bases are shrunk and huge curtailments in social programs are mandated.  <br><br>
 <br><br>
If the resulting economic situation is brief, (less than two years)we very well could see the percentage of whites in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>population rise rather than drop as it has been doing.  If that&rsquo;s the case and immigration is discouraged, we might stand a chance to see the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>survive in its entirety.  But if the depression is long, then it will be civil war two for sure, as each tribal group fights over its share of bread, because nothing could make all the third worlders leave. <br><br>
 <br><br>
What are the possible scenarios that would cause a severe depression?  In my opinion it could be skyrocketing oil costs due to a natural disaster or to conflict in the Middle East or an upsurge in oil consumption by China and India, to name just a few.<br><br>
 <br><br>
Iran has the ability to completely seal the Straits of Hormuz, halting all traffic in and out of the Persian Gulf, if they are attacked by Israel or the <span class="caps">U.S.  </span> They&rsquo;ve purchased Sunburst anti-ship missiles from Russia that travel just above the surface of the water and travel at, I believe, 2.5 mach speed, and are undetectable via radar.  It is my understanding that these units are mobile and would be next to impossible to destroy.  Shutting down traffic in the Persian Gulf would cause a world wide oil shortage which would result in a global economic meltdown.<br><br>
 <br><br>
The possibility of natural disasters has been present throughout history, and some of them have had devastating consequences, whether they were earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, or meteor impacts in some region of the planet.<br><br>
 <br><br>
At present, we have Mt. St Helens perking.  It has been relieved of some stress but nobody can accurately say it won&rsquo;t erupt tomorrow or in the near future with enough intensity to cause ash and gas fall out over hundreds of miles, choking out the crops in America&rsquo;s breadbasket, the San Joaquin Valley in Calif, as well as productive farming areas in other nearby states.<br><br>
 <br><br>
As possible volcanic eruptions go, the same can be said of the Volcano in Yellowstone that has Vulcanologists scampering around right now, wringing their hands with worry, because the expected possibility of destruction, if it erupts,  will not only be to America&rsquo;s farmlands, but to the entire country. National Geographic is giving particular attention to this possibility.<br><br>
 <br><br>
And, we have all heard about the Big One that is expected in California, along the San Andreas fault line most likely, but possibly along another.  Seismologists have <span class="caps">ALWAYS </span>said it&rsquo;s not a question of whether we might have a devastating earthquake there, but it is just a question of when it&rsquo;s going to occur.  Just a vertical shift downward in the earth&rsquo;s surface would put the westward section of California under water, which is a very likely scenario that has received a lot of ridicule by people who laughingly say there are people who believe California will fall off into the ocean.  Fall off isn&rsquo;t a possibility.   But sink?  A very real one.  A resulting tsumani would probably extend as far east as Arizona and Nevada also, and would certainly submerge Death Valley.  We can all imagine what kind of economic chaos would result if the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>lost most of California.<br><br>
 <br><br>
Increased oil consumption by China and India is something that seems to be accelerating right now, but, quite frankly,  I haven&rsquo;t been able to find anyone who is giving an analysis as to just why this seems to be occurring all at once, so I&rsquo;m still mystified as to why it has suddenly become a factor, especially since oil was projected to be in the $28 range for the foreseeable future about a year ago by <span class="caps">OPEC </span>themselves.  It sold today for $53 per bbl, and it is said that the consumption of India and China have increased and are responsible for the price hike, because suppliers are at full capacity, but demand is now greater.  But one thing for certain is that increased oil prices definitely have the ability to cause severe economic problems.<br><br>
 <br><br>
If any of the above scenarios came about when America was a homogeneous nation as it once was before World War <span class="caps">II,</span> I think  the country would survive and would very likely become even more united.  But in its present tribal form, the least little problem we&rsquo;re confronted with could spell doom. Our demographs have changed dramatically, as this article indicates, and every day we are living on the brink.<br><br>
 <br><br>
In my opinion, if the economy stays sound with no man made or natural disasters for the next several years, and drastic immigration reform isn&rsquo;t enacted, I believe we will still see large-scale civil strife, but it will take longer to arrive, and we will be confronted with even more violence and hate against whites, and Amren&rsquo;s 2010 edition will show us reduced to about 60% of the population. <br><br>
 <br><br>
It&rsquo;s a sad state of affairs we&rsquo;re in that makes it necessary to have a major disaster to get our country back.<br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>One negative factor on fertility in the Western nations can be attributed to the modern corporate culture&rsquo;s ever increasing demands on it&rsquo;s employees.  In addition, women in the professional workplace have very few, or no children.</p>
<p>I currently work, and have worked for, major corporations whose names you all would recognize.  In my experience, the net fertility rate for people who work in these corporations is around 1.2 per family unit (married or single) not even achieving the replacement value of 2.1.  This is one reason why the third world&rsquo;s demographic warfare against the Western nations is so successful.</p>
<p>How can we so affluent, yet so shortsighted to realize that Western civilization does not exist in the &#8220;ether&#8221;, but in those people who will carry on it&rsquo;s knowledge and culture in the years to come.  However, these people have to be born first to achieve this continuation.</p>
<p>Put it another way, if you were a scientist and observing a &#8220;species&#8221; (the professional employees of modern corporations)that was suffering a 40% to 50% drop in net population with each generation, that was not caused by disease, famine, or conflict, you would conclude that something is very, very, wrong with the culture.  Considering that reproduction is one of the most fundamental, and strongest drives in all living things then indeed that culture has to have some very negative aspects to it.<br>

<p>We only have ourselves to blame.  That is what happened to the ancient Romans and has been predicted for us for probably 40-50 years.  Higher standards of living mean that people don&rsquo;t want smelly little kids around.  The consequences hit a few generations later.

  <font size="3"><p>A very good article given the limitation of its data sources.</p>
<p>  The baby boomers will begin to be eligible for social security in the year 2008 (given 1946 as the start date of the boomers), that is 3 years from now.  More importantly, the boomers will become eligible for medicare in the year 2011, six years from now.  The burden on the federal government created by the medicare budget will dwarf that created by social security.  By 2030, as the country verges on the brink of becoming a majority non-white nation with dramatically decreasing levels of skill and education of its population, the boomers will be creating a great sucking sound as they draw out monies not only from government entitlement programs but also from the stock market via draw downs on their 401&rsquo;s, etc.  This will creat a situation in which federal buget deficits mushroom while capital is sucked out of the economy.</p>
<p>In The Coming Generational Storm, the authors who do not take into account the racial demographics of the next several decades ask the reader to close his eyes and open them again in the year 2030.  What he sees is &#8220;a  country whose collective population is older than that in Florida today&hellip;a country where walkers outnumber strollers..one with twice as many retirees but only 18 % more workers to support them..a country with large numbers of impoverished elderly citizens languishing in understaffed, overcrowed, substandard nursing homes&hellip;a government in desperate trouble.  Its rising taxes sky high, drastically cutting retirement and health benefits, slashing defense, education, and other critical spending, and borrowing far beyond its capacity to repay.  Its also printing tons of money to &#8220;meet&#8221; its bills.  You see major tax evasion, high and rising rates of inflation, a growing underground economy, a rapidly depreciating currency, and more people exiting than entering the country.  They&rsquo;re leaving because they&rsquo;re sure things will get still worse&hellip;You see political instability, unemployemnt, labor strikes, high and rising crime rates, record-high interest rates.  You see financial markets in ruin.  In short, you see America plunging headlong toward third world status.&#8221;</p>
<p>This picture is of the US in 25 years and it does not take into account the changing racial demographics or illegal immigration.  The people who will be leaving the country at that time will probably be overwhelmingly the educated whites, making their minority status more acute.  Anyone who has young children should think very seriously about this senario as your children will likely grow up in a country which is not only third world in its economic structure but in its population demographics as well.  Your children will be the ones attempting to leave the country for a better future.  This is no flight of fancy either.  It is the most likely senario given the current state of our knowledge.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>Will we whites eventually become a new &#8220;protected minority&#8221; when we reach those low numbers?  </p>
<p>Nahhhhhh!  Imagine a Black insisting on affirmative action for a low scoring and under-achieving white who demands admittance to a school, job or institution.  It will never happen.</p>
<p>Actually, all a white would then have to do is be exquisitely sensitive to social slights, mostly imagined, and to act out violently on impulse, all in the name of social injustice.

In the <span class="caps">USA</span> I can only discern American Renaissance, Pat Buchanan, <span class="caps">VDARE </span>and in the extreme-right: Stormfront.com and the national Alliance.

<p>In Europe we have active political parties: FN in France (Le Pen even achieved 2nd place in the presidential elections), Haider in Austria, <span class="caps">LPF </span>in Holland, Vlaams Blok in Belgium and similar parties in Scandinavia, all parties having some 20% of the popular vote and growing.</p>

<p>Jim you&rsquo;re right and the same thing is happening all over Europe.  The Europeans are so busy working to pay taxes they often only feel that they can afford to have one child, maybe none.</p>
<p>At the same time, these Third World parasites have plenty of time and looks like money, to have several children.  European families are being sacrificed so that they can multiply.  We see it everyday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before so forgive me for repeating.<br>
A friend of mine has a 13 year-old niece and she is the <span class="caps">ONLY</span> German girl in her entire 7th grade class.<br><br>
The non-White kids threaten her constantly and tell her that Germany will soon belong to them, because Germans do not have enough babies!<br><br>
How&rsquo;s that for a slap in the face?<br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>To the anonymous poster who wrote: &#8220;AND the overwhelmingly majority of Hispanics [including the obvious Indians] whose race is always listed as White in crime stastistics  &mdash;  when they are the perpetrators.  On Census forms they decide for themselves.  75% percent choose White.</p>
<p>&#8220;The official explanation for this deception is that &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is not a race but an ethnicity. The reality is that the racial lines are being deliberately blurred and the statistics rigged.&#8221;</p>
<p>The criticism you level at the Census is not valid. The Census contains a question about whether respondents are of Hispanic or non-Hispanic ethnicity. Even though a large number of Hispanics do mark their race as white on the Census, they also mark Hispanic as their ethnicity. So the Census does separate out Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites.</p>
<p>Also, it is not true that 75% of Hispanics mark their race as white. More than 40 percent of Hispanics mark their race as &#8220;Other.&#8221; The majority of the remainder mark their race as white.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>To Jim Moore and Kellye:</p>
<p>I would gladly have two or more children if there were any bright spots for white people in America.  Truth is, there aren&rsquo;t.  Whites are nothing more than mindless tax paying animals who precoccupy themselves with material well being over racial survival and racial well being.  It would be madness to entrust the future of our children to spineless, raceless, materialistic, suburban wimps that white men have become and callous, raceless, self absorbed, ultra-materialistic, neo-feminists that most white american women have become.  </p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t forget the massive outsourcing still in progress and forecasted to get much worse in the coming years.  The jobs that provided upward mobility and a stable income conducive to supporting a family are few and far between anymore.  </p>
<p>Whites do not act collectively to advance their own racial interests as every other race seems to do unapologetically. Whites are behind enemy lines in their own countries with governments that cater to every need and whim of non-whites.  I will not bring children into this world to watch them suffer and die in the polyglot pigsty that is now America.   </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I think that Joanathan may well be right.  The US starts out with a massive disadvantage because 13% or so of its &#8220;natives&#8221; are already non-white, i.e. african american.  The europeans do not have to figure this in their calculations.  Also, although many european countries have jumped on the diversity band wagon, the US was really the first to systematically promote a federally sanctioned racial spoils system with the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; legeslation of 1964 followed by the Kennedy &#8220;reform&#8221; of the US immigration system the following year.  Both of these pieces of legislation and their progeny put the US well ahead of europe on the course to a multiethnic, non-white, third world society.  Add the open southern border with millions of non-white, low-skilled hispanics flooding the country each year and you have a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>I lived in europe in the mid 1970&rsquo;s and, at least what I saw in England and Italy was significantly behind the US in terms of non-white immigration.</p>
<p>Remember, europeans have a much stronger sense of national identity than do americans who have successfully been sold the line about a &#8220;nation of immigrants&#8221; hook, line and sinker.</p>
<p>So, I agree that the US is likely to devolve into third world demographics before this happens in europe.  My hope is that the europeans will learn some lessons from the collapse of american society and will institute policies which spare them america&rsquo;s fate.  This is why my suggestion to AR readers is to start looking for your european roots.  This may enable you to obtain dual citizenship in one of the EU countries.  If you have a grandfather or grandmother born in Ireland, for example, you can apply and will receive Irish citizenship.  You just need to gather all the required documents and apply to the nearest Irish Consulate or the Embassy in Washington <span class="caps">DC. </span> This may well not be important for you but it may mean the difference between freedom and slavery for your children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>America is certainly worth fighting for but the forces which are leading to its destruction are so powerful that it is only prudent to make plans for a future which no longer contains the US as a first world nation.  Europe is not and probably will not be a paradise in 10 or 20 years but it may well be the last outpost of a predominantly white european culture in the world.  Perhaps before we are destroyed there will be a fight, a <span class="caps">CWII, </span>out of which something may be preserved.  When I feel most melancholy I go to my basement  &mdash;  stocked with combat rifles, boxes of fine ammunition and the tools to keep the weapons firing.  This is the one ray of sunshine in the overwhelming cloudy sky; americans can still own guns and americans may soon find that such ownership is all that saves them from destruction.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Ethnicity is <span class="caps">NOT </span>race.</p>
<p>So choosing &ldquo;Some other race&rdquo; is meaningless since those who do so must be placed into one of the <span class="caps">OMB </span>racial categories for statistical purposes: &ldquo;The groups shown in the census race question can be collapsed into the minimum race categories needed by the federal government:  White, Black or African American, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, and  Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.</p>
<p>Big Brother speaks:</p>
<p><span class="caps">RACE MODIFICATIONS</span></p>
<p>This summary file provides data from Census 2000 that have been modified to assign each of the persons in the &ldquo;Some other race&rdquo; category to an <span class="caps">OMB </span>race category. The modified race data include 31 race groups which are the single and multiple race combinations of the <span class="caps">OMB </span>race categories: White; Black or African American; American Indian and Alaska Native; Asian; and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. (For a list of the 31 race groups shown in this summary file, see Figure 1 in Chapter 1.)</p>
<p>In Census 2000, there were roughly 18.5 million people who identified  Some other race  as part of, or their only, race response. These people were primarily of Hispanic origin, 90.4 percent or 16.8 million people, and many wrote in their Hispanic origin or Hispanic origin type (such as Mexican or Puerto Rican) as their race. Since these people were not included in one of the five <span class="caps">OMB </span>race categories, it was necessary to modify their race. Responses of &ldquo;Some other race alone&rdquo; were modified by blanking the &ldquo;Some other race&rdquo; response and imputing an <span class="caps">OMB </span>race category, either alone or in combination with another race. Race responses were imputed from a &ldquo;donor,&rdquo; who matched on Hispanic origin. Responses of both &ldquo;Some other race&rdquo; and an <span class="caps">OMB </span>race(s) were modified by blanking the  Some other race  response and using the <span class="caps">OMB </span>race response(s) that was provided. No modification was made for responses indicating only an <span class="caps">OMB </span>race alone or in combination with another race. (A more detailed explanation on the procedures used for race modifications is found in Chapter 3.)</p>
<p>Procedure: Race Modification</p>
<p>1. <span class="caps">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p>The following describes the modifications used to reconcile the Census 2000 race categories with those race categories that appear in the data from administrative records, which are used to produce population estimates and projections.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DEFINITIONS</span></p>
<p>A. A specified race response is a response of one or more of the five Office of Management and Budget (OMB) race categories: White; Black or African American; American Indian and Alaska Native; Asian; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.<br>
B. A non-specified race response is a response of &ldquo;Some other race.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="caps">CATEGORIZATION</span> OF <span class="caps">CENSUS</span> 2000 <span class="caps">RACE RESPONSES</span><br>
A. Single or multiple race responses that include only specified <span class="caps">OMB </span>races.<br><br>
B. Single race responses of a non-specified race (Some other race alone).<br><br>
C. Two or m ore race responses that include both the specified <span class="caps">OMB </span>race(s) and the non-specified response, &ldquo;Some other race.&rdquo;<br><br>
<span class="caps">MODIFICATION PROCEDURES</span><br><br>
A. No modification was made for race responses where only a specified <span class="caps">OMB </span>race was provided alone or in combination with one or more <span class="caps">OMB </span>races (e.g., White alone, White and Black or African American; White and Black or African American and American Indian and Alaska Native).<br><br>
B. Non-specified race responses of &ldquo;Some other race&rdquo; alone were modified by blanking the non-specified race response and allocating a specified <span class="caps">OMB </span>race alone or in combination. Race was allocated from a donor within the household that matched on Hispanic origin. If a donor could not be found within the household, a race was allocated from a hot deck matrix where the donor and donee matched on the specific Hispanic origin (Not Hispanic or Latino; Mexican; Puerto Rican; Cuban; Central American and Dominican; South American; other Spanish).<br><br>
C. Race responses of both specified and non-specified races were modified by blanking the non-specified race and using the specified <span class="caps">OMB </span>race(s). For example, White and Some other race became White alone; White and Black or African American and Some other race became White and Black or African American.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>To Super Dave:</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean that all Whites should run out and start having children regardless of their situation.  Obviously, parenthood is not for everyone.</p>
<p>I agree with you that the future does look very bleak for Whites.<br>
What is so upsetting is that so many Whites are willing to sacrifice their own families in order to get out to work, thereby paying more taxes in order to support hordes of non-Whites spitting out babies on welfare!</p>
<p>What about those &ldquo;generational perpetual welfare recipients&rdquo; (those whose family has been on welfare for generations and who have never had any intentions of working) and non-White asylum seekers should have to agree to sterilization. (I know, that may sound too harsh, but why are the sacrificial lambs only us Whites)<br>
No sterilization, no welfare benefits for subsequent children born while receiving welfare and no asylum.  <br><br>
Anyone can end up on social relief for a period of time.  It happens.  That&rsquo;s what the system is supposed to be there for.  Emergencies.  There is no shame in that.  <br><br>
Loss of employment or an illness are valid reasons for a family to receive help, but <span class="caps">NOT </span>for lazy, oversexed non-Whites who think that it is their God-given right to freeload off us. <br><br>
We <span class="caps">REWARD </span>the parasites by giving them more money with every additional child that they bring into the world.<br><br>
And they take full advantage of this.<br><br>
How often have I heard non-Whites saying things like:  &#8220;Well, my oldest is almost old enough to go to school, I&rsquo;m going to get pregnant again&#8221;. <br><br>
They don&rsquo;t even have to worry about that here in Germany.  The asylum seekers from Africa, Iran, Iraq and everywhere else never have to work.  If they have trouble conceiving, our welfare system <span class="caps">PAYS </span>for them to see a specialist so that they can have more babies for us to support.</p>
<p>There is something very wrong with our system.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Aristotle and Robert Kelly have some interesting points.  Add to those the fact that the US is very close to bankruptcy, on a national scale, and many of us are personally.  I am sure quite a few of you would agree with the statement: &#8220;I was able to keep up with my bills until the last few years, but those credit card balances just keep going up now.&#8221;  The official inflation rate seriously understates inflation, which has got to be close to 10% now.  Wages are stagnant - assuming you have been able to keep a good job.</p>
<p>We have got a big housing bubble, a massive governmental liability for autism (caused by mercury in vaccines), and every layer of finance is leveraged far more than even 10 years ago.</p>
<p>I would be amazed if we can chug along for 10 more years before a depression hits.  Protect yourself: get out of adjustable rate debt.   Sell your house if necessary, especially if it&rsquo;s in a high priced area.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>You are too pessimist friends, without hope the war is lost in start.</p>
<p>I can see around me in the world, a lot of signs that show a change,and then the words &#8221; IF <span class="caps">THE TREND&hellip;.</span>&#8221;, is impossible the trend can continue, all the trend find a resistence, is not a wave without obsatcles.</p>
<p>I can underline some  main obstacles:</p>
<p>*AIDS<br>
*THE <span class="caps">JOBS MIGRATION</span><br><br>
*THE <span class="caps">END</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> 60&rsquo; <span class="caps">IDEOLOGY</span></p>
<p>In all the western countries the white people leave from the big city, to little city or country, this is the first sign for a change in the birth rate.<br>
The migration of the jobs to China or India, is not only a threat, because can&rsquo;t coexist in the long term the migration of the jobs and the immigration of the workers.<br><br>
In Europe the low increase of the economy, the migration jobs and the immigration of the people, is getting ready a perfect explosive mixture for a violent change.<br><br>
The a thig, is sad to say, but <span class="caps">AIDS </span>is working for us, but is another virus I think that will do the difference:</p>
<p>The virus of modernity is entering in the other races just when I think it&rsquo;s going out of our body, I think the white people is entering in a new era, an era where religion is again important, where all the -ism lose their influence, and these things are hidden in the statisticses and graphics .<br>
