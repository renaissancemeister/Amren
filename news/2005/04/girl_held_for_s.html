			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Riot Hlatshwayo, news24.com (SA), Apr. 5</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tzaneen &mdash; Three dogs were put down after villagers allegedly caught a 12-year-old girl having sex with one of the animals. </p>
<p>The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) in Tzaneen confirmed that the three dogs were put down last week Tuesday because they&rsquo;d been beaten so badly by angry villagers. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We had no alternative because they were in a really bad state,&rdquo; said Tzaneen SPCA chairperson, Ranate Prinsloo. </p>
<p>She said police had asked the SPCA to collect the animals from a village in the Bolobedu area after villagers threatened to kill the dogs themselves to protect their daughters. </p>
<p>Mopani police spokesperson Superintendent Moatshe Ngoepe reported that the incident began as a rumour. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Villagers heard that the young girl always had sex with three male dogs, so they lay in wait to catch her in the act,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>They claim to have seen at least one dog and the girl going behind her family&rsquo;s house on Monday afternoon last week and &ldquo;surprised&rdquo; them. </p>
<p>Police were called and arrested the child for bestiality. </p>
<p>She appeared before the Bolobedu magistrate&rsquo;s court last Wednesday and the magistrate ordered that she be sent to a psychologist. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are expecting the psychologist&rsquo;s report soon,&rdquo; Ngoepe said. </p>
<p>Head of the Bethesda Christian Church, Dr Elijah Mtileni, believes demons are to blame and said only prayer and fasting would help the girl. </p>
<p>Afraid of getting Aids </p>
<p>Meanwhile, bestiality charges were provisionally withdrawn against a 19-year-old man from Mphakati near Malamulele last Tuesday. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been accused of having sex with a goat. </p>
<p>Two years ago, another Limpopo man was jailed to 18 years for having sex with a goat in October 2002. He&rsquo;d argued that he abstained from sex with humans because he was afraid of contracting HIV/Aids. </p>
<p>That same year a Bushbuckridge man committed suicide after he was caught having sex with a hen that later died. A young Botswana man who stayed in Limpopo was also accused of having sex with a donkey and littering the ground around it with condoms. </p>
<p>In October 2003, another man was jailed for 10 months after villagers caught him with two goats in Xihosana village near Malamulele.</p>
