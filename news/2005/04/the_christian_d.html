<p><font size="3">                    <p>In the September 1997 issue of AR there 
            was a debate on whether Christianity is at least partly to blame for 
            the demise of Western Civilization and the suicidal course being pursued 
            by Western peoples. Both positions were ably argued, and on the whole 
            I had to agree that the key to the controversy was a distinction between 
            historical Christianity and contemporary Christianity. As Michael 
            W. Masters (&quot;How Christianity Harms the Race&quot;) acknowledged 
            implicitly and Victor Craig (&quot;Defense of the Faith&quot;) acknowledged 
            explicitly, the two are not the same; and, as Mr. Craig argued persuasively, 
            historical Christianity has not been indifferent to the fate of the 
            European peoples.</font></p>

The situation today is quite different. 
            Whether Catholic or Protestant, conservative or liberal, all Western 
            churches have embraced leftist dogmas on questions of nationality 
            and race. The only difference appears to be that the more liberal 
            churches openly support the multicultural and anti-white agenda, while 
            the conservative churches ignore it. Of course, ignoring an agenda 
            that pervades everything from politics to advertising is a form of 
            tacit acceptance. The question is not whether Western churches are 
            betraying their predominantly white congregations; they are. The question 
            is whether they have doctrinal justification to do so.</font></p>
          <p>It would be hard to overestimate the 
            extent to which churches have surrendered to the leftist racial world 
            view. Two years ago, the Pope said this about the inundation of Western 
            countries by Third-World &quot;refugees:&quot; &quot;These foreigners 
            are above all our brothers, and no one should be excepted for reasons 
            of race and religion.&quot; Of course, one could argue that race and 
            religion are the two <i>most important</i> reasons to prevent foreigners 
            from settling in one&rsquo;s homeland. A common race is the foundation of 
            any true nation, while a common religion is the foundation of a common 
            moral code.</font></p>
          <p>Leaving aside the race question for 
            a moment, what kind of insanity has gripped the Catholic hierarchy 
            that it would maintain that a Christian country should not keep out 
            non-Christians? Whatever the answer, Protestant churches in Northern 
            Europe and North America suffer a similar affliction. While liberal 
            Protestants prate about the endless benefits of &quot;diversity,&quot; 
            conservative Protestants boast they will convert the newcomers. So 
            lost have they become in the mists of political correctness, so effeminate 
            has become their Christianity, they do not realize the erection of 
            mosques, Hindu temples, and Buddhist shrines in the formerly Christian 
            lands of the West is not a sign of progress in world evangelism but 
            is terrible regress and defeat.</font></p>
          <p>If the children of these pagan newcomers 
            are, indeed, to be converted from the religions of their parents the 
            contest will be between evangelicals and hedonistic liberals. Is there 
            any doubt that the latter will sweep the field? These children&rsquo;s parents 
            came here to enjoy the good life and escape the challenges of building 
            up their own nations. Their children will inherit this materialistic 
            and self-seeking orientation. Christians can boast all they want about 
            tolerance and love of foreigners, but immigration is only further 
            marginalizing Christianity in our culture.</font></p>
          <p>Some Christian leaders have been so 
            bold as to call on the Western peoples to commit racial suicide so 
            as to make the newcomers feel more welcome. Billy Graham himself recently 
            told white Christians they had a moral duty to foster total racial 
            integration &quot;in our homes, in our worship services, even in our 
            marriages.&quot; Of course, if every young European in the world were 
            to take a non-European wife or husband, the European people would 
            cease to exist in just one generation.</font></p>

          <p>As far as I know, not a single Christian 
            leader condemned, or even criticized, Billy Graham&rsquo;s call for white 
            extinction as a solution to the race problem. Billy Graham&rsquo;s position 
            is similar to that of the former Republican congressman from Southern 
            California, Robert Dornan, who said before a <i>USA Today</i> editorial 
            board meeting: &quot;I want to see America stay a nation of immigrants, 
            and if we lose our Northern European stock &mdash; your coloring and mine, 
            blue eyes and fair hair &mdash; tough! So what if 5,000 years from now we&rsquo;re 
            all going to have a golden tan&hellip; . We&rsquo;re all going to be blended 
            together because of travel, and because of the information highway.&quot; 
            On the race and nationality questions the churches are following the 
            lead of the dominant secular culture, not the other way around.</font></p>
          <p>While few evangelical leaders are as 
            bold as Rev. Graham, many come close. The former director of the Christian 
            Coalition, Ralph Reed, has been particularly eager for the &quot;Christian 
            Right&quot; to support the racial agenda of the Secular Left. At the 
            first Congress of Racial Justice and Reconciliation, held in Washington, 
            DC, in May 1997, Mr. Reed agreed that racial &quot;injustice&quot; 
            was widespread in bank loans, housing, inner-city funding, and in 
            prison sentences. He also agreed there had been a white racist conspiracy 
            to burn black churches. (Readers of AR know that this &quot;conspiracy&quot; 
            was a hoax.) The Christian Coalition launched something called the 
            Samaritan Project, to help rebuild black churches.</font></p>
          <p>Nor should it be forgotten that Mr. 
            Reed and the Christian Coalition are largely responsible for stopping 
            Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s insurgent drive for the Republican presidential nomination 
            in 1996. After winning in New Hampshire, Mr. Buchanan had only to 
            win in conservative South Carolina to establish himself as the front 
            runner ahead of Bob Dole. Mr. Reed and other coalition members simply 
            repeated the leftist media charges that Buchanan was a &quot;racist&quot; 
            and an &quot;extremist,&quot; thus helping Mr. Dole win the primary 
            and nomination. </font></p>
          <p>About the same time, the Christian Coalition 
            helped defeat proposed legislation in Congress that would have cut 
            legal immigration by a modest one-third on the grounds that it would 
            have prevented immigrants from bringing in relatives, thereby thwarting 
            &quot;family reunification.&quot; Such an objection is sentimental 
            nonsense, for it is immigrants who first chose to separate from their 
            families and people. Americans are not obligated to end such freely 
            chosen separations by throwing open their borders. [On this incident, 
            see the remarks made by the president of the American Immigration 
            Control Foundation, John Vinson, in his pamphlet &quot;Immigration 
            and Nation, a Biblical View&quot; (AICF, 1997), p. 16.]</font></p>
          <p>Most Christians never mention, much 
            less oppose, policies that directly harm whites: racial quotas, affirmative 
            action, anti-discrimination laws, forced busing, extortion-motivated 
            &quot;civil rights&quot; lawsuits, black-on-white hate crimes, interracial 
            marriage, and Third-World immigration. They believe Martin Luther 
            King, Jr. was an American Christian hero who truly deserves to be 
            the only American with a national holiday in his honor. They believe 
            &quot;racism&quot; is a sin, but a sin only when it is white racial 
            consciousness or loyalty, never non-white racial consciousness or 
            identity. They believe whites have a moral and Christian obligation 
            to &quot;bridge the racial divide,&quot; integrate their churches, 
            reach out to people of color, etc. It therefore seems a bad joke to 
            speak of Christian conservatives or the Christian Right, for there 
            is nothing conservative about acquiescing in a demographic revolution 
            to turn whites into a minority.</font></p>
          <p>White Christians became racial liberals 
            mainly because the Church has been besieged by the same forces that 
            now dominate every other Western institution. The universalistic and 
            egalitarian ideas of the Enlightenment have now fully penetrated Western 
            culture. Feminist and socialist values have worked their way into 
            Western culture and have overthrown traditional ideals of manhood, 
            patriarchy, and chivalry. Biblical illiteracy, illogic, and historical 
            ignorance have created an environment in which the Scriptures have 
            been perverted into a religious justification for racial liberalism.</font></p>

          <p>There are many examples of such perversion. 
            Christian ministers and writers love to cite the Apostle Paul, who 
            wrote that &quot;there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for 
            the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him&quot; (Romans 
            10:12, New American Standard Bible; all quotations are from this translation, 
            which is known for its accuracy.) They argue this means we should 
            make no racial or ethnic distinctions or even think in racial terms. 
            Paul is said to be conveying the same idea in another epistle: &quot;There 
            is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there 
            is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus&quot; 
            (Galatians 3:28). In context it is clear these two passages reveal 
            God&rsquo;s offer of salvation to all regardless of race, nationality, social 
            standing, or sex. They do not mean &mdash; and as we will see Paul himself 
            makes it clear <i>he </i>does not mean &mdash; that such distinctions should 
            be ignored, that they are unimportant, that acting upon them is sinful, 
            or that they should be overthrown.</font></p>
          <p>If the liberal interpretation of these 
            passages were correct, God would be not only a racial liberal but 
            a socialist and a feminist as well. If these passages endorse the 
            abolition of racial identity and distinctions based on them, they 
            also endorse the obliteration of sex distinctions. And if the Bible 
            supports racial liberalism, why has this fact come to light only in 
            the past century, a century known for its secularism and declining 
            moral and cultural standards?</font></p>
          <p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p> <b>The Old Testament</b></font></p>
          <p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Contrary to what one has heard from 
            the pulpit or on Christian radio, the Bible supports racial preservation 
            and even separation. The Bible teaches that mankind is composed not 
            of an amorphous mass of individuals but of nations. It also teaches 
            that the basis of all genuine nations is a common ethnic stock, which 
            is more important even than a common language, culture, political 
            allegiance, or locale. The Bible praises homogeneity as a blessing, 
            and posits it as the basis of love, friendship, social peace, and 
            national harmony. The Bible also sanctions love of nation and fatherland, 
            a virtue antagonistic to indiscriminate and large-scale immigration.</font></p>
          <p>According to the famous &quot;Table 
            of Nations&quot; in Genesis 10, God organized mankind into discrete 
            nations in the aftermath of the Great Flood. He created three sets 
            of nations, each set descending from one of the three sons of Noah: 
            Fourteen nations from Japheth; 30 from Ham; and 26 from Shem. After 
            listing the progenitors of each of the nations that sprang from Shem, 
            Genesis uses a formula closely repeated for Ham and Japheth, &quot;These 
            are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their 
            languages, by their lands, according to their nations&quot; (Gen. 
            10:31). The Genesis account of the dispersal of the nations concludes, 
            &quot;These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their 
            genealogies, by their nations; and out of these the nations were separated 
            on the earth after the flood&quot; (Gen. 10:32). These passages make 
            clear that the essential constituent element of each nation is common 
            ancestry, together with a &quot;land&quot; and a distinctive language. 
            This is God&rsquo;s creation, with no indication that it is anything other 
            than entirely in accord with His will.</font></p>
          <p>Genesis describes the areas in which 
            these different nations settled in terms of migration patterns that 
            conform to a broad division of races. For centuries there was universal 
            agreement in Christendom that the Europeans were descended from Japheth, 
            the Semites (Jews, Persians, Syrians, Arabs, and Asians) from Shem, 
            and the Africans (including Egyptians and Canaanites) from Ham. However 
            literally or figuratively one chooses to interpret this account, Genesis 
            clearly divides the peoples of the earth into groups of related but 
            racially distinct peoples.</font></p>
          <p>Modern Biblical commentators and Christian 
            leaders have tried to deny the obvious by insisting that the division 
            of nations is not providential but accidental. They believe God intended 
            the nations to be all as one (i.e. to cease being distinct nations). 
            Therefore, they urge Christians to do all they can to restore mankind&rsquo;s 
            lost unity by tearing down national boundaries, promoting mass immigration, 
            teaching English as a universal language, and intermarrying freely 
            with members of other racial families.</font></p>
          <p>This interpretation suffers from several 
            flaws. First, if God intended mankind to be as one, why did He create 
            many nations in the first place? Second, it is contradicted by the 
            order of the Genesis narrative. The Table of Nations comes before 
            the story of the Tower of Babel, indicating that God&rsquo;s ordering and 
            separating of the nations was part of His plan from the beginning. 
            The sons of Noah refused to follow God&rsquo;s clear mandate to separate 
            and fill the earth. Instead, they gathered together, founded a city, 
            and built a huge tower as a symbol of their power and independence. 
            However, God&rsquo;s sovereign purpose cannot be frustrated by the designs 
            of men: &quot;The Lord confused the language of all the earth; and 
            from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the 
            earth&quot; (Gen. 11:9).</font></p>
          <p>The scattering was neither arbitrary 
            nor chaotic. According to the Biblical account, people moved with 
            their nations in an orderly exodus that fulfilled God&rsquo;s purpose. As 
            we learn in Deuteronomy, God gave each nation or people its own lands 
            and separated these lands by territorial boundaries: &quot;When the 
            Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when He separated the 
            sons of man, He set the boundaries of the people&quot; (Deuteronomy 
            32:8).</font></p>
          <p>The third flaw of the modernist interpretation 
            of Genesis 10 and 11 &mdash; and from a Christian perspective the most dangerous &mdash; is 
            that it repeats the sin of the people who built the Tower of Babel. 
            The modern desire for global unity, amalgamation of peoples, destruction 
            of territorial boundaries, English as a universal language, and construction 
            of a world government is difficult to see as anything other than a 
            sinful desire to rebuild the Tower of Babel and create an autonomous 
            humanistic order independent of God. It is a rebellious project that 
            defies God&rsquo;s plan for world order based on discrete nations each residing 
            within its own lands.</font></p>
          <p>Fourth, the project for global unity 
            sullies the beauty and diversity of God&rsquo;s human creation, in that 
            it suggests that the existence of different races, which vary markedly 
            in physical appearance, is a mistake that man is to remedy by racial 
            intermarriage. In this warped version of creation, God is the bungler 
            and man the redeemer.</font></p>

          <p>Throughout the Old Testament, Biblical 
            writers consistently refer to mankind as composed of distinct peoples 
            and nations, and not as an undifferentiated mass of individuals. In 
            fact, Hebrew has no equivalent for the English word &quot;people,&quot; 
            meaning mankind in general. The psalmist is therefore talking about 
            separate peoples when he declares that all the non-Jewish nations 
            are in rebellion against God, and asks &quot;why are the nations in 
            an uproar and the peoples devising a vain thing?&quot; (Psalm 2:1 
            NASB). When the psalmist speaks of the day when all mankind shall 
            acknowledge the one true God, he shouts &quot;Praise the Lord, all 
            nations; laud Him all peoples&quot; (Psalm 117:1). Likewise, &quot;All 
            the nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You, 
            O Lord&quot; (Psalm 86:9). Although the nations join in praising God, 
            they by no means lose their national identities.</font></p>

          <p> </p>
          <p><b>The New Testament</b></font></p>
          <p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>The New Testament reaffirms the national 
            and ethnic distinctions of the Old Testament, if anything, in stronger 
            and clearer terms. Unlike Hebrew, the Greek in which the New Testament 
            was written does have a word for mankind, <i>anthropon</i>; however, 
            it is used infrequently and never suggests the elimination of the 
            national or racial divisions of mankind. Luke wrote that God &quot;made 
            from one [Adam] every nation [<i>ethnos</i>] of mankind [<i>anthropon</i>] 
            to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed 
            times, and the boundaries of their habitation&quot; (Acts 17:26). 
            Christ himself commanded his disciples to go and &quot;make disciples 
            of all the nations [<i>ethna</i>]&quot; (Matthew 28:19).</font></p>
          <p>Paul &mdash; though often cited in Christian 
            attacks on race and nationality &mdash; both in his writings and personal 
            loyalties clearly supports the view that nationality is based on a 
            common ethnic origin. To begin with, one can well ask to what nation 
            did Paul belong, and on what basis? He was born a Roman citizen in 
            the province of Cilicia in Asia Minor. He spoke both Hebrew and Greek 
            fluently. Religiously, he was not only Jewish but a Pharisee. He converted 
            to Christianity. In answer to our questions about his nationality, 
            the modern Christian could offer four possible answers: Paul was a 
            Cilician (place of birth); he was a Roman (citizenship); he was a 
            Greek (language); he was a Jew but became a Christian (religion).</font></p>
          <p>According to Paul himself, all four 
            answers would be wrong, for Paul on numerous occasions, after he became 
            a Christian, identified himself as belonging to the Jewish nation 
            on the basis of birth and heritage &mdash; not merely a Jew but of a particular 
            tribe. He was, he claimed, &quot;of the nation of Israel, of the tribe 
            of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews&quot; (Philippians 3:5). When 
            he wrote to the Romans in the city of Rome, he did not claim to be 
            Roman (except by citizenship) but Jewish: &quot;I too am an Israelite, 
            a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin&quot; (Romans 11:1). 
            He referred to the Israelites as his &quot;brethren, my kinsmen according 
            to the flesh, who are Israelites&quot; (Romans 9:3, 4). He also referred 
            to the Roman Christians as his &quot;brethren&quot; (Romans 11:25), 
            but he is clearly speaking in a spiritual sense.</font></p>
          <p>Thus, Paul made a distinction between 
            his ethnic nation (Israel) and his spiritual nation (the Christians). 
            Far from the latter superseding or abolishing the former, as most 
            modern Christian leaders would claim, Paul affirms and honors both 
            as an integral part of his identity. He hoped that more of his ethnic 
            kinsmen would come to accept Christ as the Son of God: &quot;Brethren 
            [Roman Christians], my heart&rsquo;s desire and my prayer to God for them 
            [Israel] is for their salvation&quot; (Romans 10:1 NKJV). He also 
            expressed confidence that God will not &quot;reject His people,&quot; 
            meaning the Jews (Romans 11:1).</font></p>
          <p>Paul uses the Greek word <i>laos</i> 
            (a people) to refer to both an ethnic people, as in the people of 
            Israel, and a spiritual people, as in the people of God. Paul&rsquo;s use 
            of that word in both contexts proves that ethnicity is not rendered 
            obsolete or illegitimate by coming to Christ.</font></p>
          <p>Paul&rsquo;s ethnic identification is consistent 
            with everything we know about the ancients, whether Greek, Roman, 
            German, Celt, or Semite. They understood a nation to be a people of 
            a common ancestry or race. The Roman Empire was not a nation, nor 
            did any ancient author consider it to be a nation. They understood 
            it to be an empire made up of many nations.</font></p>
          <p>Differences between English and the 
            Greek of the New Testament can cause misunderstanding. Christ&rsquo;s commandment 
            that Christians should &quot;love their enemies&quot; sounds in English 
            like a radical, all-embracing injunction that would do away with ethnic 
            or national differences. Greek, however, distinguishes between personal 
            enemies and foreign enemies. It has three words for enemy: <i>polemios</i> 
            (a foreign enemy), <i>agonistes</i> (a competitor or rival), and <i>echthros</i> 
            (a private enemy; literally, one whom you hate). When Christ commands 
            Christians to &quot;love their enemies&quot; (Matthew 5:44; Luke 6:27,35), 
            he uses the word for one&rsquo;s private enemy, that is to say someone with 
            whom a Christian has quarreled. Never is this injunction applied to 
            foreign enemies, the enemies of one&rsquo;s people.</font></p>

          <p><b>Intermarriage</b></font></p>
          <p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Bible endorses ethnic homogeneity 
            as a positive good that contributes to peace, harmony, and happiness, 
            whether it be in marriage, friendship, or society. The Hebrews were 
            forbidden, first by their patriarchs and later by God Himself, to 
            marry the sons and daughters of the peoples of the land God had promised 
            them. Abraham made his chief servant swear not to search for a wife 
            for his son Isaac &quot;from the daughters of the Canaanites [Hamites], 
            among whom I live; but you will go to my country and to my relatives 
            [descendants of Shem], and take a wife for my son Isaac&quot; (Gen. 
            24:3,4).</font></p>
          <p>When Jacob and his family (sons, daughters, 
            and grandchildren), 70 persons in all, went to Egypt to dwell in the 
            land of Goshen under the protection of Pharaoh, only one son, Simeon, 
            had a Canaanite wife in addition to a Hebrew wife (Genesis 46:8-26). 
            Thus, out of all the grandchildren of Jacob, only one was part Hamitic. 
            Upon their return to the Promised Land some 400 years later, Moses 
            forbade the children of Israel to intermarry with the Canaanites, 
            whose land they were preparing to invade and occupy (Exodus 34:12-16; 
            Deuteronomy 7:3).</font></p>

          <p>Modern theologians, Bible commentators, 
            and pastors are quick to insist that God&rsquo;s prohibition of such marriages 
            was based on religion rather than race or ethnicity. Their shocking 
            conclusion is that while white Christians are forbidden to marry non-Christian 
            whites they are free to marry non-whites so long as they are Christians. 
            They fail to see that God&rsquo;s prohibition was based on both religious 
            and racial considerations. God does not condemn interethnic or interracial 
            marriage per se, but He does lay down a principle that would forbid 
            it as a common or widespread practice. The late Rousas J. Rushdoony 
            points out that Biblical law and example is against all kinds of unequal 
            yoking: &quot;The burden of the law is thus against inter-religious, 
            interracial, and inter-cultural marriages, in that they normally go 
            against the very community which marriage is designed to establish&quot; 
            (The Institutes of Biblical Law, 1973). Many scriptural examples support 
            this interpretation, as we shall see.</font></p>
          <p>Liberal Christians repeatedly point 
            out that God blessed certain interethnic marriages. The examples they 
            cite are always between Israelites and members of other Semitic peoples 
            who were their ethnic kin (descendants of Shem). When Joseph was serving 
            the Pharaoh of Egypt as his chief adviser and servant, he married 
            a member of the ruling class of Egypt and had sons by her, including 
            Manasseh and Ephraim, both of whom would become the patriarchs of 
            two of the twelve tribes of Israel (Genesis 41:8,50-52). However, 
            his wife, as well as the entire ruling class of Egypt of that time, 
            were Hyksos (a Semitic people who were ruling Egypt at the time). 
            They were thus the cousins, or racial kin, of the Hebrews. Undoubtedly, 
            this ethnic and cultural kinship had something to do with the favor 
            with which the Pharaoh and his people viewed the Hebrews during this 
            period.</font></p>
          <p>When Moses fled Egypt some 400 hundred 
            years later, he sought refuge among the Semitic Midianites, a people 
            descended from Abraham and Keturah, and he took a wife from among 
            them. He thus did not violate God&rsquo;s prohibition against intermarrying 
            with the cursed Hamitic peoples. (After Ham showed disrespect to his 
            father Noah, God cursed him and all his descendants &mdash; Gen. 9:20-25.) 
            Nor does the famous marriage between Boaz (an Israelite) and Ruth 
            (a Moabite) violate the principle of ethnic consanguinity, for the 
            Moabites too were Semites, being descendants of Abraham&rsquo;s nephew Lot.</font></p>
          <p>Foreign marriages in the Bible are almost 
            always portrayed as acts of unfaithfulness, disobedience, or lust. 
            God promised Abraham many descendants and to make of them a great 
            nation. Abraham believed the Lord, but his wife Sarah was too old 
            to bear children. She therefore permitted Abraham to have intercourse 
            with their Egyptian maid, Hagar. As God intended miraculously to open 
            Sarah&rsquo;s womb, the result was that Abraham soon had two sons, Ishmael 
            by Hagar (a Hamite) and Isaac by Sarah (a Semite). The result of this 
            mixed lineage was a divided and unhappy household. Eventually, Abraham 
            sent Hagar and Ishmael away. As Hagar chose an Egyptian wife for Ishmael, 
            the Ishmaelites gradually merged into the surrounding Hamitic peoples 
            and soon ceased to exist as a separate people.</font></p>
          <p>Later, Esau (Isaac and Rebekah&rsquo;s eldest 
            son) demonstrated his unfaithfulness to God and his people, as well 
            as his lack of sexual restraint, by marrying two Canaanite women who 
            became a &quot;grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah&quot; (Gen. 26:34, 
            35). The descendants of Esau&rsquo;s marriage (the Edomites) became persistent 
            enemies of the Hebrews.</font></p>
          <p>The great Israelite hero Samson had 
            a weakness for foreign women. Against the wishes of his parents, he 
            took a wife from among the Philistines, and he afterward frequented 
            Philistine harlots. It was this lack of sexual restraint and his unwillingness 
            to abide by God&rsquo;s laws that led to his blindness and death at the 
            hands of his enemies (Judges 16).</font></p>
          <p>Centuries later, when a remnant of the 
            Hebrews returned from their long captivity in Babylon, they repented 
            of their fathers&rsquo; propensity to intermarry with foreigners: &quot;The 
            people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated 
            themselves from the peoples of the lands &hellip;, for they have taken 
            some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, so 
            that the holy race is intermingled with the people of the lands&quot; 
            (Ezra 9:1, 2). This is an unmistakable condemnation of ethnic mixture.</font></p>
          <p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p><b>Prophecy</b></font></p>
          <p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Prophecy in both the Old and the New 
            Testament gives strong evidence that God considers his division of 
            mankind into various national or racial families not as an obstacle 
            to be overcome but as an integral, praiseworthy, and permanent part 
            of His creation. In some passages, prophecy points to the eternal 
            significance of these distinctions. David prophesied that &quot;all 
            the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord, and all 
            the families of the nations will worship before Thee&quot; (Psalm 
            22:27 NASB); and that &quot;all the nations whom Thou hast made shall 
            come and worship before Thee&quot; (Psalm 86:9 NASB). James, the half-brother 
            of Jesus, declared before the Jerusalem Church Council that the Father 
            had revealed through the prophet Amos that He would send his Son (Jesus 
            Christ) &quot;so that the rest of mankind [<i>anthropon</i>] may seek 
            the Lord, even all the nations [<i>ethne</i>] who are called by My 
            name&quot; (Acts 15: 17). Election does not destroy national identity.</font></p>
          <p>The Book of Revelations provides clear 
            evidence for the eternal destiny and indestructibility of the nations. 
            In the New Jerusalem (Heaven), &quot;the nations [<i>ethne</i>] shall 
            walk by its light, &hellip; and they shall bring the glory and honor 
            of the nations [<i>ethnon</i>] into it&quot; (Rev. 21:24, 26). Furthermore, 
            John revealed that the leaves of the Tree of Life in the midst of 
            Paradise &quot;were for the healing of the nations [<i>ethnon</i>]&quot; 
            (Rev. 22:2). These passages are impossible to understand without recourse 
            to a doctrine of Christian ethnic nationalism.</font></p>
          <p>Moreover, it is only recently that the 
            churches of the West have claimed that ethnic and racial nationalism 
            are in conflict with Christianity. The great Protestant reformer John 
            Calvin affirmed the necessity and goodness of the national division 
            of mankind: &quot;Just as there are in a military camp separate lines 
            for each platoon and section, men are placed on the earth so that 
            each nation may be content with its own boundaries.&quot; In this 
            manner, &quot;God, by his providence reduces to order that which is 
            confused&quot; (Quoted in William J. Bouwsma, <i>John Calvin: A Sixteenth 
            Century Portrait</i>; New York: Oxford University Press, 1988, p. 
            35).</font></p>
          <p>Of the major Christian churches, only 
            the Eastern Orthodox Church seems to have retained an understanding 
            of the legitimate and necessary place of the nation in the life of 
            the individual Christian. In a recent document, the bishops of the 
            Russian Orthodox Church affirm both the universality and particularity

          <p>The bishops also challenge the leftist 
            dogma that nationalism is acceptable only when it is based on non-ethnic 
            factors: &quot;Christian patriotism may be expressed at the same time 
            with regard to a nation as an ethnic community and as a community 
            of its citizens. The Orthodox Christian is called to love his fatherland, 
            which has a territorial dimension, and his brothers by blood who live 
            everywhere in the world.&quot; In addition, &quot;the patriotism of 
            the Orthodox Christian should be active. It is manifested when he 
            defends his fatherland against an enemy, works for the good of the 
            motherland, cares for the good order of [a] people&rsquo;s life through, 
            among other things, participation in the affairs of government. The 
            Christian is called to preserve and develop national culture and people&rsquo;s 
            self-awareness&quot; (&quot;Bases of the Social Concept of the Russian 
            Orthodox Church,&quot; Jubilee Bishops&rsquo; Council of the Russian Orthodox 
            Church, 13-16 August 2000, pp. 4-7).</font></p>
          <p>One cannot imagine the Catholic, Lutheran, 
            Anglican, Methodist, Baptist, or Presbyterian churches issuing a document 
            of such wisdom. It is no coincidence that the one prominent Christian 
            writer who understands that nationalism and Christianity are not in 
            conflict is an Eastern Orthodox Christian, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. 
            Upon returning to his homeland in 1993, the Russian patriot explained 
            why he had left a comfortable existence in the United States: &quot;In 
            Vermont I had wonderful conditions, better than anything Tolstoy ever 
            had&hellip; . I could have stayed there peacefully and in great happiness. 
            But it would have been running away from my duty not to have come 
            back. I could not escape our people&rsquo;s pain.&quot; His words stand 
            as a rebuke to all Third-World Christians living in America who refuse 
            to return to their homelands to build their own nations and help evangelize 
            their own people.</font></p>
          <p>For centuries Christians have had no 
            difficulty accepting the important teaching of Scripture about the 
            legitimacy of nations. That they now ignore this teaching or misinterpret 
            it points to the poisonous infiltration of Enlightenment and socialist 
            modes of thought. Socialism, whether of the Eastern Communist or Western 
            Social Democratic variety, has been consistently hostile not only 
            to Biblical Christianity but to the national division of mankind. 
            The Russian Christian writer Vadim Borisov described socialism almost 
            thirty years ago as &quot;a well-thought out plan for the destruction 
            of the Christian cosmos, a plan to turn mankind into an amorphous 
            mass.&quot;</font></p>
          <p>The fall of Communism ten years ago 
            did not discredit socialism. The Social Democratic variant is stronger 
            than ever, and continues its work of national destruction. Borisov 
            warned that the socialist promise of happiness through liberation 
            from the past and the imposition of equality was false, for &quot;an 
            impersonal, unstructured, formless existence is impossible.&quot;</font></p>
          <p>The Apostle Paul warned believers to 
            beware of &quot;false prophets and deceitful workers,&quot; for &quot;Satan 
            himself transforms himself into an angel of light&quot; (2 Corinthians 
            11:13, 14). The medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas warned Christians 
            that Satan and his angels disguise themselves <i>sub species boni</i> 
            (under the appearance of good). European Christians should be on their 
            guard against socialists posing as Christians, for the socialistic 
            dream of racial reconciliation and world unity leads to nothing less 
            than the extinction of Europeans as a separate people and the destruction 
            of their civilization. Christians must stand in defense against those 
            who would &mdash; in the name of Christ &mdash; have us abandon our lands and our 
            people. </p>

                <p>They say you can&rsquo;t judge a book 
                  by its cover, but in this case you can. The cover picture represents 
                  the three races of man, all grouped together in the same drop 
                  of what is presumably blood. Of course, despite having the word 
                  &quot;race&quot; in the subtitle and depicting races on the 
                  cover, the authors promptly assert that there is really no such 
                  thing as race. The differences we have been taught to think 
                  of as races are essentially just variations in skin color, which 
                  are nothing more than different concentrations of melanin. <i>One 
                  Blood</i> goes on to cite the very slight genetic differences 
                  between racial groups (they prefer the term &quot;people groups&quot;), 
                  but since the authors are creationists they do not mention that 
                  humans are very closely related to chimpanzees. <i>One Blood</i> 
                  even endorses the theory that human life originated in sub-Saharan 
                  Africa. This apparent conflict with creationism is nothing but 
                  an accommodation to the liberalism that has crept even into 
                  religious literature.</font></p>
                <p>The crowning achievement of <i>One 
                  Blood</i> is its blatant endorsement of interracial marriage. 
                  On page 92 there is a chart illustrating who may marry whom, 
                  the point being that Christians should not marry non-Christians. 
                  The one illustration of an &quot;unacceptable&quot; marriage 
                  is a depiction of two whites, one of whom is Christian and the 
                  other &quot;non-Christian.&quot; The two illustrations of &quot;acceptable&quot; 
                  marriages are both interracial. One is of a white man and an 
                  Asian woman (both &quot;non-Christians&quot; and therefore acceptable 
                  mates), and the third &mdash; the &quot;ideal&quot; marriage of two 
                  Christians &mdash; is that of a black man and a white woman.</font></p>
                <p>The Bible&rsquo;s &quot;Great Commission,&quot; 
                  found in the final verses of Matthew and Mark, instructs believers 
                  to preach the Gospel to all nations &mdash; not to invite them to settle 
                  in your neighborhood and marry your daughter. There was a time 
                  in the not-too-distant past when white people understood this.

  <font size="3"><p>I think the point of this article is wrong, and here is where the article really falls apart:</p>
<p>&gt; The New Testament reaffirms the national and ethnic<br/>
&gt; distinctions of the Old Testament, if anything, in<br/><br/>
&gt; stronger and clearer terms.</p>
<p>The passages cited point to an egalitarian interpretation rather than a particularist interpretation:</p>
<p><br/>
&gt; Luke wrote that God &#8220;made from one [Adam] every nation<br/><br/>
&gt; [ethnos] of mankind [anthropon] to live on all the face<br/><br/>
&gt; of the earth, having determined their appointed times,<br/><br/>
&gt; and the boundaries of their habitation&#8221; (Acts 17:26).<br/><br/>
&gt; Christ himself commanded his disciples to go and &#8220;make<br/><br/>
&gt; disciples of all the nations [ethna]&#8221; (Matthew 28:19).</p>
<p>Thus the New Testament is clear that humans have one ancestral origin, and that all racial groups are worth trying to save. <br/>
True, it does not mean that human racial groups are genetically alike, but this is irrelevant. Spiritually, humans are all humans - this is not so in many other religions!</p>
<p><br/>
&gt; Paul on numerous occasions, after he became a Christian,<br/><br/>
&gt; identified himself as belonging to the Jewish nation on<br/><br/>
&gt; the basis of birth and heritage &mdash; not merely a Jew but of a<br/><br/>
&gt; particular tribe. He was, he claimed, &#8220;of the nation of<br/><br/>
&gt; Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews&#8221;<br/><br/>
&gt; (Philippians 3:5). When he wrote to the Romans in the city<br/><br/>
&gt; of Rome, he did not claim to be Roman (except by citizenship)<br/><br/>
&gt; but Jewish: &#8220;I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham,<br/><br/>
&gt; of the tribe of Benjamin&#8221; (Romans 11:1). He referred to the<br/><br/>
&gt; Israelites as his &#8220;brethren, my kinsmen according to the<br/><br/>
&gt; flesh, who are Israelites&#8221; (Romans 9:3, 4). He also referred<br/><br/>
&gt; to the Roman Christians as his &#8220;brethren&#8221; (Romans 11:25), but<br/><br/>
&gt; he is clearly speaking in a spiritual sense.</p>
<p>1. Paul writes, &#8220;What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision? Much in every way!&#8221; What value is there in being a Gentile?</p>
<p>2. This spiritual sense in which Paul speaks of Gentiles as being his brothers is very important. Even if it may allow for biological distinctions between groups, it nullifies the <strong>philosophical</strong> barriers which separate kin from non-kin. Consider especially this:</p>
<p>&gt; Paul uses the Greek word laos (a people) to refer to both an<br/>
&gt; ethnic people, as in the people of Israel, and a spiritual<br/><br/>
&gt; people, as in the people of God. Paul&rsquo;s use of that word in<br/><br/>
&gt; both contexts proves that ethnicity is not rendered obsolete<br/><br/>
&gt; or illegitimate by coming to Christ.</p>
<p>It would seem that Christians are all one in Christ.</p>
<p><br/>
Even the Old Testament is not as racially particularistic as the writer insists. For example:</p>
<p>&gt; The Bible endorses ethnic homogeneity as a positive good<br/>
&gt; that contributes to peace, harmony, and happiness, whether<br/><br/>
&gt; it be in marriage, friendship, or society.</p>
<p>But the Bible also smiles on interethnic marriages as well; consider the famous story of Ruth the Moabitess, who is listed in as being one of Jesus&rsquo; direct ancestors!</p>
<p><br/>
&gt; Modern theologians, Bible commentators, and pastors are<br/><br/>
&gt; quick to insist that God&rsquo;s prohibition of such marriages<br/><br/>
&gt; was based on religion rather than race or ethnicity.<br/><br/>
&gt; Their shocking conclusion is that while white Christians<br/><br/>
&gt; are forbidden to marry non-Christian whites they are free<br/><br/>
&gt; to marry non-whites so long as they are Christians.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing shocking about this whatsoever; it is the natural consequence of bringing ethnic aliens into the religion. Again: &#8220;We are all brothers in Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
&gt; God does not condemn interethnic or interracial marriage<br/><br/>
&gt; per se, but He does lay down a principle that would forbid<br/><br/>
&gt; it as a common or widespread practice. </p>
<p>God sends His son through obviously mixed bloodlines; Tamar, Rahab, and Ruth are all given as ancestors of Jesus in Matthew, and all were gentiles.</p>
<p><br/>
&gt; Liberal Christians repeatedly point out that God blessed<br/><br/>
&gt; certain interethnic marriages. The examples they cite are<br/><br/>
&gt; always between Israelites and members of other Semitic<br/><br/>
&gt; peoples who were their ethnic kin (descendants of Shem).</p>
<p>This is interesting, in light of this passage from Deuteronomy 20, which is worth quoting in full:</p>
<p>______________________</p>
<p><br/>
When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the <span class="caps">LORD </span>your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the <span class="caps">LORD </span>your God gives you from your enemies. This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby. </p>
<p>However, in the cities of the nations the <span class="caps">LORD </span>your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. Completely destroy them &mdash; the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites &mdash; as the <span class="caps">LORD </span>your God has commanded you. Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the <span class="caps">LORD </span>your God. </p>
<p>______________________</p>
<p><br/>
It seems fairly clear here that:</p>
<p>1. The God of the Bible has no interest in preventing Jews from intermarrying with racially distant peoples, and in fact ordains that this is what they <strong>should</strong> do after crushing them militarily!</p>
<p>2. God only forbids them from intermarrying with their close neighbors, and this out of the harshly practical concern that His people not turn away from Him.</p>
<p><br/>
Trying to make a case for racial particularism of Christian Gentiles by using the Bible won&rsquo;t work - the Bible doesn&rsquo;t support such a case. Ever since the Great Commission, Christianity has been an inherently expansionistic and inclusionistic religion. It may not directly lead to the suicidal European immigration practices and bioegalitarian fantasies which dominate the Western world, but it is fully consistent with them.</p>
<p>The trouble with the Western world is obvious - Christianity is a rallying point for ethnic Europeans, but it also tears down philosophical barriers separating whites from ethnic competitors and leaves whites with no religious arguments for self defense. What is there for racially consdcious whites to do, abandon Christianity and turn to a white particularist religion, or try to work around an inherently inclusionistic religious tradiotion? Decisions, decisions!</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Please, can we use something a little intellectually<br/>

<p>The differences among the races are obvious and are borne<br/>
out by numerous academic studies.  These facts speak for<br/><br/>
themselves and need no further buttressing by alledging<br/><br/>
that they are supported by the diety of your choice.</p>
<p>Christianity, like most of the world&rsquo;s religions, is extremely<br/>
fragmented and is divided over every doctrine imaginable. Concensus does not exist among God&rsquo;s people.  Just look up<br/><br/>
&#8220;Churches&#8221; in the yellow pages and you will see the proof.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>&ldquo;Fourth, the project for global unity sullies the beauty and diversity of God&rsquo;s human creation, in that it suggests that the existence of different races, which vary markedly in physical appearance, is a mistake that man is to remedy by racial intermarriage. In this warped version of creation, God is the bungler and man the redeemer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a very thought provoking article and Dr. Trask is to be commended, for having refuted the sinful universalism, multiculturalism, and &ldquo;socialism&rdquo;(the combination of these three, being Communism in my book and thus the tool of Satan and nothing more) that is the mark of modern and so-called &ldquo;Christianity.&rdquo;  The above paragraph alone however, is the most thought provoking of all. It resonates with one of my deepest religious beliefs, if God created us with our different appearances and abilities as races for his reasons, who are we to challenge our creator and violate and alter these differences through miscegenation. If God had wanted us to all to be as one with each other, in a giant coffee and cream brown blob, that is what he would have created in the first place. That is why I believe multiculturalism to be evil and sinful, a false religion of false prophets; in sum, a Temple of Babel  built to serve the Marxist Multi Cult and its arrogant and sinful Communist Gurus!</p>
<p>This is why I never buckle under to the maudlin hypocritical and sanctimonious, &ldquo;we are all God&rsquo;s children&rdquo; shame tactics of the Red race-mixing opposition, when they show up to have a go at us! We are right and they are wrong; if God created whites as a distinct and special people; why would he smile on our own willing self-destruction? Moreover, it is always interesting to observe that the Multi Cult crowd forget to note, in their absurd and often demonically crazed states of outraged <br/>
&ldquo;tolerance,&rdquo; that they forget to acknowledge whites as also being  God&rsquo;s children. No, in the perverted cesspools of their so-called minds, whites are sin itself; the white race by their way of &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; must be totally exterminated! Any who call for the genocide of a people, in particular their own, cannot be on the side of God and right! It is hopeful to note, that there is now a Pope in the Vatican, that seems agree with this position on multiculturalism: &ldquo;He has criticized multiculturalism, &lsquo;which is so constantly and passionately encouraged and supported,&rsquo; because it &#8216;sometimes amounts to an abandonment and disavowal of what is our own.&rsquo;&rdquo;(Pope Benedict <span class="caps">XVI</span>: Enemy of Jihad, Robert Spencer, FrontPageMagazine.com, 4, 20, 2005; posted on the AR website below, 4, 21,2005.)</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>What the churches are doing these extremely politically correct days, where where sickeningly enough every single nonwhite minority has to be held in the highest esteem, is to try to instill much guilt and shamefulness for white people who have married or are dating their own beautiful white people. That way they might not have many white children and the preachers can feel satisfaction that they have done their job of erasing us from the earth. It is a very evil scheme what these preachers are doing these days to instill guilt and my Lord Jesus Christ would not approve of this whatsoever, as Christ <span class="caps">NEVER, EVER </span>wanted white people to be dishonored this way through extinction.</p>
<p>Rather, Christ wanted all people to preach the word of God yet still have our distiction. He never once preached about marrying another race to make God happy. The Old Testament mentions quite clearly the disfavor God looks upon race mixing marriages and children. To bolster this argument in the New Testament Christ said he came to fulfill the Law. He never talked about abolishing it, like the preachers do today. In this regard the preachers of today are really hardly any different than the very dangerous atheistic Leftists here today.</p>
<p>I pray to God that our preachers will turn their ways and ask for forgiveness of their sins they preach.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>&ldquo;Billy Graham&rsquo;s position is similar to that of the former Republican congressman from Southern California, Robert Dornan, who said before a <span class="caps">USA</span> Today editorial board meeting: &lsquo;I want to see America stay a nation of immigrants, and if we lose our Northern European stock &mdash; your coloring and mine, blue eyes and fair hair &mdash; tough! So what if 5,000 years from now we&rsquo;re all going to have a golden tan… . We&rsquo;re all going to be blended together because of travel, and because of the information highway.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well. I don&rsquo;t know about the &ldquo;good&rdquo; old Reverend Graham, but this caustic idiot Dornan got what was coming to him! His district, lost its  white majority &ldquo;coloring&rdquo; in favor of a Hispanic immigrant &ldquo;golden tan,&rdquo; with predictable results, he lost his seat to a Mexican.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very next year, Hispanics voted in Loretta Sanchez, the 36-year-old daughter of immigrants, who kept telling voters how Mexican she was. This is precisely what Mr. Dornan&rsquo;s cheerful view of immigration should have prepared him for, but did he concede defeat gracefully? No. He accused Miss Sanchez&rsquo;s supporters of vote fraud, demanded recounts, and was a thoroughly bad sport about it all. Suddenly, racial altruism had a cost, and he screamed like a stuck pig.&rdquo;(Competitive Altruism and White Self-Destruction, Dr. Ian Jobling, American Renaissance, Oct.-Nov. 2003; see AR News Archives for Friday, January 21 or the Back Issues.)</p>
<p>God works in mysterious ways at times, but if he was working here, I think his message was clear enough! I never fail to think of that quote from Dr. Jobling&rsquo;s excellent article, when I see those brazenly foolish and treasonously &ldquo;self-serving&rdquo; Hispandering remarks by ex-Congressman Dornan. Oh well, &ldquo;tough!&rdquo; As they say Comrade Dornan, be careful about what you pray for&hellip;?  <br/>

  <font size="3"><p>I was raised as a &#8220;Baptist&#8221;.  Whatever that means, but the preacher at that time nearly drove me insane at the age of ten.<br/>
What I mean by that:  He told us that we would most certainly go to hell. He screamed at us and told us we were sinners and should repent for our sins, day and night&hellip;. <br/><br/>
I couldn&rsquo;t sleep at night, I waited day and night for the &#8220;end of the world&#8221; to come.  They liked to talk about the end of the world.  They even loved to sing songs about the end of the world and who would be saved and who would <span class="caps">NOT </span>be saved.</p>
<p>I was a basket-case.  My parents said that some people just &#8220;need to get scared&#8221;.  I couldn&rsquo;t even enter a church without feeling nauseous for a very long time.</p>
<p>I have spent years trying to find answers.  Even studying the bible with Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses.<br/>
Do not misunderstand me, they are good people, but I just could never accept that we are all the same and will be judged according to how we treat each other as &#8220;brothers&#8221; and &#8220;sisters&#8221;.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>To kellye, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with you.  I am a former<br/>

tries to assert that a &#8220;real&#8221; Christian could never fall away<br/><br/>
needs to go back to their Bible and reread Hebrews 6: vs 4-6 ).</p>
<p>Religion adds nothing of value to our fight for white nationalism.  It breeds arrogance and the unwillingness<br/>
to listen.  After all, if you believe that you already have Ultimate Truth why listen to anyone else ?  This makes them<br/><br/>
less able or willing to adapt their thinking to new theories and potential solutions.  Valid avenues of attack regarding our racial self interest would be discarded because they lack proper biblical &#8220;perspective&#8221;. Any strategy that doesn&rsquo;t agree<br/><br/>
with their theology is evil and will be shunned.</p>
<p>We in the fight for White Nationalism do not need superstitious<br/>

nothing.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Believers, Agnostics, and Atheists alike,</p>
<p>When discussing any profound issue of the day, it is prudent to ask, &ldquo;What does God think?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Yes, even if you are an atheist, this question is paramount.  For if there is a God then what He thinks is all that matters.  If there is not a God, then none of this matters.  </p>
<p>Honestly, if there is nothing after this life on Earth, why even concern yourself with what happens here?  If you are just going to turn to dust, why get worked up over who marries who, what race dominates or survives, etc..  Why not just live your life for yourself and be happy with what you have and with what you attain?</p>
<p>That said, I must tell you that I do have faith in God, so I believe what we do here on Earth does matter.  So, where does that leave us?  Or more to the point of today&rsquo;s discussion, where does that leave us with race relations?  </p>
<p>From the perspective of a Christian, I have found the question of race a perplexing one.  &ldquo;Man looks on outward appearances.  God looks on the heart.&rdquo; A verse, such as that one certainly seems to demand that we should not judge by appearances.  </p>
<p>Another conundrum: since God created the races, why is it that he made them so markedly different in abilities (i.e. Blacks are faster but have a lower IQ)?  Then there are the obvious and consistent differences in behavior and accomplishments, as has been well documented on this site.  To attempt to ignore those differences in behavior and to fail plan accordingly can be a fatal mistake for the altruistic or unwary.  </p>
<p>While I believe the most valuable time spent is in attempting to learn the mind of God and how He would have us live, for the purpose of this post I am going to approach this issue from the opposite direction.  What is the mind of those who openly oppose God?</p>
<p>I am not necessarily referring to agnostics or atheists, but rather to the leftists and secularists of this country and in Europe.  In my view, as a Christian, these people are opposed to God (and are therefore wrong) on issues such as abortion, homosexuality, feminism, and, of course, the place of God in our public and private lives.  They are also incorrect in their stances on crime, justice and welfare.</p>
<p>Now we come to the issues of race and immigration.  Can it be that these same people and organizations that are dead wrong on every other important issue that we face today are somehow correct in their views of race and immigration?  As a friend of mine once said, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know what position to take on an issue, just look at the position Ted Kennedy takes, take the opposite position and you&rsquo;ll be right 98 percent of the time.&rdquo; The same philosophy is probably a good one when applied to race, immigration, and liberals. </p>
<p>The liberals, who are wrong about everything else, vilify whites, want to flood the country with foreigners, and to promote anything interracial (think Sheridan on Monday Night Football and many other scenes on TV and on film).  Perhaps they are right in trying to promote &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; et al, but they have been and are on the wrong side of most everything else.  A gambler would be playing the long shot to bet on the liberal position on any issue.  </p>
<p>What about a more personal side of race issues?  For instance, is an &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; liberal European, such as Heidi Klum &ldquo;right&rdquo; or should anyone even care when she chooses to follow the liberal lead and marry Seal?  Maybe so, it is her life and her choice after all, but could she and her decision be just another product of the collapse of the traditional Christian moral values that propelled the West to its pinnacle in 19th and 20th centuries?  Ms. Klum was already expecting their child before the marriage proposal.  It is entirely possible that she is in the midst of a series of poor decisions and choices, which is understandable given the European moral compass these days.</p>
<p>The truth is, I still am not certain what to make of each of these issues.  I know I do not like feeling like a foreigner in my own country, picking up the tab for the expense of immigration, being discriminated against by a system that hires and promotes based on race and sex rather than capability, and knowing that far too many places in our cities and suburbs are no longer safe.  Perhaps none of those issues matter to God and therefore they should not matter to me, but if the liberals have been on the wrong side almost everything else, why should they be on the right side in these cases?<br/>

<p>I woudn&rsquo;t make a judgement on Christianity based on the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses. Some denominations don&rsquo;t regard them as &#8220;Christian&#8221; at all.

  <font size="3"><p>To fellow Amren posters on the topic of Christianity, this is Prozac Death Wish.  I must say that, being an atheist, I am shocked by the lack of vilification that I have received here.  My former experiences posting on pro-Christian forums have frequently been met with venomous attacks and fiery condemnation.  So far no one has &#8220;dropped a bomb&#8221; on me yet.</p>
<p>My previous postings were not meant to irritate White Nationalists who have a religious bent.  I stand by my<br/>
statements regarding the usefulness of religion as it relates to the cause of White Nationalism, but freedom of religion is guaranteed by our Bill of Rights and I do consider myself a<br/><br/>
constitionalist.</p>
<p>My shooting buddy is a hard-core Christian Identity believer<br/>
who knows that I am an atheist. We get along fine ( which<br/><br/>
is a good thing when we are both holding assault rifles. ) We sometimes discuss our differing viewpoints.  We never soft-peddle our debates or water down our strongly felt opinions.<br/><br/>
The strength of our friendship is what allows this unlikely<br/><br/>
scenario to remain nothing more than a vigorous conversation. A<br/><br/>
sense of good will is never lost between us, and if it becomes<br/><br/>
too stressful we just change the subject.</p>
<p>Although I differ with those of you who adhere to a belief<br/>
in a spiritual realm, I would not stand in your way for the cause of White Nationalism.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>&#8220;Either the Christian religion goes extinct or the white race goes extinct.&#8221;<br/>
Christians might reword that: If the Christian religion goes extinct (which it won&rsquo;t), then the white race may go extinct.<br/><br/>
Many of the greatest achievements of our race have occurred during the centuries when white nations were Christian. It could be argued that the problems and decline of our people have coincided with the decline in Christianity in the West. That would certainly fit a Biblical pattern. &#8220;Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire, your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate as overthrown by strangers.&#8221;  Isaiah 1:7. That sounds just like the good old <span class="caps">USA </span>in the 21st century. That&rsquo;s what happens to nations that reject God. We have rejected Him as a culture. Everything is falling apart. Yet many blame God, or at least Christianity. The liberal church may be at fault in all this but they have rejected the God of the Bible, too. Please don&rsquo;t confuse God and Christ with that organization. <br/><br/>
Christianity is not a cause, a creed, or a code, as one pastor put it. It is a relationship with a person, Jesus Christ. Many of our ancestors put their faith in that person. They would have known what to do in a situation such as ours. They would have prayed and done some self-examination and probably a lot of repenting. They would have expected the same kind of deliverance Jehosaphat, Gideon, and numerous others did. There is nothing in Christianity that mandates national and racial suicide.<br/><br/>
Please study Pascal&rsquo;s Wager. Also, read &#8220;The Creator and the Cosmos&#8221; by Dr. Hugh Ross,an astrophysicist. Another excellent read for genuine truth-seekers is &#8220;The Case for Faith&#8221; by Lee Strobel. If there is any chance at all that Christianity is true, then everyone owes it to himself to at least consider it. If Christ is real and I firmly believe he is,  the only personal decision that ultimately matters is accepting or rejecting him. SY</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>To Razor, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent post reconciling White Nationalism with Christianity. To often people are willing to give up on one or the other. I think that we can have both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just wanted to say thanks, for your kind and supportive words regarding my above post. I agree with you wholeheartedly, White Nationalism and Christianity or for that matter any other religion (e.g., a White Nationalist Jew or even a White Nationalist Buddhist, as rare as that might be) are not incompatible. Unlike what Prozac Death Wish, contends with his discourteous and indirect cracks about &ldquo;voo-doo&rdquo; and &ldquo;a new German Pope&rdquo; accomplishing nothing, I ask the question, if we are without God are we not just as bad as the turgidly holier-than-thou Communist Multi Cult opposition? Why should God help our cause, if we have given up on him, or worse deny he ever existed in the first place? Is this not just as bad as promoting unnatural social arrangements in his name, while your ultimate goal is removing him from public or political considerations altogether, as is the objective of these Marxist multicultural fanatics? As I noted in my above post, God separated the races and made them different for his reasons; man ignores this at his own peril, as this thoughtful article by Dr. Trask points out. As a Catholic, I was ad infinitum instructed to believe that he planned for our lives to be a mystery. Thus, my ability to have faith in God without certainty of his overall plan or intentions. I am not childishly blinded by this faith, to the point that I can not grasp the reality of our situation; however, I am not foolish enough to think that God will not abandon the white race, if we abandon both him and ourselves too!   </p>
<p>I do not hold that I have all the answers. I do not hold that I can prove that God exists, but I do honestly believe that he does! I have always been perplexed by those who do not believe in God; just as I will never understand, a Christian who is threatened by the possibility that extraterrestrial life might exist elsewhere in the universe? We live on one small planet, in one small solar system, in an average sized galaxy, in a vast and largely unknown universe. However, in this universe there is an obvious order and design, which I believe indicates a creator who we call God. When he decides to spell everything out for us directly, he will. Until that day, we can only thank him for the gifts he has given us (for example, our own personal racial consciousness and survival instincts, in an age where this is so rare) and work with them!</p>

<p>There is a strong chance your efforts will be doomed to failure.  If it is a prerequisite to be pagan in order to love one&rsquo;s self enough to want to marry someone similar and to raise similar children and if it is a prerequisite to be a pagan to pursue and demand equal treatment under the law, then this movement most likely will not succeed.</p>
<p>Also, take note that the largest white families are generally Christian families.  Christians value family and children much more than their secular humanist counterparts.  If the Christians in America are not with you, then this movement will always be a small minority movement without sufficient power to enact change.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>To David,</p>
<p>Your post was excellent and thought provoking as well.</p>
<p>I particularly liked your opening point:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, if there is nothing after this life on Earth, why even concern yourself with what happens here? If you are just going to turn to dust, why get worked up over who marries who, what race dominates or survives, etc.. Why not just live your life for yourself and be happy with what you have and with what you attain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, the only concern that would matter, would be if you were far sited enough to be concerned about your children and grandchildren. Other than that nothing and you could avoid this concern, simply by having no children at all. I am not advocating this, but only stating an obvious and logical point.</p>
<p>In regards to religion, I keep an open mind. As I noted to Razor above, I know that I don&rsquo;t have all the answers; however, I always have a lot of questions. One concept that I have never discounted totally (despite a Catholic upbringing and my overall Christian beliefs) is the possibility that reincarnation might play a role in the whole grand scheme of things. This does not mean that I hold that we come back as dogs or that I was once Alexander the Great, only that this concept is not out of the question, in my book. In all honesty, if the concept has any validity and most of the more thoughtful and reputable advocates of this belief are to be understood, we come back into our family lines.</p>
<p>Just to be a bit thought provoking myself on this topic, if this is the case Ms. Klum sure is getting the raw end of the deal with being impregnated by Mr. Seal, is she not? This would also put a whole new spin on your point: &ldquo;It is entirely possible that she is in the midst of a series of poor decisions and choices, which is understandable given the European moral compass these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I stress, I wrote this to be thought provoking and to a point humorous! Not to advocate that reincarnation is anything other than a possible (if unlikely) answer to the afterlife and what happens there?</p>
<p>Best wishes to you David and All,</p>

The Baptists scared me to death at a young age though and the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses were pushier than any insurance agent or telemarketer.</p>
<p>The Witnesses start out wanting to come once a week and then they want you to start attending meetings 2-4 times a week.<br/>
I found myself always having to make excuses and apologies for not attending.<br/><br/>
What really was the last straw though, was I was ill and called to cancel our scheduled bible study.<br/><br/>
I had had an operation and was on medication and needed to get some sleep.  I explained this, but she had some circuit overseer with her that day and would not take &#8220;No&#8221; for an answer.<br/><br/>

  <font size="3"><p>Even within some Christian churches in recent years there has fortunately been disagreement and even outright dissention on this fashionable mandate pushing mixed marriage.</p>
<p>When I lived in Ohio about three years ago the main Columbus paper had articles about several local pastors refusing to perform wedding ceremonies for interracial couples.  The articles appeared over several years and involved different White clergymen, who when interviewed stated in no uncertain terms that mixed marriages were against Christian teachings.  Their refusal to perform the multi-racial nuptuals garnered the usual cries of &#8220;haters&#8221; and &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; from the resident pro-mixing leftists and minorities.  I guess Jesse Jackson must have been busy, since somehow he did not show up in town to bolster the pro-miscegenation agenda through protest marches and candlelight vigils.</p>
<p>I am glad at least a few White pastors had the guts to take a stand and go public with it.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>From David&rsquo;s post above:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are just going to turn to dust why get worked up over who marries who, what race dominates or survives etc.?  Why not just live your life for yourself and be happy with what you have and with what you attain?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because even when keeping religion out of the question we here who are concerned residents of rapidly disappearing white communities take the long view as to the ramifications racial survival has for our children and grandchildren.  There is an increasingly outdated notion held by whites that we want our children to live better than ourselves, for children to do better than their parents.(Not only economically, but in the more intangible terms of &#8220;quality of life&#8221;).  My children will be among the first generation of adults who as white citizens in a formerly white country won&rsquo;t enjoy the quality life that I as an adult white or my parents had.  This would not have to happen if we could avoid losing our sense of connectedness as a race and subverting our natural tendency to marry among our own.</p>
<p>Before our countries were being run by multi-culti brainwashing leftists, generations of whites looked toward the future as they built their countries and moved us forward into modern times.  These builders had in mind making a contribution to bring about the societal conditions that would benefit their white descendents.  That&rsquo;s why the Constitution was written as it was originally and until 1965 immigration policies were geared toward encouraging white settlement and keeping out non-whites.  Our ancestors that devised these policies were thinking of our future well-being.</p>
<p>The problem is that these principles have been contorted to favor non-whites over ourselves, definitely not in keeping with what our ancestors had in mind when erecting our great white nations.  Lucky for us they did not concern themselves with immediate gratification (like David suggests they should have), instead they sought to insure our survival.  They did not intend for white nations to become some sort of free-for-all for blacks, yellows and browns!  They wanted to ensure excellent societal conditions for their extended family, their fellow whites.</p>
<p>We whites need to take our cue from our thoughtful ancestors now to ensure a bright future for our white descendents.  They deserve to inherit the nations that their white ancestors built for them.  The only way our white children can do this is to take pride in their white identity, build communities with whites and keep their white lineages going. It is for our children&rsquo;s sake that today&rsquo;s whites need to act now and not just &#8220;live for today&#8221; like David advocates!<br/>

<p>A being that is supposedly perfect in every respect could surely create something more sensible than this.

  <font size="3"><p>&#8220;If it is a prerequisite to be pagan in order to love one&rsquo;s self enough to want to marry someone similar and to raise similar children and if it is a prerequisite to be a pagan to pursue and demand equal treatment under the law, then this movement most likely will not succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
The Christians <span class="caps">THEMSELVES </span>have already made these prerequisites.  </p>
<p>Look again at this review of <span class="caps">ONE BLOOD</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;The crowning achievement of One Blood is its blatant endorsement of interracial marriage. On page 92 there is a chart illustrating who may marry whom, the point being that Christians should not marry non-Christians. The one illustration of an &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; marriage is a depiction of two whites, one of whom is Christian and the other &#8220;non-Christian.&#8221; The two illustrations of &#8220;acceptable&#8221; marriages are both interracial. One is of a white man and an Asian woman (both &#8220;non-Christians&#8221; and therefore acceptable mates), and the third &mdash; the &#8220;ideal&#8221; marriage of two Christians &mdash; is that of a black man and a white woman.&#8221;</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Dr. Trask is to be commended for his fine, thoughtful and circumspect article on the racialistic implications of the Bible.  On all essential points he appears to be correct, and his words have easily withstood, for example, the criticisms of earlier posts. <br/>
Christianity has indeed fallen onto hard times.  Satan, with a great deal of human aid, has used egalitarian Liberalism and Marxism to subvert traditional, Biblically-based Christianity.<br/><br/>
That much is very clear.<br/><br/>
If white nationalism and the white race are to survive and flourish, we as white nationalists must do our theological and historical homework, and then take back the Christian churches.<br/><br/>
Theological truths are by definition fundamental truths about the nature of God, the nature of His creation, and the nature of the relationship between these two, God and creation.  On the other hand, the truths of racialism are fundamental, critically important but neglected and concealed truths about the Divinely-made salient, differentiating differences that exist among the various races of man, Negroid, Caucasiod, Mongoloid. </p>
<p>Men cannot governed themselves well when they refuse to base their governments on an honest view of the various differences  that exist between individual men, and that exist between the various races of man.  Racialism is important because it highlights neglected and suppressed truths whose neglect and suppression are a main cause of our disintegrating families, societies, and civilization.  I would add that the neglect and suppression of racialistic truths in our world today is one of the main causes of eternal souls being alienated from God and lost forever.  This last point should rouse us to action if nothing else does.  (I have two young sons, so I feel this concern most keenly.) The modern bastardized American society is becoming, more and more, a moral cesspool and spiritual wasteland.  A sickening and unholy spectacle, to say the least! </p>
<p>The science of politics, properly understood, is concerned with wise legislation that trains men in proper ways of living.  Politics then, when seen in its true and proper Providential light, is a holy science, an extension of theology, concerned with producing virtuous characters and souls in this earthly life.  Because we have allowed politics to become increasingly corrupted via Satanic influences, more and more souls are being lost every day. At the very center of this Satanic influence is the egalitarian denial of the racialistic truths of God&rsquo;s wondrous, varied, and differentiated Creation.</p>
<p>Traditional, Bible-based Christianity is not just one belief system among many:  it is the <span class="caps">TRUTH </span>about us, the world we live in, and the Almighty Goodness that made it. Racialism, understood as the honest and forthright acknowledgement of socially, politically and spiritually significant differences between the various races of man, is an essential and ultimately irrepressible part of God&rsquo;s creation. </p>
<p>White nationalism, to succeed, must march under the banner of a truly reformed Christianity.  It&rsquo;s time for a racialistic <span class="caps">REFORMATION </span>or rediscovery of the one true Christian faith.<br/>
It&rsquo;s time for a White America Party with a rock-solid racialistically-reformed and theologically-restored Christian foundation. It&rsquo;s time to win back the hearts and minds of enough white Americans to gain political power, and to set about restoring and transforming America.  It&rsquo;s time for an American Renaissance; it&rsquo;s time for a social, political, governmental, cultural, and spiritual rebirth of our nation.  Let&rsquo;s do it, my friends.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>In digging up passages from Scripture that point to national divisions, Mr. Trask forgets the commandments God sets down in dealing with people from other nations. For instance, God says that &#8220;You shall also love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt&#8221; (Deut. 10.19; New Revised Standard Version). Somehow the lovin&rsquo; vibe is absence from <span class="caps">AR.</span> Further, aliens resident in the land of Israel (Christendom, if we want to make the extension) are to be considered citizens: &#8220;The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt: I am the <span class="caps">LORD </span>your God&#8221; (Lev. 19.34).</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">LORD</span> God also advocates social programs for immigrants: &#8220;When you have finished paying all the tithe of your produce in the third year [&hellip;], giving it to the Levites, the aliens, the orphans, and the widows&hellip;&#8221; (Deut. 26.12). &#8220;Your&#8221; tax money that is going to the poor is not your money at all, but gifts from a graceful God. Also read the preceding two or three chapters. You cannot say that &#8220;alien&#8221; refers to other people from the same &#8220;race.&#8221; Deut. 26.5 Equates Israelites as &#8220;aliens&#8221; living in the land of Egypt – and for all of Mr. Trask&rsquo;s hermeneutic hopscotch around Ruth, he does differentiate between Hamites and Semites in his discussion of Hagar.</p>
<p>Foreigners are also to have their due in government. 2 Samuel speaks of two alien messengers to King David: an Amalekite (1.13) does not fare too well, but his punishment would have been no different had he been an Israelite. More interesting is the Cushite (Ethiopian, that is, black) who serves David better than Israelites by telling the truth (18.21-32). </p>
<p>It seems then, that the evils of white supremacy also include heresy. </p>
<p><span class="caps">P.S.</span> With regards to Mark William Henshaw&rsquo;s post way up there, other religions do have a sense of human equality (not always realized, of course): that is why pilgrims to Mecca all wear the same clothing. Indeed, for all of Judaism&rsquo;s supposed nationalism and exclusivism, we do not get this kind of political account for the improvement of aliens in the New Testament. <br/>

  <font size="3"><p><span class="caps">OK,</span> White Canadian, by your own hermeneutic &#8220;reasoning&#8221;, the Isrealites should have welcomed the Philistines with open arms.<br/>
As to your segue into modern America, <span class="caps">ILLEGAL </span>immigrants are indeed Philistines in every way. </p>
<p>The Hebrew people were by no means illegal immigrants into Egypt. Try reading the story of Joseph in Genesis, especially the ending, when Jacob and his sons move into Egypt.</p>
<p>Obviously, the passages you refer to above are speaking of non invasive aliens (visitors or temporary sojourners, as the Isrealites once were), not invading, conquering hordes.</p>
<p>Indeed, to segue to modern Israel, that &#8220;Jewish State&#8221; rightly struggles to stay just that, a Jewish state. Thus, Jew haters hurl such lying abuse as &#8220;Zionism is racism&#8221; and equate Jewish nationalism with Naziism. By your standard, modern Israel should throw open its doors to the Arab hordes and just blend out of existence. Not all conquering hordes need use the sword.</p>
<p>In the Bible, once Israel has grown too large, God removes them from Egypt. He would have done so whether or not the Egyptians had remained friendly and kind to the Hebrews. God had prepared a land of their own for the Hebrews.</p>
<p>In the taking of that land, the nations who occupy it are dispossed, not by the power of man (the Hebrews), but by the power of God acting through Israel.</p>
<p>Thus, in the Scripture, God continues to set the bounderies of individual nations and peoples, as when he divided them earlier in Genesis. This is a plain and unembelished exegesis of the Old Testament on this subject.</p>
<p>Of course, all laws of love toward neighbor in all the Bible apply today and a Christian America has welcomed, and made equals of more <span class="caps">LEGAL </span>immigrants than any nation, ever. </p>
<p>That is not the point. The point is the legitimacy of national and racial survival. If a black African Christian nation and people were, in the Twilight Zone, turning away white legal applicants and illegal invaders out of concerns about becoming a disposessed minority in their own land, would you call those black African Christians, and their nation, &#8220;evil&#8221;?</p>
<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>let&rsquo;s examine your charge that, &#8220;It seems then, that the evils of white supremacy also include heresy&#8221;. Though some commentors on this comment board display a wretched and evil attitude toward non-whites (as in Mark William Henshaw&rsquo;s horrified words, in which he is shocked&hellip;shocked !, that &#8220;the New Testament is clear that humans have one ancestral origin, and that all racial groups are worth trying to save&#8221; whose exegeticaly silly and morally vile postings you rightly, if gently, rebuke, &#8220;other religions do have a sense of human equality&#8221;), <span class="caps">THIS</span> IS <span class="caps">NOT </span>a white supremacist magazine or web site. That is a calumny that displays either sinfully irresponsible ignorance or deliberatly cunning mandacity. </p>
<p>So also to the charge of heresy. As a great Christian pastor taught me long ago, only fools or ignoramuses throw the heresy word around lightly. You have proven exactly zero heresy in Dr. Trask&rsquo;s article, as I have demonstrated above. Your false charge, however, is an example of denunciation under the modern day Inquisition of the Regime of Political Correctness.</p>
<p>While AR is by no means a Christian publication, and has sadly displayed serious, far too much, and unbalanced skepticism toward Christians and Christianity (much less so toward Jews and Judaism, thankfully), <span class="caps">DR.</span> Trask&rsquo;s article provided a sufficient enough tip-of-the-hat to Christians, and especially to an Evangelical Biblicist like me (who happens, like Dr. Trask, to accept racial reality), to motivate me originally to subscribe. I look each month for another such article or biblical perspective on race. None have, sadly, appeared so far. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, I eat the meat and spit out the bones with regard to <span class="caps">AR.</span> It is not perfect. Neither is it evil. </p>
<p>However, neither are races alike. Race is real. Serious and very significant racial differences are real. The division of man by nation and race is real, call it by God or by micro evolution. It is not &#8220;evil&#8221; to call reality, reality.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I would also like to say that an evangelical does not accept the Bible as inerrant; he accepts the <span class="caps">MESSAGE </span>of the Bible (particularly the New Testament) as inerrant, inspired by the Holy Spirit, and absolutely vital to mankind today.</p>
<p>Although we have come too far to make any return to fundamentalism by any intelligent person impossible, I think that it is in a relationship to Christ that a person finds his true self  &mdash;  personal as well as racial.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>I meant to say that we have come too far to make any return to fundamentalism <span class="caps">POSSIBLE  </span>(not impossible).  What I meant was that educated persons know that myth has an important place in the Bible.  But myth does <span class="caps">NOT </span>mean &#8220;something untrue.&#8221;  Rather, it is truth expressed in poetic language. No rational person would believe that a knowledge of good and evil is gained by eating a fruit, or that immortality is gained by eating another fruit (see Genesis, chapters 1 &amp; 2).  The very language is mythologic and poetic.  Ditto for Jonah and the whale. </p></font><p>Posted
