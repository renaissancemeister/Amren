<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Queen Margrethe II of Denmark has called on the country &ldquo;to show our opposition to Islam&rdquo;, regardless of the opprobium such a stance provokes abroad.</p>
<p>Her comments further undermined the image of Denmark as a liberal haven for those seeking a new life in northern Europe.</p>
<p>The Danish government has already been accused of fuelling xenophobia by introducing measures which effectively closed the country to asylum seekers.</p>
<p>But in overtly political passages from an official biography published yesterday Queen Margrethe makes comments certain to complicate her nation&rsquo;s relationship with Muslims.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;We are being challenged by Islam these years &mdash; globally as well as locally. It is a challenge we have to take seriously. We have let this issue float about for too long because we are tolerant and lazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to show our opposition to Islam and we have to, at times, run the risk of having unflattering labels placed on us because there are some things for which we should display no tolerance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when we are tolerant, we must know whether it is because of convenience or conviction.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Queen, who turns 65 tomorrow and has reigned since 1972, wields no political power but does occasionally comment on political issues.</p>
<p>Denmark has seriously limited immigration in the past three years and the anti-immigrant Danish People&rsquo;s Party, an ally of the centre-Right government, has pushed through laws making it harder to bring in foreign spouses or qualify for asylum.</p>
<p>The queen told her biographer, Annelise Bistrup, apparently referring to Muslim fundamentalists: &ldquo;There is something impressive about people for whom religion imbues their existence, from dusk to dawn, from cradle to grave.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She said she understood how disaffected young Muslims might find refuge in religion. This tendency should be fought by encouraging Muslims to learn Danish so they could integrate better, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should not be content with living next to each other. We should rather live together.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>The Queen had it right with &#8220;showing opposition to Islam&#8221; but ends with, &#8220;We should not be content with living next to each other. We should rather live together.&rdquo; Dream on Queenie, that isn&rsquo;t going to happen or if it does, it&rsquo;ll happen about the same time that a Catholic or Protestant Church goes up in Mecca. What does western civilization owe to Muslims? Why would we bend over to accomodate a people who have been our adversaries for centuries? I&rsquo;m still trying to figure this out.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We have to show our opposition to Islam and we have to, at times, run the risk of having unflattering labels placed on us because there are some things for which we should display no tolerance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I find this to be a very positive, hopeful, and exciting story! A life time of reading between the lines, indicates that Queen Margrethe II is not just giving a positive nod to what the current government of Denmark is doing, but calling on them to escalate their actions. In effect, &lsquo;crush Islam on our soil ladies and gentlemen and save our country, by any means necessary and without mercy, regardless of what the rest of Europe or the World &ldquo;community&rdquo; thinks.&rsquo; Remember, this is not just some political elitist who is pandering for votes; this is a woman who holds her status by birth and has more to lose than gain, in relation to her fellow royals in Europe. Thus, her stance is very brave and honorable, in this age of fashionable multiculturalism and politically correct designer doublespeak. </p>
<p>God bless Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, for putting her people&rsquo;s interests above her own international &ldquo;image&rdquo; and &ldquo;popularity&rdquo;! </p>

					<p>I agree with you 100% Veritas, but I want to point out it was because we hated them so much, that it drove us to be as powerful as we are now.</p>
<p>You may refer to it as the &#8220;Dark Ages&#8221;, but we finally learnt racial cohesion, something that has given us a huge advantage over every other race.</p>
<p>When they were riding around on horse-back with curved swords, our people were riding around in full plate armor and Bastard Swords. 200 Knights Templar were able to kill over 2000 Islamics in one battle alone.</p>
<p>As for Denmark itself, I would be horrified if the once glorious history of the Vikings was to be ended by an Islamic over-run, these immigration policies now are a good step in the right direction, lets just hope that they muslims screw up some how and them and their whole bloody family gets kicked out.</p>

					<p>The Queen of Denmark better watch out.<br>
Doesn&rsquo;t she know what happened to Theo van Gogh, among other opponents of Islam.<br><br>
Not that she&rsquo;s truly an opponent, if she was she would want to see them all kicked out of her country, but what she said would be enough to set them in motion.</p>
<p>They are probably plotting how to get rid of her right now!!!</p>

					<p>  For once in my life, I wish I were a Dane, rather than a Celt.  This lady is a real Queen now, and not some appendage to a minor European state government.  We might be back to Divine Right someday, but we&rsquo;ll have a better appreciation for it in future.  This is wonderful: someone with unquestioned, if largely ceremonial authority says, &#8220;Enough&#8221;.<br>
  This is not the beginning of the end for the Invasion of the West, but it is the End of the Beginning.  We have a hard road ahead of us, but look, the sun is rising, and we walk along a river.  The way is obvious, and the night gone.<br><br>

					<p>I second John PM in a heartfelt &#8216;G-d bless the Queen&rsquo;!!!  About time someone with authority, and not just ranting commoners, seide whad needs to be seid.  I heartily applaud Her Majesty&rsquo;s observation that Whites are sometimes too tolerant, perhaps because of their &#8220;love thy neighbor&#8221; Christian traditions wrongly applied to unloving incorrigible psychopaths; and often they are also mentally lazy, or just plain stupid, in failing to perceive threats to their cultural future and racial survival.  Why don&rsquo;t we draw strength from our good old Danish roots (Beowulf, King Canute et al.), slay the Grendel of non-White immigration, and take to the hwalrad once again to spread truth, morality, Germanic freedoms and White civilization, if only through the cybersphere as some of us attempt to do on this site.  Any rapists, adulterers and murderers could be thrown into the Danish peat bogs with a rope around their necks to be re-discovered and analyzed for their genetic defects by Nordic scientists 6,000 years from now.  And if we have foolish and improvident gamblwers, they could be wage-contracted south to the ag-business corporations (latifundia) of Sicily and the northern regions of Africa pars.  A right festive and Happy Birthday to Her Majesty.  Long may she reign!</p>

					<p>Denmark is a tiny country consisting of a small peninsula and several islands, more or less. The Danes have no choice but to oppose the Muslims or else be driven into the sea or be killed.</p>
<p>North Americans flee to slightly safer locations constantly to avoid the confrontations necessary because there is space available. But for how long can they do this?</p>
<p>A courageous Danish Queen may very well outshine the men in the American Congress and White House.</p>

					<p>Great to finally hear of A White European royal with the guts and brains to speak for our side against the Muslim invasion. Too bad the British Queen is senile and reads the traitor speeches written by PC New Labor types congratulating Robert Mugabe on the aniversary of his nation&rsquo;s independence from Britan and also the senile queen&rsquo;s Christmas speech telling all her Brit subjects to welcome Muslim immigrants to the glorious multi cult new Britain.</p>
<p>Well, looks like this Danish royal knows the score. I have always liked the Danes - like the Finns a proud independent White nation who understand their national identity is all the matters.</p>
<p>Here is an interesting article about another great White royal _ Queen Isabella of Spain who expelled all the Muslims from Spain in 1492. Dare we hope for another women leader like her?\</p>

					<p>There is <span class="caps">ABSOLUTELY </span>no way to integrate with Arabs, Africans and Muslims. They are an alien race, culture and religion. </p>
<p>In fact, Islam is <span class="caps">NOT </span>a religion but a form of warfare, approved of by a &#8220;god&#8221;, but its entire doctrine is world conquest. </p>
<p>Most people do not know that Mohammed, a child rapist and homosexual, was a military &#8220;general&#8221; who developed Islam as a technique to conquer. It works</p>

					<p>&#8220;We are being challenged by Islam these years-globally as well as locally. It is a challenge we have to take seriously. We have let this issue float about for too long becouse we are tolerant and lazy.&#8221; </p>
<p>Holy Hans Christian Anderson but she puts them all to shame. Bush, Blair, Chirac, her third cousin Queen Elizabeth II-the whole tolerant, lazy, greedy, cowardly &#8216;throw in the towel&rsquo; lot.</p>

					<p>The queen says, &ldquo;We should not be content with living next to each other. We should rather live together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pure socialist utopianism.  It&rsquo;s going to die a hard death in northern Europe.  These Germanic/Nordic types were the originators of socialist doctrine (Marx grew up in N. Germany) and my guess is that this area around the Baltic will be its last bastion.  By the way, it was always the socialists that both the Nazis and the Communists most feared.  The Nazis feared them because left wing socialists had a very plausible chance of winning elections&hellip;and they hated them because of their multicultural/de-racinated ideology which threatened the very foundation of Western Civilization.  The Communists hated the socialists because  they were opposed to the dictatorship of the proletariat, and thus were a serious obstacle to power.  The socialist parasites didn&rsquo;t want to <span class="caps">OWN </span>anything.   They just wanted to <span class="caps">TAX </span>everthing.  The Danish Queen is probably a well meaning person, but personally, I don&rsquo;t think she has a clue.  Her instincts are good, but it will require some heavy blasting to get the Danish people out of the fix they are in.  Utopian homilies of the Rodney King type will not work.  </p>

<p>Another dispatch from the <span class="caps">MTV </span>generation.

<p>I saw that post from &#8216;Sarah&rsquo; (her e-mail suggests she might be black, but w/e). The &#8216;ranters&rsquo; on here are usually indignant white feminazis, who also happen to be illiterate.</p>
<p>Btw, you forgot &#8216;monarcy&rsquo; and &#8216;noone&rsquo; (never mind the lack of capitalization and grammar)!!<br>

					<p>&ldquo;We should not be content with living next to each other. We should rather live together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believe that the Qu&rsquo;ran teaches the Muslims that they should not make friends with Christians and Jews because Christians and Jews are friends with each other. It would seem, therefore, that the &#8216;living together&rsquo; will be something of a one-way street.</p>
<p>When non-Muslims go to Muslims lands the locals are at pains to explain to the newcomers that all the adjustments will be by the newcomers to the locals and nothing whatsoever from the locals to the newcomers. Christians, for example, cannot drink alcohol in most Islamic countries.</p>
<p>I submit that it will be sensible for the Danes and the others to explain to prospective samplers of the Western lifestyle that the newcomers do all the adjusting or else cancel the trip to the airport. I am not against people from distant lands coming to Western Europe, North America and Australasia but I do fervently believe that it should be made made plain and clear to them that they have to be prepared to change their ways in entirety because the host people will not compromise and become semi-Muslims in exchange for their presence.</p>

					<p>We Danes love our Queen. She really cares about her people, not like other royalty that just pretend. Sometimes I wish royalty  had real political power here in Denmark, so that Things Would Get Done, but then again, you&rsquo;re seldom in luck regarding royalty: a few years down the line, we could have a bad king or queen. Still, her oldest son seems to be og good king material. He&rsquo;s been in the toughest military unit in the world (the Sirius patrol in North-Eastern Greenland), he has stopped being a playboy and has settled down, getting ready to do some serious kinging. Oh, and he looks nice on stamps.<br>
About the Queens comment about living together rather than living next to each other, it is really just empty words that someone like her sometimes say, so as to not sound too &#8220;mean&#8221;.</p>

					<p>What a disgusting, racist queen-I&rsquo;m ashamed to be a dane.</p>
<p>As for te rest of you who support her, you are nothing but like those crazy islamic fundementalists! No our world has gone crazy, there are too many people like the queen of Denmark and her followers (ie narrow minded racists!)</p>
<p><span class="caps">P.S.</span> Racisim originally came from those crazy crusaders who killed innocent Jews and Muslims just for land. No wonder the Jews and Muslims still hate us.</p>

					<p>Ingrid, your lament is echoed all over the world. Unfortunately it is the death-song of culture (yours and mine).<br>
I can guess your affiliations already. Green Peace, global warming, save the whales, tolerance of homos, drug liberal. Have I missed anything? Oh, yeah&hellip;&#8221;why can&rsquo;t we get along with Islam? It&rsquo;s a religion of peace.&#8221;<br><br>
Some people, who respect your right to be a cretin, never-the-less have to go and defend you rights. One day, with maturity, you will be grateful&hellip;. and ashamed.</p>
