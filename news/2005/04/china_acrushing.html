			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, Apr. 13</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BEIJING &mdash; China is directing a crushing campaign of religious repression against Muslim Uighurs in the name of anti-separatism and counter-terrorism, a report by two US-based human rights groups said yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At its most extreme, peaceful activists practicing their religion in ways that the party and government deem unacceptable are arrested, tortured, and at times executed,&rdquo; said the 114-page report by Human Rights Watch and Human Rights in China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The harshest punishments are saved for those accused of involvement in so-called separatist activity, which officials increasingly term &lsquo;terrorism&rsquo; for domestic and external consumption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report, &ldquo;Devastating Blows: Religious Repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang&rdquo;, is based on previously undisclosed Communist Party and government documents.</p>
<p>It also draws on local regulations, official newspaper accounts, and interviews conducted in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uighurs are seen by Beijing as an ethno-nationalist threat to the Chinese state,&rdquo; said Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Islam is perceived as underpinning Uighur ethnic identity, China has taken draconian steps to smother Islam as a means of subordinating Uighur nationalist sentiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report claims to unveil for the first time &ldquo;the complex architecture of law, regulation, and policy in Xinjiang that denies Uighurs religious freedom, and by extension freedom of association, assembly, and expression&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chinese policy and law enforcement stifle religious activity and thought even in school and at home,&rdquo; it said.</p>
<p>Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority of eight million whose traditional homeland lies in the oil-rich Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in northwest China, have become increasingly fearful for their cultural survival and traditional way of life as China makes inroads into the area.</p>
<p>An intense internal migration drive has witnessed the arrival of more than 1.2 million ethnic Chinese settlers over the past decade and many Uighurs desire greater autonomy, with some wishing for a separate state of East Turkestan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worldwide campaign against terrorism has given Beijing the perfect excuse to crack down harder than ever in Xinjiang,&rdquo; said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other Chinese enjoy a growing freedom to worship, but the Uighurs, like the Tibetans, find that their religion is being used as a tool of control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report said half of the inmates in Xinjiang labor camps have been jailed without trial or judicial review, for allegedly engaging in separatist activities.</p>
<p>At a more mundane level, Uighurs face strict prohibition on celebrating religious holidays, studying religious texts or showing their religion at state institutions including schools.</p>
<p>Uighur government officials or workers in state institutions or state-owned enterprises are even prohibited from growing beards, a long-held Muslim tradition, it said.</p>
<p>The Chinese government also vets those who can be Islamic clerics.</p>
<p>The rights groups called on the international community to press China to repeal the regulations and end policies and practices of discrimination against Uighurs.</p>
<p>China rebutted the accusations yesterday, and insisted separatists colluded with international terrorists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to point out that all tribes in Xinjiang enjoy all the civil rights under the constitution, including religious freedom,&rdquo; Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;East Turkestan forces colluded with international terrorist groups inside and outside China to create large quantities of terrorist acts, threatening the peace and stability of China and the region.&rdquo;</p>
