						<p>What accounts for the extraordinary 
          expansion of British power in the 18th and 19th centuries? Most &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; 
          academics offer economic reasons for British success against European 
          powers, and take the view that Western technological superiority accounts 
          for colonial expansion. My study of the British army of the Napoleonic 
          era suggests a different explanation: the moral power of the British 
          soldier, as manifested in his devotion to his regiment, to his nation 
          and – when he was fighting colonial wars – to his race. Patriotic conviction 
          together with contempt for foreigners made the average British soldier 
          the best in the world. 
        <p><font size="+1">The Invincible 
          Duke </font>
        <p>The British army under the 
          command of the Duke of Wellington won 15 general engagements between 
          1808 and 1815 without suffering a single defeat. Its victories shattered 
          the myth of French invincibility and inspired the resistance of the 
          other European nations. <p>

The most sincere assessment 
          of British arms came from the enemy. The French marshal Nicolas Soult 
          described the victors after his defeat at Albuera in 1811 with rueful 
          sarcasm: &ldquo;[T]here 
          is no beating these troops in spite of their generals. I always thought 
          they were bad soldiers; now I am sure of it. I had turned their right, 
          pierced their center and everywhere victory was mine, but they did not 
          know how to run.&rdquo; Another 
          French observers, General Chambray, praised the British infantry for 
          its &ldquo;orderliness, 
          impetus and resolution to fight with the bayonet.&rdquo; 
        <p>A Prussian observer left 
          this description of Wellington&rsquo;s army: 
        <blockquote>&ldquo;For a battle, 
          there is not perhaps in Europe an army equal to the British, that is 
          to say none whose tuition, discipline, and whole military tendency, 
          is so purely and exclusively calculated to giving battle. The British 
          soldier is vigorous, well-fed, by nature highly brave and intrepid, 
          trained to the most rigorous discipline and admirably well-armed. The 
          infantry resist the attack of cavalry with great confidence, and when 
          taken in the flank or rear, British troops are less disconcerted than 
          any other European Army.&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p>Although it is the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s forces that are of particular 
          interest to us here, the British infantry had long been redoubtable, 
          and maintained its prowess well after the Iron Duke&rsquo;s day. A Spanish 
          chronicler, writing in 1486, left us this description of a force of 
          English bowmen: 
        <blockquote>&ldquo;This cavalier 
          was from the island of England and brought with him a train of his vassals, 
          men who had been hardened in certain civil wars which had raged in their 
          country&hellip; . They were withal of great pride, but it was not like 
          our own inflammable Spanish pride&hellip; . [T]heir pride was silent and 
          contumelious. Though from a remote and somewhat barbarous island, they 
          yet believed themselves the most perfect men on earth&hellip; .With all 
          this, it must be said of them that they were marvelous good men in the 
          field, dexterous archers and powerful with the battleaxe. In their great 
          pride and self-will, they always sought to press in their advantage 
          and take the post of danger&hellip; . They did not rush forward fiercely, 
          or make a brilliant onset, like the Moorish and Spanish troops, but 
          went into the fight deliberately and persisted obstinately and were 
          slow to find out when they were beaten.&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p>Likewise, in 1854, two years 
          after Wellington&rsquo;s death, the armies he had commanded were still an 
          astonishing force. The battle of Alma, during the Crimean War, gave 
          rise to this first-hand account: 
        <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip; the Grenadiers 
          and Coldstreamers [and Scots Guards], though under a deadly fire, formed 
          into line with as much precision and lack of hurry as if they had been 
          on the parade ground, and began deliberately to advance up the glacis 
          toward the Great Redoubt. 
        <p>&ldquo;It was an unforgettable 
          sight. The men marched as if they were taking part in a review. Storm 
          after storm of bullets, grape, shrapnel, and round shot tore through 
          them, man after man fell, but the pace never altered, the line closed 
          in and continued, &lsquo;ceremoniously and with dignity,&rsquo; as an eyewitness 
          wrote, on its way&hellip; . The Guards marched into the Great Redoubt, 
          and there was a shout of triumph so loud that William Howard Russell 
          [correspondent for The Times] heard it on the opposite bank – the battle 
          of the Alma had been won. 
        <blockquote>&ldquo;A French officer 
          turned to [British Colonel] Evelyn Wood &hellip; . &lsquo;Our men could not have 
          done it,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p>How were the British capable 
        of such feats of arms? It was partially the result of intense training. 
        The great French military theorist Baron de Jomini believed only British 
        troops were adequately trained to fight in a thin, two-deep battle line. 
        It required a maximum of discipline to maneuver in this unwieldy formation; 
        less trained troops required a deeper formation to maintain cohesion.&nbsp; 
        <p>In addition, British troops 
          displayed a tremendous corporate loyalty, not only to their regiments 
          but to their nation. Almost alone among the armies of the 17th and 18th 
          centuries, the British army possessed no permanent mercenary units. 
          It was always a national force. As the historian of 18th century warfare, 
          Christopher Duffy, writes: &ldquo;the 
          most pronounced moral traits of the English were violence and patriotism. 
          &hellip; All classes were united in their contempt for foreigners.&rdquo; 
          It was this ferocious patriotism 
          that helped breed, in Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;a peasantry of heroes.&rdquo;&nbsp;

        The uniquely nationalist sentiment 
        of the English soldier dates back long into the past. To quote historian 
        Linda Colley: &ldquo;a popular 
        sense of Englishness &hellip; considerably predates the French Revolution.&rdquo; 
        An Italian visitor to England 
        in 1548 described his hosts thus: &ldquo;the 
        English are commonly destitute of good breeding, and are despisers of 
        foreigners, since they esteem him a wretched being and but half a man 
        who may be born elsewhere than in Britain.&rdquo; This 
        was true not only of the aristocracy but of the common people as well. 
        It was especially true of bowmen. They were of peasant stock but, in the 
        words of the 15th century jurist, Sir John Fortescue, who fought at their 
        side, they were the men whom &ldquo;the 
        might of the realm of England standyth upon.&rdquo; 
        <p>The English archers of the 
          Middle Ages left no memoirs about their contempt for foreigners, but 
          their successors in Wellington&rsquo;s time did. 
        <p>Here is Private William 
          Wheeler of the 51st Light Infantry on Britain&rsquo;s allies during the Peninsular 
          War (1808-1814): 
        <blockquote>&ldquo;What an ignorant, 
          superstitious, priest-ridden, dirty, lousy set of poor devils are the 
          Portuguese. Without seeing them it is impossible to conceive there exists 
          a people in Europe so debased. The filthiest pigsty is a palace to the 
          filthy houses in this dirty stinking city [Lisbon], all the dirt made 
          in the houses is thrown into the streets, where it remains baking until 
          a storm of rain washes it away. The streets are crowded with half-starved 
          dogs, fat Priests and lousy people. The dogs should all be destroyed, 
          the able-bodied Priests drafted into the Army, half the remainder should 
          be made to keep the city clean, and the remainder if they did not inculcate 
          the necessity of personal cleanliness should be hanged.&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p>Sgt. John Cooper of the 
        7th Fusiliers was no more complimentary about Spaniards: &ldquo;The 
        lower orders of this nation are dirty in their persons, filthy in their 
        habits, obscene in their language, and vindictive in their tempers. Their 
        houses are intolerably smoky and vermin abound.&rdquo; 
        <p>Observations such as these 
          are to be found throughout soldiers&rsquo; memoirs. About the military prowess 
          of their Iberian allies, Sgt. William Lawrence of the 40th wrote: &ldquo;the 
          smell of powder often seemed to cause them to be missing when wanted.&rdquo; 
          Sgt. William Surtees of the 95th Rifles recalled the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s 
          jest about a Spanish division fleeing the field from the Battle of Toulouse 
          in 1814; Wellington &ldquo;wondered whether the Pyrenees would bring them 
          up again, they seemed to have got such a fright.&rdquo; Surtees asserted that 
          the Duke &ldquo;did not indeed depend on their valour, or he would have made 
          a bad winding up of his Peninsular campaign.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
        <p>On first viewing a Spanish 
          army, Sgt. Andrew Pearson of the 61st recalled: &ldquo;Falstaff&rsquo;s ragged regiment 
          would have done honour to any force compared to the men before us.&rdquo; 
          Surtees described the Spanish officer corps thus:&nbsp; 
        <p>
        <blockquote> &ldquo;In short, they 
          had all the pride, arrogance, and self-sufficiency of the best officers 
          in the world, with the very least of all pretensions to have an high 
          opinion of themselves; it is true they were not all alike, but the majority 
          of them were the most haughty, and at the same time most contemptible 
          creatures in the shape of officers, that I ever beheld.&rdquo; </blockquote>
        <p>The British had an entirely 
          different view of their own superiors. Rifleman John Harris of the 95th 
          wrote this of his Brigadier, William Beresford: 
        <p>
        <blockquote> &ldquo;He was equal 
          to his business, too, I would say; and he amongst others of our generals, 
          often made me think that the French army had nothing to show in the 
          shape of officers who could at all compare to ours. There was a noble 
          bearing in our leaders, which they, on the French side (as far as I 
          was capable of observing) had not; &hellip; They are a strange set, the 
          English! and so determined and unconquerable, that they will have their 
          way if they can. Indeed, it requires one who has authority in his face, 
          as well as at his back, to make them respect and obey him.&rdquo; </blockquote>
        <p>Harris frankly believed 
          that the British aristocracy produced the finest leaders of men in the 
          world. 
        <p>Britain was very much a 
          class society, but in battle the shared characteristics of courage, 
          stoicism and perseverance united all. Thomas Howell, of the 71st Highlanders, 
          was a man of some gentility, who joined the army as a private as a result 
          of financial disaster. He had a difficult time adjusting to life among 
          men of a lower class. However, he left this moving account of his rough-hewn 
          comrades during his first battle with the French: 
        <p>
        <blockquote> &ldquo;In our first 
          charge I felt my mind waver, a breathless sensation came over me. The 
          silence was appalling. I looked alongst the line. It was enough to assure 
          me. The steady, determined scowl of my companions assured my heart and 
          gave me determination. How unlike the noisy advance of the French!&rdquo; 
          </blockquote>
        <p>During the Peninsular War, 
          the British had a far higher regard for their enemy than for their allies. 
          They regarded the French as brave, if erratic, soldiers and generally 
          chivalrous. One of the few really negative descriptions comes from Sgt. 
          Edward Costello of the 95th Rifles, and it is a condemnation of only 
          a specific group of men rather than of the French nation. It casts light 
          on those qualities that either impressed or revolted British soldiers.&nbsp; 
        <p>After the capture of Ciudad 
          Rodrigo in 1812, some French prisoners were present at the interment 
          of British dead: 
        <p>
        <blockquote> &ldquo;One more careless 
          than the rest viewed the occurrence with a kind of malicious sneer, 
          which so enraged our men that one of them, taking the little tawny-looking 
          Italian by the nape of his neck, kicked his hind-quarters soundly for 
          it. I could not, at the time, help remarking the very under-sized appearance 
          of the Frenchmen. They were the ugliest set I ever saw, and seemed to 
          be the refuse of their army, and looked more like Italians than Frenchmen.&rdquo; 
          </blockquote>
        <p>Wellington&rsquo;s men had a stoic 
          pride that, in their minds, set them apart from men of any other nationality. 
          A remarkable incident was recorded by Sgt. Edward Costello when he was 
          recovering from a wound received at the Battle of Salamanca in July 
          1812. His hospital ward was under the charge of a fellow Irishman, Sgt. 
          Michael Connelly: 
        <p>
        <blockquote> &ldquo;Mike was exceedingly 
          attentive to the sick, and particularly anxious that the British soldier, 
          when dying, should hold out a pattern of firmness to the Frenchmen who 
          lay intermixed with us in the same wards. &lsquo;Hould your tongue, ye blathering 
          devil,&rsquo; he would say in a low tone, &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t be after disgracing your 
          country in the teeth of these ere furriners, by dying hard. Ye&rsquo;ll have 
          company at your burial, won&rsquo;t you? Ye&rsquo;ll have the drums beating and 
          the guns firing over ye, won&rsquo;t ye? &hellip; For God&rsquo;s sake, die like a 
          man before these &lsquo;ere Frenchers.&rsquo; &rdquo; </blockquote>
        <p>After Waterloo, Costello 
          again found himself in hospital, this time in Brussels, and recorded 
          something even more remarkable: 
        <p>
        <blockquote> &ldquo;I remained in 
          Brussels three days, and had ample means here, as in several other places, 
          such as Salamanca, &c., for witnessing the cutting off of legs and 
          arms. The French I have ever found to be brave, yet I cannot say they 
          will undergo a surgical operation with the cool, unflinching spirit 
          of a British soldier. An incident which came under my notice may in 
          some measure show the differences of the two nations. An English soldier 
          belonging to, if I recollect rightly, the 1st Royal Dragoons, evidently 
          an old weather-beaten warfarer, while undergoing the amputation of an 
          arm below the elbow, held the injured limb in his other hand without 
          betraying the slightest emotion, save occasionally helping out his pain 
          by spirting forth the proceeds of a large plug of tobacco, which he 
          chewed most unmercifully while under the operation. Near to him was 
          a Frenchman, bellowing lustily, while a surgeon was probing for a ball 
          near the shoulder. This seemed to annoy the Englishman more than anything 
          else, and so much so, that as soon as his arm was amputated, he struck 
          the Frenchman a smart blow across the breech with the severed limb, 
          holding it at the wrist, saying, &lsquo;Here, take that, and stuff it down 
          your throat, and stop your damn bellowing!</blockquote>
        <p><font size="+1">The Colonial 
          Campaigns </font>
        <p>Warfare against non-Europeans 
          inspired a far greater sense of distance and alienness. John Shipp of 
          the 87th, the only man of his era to win two commissions from the ranks, 
          wrote of battle against the &ldquo;Caffres&rdquo; of South Africa:

        <blockquote>&ldquo;At every farmhouse 
          in our line of march we found appalling scenes of murder and desolation. 
          Whole families had been massacred by these wild people, whose devastations 
          it was now our duty to check. So ignorant were they, that I am convinced 
          they were unaware that murder is a crime&hellip; . The savage Caffre exults 
          in these appalling sights. To his bestial mind the groans of the wounded, 
          and the dying, are the greatest of pleasures. When the frenzy of the 
          attack is on him he is wrought up to ecstasy, dancing and jumping about, 
          and hauling spears at man or beast with reckless abandon&hellip; . I have 
          seen them with [murdered] women&rsquo;s gowns, petticoats, shawls and things 
          tied round their legs and between their toes, capering about the woods 
          in a frenzy of delight.&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p>Sgt. George Calladine of the 
        19th recalled his first encounter with Africans: &ldquo;I certainly saw little 
        naked children running about which, if I had seen nothing of them but 
        their faces, I should have taken them for monkeys.&rdquo; Sgt. Pearson wrote 
        of the &ldquo;Caffres&rdquo; with more sympathy, marveling at their physiques: &ldquo;six 
        feet six inches to seven feet, with most symmetrical figures.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
        <p>William Richardson was a 
          common seamen who served in the Royal Navy between 1793 and 1819. Before 
          being impressed into the Navy he served on several merchant vessels, 
          including a slaver. He recorded his impressions of the trade: 
        <blockquote>&ldquo;Some people in 
          England think that we hunt and catch the slaves ourselves, but this 
          is a mistaken idea, for we get them by barter as follows: their petty 
          kings and traders get them not so much by wars (as is imagined) as by 
          trade and treachery, and when they get a number for sale bring them 
          to the coast and sell them&hellip; . There was one of their petty kings 
          who, when he came on board, would strut along the deck as if he had 
          been one of the greatest men in the world: he was a little fat fellow 
          dressed in a suit of coarse blue cloth edged with something like yellow 
          worsted, but what spoiled all was that he had no shirt, shoes or stockings 
          on, and his naked black feet and legs being dabbed over with mud and 
          salt water, made him a laughingstock to the sailors; but did not put 
          him out of conceit of himself.&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p>Colonial wars were not confined 
        to Africa. Thomas Howell of the 71st Highlanders recorded his none too 
        flattering impressions of the Indians of Montevideo: 
        <blockquote>&ldquo;The native women 
          were the most uncomely I ever beheld. They have broad noses, thick lips, 
          and are of very small stature. Their hair, which is long, black and 
          hard to the feel, they wear frizzled up in front in the most hideous 
          manner, while it hangs down their backs below the waist. When they dress 
          they stick in it feathers and flowers, and walk about in all the pride 
          of ugliness. The men &hellip; are brave, but indolent to excess&hellip; . 
          As for their idleness, I have seen them lie stretched, for a whole day, 
          gazing upon the river, and their wives bring them their victuals; and 
          if they were not pleased with the quantity, they would beat them furiously. 
          This is the only exertion they make willingly – venting their fury upon 
          their wives.&rdquo;</blockquote>
       <p>These remarks concerning the 
        physical characteristics of Africans and Indians (not to mention Latins) 
        point to the British soldier&rsquo;s racial consciousness as part of his patriotism. 
        This is not to say that the British soldier loathed non-European foes 
        because of race; it was because of the latter&rsquo;s savagery. Sgt. James Thompson 
        served with the 78th Highlanders at Quebec in 1759, during one of the 
        North American campaigns of the Seven Years War. He witnessed the repulse 
        of a British attack on the Ile d&rsquo;Orleans: &ldquo;When 
        the French saw us far enough on the retreat, they sent their savages to 
        scalp and tomahawk our poor fellows that lay wounded on the beach.&rdquo; 
        <p>During the War of 1812, 
          British troops this time found themselves allied to Indians. Historian 
          Donald Graves describes an event that took place after the Battle of 
          Lundy&rsquo;s Lane in 1814: &ldquo;Sergeant 
          Commins of the 8th and Private Byfield of the 41st watched with horror 
          as an Indian &lsquo;busy in plundering came to an American that had been severely 
          wounded and not being able to get the man&rsquo;s boots off threw him into 
          the fire.&rsquo; A nearby British regular &lsquo;filled with indignation for such 
          barbarity shot the Indian and threw him onto the fire to suffer for 
          his unprincipled villainy.&rsquo; &rdquo; <br>

        <p>Sgt. William Lawrence of 
          the 40th described a grisly encounter with Indians near Buenos Aires 
          in 1807. A corporal and a private were killed while destroying native 
          huts: &ldquo;This was a 
          great glory to the natives; they stuck the corporal&rsquo;s head on a pole 
          and carried it in front of their little band on the march.&rdquo; Later: &ldquo;As 
          we marched along on our next day&rsquo;s journey, about two hundred Indians 
          kept following us, the foremost of them wearing our dead corporal&rsquo;s 
          jacket, and carrying his head – I do not know for what reason, but perhaps 
          they thought a good deal more of a dead man&rsquo;s head than we should feel 
          disposed to do.&rdquo; 
        <p>Later the 200 Indians attacked 
          Lawrence&rsquo;s party of 20 infantrymen and were easily repulsed, they &ldquo;not 
          liking the smell and much less the taste of our gunpowder.&rdquo; The Indian 
          chief who carried the corporal&rsquo;s head was wounded and captured by the 
          British. He was not killed out of hand but was treated according to 
          civilized custom and left with friendly Indians to be nursed back to 
          health. 
        <p>It did not take long for 
          non-Europeans to discover and profit from the differences between British 
          and native warfare. Sir Evelyn Wood writes of interrogating Zulu prisoners 
          in 1879 after the battle of Kambula: 
        <blockquote>&ldquo;When I had obtained 
          all the information I required I said, &lsquo;Before Isandwhlana [an 1879 
          battle in which a Zulu army of 20,000 routed and massacred 800 encamped 
          British infantry] we treated all your wounded men in our hospital. But 
          when you attacked our camp your brethren, our black patients, rose and 
          helped to kill those who had been attending on them. Can any of you 
          advance any reason why I should not kill you?&rsquo; One of the younger men, 
          with an intelligent face, asked, &lsquo;May I speak?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;There is a very 
          good reason why you should not kill us. We kill you because it is the 
          custom of the black men [to kill prisoners]. But it isn&rsquo;t the white 
          man&rsquo;s custom.&rsquo; &rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p>The Englishman reportedly had 
        no answer to this, and the blacks were later freed. 
        <p>When it came to actual warfare 
          against non-white armies, the popular conception is of an unfair contest 
          with European colonial troops discharging advanced weaponry on natives 
          armed with sticks and clubs. The truth was often quite different. In 
          discussing Wellington&rsquo;s great victory over a Mahratta (Indian) army 
          six times the size of his own at Assaye in 1803, historian Jeremy Black 
          points out that &ldquo;success owed much to a bayonet charge, scarcely conforming 
          to the standard image of Western armies gunning down masses of non-European 
          troops relying on cold steel.&rdquo; This contemporary historian refrains 
          from analyzing how that small red-coated force achieved its moral triumph, 
          and certainly does not discuss any patriotic or racialist motivations 
          it may have possessed. The British commander knew better. 
        <p>The Duke of Wellington is 
          notorious for describing his infantry as the &ldquo;scum of the earth.&rdquo; Yet 
          this was most of all a description of their social class and their vices 
          (drink above all). In battle, the British soldier was &ldquo;the item upon 
          which victory depends.&rdquo; On his return from India in 1804, Wellington 
          wrote a memorandum in which he offered an explanation for the incredible 
          achievements of the British, especially in India. It should be studied 
          by all military &ldquo;experts&rdquo; who would deride the importance of national 
          (and racial) feeling among soldiers:&nbsp; 
        <blockquote>&ldquo;The English soldiers 
          are the main foundation of the British power in Asia. They are a body 
          with habits, manners and qualities peculiar to them in the East Indies. 
          Bravery is the characteristic of the British army in all quarters of 
          the world; but no other quarter has afforded such striking examples 
          of the existence of this quality in the soldiers as the East Indies. 
          An instance of their misbehavior in the field has never been known; 
          and particularly those who have been for some time in that country cannot 
          be ordered upon any service, however dangerous or arduous, that they 
          will not effect, not only with bravery, but a degree of skill not often 
          witnessed in persons of their description in other parts of the world. 
          I attribute these qualities, which are peculiar to them in the East 
          Indies, to the distinctness of their class in that country from all 
          others existing in it. They feel they are a distinct and superior class 
          to the rest of the world which surrounds them; and their actions correspond 
          with their high notions of their own superiority&hellip; . Their weaknesses 
          and vices, however repugnant to the feelings and prejudices of the Natives, 
          are passed over in the contemplation of their excellent qualities as 
          soldiers, of which no nation has hitherto given such extraordinary instances. 
          These qualities are the foundation of the British strength in Asia, 
          and of that opinion by which it is generally supposed that the British 
          empire has been gained and upheld. These qualities show in what manner 
          nations, consisting of millions, are governed by 30,000 strangers . 
          &hellip;&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p>
          Thus it was through a sense of national superiority, of the white Briton 
          as a being apart, that the British Empire was won and held. Years later, 
          Wellington would state plainly (in a parliamentary debate on Asian Indian 
          participation in the higher levels of the Civil Service):&nbsp; 
          &ldquo;That the white man has an 
          influence [of a moral kind] which the black man has not.&rdquo; Wellington 
          would scarcely have been able to credit the notion that one day British 
          governments would discourage racial feelings among their soldiers. He 
          praised the racial arrangements in the Southern United States, and considered 
          them essential if America&rsquo;s liberal system of government was to survive. 
        <p>An understanding of the 
          role of race has not entirely died among the British. A ranker (a soldier 
          holding a rank other than that of officer) of the Second World War has 
          left us with an analysis of the motivations of his comrades in Burma. 
          George MacDonald Fraser&rsquo;s bluntly honest account (put to paper in 1992) 
          should ring as a battle cry for anyone interested in his own nation&rsquo;s 
          defense: 
        <p>
        <blockquote> &ldquo;There is much 
          talk today of guilt as an aftermath of wars – guilt over killing the 
          enemy, and even guilt for surviving. Much depends on the circumstances, 
          but I doubt if many of the Fourteenth Army lose much sleep over dead 
          Japanese. For one thing they were a no-surrender enemy and if we hadn&rsquo;t 
          killed them they would surely have killed us. But there was more to 
          it than that. It may appall a generation who have been dragooned into 
          considering racism the ultimate crime, but I believe there was a feeling 
          (there was in me) that the Jap was farther down the human scale than 
          the European. It is a feeling that I see reflected today in institutions 
          and people who would deny hotly that they are subconscious racists – 
          the presence of TV cameras ensured a superficial concern for the Kurdish 
          refugees and Bangladeshi flood victims, but we all know that the Western 
          reaction would have been immeasurably greater if a similar disaster 
          had occurred in Australia or Canada or Europe; some people seem to count 
          more than others, with liberals as well as reactionaries, and it is 
          folly to feel that racial kinship and likeness are not at the bottom 
          of it.&rdquo; </blockquote>
        <p>A measured statement such 
          as this would not be tolerated in America, and this bodes ill for the 
          future, especially the future of our armed forces. As long as the basic 
          principle of racial kinship is denied by our leaders, America&rsquo;s very 
          existence will be in peril. There can be no stability in a society which 
          will not allow its members to favor their own brethren. An army that 
          will deny its soldiers this right is an army on the road to defeat.
