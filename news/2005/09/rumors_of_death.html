<h1>Rumors of Deaths Greatly Exaggerated</h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Thevenot and Gordon Russell, New Orleans Times-Picayune, Sept. 26</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After five days managing near-riots, medical horrors and unspeakable living conditions inside the Superdome, Louisiana National Guard Col. Thomas Beron prepared to hand over the dead to representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>Following days of internationally reported killings, rapes and gang violence inside the Dome, the doctor from FEMA &mdash; Beron doesn&rsquo;t remember his name &mdash; came prepared for a grisly scene: He brought a refrigerated 18-wheeler and three doctors to process bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a report of 200 bodies in the Dome,&rdquo; Beron recalls the doctor saying.</p>
<p>The real total was six, Beron said.</p>
<p>Of those, four died of natural causes, one overdosed and another jumped to his death in an apparent suicide, said Beron, who personally oversaw the turning over of bodies from a Dome freezer, where they lay atop melting bags of ice. State health department officials in charge of body recovery put the official death count at the Dome at 10, but Beron said the other four bodies were found in the street near the Dome, not inside it. Both sources said no one had been killed inside.</p>
<p>At the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, just four bodies were recovered, despites reports of corpses piled inside the building. Only one of the dead appeared to have been slain, said health and law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>That the nation&rsquo;s front-line emergency management believed the body count would resemble that of a bloody battle in a war is but one of scores of examples of myths about the Dome and the Convention Center treated as fact by evacuees, the media and even some of New Orleans&rsquo; top officials, including the mayor and police superintendent. As the fog of warlike conditions in Hurricane Katrina&rsquo;s aftermath has cleared, the vast majority of reported atrocities committed by evacuees have turned out to be false, or at least unsupported by any evidence, according to key military, law enforcement, medical and civilian officials in positions to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think 99 percent of it is bulls &mdash;,&rdquo; said Sgt. 1st Class Jason Lachney, who played a key role in security and humanitarian work inside the Dome. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, bad things happened, but I didn&rsquo;t see any killing and raping and cutting of throats or anything&hellip; .   Ninety-nine percent of the people in the Dome were very well-behaved.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Dr. Louis Cataldie, the state Health and Human Services Department administrator overseeing the body recovery operation, said his teams were inundated with false reports about the Dome and Convention Center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We swept both buildings several times, because we kept getting reports of more bodies there,&rdquo; Cataldie said. &ldquo;But it just wasn&rsquo;t the case.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One widely circulated tale, told to The Times-Picayune by a slew of evacuees and two Arkansas National Guardsmen, held that &ldquo;30 or 40 bodies&rdquo; were stored in a Convention Center freezer. But a formal Arkansas Guard review of the matter later found that no soldier had actually seen the corpses, and that the information came from rumors in the food line for military, police and rescue workers in front of Harrah&rsquo;s New Orleans Casino, said Edwards, who conducted the review.</p>
