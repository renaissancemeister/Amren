<h1><a href="https://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,16601391-1702,00.html">Legal Threat Over Racist Article</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AAP, Sept. 14</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A lawyer for Australia&rsquo;s Sudanese community has threatened a Victorian university with legal action if it publishes an article by a controversial Sydney-based law professor.</p>
<p>Called &lsquo;Rethinking the White Australia Policy?, the 6,800-word article was written by Associate Professor Andrew Fraser, who&rsquo;s been banned from teaching at Sydney&rsquo;s Macquarie University after making racist remarks. </p>
<p>The Canadian-born academic wrote a letter to his local suburban newspaper in July, claiming Australia was becoming a Third World colony by allowing non-white immigration. </p>
<p>He claimed Africans had low IQs and that their migration increased crime. </p>
<p>Prof Fraser said &ldquo;a rising ruling class of Asians&rdquo; threatened the social, political and economic interests of &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; Australians, and he also publicly supported an anti-refugee campaign by neo-Nazi group White Pride Coalition. </p>
<p>Lawyer George Newhouse today warned Deakin University to scrap plans to publish Prof Fraser&rsquo;s contentious views in its next law journal. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am shocked that a university would even want to publish something along these lines,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I put the university on notice that if they repeat the racial vilification, a claim for compensation may be made against the university and the editors that publish or republish this poison.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr Newhouse said he had already commenced proceedings on behalf of the Sudanese Darfurian community in the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In respect of Mr Fraser&rsquo;s racial vilification surely it is not appropriate to publish his slander whilst proceedings are on foot,&rdquo; Mr Newhouse said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If the journal persists in publishing racial vilification they would be joining in the racial vilification.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A spokesperson from Deakin University said there were no plans to scrap the article. </p>
<p>&ldquo;At this stage it is one of the articles that will be included the October edition,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Prof Fraser&rsquo;s work was assessed by two respected academics before it was accepted, the spokesman said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the law journal is a legal publication of some standing, the articles are peer reviewed,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They might not agree or disagree with the content, but they see this work as a considered position of some academic standing.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But Mr Newhouse said the work promoted racism and intolerance. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not about academic freedom, it goes to the heart of the right of all Australians to live together in peace and harmony,&rdquo; he said.</p>
