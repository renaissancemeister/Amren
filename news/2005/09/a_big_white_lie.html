<h1><a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/orl-whiteblack05sep18,0,5319055.story?page=1&amp;track=mostemailedlink">A Big White Lie</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Kunerth, Orlando Sentinel, Sept. 18</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Every family has its secrets. There are things parents never tell children. There are lies that become family legend. There are stories that were never meant to be told.</p>
<p>Judith Hartmann&rsquo;s secret, when she married Bill Myers in 1959, was that she was pregnant by a black man.</p>
<p>When the baby born to two white parents came out black, the secret became a lie.</p>
<p>Throughout his childhood, David Myers was told that his skin color was a disease called melanism. He was lucky, his mother said, because the skin discoloration was all over his body, instead of just splotches of brown like most people had.</p>
<p>So despite his dark skin, Myers grew up in white, middle-class neighborhoods in Ohio and New York believing he was white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For many years I thought I was white. I thought like a white kid. There was a feeling in me that I didn&rsquo;t want to be associated with blacks. I wanted the story to be true,&rdquo; says Myers, a 45-year-old Orlando tennis teacher.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As much as family members acted as though Dave was just like the other kids, they knew he wasn&rsquo;t. And the difference started showing up in his behavior.</p>
<p>As Dave Myers entered adolescence, the trouble started. He became defiant, hostile and sometimes threatening.</p>
<p>At one point, Myers was sent to live with a foster family. Another time, he was kicked out of the house and lived in his car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the black sheep of the family &mdash; literally and figuratively,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I was always in the doghouse or always getting out of the doghouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Dave was treated differently, it was because of his behavior, not his skin color, his mother says. &ldquo;He was just uncontrollable. None of my other children acted this way,&rdquo; Judy says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But if shedding the skin-disease story liberated Judith Myers, it plunged David Myers into an identity crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my mother told me the truth, I went through a period of being homeless &mdash; three years,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>He was a black man who knew nothing about being black. His family wasn&rsquo;t black. None of his neighbors had been black. None of his classmates had been black. Few of his friends were black.</p>
<p>Myers embarked on a self-education about all the things he never learned about black history, black culture, and race relations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After years of trying on different identities, Myers now believes he knows who he is and what he needs to do. He is the product of a black man and a white woman who must tell his story &mdash; and his family&rsquo;s secrets &mdash; so that blacks and whites can better understand each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that people can learn from my experience,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>So Myers has started his own Web site &mdash; discuss race.com &mdash; that features &ldquo;The Dave Myers Story&rdquo; and a list of books he has read.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His parents and sister complain that they cannot have a normal relationship with Myers. Every family gathering, every conversation, leads to a past they have no interest in reliving. He wants them to face the truth; they want to eat chicken supper without guilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always has to get into racial discussions or the &lsquo;poor me&rsquo; discussions,&rdquo; says Bill Myers. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t accept the way things are and go forward with his life. He has to keep stirring up the dirty water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave&rsquo;s contention that racism is responsible for the problems in his life, his mother says, has made her more prejudiced against blacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has with his actions totally soured me on the black race,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dave Myers stands alone in the community room of the Southwest Public Library in the Dr. Phillips area with his three tables of books on race.</p>
<p>Dressed in a white shirt, tie, striped suspenders and dark slacks, Myers leans against a table, waiting for the crowd to arrive.</p>
<p>For weeks, he posted fliers on &ldquo;The Race Myth &hellip; debunked.&rdquo; The fliers identify him as &ldquo;Dave Myers &mdash; Subject Matter Expert&rdquo; and direct people to his Web site.</p>
<p>But nearly two hours after the doors open at 10 a.m., nobody has arrived. Even the person he hired to set up audiovisual equipment hasn&rsquo;t shown up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
