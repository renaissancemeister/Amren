<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Monday morning&rsquo;s massive power failure has hit businesses, disrupted traffic and left irate residents calling for action.</p>
<p>Sol Mosolo, spokesperson for City Power, said the cause was a problem with the 88kV line that supplied the north-east areas of Johannesburg.</p>
<p>He declined to say where exactly the fault was, or describe in further detail what had gone wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have sent our technical team out and they are working on repairing the line. We were able to restore a portion of Rosebank with electricity at 5am this morning,&rdquo; Mosolo said, appealing to residents to &ldquo;bear with us&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mosolo said all power would hopefully be restored &ldquo;by the end of the day&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In March this year Brian Hlongwa, the member of the mayoral committee in charge of utilities, vowed to resign if the problem of power outages wasn&rsquo;t resolved.</p>
<p>By March, there had been 775 power cuts in Johannesburg over eight months. Five months later, there are still problems.</p>
<p>Hlongwa also promised that City Power&rsquo;s chief executive, Mogwailane Mohlala, would be fired and other heads would roll as proof of how seriously the city viewed outages.</p>
<p>Hlongwa announced in March that the city was allocating R674-million for the upgrading of infrastructure for the 2005/06 financial year, starting in July.</p>
<p>Mike Moriarty, Johannesburg&rsquo;s Democratic Alliance leader, said it was a &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo; that such an outage was allowed to happen and that there were no alternative power feeds available.</p>
<p>&ldquo;City Power never appears to have back-up plans in place and this is leading to chaos in the city,&rdquo; Moriarty said.</p>
<p>Power outages had reduced extensively compared with last year&rsquo;s figures, Mosolo said.</p>
<p>But Moriarty pointed out that this winter had been mild compared with last year&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>Mosolo could not comment on the resignation of Brian Hlongwa or the firing of Mohlala. Hlongwa was unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Killarney Mall tenants were among those left in the dark on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Mugg and Bean general manager Chris Vienings said he was furious, as his business was losing up to R2 000 per hour.</p>
<p>He also said this was at least the 30th power cut the shop had experienced in the past five years. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I despise this,&rdquo; he said angrily. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re just waiting in the dark. Usually by now the whole restaurant would be full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vienings said that despite the power cuts they were forced to pay rent as normal. </p>
<p>Vienings said City Power should manage the problem better.</p>
<p>Nearby, the Wimpy was also in the dark, with customers sitting at tables lit by candle light.</p>
<p>Customers Thembi Khumalo had come in to escape the chilly morning. She works at the Standard Bank and had been looking forward to her morning cup of coffee.</p>
<p>But Wimpy&rsquo;s manager Bennet Mampa said the restaurant had not had any power since they opened at 7am.</p>
<p>Next door, a dark and empty Juicy Lucy was also missing out on the morning rush and waiters sat around a table chatting.</p>
<p>Mohamed Seedat, owner of the Steers in Kensington, said he had lost around R700 an hour on Monday morning because of the power outage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have so many customers here and I cannot even serve them a cup of tea &hellip;  I just hope they restore the electricity for the lunchtime rush,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>On the roads, metro police officers battled to keep the rush hour traffic flowing smoothly and were controlling many of the intersections along Oxford Road.</p>
<p>Traffic was backed up and dead robot intersections became slow-moving four-way stops but no serious accidents were reported, Metro police spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said.</p>
