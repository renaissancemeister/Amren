<h1>Bills Seeking Reparations, Limiting Foreclosures Clear Hurdles</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Lawrence, AP, Sept. 7</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Responding to a dark, little-known chapter in American history, the Assembly voted to establish a state fund that could be used to pay reparations to survivors of a massive deportation of Hispanics in the 1930s.</p>
<p>By a 41-23 vote Tuesday, lawmakers approved a bill by Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, that also would create a 16-member commission to make recommendations to the governor and Legislature on how to redress the deportations.</p>
<p>It would take subsequent legislation to appropriate money for the fund, however.</p>
<p>The bill is a response to a policy that was started by the Hoover administration, supposedly in an attempt to remove illegal immigrants to open up jobs during the Depression.</p>
<p>But most of the 2 million people who were deported to Mexico were American citizens or legal immigrants, bill supporters say. They included about 400,000 Californians.</p>
<p>Some of the deportees eventually returned to the United States. Less than 5,000 of them now live in California, said Assemblywoman Cindy Montanez, D-San Fernando.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is the time for California to acknowledge this illegal program that stripped Americans of their basic civil rights,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Assemblyman Lloyd Levine, D-Sherman Oaks, compared the bill to federal legislation that authorized reparation payments to Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were removed from your house and land and sent away .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and your descendants were deprived of their rights to inherit that land, you would be demanding reparations,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But Assemblyman Ray Haynes, R-Murrieta, said the Legislature should stop worrying about rectifying past wrongs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will there be a time in this country when we stop worrying about what occurred and say what&rsquo;s done is done?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The bill goes back to the Senate for a vote on Assembly amendments.</p>
