<div align="left"><i>William Robertson Boggs, American Renaissance, June 1992</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>Los Angeles is now quiet after the most destructive and murderous riots
this country has seen in more than a century. In just three days in early
May, rioters burned more than 5,300 buildings and caused the deaths of
58 people. More than 2,300 people were injured  &mdash;  227 of them critically
 &mdash;  and property damage was estimated at more than $750 million. [The toll,
<i>LA
Times</i>, May 7, 1992, p. A6.]&nbsp;
<p>The destruction was carried out mainly by blacks, who were said to be
outraged by the &#8220;racist&#8221; beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers
and by their &#8220;racist&#8221; acquittal on charges of criminal assault. Among the
dead and injured were an unknown number of whites who were savaged by mobs
of blacks simply because they were white.&nbsp;
<p>The entire eruption of violence  &mdash;  which included smaller-scale outbreaks
in San Francisco, Las Vegas, Atlanta, and many other cities [Violence continues
across U.S.  &mdash;  troops called out in Vegas, <i>SF Chronicle</i>, May 2, 1991,
p. A9.]  &mdash;  can be traced directly to the reckless way the media handled
the Rodney King incident from the start. Now that the trial is over, and
the facts in the case are clear, the media&rsquo;s behavior can be seen in all
its astonishing irresponsibility.&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="arial">Rodney King, &#8216;Black Motorist&rsquo;</font></b>
<p>Rodney King is a convicted felon with a long criminal record. On March
3, 1991, he was out of jail on parole, and driving recklessly and at great
speed through residential streets of Los Angeles. It was later determined
that he was blind drunk  &mdash;  there was 2&frac12; times the legal limit of
alcohol in his blood, and there was marijuana in his system  &mdash;  and his driving
showed it.&nbsp;
<p>When he was finally forced to a stop, police ordered him out of the
car for fear a weapon might be hidden in it. Mr. King refused, and was
pulled out. He would not let himself be frisked, spat at the police, made
obscene threats to a policewoman, laughed maniacally, and danced about
when told to stand still. Mr. King is six feet three inches tall, weighs
250 pounds, and was acting dangerously crazy. [Don Feder, Blacks again
are the victims of years of racial demagogy, <i>Orange County Register</i>,
May 3, 1992, p. K1. How the defense dissected the tape, <i>Newsweek</i>,
May 11, 1992, p. 36.] He refused to lie face-down on the ground so that
police could safely handcuff him. The police quite properly decided to
force him down.&nbsp;
<p>Their first attempt was with a 50,000-volt electronic stun gun. One
shot of this device will knock a person down 80 to 90 percent of the time.
The officers hit Mr. King twice with the gun and it had no effect. They
began to think that he was on PCP, a drug that can cause psychotic behavior.
They later testified that they were afraid Mr. King would attack them and
try to wrest a gun away from them. [Linda Deutsch, Jury believed police
had right to use plenty of force, <i>Orange County Register</i>, April
30, 1992, p. A4. Sheryl Stolberg, Jurors tell of angry, bitter deliberations,
<i>LA
Times</i>, May 8, 1992, p. A3.] The best way to take Mr. King down would
have been with a choke hold, but the city of Los Angeles banned choke holds
in 1982. (A few drug users had died from the hold, but that may have been
as much because of drugs as because of the hold.) [Greg Meyer, We must
have a way to safely take a suspect down, <i>SJ Mercury News</i>, May 3,
1992, p. 1.]&nbsp;
<p>Since the stun gun had failed, the only way to tackle Mr. King was with
night sticks, and the police clubbed him repeatedly. [Murray Rothbard,
Rockwell vs. Rodney and the Libertarian world, <i>Rothbard Rockwell Report</i>,
July 1991, p. 4. Henry Weinstein, White says jury was the worst possible,
<i>LA
Times</i>, May 8, 1992, p. A3.] Mr. King refused to stay on the ground,
and every time he made a move to get up, he was clubbed again. An amateur
video cameraman recorded the beating, which was later broadcast on television.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

</tr>
</table>
<p>The video is 81 seconds long, and it shows Mr. King resisting arrest
and threatening the police. Virtually all television stations chose to
show only the last part, in which Mr. King was on the ground and was being
pounded in a way that appeared  &mdash;  and may well have been  &mdash;  excessive. A
careful study of the entire tape suggests that the beating stopped when
Mr. King did as he was told and kept still. [How the defense dissected
the tape, <i>Newsweek</i>, May 11, 1992, p. 36.]&nbsp;
<p>Three of the policemen who clubbed Mr. King were white and one was Hispanic.
The media routinely reported that they were all white, and puffed the arrest
up into a major racial incident. Television stations showed the tape so
often that there must be scarcely anyone in America who has not seen it.
As it happens, damage to Mr. King was not great; just a few weeks later,
he was feeling chipper enough to solicit a transvestite prostitute, and
tried to run over a Los Angeles policeman who interrupted the transaction.
[Murray Rothbard, Rockwell vs. Rodney and the Libertarian world, <i>Rothbard
Rockwell Report</i>, July 1991, p. 6.]&nbsp;
<p>What would have been different if Mr. King had been white? For one thing,
the media would have inquired into why he was beaten. If they had given
the story any attention at all, they would have noted a drunk driver&rsquo;s
criminal, threatening behavior.&nbsp;
<p>However, since Mr. King is black, the media had a ready-made explanation
for the beating. &#8220;Racism&#8221; explained it, and the media gave full voice to
the war-cry that means they think they have a sure enough white &#8220;racists&#8221;
in their sights. The media scarcely mentioned what Mr. King had done to
provoke a beating. They ignored the fact that Mr. King had two companions
with him in the car, both of whom were black, both of whom did what the
police told them to do, <i>both of whom were unharmed</i> (though one is
now claiming they were roughed up). [AP, King passenger claims he was beaten,
<i>Las
Vegas Review-Journal</i>, May 5, 1992, p. 5A.] And of course, they turned
a deaf ear when Mr. King himself said he did not think the police beat
him because he was black. [Henry Weinstein, White says jury was the worst
possible, <i>LA Times</i>, May 8, 1992, p. A3.] Thus, the media took what
was, at worst, an ambiguous incident and blew it into a huge case of white
racism.&nbsp;
<p>The policemen were charged with criminal violence and their trial opened
a year after the beating. When the jury then found the officers not guilty,
it was not necessarily saying that Mr. King&rsquo;s arrest was an ideal example
of police work. Four of the jurors held out to convict the most aggressive
officer of assault, and he may be retried on that charge. As for the other
three, the jurors decided that what they did was not <i>criminal</i>. [Paul
Lieberman, Jurors tell of their fear and disbelief, <i>SF Chronicle</i>,
May 1, 1992, p. 1.]&nbsp;

</table>
<p>Of course, the media were so committed to a &#8220;racist&#8221; version of events
that they pronounced themselves shocked at the verdict, and promptly called
the jury &#8220;racist.&#8221; In keeping with their own biases, they regularly referred
to the jurors as &#8220;all-white,&#8221; despite the fact that one was Asian and another
was Hispanic. The jurors explained that they did not think about race,
nor did they believe the police did either. As one said, &#8220;Had the man been
white, had he been &hellip; Oriental &hellip;, had he been anything and acted as Rodney
King did, he would have been given the same treatment.&#8221; [AP, Members: Race
no factor in verdict, <i>Orange County Register</i>, May 1, 1992, p. A11.]
Of course, the media knew better.&nbsp;
<p>The jury heard 29 days of testimony [Richard Serrano, Cops in beating
acquitted on 10 of 11 counts, <i>SF Chronicle</i>, April 30, 1992, p. A1.]
and deliberated for seven days. [Sheryl Stolberg, Jurors tell of angry,
bitter deliberations, <i>LA Times</i>, May 8, 1992, p. A3.] The nation
saw a few seconds of video tape. The nation, whipped up by the media, convinced
itself it knew more than the jury did. From the President on down, nearly
everyone wrung his hands over the horrible injustices of white America.
Thus prompted and excused, black neighborhoods from coast to coast rose
up to loot, burn, and vent anti-white hatred. Thus prompted and excused,
a great many Americans were led to think that the arson and murder of those
three days were somehow the moral equivalent of the beating and the verdict.&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="arial">Selective Racism</font></b>
<p>Although &#8220;racism&#8221; was trumpeted as the great sin that prompted the riots,
the media were remarkably quiet about the many cases of vicious racist
violence by blacks against whites. The best-known was an attack on a truck
driver, Reginald Denny, who was pulled from his tractor trailer by blacks
who beat him mercilessly and smashed his face with a fire extinguisher.
Other blacks ran up to stomp the barely breathing Mr. Denny, and dance
little jigs of glee. Doctors said the man&rsquo;s injuries were like those of
someone who was in a 60-mile-per-hour car crash without seat belts. The
only reason Mr. Denny is well known is that a helicopter TV crew happened
to tape the attack. [Rescued truck driver is recovering, <i>SF Chronicle</i>,
May 4, 1992, p. A6.] From below, blacks fired on the helicopter with pistols
and shotguns. [Ed Pope, L.A. goes back to work, <i>SJ Mercury News</i>,
May 5, 1992, p. 1.]&nbsp;

<p><img src="/news/2005/09/restless.gif" align="CENTER"></center>
<p>Few people heard about Matt Haines, a 32-year-old white man who, with
his nephew, was riding a motorcycle into the black part of Los Angeles
after a black friend called to say that her car would not start. The two
whites were stopped by a gang of about 15 blacks, who knocked them off
the motorcycle and beat them as they lay on the ground. Without provocation,
one of the blacks shot Mr. Haines in the head. His nephew was shot three
times in the arm, but when the gunman held the pistol to his face the weapon
did not fire. Mr. Haines died; his nephew survived. [&#8220;We&rsquo;re on your side,&#8221;
victim told attackers, <i>SJ Mercury News</i>, May 4, 1992, p. 9A.]&nbsp;
<p>Howard Epstein, who was living in northern California, flew to Los Angeles
at the start of the riots to protect his Los Angeles machine shop and its
employees. Three black men shot him as he was driving from the airport.
After his car crashed to a stop, looters stripped him of valuables and
ransacked the car. [Orinda man&rsquo;s fatal decision: trying to protect his
shop, <i>SJ Mercury News</i>, May 4, 1992, p. 9A.]&nbsp;

<p>A gang of blacks smashed the car windows of Jeff Kramer, a white reporter
for the <i>Boston Globe</i>. They tried to drag him out onto the street,
but his seat belt held him in. One youngster then pulled out a gun and
shot him three times. Mr. Kramer had the wit to pretend to be dead, and
this probably saved his life. [Tom Mathews, et al., The siege of L.A.,
<i>Newsweek</i>,
May 11, 1992, p. 34.]&nbsp;
<p>How many of the ten whites  &mdash;  nine men and one woman  &mdash;  who died in the
riot were murdered by black lynch mobs? How many of the injured were, like
the truck driver and the reporter, attacked simply because they were white?
We will never know. No one is counting. The media, which make a national
incident of a dangerous black who is beaten with night sticks, look the
other way when blacks commit unprovoked racial murder. How many dead and
beaten whites would it take before the media worried as much about black
racism as they do about the &#8220;racist&#8221; jury that acquitted the police officers?
Five hundred? One thousand?&nbsp;
<p>Blacks attacked whites in other cities, though they did not manage to
kill any. In Richmond (CA), the white coach of a black girls&rsquo; softball
team was spotted amid shouts of &#8220;There&rsquo;s a white guy.&#8221; He probably would
have been beaten to death if his team had not pleaded for his life. In
the same city, a white water meter reader was clubbed unconscious and woke
up in the hospital in a body cast. A white from West Oakland, who was coming
home from a rally to <i>protest the verdict</i>, was set upon by blacks
and had to have his scalp stapled back together. [Yasmin Anwar, Beating
victims wrong color, wrong place, <i>Oakland Tribune</i>, May 3, 1992,
p. 1.] In San Jose (CA), a 20-year-old black man told a friend he &#8220;was
gonna shoot a white person to get even for Rodney King.&#8221; A few hours later,
he walked up to a couple at a telephone booth and shot both the man and
woman in the head. [Ann O&rsquo;Neill, Racial tension seen in attacks, <i>SJ
Mercury News</i>, May 6, 1992, p. B1.] In Atlanta, blacks beat white reporters,
photographers and passersby. In New York, two drivers were pulled from
their trucks in black neighborhoods; one was beaten and the other was stabbed.
[Violence continues across U.S.  &mdash;  troops called out in Vegas, <i>SF Chronicle</i>,
May 2, 1992, p. A9.]&nbsp;
<p>In Venice (CA), where whites have been moving into a formerly black
neighborhood, mobs attacked the homes of whites and of blacks who were
known to be part of the Neighborhood Watch against crime. At least one
white family&rsquo;s home was looted and burned, and dozens were vandalized.
As one black resident put it, &#8220;It bothers us that people come here building
condos we can&rsquo;t afford. I do know this: Before blacks leave, Venice will
burn.&#8221; [Robin Abcarian, Striking back: What happened in Oakwood was ugly
 &mdash;  but no surprise, <i>LA Times</i>, May 5, 1992, p. E1.]&nbsp;
<p>White people, whom the media like to portray as seething with racism
and hate, appear not to have lifted a finger against blacks. Despite wanton
murder of whites, not a single incident of anti-black violence seems to
have been reported. While whites were being attacked all across the country,
editorialists fretted that the acquittal meant &#8220;open season&#8221; on black men.
It would be hard to think of a more astonishing example of the grotesque
slant the media give to news about race.&nbsp;
<p>In Los Angeles, Korean storekeepers were another racial target. Many
recent immigrants from Korea come with little money and cannot afford to
set up shop anywhere but in the blackest, most dangerous part of town,
where they work 16-hour days. [L.A. Chung, Tensions divide blacks, Asians,
<i>SF
Chronicle</i>, May 4, 1992, p. 1.] Blacks and liberals often complain that
no one &#8220;invests&#8221; in the ghetto, but if anyone has, it is Koreans.&nbsp;
<p>Blacks hate them because they are successful, so looters and arsonists
sought out Korean-owned stores for destruction. In Korea Town, which borders
on black neighborhoods, 80 percent of the businesses were damaged. [Jeff
Pelline, Lasting blow to L.A. neighborhoods, <i>SF Chronicle</i>, May 2,
1992, p. 1.] In all, 1,839 Korean-owned businesses were burned or looted.
[Steven Chin, Innocence lost: L.A.&rsquo;s Koreans fight to be heard, <i>SF Examiner</i>,
May 9, 1992, p. 1.] Even the Korean Consulate came under attack. [AP, Korean
leaders are alarmed at violence in Los Angeles, <i>Oakland Tribune</i>,

<p>The racial hatred that sparked the riot lingered on after calm returned.
Black police officers and National Guardsmen were taunted with cries of
&#8220;What are you doing on <i>their</i> side?&#8221; [Mark Platte, A lot of hostility&#8221;

the words &#8220;Black Owned,&#8221; were painted on them. Fresh graffiti read &#8220;F***
whitey,&#8221; and &#8220;F*** the police.&#8221; [Eyewitness report.]&nbsp;
<p>At the same time, the presence of more than 10,000 soldiers on the streets
brought a feeling of security to a part of town that, even in normal times,
is tense with fear and crackles with gun fire. &#8220;The neighborhood is safe
now,&#8221; said one resident; &#8220;Every six months, they [the National Guard] should
come back and clean the place out.&#8221; [Jim Newton, Under the gun, <i>LA Times</i>,
May 6, 1992, p. A7.]&nbsp;
<p>Did anyone predict that there would be riots if the police officers
were acquitted? Yes; Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates. Just before
the verdict, he set aside $1 million in extra overtime pay in case of an
acquittal. The public reaction? He was a racist to think that blacks might
riot. [Pamela Kramer, Chief Gates returns to his old form, <i>SJ Mercury
News</i>, May 4, 1992, p. 8A.]&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="arial">Rewards for Destruction</font></b>
<p>What will be the result of all this? In the short term, an estimated
20,000 to 40,000 people  &mdash;  mostly black  &mdash;  are suddenly out of work, because
businesses were destroyed. Perhaps 10,000 of those jobs are gone for good.
[Stuart Silverstein, Up to 40,000 out of work after unrest, analysts say,
<i>LA
Times</i>, May 6, 1992, p. A1.] Whole neighborhoods are without the drug
stores, laundromats, gas stations, and grocery stores they depend on.&nbsp;
<p>South-Central Los Angeles had not yet entirely recovered from the Watts
riots. Twenty-seven years later, there are still vacant lots where businesses
once stood. Banks and major retailers had only just begun to trickle back.
[Elliot Smith, Local economy feels the heat, <i>Orange County Register</i>,
May 1, 1992, p. C1.]&nbsp;
<p>Peter Ueberroth has been appointed to oversee the reconstruction of
South-Central Los Angeles. He has gone cap in hand to federal and state
tax payers, but he thinks he can also interest private investors, especially
the Japanese. In what must be one of the most stupid things said so far
about the riots, he proposed that, &#8220;If they [the Japanese] can invest in
Pebble Beach, they should be given the chance to invest in South-Central
Los Angeles.&#8221; [Ed Pope, $1 billion needed to rebuild L.A., Ueberroth says,
<i>SJ
Mercury News</i>, May 4, 1992, p. 8A.]&nbsp;
<p>President George Bush has duly designated Los Angeles a federal disaster
area, so the entire nation will pay for the damage, under a program designed
to help victims of natural disasters. [Ed Torriero, Weary residents beginning
to rebuild L.A., their lives, <i>San Jose Mercury News</i>, May 3, 1992,
p. 1.] Of course, the only disaster that South-Central Los Angeles suffers
from is its own population. First indications were that at least $600 million
in federal money would be made available to the area. [Ed Pope, L.A. goes
back to work, <i>San Jose Mercury News</i>, May 5, 1992, p. 1.] A state
legislator has proposed a new sales tax that would raise another $700 million.
As state and local money is added, it will be edifying to note when the
total outstrips the damage estimates; South-Central Los Angeles is getting
its reward for burning itself down.&nbsp;
<p>President Bush has also promised an intensified federal investigation
into whether the four police officers broke any federal laws by depriving
Mr. King of his civil rights. [Susan Bennett, Bush vows swift action, pleads
for end to unrest, <i>Orange County Register</i>, May 1, 1992, p. A5.]
If there is a federal trial it will be a barely legal case of double jeopardy,
and will hardly be before an impartial jury. How many jurors would be brave
enough to return another verdict like the one that prompted the carnage?&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="arial">More to Come</font></b>
<p>Los Angeles was not the first city to burn, nor will it be the last.
Blacks live in a society in which all evils can be blamed on other people.
No matter how barbaric their behavior, they can count on whites to offer
excuses and foot the bill. Even Asians can be made to talk the same nonsense.
Jai Lee Wong of the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission explains
why Koreans don&rsquo;t get along with blacks: &#8220;Many don&rsquo;t understand racism
and the history of blacks in this country. They see blacks hanging out
drinking on the street corner, children having babies, gangs. But they
don&rsquo;t understand why that exists; that it&rsquo;s not by choice.&#8221; [Charles Hardy,
L.A. race tensions: a picture of fear, <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>, May
10, 1992, p. A1.]&nbsp;
<p>Blacks have no choice but to get drunk on street corners, have illegitimate
babies, and join criminal gangs. To be sure. So long as the Human Relations
Commission thinks this, the only consequence of the Los Angeles riots will
be more programs that coddle the criminal and reward the irresponsible.
Yet more illegitimate children born to squalor, lawlessness, and welfare
will once again burn down whatever their elders manage to rebuild.</font>

<p>Sure keep saying that.</p>
<p>There is a difference between now and then. <span class="caps">THE INTERNET. </span> If the internet was around for the LA riots. More Americans and the world would be seeing what they are now seeing in New Orleans  &mdash;  -only ten years sooner. With instant media and everyone carrying around small video cameras. It will only get better in the future.  But I wonder if anyone will learn anything.  It should be interesting to see Americas respons to New Orleans.  I have a feeling we may get a few new readers around here.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>A comparison with the LA riots produces the expected results:  combine underclass &#8220;african americans&#8221; and an opportunity for mass murder and mayhem and that is what you always get, viz. murder and mayhem.<br>
The two constants are 1) the presence of large numbers of underclass blacks and 2) any significant relaxation in law enforcement.<br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>   Today is Saturday, Sept3 1013am. I have an earie feeling for this laborday weekend. Los Angeles is seething. It has had the taste of blood in its teeth for a long time. This will be a long weekend. Those who we pay to sit and watch television, fester and complain, may well take inspiration from their brethren in Lost Orleans and recreate that grand spectacle of cultural diversity known as The LA riots. If so, Our Day has come. Heed these words.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>I&rsquo;m one new, mixed-ethnicity reader.  Believer, rather.  I&rsquo;d been reading for a while, but the idea of so openly   &mdash;   so &#8220;brazenly&#8221;   &mdash;   discussing race was tremendously unappealing.  Nevertheless, the bitter truth seems to be that race matters, greatly, and whitey ain&rsquo;t so evil afterall.</p>
<p>Ah well.  So be it.  Despite another of the great lies I&rsquo;d been led to believe, the truth isn&rsquo;t always uplifting.  </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The majority of looters(that is, thugs who took advantage of the riots) were Hispanic, but the rioters themselves were mostly black. Whites&rsquo; hands, admittedly, were not entirely clean. King deserved what he got, and even if such were not the case, the ensuing chaos and mayhem were outrageous. </p>
<p>My best friend&rsquo;s husband (a la Ann Landers) claimed the LA rioters were justified because they were oppressed minorities who did not make $30,000/yr. He entered law school that fall and now is an attorney who, among other things, defends criminals. I haven&rsquo;t spoken to him since Katrina, but I bet he stands up for the looters. Break my heart! </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The cascading ferver from the <span class="caps">L.A.</span> Riots hit not only major urban areas, it was happening in smaller communities as well.</p>
<p>In Crystal River, Florida blacks, as if on cue, joined the festivities, and were pulling whites from vehicles and beating them.  This in a general area for miles is about 99% white.</p>
<p>It was reported by the Citrus County Chronicle, a left wing, radical liberal rag, as just a mob attack without revealing the race of the perpetrators and victims.  Their nit-wit dork who runs the paper, Gerald Mulligan, believes it his job to decide what news to report and in what form, because he believes he is the messiah of goodness and tolerance, and to tell the truth would only add to the mayhem he feared, so he kept the incident hushed up as best he could.  You see, only he is wise enough to know what information you or I are allowed to have.</p>
<p>But the bottom line of all these incidences is that these moron blacks actually thought they were participating in the big Civil War II that would see them as taking control of the country after finishing whitey off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame they stopped and didn&rsquo;t carry on as they stupidly intended.  If they had, we&rsquo;d have far fewer to contend with now.</p>
<p>But as stupid as they are I&rsquo;m pretty certain we&rsquo;ll have another shot at them, whenever their stupidity allows their arrogance to again gain the upper hand.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Apparently Prez. Bush agreed with Cindy&rsquo;s best friend&rsquo;s husband. He rewarded America&rsquo;s Africans for the death, injury and destruction they caused by retrying the policemen who had been acquitted. They were subsequently convicted and sentenced to multiyear imprisonment to the great satisfaction of Africans and Liberals. This event put an end to whatever patriotism and affection that I had for America. From that time on America was my environment not my country. I was a &#8220;stranger in a strange land&#8221;, doing what I had to do, to survive. </p></font><p>Posted
