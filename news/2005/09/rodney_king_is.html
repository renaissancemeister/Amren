<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-king30sep30,1,6667343.story?coll=la-headlines-california">Rodney King Is Arrested After a Fight at His Home</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Sept. 30</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rodney King, whose videotaped beating by Los Angeles police led to the deadly Los Angeles riots in 1992, has been arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats following a fight involving his daughter, his girlfriend and a former girlfriend, Rialto police said Thursday. </p>
<p>King, 40, was arrested Wednesday. He is being held in lieu of $25,000 bail. </p>
<p>Police were called to King&rsquo;s home shortly after 4:15 p.m. Authorities said King&rsquo;s live-in girlfriend, Dawn Jean, 29, got into a fight with daughter Candace King, 23, who also lives in the home. </p>
<p>The daughter allegedly assaulted Jean, and Carmen Simpson, Candace King&rsquo;s mother, who also lives at the home, got involved in the fight, police said. </p>
<p>King allegedly threatened to kill his daughter and Simpson. Authorities said the daughter, who called police, said King was armed with a handgun, but it turned out to be a toy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the beating, he has had a string of run-ins with the law.</p>
<p>He walks with a limp since a 2003 accident in which he lost control of his car, crashed into a house at 100 mph and shattered his pelvis.</p>
