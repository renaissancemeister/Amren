<p><font size="3"><p>Oprah Winfrey is not a diva. At all. No way. She is so adamant on that point that she brought the head of Hermès USA onto her talk show yesterday to admit it and apologize in front of a national audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to say we&rsquo;re really sorry,&rdquo; Robert Chavez, the chief executive officer of Hermès USA, said contritely. &ldquo;You did meet up with one very, very rigid staff person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. Winfrey corrected him. &ldquo;Rigid or rude?&rdquo; she asked with icy sweetness. He hastily assented. &ldquo;Rigid and rude, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hermès incident was one of the more florid tabloid stories of the summer: Ms. Winfrey, one of the wealthiest and most famous women in the nation, was turned away from the Hermès flagship store on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré at closing time. That kind of resounding &ldquo;non&rdquo; rang a bell with anyone who has tried to argue with a Parisian salesperson. But many people also interpreted the rebuff as racism, arguing that Ms. Winfrey would have been treated better had she been white. (Simpler souls merely relished the prospect that someone as famous as Ms. Winfrey would be denied anything, ever.) </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Instead, she explained that the rudeness of one saleswoman had stung deep. &ldquo;Anybody who has been snubbed because you were not chic enough, or not thin enough, or not the right class, or the right color or whatever, I don&rsquo;t know what it was, you know that it is totally humiliating.&rdquo;</p>

If Oprah acts this way over a store&rsquo;s inconvenient closing   &mdash;   forcing the company head to come and grovel in public before her   &mdash;   I would hate to be stuck in a hurricane with her or try to provide her with disaster relief.</p></font><p>Posted

I think black mailing the owners to come on her show and gravel like dogs speaks for itself.She has really showed her true and racist ways lately.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>From the Desk of Tim Mc Hugh:<br>
Couple of thoughts on this one.<br><br>
1. Hard not to admire the Hermes exec for taking responsibility for his employees. Whether it is groveling or not. I had a millionaire ice company owner drive across town to apologize because his route driver had stolen stuff off our loading dock. All this to save a fifty dollar a month account. If I was Oprah, I would forget the &#8220;slight&#8221; and remember the man who lives &#8220;the buck stops here&#8221; philosophy.<br><br>
2. Hard to fault the French sales girl for covering her backside. She probably figured anyone who doesn`t respect closing hours would also keep her there half the night. <br><br>
3. Waiting on celebrities can be a &#8220;mixed bag&#8221; sometimes. One that I myself have forgone the older I get. <br><br>
4. Shows the limitations of power. Like the old joke about the Vice-President asking the busboy for more butter. The politico asks three times then puffs up and declares, &#8220;maybe you don`t know who I am! I am the Vice President of the United States!&#8221;<br><br>
 To which the busboy retorts, &#8220;Maybe you don`t know who I am, I`m the guy who brings the butter!&#8221; <br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>  Anybody who has ever been denied entrance to a store simply because that store was closed, well, you know how humiliating <strong>that</strong> can be. If a thin white woman had shown up when the store was closing, I&rsquo;m positive she wouldn&rsquo;t have been turned away. To think of the appalling rudeness of one woman who wanted to close the store on time. It&rsquo;s simply appalling. </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to find any reference to this supposed apology on Oprah&rsquo;s website, but Oprah is a bitch.  I would be ashamed to expect the kind of treatment she considers her birthright, and I would never expect anyone to come on national TV to apologize for treating me like any other member of the public.  I don&rsquo;t work retail, but I don&rsquo;t think that retail workers exist so that the rest of us will have someone to walk all over.  Oprah has enough ego for 20 people.  </p>
<p>I am grateful that I don&rsquo;t work retail, standing on my feet all day, putting up with people who think their pee is cleaner than mine.  I respect the people who wait on me because I know that they could be breaking and entering into my house while I am out harassing some sales clerk to let me into a store that is closed.  What is Oprah&rsquo;s problem?  I know what my problem is, and that is people like her.  </p></font><p>Posted

&ldquo;Rigid or rude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has always seemed to me that blacks misinterpret rudeness for racism.</p>
<p>I encounter rude and disinterested white people daily but I can&rsquo;t blame racism. Blacks, on the other hand, see rude and disinterested whites as racists.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Oprah needs no more money, so her motivations are likely not financial.</p>
<p>Most non-whites, blacks especially, seem well aware that if resegregated back outside of white society their own people would devolve back to a state resembling Haiti, or post-Katrina New Orleans, within weeks.</p>
<p>Her indignity and hurt feelings may well be a symptom of her own realization of black abilities, or lack thereof, versus Asians or Whites. Hard to believe she is shallow enough to care about buying purse #437 from Hermes, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>Methinks the average white liberal is also well aware, hence their hysterical efforts to shout down and stigmatize those who speak the truth about racial differences.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>&#8220;But why would the idiot from Hermes appear on her show?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well of course he was bought. I am sure the offer was made by Oprah as a pay off to help turn public opinion in support of her lame and bloated story of having been snubbed. With her simple and uneducated logic she has decided that it is better to pay off Hermes to admit wrongdoing, rather than admit she herself was rude, demanding, unreasonable, and racially intolerant. Remember the sales person from Hermes was white; had the sales person been black there would be less than the zero position for argument &#8220;the Daytime Blunder&#8221; has been making. </p>
<p>Give a few people (mostly black) with sad stories free cars and the world will love you.</p>
<p>Give a few displaced hurricane victims (mostly black) homes and you will be elevated to sainthood by those not able to see past their next welfare check.</p>
<p>Oprah is a selective racist, but a racist of the highest order, and protects her racism with the blanket of wealth.</p>
<p>I loved Oprah in the Color Purple because she was doing something she was well equipped to do, and that was act like something she is not. When she acts like that which she is her true color comes through, and it is not purple.<br>

She deserves credit for making all that money, but now she&rsquo;s got that creepy star affliction not unlike Michael Jackson or Madonna (with her fake British accent).<br>

  <font size="3"><p>I have a second-hand atrocious Oprah story.  I have a friend who is a flight attendant, and she works first class.  She has seen a lot of celebrities come and go, and until her Oprah experience, was a mudbutt-kissing lib.  When she greeted Oprah and graciously offered to do whatever she could to make her flight comfortable, Oprah glared up at her and said icily, &#8220;Please remove your hand from my arm.&#8221; The woman said this was accompanied by a look that could kill.  Oprah then said she would only deal with a black flight attendant.  When my friend explained that there was a black flight attendant, but she was assigned to coach, Oprah demanded to speak with an airline representative, and held up the flight while she argued that they needed to re-assign the black flight attendant to first class so that she could wait on Oprah.  Typical African behavior; they are the worst &#8220;classists&#8221; around.  Needless to say, my friend was shocked, hurt, and utterly dumbfounded; Oprah got her way; and the black flight attendant was afraid to have to wait on Oprah, but she had no choice and was re-assigned to wait solely on Oprah, leaving the remaining staff one short and spread thinner in ratio to wait on the rest of the paying customers of American airlines.</p>
<p>Another nightmare story through the airline grapevine was Dionne &#8220;psychic friend&#8221; Warwick, who refused to sign an autograph for a white flight attendant, who then auctioned off her entire Dionne collection on eBay for $2000.</p></font><p>Posted

The Hermes executive probably went back to his hotel suite, laughing at her silliness. Certainly the French people will have a good laugh over the affenfrau&rsquo;s antics. She&rsquo;ll return to the Hermes store, the people will present to fall all over her, and as she leaves, the store will erupt in laughter over the silly Black female Amrican. Predictable.</p>
<p>Playing the race card as she did, merely served to underscore how utterly silly the woman is. Had she had sense enough to <span class="caps">UNDERSTAND </span>that after a long business day, a store (and its people) have the right to stand down and close, people would have respected her. But attempting to trade not only on her &#8216;celebrity&rsquo; status, but her blackness, she only managed to earn everyone&rsquo;s contempt, in America as well as in France. But Blacks are mentally incapable of grasping that fine point.</p></font><p>Posted

 Watching her show it seems obvious that she has a large ego. She often &#8216;trumps&rsquo; specialists and then looks at the audience prompting them to applaud her superior opinions. She hands out gifts to all audience participants and expects them to grovel at her feet. Any black person on her show is well spoken and rich..Her show is so out of the realm of reality.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>What is the value of ratings saturation when they are saturated by morons?</p>
<p>What is the value of reading more, if the topics and writers are all liberal juggernauts?</p>
<p>Forgive me, but I will disagree with you on substance, if allowed to discount her diction. On the other hand, I have only ever watched one show, and that was more than ten years ago. Which, by the way, was all it took to make me run as fast as possible in the opposite direction.  <br>

  <font size="3"><p>I also concur with Undercover Black Man.  While I do not understand the appeal of the Oprah show (in fact, I&rsquo;ve never seen more than a minute or so of it) we could certainly do worse.  Agreed, the fact that she&rsquo;s gotten a few million bon-bon swillers to pick up a book (that&rsquo;s not a Harlequin Romance novel, to boot) makes her OK in my book.  She&rsquo;s probably no more of a diva than, say, the <span class="caps">WASP</span> Ice Princess Martha Stewart is.<br>

  <font size="3"><p>In the television business, there is an expression: &#8216;The illusion of crediblity&rsquo;.  The best example of this would be the late Peter Jennings.  His Q rating was phenominal.  Another great example is Walter Cronkite.  If you have ever read about him and his opinions, you quickly realize the man is   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m sorry to say   &mdash;   an idiot.  Uncle Walter could beam and glow with the best of them.  Write up the propaganda, opps, I mean news, give him the papers to read, and he could deliver.</p>
<p>Oprah has the &#8216;illusion of credibility&rsquo; and she is good on camera.</p>
<p>Oprah doesn&rsquo;t have children.  Because she doesn&rsquo;t care for children.  And out of that comes the fact that she doesn&rsquo;t care about children.  Forget any and everything we may see and hear to the contrary&hellip;that Oprah cares.  She in this real world test showed her true colours.  The staff at Hermes has to close and get home to make dinner for their families.  They have to make dinner for their children.  Routine and structure is important for children.  Childless Oprah would never think of that.  That is another reason staff need to close on time.  Having done and having family in retail, if you don&rsquo;t move the people out at closing time, they wander around for an hour, and leave without buying anything.  So the Hermes staff let Oprah in, then they end up getting home late, their kids go to bed at the normal time, but because the staff is late, dinner is cut short.  So effectively, Oprah would be taking food out of the mouths of these children.  Not all the food but say half the food?  So it would appear that Oprah believes that the &#8216;childfull&rsquo; people of the Hermes staff, and of the world, are less important and critical to Western Society, than the childless;  example being in this case, Oprah.</p>
<p>Also with all the books she reads, maybe she&rsquo;ll learn the meaning of the word &#8216;OPEN&rsquo;, and gather the basic concept of the word &#8216;CLOSED&rsquo;.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>This reminds me, I&rsquo;d like to recommend a delightful website, www.bitterwaitress.com, which catalogues exactly this type of celebrity misbehavior.  Especially, as the site name would suggest, celebrities who are lousy tippers.  (Also those who tip well and behave graciously.)  It&rsquo;s the place where put-upon service employees can get their revenge, and the rest of us can be entertained and learn a little bit about the folkways of the Entitled Class.</p>
<p>One hilarious example is the actor John Cusack.  A saleswoman from a Chicago housewares store reports of an encounter with Mr. Cusack and his &#8220;assistant.&#8221;  Cusack, instead of speaking directly to the saleswoman standing in front of him, would whisper into the ear of his assistant, then the assistant would say, &#8220;John would like&hellip;&#8221; or &#8220;John wants to know&hellip;&#8221;  The saleswoman handled the encounter like a pro, but what she <span class="caps">WANTED </span>to do was reply, &#8220;Tell John that&hellip;&#8221; or &#8220;Let John know that&hellip;&#8221;</p>
