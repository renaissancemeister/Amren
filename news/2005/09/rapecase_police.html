<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Authorities in Pakistan have suspended a police chief accused of ordering the rape of a married woman who was seeking the release of her detained husband. </p>
<p>Faisalabad police chief Khalid Abdullah was removed from his post after PM Shaukat Aziz ordered an inquiry into allegations against his department. </p>
<p>Mr Abdullah has denied any wrongdoing, accusing the woman of lying. </p>
<p>Hundreds of women are raped in Pakistan every year but only a fraction of the cases are reported. </p>
<p>The chief justice of Pakistan&rsquo;s Supreme Court, Iftikhar Chaudhry, has asked for a full report from the provincial authorities to be given to him in 10 days. </p>
<p>The 23-year-old woman said she was kept in illegal confinement for 15 days and raped by a police officer as &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; for seeking to publicise the detention of her husband. </p>
<p>The officer accused of the crime was suspended on Tuesday. </p>
<p>The woman said Mr Abdullah had ordered her rape. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Strict action will be taken against all those found involved in this incident,&rdquo; Mr Aziz told parliament on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Suicidal thoughts </p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Aamer Ahmed Khan says the woman&rsquo;s husband had been arrested by Faisalabad police for allegedly forging documents for stolen vehicles. </p>
<p>In April his wife went to the National Assembly to try to meet lawmakers to help her secure her husband&rsquo;s release. </p>
<p>Her pleas fell on deaf ears as the authorities were more concerned with the security breach that had allowed her to enter the parliament building. </p>
<p>She was handed over to Faisalabad police and released a month later.</p>
<p>The woman said she was abducted from Lahore soon after her release, blindfolded and handcuffed and driven to a house where she was kept for 15 days and raped by a police officer. </p>
<p>She told a local TV channel on Tuesday that she wanted to kill herself but was stopped by &ldquo;the cries of my two small children&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The suspended official told Associated Press that the woman was a &ldquo;liar&rdquo; and that people who knew her were aware of her &ldquo;bad character&rdquo;. </p>
<p>A three-member police team has been set up to conduct the inquiry. </p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a number of high-profile rape cases in recent months. </p>
<p>The most highly publicised is the case of Mukhtar Mai, 33, who was raped in Punjab province in 2002, allegedly on the order of a village council. </p>
<p>Since then she has become an icon in the campaign for women&rsquo;s justice in conservative Pakistan. </p>
<p>This week, tribal council members in Karachi were accused of preventing a rape case being reported to police. </p>
<p>The council instead allegedly imposed a fine on the accused.</p>
