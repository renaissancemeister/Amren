<div align="left"><i>Jennifer Lee, New York Times, Sept. 17</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>In the last several years, New York City has had more baby girls named Fatoumata than Lisa, more Aaliyahs than Melissas, more Chayas than Christinas. There have been more baby boys named Moshe than Peter, more Miguels than Jeffreys, more Ahmeds than Stanleys.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the city&rsquo;s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene released the name breakdown for the 124,099 babies born in New York City in 2004. That, together with data stretching back to 1920, shows that in a city that is fashion-conscious and full of immigrants, some foreign-sounding names have become arguably more New York than American classics like Carol, Susan, Stephen and Harry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the names released yesterday, Michael and Emily still hang on to their top positions, with Daniel and Ashley close behind. However, there were differences across groups, with Emily the most popular name among Asian-Americans, Ashley the top name for Hispanics, Kayla among blacks and Sarah for whites. And, just for the record, there were 27 Katrinas born last year, placing the name out of the top 300.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Added up, the spellings of Muhammad, which vary across the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia (Mohammed, Mohammad, Mohamed, Muhammad, Mouhamed), make it a Top 50 name &mdash; ahead of Richard and Charles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Esther, Grace and Hannah have long been popular for Korean-American girls nationwide due to the Christian missionary influence, Professor Lieberson said. Fatoumata, a popular West African name that was given to 41 of the city&rsquo;s baby girls in 2004, may be a local variation of the Arabic Muslim name, Fatima, though its exact origins are unclear. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some classic men&rsquo;s names &mdash; Michael (1), David (6) and John (19) &mdash; have hung on in the Top 20. Others &mdash; Edward, Charles and George, (all names popular with British royalty) &mdash; no longer make the cut for the Top 50, at Nos. 78, 81 and 91, respectively. </p>
<p>Black female names tracked white female names until the late 1960&rsquo;s. The city&rsquo;s top five black girls&rsquo; names in 1965 were Lisa, Sharon, Kim, Denise and Karen. But spurred by the black power movement and media phenomena like &ldquo;Roots,&rdquo; certain prefixes and suffixes inspired by Islamic and African names, like &ldquo;Lat,&rdquo; &ldquo;isha&rdquo; and &ldquo;ika,&rdquo; became fashionable for black girls in 1975: Tamika (No. 3 among black girls in 1975), Latoya (16), Latisha (20), Latasha (75) and Shameka (88). </p>
<p>Since then, the divergence has kept growing. In 2003, not a single one of the top 20 girls names for blacks and whites overlapped &mdash; though both strongly featured names ending in the &ldquo;a&rdquo; sound. White families often try to revive classic names that have fallen out of use like Olivia or Hannah, whereas blacks are more likely to improvise, Professor Lieberson said. But now improvisation is becoming more common across the board.</p>
<p>And Asian-American names have their own quirk: They lag mainstream America, with last year&rsquo;s top 10 list of Asian-American baby names filled with names that hit their overall peaks a generation ago: Jason, Brian, Eric, Michelle, Tiffany, Nicole, Amy and Kelly. This results from a tendency of Asian-American parents to take a cue from the names of adult peers, Professor Lieberson said. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>As far as I am personally concerned if NY city vanished from the face of the earth tomorrow we as a country would be ahead.  The poliferation of absolutely absurd &#8220;african american&#8221; names is such a standing joke that when I worked in the obstetrics ward in a DC hospital we were considering making up a book of such names for entertainment.  I am sure others have done the same and there are a few floating around somewhere.  Of course the creaters of the names were typically underclass black females and the children were all as we used to say &#8220;out of wedlock births&#8221;.  One has to have a certain amount of sympathy for a newborn, born to an ingorant black &#8220;woman&#8221; as the 3rd or 5th illegitimate welfare ticket given a name which sounds original to someone who is functionally mentally retarded.  But such is life in big city <span class="caps">USA </span>today.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>  As a restaurant manager in 1999 In Rochester <span class="caps">NY,</span> I had the absolute pleasure of having an almost entirely African-American staff, mainly females.  My employees were:</p>
<p>Shinoya<br>
Shameka<br><br>
Jamaya<br><br>
Shanelle<br><br>
Shamaya, and last but not least Shawna.</p>
<p> Friday nights at dinnertime were exruciatingly painful for me as this group of girls would discuss at length the daily events of their lives, loudly, in front of 40 to 60 customers.  Obviously customer service was disregarded.  After terminating one of them for being rude to a customer, I had to deal with an event later in the week that involved eight of her relatives coming into my store to personally confront me and ask about the events that led to her termination.  Theft was the reason, more specifically, her giving away free food to these same family members who would come to the restaurant late at night.</p>
<p>  Well, after the confrontation my car was vandalized in the parking lot.</p>
<p>  I no longer work in food service, and nor will I ever, considering that the labor pool for employees in this market is simply so absolutely degraded that I believe it is an impossibility to manage a restaurant or other food related business in this country, at least in an urban area..  What the heck happened to the hard-working youth?  I see nothing but angry blacks and immigrants.</p>
