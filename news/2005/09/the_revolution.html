						<p><font size="3">Most Americans do not give much thought 
          to Haiti. They may know it is a black, French-speaking country, which 
          shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. 
          From what they see on television they realize it is a poor, violent 
          nation ruled by a succession of dictators, each seemingly worse than 
          the last. They may also associate Haiti with AIDS, crime, drug gangs, 
          boat people and environmental disasters. These are all correct associations 
          but the history of Haiti puts all this in a broader context. It offers 
          one of the most sobering lessons about race in the New World. It is 
          a story that is rarely told, but the grim realities of the aitian revolution 
          and its aftermath are just as worthy of our attention today as they 
          were 200 years ago. None other than Lothrop Stoddard (see AR, Jan. 2000), 
          who wrote his Ph.D. thesis on Haiti and later published it as <i>The 
          French Revolution in San Domingo</i>, called the black uprising &#147;the 
          first shock between the ideals of white supremacy and racial equality.&#148;</font></p>

        </table><p><font size="3">Haiti is a nation of eight million people 
          packed into an area the size of Maryland. The illiteracy rate is 60 
          percent, the unemployment rate 65 percent, and the average <i>per capita 
          </i>annual income is estimated at $225-the lowest in the hemisphere 
          and less than one tenth the Latin America/Caribbean average. The United 
          Nations says 60 percent of the population is sexually active by age 
          12 and the average number of births per woman is 4.8-the highest in 
          the hemisphere. The population is expected to double to 16 million by 
          2030, and Haiti&rsquo;s overpopulation is ravaging the environment. At 
          the turn of the century it still had half of its original forests, but 
          today only 1.5 percent are left. Most Haitians depend on firewood for 
          fuel. Every year American relief workers plant six million saplings 
          but Haitians cut down 25-30 million trees, causing the erosion of 15,000 
          acres of farmland. As a result, 25 of Haiti&rsquo;s 30 watersheds are 
          essentially denuded. Haiti must import 60 percent of its food, and is 
          teeming with poor, diseased, desperate people eager to come to America. 
          Only the US Coast Guard prevents the nation from moving <i>en masse 
          </i>to Florida. It was not always like this in the land once called 
          &#147;the gem of the West Indies.&#148;</font></p>

        <p><font size="3">Columbus discovered the island in 1492 
          and named it &#147;la Isla Espa&ntilde;ola,&#148; which was later shortened 
          to Hispaniola. For a brief period, until the promising discoveries of 
          Peru and Mexico, it was the center of Spanish colonization. The Spanish 
          did not stay long but their stay was important. They killed most of 
          the Arawak Indians, and when they left for other colonies they set their 
          livestock free. The Spanish maintained a presence on the eastern part 
          of the island but abandoned the west. Other Europeans ignored Hispaniola 
          for nearly 100 years but settlers who came in the 1600s found an island 
          filled with cattle and pigs, and empty of hostile natives. The new arrivals 
          to the western part were mostly buccaneers who preyed on Spanish ships 
          and hunted the abundant wild cattle (the word &#147;buccaneer&#148; 
          comes from the French <i>boucaner</i>, &#147;to barbecue beef&#148;). 
          As the Spanish consolidated their hold to the east, the French slowly 
          took control of the west, which became French San Domingo. By the 1700s 
          the colony was turning from what Stoddard called &#147;a nest of hunters 
          and pirates,&#148; into a thriving outpost of agriculture and trade. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">At the time of the French Revolution 
          in 1789, French San Domingo was at its most prosperous. In the rich 
          aluvial Plaine du Nord there were a thousand plantation houses set behind 
          pillared gateways, which sparkled at night with the illumination of 
          elaborate balls. The colony was one of the leading exporters of coffee, 
          sugar, cocoa and cotton, and in 1789 the dollar value of its trade exceeded 
          that of the United States. However, its affluence was based on a fragile 
          racial dynamic of 40,000 whites ruling 500,000 black slaves-the majority 
          African-born. There was also an intermediate class of 27,000 mulattos 
          who had come about because of an initial scarcity of white women, and 
          which would play an important role in the future of the colony.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Even after the arrival of French women, 
          it was common for wealthy whites to keep mulatto mistresses. Still, 
          the color line was well observed when it came to marriage. The few white 
          men who married mulattos were shunned by white society and stripped 
          of many rights-with the French government&rsquo;s approval. One priest 
          who had refused marriage to a white and a mulatto was commended by a 
          French minister who wrote: &#147;His Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure is not 
          to permit the mixing of the bloods; your prevention of the marriage 
          in question is therefore approved.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Officially classified as &#147;free 
          people of color,&#148; mulattos could own land, businesses, and even 
          slaves. They despised the slaves but resented the whites, to whom they 
          were subordinate. Mulattos could not vote or hold office. They were 
          segregated in theaters, shops and churches, and even the wealthiest 
          mulatto was the social inferior of the poorest white. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Whites of all classes as well as the 
          authorities in France considered the color line natural and necessary. 
          Outnumbered 13-to-1 by blacks and mulattos, whites had good reason to 
          stay united in the face of occasional uprisings on rural plantations 
          in which slaves slaughtered all the whites they could catch. Moreover, 
          the French blamed the relative failure of Spanish and Portuguese colonies 
          on miscegenation, and did not want to make the same mistake. Whites 
          would maintain the color line at all costs, but the bitterness of the 
          mixed-race class would soon find a sympathetic ear. In the words of 
          the revolutionary leader Honor&eacute; de Mirabeau, whites &#147;slept 
          on the edge of Vesuvius.&#148;</font></p>

        <p> </p>
        <p><font size="3">After the French Revolution and the 
          overthrow of Louis XVI, most whites in San Domingo expected to receive 
          more say in running the colony. This hope turned to terror as they learned 
          of the new regime&rsquo;s revolutionary racial plans. In 1788 a French 
          pamphleteer named Jacques Brissot had formed the <i>Amis des Noirs</i> 
          (Friends of the Blacks). Patterned after English abolitionist groups, 
          the society soon became far more radical. Most of the future Jacobin 
          leaders such as Lafayette, Condorcet, Mirabeau and Robbespierre were 
          members, and chapters soon spread throughout France. San Domingo was 
          subject to French rule, and colonists began to wonder how far these 
          zealots would take their slogan &#147;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.&#148;</font></p>

        <p><font size="3">Almost from the beginning, the National 
          Assembly in Paris pushed for full citizenship rights for mulattos. Mulattos 
          were emboldened and whites distressed when the Jacobins announced in 
          1792 they were sending a civil commission-supported by 6,000 troops-to 
          San Domingo to enforce the rights of mulattos. When the black slaves 
          heard the news they went into open revolt in the hope that they, too, 
          would get freedom. Whites in San Domingo were therefore under siege 
          from slaves, mulattos and their own government. One white who managed 
          to return to France predicted the outcome: &#147;You may announce unreservedly 
          that it is all over with San Domingo. One of three things will follow: 
          the whites will exterminate the whole mulatto caste; the mulattos will 
          destroy the whites; or the negroes will profit by these dissensions 
          to annihilate both the whites and the mulattos. But in any case, San 
          Domingo should be erased from the maps of France.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The commission arrived and went to work, 
          forcing whites to recognize full citizenship rights for mulattos. The 
          result was chaos and race war. By 1793, most whites had either been 
          killed or fled to France or the United States. (About 10,000 settled 
          in the U.S. where they were received sympathetically. Many soldiers 
          who had accompanied the French commission also left with them rather 
          than help destroy their own people.) </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">With the defeat of the whites, mulattos 
          expected to rule in their place, exploiting the labor of black slaves, 
          but the blacks, led by General Pierre Dominique Toussaint L&rsquo;Ouverture 
          (1743-1803) and supported by the French government, rose up against 
          the mulattos. Badly outnumbered and without allies, &#147;the yellow 
          caste&#148; soon met the same fate as the whites. L&rsquo;Ouverture and 
          his troops slaughtered them by the thousand. </font></p>

        <p><font size="3">By 1801, the former slave was supreme 
          ruler of San Domingo. He strengthened ties with the British, who helped 
          keep his troops well armed in exchange for supplies from the naturally 
          rich island. In 1800 he invited whites back to the island, assuring 
          them they would be well treated. A few thousand returned. He gave many 
          back their plantations and ordered most blacks to work for the whites 
          and for the state. The powerful military made short work of anyone who 
          opposed this neo-slavery. When L&rsquo;Ouverture&rsquo;s nephew, a black 
          general named Moyse, led a revolt against these &#147;pro-white&#148; 
          policies L&rsquo;Ouverture put down the insurrection and executed his 
          nephew. In 1801 he drew up a new constitution and appointed himself 
          &#147;Governor for life&#148; with the right to appoint his successor. 
          Much like post-colonial African leaders, the &#147;black George Washington,&#148; 
          as he is often called, made himself dictator.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Why didn&rsquo;t the French take a greater 
          role in suppressing the violence after more conservative elements regained 
          control in Paris? In fact, Napoleon wanted to send troops but was stretched 
          thin with campaigns in India and Egypt and war with Britain. In 1802, 
          after peace with Britain, Napoleon did manage to send a force of 12,000 
          under Charles Leclerc with orders to take San Domingo, restore it to 
          French rule, and arrest L&rsquo;Ouverture. Napoleon did not at first 
          plan to reestablish slavery but he wanted to restore French sovereignty 
          over a white-run colony. The outnumbered French defeated the blacks, 
          forcing L&rsquo;Ouverture to surrender in the spring of 1802. Leclerc 
          thought it best to pardon L&rsquo;Ouverture and let him return to civilian 
          life rather than exile him to France, but kept a wary eye on him. Most 
          of the black soldiers came over to the victorious French side. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">What appeared to be a success soon turned 
          to failure. That summer a great many French soldiers, as well as thousands 
          of civilians, caught yellow fever and died. L&rsquo;Ouverture began to 
          plot an uprising against the weakened French, but blacks loyal to Leclerc 
          managed to lure him within the French lines and capture him. Leclerc 
          packed L&rsquo;Ouverture off to jail in France where he caught tuberculosis 
          and died. Nevertheless, as disease continued to ravage the white troops, 
          Leclerc began to depend increasingly on the doubtful loyalty of black 
          generals and their followers. To Leclerc&rsquo;s dismay, Napoleon rescinded 
          the ban on the slave trade and urged the re-establishment of slavery 
          in the colonies. The black soldiers were furious, and many went into 
          insurrection. Napoleon reestablished restrictions on mulattos as well-something 
          completely impossible to enforce in San Domingo-which broke down the 
          strong antipathy between blacks and mulattos and united them against 
          the French. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Leclerc himself died of yellow fever 
          later in 1802 but the death knell of white-run San Domingo was the outbreak 
          in May 1803 of another war with Britain. The British blockaded the island 
          and supported the blacks and mulattos in what was now open race war 
          against the French. In November 1803 the French surrendered and sailed 
          away, leaving San Domingo in the hands of Jean-Jacques Dessalines (1758-1806), 
          a former slave who had been one of L&rsquo;Ouverture&rsquo;s generals. 
          It is this combination of yellow fever and support from the British 
          that accounts for the Afrocentric claim that a black army &#147;defeated&#148; 
          Napoleon. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Dessalines, who crowned himself Emperor 
          Jacques I, wanted to break all ties with France. One symbolic step was 
          to change the name of the colony to Haiti, which is what the Arawaks 
          called the island. He guaranteed safety to whites who remained, and 
          even encouraged more to come, but this was a ruse. In early 1805, he 
          ordered their extermination. A French officer who escaped described 
          the carnage:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&#147;The murder of the whites in detail 
          began at Port-au-Prince in the first days of January [1805], but on 
          the 17th and 18th of March they were finished off en masse. All, without 
          exception, have been massacred, down to the very women and children. 
          &hellip; A young mulatto named Fifi Pariset ranged the town like a madman 
          searching the houses to kill the little children. Many of the men and 
          women were hewn down by sappers, who hacked off their arms and smashed 
          in their chests. Some were poniarded, others mutilated, others &rsquo;passed 
          on the bayonet,&rsquo; others disemboweled with knives or sabers, still 
          others stuck like pigs. At the beginning a great number were drowned. 
          The same general massacre has taken place all over the colony, and as 
          I write you these lines I believe there are not twenty whites still 
          alive-and these not for long.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">With this final slaughter, French San 
          Domingo vanished from history and the black nation of Haiti arrived.</font></p>

          Hemisphere-after the United States-to gain independence, and Haitians 
          will officially mark their bicentennial in 2004. It is unlikely that 
          even Afrocentric blacks will celebrate this milestone with much enthusiasm. 
          After 200 years of black rule there is little of which to boast. A United 
          Nations report says Haiti may soon be incapable of supporting human 
          life. </font></p>

        <p><font size="3">Besides AIDS, crime, drugs, poverty 
          and environmental destruction, Haiti has a form of slavery called <i>restavec</i>. 
          A Haitian Creole term meaning &#147;stays with,&#148; a <i>restavec</i> 
          is a poor child sold to a wealthy family as a servant. The government 
          itself accepts a U.N. estimate of 300,000 such children in Haiti. Jean-Robert 
          Cadet, a former <i>restavec</i> who escaped to America wrote a book 
          in 1999 called <i>Restavec: From Haitian Slave Child to Middle Class 
          American</i>. He says <i>restavecs </i>&#147;are treated worse than 
          slaves because &hellip; their supply seems inexhaustible.&#148; Mr. Cadet 
          says <i>restavecs </i>are often beaten and raped. Despite prodding from 
          the U.N., the European Union, and the Catholic Church, Haitian officials 
          have done nothing to stop this practice. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Many Haitian children are fed by aid 
          from the U.S. and the U.N. Haiti gets by far the biggest slice of U.S. 
          aid in the Western Hemisphere (20 percent). From 1994 to 1999, U.S. 
          taxpayers poured over $2.3 billion dollars into Haiti but relief officials 
          are giving up in dismay at the meager results. Even some in Congress 
          have begun to notice we have little to show for our money. Representative 
          Porter Goss of Florida says, &#147;We&rsquo;ve been ripped off in Haiti 
          and I don&rsquo;t see why we should put more money into it. There&rsquo;s 
          so much corruption that the only way to make sure aid gets to the people 
          is to fly down there yourself with some food, hand it to a Haitian, 
          and watch him eat it in your presence.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Attempts to bolster the Haitian economy 
          have failed. In 1997 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright flew to Haiti 
          to launch a new privatization program funded by U.S. investors, and 
          to celebrate the return of a state-run flour mill to the private sector. 
          Miss Albright&rsquo;s triumphal visit to the mill was scuttled when advance 
          men found it occupied by angry former workers demanding more severance 
          pay. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">What could have been a tropical vacation 
          paradise has been ruined, and is so wracked with crime no travel agency 
          will recommend it as a destination. &#147;You&rsquo;re not looking at 
          a tropical country,&#148; says Ed Scott, a contractor for U.S. aid to 
          Haiti; &#147;you&rsquo;re looking at a Nevada desert.&#148; Tourists 
          venture in at their own risk. In January 2000 a French couple was stoned 
          to death along with their Haitian driver during a robbery. A few days 
          later an American couple was carjacked at gunpoint and the woman shot 
          dead.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Despite President Clinton&rsquo;s claim 
          that the 1994 invasion was to &#147;restore democracy,&#148; Haiti has 
          almost always been ruled by strongmen. Of the 40 rulers of Haiti from 
          it&rsquo;s independence to the 1994 invasion, only four left office peacefully. 
          Most of the rest were either murdered, ousted in coups, or fled into 
          exile (see chart). In 1957 and in 1988 there were four different regimes 
          in a single year. In 1999 then-president Ren&eacute; Preval &#147;postponed&#148; 
          elections five times and refused to call Parliament into session. He 
          ruled by decrees enforced by the 6,000-man Haitian National Police. 
          That year the UN accused the police of committing over 500 serious crimes, 
          including 50 murders.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">When elections do take place they are 
          a joke. In 1997 only six percent of the voters even bothered to show 
          up at the polls for parliamentary elections. The results were annulled 
          because of fraud. In May 2000 there was finally another parliamentary 
          election. Fifteen people were killed leading up to the vote, two were 
          killed on the day of the vote, and three opposition leaders killed after 
          the vote (one was stoned to death). The government arrested more than 
          20 opposition candidates after the elections. The balloting itself was 
          rife with fraud. The ruling Lavalas Party of Mr. Preval and former president 
          Jean-Bertrand Aristide controlled the polling stations and thousands 
          of votes were &#147;lost&#148; in transit to the capital Port-au-Prince.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Opponents accuse Mr. Preval of being 
          a puppet of Mr. Aristide, a Marxist former priest ousted in a <i>coup 
          d&rsquo;etat</i> and put back into power after the US invasion in 1994. 
          Mr. Aristide was barred from consecutive terms by the Haitian constitution 
          but still &#147;won&#148; a November 2000 election with 92 percent of 
          the vote, after an opposition boycott. Not even the United Nations could 
          stomach this farce. It announced it was closing its civilian support 
          mission to Haiti, which was supposed to promote democracy and human 
          rights.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Haiti has made one genuinely unique 
          gift to world culture: voodoo. Eighty percent of the population is Catholic, 
          20 percent are Protestants, and all 100 percent believe in voodoo. Up 
          until the 1950s, Catholics tried to stamp out voodoo but have now adopted 
          some of its rituals. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Mr. Aristide writes in his autobiography, 
          &#147;I do not consider voodoo to be an antagonist or an enemy of the 
          Christian faith,&#148; but rather a vital expression of &#147;a society 
          close to nature, black and Haitian.&#148; He added that &#147;in the 
          veins of voodoo flows a blood that is Christian.&#148; Protestant missionaries 
          report that many of their &#147;converts&#148; are ardent voodoo believers 
          just looking for extra protection. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Mr. Aristide, lapsed priest, is not 
          the first man with a religious background to run Haiti. Fran&ccedil;ois 
          &#147;Papa Doc&#148; Duvalier liked to appear in public dressed as the 
          voodoo deity Baron Samedi. Likewise, at the time of the U.S. invasion, 
          the military leaders scoffed at the American threat. Provisional President 
          Emile Jonassaint said the country&rsquo;s three zombie battalions would 
          crawl out of their graves at the bidding of their voodoo masters and 
          smite the Americans.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">What about the Haitians who come here? 
          There are approximately two million Haitians living abroad, mainly in 
          the U.S. and Canada. Since more than eight percent of Haitians are estimated 
          to have the HIV virus, this represents a considerable health risk, but 
          Haitians bring other things with them. In 1998, a Haitian woman on Long 
          Island was almost burned to death in a ceremony by her voodoo priest. 
          He was apparently trying to remove evil spirits from her house when 
          he doused her with a flammable liquid and set her on fire. When authorities 
          charged him with attempted murder local Haitians rallied to his defense. 
          &#147;Like a lot of ethnic groups who&rsquo;ve migrated here, we&rsquo;ve 
          brought our culture with us,&#148; explained a community leader.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">They have taken the same culture to 
          Canada, where a judge decided it puts a different perspective on certain 
          crimes. When two Haitians took turns raping and smothering a young Haitian 
          woman, Judge Monique Dubreuil gave them only 18 months house arrest 
          and 100 hours of community service. &#147;The absence of regret of the 
          two accused seems to be related more to the cultural context, particularly 
          with regard to relations with women,&#148; she explained. She may be 
          right. In 1997 Miami police were tipped off about a possible wife beating. 
          When they arrived at the address they found a woman tied to a bed and 
          a man swinging a piece of wood. The Haitian couldn&rsquo;t understand 
          what the fuss was about. &#147;I wasn&rsquo;t beating someone else&rsquo;s 
          wife,&#148; he explained. &#147;This is <i>my </i>wife.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Even a few <i>restavecs</i> have turned 
          up in America. In 1999, Florida police acting on a tip from neighbors 
          removed a filthy, unkempt 12-year-old girl from a Haitian home in upscale 
          Pembroke Pines. She was both a drudge worker and a sex toy for the young 
          man of the house, who had been raping her since she was nine. A trickle 
          of other slaves have escaped, and authorities have no idea how many 
          more <i>restavecs </i>are still hidden among the growing number of Haitian 
          immigrants.</font></p>

        <p><font size="3">More Haitians live in Miami than anywhere 
          else in America. Their presence does not seem to please Miami&rsquo;s 
          Cubans or even its blacks. Last year a black activist tried to prevent 
          government funds earmarked for &#147;African-Americans&#148; from being 
          shared by Haitians. This angered Haitians, who reminded Miami&rsquo;s 
          blacks that Haitians will soon outnumber them. This may not be pleasant. 
          A letter to a Miami newspaper from a newcomer suggests relations are 
          not good: &#147;My experience as a Haitian-American with African-American 
          schoolmates was one filled with racial epithets such as H.B.O. (Haitian 
          body odor), Haitians eat cats, Haitians are boat people, and Haitians 
          have AIDS. These African-American kids were taught at home to despise 
          Haitians.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Nor is it likely to be pleasant for 
          the rest of America. The poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere-a 
          perfect little chunk of Africa-lurks just 600 miles off the coast of 
          Florida. A U.S. Embassy survey in November 1999 found that 70 percent 
          of Haitians have given &#147;serious thought&#148; to leaving. As things 
          get worse they won&rsquo;t just think about it. Former U.S. ambassador 
          to Haiti Ernest Preeg says bluntly: &#147;If we didn&rsquo;t have a credible 
          Coast Guard interdiction policy-which presently sends these people back-you 
          would be talking about hundreds of thousands landing on our beaches.&#148; 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Some people want to let them come. Black 
          and liberal groups complained bitterly last year about a New Year&rsquo;s 
          Eve operation that sent back 400 Haitian boat people. U.S. Rep. Connie 
          Meek (D-Fl) led a group of black protesters waving placards saying &#147;Equal 
          Justice for Haitians,&#148; and demanding the 400 be allowed to &#147;stay.&#148; 
          They want to give Haitians the same rights as Cubans fleeing communism, 
          so that if they set foot in the U.S. they will be let in. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">If these groups get their wish we will 
          be importing the descendants of the people who slaughtered thousands 
          of whites and made Haiti unlivable. In sufficient numbers they will 
          have the same effect on America. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Of course, we need not look as far as 
          Haiti to understand the link between race and civilization, and what 
          it means for America. Haiti is nothing more than Camden or East St. 
          Louis writ large, and without the surrounding white society to support 
          it. Africans remake Africa wherever they may go.</font> </p>
