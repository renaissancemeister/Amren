						<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the aftermath 
  of Hurricane Katrina, which blasted the Gulf Coast on Aug. 29, the entire world 
  has seen images that leave no doubt that what is repeatedly called the sole 
  remaining superpower can be reduced to squalor and chaos nearly as gruesome 
  as anything found in the Third World. The weather&mdash;a Category 4 hurricane&mdash;certainly 
  had something to do with it, but the most serious damage was done not by nature 
  but by man.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Much has been 
  and will be written about why the levees that are supposed to keep the water 
  out of below-sea-level New Orleans failed. There will be bitter recrimination 
  about whether the federal rescue effort could have been launched sooner. Commissions 
  will be set up to ask questions and lessons will no doubt be learned. But there 
  was another human failing that was far more ominous and intractable. No commissions 
  will be set up to study it, and official America will refuse to learn any lessons 
  from it. In the orgy of finger-pointing that is coming, it will be all but forgotten. 
  That human failing&mdash;vastly more significant than the ones the commissions 
  will investigate&mdash;is the barbaric behavior of the people of New Orleans.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">New Orleans 
  is 67 percent black, and about half the blacks are poor. Of the city&rsquo;s 
  480,000 people, all but an estimated 80 to 100 thousand left before the hurricane 
  struck. This meant that aside from patients in hospitals and eccentrics in the 
  French Quarter, most of the people who stayed behind were not just blacks, but 
  lower-class blacks without the means or foresight to leave.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Katrina hit 
  on the morning of Monday, Aug. 29. Immediately after the winds died down, the 
  first reaction was one of relief. The hurricane had jogged east, and the city 
  was battered but still standing. Then the levees broke&mdash;apparently some 
  time on Tuesday&mdash;and the city began to flood. Before long, 80 percent of 
  New Orleans was under as much as 20 feet of water, and what had been only a storm 
  became a disaster.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The city&rsquo;s 
  70,000-seat football stadium, known as the Superdome, had been officially designated 
  as a public shelter before the hurricane, and several thousand people were already 
  there the night before the storm. It had some food supplies, cots, and medical 
  supplies. But when the waters began to rise, people poured in from all directions, 
  swelling its numbers to an estimated 25,000. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">People came 
  because their houses were under water, but also because New Orleans very quickly 
  collapsed in banditry. Looting began even while the storm was still blowing. 
  At first there was sympathetic clucking about the need for food and medicine, 
  but news clips of blacks wading happily through waist-deep water with television 
  sets over their heads dispelled that view.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The day after 
  the hurricane, a reporter caught the atmosphere of high-spirited chaos at a 
  Wal-Mart in the Lower Garden District. People were grabbing things as quickly 
  as they could, smashing open jewelry cabinets and scooping up double-handfuls. 
  One man packed his van so full of electronic equipment he could not close the 
  rear doors. A teenage girl passed out, face down, and people stepped on her. 
  A man stopped to roll her onto her back, and she vomited pink liquid. &#147;This 
  is f***ed up,&#148; he said, and rolled her back on her stomach. An NBC correspondent 
  filmed black, uniformed police strolling through the aisles, filling shopping 
  carts. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At one store, 
  a police officer broke the glass on the DVD case so civilians would not cut 
  themselves trying to break it, but one man was ungrateful. &#147;The police 
  got all the best stuff,&#148; he said. &#147;They&rsquo;re crookeder than us.&#148; 
  One woman stocking up on makeup was glad to see the officers. &#147;It must 
  be legal,&#148; she said. &#147;The police are here taking stuff, too.&#148; 
  </font></p>
<div align="left"></div>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Violence of 
  all kinds quickly spread through the paralyzed city, where robbery, rape and 
  even murder became routine. There were still thousands of people trapped on 
  rooftops and in attics, but on Sept. 1, Mayor Ray Nagin called the entire police 
  force off of rescue work and ordered it to secure the city. The response form 
  the force? An estimated 200 officers just walked off the job. &#147;They indicated 
  that they had lost everything and didn&rsquo;t feel that it was worth them going 
  back to take fire from looters and losing their lives,&#148; explained Henry 
  Whitehorn, chief of the Louisiana State Police. Many disappeared without a word. 
  Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish in New Orleans also said his men were 
  deserting. &#147;They want to be with their families,&#148; he said. &#147;Well, 
  I want to be with my family too, but you don&rsquo;t quit in the middle of a 
  crisis.&#148; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two police 
  officers, including the department&rsquo;s official spokesman Paul Accardo committed 
  suicide by shooting themselves in the head. The London Times estimated that 
  one in five officers refused to work, and some of those who stayed in uniform 
  were useless. When Debbie Durso, a tourist from Washington, Michigan, asked 
  a policeman for help he told her &#147;Go to hell&mdash;it&rsquo;s every man for 
  himself.&#148; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The collapse 
  of security made rescue and relief nearly impossible. &#147;No one anticipated 
  the disintegration or the erosion of the civilian police force in New Orleans,&#148; 
  explained Lieutenant General Steven Blum of the National Guard. He said the 
  city was operating on only one third of its pre-storm strength of 1,500 officers, 
  and that the guard had to switch from rescue to law enforcement: &#147;And that&rsquo;s 
  when we started flowing military police into the theater.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">New Orleans 
  has had only black mayors since 1978, and has spent decades making the police 
  force as black as possible. It established a city-residency requirement for 
  officers to keep suburban whites from applying for jobs, and lowered recruitment 
  standards so blacks could pass them. Katrina blew away any pretence that the 
  force was competent.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(On September 
  5, exactly a week after the hurricane, Mayor Ray Nagin offered to pay for the 
  entire police force, firefighters, and city emergency workers to go on five-day 
  vacations&mdash;with their families&mdash;to Las Vegas or some other destination. 
  He said there were enough National Guard in the city to maintain order, and 
  that his men &#147;have been through a lot.&#148; He brushed off suggestions 
  that this was dereliction of duty. He even asked the Federal Emergency Management 
  Agency (FEMA) to pay for the vacations, but FEMA refused. &#147;We haven&rsquo;t 
  turned over control of the city,&#148; a city spokesman explained. &#147;We&rsquo;re 
  going to leave a skeleton force&mdash;about 20 percent of the department&mdash;for 
  leadership and liaison with the troops while we get some rest.&#148;)</font></p>
<div align="left"></div>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">New Orleans 
  has a high crime rate at the best of times&mdash;it is usually in top contention 
  for the American city with the highest murder rate&mdash;and looted and stolen 
  firearms spilled into the street. Some blacks fired on any symbol of authority, 
  blazing away at rescue helicopters and Coast Guard vessels. Several days after 
  the hurricane, with desperate people still waving for help from rooftops, FEMA 
  said conditions were too dangerous to attempt rescues.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On Wednesday, 
  along one stretch of Highway 10, hundreds of volunteer firefighters, auxiliary 
  coastguards and citizens with small boats were anxious to reach people, but 
  could not set out because of sniper fire. &#147;We are trying to do our job 
  here but we can&rsquo;t if they are shooting at us,&#148; explained Major Joey Broussard 
  of the Louisiana State Fisheries and Wildlife Division. &#147;We don&rsquo;t 
  know who and we don&rsquo;t know why, but we don&rsquo;t want to get in a situation 
  of having to return fire out there,&#148; he said. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Perhaps the 
  most chilling accounts were from hospitals, where staff desperately tried to 
  move patients up stairs as the water rose, while blacks invaded and looted the 
  floors below. Most hospitals had emergency generators, but these began to fail 
  or run out of fuel. Two days after the hurricane, the city had no running water, 
  and as food ran out, doctors and nurses gave themselves intravenous feedings 
  to keep going.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just outside 
  New Orleans, gunmen held up a supply truck carrying food, water, and medical 
  supplies that were on their way to a 203-bed hospital. Patients in hospitals 
  all across the city eventually had to be taken out, but rescuers met resistance. 
  Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Cheri Ben-Iesan told reporters at an emergency headquarters: 
  &#147;Hospitals are trying to evacuate. At every one of them, there are reports 
  that as the helicopters come in people are shooting at them, saying, &lsquo;You 
  better come get my family.&rsquo; &#148; An effort to evacuate patients and staff 
  from Charity Hospital in downtown New Orleans was stopped by sniper fire. Other 
  hospitals reported gangs of looters attacking and overturning ambulances.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Chris Lawrence, 
  a reporter with CNN, filed a report from the roof of a police station: &#147;Right 
  now it&rsquo;s the only safe place to be in the city. We were on the street earlier 
  but the police said under no circumstances would you be safe on the street. 
  They said anybody walking in the streets of New Orleans is basically taking 
  their life in their hands&hellip; . They directed some of the young women to get 
  off the street immediately.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What may have 
  been the most shocking headline of the entire crisis was in the September 2 
  issue of Army Times: &#147;Troops Begin Combat Operations in New Orleans.&#148; 
  The article was about the Louisiana National Guard massing near the Superdome 
  in preparation for a citywide security mission. &#147;This place is going to 
  look like Little Somalia,&#148; Brig. Gen. Gary Jones explained. &#147;We&rsquo;re 
  going to go out and take this city back. This will be a combat operation to 
  get this city under control.&#148; The amphibious assault ship Bataan was in 
  the area, but kept its helicopters on board after pilots reported sniper fire.</font></p>
<div align="left"></div>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Many soldiers 
  came under gunfire from civilians. &#147;I never thought that as a National 
  Guardsman I would be shot at by other Americans,&#148; said Philip Baccus of 
  the 527th Engineer Battalion. &#147;And I never thought I&rsquo;d have to carry 
  a rifle when on a hurricane relief mission. This is a disgrace.&#148; Cliff 
  Ferguson of the same battalion added: &#147;You have to think about whether 
  it is worth risking your neck for someone who will turn around and shoot at 
  you. We didn&rsquo;t come here to fight a war. We came here to help.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Michael Brown, 
  head of FEMA, said: &#147;We are working under conditions of urban warfare.&#148; 
  Lieutenant-General Steven Blum, of the National Guard, said the 7,000 guardsmen 
  arriving in Louisiana would be dedicated to restoring order to New Orleans. 
  He said half of them had just returned from overseas assignments and were &#147;highly 
  proficient in the use of lethal force.&#148; He promised to deal with thugs 
  &#147;in a quick and efficient manner.&#148; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Shoot-to-kill 
  orders were supposed to have gone out, and Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco boasted 
  that battle-hardened veterans would put down the violence in no time. However, 
  there were few accounts of soldiers firing their weapons. The London Times reported 
  that a New Orleans policeman explained through tears that he had seen bodies 
  riddled with bullets, and one man with the top of his head shot off. He said 
  looters were armed with stolen AK-47 rifles, and that the police were outgunned 
  just like in Somalia. &#147;It&rsquo;s a war-zone, and they&rsquo;re [the federal 
  government] not treating it like one,&#148; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We will never 
  know the full extent of the mayhem blacks loosed on their own city. Many victims 
  will not be found for weeks or even months, rotted beyond recognition, their 
  killers never found. Drowned or murdered, the bloated, stinking bodies that 
  turn up by the hundreds will look much the same. In their haste to get cadavers 
  off the streets, the authorities may not worry much about cause of death.</font></p>
<div align="left"></div>
<p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From Hurricane 
  to Jungle</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the two 
  main refugee centers, however&mdash;the Superdome and the Convention Center&mdash;too 
  many people witnessed the degeneracy for it to be ignored. The first refugees 
  had arrived at the Superdome the day before the hurricane, on Sunday, August 
  28. The last finally left the stadium on Saturday, Sept. 3, so some people 
  may have spent nearly a week in what, after the toilets began to overflow, became 
  known as the Sewerdome.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Preparation 
  for refugees was pitifully inadequate. By day, as many as 25,000 people sweltered 
  in temperatures that rose into the 100s. Whatever order had been established 
  soon melted away, and the stadium reverted to the jungle. Young men robbed and 
  raped with impunity. Occasional gunshots panicked the crowd. At least one man 
  committed suicide by sailing off a high deck and splattering onto the playing 
  field. Bodies of the murdered, and of infants and the elderly who died of heat 
  exhaustion began to accumulate. Six babies were born in the stadium. Charles 
  Womack, a 30-year-old roofer, said he saw one man beaten to death, and was, 
  himself beaten with a pipe. Crack addicts&mdash;who had brought their most valuable 
  possession with them&mdash;smoked openly and fought over drugs. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A group of 
  about 30 British students were among the very small number of whites in the 
  stadium, where they spent four harrowing days. Jamie Trout, 22, an economics 
  major, wrote that the scene &#147;was like something out of Lord of the Flies,&#148; 
  with &#147;people shouting racial abuse about us being white.&#148; One night, 
  word came that the power was failing, and that there was only ten minutes&rsquo; 
  worth of gas for the generators. Zoe Smith, 21, from Hull, said they all feared 
  for their lives: &#147;All us girls sat in the middle while the boys sat on 
  the outside, with chairs as protection,&#148; she said. &#147;We were absolutely 
  terrified, the situation had descended into chaos, people were very hostile 
  and the living conditions were horrendous.&#148; She said that even during the 
  day, &#147;when we offered to help with the cleaning, the locals gave us abuse.&#148;</font></p>
<div align="left"></div>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mr. Trout 
  said the National Guard<b> </b>finally recognized how dangerous the threat was 
  from blacks, and moved the British under guard to the basketball area, which 
  was safer. &#147;The army warned us to keep our bags close to us and to grip 
  them tight,&#148; he said, as they were escorted out. Twenty-year-old Jane Wheeldon 
  credited one man in particular, Sgt. Garland Ogden, with getting the Britons 
  safely out. &#147;He went against a lot of rules to get us moved,&#148; she 
  said.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Australian 
  tourists stuck in the Superdome had the same experience. Bud Hopes, a 32-year-old 
  man from Kangaroo Point, Brisbane, took control and may have saved many lives. 
  As the stadium reverted to anarchy he realized whites were in danger, and gathered 
  tourists together for safety. &#147;There were 65 of us altogether so we were 
  able to look after each other, especially the girls who were being grabbed and 
  threatened,&#148; said Mr. Hopes. They organized escorts for women who had to 
  go to the toilet or for food, and set up a roster of men to stand guard while 
  others slept. &#147;We sat through the night just watching each other, not knowing 
  if we would be alive in the morning,&#148; Mr. Hopes said. &#147;Ninety-eight 
  percent of the people around the world are good,&#148; he said; &#147;in that 
  place 98 per cent of the people were bad.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">John McNeil 
  of Coorparoo in Brisbane tells what happened to their group, too, heard the 
  lights were about to go out: &#147;I looked at Bud [Hopes] and said, &lsquo;That 
  will be the end of us.&rsquo; The gangs had already eyed us off. If the lights 
  had gone out we would have been in deep trouble. We were sitting there praying 
  for a miracle and the lights stayed on.&#148; Mr. Hopes said the Australians 
  owed their lives to a National Guardsman who broke the rules and got whites 
  out to a medical center past seething crowds of blacks. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Peter McNeil 
  of Brisbane told the Australian AP that his son John was one of the 65 who managed 
  to get out. The blacks were reportedly so hostile &#147;they would stab you 
  as soon as look at you.&#148; &#147;He&rsquo;s never been so scared in his life,&#148; 
  explained Mr. McNeil. &#147;He just said they had to get out of the dark. Otherwise, 
  another night, he said, they would have been gone.&#148; No American newspaper 
  wrote about what these white tourists had gone through.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When guardsmen 
  began to show up in force on Sept. 1 and take control, some blacks met them 
  with cheers, but others shouted obscenities at them. Capt. John Pollard of the 
  Texas Air National Guard said 20,000 people were in the dome when the 
  evacuation began, but thousands more appeared from surrounding areas when word 
  got out that there were buses leaving town. Soldiers held their M-16s and grenade-launchers at the
  ready, and kept a sharp eye out for snipers.</font></p>
<div align="left"></div>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">That same 
  day, when it was time to board buses for Houston, soldiers had trouble controlling 
  the crowd. People at the back of the mob crushed the people in front against 
  barricades the soldiers put up to contain the crowd. Many people continued to 
  yell obscenities whenever they saw a patrol go by. Some were afraid of losing 
  their place in line and defecated where they stood. The Army Times reported

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By the evening 
  of Sept. 3, the Superdome was finally evacuated, but the state-of-the-art stadium 
  was a reeking cavern of filth, human waste, and an unknown number of corpses. 
  It, too, had been looted of everything not bolted down. Janice Singleton was 
  working at the stadium when the storm hit. She said she was robbed of everything 
  she had, including her shoes. As for the building: &#147;They tore that dome 
  apart,&#148; she said sadly. &#147;They tore it down. They taking everything 
  out of there they can take.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If anything, 
  conditions were worse at the Convention Center. Although on high ground not 
  far from the stadium, it had not been designated as a shelter. It was, however, 
  beyond reach of the high water, and soon some 20,000 people were huddled in 
  its cavernous halls. There were no supplies or staff, and for several days neither 
  FEMA nor the National Guard seems to have known anyone was there. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Armed gangs 
  took control, and occasional gunshots caused panic. There was no power, and 
  at night the center was plunged into complete darkness. Degeneracy struck almost 
  immediately, with rapes, robbery, and murder. Terrible shrieking tore through 
  the night, but no one could see or dared to move. When Police Chief Eddie Compass 
  heard what was happening, he sent a squad of 88 officers to investigate. They 
  were overwhelmed by superior forces and retreated, leaving thousands to the 
  mercy of criminals. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It was not 
  until Sept. 2&mdash;four days after the hurricane&mdash;that a force of 1,000 
  National Guardsmen finally took over from the armed gangs. &#147;Had we gone 
  in with a lesser force we may have been challenged, innocents may have been 
  caught in a fight between the guard and military police and those who did not

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sitting with 
  her daughter and other relatives, Trolkyn Joseph, 37, told a reporter that men 
  had wandered the center at night raping and murdering children. She said she 
  found a dead 14-year old girl at 5 a.m. on Friday morning, four hours after 
  the girl went missing. &#147;She was raped for four hours until she was dead,&#148; 
  Miss Joseph said through tears. &#147;Another child, a seven-year old boy, was 
  found raped and murdered in the kitchen freezer last night.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Africa Brumfield, 
  32, explained that women were in particular fear: &#147;There is rapes going 
  on here. Women cannot go to the bathroom without men. They are raping them and 
  slitting their throats.&#148; Donald Anderson, 43, was at the convention center 
  with his wife who was six months pregnant: &#147;We circled the chairs like 
  wagons because at night there are stampedes,&#148; he said. &#147;We had to 
  survive.&#148;</font></p>
<div align="left"></div>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The very few 
  whites in the crowd were terrified. Eighty-year-old Selma Valenti, who was with 
  her husband, said blacks threatened to kill them on Thursday, Sept. 1. &#147;They 
  hated us. Four young black men told us the buses were going to come last night 
  and pick up the elderly so they were going to kill us,&#148; she said, sobbing. 
  Presumably, the blacks wanted to take their places on the buses.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The center 
  was not entirely without a form of rough justice. A National Guardsman reported 
  that a man who had raped and killed a young girl in the bathroom was caught 
  by the crowd&mdash;which beat him to death.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At one time 
  there were as many as seven or eight corpses in front of the center, some of 
  them with blood streaming from bullet wounds. Inside, there was an emergency 
  morgue, but a National Guardsman refused to let a Reuters photographer in to 
  take pictures. &#147;We&rsquo;re not letting anyone in there anymore,&#148; he 
  said. &#147;If you want to take pictures of dead bodies, go to Iraq.&#148; By 
  Saturday, Sept. 3, the center was mostly cleared of the living. Refugees pulled 
  shirts over their noses trying to block out the smell as they walked past rotting 
  bodies. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By the weekend, 
  there were an estimated 50,000 soldiers and federal rescue workers in the city, 
  but even the massive presence did not bring calm. On Sunday, Sept. 4, contractors 
  working for the US Army Corps of Engineers came under fire. Their police escort 
  returned fire, in what became a running gun battle. Deputy Police Chief W.J. 
  Riley said police killed four of the attackers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By Saturday, 
  police had set up a temporary booking and detention center at the New Orleans 
  train station. State Attorney General Charles Foti said there were plans for 
  a temporary court system, but no one knew how they were going to assemble juries 
  or call witnesses. The grim business began of combing the drowning city for 
  corpses and the remaining survivors.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Reactions</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The world 
  reacted with astonishment to sights it never expected to see in the United States. 
  &#147;Anarchy in the USA,&#148; read the headline in Britain&rsquo;s best-selling 
  newspaper, The Sun. &#147;Apocalypse Now,&#148; said Handelsblatt in Germany. 
  Mario de Carvalho, a veteran Portuguese cameraman, who has covered the world&rsquo;s 
  trouble spots, said he saw the bodies of babies and old people along the highways 
  leading out of New Orleans. &#147;It&rsquo;s a chaotic situation. It&rsquo;s terrible. 
  It&rsquo;s a situation we generally see in other countries, in the Third World,&#148; 
  he said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The comparison 
  would have been insulting to some Third-Worlders. &#147;I am absolutely disgusted,&#148; 
  said Sajeewa Chinthaka, 36, of the looters. The Sri Lanka native added: &#147;After 
  the tsunami our people, even the ones who lost everything, wanted to help the 
  others who were suffering. Not a single tourist caught in the tsunami was mugged. 
  Now with all this happening in the U.S. we can easily see where the civilized 
  part of the world&rsquo;s population is.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the United 
  States, the stark contrast between endless scenes of appalling behavior by blacks 
  and rescue personnel who were almost all white was greeted with the standard 
  foolishness. Some people accused the &#147;biased&#148; media of suppressing 
  footage of rampaging whites and heroic black helicopter pilots. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Most blacks 
  made excuses for looters. &#147;Desperate people do desperate things,&#148; 
  said U.S. Rep. Diane Watson of California. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., Democrat 
  from Illinois, said we must not judge harshly: &#147;Who are we to say what 
  law and order should be in this unspeakable environment?&#148; Rep. Melvin Watt, 
  North Carolina Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, was 
  perhaps the greatest ass of all: &#147;Whatever is being taken could not be 
  used by anyone else anyway,&#148; he said. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Many blacks 
  took it for granted that federal relief was slow because the victims were black. 
  Rep. Elijah Cummings said &#147;poverty, age and skin color&#148; determined 
  who lived and who died. Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP&rsquo;s Washington 
  bureau, blasted &#147;disparate treatment&#148; of Katrina victims. &#147;Many 
  black people feel that their race, their property conditions and their voting 
  patterns have been a factor in the response,&#148; explained Jesse Jackson, 
  Sr. He said the rubbish outside the Convention Center made the place look &#147;like 
  the hull of a slave ship.&#148; Black activist and reparations-booster Randall 
  Robinson said the relief effort was the &#147;defining watershed moment in America&rsquo;s 
  racial history.&#148; He said he had &#147;finally come to see my country for 
  what it really is. A monstrous fraud.&#148; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">U.S. Rep. 
  Carolyn Kilpatrick said she was &#147;ashamed of America and &hellip; of our government.&#148; 
  The mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin,<b> </b>shouted and wept on local radio, demanding 
  of federal officials: &#147;Get off your asses, and let&rsquo;s do something,&#148; 
  (and gave city workers a vacation when the feds arrived). There was an undercurrent 
  of fury at a meeting of black leaders in Detroit. One audience member wanted 
  to know whether the slow federal response was &#147;black genocide.&#148; Another 
  shouted, &#147;African Americans built this nation. Descendants of slaves are 
  being allowed to die.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One black 
  man, observing the chaos from abroad, took a different view. Leighton Levy wrote 
  in the Sept. 2 Jamaica Star: &#147;I am beginning to believe that black people, 
  no matter where in the world they are, are cursed with a genetic predisposition 
  to steal, murder, and create mayhem.&#148; He wanted to know why there was no 
  footage of white looters: &#147;Is it that the media are not showing pictures 
  of them looting and robbing? Or is it that they are too busy trying to stay 
  alive, waiting to be rescued, and hiding from the blacks?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Most blacks 
  and many whites fell into the usual assumptions about omnipotent white government 
  and helpless Negroes. If black people were suffering it was because whites had 
  not done enough for them. It did not occur to them that it was the responsibility 
  of New Orleans and the state of Louisiana&mdash;not the federal government&mdash;to 
  prepare for hurricanes. Before the storm hit, Mayor Nagin issued a mandatory 
  evacuation only under pressure from the Bush administration. The mayor then 
  did nothing to enforce the order, leaving hundreds of city buses and school 
  buses to drown rather than use them to offer transportation to people without 
  cars. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Something 
  of the mood of black New Orleans was caught by Fox News film crews as late as 
  Sunday, Sept. 4. White volunteers were trying to persuade a black woman and 
  her small children to leave her flooded house. &#147;You&rsquo;ve got to get 
  out,&#148; they explained. &#147;The water isn&rsquo;t going away.&#148; A black 
  man at the top of a multi-story building told a helicopter crew he didn&rsquo;t 
  need to leave. All he needed was some supplies. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">These people 
  could not understand something that was obvious to the whole world: New Orleans 
  had no electricity, no plumbing, no transport, and no food. Blacks refused to 
  leave their flooded homes, even though to stay meant near-certain death.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Homeland Security 
  chief Michael Chertoff noted how crazy it was to stay in the wreckage. &#147;That 
  is not a reasonable alternative,&#148; he said. &#147;We are not going to be 
  able to have people sitting in houses in the city of New Orleans for weeks and 
  months while we de-water and clean this city.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">FEMA reported 
  that it had pulled three Carnival Cruise Lines ships from commercial duty to 
  shelter the blacks of New Orleans. Maybe the chance of berth on the Ecstasy, 
  the Sensation or the Holiday would be enough to drag them out of the muck.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lessons</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ninety-nine 
  percent of the white people left New Orleans when the evacuation order went 
  out. Some 80,000 blacks could not or would not leave. Whites did not &#147;leave 
  them behind,&#148; as the editorial-writers keep telling us. No one could have 
  gotten some of them to leave, but if it was anyone&rsquo;s job to give them the 
  option, it was that of the black-run city government. Of the blacks who stayed, 
  probably only a minority committed crimes, but they were enough to turn the 
  city into a hell hole. Some did unspeakable things: loot hospitals, fire on 
  rescue teams, destroy ambulances. No amount of excuse-making and finger-pointing 
  can paper over degeneracy like that. Black people&mdash;and only black people&mdash;did 
  these things.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Superdome 
  and the Convention Center were certainly unpleasant places to spend three or 
  four days, but 50,000 whites would have behaved completely differently. They 
  would have established rules, organized supplies, cared for the sick and dying. 
  They would have organized games for children. The papers would be full of stories 
  of selflessness and community spirit. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Natural disasters 
  usually bring out the best in people. They help neighbors and strangers alike. 
  For blacks&mdash;at least the lower-class blacks of New Orleans&mdash;disaster 
  was an excuse to loot, rob, rape and kill. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our rulers 
  and media executives will try to turn the story of Hurricane Katrina into yet 
  another morality tale of downtrodden blacks and heartless whites, but pandering 
  of this kind fools fewer and fewer people. Many whites will realize&mdash;some 
  for the first time&mdash;that we have Africa in our midst, that utterly alien 
  Africa of road-side corpses, cruelty, and anarchy that they thought could never 
  wash up on our shores. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To be sure, 
  the story of Hurricane Katrina does have a moral for anyone not deliberately 
  blind. The races are different. Blacks and whites are different. When blacks 
  are left entirely to their own devices, Western Civilization&mdash;any kind of 
  civilization&mdash;disappears. And in a crisis, civilization disappears overnight.</font></p>

<p>Then they see the blacks on TV looting and they get there answer. Its funny because the people in Japan for example are shocked about this event. Then they see that pretty much only the blacks are causing the problems and they are no longer shocked. </p>

					<p>It is excellent that Jarred Taylor put so much directly factual information in one place. It&rsquo;s <span class="caps">URL </span>can be put in many places on the internet.</p>
<p>Moral 1. We, and by that I include the press, government, and academia, need to be more truthful and factual about the differences among genomic population groups.</p>
<p>Moral 2. As powerless as we feel at times, the reality is that the world is so unhinged from so many different directions, that surprises can appear that will change the world in ways we cannot imagine, and that will overwhelm all the forces that seek to create the reality-denying, life-denying universe that envelopes us and that flows from the shallow, mislead ideas in the heads of the people who push so hard to create these fake realities.</p>

					<p>When I learned of what happened in New Orleans I immediatly thought I would make for a good AR article and thought about e-mailing AR this tip. How foolish of me, of course this was realised there too. I knew I could count on you Mr.Taylor and I just want you to know you can count on me too! Gosh, everytime that I see Bush I think to myself &#8220;How great would it be if Jared Taylor could be <span class="caps">U.S.</span> President!*&#8221;. </p>
<p>But returning to the topic at hand, I think we can safely say that this whole NO episode is, for our point of view, as valuable as the LA race riots of 1992 were, by which I mean that it has opened up more White eyes to the racial realities of the contemporary United States.   </p>

					<p>God sent Katrina to wake up whites.  I weep for those (Aussies, Brits and others) who suffered so at the hands of blacks, but the net result for our people is that even white liberals are starting to get tired of &#8220;it&rsquo;s whitey&rsquo;s fault.&#8221; Hopefully, the mental seeds planted will begin to sprout.</p>

					<p>I saw a TV report from the Astrodome in Houston, <span class="caps">TX, </span>last Saturday. White volunteers were working hard to accomodate those just evacuated from New Orleans, not sparing any effort in order to take the best care of the refugees possible. Meanwhile, predominantly black refugees, many of them young, strong, healthy and well fed (some of them definitely too well fed), were just walking around, talking on cell phones, smoking, joking, eating, laying down, trying to kill time. They expected all the help to be given to them as some kind of entitlement and apparently didn&rsquo;t think they should somehow participate in the effort. They didn&rsquo;t even pick after themselves, expecting that it was someone else&rsquo;s job to clean up. Their black leaders, both elected and self-appointed, weren&rsquo;t any better either. They just complained lauder and demanded help more aggressively. </p>
<p>This was a real eye opener for me. I will never again buy the liberal cow manure about poverty among blacks being allegedly caused by slavery and racial discrimination. Because what I have seen tels me that generous welfare and race-based privileges nurture parasitic attitudes among so many blacks, which makes them even less likely to survive on their own without heavy subsidies. An organism or a society may live with parasites but when there is hardly anyone else but parasites then the live ceases to exist. We saw it in New Orleans Super Dome. </p>
<p>I also saw the other day a black couple sitting on the roof of their flooded home in New Orleans and waving a huge American flag while waiting to be rescued. This somehow moved me to tears. We need to be careful and not throw the good ones, like these two, into the same category with the bad or unfit ones.<br>

					<p>I guess my main feeling with blacks is that I just wish they would go away to some country where we would not have to be burdened by them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the savages looting and raping in New Orleans. It is the racist black leadership that blames every single black failing on whites. On the flip side I cannot remember one instance of a black leader thanking whites for the billions of dollars and special help we give to them. Nor will they thank us now for saving them and rebuilding their lives. Of course, most of our white leadership goes along meekly with this. They are terrified of speaking a truth they know in their bones. Thus for the truth on race we have to read AR or wait for an occasional honest black like Leighton Levy or Walter Williams.</p>
<p>But I think it is all related. Racist blacks in high places are very embarrassed by the actions of their racial kinsmen. They know it is their own fault but in their rage they lash out at the easiest and most convenient scapegoats - whites and sometimes Asians.</p>
<p>So we have some of the least intelligent and most burdensome blacks in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>being saved by whites (who are often volunteering and risking their own lives). Moreover, whites are giving millions - perhaps billions - to save black people. And then we have racist rappers like Kanye West (his mother was a Black Panther - could he have been anything but a pathetic racist?) blaming Bush and whites in general.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that whites will one day stop taking the garbage blacks give us on a daily basis. Hispanics and other non-white groups do not blame themselves for black failure and do not lift a finger to help blacks. During the LA riots both Hispanics and even Asians fought back against blacks. Only we took the beatings and blamed ourselves.</p>
<p>Maybe this will help more whites open their eyes and get off their knees.</p>
<p>Oh, and God bless those white Aussie and English tourists for organizaing and keeping their women from getting raped and killed by black racists. Would white American men do the same?</p>

					<p>I think a growing number of whites and other minorities (other than blacks) will begin to reconsider after what&rsquo;s been happening in New Orleans the kind of ridiculous, &#8220;limousine liberal&#8221; arguments about white guilt and black innocence that have been used so long to explain every failure of black culture and society within the United States.</p>
<p>A growing number of people will realize that the arguments in favor of racial integration between blacks and whites no longer hold up to reality.</p>

					<p>Thank you Mr. Taylor. This article is incredible and I am going to make sure every open-minded person I know gets a copy.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;An estimated 200 officers just walked off the job. They indicated that they had lost everything and didn&rsquo;t feel that it was worth them going back to take fire from looters and losing their lives.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>White and blacks are different indeed. Just imagine if the the (almost all white) firefighters of the <span class="caps">NYFD </span>acted the way the black police officers in <span class="caps">N.O. </span>did. Take a moment to realize the huge diffence in behavior during a crisis of (white) Mayor Guiliani and (black) Mayor Nagin.</p>
<p>See the contrast: On September 11, 2001, <span class="caps">NYFD </span>(mostly all white) firefighters, even on their days off, went to ground zero to toil non-stop day and night for weeks to help.<br>
&#8220;Mayor Ray Nagin offered to pay for the entire [almost all black] police force, firefighters, and city emergency workers to go on five-day vacations&hellip; that his men &#8216;have been through a lot.&rsquo;&rdquo; The facts are clear as day. Not even <span class="caps">CNN </span>can spin this.</p>
<p>As I have written previously on Amren: Blacks have yet to prove themselves positive contributors in American soceity.<br>

					<p>Great article Mr. Taylor.  With so many people watching and reading it will be impossible for the media to spin their usual tales of racism and woe&hellip;although they are trying. Mightily. </p>
<p>The looting and barbarity are bad enough but when you juxtapose it with the behavior of the poor whites in Mississippi the behavior of the blacks in <span class="caps">N.O. </span>is even more jaw dropping. Can&rsquo;t wait for gun sales to spike.  This is going to be an <span class="caps">O.J. </span>verdict -like event for many whites I think.</p>

					<p>If there are people out there who believe events happen for a reason (as I do), Hurricane Katrina was an omen of sorts. It has done more to open the eyes of PC-blinded, multicultural-brainwashed people around the world than any amount of preaching from AmRen or like sites could ever accomplish.</p>
<p>This force of Nature has truly prompted The Wake-Up Call, to many, many, who have been asleep or paralyzed by decades of leftist propaganda.</p>
<p>A picture (or video) does indeed tell a thousand words.</p>

The Marxists, leftists, and &ldquo;progressives&rdquo; will use this as irrevocable proof and propaganda of what white Americans think of black Americans; that whites would abandon blacks in their hour of desperation because they are racists.</p>
<p>However, readers of American Renaissance know what we are witnessing. What we are seeing is the expression of genes. When the chips are down and the thin protective veil of civilization is removed, even temporarily, blacks always show themselves as they truly are.</p>
<p>It was no surprise that blacks and their apologists came out swinging. Within hours of the first images that were broadcast on our television sets around the nation and the world, blacks were working overtime to draw attention from how blacks were behaving to how whites were failing to save blacks from themselves. </p>
<p>I have said this over and over. It is pointless to try to help blacks. It is a lose-lose situation. Regardless of what you do, you will be faulted in the end in ways you can not imagine in the moment. That is why I do everything I can to not be around blacks when I can.</p>
<p>As I write this, I&rsquo;m watching <span class="caps">FOX </span>news and they are showing whites evacuating. They are not standing around crying or screaming in anger or faulting others for what they know they have to do for themselves. They are all working to save themselves and their property and to even help the strangers around them. For me, this comes as no surprise. Blacks expect <span class="caps">WHITE </span>people to save them. White people save themselves. </p>
<p>The media can quickly and easily find fault with Bush in Washington but they find no fault in the black Mayor Nagin in New Orleans. They tell us &lsquo;Bush should have known&rsquo; but no one asks &lsquo;why didn&rsquo;t Mayor Nagin use the now flooded school buses to remove people before the flood or at least move them to higher ground until they could be used later?&rsquo; The only answer they can come up with is that whites are evil racists and blacks are innocent victims. And this is at odd with the images because most of the rescue workers appear to be white.</p>
<p>And can you imagine if the water had reached the Superdome and saturated the foundation and cause it to fall in on itself? Right now the Mayor is being congratulated for getting everyone to the shelter of the Superdome but what if the Superdome structure had failed? Would Mr. Nagin be blamed? More than likely the engineers and contractors would be made to stand trial in The Hague for crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t live in New Orleans and I didn&rsquo;t follow the mayors race, I&rsquo;m fairly certain that the black candidates sited their blackness as the reason why they should be in charge of the city. They more than likely spoke of how only &ldquo;they&rdquo; knew what their problems were and only &ldquo;they&rdquo; knew how to solve them. Now &ldquo;they&rdquo; reap what &ldquo;they&rdquo; sow.</p>
<p>The white gay blogger Andrew Sullivan and white straight columnist Jimmy Breslin, as have many other white writers, have told us white people were the problem; that they knew what was going to happen and yet they held back; that they knew what needed to be done but did not act in a quick and timely manner; that had the victims been white, the response would have been different.</p>
<p>The only thing we can be sure of is that had the victims been white, the <span class="caps">OUTCOME </span>would be different. </p>
<p>I would disagree with Mr. Taylor regarding the point of leaving or staying (although I&rsquo;m sure we would agree). If your home (private or public) is submerged then you have no choice but to leave (anyone living on a rooftop waiting for the water to subside is having a great deal of difficulty dealing with reality). However, there are homes in areas where the water has subsided and people are trying to save and salvage what they can but are being given only hours to return and leave.</p>
<p>Rather than use a cookie cutter approach, I would favor a more individual approach to evaluate each neighborhood. Certainly some are beyond hope but others are less affected and the white people who want to return are probably very capable of bringing the supplies they need for the time they need to stay and then to leave when they complete their mission.</p>
<p>And as always, a great assessment from Mr. Taylor.</p>

					<p>A white person who lives near a large concentration of blacks is like a camper who pitches his tent near a hornet&rsquo;s nest. As long as the nest stays intact, all he may only get an occasional sting.  That&rsquo;s unpleasant enough, but if something comes along and destroys the nest he&rsquo;s going to be in a world of hurt.</p>

					<p>I fear that the truth of the situation will never be known to  mainstream America due to the taboo territory into which the press will never dare enter.  The loss of money from TV sponsorship, the threat of boycott, and the many other forms of extortion open to the PC crowd, will keep Mr. and Mrs. Puddin&rsquo;head in the dark.

					<p>I actually agree with racist buffoon Randall Robinson.  The past week has, indeed, been a &#8220;watershed&#8221;.</p>
<p>The New Orleans fiasco has taught the youngest generation of White Americans what blacks are about.  For two generations, White kids have been indoctrinated with all sorts of &#8220;love thy noble neighbor&#8221; diversity baloney about blacks.  Many kids bought into this while, inside their hearts, many also did not.</p>
<p>Young Whites who often heard their grandparents tell them how animalistic and uncivilized blacks are when left to their own devices now know that grandpa was <span class="caps">RIGHT.</span></p>
<p>Perhaps a word of thanks should go out to those looters, thugs, and rapists who opened the eyes of impressionable White kids.<br>
They now know the truth about American blacks.</p>
<p>As well, these youngsters should grow up boycotting anything black-organized or black-dominated.  I, for one, will no longer visit any city &#8220;governed (in the very losest sense)&#8221; by blacks.  I went to N. O. in 2002 and 2003 but will never return unless regime change takes place.</p>
<p>To paraphrase one writer, &#8220;When I see it&rsquo;s black, I don&rsquo;t go back&#8221;.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t deserve the attention, money, or time of day from Whites.  Don&rsquo;t let them get a foot in your door and don&rsquo;t even come close to their door.  <br>

					<p>Unfortunately, the sort of violence that Mr. Taylor has described will be left out when the story of New Orleans is told from now on. That is, except among people who like to hear the truth. Other, more casual, observers won&rsquo;t think about it anymore. That&rsquo;s just the way it is. We can cry about it all we want, but it won&rsquo;t change a thing.</p>
<p>Now that that&rsquo;s been said&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that this situation has started up a new debate on race relations in this country. If anyone hands me that line in the future, I&rsquo;m going to inform that person that I don&rsquo;t take part in scripted debates. No matter what you feel about this or any other racially charged situation, can we please just dispense with the faux soul searching bit, because we&rsquo;re all just tired of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that coverage of Mississippi has seen a huge drop since the whole &#8220;poor and black&#8221; crowd begam to raise their voices. Well, the southern third of the state has been virtually blown away, but <span class="caps">CNN </span>has apparently decided that those people just don&rsquo;t exist. I guess the population of Mississippi south of Jackson just isn&rsquo;t black enough to warrant the kind of attention that poor and black New Orleans has gotten.</p>

					<p>In response to apalled and horrified-</p>
<p> You are &#8216;apalled and horrified&rsquo; when someone spells out the truth but not by the truth itself? So those pictures are lies? Are they airbrushed by the racist white man? Those are really bags of groceries being looted, airbrushed to look like <span class="caps">TV&rsquo;</span>s. Let me guess, the storm threw the bricks through the windows. Those are fireworks, not gunshots. <br>
 Why don&rsquo;t you take in one of the unfortunate blacks? Put your phoney money where your phoney mouth is. <br><br>
Sure, you sent a check to a relief fund. That was nice of you, 50 bucks I&rsquo;ll bet. <br><br>
 Yeah, yeah, you are far more cultured than us racist Amren posters. You have a friend who knew a black guy in school and he said he was a nice guy. Maybe the black guy working at your starbucks is a friendly fellow, makes your mocha just right. <br><br>
You shouldn&rsquo;t have sent the 50 bucks, you could have re-upped your Ebony subscription. <br><br>
 Now, now you swish, I&rsquo;m just playin&rsquo; with ya&hellip;friends&hellip;right? You&rsquo;re a open-minded fellow, learned up just right in your university. You should accept me as I am&hellip;&rsquo;tolerate&rsquo; me.</p>

					<p>An excellent article by Mr. Taylor - one of his best ever.</p>
<p>I sense the mood of the nation isn&rsquo;t so bad, people are shrugging off the horrors of New Orleans saying &#8220;what do you expect&#8221; - that&rsquo;s how this other part of America, this Africa in America behaves. I think very few Whites will listen to the usual types moan and grown about how it&rsquo;s all White racist society&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>For those of you who might see some White folks falling for the media spin that Blacks in New Orleans were &#8220;victims&#8221; not &#8220;criminals please show them my music video:</p>
<p>http://media.putfile.com/tellmelies1</p>
<p>We should crank up this theme song &#8220;Tell me Lies&#8221; by the Brit group Fleetwood Mac whenever anyone in the Lib/Minority media starts pushing the spin that Black looters, rapists, killers are &#8220;victims&#8221; and we (Whites) are all to blame.</p>

					<p>Fury, allow me to add: One of the most despicable sights to the Japanese I know was the black parents (or more precisely, the mothers, since a black father or &#8220;baby daddy&#8221; rearing his own children is almost non-existent) bringing their children along to join in the looting spree.  </p>
<p>The Japanese would concede that looting for basic sustenance in a bonafide crisis is justified, even under the strictest interpretation of a Confucian-based moral code.  However, just as a devout white Christian might ask God&rsquo;s forgiveness in advance of committing such an act, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine a Japanese going about such a grim task quietly and alone, with  murmured apologies to his dead ancestors (and the looted goods owner).  That these black mothers were of such low character as to actually bring their children along and gleefully encourage them to fill a shopping cart with stolen cookies, candies and soda pop, is an unspeakable breech of the moral law in the eyes of the Japanese, not to mention a complete failure in parenting.       </p>

					<p>Katrina will be a watershed in American race relations.  No one in his or her right mind except the most pityfull liberal apologist will excuse much less forget the savagery perpetrated by the blacks of New Orleans.<br>
Yes, this will be a turning point.  Mark my words.  Amercians are sick unto death of black lawlessness and savagery.  They&rsquo;re sick unto to death of the black mantra &#8220;Oh, Lawdy, po&rsquo; black me!&#8221;  They&rsquo;re sick of blacks not taking responsibility for their own behavior and destiny.  They&rsquo;re sick of such moronic rationals that suggest that the Hurricane was somehow aimed at blacks and that the resulting tragedy was the fault of the big bad white man.<br><br>
As bad as this hurricane was, in that sense it was a good thing for the cause of the inherent differences between white people and black people.<br><br>

<p>Then why do you bother to post a comment if you&rsquo;re really not too concerned?</p>
<p>And, how can you arrive at the conclusion that a strictly repertorial account is a fabrication, when even somebody like a Michael Moore wouldn&rsquo;t deny that, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Probably you are a left wing ideologue who has been brainwashed and propagandized to the point where you believe any criticism of blacks is vile and untruthful, because you can&rsquo;t think for yourself anymore than any other programmed robot.</p>
<p>And, if you are black, well, you have to understand that it is difficult for you to understand anything, because if you have average black <span class="caps">I.Q. </span>it is only 85, which in my book is borderline mentally retarded.</p>
<p>Somebody like you should be studied to determine why you regard the truth as vile filth, so that we might better understand the people who make up the lower tiers of our society.</p>

<p>Once again, you are another cookie cutter example of one of those self loathing guilt feeling liberal whites who gets all your news and opinions from <span class="caps">MSM, </span>and has no real life practical experience living with blacks and other minorities.  Judging from your e-mail address, I would venture to say you live far from any of them.  It&rsquo;s easy for you to sit in judgment of many of us here on this website.  Most, if not all of us, have many years of up close and personal living with blacks and well understand their behavior.  I&rsquo;ll bet that&rsquo;s not the case with you.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes, those who live in glass houses shouldn&rsquo;t throw stones.  I&rsquo;ll go one step further and say, don&rsquo;t you dare judge me or anyone else here until you&rsquo;ve walked a mile in our shoes.

					<p>This was a horrible human tragedy and it hurt me to see the elderly and good Black families who were victimized at the most desperate time of need. The usual suspects in the media and race industry said what was probably expected.Points they cannot contest are-<br>
1. Mayor Nagin failed to properly evacuate, left school and city buses idle while residents ignored the pending danger and even perhaps stayed behind to commit opportunistic crimes.<br><br>
2.The Jacksons and Sharptons and a host of other Black organizations critical of the government response offered no pre-storm help. These are the people who drag invalids and winos to the polls in November, but could not assist in helping save their lives.<br><br>
3.Many young men in the city who could have risen to heroic greatness chose to use their backs carrying TVs and other looted bounty than carrying their own neighbors to higher ground.<br><br>
4.The police force while facing tremendous pressure folded in great numbers, unlike the brave responders on September 11th.</p>
<p>This could have been a tragedy turned into an historic showing of courage and selflessness. Many persons of all colors did rise to the occassion. Many enough though proved themselves far less than noble.</p>

					<p>Great article. This article balances the ooze of liberalism I see on <span class="caps">TV.</span> Genetics is truth. White people would have acted differently, as history shows they do. Black people, as a whole, are a burden to Western civilization and advancement. If America didn&rsquo;t have to pay for all the welfare/food stamps/govt aid to the minority in this country, our space program would have taken us to colonization of Mars by now. The descendents of the Europeans who built America would not be in slave-debt, and would have adequate medical care, and so on. Our country would be a lot better without the monkey on our back, pun intended. All I ask is when Europeans, Asians, even people in the Middle East read about the behavior of &#8220;Americans&#8221; in New Orleans, remember there is a difference between white and black Americans, big differences.</p>

					<p>[b]What would be interesting to learn, what is the origin of these Blacks. Are they the descendants of the slaves, or are they imported from Haiti, or Somalia or some other place?[/b]</p>
<p>If not too many came from outside Louisiana, they are mainly from the French colonies of La Martinique, La Guadeloupe, and Saint-Domingue (Haiti). Therefore their stock should be mainly Dahomey (voodoo practices) and Congo.</p>
<p>These types are still existing in Caribbean nations and America today. For example, Maulana Karenga (inventor of Kwanzaa) has a typically Congolese skull (flat - receding forehead). <span class="caps">MLK </span>looks somewhat Congolese too.<br>
http://deptorg.knox.edu/newsarchive/news_events/2002/karenga_lecture.html</p>
<p>Jesse Jackson looks Cameronese/Nigerian (more forehead). Eddie Murphy seems to have features from Dahomey (longer face). There have been a lot of mixing with other Blacks, and sometimes other races (like for Farrakhan and many of your Black politicians), but you can train yourself by looking to people from Africa on <span class="caps">TV.</span> Also, generally speaking, the more you go north in the western half of the continent since the Congo river, the more the back of their skull is proeminent, and the upper is the hairline. Of course, there are many exceptions that blur the picture.<br>
Most of the times, differences among pure Africains are as obvious as between an Irish and a Spanish when you pay attention. So while many mixings occurred between Blacks in America, and sometimes other races, great lines are still distinguishable. The crowd of New Orleans on TV was majority Central-African in my opinion, and remarkably unmixed with Whites or Indians. Central Africans are quite warlike. Western Africans say they are hunters, thus they are happy with a good game or a good catch, and don&rsquo;t plane further. But it would be a too quick thought to associate the cliché with the looters.</p>
<p>Most of the pictures go from north to south here:<br>

					<p>Powerful and penetrating words. New Orleans was another chilling warning to the Western world; but does the Western world listen? That people refuse to open their eyes is the real tragedy. White people everywhere should be unnerved by the savagery and brutality displayed once civil order evaporated.</p>
<p>Contrast Black New Orleans with the plight of poor White Mississippians, who braved devastation with typical White restraint and self-organizational skills. Glaring evidence of real racial differenes. </p>
<p>But, White America&rsquo;s conditioning runs deep. Too much fear, too much denial&hellip;&hellip;Too much guilt. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, as the future of the West grows darker, and Whites are confronted by an increasingly hostile non-White majority, they will seek out a voice that represents them. </p>

					<p> New Orleans is a parable of what happens, not only to whites, but to blacks also, when the white population of an area dips below critical mass-Zimbabwe and South Africa are other examples.

<p>Well Whitey, it ain&rsquo;t enough that you shelter, feed, school (thru college), and employ (okay, this is optional) blacks.  It is also your responsibility to ride to their rescue when natural disaster strikes, to save them from nature as well as themselves.  And you&rsquo;d better be quick about it lest you be called &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this a kind of &#8216;White Man&rsquo;s Burden&rsquo; redux?  I mean, when things go bad for blacks, like in New Orleans or with <span class="caps">AIDS </span>in Africa, who&rsquo;s supposed to ride to their rescue?  Why, that&rsquo;s you, Whitey.  We&rsquo;ve become the servants of the blacks; and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what Kipling had in mind.</p>

					<p>Apalled and Horrified:<br>
You say that this article is false, but what about it is untrue? In addition to misspelling many words, you fail to dispute any of the statements that Taylor&rsquo;s article makes. Like so many liberals and race-blind individuals, you are unable to offer any arguments against the crushing weight of racial reality. Unfortunately for you, the tide is turning against you and your ilk, for I and countless other whites   &mdash;   because of events like these   &mdash;   are now possessed of an invincible conviction about the reality of race.</p>

					<p>  Every black in America should fall on his or her knees and thank providence that his ancestors were captured and put on a slave ship headed for America. If not, every day for you would be New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina! Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans is, like his many black predecessors in office, merely a minor-league Robert Mugabe. Blacks who can manage to live parasitically in a majority-white nation are the most fortunate of their breed-especially in America, where we kow-tow to them like royalty. I&rsquo;m waiting for the white government leader who will publicly tell Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton to stuff a sock in it! This is what you get when you insist on electing your own kind to govern you-stop looking for the white man to bail you out! The fable of the grasshopper and the ant comes to mind.</p>

					<p>I was on the elavator at my apartment on Labor Day evening.  The door opened and two couples were waiting to get on.  Both of the women were big beautiful Germanic blondes.  One was snuggling up against a big black guy and looking very self-righteous.  He knew he looked very out of place.  I instinctively felt like asking the race traitor if her father knew what she was doing, but then, I simply smiled and said &#8220;what floor would you like?&#8221;  Don&rsquo;t you get it!  Our paradise was lost on 30 April 1945.               </p>

					<p>I lived in teh US for 15 years prior to returning home to Australia. I purely and simply love America. If it was a woman I would have married her long ago.</p>
<p>The problem I see here my friends is that there seems to be alot of complaining about blacks. Rightfully so I say. The way they behaved in NO is deplorable. The savagery is almost impossible to comprehend.</p>
<p>The issue as I see it is that you are stuck with this problem. There is no way out of it. Where are these savages supposed to go?</p>
<p>The best possible thing that has happened from this is that white people have started to open their eyes and seen what blacks are actually capable of.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

					<p>I was in the army for 4 years and spent 1 of them in Iraq and got to spend a month Kosovo. I was more naive at the time, which wasnt long ago but I never thought I would see the 3rd world in all its savagery in my own country. </p>
<p>I deeply sympathize with the Gaurdsmen who came back from Iraq only to face more worthless savages in their own country, for some of them in their own state. I can only imagine how their families must feel after their sons and husbands survived Iraq only to possibly be killed by degenerates in thier own country. Thankfully it seems the bruthas werent tough enough to attack people who could actually defend themselvs. It is so disgusting that the media still portrays those savages as victims.</p>
<p>Anyway I would just like to thank Jared Taylor for his work. We need the white race to wake up before its to late for us. We truly are facing a crisis that we have only our selvs to blame for, but as <span class="caps">DS1 </span>says worse is better. The criminals who run our goverments and media are looking more absurd and the &#8220;black leadership&#8221; are only going to have a harder time making a case for their victimhood.  </p>

					<p>A simply great article. The final comments about how 50,000 whites in the Superdome would have behaved were spot on. </p>
<p>Like many Whites, my ancestors had to forge livelihoods on remote drought ridden land in Australia. The hardships they endured and continue to endure were every bit as difficult as the those caused by the hurricane Katrina. Yet they prevailed and, eventually, prospered. And they, like those around them, did this with Grace, Humility and Love for their neighbours.</p>

					<p>Two years ago, a hurricane struck the coastal city in Korea where I live. Some 87 deaths were attributed to Typhoon &#8220;Mae-Mi.&#8221; I was trapped in a shopping center, right in the thick of it. Not once did I feel I was in danger; not once was there any looting, or inclination to do so. The Koreans had a spirit of community, even in a difficult and dangerous storm. </p>
<p>That same scenario brought out the worst in blacks even before the levee broke (how symbolic). And to think that woman had the gall to say &#8220;I&rsquo;m ashamed of America.&#8221;  Well, we&rsquo;re ashamed of you, lady. </p>

					<p>Some worthy points that merit discussion: </p>
<p>&#8220;While I don&rsquo;t live in New Orleans and I didn&rsquo;t follow <br>
the mayor&rsquo;s race, <b>I&rsquo;m fairly certain that the black candidates sited their blackness as the reason why they should be in charge of the city.</b> They more than likely spoke <br><br>
of how only &ldquo;they&rdquo; knew what their problems were <br><br>
and only &ldquo;they&rdquo; knew how to solve them. Now &ldquo;they&rdquo; <br><br>
reap what &ldquo;they&rdquo; sow.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that elections of black mayors like <br>
Marion Barry and Nagin are a foregone conclusion in <br><br>
big urban centers  &mdash;  no matter what addictions, corruptions <br><br>
and incompetence they bring to the office.  They probably <br><br>
don&rsquo;t even have to campaign except for the cameras. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The only thing we can be sure of is that <b>had the victims been white, the <span class="caps">OUTCOME </span>would be different. </b>&#8220;</p>
<p>Ah, but some of the victims of Katrina <span class="caps">ARE </span>white. <br>
On <span class="caps">CNN</span>i, I have seen <b>one story</b> about Waveland, Mississippi, <br><br>
and the destruction there  &mdash;  but there is no looting and no violence. <br><br>
Whites are rebuilding their homes and helping each other. <br><br>
<i>The reporter was driving around the neighborhood doing <br><br>
his report from the street</i>  &mdash;  a situation unthinkable in <br><br>
<span class="caps">NOLA </span>at present. </p>
<p>If they continued doing standups from Mississippi, <br>
the contrast would have been unbearable. </p>

					<p>Guess we can put to rest the idea that White people are the only racists in America now? <br>
But that will be swept under the rug by the media and politicians.<br><br>

					<p>This is more great work from Jared Taylor! It fully captures the truth regarding black behavior and the hatred and contempt they have for whites! Unfortunately, white people will again choose <span class="caps">NOT </span>to see the racial truth, and will blame economics or the usual liberal nonsense rather than see reality. I understand why whites do this now. It&rsquo;s because they sense the tremendous changes and personal sacrifices they will have to make in order to assume racial thinking! It&rsquo;s so much easier to pretend everything is fine and dandy, rather than take responsibility for change. I blame Santa Clause and Christianity for this warped mentality!</p>

Kayne West   &mdash;   Any articles about him ?</p>
<p>His recent hit song has lyrics that are critical of a &#8220;White Girl.&#8221; Yet,  he said &#8220;Bush didn&rsquo;t care about Black People!&#8221;<br>
Will you ask the Press   &mdash;   any Press you meet, at any time, and show them print outs and actual evidence of both quotes side by side and <span class="caps">DEMAND </span>  &mdash;   next time you interview Kayne West to explain either of these two questions.</p>
<p>1) If its wrong to be ethnocentic   &mdash;   your mad that Bush was ethnocentric, prefering his group  &mdash;   then will you make an apology for your use of the critical lyrics about a &#8220;White Girl&#8221;</p>
<p>or <br>
2) If its proper to be ethnocentric and therefore your justified in your use of those lyrics about a &#8220;White Girl&#8221;, isn&rsquo;t Bush and the rest of Americans who happen to be White, entitled to the same <span class="caps">INCLINATION </span>- that you, Kayne West, have been shown to have ?</p>
<p>This belongs in Hurricane story   &mdash;   since this was the method of getting the <span class="caps">ACTUAL VIDEO</span> OF <span class="caps">LOOTINGS  </span>  &mdash;   which couldn&rsquo;t be spun   &mdash;   off the air  <span class="caps">AND REPLACE</span> IT <span class="caps">WITH</span> A <span class="caps">REVISIONIST HISTORY </span>- that months later will only be remembered as more evidence that somehow Whites   &mdash;   or at least Bush was racist   &mdash;   even though <span class="caps">HE&rsquo;S </span>giving Billions to help mainly blacks </p>
<p>otherwise strong article - send to every single talk radio host in America and the world   &mdash;   regardless of if they agree or not   &mdash;   perhaps invite fellow authors or posters to be on the air   &mdash;  - can&rsquo;t just be one person Jared Taylor on all the stations at once - how would it be if 1 person per show was to appear <span class="caps">THAT WOULD ACTUALLY </span>build a <span class="caps">POSITIVE MOVEMENT </span>- rather than just reaching the converted </p>

					<p>You should be ashamed of this disgusting filth you are attempting to propogate as truth. Luckily only racists read this ridiculous and revolting websight so I&rsquo;m not really too concerned with how your vile opinions will effect the world. </p>
<p>Posted by Apalled and Horrifed at 8:30 PM on September 5 </p>
<p>Perhaps Apalled and Horrified would care to point out the areas of this article which are attemting to &#8220;propogate truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having witnessed black crime, both to property and to race in New Orleans it seems rather far fetched to turn around and accuse the white rescuers of racism whilst simoultaneously smearing the inescapable truth of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s article as untrue.</p>
<p>Most intelligent, un-brainwashed people are disgusted by the actions of some of the city&rsquo;s blacks and are equally disgusted if not bemused by statements such as Mr/Mrs/Ms Apalled and Horrified.</p>
<p>We have reached our own conclusions about blacks, reinforced by the warped thinking of those such as <span class="caps">A&H.</span></p>
<p>In order to salvage any reputation that you may have left, please list and refute any points Mr Taylor has lied about. if you cannot, your post has simply reinforced our belief that too many blacks (or white liberals) have a slender grasp of both reality and sanity.</p>
<p>I await with bated breath. </p>

					<p>After seeing the Hurricane&rsquo;s aftermaths on this site for the past 3 days or more dealing with mostly black looters I&rsquo;m sure there is something else to talk about? I&rsquo;ve been coming to this site for months and there&rsquo;s never a time when there&rsquo;s not like at least 5 or 6 articles for the day. What gives? Only having to read one article a day is throwing my schedule off. Oh, yeah. Something about the article. You know it says Africa in our midst but when I think of Africans looters doesn&rsquo;t come to mind. Maybe backwards and a little paganistic. I&rsquo;m thinking maybe Americans and some European, mostly England, with African heritage when it comes to looting. And have we done statistics on how much &#8216;black&rsquo; causes this impulsive or genetic behavioral response? I mean, I see posts on how blacks are but it doesn&rsquo;t really specify how much you have to be to become more acceptable. 45 percent? 70 percent? Does actually &#8216;thinking&rsquo; your black cause it as well? But then, are you just doing it because you think it&rsquo;s something &#8216;blacks&rsquo; would do and you wake up hating yourself in the morning? I wish this stuff was more cut and dry, black and white. Too many shades of grey. And its always great when a natural disaster is used as a &#8216;wake up call&rsquo; from God. Why can&rsquo;t these things just be natural disasters and nothing else? From my delving into the bible, it is apparent that if God is going to wake up anybody it will be this entire plane of existence and we&rsquo;ll all wake up in purgatory awaiting our final destination. All of us. Maybe he&rsquo;ll leave one or two. Both of an asiatic race.</p>

					<p>&lsquo;&hellip;..footage from Belfast, in Northern Ireland where gangs of white Loyalist youths attacked police officers, hijacked cars and burned them, attacked innocent passers by and destroyed their own neighbourhoods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Northern Ireland&rsquo;s sectarian violence is nothing to be proud out but Belfast has not seen a near total breakdown of civil society on anything like the same scale as <span class="caps">NO.</span> I think you&rsquo;ll find that the neighbourhoods are scarred but very much intact.</p>
<p>No doubt about it, Northern Ireland has seen extreme &lsquo;white&rsquo; violence. However, the people have never tried to make a virtue out of the situation; they have always aspired to something better. Belfast is not a dysfunctional city and its woes are balanced by a long record of high achievement.</p>

					<p>Blacks Loot New Orleans!! </p>
<p>The obvious question should be: &#8220;Is anyone really surprised?&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at the infamous New York City power outage  &mdash;  a six to eight hour event occurring in 1977. Merely the fact that the city was without electricity for several hours was ample excuse for Blacks to smash into shops and stores, looting, stealing whatever they could haul off. </p>
<p>During any civil disobedience or riot, Blacks looted and looted and looted. If there truly is a failing in New Orleans it is theat of the State and Local Officials in <span class="caps">NOT ANTICIPATING THIS </span>and not placing armed guards throughout the area. That Blacks will loot and steal during such an event is as predictable as the time of tomorrow&rsquo;s sunrise. Yet our media, the political pundits and Black leaders will fall over themselves &#8220;explaining&#8221; away Black crime. While completely ignoring the obvious  &mdash;  the inability of the majority of Blackds to live and act like human beings instead of what they are. But, as we are constantly told, racial diversity is good for everyone. Yeah, right!</p>

					<p>What is so sickening is to watch the big networks and their bleeding hearts interview NO mayor Nagin and kiss his butt when this punk is the biggest criminal white hater in the city. Nagin probably had his looters get him a couple tvs and other loot.</p>
<p>This is 2 edged sword as latino lover Bush deserves everything he gets with his rich kid playtoy bogus war in Iraq wasting 500 billion but also the world saw the gutter race of the planet who have milked the white race for 140 yrs and refuse to return to Africa. </p>

					<p>Thank you, Mr. Taylor for an excellent and truthful article about an event that the media is struggling in vain to present in the &#8220;correct&#8221; light.  I echo Phil Peterson when I say: spread the word.</p>

					<p>To the poster who pointed out the riots by whites in Northern Ireland:</p>
<p>No-one has ever said whites were perfect and never behaved badly. All races, without exception, contain criminals and psychopaths, as well as decent people with too little intelligence to cope effectively with life&rsquo;s problems. The problem with the black race is that it contains a far higher percentage of criminals and psychopaths than any other, as well as a far higher percentage of those with very low intelligence. The longer those clear facts are denied and lied away, the worse the eventual consequences for all of us are going to be.</p>

<p>Are they all from the descended slaves, having lived here for generations and <span class="caps">STILL </span>not get any iota of decency or civilization into their heads?</p>

					<p>[&#8220;I was watching the Television tonight and on the news was footage from Belfast, in Northern Ireland where gangs of white Loyalist youths attacked police officers,hijacked cars and burned them,attacked innocent passers by and destroyed their own neighbourhoods.<br>
Will Mr.Taylor conclude that these youths are less than human and inferior or will they get a free pass because they are white?&#8221;<br><br>

<p>Carver exhibits the usual wilful obtuseness of those committed to the liberal utopia.  No one is suggesting that whites cannot behave as savages or that individual blacks cannot behave in a civilised manner.  The point is that on average through history white societies have attained and maintained higher standards of civilisation than black societies (notwithstanding Hitler and Lenin and Stalin).  In order to gain an accurate idea, we must compare like with like.  To use thuggish behaviour under the conditions in Northern Ireland (subverted by terrorist organisations like the <span class="caps">IRA </span>& loyalist terrorism in reaction) as the standard of white behaviour is just plain ludicrous.  A fairer example would be the white control in the wake of the New York 9/11 attack.  Compare that to the black lack in New Orleans.  (No - wealth and lack of wealth has nothing to do with it.)  In white dominated areas ordinary people behave well, in black dominated areas ordinary people soon behave like savages.  We have seen this again and again here in Africa.  Withdraw the whites and civilisation withdraws too.  Apartheid was denigrated as evil and thuggish by those who wish to believe in the &ldquo;noble&rdquo; savage and the inveterate evil of whites – those who live far away from these &ldquo;noble&rdquo; savages.  To those of us who live in the real world, Apartheid was an attempt to preserve civilisation and decency in the face of a savage world.  If only the bleeding heart purblind liberals could be forced walk the walk they like to talk, but unfortunately it is usually decent whites (and decent blacks) who have to pay the price so that these twisted backstabbers and traitors can feel morally superior.<br>

					<p>&#8220;What would be interesting to learn, what is the origin of these Blacks. Are they the descendants of the slaves, or are they imported from Haiti, or Somalia or some other place?&#8221;</p>
<p>A little education, these were quote unquote African Americans. Take it from a black man. I am much, more comfortable around black immigrants than I am around African Americans. Eevn immigrants from west Africa behave with more civility than my group. Take the time to notice the differecne in the behavior of my group and black immigrants. If you really notice intensely you will see that the behavior of black immigrants is more settling. A friend of mine from Nigeria told me that they laugh at us when we celebrate Kwanza, a holiday that was invented by some black man in California in the sixties, as some original African holiday. My Nigerian friend is often perplexed by our unwillingness to take advantage of the many opportunities this nation offers. One last item-most black folk say the same things about blacks that the posters on this website do. Whites are not the only ones who do not hold a favorable opinion of blacks. By and large, we don&rsquo;t hold a favorable opinion of ourselves. Black folk hate other black folk more than any other group on the palnet. My final thought, back in the sixties when my mother said, &#8220;Integration will not work because we black people just will not do right.&#8221;     </p>

					<p>This was predictable.  It could have been on a larger scale if it had happened in Cleveland, Detroit, Newark, or any other place with a large black demographic.</p>
<p>We are dealing, in general, certainly within the first standard deviation, with a demographic that is well below the mean IQ of whites or asians.  An examination of the crime rate for blacks, especially violent crime, sexual misconduct, and general moral degradation, and the events in New Orleans should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>Diversity does not strengthen, it only divides and America has been degraded for decades by immigration of the genetic toxic waste of the third world.  We have our own toxic waste here in the form of an urban black population that is a threat to all things civilized in this once great nation.</p>

					<p>Someone asked about the savagery in Belfast.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know the answer, but I suspect that it is <br><br>
unique and isolated.  Probably due to the specific<br><br>
and local political/historical situation.<br><br>
Are there any other locales of widespread white savagery?<br><br>
  On the other side, meanwhile there is:<br><br>
Los Angeles, Detroit, Miami, New York, New Orleans, etc etc.<br><br>
The point is, wherever there is a crisis in a city with<br><br>
a certain type of population demographic, there is mass violence.  This is repeated over and over, and all over.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor does not need to do these things because society, government and the media does not excuse white anti-social behavior and criminality against other ethic/racial groups. </p>
<p>If a protestant attacks a catholic for simply being catholic he is treated as a bigoted savage - as he deserves to be. However if a Black man attacks a white man simply because he is white he is portrayed also as a victim driven by desperation by an institutionally racist white society.</p>

					<p>I agree with the whole article and even when you have all the intellectual information on IQ and personality traits it is still shocking to see how it plays out in real life.</p>
<p>let me note one wonderful exception though: a news crew on a boat came past a house with one black man still in there. they asked him why he hadn&rsquo;t evacuated, and he said that a couple of days ago the authorities came by his house for the evacuation and he and his wife wanted to take their dog (a medium sized cool doggy) with them, which they were not allowed to do. So while the wife was evacuated the man decided to stay behind with his dog. </p>
<p>I thought that was a very nice and human thing to do&hellip;</p>

					<p>Taylor&rsquo;s homiletic account should be required reading at every high school around the country.  Considering the incantatory wails of &#8220;racist&#8221; that he will receive from his fellow intellectuals, I hope Taylor, in the manner of those brave Aussies, is able to circle the chairs.  I am inspired by him to try my own hand at delineation of the obvious.  Smoke not.  Wear your seat belt.  Shun blacks.  Yes, it&rsquo;s really that simple.</p>

					<p>what would also be ver very interesting is to compare the average donations for the rescue effort that respectively whites and blacks give. i would be very much surprised if the average black donation is higher than a quarter of the average white donation, even when you correct it for socio-economic position&hellip;</p>

					<p>Straight talk from Mr. Taylor, putting into words what more and more of us are feeling, deep down  &mdash;  a silent and startling conviction that we are indeed perceived by savages as sheep to be literally slaughtered for their amusement to assauge their envy and resentment.</p>
<p>The left, and the media, seem to be dumping on Bush in order to distract us from the failings of the Mayor and probably the Governor, and most of all to distract us from the ease, even the glee, with which these Blacks (not all of them, to be sure) embraced a state of total conscience-less-ness.</p>

					<p>In only one source (Michael Medved quoting the <span class="caps">NYT</span>imes) did I hear that the reason many blacks stayed in NO was that it was the end of the month, and the welfare checks come on the first of the month. Philly is opening its arms to these &#8220;families.&#8221; I find the use of the word families confusing in this respect until I remember that a black family may be a 14-year-old girl with a baby. But the media would have us believe that all of the evacuees dispersing around the country are some kind of Okies maybe, just peace-lovin&rsquo; families with dad looking for a good job.</p>

					<p>Yes, Carver, some of the Irish do oppose authority. The Gaza settlers opposed it when they had to vacate. We Americans have opposed it throughout our history.</p>
<p>In this case, however, the authorities were not <span class="caps">SUPPRESSING </span>anyone (except looters and murderers)!  They were there TO <span class="caps">HELP</span>!<br>
Who in their right mind would shoot at someone trying to save their life?  Who in their right mind would try to kill someone trying to save them?</p>

					<p>Carver: Northern Ireland has been in a state of civil war for many years, and the images you saw are from a war zone.  Apparently you need to be reminded that New Orleans and its vicinity just suffered a natural disaster, not a civil war, and some blacks took that as a reason to behave like animals.

					<p>Dear Jared,</p>
<p>I wish your article was published all major papers nationwide.  The brutality and viciousness is something that America needs to know about.  We are so deceived by the media, by Hollywood, by our own government all because&hellip;why?  They are afraid of being called names?  being sued?  Murdering and raping children?  It is despicable!  It is diabolical.  It is Africa&hellip;</p>
<p>It is a shame I cannot talk about all of this in detail with family and friends.  They are so blinded by political correctness and the idea that this knowledge is somehow hateful that I cannot truly reveal my disgust or share a wonderful article such as yours without ostracizing myself.  <br>
Why must we be ashamed for speaking the truth?  It is so frustrating!  While I do have black people I am friendly with and that I care about, I am not fooled into thinking that they are like me.  They are not only from a completely foreign culture but genetically we are very different.  Even though the blacks I know are upper middle class, I see where they lack foresight and cannot make consistently healthy choices.  It is sad but I am thankful for the difference.  I love my people though that is taboo in our society.  I cherish my culture and heritage and grieve the loss of them both. Almost every white person I know has no identity and has no idea that their culture is even dying.  We must embrace the heritage and cultural practices of every minority but not our own, according not only to the media but also now our faith.  As a Christian I am supposed to love my neighbor as myself.  I am supposed to turn the other cheek.  I am supposed to be colorblind.  How can I grow in my faith and embrace a Christian lifestyle if I have to ignore facts?  It is so difficult for me to find a balance.  It is not hate but facts that drive me.  I see the destruction wrought by blacks and other non-Europeans on our country and I cannot deny the differences between us.  How can I safely raise my children in this society?  I feel trapped and alone.  Just this weekend I found myself in a very uncomfortable position. My 6 year old daughter saw a black man and a white woman together at the store when she was with my mother and said &#8220;Yuck&#8221;.  My mother asked her why she she &#8220;Yuck&#8221; and my 6 year old said &#8220;they shouldn&rsquo;t be together&#8221;.  My mother was shocked.  She asked my child why they shouldn&rsquo;t be together and she said &#8220;because they are different&#8221;.  My mom told her that only their skin was different and that God made us all the same.  My child then said &#8220;their children won&rsquo;t know who they are&#8221;.  What I found to be a very astute observation, my mother saw as racism.  Well, what do you say to your mother about her grandchild&rsquo;s views?  &#8220;We are raising little <span class="caps">KKK</span>ers, please don&rsquo;t interfere?&#8221;  It&rsquo;s awful!  I cannot disagree with my child&rsquo;s observations and yet I worry about how the world will view her when her own grandparents see our beliefs as somehow anti-Christian.</p>
<p>Only seeing the written words of those like minded individuals gives me peace. Thank you, Jared for doing your part in spreading the truth.  For those of us who cannot speak it is essential.  </p>
<p>Sincerly, </p>
<p>Rosalyn from Texas</p>

					<p>Think of the story of the Australians huddled together for security in the Superdome against a mob of hostile blacks; now imagine, just for the sake of argument, that this was a small group of blacks in a similar situation menaced by racist whites. We would be hearing of nothing else from the media! It would be made into a big-budget movie starring Denzel Washington and LL Cool J, and be worked into the curriculum for Black History month. </p>
<p>As it is, it will be swept under the rug. If it is mentioned at all, it will be with some resentment that a group of whites was helped out of the Superdome early by a National Guardsman.</p>

					<p>Sadly, and unbelievably, I don&rsquo;t think this is going to help wake up non-aware whites in the least.  With the liberals harping on the totally untrue reasons why these people are looting, murdering, raping etc. because they have been impoverished for so long, the brainwashed white citizens of this country will obediently lap this stupidity up.  When a broadcast of a popular morning show was purposely interrupted while a white person was talking about the threats and attacks on whites by blacks, when it returned they were discussing viewers&rsquo; choices of wedding cakes!  Can you believe the media blackout on the <span class="caps">TRUTH </span>of what is going on?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m afraid we are looking at our future unless by some miracle whites regain their bravery and put these animals in their place.  Here is a great opportunity to re-locate these creatures in semi-human form back to Africa.  Instead of using $$$ to rebuild the neighborhoods just so they can continue their usual preying on white tourists, take the billions and use it to get them settled into Africa.  After the War for Southern Independence, the US government had begun just such a repatriation but unfortunately for white people a century later, they did not finish the job.  Now we are left with the horror our country has become.  Let&rsquo;s finish what they started.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a horrible thought, but my first knee-jerk reaction on learning what was really going on in the Superdome was to drop a bomb on the place and at least remove part of the problem.  Horrid, I know, but the <span class="caps">REAL </span>news coming out of the Gulf states has angered me more then any &#8220;racial&#8221; event in recent history.<br>

					<p>I can explain the reasons for the belated response by <span class="caps">FEMA </span>and the <span class="caps">FEDS </span>to the crisis in New Orleans. 1) One must remember that the Federal Government is not obligated in any form to protect it&rsquo;s citizens as a whole or individually. Remember, their designed purpose is to confiscate the wealth and production of its subjects and not to provide for their proctection. Only in very rare cases has an American citizen sued and won a case because of the local authorities failure to protect them. Consider the mid-Western farmers who are arrested for protecting their families and property from our &#8220;peaceful&#8221; illegal neighbors from the south of <span class="caps">TX. </span> Rest assured, however, that the upstanding citizens of NO will demand monetary reperations from the <span class="caps">FED </span>and the state of La. and a lifetime taxpayer annutity to boot.</p>
<p>2) The NO disaster has undeniably proved that <span class="caps">FEMA </span>was not created to respond to a natural disaster as the agencys name ambiguously implies. <span class="caps">FEMA </span>was created to respond to a &#8220;national emergency&#8221;, eg., acts or threats of terrorism, political unrest, etc., and can be enacted by the stroke of the Presients pen. This would mean peacetime martial law whereby <span class="caps">FEMA </span>would possess plenary powers to divide, relocate, and harbor (by force) the American population-Soviet style. It is important to make the proper distinction between &#8220;natural disaster&#8221; and &#8220;national emergency&#8221;. Recent events should suffice that <span class="caps">FEMA </span>was not designed for the former. </p>

					<p>Dear Appalled and Horrified:</p>
<p>I see your e-mail is &#8220;BestJewishNanny&#8221;.  Presumably you are Jewish. </p>
<p>So tell me, in all your studies of the Holocaust, in all your investigations and reading of what happened to the Jewish people during its worst oppression, have you ever read of Jewish boys dragging five and seven-year-old Jewish boys and girls off to gang rape them and slit their throats?  </p>
<p>Have you ever heard of any group of Jewish people, no matter how degraded or oppressed, who would sit en masse and listen all night to screams of Jewish girls being attacked and Jewish people being killed by a handful of Jewish hoodlums?  </p>
<p>Have you ever heard of any case of Jewish looting on the order of what you have seen in New Orleans?</p>
<p>I thought not. </p>
<p>You have a horrible double standard, Miss BestJewishNanny. By making excuses for them, you hold blacks to no standard of behavior whatsoever, not even a pathetic standard that is so low it would be utterly intolerable and revolting to even the poorest, most depressed, most deprived, most oppressed Jewish community ON <span class="caps">THE FACE</span> OF <span class="caps">THE EARTH, </span>a standard so low that it would be a badge of shame and guilt for every Jew everywhere.</p>
<p>And you call us racist? At least many of us have hope that somewhere, somehow something can be done for black folks to relieve their degradation.  But we are also smart enough to realize that they have to be held to a standard before that can ever happen.  They have to have people who show them where they are lacking and explain to then that their behavior is inexcusable. </p>
<p>You would sooner look the other way, treat them as animals who cannot be expected to exist as fully human, like some kind of savage dog that has been mistreated: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t get angry with him, he can&rsquo;t help it!&#8221; </p>
<p>I cannot do that any longer.  I cannot look away with that shrug of the shoulders.  I cannot throw a few more welfare bucks into their neighborhoods like some kind of kibble for my conscience and expect anthing to get better.  You see, Miss BestJewishNanny, permitting any people to engage in that kind of activity without holding them accountable does them and the rest of humanity no favors.</p>

					<p>People on this site are saying how the New Orleans fiasco should wake White people up&hellip;..yeah, it should wake them up to the fact that even after 911, the federal government is still <span class="caps">NOT </span>ready to deal with the consequences of a major terrorist nuclear or biological attack!!!!  Their response time in New Orleans was abysmal and the people in charge of <span class="caps">FEMA </span>are empty suits who obviously got their jobs through political patronage! That should be the <span class="caps">MAJOR </span>concern!!! Rudy Guliani, we need ya&rsquo;, man!!!</p>
<p>Some commentators on this site emphasize how Blacks are &#8220;animalistic&#8221;&hellip;.how easy it is to judge others who have gone without food, water, toiletries, and sanitation for five days while you type on your computer from the air-conditioned comfort of your home.  You&rsquo;re not at ground zero in a putrid flooded mess, but all of sudden you&rsquo;re an expert on the actions of the police and the stranded residents.  So <span class="caps">ALL</span> Blacks are responsible now for the actions those in New Orleans?  Look, those poor White tourists, through no fault of their own, were in the wrong place at the wrong time and unfortunately got stuck with some of the residents of New Orleans worst neighborhoods in the worst of circumstances (people on this site act like the Black doctors, nurses, teachers, college adminstrators, lawyers, and <span class="caps">MBA&rsquo;</span>s who live in the all-Black neighborhoods on the other side of New Orleans would have terrorized these poor kids also!).  It&rsquo;s a <span class="caps">CLASS </span>thing, people, not just <span class="caps">RACE</span>!!!!  Let me drop any one of you well-fed and smug bigots into the middle of the drug-plaqued White ghettos of South Boston and let me see how safe <span class="caps">YOU </span>feel&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>A post on another site said it best, &#8220;Black people are the only people in the world who are judged by the worst they have to offer and not the best.&#8221; Are <span class="caps">ALL</span> Whites to be judged by the <span class="caps">BTK</span> Killer and this steady stream of horrific child molestors that seem to be in the news every week???</p>

					<p>   I am copying this and numerous other articles I&rsquo;ve seen on this website and others about what happened at the Superdome and in New Orleans, in general.  </p>
<p>   And then, I&rsquo;m taking a big stack of copied material over to my local county newspaper to give to the Editor.  He has called my letters inflammatory, in phone conversations with me.  Let&rsquo;s see what he has to say, if anything, about my opinions now.  </p>
<p>    I&rsquo;ve already seen some very upsetting things on my local, Atlanta, news tv stations.  Will whites ever learn from history?  I think not.  They showed a couple, black man, white woman, and their child, who had come to the Atlanta area since the Hurricane.  They have nothing and were complaining about their situation.  Well, wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, a local white church came to their aid.  They&rsquo;ve been given a house, rent free for six months, along with every other modern luxury they could possibly want.  </p>
<p>     And I had to ask myself:  why couldn&rsquo;t this white church help a <span class="caps">WHITE </span>couple instead of a multicult couple??  This couple was so physically ugly and so obviously low rent  &mdash;  these two were obviously the dregs of society who had decided to join forces and procreate.   Sickening!</p>
<p>    Then, last night on Channel ll, I saw a nice upper middle class white family who had <span class="caps">OPENED </span>up their own home to a <span class="caps">BLACK </span>family to actually move in with them and live.  The white man was shown saying &#8220;I just wanted to help someone &#8220;JUST <span class="caps">LIKE MYSELF</span>&#8221;????????   I&rsquo;m sorry, but what????????  Someone just like you  &mdash;  why does that not indicate a white family?  </p>
<p>   The people who have opened up their hearts to help these blacks and multicult whites are so eaten up with white guilt and  so brainwashed by the multicult propoganda machine in this country that it truly is pathetic.</p>
<p>    As I&rsquo;ve stated before, I&rsquo;m not giving one red cent to the Hurricane efforts, lest my money be given to some ungrateful, white hating black.  The whites who need help will either get it from someone else or will just pick themselves up by their bootstraps and begin again.  I will give to efforts to save what few remaining dogs and cats still alive can be saved.</p>
<p>   And the media in this country should all be marched out into a field and shot point blank for the biased, mean spirited, lies they have told throughout this sad sorry ordeal.  </p>
<p>   What disgrace this bunch of losers has brought on this country to be shown to the world.     <br>
    </p>

					<p>When i saw that this artricle was by Jared Taylor I knew it was going to be a fact-filled, hard-hitting piece and I was not disappointed. Each paragraph was more shocking and horrifying than the preceding one. </p>
<p>Is it just me, or could this disaster be a historic turning point in how whites think about black people? All this time we were told that black riots are a form of &ldquo;political protest&rdquo; in response to injustice. This was a natural disaster and yet it had all the earmarks of a &ldquo;riot!&rdquo; Raping, looting, stepping over bodies, shooting at rescue vehicles, and all the time, of course, blaming whitey for their problems. Is it that much of a leap to conclude that this is just the natural behavior of the majority of blacks? Plus when you contrast the behavior of these blacks with that of whites and Asians (especially the recent tsunami disaster which is so fresh in everybody&rsquo;s mind), it&rsquo;s hard not to conclude that these people are almost like a different species.</p>
<p>Of course, the media will try very hard to paint this as some kind of failure of the federal government. I already wrote a polite, measured letter to my local paper in response to an article that brought up &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; This can be effective but it must be very carefully worded or it will only cause people to put their guard up.</p>
<p>And to &#8220;Apalled and Horrifed:&#8221; exactly what parts of the article were not true?</p>

					<p>Craig&rsquo;s comment that &#8220;You make me ashamed to be white,&#8221; is a clear demonstration of the job the PC Kommisars have done in brainwashing many whites to ignore the truth.  Even when it is thrust in their faces via situations like the one in New Orleans.  The flip side is that this disaster has indeed shaken the cobwebs loose from a good portion of those sleepwalkers, and the ball is rolling in earnest.  As the overall situation in the US deteriorates due to incidents like this and the continued flooding of our country with low IQ third worlders from Mexico and other hell holes from around the world, more and more whites will be forced to face reality.  Those who refuse, like Craig, can walk open armed into the crowds of non-whites and see how they are received.  It&rsquo;s a shame things have to come this far, and indeed will have to go further, to get whites to think clearly, to start questioning the status quo. </p>

<p>The real answer Craig, is for raciallly conscious whites (and racially conscious non-whites) to each have their own living space(s).  This will solve our racial, cultural and social problems forever.  </p>
<p>We will live in an advanced society, happily ever after and you and other naive whites will come to a genetic end, which I beleive you should be free to do.     </p>

					<p>This whole fiasco is scaring the hell out of us Maltese. We could clearly see the media bias on TV as Sky news (UK) was showing looting and all sorts whilst <span class="caps">CNN </span>was all out condeming the government for &#8216;racism&rsquo; and portraying looters as victims.</p>
<p>Over here we are in the midst of a demographic invasion of &#8216;refugees&rsquo; from Africa. Malta is a very peaceful country but we are already witnessing black violence in our night district. We fear the worst.</p>

					<p>My first thought when I heard about the flooding of New Orleans was that I should budget a donation for them.  Since this has turned into the typical Euro-bashing, those people can go to hell.  You know they wouldn&rsquo;t help European Americans if the situation were reversed.</p>
<p>About 1,000 &#8220;hurricane refugees&#8221; are arriving to churches in the San Francisco area, even though we already have a large homeless population here and housing costs much higher than the housing costs of Louisiana.  On the news last night there was an Oakland-area family admitting that they were planning to put their relatives on the public dole, and the relatives hadn&rsquo;t even been here 24 hours before the assumption that their own flesh and blood should be the government responsibility was made by this family that was not homeless themselves. Call me the R word if you must, but I bet you can guess what race they are.</p>

					<p>Jared Taylor, as I have come to expect from him, has put together the best summary of the NO mess I have seen thus far.  Jared never fails to be calm, balanced, and literate even while reporting on such a horrifying, unmitigated, 3rd-World calamity as this.</p>
<p>There are plenty of stories still to be told about this disaster.  There is no doubt this info will be available on the Internet to those motivated to look.  Let&rsquo;s just hope it finds its way out to a larger audience.</p>
<p>Early in the disaster, the 24-hr news channels were so eager for something to show that they put on whatever raw footage was available.  Later on they became much more &#8220;careful&#8221; about what they were showing.</p>
<p>If this debacle wakes up some more Americans, then it was not a total loss.</p>
<p>And Craig, let me get this straight  &mdash;  you are ashamed to be <span class="caps">WHITE</span>???  Does this story make you wish you were Black?</p>

					<p>Opinions of a white moderate (but with some extreme sociobiological views on certain subjects):<br>
1) The federal response was poorly organized - I don&rsquo;t think this had anything to do with the race of the victims, just ineptitude at many levels<br><br>
2) Some of the blacks who could not leave genuinely could not do so for economic reasons.  Yes some of the probably stayed to loot.<br><br>
3) I do think this confirms to me a tendency toward abject criminality in some blacks.  I believe some of this is social and cultural, some it is genetic.  If the family structure of poor blacks were not so broken down and their gang-banger music culture not so poisoned, I think the situation in New Orleans would have been as bad.  Blacks I work with or know from countries other than the US are much easier to get along with than American Blacks.  Remember there are undoubtably middle and upper-middle class blacks in <span class="caps">NOLA </span>who would have left along with the like class whites.  The question is how to formulate a politically palatable solution to the problem. Shipping them all back to Africa is not going to happen.  Maybe young black males who commit crimes should be sterilized.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Sadly, and unbelievably, I don&rsquo;t think this is going to help wake up non-aware whites in the least. With the liberals harping on the totally untrue reasons why these people are looting, murdering, raping etc. because they have been impoverished for so long, the brainwashed white citizens of this country will obediently lap this stupidity up. When a broadcast of a popular morning show was purposely interrupted while a white person was talking about the threats and attacks on whites by blacks, when it returned they were discussing viewers&rsquo; choices of wedding cakes! Can you believe the media blackout on the <span class="caps">TRUTH </span>of what is going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>This pessimism has got to stop.  As far as the media goes, there are only certain groups of people who are falling for this PC garbage they are spreading(rich liberal white people and blacks; in other words, it is the groups of people who benefit from this propaganda).  Do you honestly think that the overwhelming majority of whites in this nation are agreeing with these hateful statements about blacks suffering from the hurricane because of white racism?  </p>
<p>If you have not already noticed, numerous white figures in the media such as Bill <span class="caps">O&rsquo;R</span>eilly, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and  Neal Boortz are hammering this issue like there is no tomorrow, and they are not letting off of it either.  I was just listening to Neal Boortz the other day, and he was saying straight out on his radio program that the blacks in New Orleans are poor because of their own mistakes and it is no one else&rsquo;s fault.  He also kept mentioning the fact that the only reason Bush is getting blamed instead of the mayor of New Orleans, is simply because the former is white and the latter is black.  Many white callers called in agreeing with him.  Bill <span class="caps">O&rsquo;R</span>eilly has argued with a couple of prominent leaders of the black community (on his show) about how absurd it is to be bringing the issue of racism into this disaster.</p>
<p>To say that this situation is <span class="caps">NOT </span>opening any eyes up around the country is plain foolish and short-sighted, and it just shows what little confidence you have in the white race&rsquo;s sanity.  Don&rsquo;t be so pessimistic.</p>

<p>Matters such as this are supposed to be taken care of first at the municipal and state level.  The disorganization during the aftermath of the hurricane was mostly the fault of the incompetent <span class="caps">BLACK </span>mayor of New Orleans, who was probably hired through affirmative action, and the incompetent <span class="caps">FEMALE </span>governer of the state. </p>

					<p>Some posters seemed shocked that more white folks are not awake to these facts.  Well some white folks have always been asleep and always will be.  Nothing new.  It has always been that way.  They are too comfortable.  </p>
<p>Revolutions do not start with the many.  Revolutions start with the few.  Always have   &mdash;  -always will.  We need 10 percent of the population to be awake.  We need only 2 percent willing to act in some way.  Action means posting on websites, talking with neighbors etc..etc.  Action consists of <span class="caps">ANY</span> Revolution act.  No matter how minor.  Just act.  People will get bolder and bolder.  Strange alliances will develop.etc.etc.  Study Revolutionary enviroments.  Political Correctness IS a religion and we are the heretics.</p>
<p>One warning, I hear much anger toward blacks.  While it is warranted.  <span class="caps">THEY</span> DO <span class="caps">NOT HAVE ANY POWER. </span> I expected blacks to do that. I expect <span class="caps">HYENAS </span>to attack. WE <span class="caps">MUST BLAME WHOEVER LET THE HYENAS OUT</span> TO <span class="caps">ROAM AROUND.  </span></p>
<p>And my black friends (yes, <span class="caps">DS1 </span>has black friends) knew as soon as the storm hit that it was gonna be ugly.  The good black folk I know are just as outraged at these animals. They are even more outraged that they are never permitted by their miscreant leaders to deal with them.  So don&rsquo;t get angry at blacks. <span class="caps">THEY DON&rsquo;T HAVE ANY POWER. </span></p>
<p>Evil black elements are like big dangerous mosquitoes  &mdash;  -there job is to do suck blood.  They are only dangerous if you are not aware of the danger.  There will always be some random event taking lives that cannot be avoided. In this country, blacks are treated like Angels.  They are not treated like human beings.  Anyone that treats you like an Angel will eventually treat you like a devil.</p>
<p>Our job is to focus on the &#8220;THE <span class="caps">POLITICAL CLASS</span>&#8221; and they are all white for the most part.  Make sure our people and anyone else that cares   &mdash;  -&#8220;KNOWS <span class="caps">THE ENEMY</span>&#8221;.  Your enemy is generally white males in power.  Yeah, there is a handful of them that are jewish.  But the vast majority are <span class="caps">NOT. </span> Know you enemy. </p>
<p>By the way, the enemy is <span class="caps">NOT </span>concerned with ethnic conflict.  They have planned for that <span class="caps">LONG AGO. </span> Their sole concern is protecting their <span class="caps">PROPERTY. </span> Their big concern is <span class="caps">UNORGANIZED POWER.</span> They know that they are in the  beginnings of a revolutionary enviroment.  Revolutions happen because it is <span class="caps">TIME </span>for them to happen.  No other reason.  They want to mantain power and their property at all costs.   And from the looks of this Govt. and the infamous Fema after this natural disaster.  Any half wit can conclude that they have very little organised power left! They are disintegrating. Worthless.  More importantly the confidence in Washington as  a solution provider has suffered in the eyes of everyone.  That is good. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that anyone could have written a better script to undermine confidence in Washington.  <span class="caps">GLOBALLY </span>and <span class="caps">LOCALLY. </span> That is a good thing. I believe it was Napoleon that stated something along the lines of &#8220;one should never bother  interfering with one&rsquo;s enemy while he is busy making mistakes&#8221;. </p>
<p>One thing that bothers me.  I have noticed this time and time again.  Some (maybe too many??) people in this movement and folks discussing these topics take life way to seriously.  And for good reason.  But you need to have a fun positive outlook and learn to laugh more.  This is just my opinion. Based on what I have seen so far.   </p>
<p>Yeah, I know you want to panic.  Yeah, I know the white folks are severely threatened.  However, if you read enough European History.  You will see that there were plenty of times that all was lost.  Plenty of times were the leaders and traitors sold out the people and we are all still here.  The world will be here.  The world will go on.  Stay on message and try to have fun.  Be optimistic.  At least you know the truth.  As a young man, I felt a great deal of relief when I found out that I was not the only sane person on earth.  That was a good day.  </p>

					<p>Don&rsquo;t worry Raj Patel,</p>
<p>We recognize Indians as being far more advanced than blacks.  We don&rsquo;t judge you in the same likeness as them just because you have the same skin color as they do.</p>
<p>How does the Indian community, here in America as well as over in India view black people?  For some reason I have gotten the impression that the Indian community, at least in the area I live, doesn&rsquo;t have as low an opinion of blacks as the East Asians (Koreans etc..) do.   </p>

					<p>I hear some yapping about Northern Ireland.  NI has been at war in one for or another for nearly 8 centuries.  The Sectarian violence goes both ways.  There are elements on both sides that need to be shot.  To understand <span class="caps">NI, </span>you first have to become confused.  Nothing ever IS as IT <span class="caps">APPEARS </span>to be when it comes to Northern Ireland.  There are alot of things that most people just don&rsquo;t know (even people that are informed).</p>
<p>One thing I will tell you.  The people in Northern Ireland police their own.  Yes, there is a history of outer group violence.  But in General Protestants punish their own and so do the Catholics.  They shoot drug dealers and rapists.  The protestants have knee capped theives with black and decker drills.  </p>
<p>Since they show a <span class="caps">RUTHLESS </span>vigilante justice to the bad elements in their own communities.  Since for the most part, women can walk the street without being raped. And since I have <span class="caps">NEVER </span>seen someone so stupid as to stand on the corner hustling drugs. In general, Since <span class="caps">THEY CONDEMN THEIR OWN. </span> I don&rsquo;t feel any African American has to date earned the right to criticize them.  You have alot to learn from them.  Don&rsquo;t believe me?  Tell some of the Criminals in your community to jump on a airplane.  We will see how many make it back home.  </p>

					<p>&#8220;You make me ashamed to be white.&#8221; from some meathead called Craig.</p>
<p>Oh no, Craig, you didn&rsquo;t need that article to make you feel ashamed.  You&rsquo;ve already felt the shame for a long time now, swallowing all of the artificial guilt whole, never questioning what you read and hear from the controlled media.  You&rsquo;re not capable of independent thought, it&rsquo;s so much easier to let the smiling, confident face of the news anchor tell you what you should believe.  Why bother doing a little research on your own?  That&rsquo;s too much trouble and not worth your precious time.  Just let the establishment spin doctors pound the venomous lies about the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of multiculturalism and how &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221;  into your feeble mind 24 hours a day.   Never could you even attempt to consider the true nature of blacks as illustrated with the uttermost clarity in New Orleans.  No, that&rsquo;s too much for you.  You feel so ashamed, poor you.  That&rsquo;s it, nurture your self-hatred some more, feel the burning shame, feel what you&rsquo;ve been indoctrinated to feel.  Play the role you&rsquo;ve been assigned as your race is eventually shoved aside to make way for the future global plantation populated with millions of the future denizens of the world, Tan Everyman.  Yet I digress, because I&rsquo;m probably going over your tiny head with the previous sentence, so let me just say that if you really do refuse to stare reality in the face, then you deserve your shame.  Wallow in it, then step aside to let real, independent-thinking, confident Whites take the lead in saving our race by opening as many eyes as possible to warn us of the genocidal folly of multiculturalism. Wallow in it like the disgrace that you are.</p>

					<p>One of the posters said that balcks and whites all share the same unifrom and fight for the same country;</p>
<p> this is perhaps better seen in terms of the national gaurdsman&rsquo;s comment that he never thought he would be shot at by americans  &mdash;  -and the excellent response  &mdash;  he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Although I am sure that there are some dedicated black servicemen, what I remenber for the Vietnam era was &#8220;fragging&#8221;, i.e. black enlisted men murdering their own white officers.  Yes, they too were wearing the same uniform.</p>

					<p>Being a reporter myself, I know a superb job of organizing and writing a story when I see one. Mr. Taylor should be commended highly for his article on the New Orleans situation, and it should be re-printed in such places as Time, Newsweek, etc. But don&rsquo;t hold your breath until it is; they are busily putting the &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all Bush&rsquo;s fault&rdquo; spin on the story, as are all the mainstream news media. Their minds are made up; don&rsquo;t confuse them with the facts.<br>
I grew up in a lower-middle class Midwestern family in a small town, without having any preconceived notions about race. There were a small number of black kids in our high school, and we got along <span class="caps">OK, </span>except that I noticed that the boys all went out of their way to be disruptive in class, and to chase white girls.<br><br>
It was when I entered the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Army that I first encountered &ldquo;the boys from duh hood&rdquo;  &mdash;  the big-city blacks for whom giving naive white boys a hard time was considered great sport, if not a rite of passage. I had problems with several of them, and the experiences left me with a bad taste in my mouth toward blacks that still lingers.<br><br>
I&rsquo;ve seen no reason to change my opinions of them since then. I leave them alone, and so far, the ones here in my hometown have left me alone. I&rsquo;ve read that many blacks won&rsquo;t participate in public blood-donor drives because they are afraid their blood will be used to help a white person. <span class="caps">OK,</span> Jake, you feel that way? Don&rsquo;t expect any donations from me to help the New Orleans blacks who acted like such savages. Let some of these filthy rich black entertainers and athletes help their own. I shed all my white guilt at about age 18.</p>

					<p>Whites went without the same things, Ronnie.  Gulfport and Biloxi are mainly white.  The power was out, the water wasn&rsquo;t drinkable, the food in the refrigerators was going rotten, and yet they did not shoot at rescue helicopters.  They did not loot stores of plasma TV sets.  They did not rape seven year-old girls.  They did not burn buildings down.  They did not murder each other over their cities&rsquo; dwindling supplies of crack cocaine.  They did not carjack ambulances.  They did not go to hospitals and hold nurses at gunpoint to get drugs.  The white policemen among them did not loot shoes from Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>When the tsunami ravaged southeast and south Asia last year, the Indonesians, Thais, Sinhalese and Tamils, who enjoy a standard of living far lower than typical even for the poorest American blacks were similarly without potable water, electricity, functioning emergency services, or fresh food.  They didn&rsquo;t riot.  The Tamils and Sinhalese in Sri Lanka hate each other, and yet the tsunami did not spark further civil unrest.  When Kyoto was damaged by an earthquake over a decade ago, Japanese did not loot, rape and burn.  Japan is home to many ethnic Koreans, but these were not attacked by mobs of Japanese.  When parts of Turkey were similarly damaged by an earthquake more recently, the Turks did not loot, rape or burn.  Greece, Turkey&rsquo;s main enemy, was one of the countries which sent aid.  Bangladesh is ravaged by a cyclone every few years.  The storm surge typically floods much of the country, drowning tens of thousands, and yet Bangladeshis do not run amock after their frequent natural disasters.  White towns full of working-class people are common in the US plains states, and these are occasionally destroyed by tornadoes.  There&rsquo;s no rioting, no arson, no looting or rape in the wake of these tornadoes. </p>
<p>For anybody else, a natural disaster is typically an opportunity for people to rise above themselves and help each other.  <br>

					<p>With regard to the remarkable behaviour of blacks in the New Orleans Superdome I wonder if I can be allowed to add the following:</p>
<p>A female friend of mine who was living temporarily in London after leaving South Afica before going to settle down in Canada used to talk to me about blacks and how it is wise to perceive them.</p>
<p>M****** said that when one sees blacks in a Western country one receives a totally false impression. The typical black in a European environment, she said, has had to adapt to an alien culture and when he does so presents behaviour which is not natural for him. He does so in order to survive in the place where he is at. The other people are moderately polite and therefore he is polite too.  </p>
<p>The same &#8216;assimilated black&rsquo;, M****** said, when transplanted to some other place where black genes are the majority component of the population structure rapidly &#8216;reverts to the wild&rsquo; and in fact does so in a hurry because now he has to survive in the new place.</p>
<p>Some historians have said much the same kind of thing about the Ancient Britons under Roman rule. They were under an alien Mediterranean influence and no doubt presented behaviour which was un-Celtic in order to succed in a Roman ruled environment. When the Romans left, these Romanised Britons stayed Roman-like for some years and then dropped the whole intellectual and cultual baggage. </p>

					<p>My view boils down to this: </p>
<p>Regardless of the conditions surrounding them, about 5% of whites will be Worthless: some of that 5% will be criminals (many of them rarely if ever violent) and some will be lazy and/or stupid. Then, another 10% of whites will be Worthless under awful conditions, when pressures break many people.</p>
<p>Blacks are a different kettle of fish. Depending upon the actual percentage of black African genes and the residual white culture holding some sway over their lives, some 20-25% of blacks will be Worthless (with a much higher <span>of the criminal part being violent than the white criminal part) under any conditions. To make matters worse, under awful conditions, another 45-50 </span> of blacks will be worthless. If only to try to protect themselves from the majority of their race which they know to be largely or fully savage, the remaining blacks rarely voice any disapproval of what their racial brothers and sisters do.</p>
<p>Because we are by nature compassionate and empathetic, whites tend to focus on seeing only the good in blacks and attempt to help the best black people live the best lives possible. And to make that easy on themselves, they ignore the statistics and the racial realities. Most white people I know are not fooled by the media&rsquo;s lies and distortions, but they are so determined not ot hurt the feelings of that nice old black lady they know, or that poor truly nice orphaned black girl, or that sincerely Christian young black man, that they will keep their mouths shut and hope for the best. Their hearts are in the right place, but their tender-heartedness is ultimately destructive not merely of their own families and communities, which are neccessary to help the minority of worthwhile black people, but to the very blacks that they wish to help.</p>
<p>The Marxist black <span class="caps">W.E.B.</span> DuBois wrote constantly about the Talented Tenth of black people. I believe that he, who had considerably less than 50% black African genes, revealed much more than he intended. I believe that deep-down DuBois felt that only about 10% of blacks, the Talented Tenth, were fully and truly fit for living in white society as complete equals. </p>
<p>If whites wish to protect and uplift the Talented Tenth of blacks, and the 20-30% right below them in terms of character and intelligence, then they must act to corral the savage African passions and cultural values of the majority of blacks. And that will require a very firm hand, and then an end to all programs that discrimiante against whites and make blacks continue to feel that they are special and deserve special rights and privileges.</p>

					<p>I have to say, the racial component of the New Orleans disaster was far worse than I would have suspected.  I have always been a realist when it came to race, but I also always tried to be fair and give people the benefit of doubts.  But this has removed the last vestige of liberalism that remained in me.  There is an undeniable chasm between blacks and whites, in customs, in aptitude, in disposition, in character, and in intellect  and those differences are ultimately reflected in conduct.</p>
<p>Sure there is good and bad in every race.  But it is the percentages that matter most.  A functional white society can deal with the 3 percent that is dysfunctional, but a minority white population cannot deal with a majority black population that is dysfunctional.  A once quaint predominantly white New Orleans spent decades trying to absorb a huge black population, and in doing so destroyed itself. <br>

This is because the behavior of many of the <span class="caps">N.O. </span>citizens flies in the face of what the left have convenced themselves is the truth about black victimization. I do agree with some posters, that this behavior will go a long way to influence the thinking and attitudes of many whites, who heretofore felt guilty believing what they knew to be true about black genetics&hellip;..Craig, don&rsquo;t feel ashamed&hellip;you&rsquo;re <span class="caps">NOT REALLY </span>white, you&rsquo;re grey, like your idea of right and wrong! </p>

					<p>Life teaches us hard lessons in hard ways. At the age of 18 I got into some trouble with some friends of mine in our suburban neighborhood and I was sentenced to some time in jail. No one was hurt and in retrospect it could be attributed to youthful foolishness. A hard lesson to learn, but I learned it.</p>
<p>In jail I decided never to make those mistakes again so I studied hard and received a business degree with honors. After my release I opened my own business and now I own a successful company and doing very well financially. </p>
<p>Although the world of prison and crime is far behind me, the lessons I learned in prison will never leave me. A major lesson is <span class="caps">WHITES </span>and <span class="caps">BLACKS </span>are <span class="caps">DIFFERENT</span>!!! What we have all seen during Hurricane Katrina did not shock me in the slightest, it merely substantiated a belief I already hold. Also it just so happens to be exactly what happens every time a crisis breaks out anywhere in the world and the majority of the population happens to be black. Not my opinion or my belief, but obvious events and those people taking part in those acts.  Once again, not my opinion, but obvious observed facts. </p>
<p>One of the most shameful occurrences of this crisis is how  Leftist black politicians put no blame whatsoever on the black community for these atrocities. Are you kidding me!!!!! Open your f***in eyes. When is one black politician on the Left (there are some good black public figures, but none of them are Leftist politicians) going to condemn the acts of their own people and stop blaming everything on Whites. A black rioter rapes and kills a young woman and somehow it is some white guys fault.  I was listening to a top radio talk show and a black gentleman called in and went on a tirade about the shame that the black community in New Orleans has brought on itself. He was even more irate at Black politicians and how they blame everything on whites. He pointed out the obvious and said look at all the rescuers and look at all the looters. I commend him on his honesty and the only way for blacks in this world to survive is to have more men just like him.</p>
<p>In prison they behave just like animals and in the real world when given a chance also behave like animals. In my own day to day life I happily give anyone a chance to show me they are a good person and no matter their skin color, if someone shows me they are good then I will treat them as a good. However, people of the world need to wake up to the events of Katrina and the hard lessons this hurricane have taught us (the same lesson we get every time something like this happens). White America should be tired of the blind PC eye that turns its back on Whites. Whites are the ones who built this great civilization and Black Americans want to see it destroyed. That message is reiterated in their music, their culture and their belief systems, over and over and over again. This lesson we should al learn from Katrina is Whites need to protect themselves from Black society because given the chance they will immediately rape, kill and steal everything they can. We saw it in the LA riots and we will see it again and again until we (whites) stop shooting ourselves in our own foot by allowing our races existences to be so intertwined with other races that do not share our values and love for our great country. </p>
<p>The lesson that history has taught us is that diversity although politically and socially may seem good actually in the long run brings destruction. Diversity means different beliefs, morals, and motivations. That means it is difficult for society to get along and prosper. Of coarse this is good at a certain level because it encourages growth but not when it is force fed at a destructive pace and method. Israel is a good example of this fact and many other older civilizations have taught us this as well. A wise saying I heard once and I like to repeat is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t kill the horse that got you there&rdquo;. Whites have brought America to its level of success and now the PC world is trying to kill that horse. One day they will wake up, but it may be too late.  <br>

					<p>Regarding the part about 50,000 whites would have behaved at the Superdome:</p>
<p>Heck, I&rsquo;m old enough to recall how ~400,000 overhelmingly white people (mostly teens &amp; young adults) behaved outdoors in open country for several days, including heavy rain that turned the whole place into a giant mud pit. I&rsquo;m speaking, of course, of the Woodstock rock concert in 1969. Despite all the hardships mentioned above, there were only 3 deaths (two from drug overdoses and one from a fall, <span class="caps">IIRC</span>), and non-drug crime was virtually <i>zero</i>. </p>
<p>Was I there? No, I was only 14 at the time and was never a hippie anyhow. But anyone who was around back then can recall the TV news footage, and the documentary movie is available for anyone to rent or buy.</p>

					<p>This is racist trash.  The looters were a minority.  Looting is a time honored tradition ( be it a sad one) of all socities under inhuman conditions which this clearly is one.  Humans can live for three days without water.  It took five days for any emergency asssitance to arrive in any significant numbers.  It is easy for those of us sitting in clean, dry shelter with plenty of provisions to speak of how much better we would behave.  You were not there and you are not willing to put yourself in their shoes because of the color of their skin.</p>
<p>I read newspapers that showed pictures of whites with food items and called them people seeking and finding  food and pictures showing the exact same thing except they were black and of course they were looters.  There is a web site ngno.com, that shows pictures of whites leaving stores with sporting goods and golf clubs - looters or are they planning on eating those clubs?</p>
<p>In the past few years we have seen the <span class="caps">FEMA </span>response to Andrew and other hurricanes - <span class="caps">FEMA </span>setup to help before they even touched down.  What we saw this past week speaks volumes about America.  But not what you think.</p>

					<p>No offense, Craig, but that&rsquo;s your problem. Ronnie, wrong is wrong, regardless of who commits it. I&rsquo;d expect and want decent blacks to condemn wrongdoing by whites.</p>

					<p>All very interesting. But using the author&rsquo;s stats: population of NO is 480,000, 67% black, and 80,000 (black) citizens didn&rsquo;t leave the city&hellip; means that almost a quarter of a million (black) citizens did leave the city, didn&rsquo;t loot, didn&rsquo;t &#8216;sink into savagery&rsquo;, etc. Not to mention that of the 80,000 who stayed behind, many didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.</p>
<p>You folks here like to speak a lot about liberal &#8216;blindness&rsquo;, but anyone drawing conclusions about the black race based on the behavior of its criminal underclass during a reign of chaos is exhibiting some wilful blindness too.</p>

					<p>Did anybody get the <span class="caps">BEAUTY </span>in this article by Jared Taylor?</p>
<p>Oh, it was very well written all right.  And, it was probably the most complete article around to date.</p>
<p>But the genius of it is that it is a straight reportorial, unbiased report that never deviates from the truth one iota, and it covered the issues and events completely from the beginning to the present time, but, more importantly, it related the racial incidences without any hint of intended denigration, so that no fair minded person could claim it was an attempt at deprecating blacks, which they so often do even when such intent is absent.  </p>
<p>Masterful job, just as the C-Span presentation of the Color of Crime was a masterful job.  </p>
<p>Quite impressive on both counts to say the least.</p>

					<p>a detail: Mr.Chinthaka isn&rsquo;t telling the truth, there was looting and violence in Sri Lanka after the Tsunami though seemingly not on the scale of New Orleans and of a different nature. See this <span class="caps">BBC </span>page for more info:</p>

					<p><i>This is racist trash. The looters were a minority blah blah blah</i></p>
<p>Same excuse, different time.  Your PC mind tricks may have worked on most everyone in the past, but their inhernet bankruptness is becoming obvious to more and more people.  The only people who can continue to believe the sort of &#8220;poor people jes&rsquo; tryin&rsquo;a get by&#8221; tripe are the &#8220;Z&#8221; Magazine demographic.</p>
<p>Give it up.  No rational person - one who actually thinks for themselves and does not live in a tube zombie reality marked by sound bites from airhead celebrities and knuckle-dragging sports stars - can honestly believe that the situation in New Orleans was not largely due to race.  Are you honestly telling me that a natural disaster of the same type in Reykjavik would have engendered identical results?  Since you&rsquo;re a fool, you probably would.   <br>

					<p>Dear Leon, hey while I understand you want to blame the hurricane rioting on white people, it is a good idea if you want to represent your people you should use grammatical skills higher than a 3rd grader. Your spelling and sentence structure was so Ebonics it is beyond humorous, sad is more like it. <br>
Maybe you should read what your black brothers were doing to people in the Superdome, or everywhere else in NO for that matter? Have you no shame for the atrocities your people have committed? Is it white peoples fault as well that blacks could not contain their bloodlust and sexual depravity. <br><br>
Actually you are right it is all white peoples fault. It is our fault for bringing your worthless black asses over here and not taking you back when we were done with you. If you really want to be hated even more than keep up the good attitude?<br><br>

					<p>As a reporter for a daily newspaper at a small city here in the Midwest, tonight I covered a meeting of our city council in which one audience member after another got up to plead that we donate more money and goods to help the flood victims, mainly in New Orleans. People in our town have done a lot already for them, including sending down 100,000 pounds of goods to be distributed.<br>
Without exception, every altruistic person urging help for others was European-American  &mdash;  as were practically everyone at the meeting. Know how many blacks attended the meeting? One! And she said nothing at all about the hurricane, or helping her fellow blacks (never mind the whites  &mdash;  I knew she wouldn&rsquo;t ask anyone to help them). No, she came to the meeting to complain to the mayor that a club of which she is a member might not have a place to meet if the city buys a certain building it&rsquo;s closing a deal on.<br><br>
Isn&rsquo;t that typical? And is anyone surprised? </p>

<p>You sound like a white liberal dork, so I&rsquo;m assuming that&rsquo;s what you are, since you were too cowardly to use a name in your post.</p>
<p>What is it with types like you?  Apparently you&rsquo;re one of these self-hating whites that has been conditioned with Cultural Marxist propaganda to the point where you hate yourself and your race. It&rsquo;s been hammered into your head so much time and again over the years you couldn&rsquo;t think independently if you had to.  You&rsquo;re nothing more nor less than a conditioned robot that spews what you have been brainwashed with on cue, just like the conditioning imposed on Pavlov&rsquo;s dogs.  The bell of political correctness rings, and you salivate with politically correct dogma.  You have no choice.  You&rsquo;ve been programmed to respond that way.</p>
<p>The people on this site have been hammered with the same repetitious rubbish you have received, but the difference is that you&rsquo;re too weak-minded and gullible to form your own opinions on objective evidence, so you lash out and call people racists who do not agree with the trash bouncing around like a BB in your head, and we have the intelligence and the objectivity to weigh matters ourselves and draw our own conclusions, rejecting any propaganda that is designed to force us to think a certain way.</p>
<p>White people do bad things too.  Nobody says anything differently, but you try and justify <span class="caps">ALL </span>criminal black behavior by pointing out some feeble exception of a white doing what is standard operating procedures for blacks in general.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you realize that most blacks despise you? Or are you one of those dorks who claims he can walk through a black neighborhood at night without being assaulted because you are white? And don&rsquo;t you realize that blacks all over the world act the same way they do here, even though they&rsquo;re given generous benefit packages.  They have the highest percentage of criminals and prison inmates in all Western countries, and they  have the lowest <span class="caps">I.Q. </span>of <span class="caps">ALL </span>the races, not just compared to whites.</p>
<p>Or are you the type in the news account that was beaten so severely by blacks he lost an eye, had his jaw broken, his ribs broken and his nose flattened against his face, yet said that he didn&rsquo;t blame the blacks he blamed his ancestors for being slave holders, which caused the white hatred in the blacks which caused them to beat him unmercifully.</p>
<p>Is there no degradation you will take from blacks that you will allow you to criticize them?</p>
<p>Sorry, boy, but your stupid rants won&rsquo;t go over here, because too many of us know exactly what the real world is all about, and we have experienced repeated incidences of black racism against whites and have been witnesses to it many, many times.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like you&rsquo;re too stupid to know what racism really is.  I wish you and your kind would be set right in the middle of a black area and made to live with them everyday. </p>
<p>Many like you will never admit that black racism is far greater than white racism no matter how many examples are shown you or you witness personally.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re about as disgusting as they come.  </p>

					<p>No matter how many hundreds of years Blacks have been, or will be, living in America alongside Whites, they will never change.<br>
Africans will be Africans.<br><br>
You can take the Black out of Africa, but never change the true nature of the Black. 400 some odd years in America has proved that.<br><br>
They act the same way, whether they are in the Congo, Chicago, or Paris.</p>
<p>What I have noticed, is that these loud-mouthed, cocky Blacks I have seen on television in the recent days, seem to have had a much too easy, good life.  They can&rsquo;t tell me that they&rsquo;ve had it rough.  Not one day.  Many are extremely obese and obnoxious, which also tells me that our welfare benefits are just too good.<br>
Those people don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to have been hungry one day.  If they scream loud enough, they get what they want.<br><br>
Mistreated, my foot. </p>
<p>If they weren&rsquo;t bad enough to begin with, we have tolerated their bad behaviour and given them handouts all their lives. </p>

					<p>As a (hopefully) rational White Man, I find wry amusement in the silly rantings of &#8220;Appalled and Horified&#8221;, &#8220;Craig&#8221;, &#8220;Carver&#8221; and their like.  One can only wonder how anyone can be so thoroughly brainwashed and/or befuddled to disregard what they see and hear.</p>
<p>Our city (Houston) took in well over a hundred thousand of these refugees (some came in their own cars). I can only wonder how soon the proclivity for crime that is so much a part of the Black psyche will manifest itself here. I&rsquo; sure we won&rsquo;t have to wait all thsat long before the crime stats start getting reported.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t understand the mental processes (if that term is even applicable) of the aforementioned posters who would probably watch their daughters raped and then just pass it off as a hormonal imbalance on the part of the rapist. If these wonderful, compassionate posters ever had their precious delusions shattered by hard reality, they&rsquo;d probably be so distraught and devasted they&rsquo;d end up in mental hospitals.</p>
<p>Many, if not all of those fired were <span class="caps">SET</span>! Face it, with no electrical power, how would the fires have spntaneously started. Certainly chemical action would hardly be the cause in <span class="caps">ALL </span>instances. As to shooting at police and helicopters?  Stealing everything they could carry, by these Blacks?  What <span class="caps">DOES </span>it take to open the eyes of these sanctimonious people?</p>
<p>The popular trend is to blame politicial inaction for taking so long to respond. Has anyone considered that it takes a finite amount of time to mobile National Guard members, load trucks with supplies, and come to the aid of the people in <span class="caps">N.O.</span>? Yes, some blame can and should fall on the Louisiana Governor and <span class="caps">N.O.</span> Mayor. They could have used school buses to move people. Yet the haunting question is: How many Blacks chose to remain behind <span class="caps">DELIBERATELY, </span>knowing full well that ample opportunities to loot, steal, rape and rob would present themselves? Haven&rsquo;t we seen such acts accompanying every riot, every natural distaster? And <span class="caps">ALWAYS </span>the act of Blacks?</p>
<p>If those sanctimonious posters are indeed so appalled and horified by what they read on AmRen, perhaps they should not bother to visit this web site. After all, AmRen simply tells the truth, politiclaly incorrect though it might be.</p>

					<p>I am going to make a suggestion to you people because it is clear you lack the faculties to make reasonable decisions on your own,  Leave your little snakepit here at AmRem and visit mainstream sources such as major newspapers and magazines on the Internet.  Time, Newsweek and <span class="caps">U.S</span> World all have the Hurricane Katrina catastrophe as their cover stories this week.  Read these articles if you can, though some of you will only be able to look at the pictures.  (AmRem hosts a lot of semiliterate persons.)    The point of this exercise is to help you disabuse yourselves of the notion that your interpretation of this situation is shared by anything other than a miniscule part of the populace.  A minority of displaced people in New Orleans looted, including some of the white minority.  (The pictures are there, though people like you pretend they aren&rsquo;t.)  Drug addicts, sex offenders and other criminals were doubtlessly represented among the 30,000 and 20,000 people in the Superdome and Coliseum.   Such persons are always represented in any group of more than a few people.  (That includes AmRem.   In fact, white supremacists have a high incidence of felons among them.)   But, tales of violence have been greatly exaggerated.  The medical examiner reports that most people who died in the stadiums were victims of respiratory failure.  Rape?  Not one story of rape has been corroborated.</p>
<p>So, we know what the big story of Hurricane Katrina is not.   We also know what the big story of Hurricane Katrina is.  It is a tale of government malfeasance that resulted in untold suffering and possibly the deaths of as many as 10,000 innocent Americans.  Let me take back the &#8216;we.&rsquo;  Most Americans know these two things, but not present company.  Most Americans&rsquo; knowledge of a government gone monstrously awry has resulted in an unprecedented outpouring of concern and support for the thousands of evacuees.  That outpouring of concern and support is a key component of any mainstream reportage about this tragedy.  It is also the truth you will not learn at AmRem.   Instead, Jared Taylor has cobbled together accounts from other sources, inserting his own biases as if they were facts.   The point of his lies is to try to change the narrative into one that matches his white supremacist views   &mdash;   views that have no basis in science or reality.   He can no more prove that people of African descent are stupid and violent than he can sprout wings and fly.</p>
<p>The legacy of Hurricane Katrina will be a greater vigilance about how our governments, at all levels, treat citizens.   That&rsquo;s reality.  Your fantasy about causing greater division among the American populace will fall flat on its face.  Even as we speak, Americans of all hues and religions are joining hands to help the most vulnerable among us, the evacuees of Hurricane Katrina, while you congregate here and shame yourselves by blaming the victims.  Look and learn.   </p>

					<p>- There is a concentration of violent black males living in some urban centres throughout America. </p>
<p>- There seems to be a number of left orientated black commentators who have confused the right wing agenda with their responsibility to condemn the actions of those they profess to speak for.</p>
<p>- In the previous two and a half centuries, Western civilisation made great advances in industrial technology. This has benefitted Europe and America financially. </p>
<p>- Crowds behave differently to individuals. </p>
<p>- Federal government and State government seem to have shifting lines of responsibilty in the <span class="caps">US.</span></p>
<p>- Americas was built with slave labour.</p>
<p>All the above are true to some extent, but they have been interlinked in strange ways to produce very odd conclusions. The disaster in New Orleans should not be used to pave the way for some illogical race war, anymore than the governments ineptitude is a reason to start a revolution.</p>

					<p>Society has continued to spiral down ever since <span class="caps">FDR </span>and his New Deal.  His welfare programs created an economic underclass that grows every year.  Hundreds of billions of our tax dollars have been thrown at the problem with little, if any, success.  Out of wedlock children tend to bring new generations of out of wedlock children about every 15 years.  Fewer than one-tenth of one percent of these citizens will become brain surgeons or rocket scientists.   Most will continue to draw some type of assistance for the majority of their lives.  Many will become criminals and go to prison,  I&rsquo;m beginning to believe that we take the gloves off and begin relocating folks who cannot follow the rules to tropical paradises like Diego Garcia where they can prey on each other and not on folks that follow the rules.  I&rsquo;m also beginning to question the value of a citizen, of any race, who will not work.  Assistance should be earned and not a God given right.  <span class="caps">AFDC </span>payments should be conditional on identification of the father and should not be extended for more than two children.  Fathers should be required to work and a portion of their wages should be garnished to repay the government for their actions.  The past few days have done a lot to destroy the liberal myth about black governmental administration abilities.  Clearly New Orleans did not have an adequate plan to cope with a large hurricane, they did not have an adequate plan to evacuate its underclass, they did not have adequate supplies at the Superdome or the Convention Center and they did not maintain law and order until Federal troops began shooting back.  When looting began the police should have shot looters on sight.  It would have cost a few lives but it would have sent a message to the non-criminal element and it might have saved the city.  Now American taxpayers face a $200 to $400 billion price tag to fix and rebuild an area that could have been fixed for $20 billion had Congress appropriated everything the Corps of Engineers wanted over the last 20 years.  But hindsight is always 20-20,</p>

					<p>&#8220;What we saw this past week speaks volumes about America. But not what you think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like I said in another post - the far-left and blacks will use the New Orleans floods as another example of white racism.  It&rsquo;s their way of psychological warfare against us.  And notice, how this anonymous anti-white &#8216;warrior&rsquo; uses the dual photographs (&#8216;taking&rsquo; versus &#8216;looting&rsquo;) in his attack.  The left has become masterful at using media pieces like the two photographs to feed and drive their anti-white propaganda efforts.  To measure how big the dual photograph has become I guarantee you that sizable portion of regular people and majority of leftist people will use in an argument with you to advance anti-white arguments.</p>
<p>Killings don&rsquo;t matter.  Rapes don&rsquo;t matter.  Stealing doesn&rsquo;t matter.  Violence doesn&rsquo;t matter.  Photograph labels matter.</p>
<p>Look at how whites are being driven out of South Africa - a combination of low level warfare (black crime) and &#8216;liberal&rsquo; anti-white media efforts from within and without.  South Africa is what North America is going to become if whites continue with their present course. </p>
<p>Arguments need to be framed in white defence.<br>
Whites need to unify and attack all white traitors and purge them.<br><br>
Non-whites need to be treated like competitors.</p>
<p>Why support the center when the center does not support you? </p>

					<p>I am a <span class="caps">REFUGEE </span>from New Orleans. Thank God for Texas, thank God we had the sense to get out. Katrina has turned out to be just another opportunity, albeit a great one, for America and the West to wake up from the stupor of the integration nonsense. However, it is obvious that &#8220;There are none so blind as those who will not see.&#8221;<br>
 <br><br>
One thing that Mr. Taylor didn&rsquo;t mention and may not know is that during a near-miss hurricane about 3-4 years ago, the Superdome was used as an evacuation center. This was before Mayo Nagin&rsquo;s term of office, during the Morial administration Morial hasn&rsquo;t been back to La. in something like a year. He&rsquo;s under federal investigation and various family members of his have been indicted, etc., but you won&rsquo;t hear about that on TV when they receive his wisdom from the mountaintop.<br><br>
Anyway, when the City of NO used the Superdome as an evacuation center the last time, they had near-riots in the Dome because: 1) they didn&rsquo;t get food to the mob fast enough;<br><br>
2) when the food got there, it was hot dogs, which seems to have offended their palates, even though  &mdash;  -OF <span class="caps">COURSE</span>  &mdash;  -IT <span class="caps">WAS FREE</span>; and<br><br>
3) the mob was required to remain in the Dome until the City decided it was safe enough to let them go (which, as we now can say with certainty, means until they could be prevented from looting).</p>
<p>When the poor innocents were in fact allowed to leave the Dome,SOME <span class="caps">FOUR YEARS AGO, THEY STOLE EVERYTHING THAT WASN</span>&#8220;T <span class="caps">BOLTED DOWN.</span> TV cameras caught them leaving with sofas and bar stools and everything else that could be moved. Thus, the lack of planning for security and food in the Dome this time around is utterly unbelievable. The City and State (and <span class="caps">FEMA </span>as well) supposedly spend our money studying hurricane responses, what was successful, what was not. They have no one to blame but themselves for the current Dome fiasco.</p>
<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t believe any nonsense from the State of LA or the City of NO about the Superdome&rsquo;s being so dammaged by our &#8220;fellow citizens&#8221; that it is a bio-hazard and must be destroyed. That is simply a play to get the feds to pay for a new stadium for the Saints, which Saints owner Tom Benson has been demanding for years.   </p>

					<p>June Gordon demonstrates the thinking of the brainwashed masses.  Use Time, Newsweek etc. as the &#8216;real&rsquo; sources of news, of opinion.  Sure. These rags are owned and run by those that hate whites.  So of course they&rsquo;ll present the images of the odd white looter, while leaving out the images of whites murdered by blacks in the Terrordome, not to mention other African style sports played out by one of America&rsquo;s most precious, protected groups, next to hispanics of course.  Keep Time and other garbage to yourself, June.  The decades of lies and brainwashing from these organs of the elite may have worked on you and your ilk, but for the rest of us, the real news at <span class="caps">AMREN, </span>the news from the net, beats sophomoric propaganda published by the red diaper grandkids any day of the week. Facts are facts.  The behavior demonstrated by the blacks in the &#8220;Big Easy&#8221; is innate.  Period.  No one with any sense, no one grounded in realism should be surprised at what we have seen so far.  </p>

					<p>&#8220;Leave your little snakepit here at AmRem and visit mainstream sources such as major newspapers and magazines on the Internet. Time, Newsweek and <span class="caps">U.S</span> World all have the Hurricane Katrina catastrophe as their cover stories this week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps you lack the reading ability to make out the bylines on news stories. Amren has posted Katrina stories from the following: </p>
<p>The New York Times<br>
London Mirror<br><br>
Jamaica Star<br><br>
<span class="caps">USA</span> Today<br><br>
Chicago Tribune<br><br>
London Times<br><br>
Seattle Times</p>
<p>&#8220;Read these articles if you can, though some of you will only be able to look at the pictures. (AmRem hosts a lot of semiliterate persons.)&#8221;</p>
<p>Such as? It&rsquo;s fun to call names, but argument depends upon more than mere assertion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The point of this exercise is to help you disabuse yourselves of the notion that your interpretation of this situation is shared by anything other than a miniscule part of the populace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which of these stories contains reliable data about how these events have been interpreted? Unless they&rsquo;ve provided reliable survey data (which is most unlikely), all they&rsquo;ve got is someone&rsquo;s editorial/ideological slant. It is interesting that the academy and the media have already fretted about &#8220;racist&#8221; interpretations of Katrina. Why do you think that is? No one worries about what &#8220;a miniscule part of the populace&#8221; is likely to believe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also know what the big story of Hurricane Katrina is. It is a tale of government malfeasance that resulted in untold suffering and possibly the deaths of as many as 10,000 innocent Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among other things, it is a tale of the incompetence and corruption of black politicians. The mayor of New Orleans is a stupid, useless hack even by the etoliated standards of black politicos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most Americans&rsquo; knowledge of a government gone monstrously awry has resulted in an unprecedented outpouring of concern and support for the thousands of evacuees.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what? That has no bearing on the question. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Instead, Jared Taylor has cobbled together accounts from other sources, inserting his own biases as if they were facts. The point of his lies is to try to change the narrative into one that matches his white supremacist views   &mdash;   views that have no basis in science or reality. He can no more prove that people of African descent are stupid and violent than he can sprout wings and fly.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one who inhabits the phenomenal world and is in his right mind needs Mr. Taylor to know that blacks are stupid and violent. Every bit of real-world data and experience proves it.</p>

And lets not forget the all the wonderful buildings and structures they construct. Architectural Gems!</p>
<p> In Detroit, one can witness Pyramids being built and the Architectural genius that Ramses witnessed.  You are right June.  You have convinced me.

<p>Wait a minute? Maybe, just maybe, June is practicing a new Religion.  June, Political Correctness is a Religion.  You are accepting everything based on faith.  You are attacking us for being heretics. It is as simple as that.</p>
<p>June, awakening you is impossible.  You are defective equipment.  I won&rsquo;t bother trying.

					<p>Yes, Ronnie, I&rsquo;m almost certain I would feel safe around most of the people you are talking about in South Boston. I&rsquo;ve lived in a couple of neighborhoods that were majority lower-income white or blue-collar. There were no random street crimes. A few people did indeed do drugs, but they didn&rsquo;t sell them and they generally left other people alone. It was still a safer place than the majority black and black-run county, with a large, growing black middle-class, that it was located in(only at the extreme northern tier of the county, thank god)The few whites that did cause trouble there were teenaged w*ggers who were obviously influenced by black sub-&#8216;culture&rsquo;. Those would be the only people to watch out for in those neighbohoods. It&rsquo;s not only about class, Ronnie.</p>

					<p>Mr. Taylor states &#8220;When blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western Civilization &mdash; any kind of civilization &mdash; disappears.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, not entirely. Let&rsquo;s look at one example out of many when during Jim Crow and segregation when &#8220;Blacks were left entirely to their own devices&#8221;. In Tulsa Oklahoma in 1921, there was a segregated housing and business district known as the &#8220;Black Wall Street&#8221;.  The 35-block area boasted 191 Black-owned businesses that created an unprecedented 10 Black <span class="caps">MILLIONAIRES.</span> As many as 600 Black families in Tulsa at that time had assets as high as $500,000. Forget 1921, this type of economic success would be impressive today!!!</p>
<p>Of course, you know what happened. There was seething resentment of this success in the White business community because this kind of Black success was costing them millions. In May of 1921, in what became known as the Tulsa Race Riot, thousands of Whites stormed the Black Wall Street neighborhoods and destroyed everything in their path.  Hundreds of Blacks, including doctors, lawyers, business owners, retailers, seamstresses, blacksmiths etc. were shot, burned alive, or tied to cars and dragged to death.  By the time the violence ended, hundreds were dead &#8220;Black Wall Street&#8221; was completely destroyed. Blacks were forced once again to go to White-owned businesses for goods.  Today, in 2005, that same business district consist of <span class="caps">ONE </span>single block.</p>
<p>The moral of the story?  The White elite <span class="caps">WANT</span> Black people to be dependent on them and historically, any attempt and Black economic independence has been crushed. The White elite will not <span class="caps">ALLOW </span>an independent Black economic engine.  This is why historically the Klan torched Black-owned stores and business so Blacks would have nowhere to shop but at the White-owned establishments. This is why the prosperous Black township of Rosewood, Florida was destroyed.  The White elite always used lower-class Whites as their foot soldiers to maintain their economic power.  The whole Black-White economic situation in New Orleans has been manipulated.  The White business elite need a steady supply of uneducated, low-skill workers to maintain the engine of the tourist industry. And just as Jesse Jackson and other &#8220;civil rights&#8221; leaders depend on poor Blacks for their livelihood, so do the White business elite in order to maintain their economic standing (same applies to Mexico.  Why do you think we leave our borders wide open?  But that&rsquo;s another issue&hellip;). Can Blacks do more to break this cycle?  Yes, and some have (please pick up any issue of Black Enterprise magazine or read how Bob Johnson of <span class="caps">BET </span>became a Billioniare from a $15,000 investment), but so many more are stuck in perpetual poverty, which creates the resentment that those like Rev. Jackson feeds off of and leads to crime and looting.  </p>
<p>So I respectfully disagree with Mr. Taylor&hellip;historically there are examples of Blacks who have done very well when left to their own devices (Auburn Avenue in Atlanta, Beale Street in Memphis, Black Wall Street in Tulsa, Rosewood in Florida etc.).  But <span class="caps">INTEGRATION </span>(which made the White business elite even <span class="caps">MORE </span>wealthy) and economic manipulation destroyed all of that and led to areas like the &#8220;Nasty 9W&#8221; - the New Orleans 9th Ward.  This whole situation is manipulated.  As my great grandmother used to say, &#8220;Black people ain&rsquo;t runnin&rsquo; nuthin&rsquo; in the country but their mouths!&#8221; </p>

					<p>I just read the comments about Blacks in New Orleans and the crime rate, I was appalled by the derogatory comments directed at Blacks and New Orleans Police force in general.I agree that the shooters and rapers, and killers should be brought to swift justice with the severest of penalties. I disagree whole heatedly that you can say all blacks contributed to the atrocities committed in New Orleans. This is not about race it&rsquo;s about America and American citizens, No one has the right to point fingers at anyone. Personally I don&rsquo;t believe we are ready for Katrina, and this is what caused the slow reaction, however many states have opened their arms to the survivors of hurricane Katrina and the pouring out of love is a welcome sight compared to the prejudiced suffered by Blacks,and poor whites in the past. Lets not point fingers, or fight about this lets just join hands and do whatever we can to rectify the situation</p>

					<p>This is very interesting. I visit this web site to entertain myself with the vile, viscious, repugnant, moronic statements that white bigots post. Nothing gets them foaming at the mouth like misbehaving blacks. I can&rsquo;t wait for another red peice of meat(minorities disappointing them)to be tossed their way. I love it! I love it! Hurrican Katrina was the greatest catch yet for them. Do they sit around in their living rooms with score cards grading black behavior and comparing notes. What a silly class of folk! Debating one of you fools would be like taking candy from a baby. </p>

<p>If you think you&rsquo;re going to get the truth from the mainstream media you&rsquo;re some feeble-minded dork who obviously lives in the twilight zone.  You like to claim that you represent mainstream thinking, when, in fact, many suveys and polls have indicated 67% of American citizens do not have any confidence in receiving the truth from the <span class="caps">MSM. </span> Their circulation figures <span class="caps">ARE ALL DROPPING.</span></p>
<p>Countless high profile people take it as a given that most of the media has a left wing bias, and many of them are nothing more than radical leftist rags.  It&rsquo;s common knowledge.  Except to you, of course, and those of your ilk.  </p>
<p>Bill <span class="caps">O&rsquo;R</span>eilly chuckles often when he relates an incidence where some <span class="caps">P.C. </span>radical is so out-of-touch with the real world he/she actually believes what they say and do is mainstream.  It&rsquo;s delusional, right along with other mental deficiencies that cause the person afflicted to fail to recognize black and Hispanic racism, their high crime rate, their hatred of whites and of this country, and their inability to achieve anything on their own, as well as the fact that they have the lowest intelligence, not just compared to whites, but of any race on earth. </p>
<p>The words that come out of your mouth, or from your mind, comes from a person that is so mentally diseased and conditioned to respond a certain way, all reason and logic is absent, and, in its place, is the drum beat of robotic programming.  Like the other disgusting liberal dork, you&rsquo;re just another lab dog that has been conditioned to salivate upon cue.  You have no objectivity about you, and, sadly, above all, your delusional dementia, in addition to your gullibility and programmed responses, are the serious contributing factors as to why you are unable to logic in coherent terms, as well as recognize that anybody with an opposing view could be right.</p>
<p>All of us here have been deluged with the same propaganda and lies you have been beseiged with over and over and over again.  But unlike you, we can observe an incident, a situation or a condition in an objective way and reach a valid conclusion as to the truth of the matter.  That is <span class="caps">IMPOSSIBLE </span>for you. Indeed you are programmed and sick, but above all you are about as pitiful as a person can get.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ashamed that you are a fellow white, so ashamed I&rsquo;m absolutely and completely totally disgusted with you.  At some point in your life if you begin to heal, you will look back at your rabid, inane assertions, and you will be completely ashamed of yourself, as you should be if you have any decency at all about you. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the type who wants a rainbow coalition of smiling faces to hold hands, drink a coke and sing in perfect harmony, stupidly unaware that the other races want nothing of the sort and the majority of them regard you as some kind of dim wit and will show true allegiance only to their fellow tribesmen.</p>
<p>You claim everyone can get along if it weren&rsquo;t for people like us.  Let me suggest to you that if we survive as a people at all it will be because of people like us, in spite of people like you.  Those other smiling faces in the rainbow do not want equality, love and tolerance.  They want control and dominance, and they can hardly contain their glee, because sick fools like you are giving them just what they want.</p>
<p>No multicultural nation in the history of mankind has survived, with most of them erupting into bloody warfare.  This nation will do the same, and when it happens, I sincerely hope that people like you will be caught up in a &#8220;diversity&#8221; zone so you can get the full effect of it all and realize to your horror how wrong you were.</p>
<p>We are now in the initial phase of low intensity conflict, described as 4th generation warfare, because of the battling between tribes and against authority at the same time by minority tribes who show only allegiance to their tribal members and reject any loyalty to the nation state, and in fact, are at war with authority and other tribes.  An example is the black/Hispanic conflicts which are ongoing right this moment, and are accelerating in intensity and number.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t think objectively, at least take your head out of the sand long enough to see what&rsquo;s really going on in the real world.</p>
<p>4th generation warfare will eventually evolve to  Civil War <span class="caps">II, </span>which will cause a complete break up of America.</p>
<p>If that scares you, and you want to stick your head back in the sand, by all means do so.  But don&rsquo;t rave and rant to people on this web site who are trying their best to reveal the truth, because you&rsquo;re too big a fool to recognize what the truth really is.</p>
<p>Maybe you could take up cutting out paper dolls as a hobby, instead of chaining yourself to other fools who scream hysterically, froth at the mouth, kicking and protesting frantically, because somebody else has a different opinion than you and you feel you must do what you do to fight fanaticism and extremism, stupidly not realizing that what you say and do is the best example possible of out-of-control, demented maniacs.</p>

					<p>Kenelm Digby states:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Ronnie,<br>
I would feel happier and safer in a disaster in the company of any given random White, be it a garbage collector or a lawyer, than I would be in the company of a Black PhD or a Black <span class="caps">MBA.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>May I venture to say that I doubt you&rsquo;ll know <span class="caps">WHO </span>you&rsquo;ll feel happier and safer around in a disaster until you&rsquo;ve actually been in one. I&rsquo;ve known very few people who feel happy or safe in the midst of any disaster, no matter whose around. Those who have accept help wherever they can get it, no matter who they get it from. I suppose that&rsquo;s why all of those allegedly &#8220;racist&#8221; Blacks where hugging, crying on, and thanking their White rescuers in this most recent disaster or why there where White people who were so tearful and thankful in indidences in which several Black firefighters and policemen got them to safety during 911.</p>
<p>Second, if you&rsquo;re so timid that you&rsquo;re scared of a Black PhD or Black <span class="caps">MBA,</span> I can actually understand now why White nationalists are saying White people are becoming such &#8220;wusses&#8221;. I suppose in a disaster the Black <span class="caps">MBA </span>will undergo a &#8220;Hulk-like&#8221; transformation and instead of quoting stock prices from the private equity markets, he will devolve into a savage Zulu warrior, and the Black PhD is going to lose his &#8220;veneer of civilization&#8221; and devolve into his &#8220;innate savagery and Africanisms.&#8221;  Africa??  He&rsquo;s probably a dorky intellectual from Connecticut.</p>
<p>Third, from your statement, I doubt you&rsquo;re around any Black people anyway, regardless of whether they have PhD&rsquo;s or <span class="caps">MBA&rsquo;</span>s, so no worries. You&rsquo;ll be fine with your own &#8220;random&#8221; kind. <br>
But I understand the deal. When the Black &#8220;criminal element&#8221; acts a fool, <span class="caps">ALL</span> Black people are tarred and feathered with the same brush and have to pay the price.  But hey, as long as we keep all of our hatred and attention on those &#8220;uncivilized Black people&#8221;, we&rsquo;ll don&rsquo;t have to worry about the pedophile who moves in right next door to us&hellip;..<br><br>

<p>I too find this to be rather disheartening as well. One of the most appealing things about this forum and AR in general, is the fact that all European/Caucasian groups are considered white, including Jewish people. It is far too simplistic to blame one specific ethnic group for all of our peoples&rsquo; woes. Or put another way, the last time I looked El Presidente George W. Bush, is not given to wearing a yarmulke when he goes to his normal religious services.</p>
<p>As I like to always point out, there is blame enough to go around at the top when it comes to the competitive altruism sellout game!</p>

					<p>To Comrade June Gordon, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A minority of displaced people in New Orleans looted, including some of the white minority. (The pictures are there, though people like you pretend they aren&rsquo;t.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, I have seen recorded images of these so-called white looters, interesting how they all seem to be focused on obtaining food and other necessities of survival. Not many photos or videos of mobs of hooting and grinning whites with plasma televisions and <span class="caps">DVD </span>players however.</p>
<p>Funny that?</p>
<p>Just something to think about Comrade! </p>

					<p>Whites rescuing blacks, white medical personnel remaining in hospitals to help while looters point guns at them, whites who with little money, got it together and left, whites who are coping in other parts of the Gulf hard hit without much looting and raping, whites whose idea of how police, firemen and resuers should behave is taken from the pages of New York, 9/11; whites who create civilization despite all the reprehensible things. And this clow is &#8220;ashamed&#8221; of being white? He&rsquo;d be proud to be black. Well, it&rsquo;s easy to be black and proud. No matter what you do, you&rsquo;re proud.<br>
  btw, the other clown who said it was right that the blacks should beat him up because his ancestors held slaves  &mdash;  what if his ancestors had been abolitiionists? Or died in the Union Army? What deluded, brainwashed losers.</p>

					<p>Livin, that&rsquo;s interesting. You say &#8220;The behavior demonstrated by the blacks in the &#8220;Big Easy&#8221; is innate. Period. No one with any sense, no one grounded in realism should be surprised at what we have seen so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that behavior is we saw is &#8220;innate&#8221; to Black people. Poverty or class had nothing to do with it, right?  So those were a buch of lawyers, business owners, and doctors that we saw looting and raising mayhem.  And those Black guys who were going house to house on boats to rescue their neighbors&hellip;..was that &#8220;innate&#8221; behavior too?  And the image of the young Black dude carrying an elderly White woman up to the helicopter and giving her the last seat&hellip;.I guess that was &#8220;innate&#8221; too.  Is the National Guard General Russell Honore, who is Black, behaving in a way that is &#8220;innate&#8221; to Black people?  What about the Black guy who goes to work every day, goes to church, and does the right thing.  Will he make the news? No, because that&rsquo;s boring&hellip;it&rsquo;s not news. But let a Black criminal or thug do something that makes the news, and that&rsquo;s labled as &#8220;Black behavior&#8221; and &#8220;innate&#8221;.  So on judgement day, I have to go before <span class="caps">GOD </span>and give an account for all of my willful failings and sins. But all a Black guy has to say is, &#8220;Sorry, <span class="caps">GOD, </span>my sins and failings are innate&hellip;.I couldn&rsquo;t help myself!&#8221;  Hey, that ain&rsquo;t fair!</p>
<p>And the even more enlightening Cassiodorus says: &#8221; No one who inhabits the phenomenal world and is in his right mind needs Mr. Taylor to know that blacks are stupid and violent. Every bit of real-world data and experience proves it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cassiodorus, if your believing that Blacks are stupid and violent makes you feel better about your own unproductive life, go for it, buddy! That&rsquo;s the only glory you will ever have.  So to all of those Black military guys (and even a few gals) whose pictures I saw in last Sunday&rsquo;s paper listed as fatalities in Iraq and Afghanistan, I say to you, thank you for giving your life so Cassiodorus has the freedom to write in air-conditioned comfort about how &#8220;stupid and violent&#8221; you are!</p>

					<p>What a bunch of fool you are. <br>
Unlike you I&rsquo;ve been exposed to poor white people who have Meth pumped into their neighborhood. It&rsquo;s not any prettier than blacks and crack. <br><br>
Except drug addicted whites tend to go for sodomy and incest more than rapeing women. <br><br>
The violence, the histeria, the theft, it&rsquo;s all the same. </p>
<p>The problem is drugs. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to believe that. Then you&rsquo;ll just have to see for yourself when a bunch of white meth addicts move in on you and yours. </p>
<p>Where I live, our tax money is supporting Meth addicts. White trailer trash meth and crack addicts.  In every poor community we have these guys, black or white. <br>
The hurricane just happened to break lose in New Orleans on a predominantly black poor neighborhood. But, in many sections along the mississippi, it&rsquo;s the Meth addicts that we&rsquo;re worried about and they&rsquo;re 99% White.</p>
<p>The difference is, officers are in full force cracking down on these meth labs (8 or 9 a day!) Wow, yet like roaches they keep comming.  They don&rsquo;t try half as hard to crack down on the drug houses in the black communities, probably out of fear.</p>
<p><span class="caps">P.S.</span> Looks like the white woman in that picture should of dropped some morals and stole some damn diapers to cover her poor babies bottom.:(<br>
I guess her whiteness wouldn&rsquo;t let her do that though. What a joke you guys are.</p>
<p>Who cares if someone&rsquo;s stealing beer, or water, clothes, medicine, food, or whatever!</p>
<p>They just lost everything. They probably don&rsquo;t feel that they can depend on a bunch of racists to help them out so, why not help yourself. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you right now, if a big natural disaster goes down in my neck of the woods. I will take a gun to protect my family, and if they are hungry, I will take whatever food and water I can find. If my baby&rsquo;s bottom is exposed, I will take diapers and clothes, etc&hellip;. And, I would take it for my neighbor&rsquo;s family and children as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for your racist time. See you later ignorant fools.;)~</p>

					<p>Did someone say he is ashamed to be white, watching the <span class="caps">NOLA </span>horrors? How insane  &mdash;  like in bizarro world. What makes him ashamed? The white rescuers? The white college boys who formed circles around the white girls to prevent them from being raped or worst in the Superdome?<br>
  Low as the behavior of the blacks there is, and in spite of the fact that ruin every city where they become more than a small minority, I still don&rsquo;t think any decent black individual should feel &#8220;ashamed&#8221; of the behavior of bad blacks. We have no control over what other people do. The shame comes when we excuse the evil doers. They had the same advantages as any other American  &mdash;  free education, enough food to make them obese, etc. etc. Excusing them is an obscene lie, and blaming it on whites, many of whom have lost everything as well, is truly insane.</p>

					<p>Yo!..June Gordon! I won&rsquo;t attempt to dissuade you from your contempt for the white race which is evident in your posting. <span class="caps">HOWEVER, </span>before you criticize the literacy of others it would serve you well to learn a little more about English grammar and composition. Your writing is rife with punctuation errors and sentence fragments. Please, also have someone explain to you the proper use of parentheses. <br>
  Wait&hellip;what am I saying? A brilliant liberal like you finished learning new things long ago. <br><br>
  I&rsquo;ll bet that you were really proud of your comments, too. How does it feel to be faced with the horrible truth that you&rsquo;re not the stellar intellect that you believe you are?<br><br>
  What&rsquo;s that? You&rsquo;re now consoling yourself by admitting that less than perfect grammar doesn&rsquo;t necessarily disqualify one as a genius? Kind of hard to justify your stance now, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

In your demented little mind, do you think that these &#8220;uncorroborated&#8221; stories of rape, murder, beatings, and all around predatory behaviour was some sort of &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; that these tens of thousands of individuals somehow and someway <span class="caps">ALL </span>came together and decided to foist upon idiots, like yourself?

					<p>QJoe, where is the behavior of blacks in the Big Easy different from blacks anywhere else in the world once there is no (white) law around to lend some semblance of order?  The behavior of blacks isn&rsquo;t different in NO from the other black cesspools on the planet because of the inborn behavior of blacks. Comparing the less than 1% of blacks involved in positive behavior in the situation to the less than 1% of white ne&rsquo;er do wells in the disaster zone is disingenuous at best.  Black countries, cities, neighborhoods and housing projects are horrible places, free zones for murderous, criminal behavior because of the innate cognitive make-up of blacks.  You didn&rsquo;t see this behavior in white areas after the hurricane hit.  You didn&rsquo;t see this in SE Asia after the Tsunami disaster last year.  You don&rsquo;t see this happen in white areas of Europe after a calamity.  But you see it in black areas, amongst black people, everywhere, when there is no outside authority holding things together.  Whether or not there has been some type of natural disaster.  Yes, this wanton, violent behavior is innate.  We suspect you know it is also.  </p>

<p>Why do you care what we racist ignorant fools think?  Your lecturing, labels, and attempts at guilt trips have no effect here.  I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re so concerned with what we think.  We&rsquo;re ignorant, right?  This is a free country and we have the right to say what we think here.  So go away and let us wallow in our racist ignorance.</p>
<p>The reason you posted here is because you know everything we say is the truth and you can&rsquo;t stand it that whites are starting to see blacks for what they really are - animals.  I can tell you a whole lifetime worth of bad experiences I&rsquo;ve had with blacks starting with the filthy lowlife who exposed himself to me when I was fourteen years old.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you go try your name calling garbage on some liberal arts college educated brainwashed lilly white journalist whose only real life experience with blacks is what he&rsquo;s read out of a leftist slanted magazine.  I&rsquo;m sure it will work.</p>

					<p>My how so many shallow people respond to emotional outbust in psuedo intellectual style. Yeah yeah yeah there&rsquo;s lottsah of white trash out there and they also commit the nasties&hellip;&hellip;cause there will always be a group of lazy people period.</p>
<p>But never before has one ethnic group been so targeted by the elite as &#8220;perpetual victims&#8221; like these folks. Did the folks in the tsunami behave in this manner? You, nor the news media will address the total incompetence of the political leadership(or lack thereof)nor want to hold them accountable. </p>
<p>You jump with the emotional tripe about the blacks serving this country, you digress and are either very stupid or very smart.</p>
<p>The point is that 30 years and <span class="caps">BILLIONS </span>of dollars will never overcome the social apathy that results from a welfare society. It robs people of the incentive to make a life. That&rsquo;s why in Texas you&rsquo;ve got 2 years or else your out and rightly so.</p>
<p>The rest is merely utopian tripe and attacking the messenger about being racist when the picture is selfincriminating is disingenious and smells like the typical leftists poilticians that attack the messenger hoping people are to stupid to figure out the message.</p>
<p>The message is that <span class="caps">WELFARE</span> IS A <span class="caps">FAILURE, </span>the ethnic group could be anyone. Of all the ethnic groups I see immigrating to Houston only <span class="caps">ONE </span>group stands out as &hellip;&hellip;..what you saw on the boob tube&hellip;&hellip;.the rest suck it up and get work and scrimp and save and oh wait hell most of you all are that group this nation has a -0.6% savings rate..oh different topic but you get the point or you still beleive the Al Sharptons and Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s of this country..if you do well then there you have have it, you reap what you sow if you have an iota if spiritual discernment&hellip;..</p>

					<p>Of course, June Gordon is 100% right. The wonderful thing is that, as we speak, Americans of all stripes have contributed millions toward helping the victims. They know, as anyone with even a modicum of sense knows, that the looters comprised a minority of those who remained in New Orleans. Of course, the people here at AR like to delude themselves into thinking that &#8220;white America&#8221; is finally &#8220;waking up&#8221; and will want to have nothing to do with blacks. Of course, Jared Taylor and Co. have been repeating this mantra for years, and it has never happened. And never will. Americans, especially younger generations such as myself, are just as intolerant of such narrow-minded racism.</p>

					<p>June Gordon&hellip;.June Gordon&hellip;..a wonderful name.  I am sure you, Newsweek,Time and company own the truth.  I guess everything I saw growing up in Detroit was an illusion. You could be right.  I mean everywhere in America (or the world for that matter) that has any number of blacks automatically enters into joyous harmony.  And lets not forget the all the wonderful buildings and structures they construct. Architectural Gems!<br>
 <br><br>
 In Detroit, one can witness Pyramids being built and the Architectural genius that Ramses witnessed.  You are right June.  You have convinced me.  My eyes must have been deceiving me all these years.  I must be crazy. All the wisdom of the ages up until the last fifty years was a total lie.  <br><br>
 <br><br>
Wait a minute? Maybe, just maybe, June is practicing a new Religion.  June, Political Correctness is a Religion.  You are accepting everything based on faith.  You are attacking us for being heretics. It is as simple as that.<br><br>
 <br><br>
June, awakening you is impossible.  You are defective equipment.  I won&rsquo;t bother trying. You are the abused wife who pleads with the Police <span class="caps">NOT </span>to take her husband away after he beats the day lights out of her.  &#8220;He loves me   &mdash;  -he really loves me&#8221; she pleads with the officers as her black eye swells.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m sure the weekly newsmagazines are all on message with the &#8220;white guilt&#8221; talking points re Katrina. I&rsquo;m sure that they will downplay the fact that the vast majority of those killed or impoverished by Katrina were white, I&rsquo;m sure that they will downplay the scapegoating of whites left behind in New Orleans, and I&rsquo;m sure they will push the &#8220;government malfeasance&#8221; theme (or more precisely, the &#8220;Federal malfeasance&#8221; theme, since the more culpable state and local governments are controlled by Democrats.)</p>
<p>I watched this disaster unfold, in large part through streaming news reporting from New Orleans TV stations. I was astounded by the absolute incompetence of state and local officials, and by the underclass savagery shown by all too many blacks in New Orleans. The evolving media spin on the disaster   &mdash;   innocent blacks abandoned by callous whites   &mdash;   is so much the polar opposite of what I saw happening that I am astonished. Quite simply, you are asking me, &#8220;Who are you going to believe   &mdash;   the media, or your lying eyes?&#8221; </p>

					<p>To &#8220;AverageStudent&#8221;, I find you amusing.  For several reasons actually.  </p>
<p>First, your unilateral assertion that &#8220;June Gordon&#8221; is a 100% right when even an &#8220;average student&#8221; can clearly see extreme errors in her tirade.</p>
<p>Second, someone who apparently is young and in school and in the midst of liberal indoctrination coming here to profess how life really is.  </p>
<p>Third, your apparent awareness of Jared Taylor, AmRen, and the truth that is written on this website as well as the magazine.  Apparently, this site worries a tremendous amount of people, doesn&rsquo;t it?  </p>
<p>Fourth, your probable understanding that the readership here has exploded over the last decade or so and more over the last couple of years.  Obviously, people are interested in these &#8220;lies&#8221;, huh?</p>
<p>Fifth, your inaccurate generalization that all younger generations are intolerant of &#8220;narrow-minded racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>And finally, your need to spout off such inanity to people who do not matter.  Why is that?  <span class="caps">LOL </span></p>

					<p>Several general comments are appropriate in light of this wonderful piece of reportage and analysis by our heroic AR editor, Jared Taylor.</p>
<p>First, a warm appreciation to Mr. Taylor for his always insightful and supremely courageous stand in defence of what, objectively, can only seriously be called The Greatest Race. You may (or may not - I don&rsquo;t know) be an atheist, Mr. Taylor, but you are truly doing the Lord&rsquo;s work in bearing (Christian) witness to the awful truths of race in America, as well as perpetually calling attention to what can only be described as an evil war, albeit formally undeclared, of unprecendented viciousness, theft, callousness, and lies directed against utterly innocent white Americans. The Bible enjoins such witness; the fact that most self-styled Christians refuse to &#8216;speak truth to power&rsquo; on racial issues, merely shows what fools, cowards and traitors so many of them are. Christian race-liberals (including the idiots in the Christian so-called &#8220;Right&#8221;) should be ashamed of themselves. May you rot in Hell - or at least Purgatory - for a very long time!</p>
<p>Second, I am somewhat dismayed by the frequently poorly articulated responses of many pro-white respondents to this site. You people really should think before you mouth off. We have facts and logic wholly on our side; therefore we need only to put our &#8216;best feet forward&rsquo; eventually to convince our moderate racial brethren. <span class="caps">AR&rsquo;</span>s editors always do this, which is why they are having a positive impact, when so many other race-realists and patriots since the 1960s have little to show for their decades of activism. </p>
<p>Third, as a corollary to my second point, note I mentioned <span class="caps">MODERATE </span>fellow whites. By this I really mean mainstream conservatives, as well as such liberals whose liberalism is based on economic or sexual matters, as opposed to race. Racial liberalism, at least in light of the obvious total failure of coercive racial integration, as well as the manifest civilizational / behavioral inferiority of most of the non-white world, is clearly irrational (in a very basic evolutionary, as well as ethical, sense); indeed, one hardly exagerates in calling it the primary type of mental pathology of the post-modern era. Therefore, just as one cannot debate a conventional madman, it is probably counterproductive to engage in endless discussions with committed white multiculturalists. They are diseased; do you racialists actually expect to persuade them of your position?    </p>
<p>Fourth, never forget: Western Man is Ethical Man. White civilization is dying for no other reason than that most of our people are morally confused, and lack an adequate ethical justification for white racial consciousness and collective (as opposed to personal) defense. Supplying such a justification, while continuing the task of making our people aware of the ugly truths deliberately suppressed by the leftist media, is ultimately the preeminent task of our movement. We have not done it completely yet, but thanks to <span class="caps">AR, </span>we are closing in. </p>
<p>When whites finally realize they have the right to defend themselves and their heritage on a strictly racial basis, the world will be transformed, and rapidly. I intend to be there then.</p>

These people had time to prepare before heading to the Superdome.  She has a backpack on, so it looks like she obviously took the time to pack.  Did she not save enough time to clothe her baby?  Did a black person steal the baby&rsquo;s clothes?  Why would they steal the diaper also?  While the picture is very sad, it is at the same time a little difficult to figure out.  I am open for speculation if anyone is up to it.</p>

To June Gordon:</p>
<p>If you want to see a snake pit, I would suggest you visit any black community. In fact, move to get a feel for daily life. Go on, I dare you.</p>
<p>If you took the time to actually read the articles posted on this web page, you would see that they are all from main stream sources. And if you took the time to actually read the articles that are posted, you will actually see that few have any pictures at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A minority of displaced people in New Orleans looted, including some of the white minority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A clarification here; an overwhelming majority of the looters were black with a minority of whites. Please keep your facts straight if you wish to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;white supremacists have a high incidence of felons&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is this a fact or what you believe? Please site your source.</p>
<p>To be fair, here is one for you. Please read it through carefully:</p>
<p>http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/race.htm</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;tales of violence have been greatly exaggerated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please see link above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one story of rape has been corroborated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Numerous stories of rape and murder have been reported in the sources you named. You told us to read them because they were true. Are they true or are they not? Which is it? Tell us which main stream source to believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a tale of government malfeasance that resulted in untold suffering and possibly the deaths of as many as 10,000 innocent Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And do you know who is responsible for local disaster relief? The mayor. The mayor of the city is <span class="caps">FIRST </span>in line for emergency management. And guess who was in charge in New Orleans and who didn&rsquo;t have the sense to use buses to evacuate the neediest? A black man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s telling to me that a black mayor with 5 days warning couldn&rsquo;t get his act together. Contrast this with Rudolph Giuliani, a white man who had no warning about Sept. 11. Of course for you, a black man, by virtue of being a black man, isn&rsquo;t expected to perform at the same level as a white man. I certainly don&rsquo;t expect a black man to do what a white man can do and clearly, neither do you. You clearly see black men as being less capable and less responsible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead, Jared Taylor has cobbled together accounts from other sources, inserting his own biases as if they were facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sort of like what you&rsquo;re doing. I guess you views don&rsquo;t count either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point of his lies is to try to change the narrative into one that matches his white supremacist views&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how repeating the facts given by the main stream media sources that you sight becomes &ldquo;white supremacy&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;views that have no basis in science or reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I take it you must be deaf and dumb. I am not. I have eyes and ears that work and I can see and hear what is going on around me. Unlike you, I trust my senses. I don&rsquo;t second-guess them or make excuses for them or try to find theories to explain them away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look and learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do which is why I am here.</p>

					<p>I am of Indian origin and have lived in the US since 1993. I grew up in Zambia (Africa) and have witnessed the steady decline of Zambia as foreigners (Whites, Indians and others) departed the country over the years.</p>
<p>With firsthand account I can tell you that black people when left to themselves are incapable of making smart, strategic decisions when faced with adversities. The Katrina Hurricane has overwhelmingly demonstrated this fact. The black race tries to find others to blame first before looking at themselves. If the remaining sane whites of this country subscribe to the liberal pandering of racial equality and other such malarky spewed by these left-wing cuckoo hypocrites, the <span class="caps">USA </span>is going to descend in to the mess that is Africa.</p>

					<p>&#8220;I visit this web site to entertain myself with the vile, viscious, repugnant, moronic statements that white bigots post. &#8220;</p>
<p>Wow, what intellecual power in this statement.  This guy thinks that the more negative adjectives he drops in a sentence, the more his brilliant analysis gains in status at his local leftist anti-white group meetings.  </p>
<p>Dialogue is impossible with someone like this - they only want total white submission or white blood, nothing else will do.  They seek to be our masters and cannot handle it when we rebel - that&rsquo;s why the vile, viscious, repugnant, moronic name calling.  People like use projection (in the psychological sense) to build up mental processes with which to lash out at others - they are extremely dangerous.  In the ex-Soviet Union they were the <span class="caps">NKVD </span>types who killed countless others in the name of progress and solidarity.  Their violence never counted though - only the rebelling locals deserved what they got.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Of course, Jared Taylor and Co. have been repeating this mantra for years, and it has never happened. And never will. Americans, especially younger generations such as myself, are just as intolerant of such narrow-minded racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the issue of the younger generation and racism little more:</p>
<p>Liberal whites are not racist because it guarantees their privileges within western societies - why does this arrangment exist I ask?  Why do Western leaders/intellectuals align with actions/ideals that favour Asian and African people at the expense of European people?  Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>The problem is that there is never a status quo when it comes to race relations.  At the present, money flows from Euros and Asians to Hispanics and Africans, but there are other variables at play.  Demographics are more important.  Demographically whites are on the retreat and are losing ground at an astonishing speed.  Why do whites think losing demographic ground is good or even neutral?  Wait a minute, most whites (according to all polls) don&rsquo;t think that - yet our elites take actions that guarantee this outcome.  Once again we have this separation of &#8216;elite&rsquo; thinking and ordinary white thinking.  What is going on?</p>
<p>With every non-white immigrant the anti-white coalition gains new energy.  That is why immigration is a taboo subject to most non-whites.  Non-whites are <span class="caps">NEVER </span>racist in the West because they always call for liberal, open-border policies (which will coincindently favour them and their cousins). But&hellip; talk to the average Asian immigrant and an interesting picture starts to emerge.  Asians are still mainly joining the left (liberals, democrats - i.e. white haters), but they are keeping all options open, and talk (with some reservation) about such issues as black crime, and dangers of multi-culturalism.  What is going on here?  Are new alliances forming? </p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe things aren&rsquo;t a simple as the average student learned in school from his leftist professor.  Just like a number of white students in Paris recently learned that the best intentions don&rsquo;t spare them when they found themselves outnumbered in a sea of non-whites, so will the average student learn that race issues and racism will only accelerate as the white population dwindles.  Just like the liberal whites are the first ones to leave South Africa, having learned their lesson, so too will the likes of average student learn future lessons and most likely run.</p>
<p>Average student, if you are a non-white well done - you have learned well and I applaud you.  I know many non-whites who know how to play whites brilliantly.</p>
<p>If you are white, however, than you are foolish.  Race problems and racism are not going away any time soon our present demograpic course ensures that.  </p>

					<p>Mr.Taylor an excellent article. However do you have a solution to our racial problems ? Yes we know the house is on fire. We have known it since the late sixties. My proscription is we must deport <span class="caps">ALL </span>criminal blacks to their native central Africa.They could be classified as undesirable citizens. Decent black folk have nothing to fear and we would be free at last from the savage element prevalant among them. Banish these misfits once and for all! Banish them now !</p>

					<p>This is a very good piece, but I don&rsquo;t agree this is a Black White issue, but several issues rolled into one. </p>
<p>First of all; when you do not have morals, ethics or the supreme being, <span class="caps">GOD, </span>guiding your life then anything is possible; secondly, social issues such as: self-help, self-confidence, leadership, and initiative are all either eliminated or embraced by our society.</p>
<p>Our generous welfare state, as was pointed out, is the reason so many social issues are non-existant. I know first hand how our welfare system works. I was a displaced homemaker and asked for assistance to go back to college to be able to regain a spot in the workforce. I was told, &#8220;No, we can&rsquo;t help you, but we can offer you a rent-free apartment, utilities, healthcare, foodstamps and cash assistance.&#8221; I was even told in a slur, &#8220;We do not get people like you very often!&#8221; I bucked the system and paid dearly for doing it on my own.</p>
<p>People who grow up on the welfare system accepting that way of life pass it on to their children, who in turn pass it on to their children. The welfare system of &#8220;Being Taken Care Of&#8221; becomes society&rsquo;s <span class="caps">NORM.</span> Anyone growing up in the welfare system who does not know God can become as the people in <span class="caps">N.O.</span></p>
<p>There was a wake up call, and it was from <span class="caps">GOD</span>! Practicing witchcraft, palm reading, fortune telling, gambling ect are all despised by God, as was the idol worshippers that were wiped out by the tsumani.</p>
<p>I feel our country and the world are just starting to feel the pressures of judgement as many of the events happening are fore told in the Bible. Right becomes wrong and wrong becomes right.</p>
<p>On another note, I wonder why Jesse Jackson did not fly down to help <span class="caps">N.O.</span>?!!!But, I guess they did not need anymore <span class="caps">HOT </span>air!</p>

					<p>&#8220;Cassiodorus, if your believing that Blacks are stupid and violent makes you feel better about your own unproductive life, go for it, buddy! That&rsquo;s the only glory you will ever have.</p>
<p>1)It&rsquo;s not a belief. It&rsquo;s a fact. Crime statisitics, welfare statistics, psychometric testing, millennia of human history all point to the same conclusion. It is remarkable that people like you can be presented with the starkest images of American African savagery right on your television set (I mean, you don&rsquo;t have to get out of your seat or read something, or anything difficult like that) and still feel that We&rsquo;s All Equal. Such is the power of modern agitprop, combined with a congenital weakness of mind.</p>
<p>2)I wish to God one of you people would explain how you come to all this profound knowledge of our personal lives. I&rsquo;ve asked the question before: given such clairvoyance, why aren&rsquo;t you out making a killing on Wall Street? On the other hand, you might want to take your crystal ball into the shop. I don&rsquo;t really know what you mean by &#8220;unproductive,&#8221; but by conventional standards I think I&rsquo;m doing all right. I hold four university degrees, including a doctorate, I have been published in scholarly journals, and I make a perfectly respectable living in the business world. Of course, attacking the man and his motives rather than the argument is on the first page of the Liberal&rsquo;s Playbook, right, buddy?</p>

					<p>These drive-by posters are killing me.  Oh, I&rsquo;m supposed to read <span class="caps">TIME MAGAZINE </span>now?!  You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me&hellip;  You&rsquo;ve got the whole world indoctrinated, yet that&rsquo;s not enough - our little &#8220;snake pit of truth&#8221; is evidently torquing off a few people.</p>
<p>If we were not speaking of unpleasant <span class="caps">FACTS </span>here on this board, no one would bother us.  After all, no one really cares about a few kooks who believe the world is flat or that aliens are talking to them through their television set.  But a few unpleasant <span class="caps">FACTS </span>tend to get people all worked up, don&rsquo;t they?  Speak a little truth and you stir up a hornet&rsquo;s nest, right?  We&rsquo;re all just so worthless and insignificant so that&hellip; what, you need to come here and lecture us and label us as &#8220;illiterates?&#8221;  (By the way, I am currently working on a second master&rsquo;s degree - and it&rsquo;s not in Afro-Lesbian Sociology or some other joke discipline.)</p>
<p><br>
Last of all, yet again we see a reference to the Tulsa Race Riots.  As always, isolated historical examples of white mischief are used as an excuse to justify poor black behavior in general ad infinitum.  Well, first of all, Ronnie, those blacks were clearly not left to their own devices.  They lived in a <span class="caps">WHITE </span>society and their wealth was only created in the context of that society.  Second of all, for every Tulsa Race Riot trump card you have up your sleeve, we can list off dozens: the laundry list of &#8220;normal&#8221; black-on-white crime every year is more than enough to compensate for this incident.  Yet again, you are not addressing the issue at hand: <span class="caps">POOR BLACK BEHAVIOR.  </span></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?  Whites changed their attitudes.  The vast majority of whites (and yes, we are still the minority here on this board) thought that things could change for the better - because white people are actually moved by notions of &#8220;honesty&#8221; and &#8220;integrity.&#8221;  It was <span class="caps">WHITE </span>people who voted <span class="caps">THEMSELVES </span>out of power in South Africa and <span class="caps">WHITE </span>people who allowed the segregationist system in the South to be overturned.  Please don&rsquo;t fool yourself - you know this is the case.</p>
<p>Yet the favor has not been returned.  You talk about the Tulsa Race Riots, yet all you&rsquo;d have to do is switch &#8220;white South African&#8221; for &#8220;black South African&#8221; in your little tirade and you&rsquo;d find that the <span class="caps">REAL </span>genocide is being perpetuated by blacks against whites <span class="caps">TODAY.  </span></p>

					<p><b><i>&#8220;Of course, June Gordon is 100% right. The wonderful thing is that, as we speak, Americans of all stripes have contributed millions toward helping the victims. They know, as anyone with even a modicum of sense knows, that the looters comprised a minority of those who remained in New Orleans. Of course, the people here at AR like to delude themselves into thinking that &#8220;white America&#8221; is finally &#8220;waking up&#8221; and will want to have nothing to do with blacks. Of course, Jared Taylor and Co. have been repeating this mantra for years, and it has never happened. And never will.

<p>Let&rsquo;s not be too harsh on &#8220;AverageStudent&#8221;. </p>
<p>To youth goes the ignorance and lack of wisdom garnered from a short life of little experience. What this &#8220;AverageStudent&#8221; student fails to recognize is that most of us were liberal in our youth, with &#8220;We are the world, we are the children&#8221; ideals. Because we had no experience. But then we grew up. And we woke up. The many true realities in life have a way of doing that to you.</p>
<p>Having not long from the protection and comfort of their mother&rsquo;s arms, that shielded them from the harsh realities we older folks had/have to face, they desperately seek the safety promised them in the Liberal Delusions of Multiculturalism and Diversity.<br>
 <br><br>
So for now these &#8220;AverageStudents&#8221; have to depend on what their liberal teachers and liberal media tell them. Pity them. Eventually as they grow older(and if they don&rsquo;t live a sheltered life in Liberal &#8216;LaLa Land&rsquo; communities segregated from the realities of Black urban culture), life will eventually hit them upside the head with a 2by4, and they will realize just how incredibly stupid they were when they were young.</p>
<p>As Mark Twain said, &#8220;When I was fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have him around. When I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much he had learned in seven years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as the old saying goes, &#8220;If you&rsquo;re not a liberal when you&rsquo;re 25, you have no heart. If you&rsquo;re not a conservative by the time you&rsquo;re 35, you have no brain.&#8221; </p>

					<p>Livin, maybe my views are shaped the way they are because I work at an upscale private school and work with Black kids whose parents are fairly well off.  It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine these youngsters looting and righting mainly because of their upbringing and surroundings. There are some real &#8220;Cosby&#8221; kids.  I don&rsquo;t believe that violent Black behavior is somehow &#8220;innate&#8221;.  I guess it&rsquo;s the classic argument of &#8220;nature&#8221; vs. &#8220;nuture&#8221;.  Would these looters, rapist and killers in New Orleans behave the same way if raised in a different household and in a different area than the Notorius 9th Ward?  Most people on the AmRen site would probably say yes, but I say no.</p>
<p>Mr. Pendleton, you write that: &#8220;Christian race-liberals (including the idiots in the Christian so-called &#8220;Right&#8221;) should be ashamed of themselves. May you rot in Hell - or at least Purgatory - for a very long time!&#8221;<br>
My church teaches that <span class="caps">GOD </span>does not want <span class="caps">ANYONE </span>to go to Hell&hellip;that&rsquo;s why he gave his only begotten son (John 3:16).  For a &#8220;Christian&#8221; to wish someone to rot is Hell over a difference in political beliefs or doctrine is not in keeping with the Jesus Christ I know. What you should be doing is spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ so America will not become like Europe, where White people have abandoned the Church. As a result, Islam is coming on strong there.  Once the White man lets go of Christ, he loses it all!  And where is Christianity spreading the fastest? Africa and China!  And <span class="caps">GOD </span>will bless those who bless Him.  If America, especially White America, is to remain prominent in the World, they better <span class="caps">NEVER </span>abandon the fundementals of the Christian faith as you apparently have.</p>
<p>Cassiodurus, I congratulate you for you educational and scholarly attainments, but guess what?  There are Black scholars who have done what have you done and more. And if they&rsquo;re &#8220;Stupid and violent&#8221;, what are  you on the evolutionary scale?  And even more importantly, what good does it a man to gain the whole world and lose your soul?  You use your considerable gifts to denigrate a whole race of people? Your life is unproductive because you bear <span class="caps">BAD </span>fruit if you are using your talents and education to forment the seeds of hatred and strife.  People complain about &#8220;Africa and Africans&#8221;, but then act like they want to see the same horror of &#8220;tribal&#8221; conflict that has affected that continent. I guess they want us to be a big Bosnia, a burned out shell of a country as a result of seething ethnic and racial hatreds. <span class="caps">THIS</span> IS <span class="caps">AMERICA. </span> It&rsquo;s a young country and is still in many ways an experiment.  I&rsquo;d hate to see it fall into the flames of racial hatred, no matter whether it&rsquo;s coming from Blacks or Whites.</p>

					<p>You can argue ad infinitum about good and bad individuals, but when it comes down to it, look at shopping malls. When I moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, 20 years ago, Wheaton Shopping Center was very nice, no problems; same with the Prince Georges shopping center. Increasing numbers of blacks have made them off-limits for non-blacks. Same with Silver Spring. They are trying to coax more whites back by opening the American Film Institute there, and that is helping, but for a while, Silver Spring was a lost cause. I am really sorry, but once these shopping centers become majority (or even large minority) black, nobody else wants to go to them. Murders, assaults and theft occur on a regular basis. Yes, we all know whites commit crime too, but we all have the similar stories of a far safer childhood when crime and harrasment was really horror news and not banal. Same with the neighborhoods. A hispanic couple of my acquaintance live in <span class="caps">P.G. </span>county in a beautiful hoouse, and finally admitted they have to move because it is too black  &mdash;  they can&rsquo;t take the kids. It&rsquo;s embarrassing for them because one of their sons is married to a black lady. These are in more or less middle class areas, with the same schools and libraries used by the whites. Liberals keep calling people on this board &#8220;racists&#8221; and similar things, and yet they cannot say why we are wrong. They just call us emotional names, as if we are making all this up. I wonder where on earth they live, that they can be so  &mdash;  obtuse. <br>
  Yes, there are very nice black people; I know black individuals who are brilliant, wonderful, a credit to the human race, and whom I&rsquo;d prefer to most whites. As for stupidity, this federal administration is an advertisement for stupidity. So I can be objective. <br><br>
   Yet, let an area become more than 20% much less 70% black, and who wants to be there? What white person could there? There must be some exceptions but I&rsquo;ve seen blacks move into neighborhoods in Baltimore, and the <span class="caps">D.C. </span>area, and they inevitably decline and become places where no white wants to be.  I have been mugged, harrassed, victimized by blacks, yet I myself have never done anything to them. At some point, I realized this &#8220;racism&#8221; stuff and &#8220;white guilt&#8221; is a scam. I have suffered from blacks and not the other way around. They have destroyed my property, nearly my life.<br><br>
    Except for the French Quarter, <span class="caps">N.O. </span>was on its way to becoming another Detroit. <br><br>

					<p>You trace the moral degeneracy among the inhabitants of New Orleans to race.  I trace it to a disease that I call government dependency.  People who depend on government to provide their wants and needs are. or soon become, immoral.  Taxation is theft, and the one and only distinction between taxation and extortion is that the enforcers of taxation are government agents.  Sending agents to do one&rsquo;s dirty work does not absolve  government dependents of their moral terpitude.  Government dependency and the resultant decay in morality explains everything bad that took place in New Orleans  &mdash;  including the hurricane if you believe in Divine retribution.  White Americans salve their collective conscience for their degenerate treatment of black as slaves and Indians as bothersome land claimants by enabling both groups to become government dependents  &mdash;  and degenerate.  Thus, white Americans continue to reap the whirlwind of their own immorality and are equally responsible with blacks for the degenerate state of America.  </p>

					<p>Revelation, you said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Last of all, yet again we see a reference to the Tulsa Race Riots. As always, isolated historical examples of white mischief are used as an excuse to justify poor black behavior in general ad infinitum. Well, first of all, Ronnie, those blacks were clearly not left to their own devices. They lived in a <span class="caps">WHITE </span>society and their wealth was only created in the context of that society. Second of all, for every Tulsa Race Riot trump card you have up your sleeve, we can list off dozens: the laundry list of &#8220;normal&#8221; black-on-white crime every year is more than enough to compensate for this incident. Yet again, you are not addressing the issue at hand: <span class="caps">POOR BLACK BEHAVIOR.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>Dude, you missed my points entirely and maybe it&rsquo;s my fault for not articulating them better. I&rsquo;m not excusing <span class="caps">POOR BLACK BEHAVIOR&hellip;I </span>fall right in line with Bill Cosby&rsquo;s recent statements to that effect. But here are my main points:</p>
<p>1.)Because of Jim Crow and Segregation, there were numerous all-Black townships that were self-sustaining, especially in the South.  Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s statement that &#8220;Blacks can&rsquo;t accomplish anything when left to their own devices&#8221; ignores the whole Post-reconstruction era through the 1930&rsquo;s, when Black people <span class="caps">HAD </span>to take care of themselves&hellip;.there was no welfare, no jobs with big corporations, no affirmative action, etc.  And in many of these small Black townships and the segregated areas of larger cities, there was a degree of prosperity and civil behavior because Black people had to relay on each other for goods and services, not the White man. Black consumers <span class="caps">HAD </span>to use Black doctors, nurses, midwives, Blacksmiths, retail stores, builders, insurance companies etc.   <span class="caps">INTEGRATION </span>is the main factor that destroyed greater Black prosperity in this country, not White racism. If it were not for Integration, I can almost guarantee that Black communities in American would be much more prosperous than they are now. <span class="caps">INTEGRATION </span>has been the biggest hinderance to Black wealth in America, because in 2005, 98% of Black dollars are spent with businesses outside of the so-called &#8220;Black community&#8221;&hellip;..</p>
<p>2.) &hellip;&hellip;And Corporate America IS <span class="caps">NOT </span>about to part with that 98% anytime soon&hellip;.not with their being $700 <span class="caps">BILLION </span>in Black Consumer spending power. It was capitalism and greed that led to the destruction of many of these prosperous Black townships and areas, and White racism was just the tool used by the Business elite to bring about their destruction.  Look at Tulsa. Anytime you have a group of Black people spending money to the point where they create 10 Black Millionaires in one segregated area in 1921, that means there is some serious cash being floated around.  And business is about competition&hellip;.as just as HP wants the cash that Dell customers spend, the White business elite wanted that cash that these Blacks had to spend (don&rsquo;t think for a second that HP wouldn&rsquo;t burn Dell down if they could get away with it!)   And consequently, the Tulsa Business elite fanned the flames of racism among lower-class Whites and got them to do their dirty deeds.  And &#8220;Black Wall Street&#8221; ended up getting torn to shreds, not necessarily because of White racism, but because of capitalism run amuck. Racism was just the tool used to get the job done.</p>

<p>&#8220;This makes me ashamed to have the same skin color as Blacks. I wish I was white.&#8221; </p>
<p>You can &#8220;wish&#8221; all you want, but that ain&rsquo;t happening.  You need to worry less about the color of your skin and worry more about how thin it is.  Man-up, dude!  You&rsquo;re a sick guy.  <span class="caps">NEVER </span>be ashamed of who you are. Please go get some therapy, dude&hellip;you&rsquo;re acting like a total wuss.</p>
<p>And &#8220;IndianGuy&#8221;, you&rsquo;re just as bad. I&rsquo;m sure you think you&rsquo;re accepted now because you&rsquo;ve made your predictable anti-Black rant and think White people will love you now because of your butt-kissing.  Feel better now? You can now be an &#8220;honorary White&#8221; for a day along with your friend Raj Patel.  If I were you, I&rsquo;d concentrate less about what Black people do and be more about your nuclear-armed Pakistani Muslim friends next door to your home country.  </p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that there are still people who think the way that Jared Taylor thinks. All of you are cowards. I feel sorry for you. You have nothing better to do than hate. Do you honestly hate or dislike non-whites, or is it that you&rsquo;re so unhappy with yourselves that you turn your self-hatred and distain outward towards others. All of your comments were made out of ignorance and cruelty. You can keep crying and whining about how you hate Blacks and it&rsquo;s not going to do you the least bit of good. Blacks are here to stay and you have to deal with it. So if it makes you feel better about your pointless, meaningless lives, than just go ahead and write your little notes like sissy school girls on the school playground, because the moral of this story is Africa is in your mist and the Blacks are coming to a neighborhood near you. And I bet that none of you will have the balls to say none of what your comments say in the face of your most feared enemy. I bet you all will tuck your tails underneath you, muster a fake smile and say welcome to the neighborhood. Just a thought.</p>

					<p>Dear &#8220;appalled&#8221; Jewish nanny,<br>
 <br><br>
Nannies can - and must - make apologies for the peccadillos of the urchins entrusted to them by idealistic parents.  <br><br>
 <br><br>
In the adult world, however, if you want to &#8220;nanny&#8221; the New Orleans human debris that disgraced our shores by taking issue with Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s article, you must refute him with hard facts, and not a careful selection of facts that support your prearragned conclusion.  Then you must produce a credible conclusion in light of those facts.  </p>
<p>Otherwise you will underwhelm your adult readers,as you did me. <br>
 <br><br>
My advice, Jewish nanny, fwiw, is, stick with tending children. By &#8220;nannying&#8221; blacks in the adult world, making excuses for their dispicable behavior, you expect a deplorably lower standard of behavior from what you expect of yourself.  And why is this?  Do you perceive some intrinsic moral inferiority on their part?  Doesn&rsquo;t that make you far more racist than any &#8220;racist&#8221; you may imagine yourself to have met?<br><br>
 <br><br>

					<p>To Comrade QJoe,</p>
<p>You protest both too much and too late!</p>
<p>You decided to come on this site and vulgarly attack a number of the posters here, in a tirade of tolerance?</p>
<p>Now the have defended themselves and you attempt to play the shame and defame game? </p>
<p>First observation: &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s the classic argument of &#8220;nature&#8221; vs. &#8220;nuture&#8221;. Would these looters, rapist and killers in New Orleans behave the same way if raised in a different household and in a different area than the Notorius 9th Ward? Most people on the AmRen site would probably say yes, but I say no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The argument of nature and nurture is a complicated one, to say the very least. However, it is generally accepted today in the behavioral and to a lesser extent the social(ist) sciences that this is 50/50 prospect. Environment and genetics play a interactive role in the reactions and behaviors of an individual. Is it that far of a stretch to consider that the same might hold true for groups of people? </p>
<p>You note for example, &ldquo;I work at an upscale private school and work with Black kids whose parents are fairly well off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This of course provokes some very serious questions. What is the percentage of &ldquo;Black kids&rdquo; with socially advantaged parents in your school? Is it 1%, 10%, 50%, 75%, or 100%? How did the parents of these black children become &ldquo;fairly well off&rdquo; and not be ravaged in the &ldquo;racism&rdquo; that is &ldquo;endemic&rdquo; in American society? How did they escape the &ldquo;Notorius 9th Wards&rdquo; of this country, established to oppress their kind? Was it because of Affirmative Action or their own natural abilities, or a combination of the two? If so, how is it that a &ldquo;racist&rdquo; society would establish Affirmative Action to advantage some blacks, when its goal is to universally oppress them? If all people are inherently similar and nurture is the only key to this question, why are not so many other blacks unable to utilize the advantages of Affirmative Action, as have your &ldquo;fairly well off&rdquo; black &ldquo;Cosby kids&rdquo; and their parents?</p>
<p>Second observation: &ldquo;And <span class="caps">GOD </span>will bless those who bless Him. If America, especially White America, is to remain prominent in the World, they better <span class="caps">NEVER </span>abandon the fundementals of the Christian faith as you apparently have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And God will also help those who help and defend themselves. To accept Marxism in any form, is to reject God and his will. Multiculturalism is and always has been a form of Marxism. If you accept that whites must remake themselves into a &ldquo;new&rdquo; form of man by allowing their cultures and civilizations (to say nothing of their gene pools) to be overrun and &ldquo;enriched&rdquo; by alien nonwhite invaders, you abandon the gifts and cornerstones God bestowed upon us as a people. Here your point regarding Islam is very pertinent, as a racially conscious white Judeo-Christian society, would not allow such a foreign and incompatible &ldquo;religion&rdquo; not only to be spread, but also to be idealized as an equal or even worse a protected and preferred &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; to their social fabric. This multiculturalism clearly does, when it demands for example, the teaching or acceptance of Islamic &ldquo;law&rdquo; in our lands to accommodate Muslim &ldquo;immigrants,&rdquo; but also moves to rename Christmas as Winterfest and Easter as Bunny Basket Day or some other stupidly euphemized secular &ldquo;celebration,&rdquo; in every possible public institution. </p>
<p>Third and last observation: &ldquo;And even more importantly, what good does it a man to gain the whole world and lose your soul? You use your considerable gifts to denigrate a whole race of people? Your life is unproductive because you bear <span class="caps">BAD </span>fruit if you are using your talents and education to forment the seeds of hatred and strife. People complain about &lsquo;Africa and Africans&rsquo;, but then act like they want to see the same horror of &lsquo;tribal&rsquo; conflict that has affected that continent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very, very, wrong Comrade, it is not I, Livin, Mr. Pendleton, or Cassiodurus, who have done this; it is you, who attempt to gain the world and thus has lost his soul! Your loss of racial identity and embracing of multiculturalism, twists your gifts to evil&rsquo;s ends and not only to &ldquo;denigrate&rdquo; but also to seek the genocide of &ldquo; a whole race of people&rdquo; and everything they stand for and have built. In this vein, you might consider how wrong it is to nurture that which is unnatural to one&rsquo;s self and survival. </p>
<p>Reread my first point and consider it sincerely in conjunction with my second and third; after you have done this reconsider just how your fanciful multicultural views &ldquo;about &lsquo;Africa and Africans,&rsquo;&rdquo; might just be germinating &ldquo;the same horror of &lsquo;tribal&rsquo; conflict that has affected that continent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just something to think about!<br>
  <br><br>
  <br><br>

					<p>Unbelievable, breathtaking article.  I have printed this article out and plan to save.  What kind of people leave a corpse in chair to rot?  This country needs to open it&rsquo;s eyes and realize what this country is becoming.  We are supposedly going to become the minority in 2050.  What will happen when these beasts are through out the country?  Something needs to change and quick.  Our lives and our childrens lives are at stake!</p>

					<p>Hey Cujoe; (woof woof, slobber, slobber)</p>
<p>Your statement;<br>
&#8220;So to all of those Black military guys (and even a few gals) whose pictures I saw in last Sunday&rsquo;s paper listed as fatalities in Iraq and Afghanistan, I say to you, thank you for giving your life so Cassiodorus has the freedom to write in air-conditioned comfort about how &#8220;stupid and violent&#8221; you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>indicates to me that you have <span class="caps">NEVER </span>served in the military with blacks. If you had, you would <span class="caps">NEVER </span>make such a ridiculous statement.</p>
<p>I served four years in the military with lots of blacks, and like  any normal distribution, there were a few decent(six sigma out) blacks alongside the vast majority of dumber-than-rocks, violent, jail or the military blacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget the racial composition of my basic training flight, 58 blacks from East St. Louis and two white boys, one of which was me.</p>
<p>One night, one of the E. St. Lou bruthas got a letter from his girlfriend back home. Very soon, 30 other bruthas were whooping and dancing and shouting around his bed as the letter was inpregnated with hits of <span class="caps">LSD.</span></p>
<p>I got to watch the pre-cursor to New Orleans that night, as the letter was torn into little pieces for each brutha to get a hit of acid. These freaks were bad enough straight, <span class="caps">LSD </span>sent them right back to Zululand.</p>
<p>Eventually, the security police waded into the mess with night sticks and rifles, restoring order (just like New Orleans!)</p>
<p>I could write a <span class="caps">BOOK </span>about the four years of insanity I observed from blacks in the military!</p>

Would these looters, rapist and killers in New Orleans behave the same way if raised in a different household and in a different area than the Notorius 9th Ward? Most people on the AmRen site would probably say yes, but I say no.&#8221;</p>
<p>You say &#8220;no,&#8221; because you can&rsquo;t comprehend the full picture.</p>
<p>If you regularly read this web site, the idiotic ideas you have badly expressed and the questions you raise based on them, would be answered for you.</p>
<p>For example, take intelligence. Oodles of tests have been administered to the offspring of high income blacks and they don&rsquo;t perform as well as low income whites.  Every race on earth scores higher than blacks, as a group, whether its academic tests or <span class="caps">I.Q. </span>tests.  That&rsquo;s no secret.  That info can be found anywhere.</p>
<p>And, every race on earth holds abject contempt for blacks, not just whites. If blacks are disliked by anybody on this site and elsewhere it has nothing to do with feeling superior or hating someone that is different, as the ridiculous <span class="caps">P.C. </span>crowd would have eveyone  believe.  It&rsquo;s because their behavior is violent and criminal in a large percentage of them, and it&rsquo;s that way all over the world, not just here, and it&rsquo;s big part of the reason this country is imploding.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you know that white flight to the suburbs all over the country is unequivocal proof that whites don&rsquo;t like blacks?  You won&rsquo;t hear them say publicly what you read on this site, but make no mistake about it the <span class="caps">MAJORITY </span>hold great contempt for blacks and believe they are bad for our country.  Like all left wing radicals you actually believe your thinking is the majority.  How utterly naive.  Are all these people &#8220;Haters?&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t think so, but they know most blacks are, which is strangely unbeknown to people like you.</p>
<p>A few years ago a Japanese high profile figure said that America would not be able to compete in the future global scene, because they have too many blacks.  Ask them what they think of blacks, their behavior and their intelligence.  If you told any Asian countries they should import blacks to create diversity they would unhesitatingly laugh in your face, because they&rsquo;re much brighter than the <span class="caps">P.C. </span>ideologues here in this country, and know very well that such a stupid move would be asking for higher crime and violence and a dependent population of loud, unruly blacks.</p>
<p>And, every Western culture blacks have immigrated to, where they receive handsome benefit packages and much more, indicates the same high crime rate, the same lack of ability and the same low intelligence and horrendous attitudes we see right here in this country. </p>
<p> Look at Africa.  In all their history they never even invented the wheel nor a writtn language, and they&rsquo;re still living in a near stone-age existence.  The cities Europeans built and were given to them to stop their whining are all crumbling and degenerating into abysmal condition.  Because they are purging whites from their countries they are beginning to starve, because they can&rsquo;t feed themselves.  Anti-white racism is rampant and many white farmers have had their land taken from them, and many innocent whites, including women and children have been murdered.  Run a search on it.</p>
<p>Your first post sounds as if it came from one of your students in that your great defense of blacks was to say: &#8220;Cassiodorus, if your believing that Blacks are stupid and violent makes you feel better about your own unproductive life, go for it, buddy! That&rsquo;s the only glory you will ever have.&#8221;</p>
<p>How utterly stupid and childish to think someone hates somebody, because it somehow elevates him/her.    Blacks are stupid and violent because hard facts and figures show what he says to be unquestionably true.  And why have you assumed he has an unproductive life?  I doubt you know anything about him.  Also, I can&rsquo;t speak for Cassiodorus, but I can tell you for certain that he doesn&rsquo;t quote facts and figures you seem to find offensive, because he believes there is some kind of glory to be obtained.  I agree with everything he said because they are <span class="caps">PROVEN FACTS, </span>not because I&rsquo;m looking for glory or I&rsquo;m a failure.  I&rsquo;ve had nine different businesses that have been roaring successes.  Such assertions are ridiculous coming from someone who is in one of the lesser paying professions. How idiotic and naive.</p>
<p>And also how idiotic and naive if you don&rsquo;t know that black anti-white racism and hatred against whites are why the majority of whites want nothing to do with blacks.  Really pitiful.  Read the color of crime.  Download it from this site.  Don&rsquo;t be so bigotted. </p>
<p>You also childisly ask: &#8220;Is the National Guard General Russell Honore, who is Black, behaving in a way that is &#8220;innate&#8221; to Black people?&#8221;</p>
<p>Who knows how this Honore is behaving and what difference  does it make anyhow?  We all know minorities are awarded promotion on the basis of race rather than ability, so all you really prove is that there&rsquo;s an affirmative action in place in the military.  We will see great problems in the near future because of our <span class="caps">P.C. </span>military.  We have had an example of it at  Abu Ghraib.  More will follow, and it will be much worse.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your point here.  You seem so eager to give one incident in rebuttal to thousands of incidences as if giving just one example invalidates opposing opinion, even though such opposing opinion is rife with myriad examples of black violence, lack of intelligence, and complete inability via government sites referenced here.  </p>
<p>And you seem to be laboring under the delusion that the whites who dislike blacks have no reason for it other than it glorifies them and appeases their failures, and you indicate further delusion by not recognizing that black, anti-white racism is not only real and in play constantly, but it is making a dangerous climate for our friends and families.</p>
<p>And, finally, oh, yes,&hellip;&hellip;.WE <span class="caps">ARE </span>heading for Civil WarII, and it is because of the rabid actions and attitudes of minority tribesmen who don&rsquo;t want equality, but want power and dominance, but only for their tribal members.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe there are people as naive and uninformed as you are, and it is really a pity.<br>

<p>Response:  Yes, and it&rsquo;s just a thought from someone who is too cowardly to giver her/his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a shame that there are still people who think the way that Jared Taylor thinks. All of you are cowards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Response: Oh, really?  Then why don&rsquo;t you email me direct and I would be glad to support our position with factual information, unless you aren&rsquo;t bright enough to understand it?   Or, too cowardly to write.</p>
<p>How easily brainwashed <span class="caps">P.C. </span>radicals, who are gutless to the nth degree always resort to claiming people who don&rsquo;t agree with them are cowards.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you move to an all black area if you love diversity so much and hate your own people with such passion?  </p>
<p>We are the majority, you know.  The vocal majority.  Others can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t say anything in public, but, believe me, they&rsquo;re cheering us on.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know that, you are a bigger fool than you have already proven to be.</p>

<p>Spare us your pitty. We stand up for our people, our countries, our rights.  Why is that so cowardly?  We just don&rsquo;t believe in the fairytales of multicultural bliss.  We believe they are lies that are meant to weaken our role in the world.  Simply, we are trying to ensure our long term survival.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Do you honestly hate or dislike non-whites, or is it that you&rsquo;re so unhappy with yourselves that you turn your self-hatred and distain outward towards others.&#8221;<br>
Wow&hellip; so deep.  It that what they teach in psych 101 today, or did you hear it on Operah?  I would say the latter is more likely and that you are either in grade 8 or early high school - right?</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks are here to stay and you have to deal with it.&#8221;<br>
Says who?  You??? And who are you exactly to have such god-like decision making powers?  Are you even white, or are you some non-white agitator?</p>
<p>&#8220;moral of this story is Africa is in your mist and the Blacks are coming to a neighborhood near you.&#8221;<br>
Once again, says who?  Every poll shows that vast majority of whites want to remain a majority and live with their own kind.  And why wouldn&rsquo;t they?  It makes sense!  Why become a minority willingly?  See the issue here Freud?  You are telling us what to do because you think that you are so morally superior to us. More and more whites are rejecting what your message represents - their own demise and death.  And why wouldn&rsquo;t they???</p>

Wrong! You are used to dealing with liberal whites who take in a few token blacks into their neighbourhood and play that stupid game of fake smiles, fake praises, fake interaction, etc.  We are not those types of whites.  I for one treat blacks with more respect than that.  I consider their group competitors, but I can hold civil (non-fake) conversations with them.  And I don&rsquo;t feel like a coward doing it.  But if things ever go bad - a la New Orlean floods - I am not shocked and I am ready. That&rsquo;s more than I can say for &#8216;liberal&rsquo; whites.  That is why all the liberal whites are running out of South Africa first, but the tougher, more realistic whites are sticking around a little longer.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Just a thought.&#8221;<br>
You don&rsquo;t have thoughts.  You just regurgitate what you hear on &#8216;liberal&rsquo; (i.e. anti-white) television shows, from your leftist teachers, etc. and throw it at us as if it&rsquo;s some kind news to us.  Let me tell you something. What you said is boring.  It&rsquo;s not even original in any sort of way.  I have talked to many anti-white people and many, <span class="caps">MANY </span>of them had way more perceptive things to say than you.  What you said is totally cliche and predictable.  If you want to destroy us, at least think of more original things to say, don&rsquo;t bore us.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Cassiodurus, I congratulate you for you educational and scholarly attainments, but guess what? There are Black scholars who have done what have you done and more. And if they&rsquo;re &#8220;Stupid and violent&#8221;, what are you on the evolutionary scale?&#8221;</p>
<p>Where to begin? Do you have a basic understanding of statistics? There is a standard deviation gap in IQ (perhaps a bit more than a full <span class="caps">SDV</span>) between blacks and whites. This means that slightly less than one black in six has even an average white <span class="caps">IQ.</span> The tiny number of black scholars does not alter this in the slightest, especially given the &#8220;soft&#8221; fields in which they work (half of all black doctorates are awarded in Education, which, not to put too fine a point upon it, is rather a joke). While some scholars still think there&rsquo;s a significant &#8220;cultural&#8221; element to this gap, no one disputes its existence.</p>
<p>Nor are all blacks violent, but again the disparity is so great as to be undeniable. Department of Justice stats prove, for instance, that a black is seven times more likely to commit murder than a white. If a black murder rate seven times higher than that of whites does not qualify as &#8220;violent,&#8221; the term has no meaning.</p>
<p>As for the &#8220;evolutionary scale,&#8221; no one but you has invoked this foggy notion.</p>
<p>&#8220;And even more importantly, what good does it a man to gain the whole world and lose your soul?&#8221;</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve established your credentials as dispenser and saver of souls, perhaps we can talk. As it stands your standing is this matter is no more convincing that your claim to know whether my life is &#8220;productive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You use your considerable gifts to denigrate a whole race of people?&#8221;</p>
<p>I use them to form what I believe are viable conclusions about the way the world actually is. If that is not a legitimate use of intelligence and learning, what is? Serious intellectual inquiry does not always lead where someone&rsquo;s mystical theology would like it to go. It would be nice to discover that every person on earth is intelligent and peaceful. That conclusion would not square with facts or logic. In any case, no person, black, white or green, who treats me with basic decency has anything to fear from me. I believe in the golden rule.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your life is unproductive because you bear <span class="caps">BAD </span>fruit if you are using your talents and education to forment the seeds of hatred and strife.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have got to be kidding. Take a serious look at crime stats and tell me who&rsquo;s fomenting (not &#8220;formenting&#8221;) hatred. This absurd claim grows more tiresome every day: blacks commit anti-white crimes (look at &#8220;The Color of Crime&#8221; on this site for the official government number) at a staggering rate. Yet it is not these crimes that concern enlightened folk like you. You&rsquo;re upset that someone is observing black criminality and talking about it openly. </p>
<p>&#8220;People complain about &#8220;Africa and Africans&#8221;, but then act like they want to see the same horror of &#8220;tribal&#8221; conflict that has affected that continent.&#8221;</p>
<p>So you admit that Africa is beset with violence. That&rsquo;s a good start. But your inference is wrong. African violence and mayhem are depressing spectacles. Surely you would agree that it is more desirable for a nation to be less like Africa than more like it, no?</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they want us to be a big Bosnia, a burned out shell of a country as a result of seething ethnic and racial hatreds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not at all. We&rsquo;d like to stop the policies and laws, especially our immigration policies, that are making balkanization more likely by the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;THIS IS <span class="caps">AMERICA.</span> It&rsquo;s a young country and is still in many ways an experiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half right. America is a particular nation, a creation of a particular race of people at a particular historic moment. Until the mid-60s, immigration policy was explicitly designed to maintain a European racial population. No one who talks about America as an &#8220;experiment&#8221; has any regard for the actual, historic nation at all. They prefer the aracial, anti-white fantasies of the multiculturalists. Perhaps one of them will some day explain in some sort of detail exactly why the America of 1965 (when Teddy the K gutted sane immigration law) was such an awful place. Unless we change course, African-style and balkan-style violence will become the norm, and not the occasional exception (like Katrina). </p>

					<p>Cassiodorus, I enjoy your insightful posts every time out - however, Teddy K was merely the sponsor of the Immigration Act of &#8216;65.  Read Kevin MacDonald among others to discover the whole story behind that traitorous legislation.  It would be interesting to find out what was said behind closed doors to make sure Ted took his thirty pieces of silver.  Maybe a promise of the same treatment his older brother received?</p>

					<p>I knew that if anybody could bring sense and sensibility to the chaos and thuggery in Louisiana.  Mr. Taylor could.  Those who viewed his essay as racist are way out of touch or just so blind they refuse to see what is in front of them.  And of course, there are those who will jlook for excuses for any type of bad behavior.  That&rsquo;s why our country is rotting from within because the powers who could have put a stop to this behavior years and years ago, have failed to do their job.  </p>
<p>If I wanted to live in a third world cesspool, I&rsquo;d move to Africa. </p>
<p>Thank you Mr. Taylor for once again bringing some intelligence to this horrible, horrible situation.</p>

<p>With a heavy heart, I sadly must say given the state of our educational system, that I actually believe you are indeed an Attorney. </p>
<p>Where to begin, where to begin, when one of America&rsquo;s &#8216;best and brightest&rsquo; comes up with a platitude of astronomical proportions.</p>
<p>Actually Catherine, the worst gang were the Communists (they had Latinos, Asians, Africans &amp; Caucasians - all racially separate gangs though, they never believed in diversity either). They were even involved in the great eastern European turf war of 1941 – 1945, against the contemptible socialist gang, &lsquo;the Nazi&rsquo;s&rsquo; you mention. I bet they had drive bys on street corners and everything. PS the &#8216;bloods&rsquo; won.</p>
<p>Even with all the tough competition, this must be the winner of the most utterly idiotic comment from a liberal of the year (especially when this person must be somewhat sane, educated and with at least a nominal IQ).</p>
<p>Vote 1 Catherine. </p>
<p><span class="caps">PS. </span>&#8216;Focus on the issue: how can we deal with gangs.&rsquo; - having no black and latino youth in your neighbourhood is always an extremely effective solution.<br>

I seriously wonder the Normal distribution is the correct model of human intelligence. I have known a full blooded black so intelligent that he would have been 6 standard deviations away from the black mean, if not more. (I am not disputing the results a la Rushton etc.)</p>

Posted by Catherine G. Ratliff, Attorney at 7:20 PM on September 9&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s got to be <span class="caps">THE </span>dumbest assessment of all the ones posted on this article.</p>
<p>Too, it&rsquo;s curious that you&rsquo;re the only one I&rsquo;ve ever seen on this forum who has elected to post your occupation, apparently believing that it gives you some elitist status for some reason, or, perhaps, you think people will be too intimidated to rebut your nonsense. Either reason is highly likely given your example of asinine logic, or, better yet, a complete lack of it.</p>
<p>One of the main assertions the mainstream media attempts to flim flam the public with, whenever there is anti-white violent racism by blacks against whites, is to dismiss the incident as strictly &#8220;gang related,&#8221; implying that the blacks responsible are aside and apart from the average black, when the truth of the matter is that hardly any black on white attacks are gang related and, instead, are the result of black racism from throughout the black population against whites.  The bottom line is that the problem isn&rsquo;t gangs it&rsquo;s black racism against whites that is rife within the black community over the entire country.</p>
<p>It is people like you who can&rsquo;t think for themselves who  buy this gang related nonsense from the mainstream media, and many authorities, because they believe it is their job to tell us how to think, because if the truth were told, it could create white violence against blacks in retaliation. So, you see, it is because they feel they know better than anyone else, and it is they who should decide what we should know and not know.  And, of course, it works with people like you, who can&rsquo;t think objectively or independently.</p>
<p>Blacks believe that whites are responsible for all their failings, including their lack of ability to achieve, their high crime rate, and even their lack of intelligence is dismissed as systemic white racism.  </p>
<p>It is necessary to hold these views for a people who never invented the wheel nor a written language, who have spent thousands of years locked into a stone-age life style, and who  fail in every way to better themselves as a group, to lay the blame for their lack of intelligence and ability on someone or the alternative is to admit they just don&rsquo;t belong among civilized people.  And that blame in every existence is placed on white people.  It never ends and it never will, until we finish up with the Civil War II phase of this continuing low intensity conflict that threatens to explode at the drop of a hat every single day of the year.</p>
<p>Black males are just 6% of the US population but commit 56% of all violent crime, per <span class="caps">FBI </span>statistics.  If any of this can be tied to gangs, then the entire black population has to be considered a gang, if one were to use your line of logic, or your lack of ability to logic in coherent terms.</p>
<p>Do you live in a cave?  Don&rsquo;t you know that it isn&rsquo;t just whites that dislike unruly, loud, criminal black behavior and low intelligence?  Every race on earth feels the same way, with many of them rabidly anti-black.  So you see, this situation here isn&rsquo;t a black on white thing, it&rsquo;s a black on everybody thing.  Don&rsquo;t you know that there are numerous and increasing incidences of black/Hispanic racial violence all over this country the mainstream media isn&rsquo;t picking up on on a national level?  If you think these are gangs, I know for certain you live in a cave, out of touch with the real world.</p>
<p>And, finally, Nazism isn&rsquo;t a gang, it&rsquo;s an ideology, just like the one you have that&rsquo;s called Cultural Marxism, with which you have been gullibly indoctrinated with but aren&rsquo;t smart enough to know you&rsquo;ve been duped like a fool.  Gangs are mobs that DO sometimes have an organizational basis, but do not advocate any kind of ideology, because they aren&rsquo;t bright enough to adapt one, and are merely an extension of innate instincts to return to their tribal basis, because their species never went through the normal evolutionary process that sets civilized man apart from animals, like a group of apes.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I was unjustly sued for a civil tort twice in business with a frivolous lawsuit that would have cost me thousands of wasted dollars to fight, so I went to Stetson Law School in the St. Petersburg area and bought the necessary textbooks to carry on my own defense and was surprised to learn how easy it was to learn law.  It was a snap.  The biggest thing was the amount of time it takes away from everything else.  But the field is perfect for someone who is satisfied with being bored to death, and would fit in nicely as an employee for the military writing dry, dull military manuals or tax codes for the government.</p>

					<p>So this is your legacy to humanity? Blaming it all on &#8220;the blacks&#8221;? These folks in New Orleans are mostly descendents of poor slaves brought into port no more than ten miles from their flooded homes, kept poorly educated and miserably subservient   &mdash;  and at the hands of guess who? People with the elitist, keep-them-at-bay attitudes that many of you espouse. Many of these people   &mdash;   thousands of your fellow human beings   &mdash;  never had a chance from day one. </p>
<p>I pray that you evolve a little and treat these Biblically identified &#8220;lessers&#8221; with a little humanity and respect, and I don&rsquo;t mean the small numbers of thugs and thieves. How miserable must it be for so many of you to harbor such fear, hate and intolerance for a race your entire lives. It eats at you and grows like a malignancy. It colors your judgement and is passed on to your children and it fosters provincial, tunnel thinking that will keep you from growing and moving on spiritually and intellectually. </p>

<p>Equating a radical political movement with youthful street thugs is a stretch to say the least, but I would be ecstatic if American elites  &mdash;  attorneys for example  &mdash;  looked at street gangs with the same contempt that they do the Nazis. I don&rsquo;t recall anyone saying, &#8220;If we would give the Nazis love and understanding and stop our hatred and discrimination against them, maybe we could turn them into good little democrats.&#8221; </p>

					<p>It is always interesting to me, that the liberals who come here to post their defenses of blacks never seem to show any sympathy for the innocent black crime victims. In the New Orleans situation, as in the general day to day experience of black crime across the <span class="caps">US, </span>blacks make up the majority of the victims of black crime. </p>
<p>Were we to dramtically cut down on black criminality, the overwhelming beneficiaries of this action would be&hellip;blacks. Isn&rsquo;t that what you liberals want? Perhaps you&rsquo;d rather rail away against White racists, while <span class="caps">ALL </span>people suffer, due to the criminals whose actions you excuse.<br>

					<p>Steve,<br>
  You start out with a phrase, &#8220;Blaming it all on the blacks.&#8221; I&rsquo;m not sure what &#8220;it&#8221; refers to, but words like &#8220;all&#8221; are typical of people who debate unfairly. All excludes nothing and includes everything and is an attempt to establish that the person you&rsquo;re debating is rigid and myopic, unlike yourself, who always keeps an &#8220;open&#8221; mind. Thanks, by the way, for the spot on history lesson: many American blacks are descendants of slaves. That is the first time I&rsquo;d heard about that. <br><br>
  So blacks are &#8220;kept&#8221; poorly educated, eh? I&rsquo;m caucasian, but my grade school was right next to a huge all black housing project (are there any other kind?) in the 70&rsquo;s. The school was 80% black and quite the nightmare. You couldn&rsquo;t learn in that environment if you tried. The only ones that &#8220;kept&#8221; me &#8220;poorly educated&#8221; were the wild, out of control kids from the <span class="caps">PJ&rsquo;</span>s. But that&rsquo;s a horror story for another day. It&rsquo;s OK Steve, my sister and I came out of it all right (I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re concerned, seeing how benevolent you sound).<br><br>
  As for your challenge to &#8220;guess who&#8221; is keeping &#8216;em all so down, I think I know what you&rsquo;re getting at (we stupid, ignorant racists eventually catch on). It&rsquo;s people like me, of course. From up here in Indianapolis I keep the poor of New Orleans in their place just by my existence. You have so got me figured out, it&rsquo;s scary. <br><br>
  When you call us &#8220;elitists&#8221; in a smarmy, self-righteous letter like yours, the effect is really blunted. If a black is clearly racist do you hate them? If not, why not? I&rsquo;m your &#8220;fellow human being&#8221;, Steve, imperfect like the rest. If you hate my opinion, and tacitly me, you&rsquo;re being prejudiced. Yes you! Better pray about that tonight.<br><br>
  Regardless of what blanket generalities you project upon all not as enlightened as yourself, I don&rsquo;t hate anyone. Nor do I beleive the black race is as hopeless as you make them sound. Your coddling, &#8220;there, there, it&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;re fault&#8221; attitude towards them is why so many black Americans don&rsquo;t even try to better their lives on their own.<br><br>
  You say you pray for us? I seriously doubt that. I&rsquo;ve lived long enough to see that most liberals are actually very mean spirited. I think that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so often trying to be noticed &#8220;helping&#8221; this or that cause in a very overt way. Look how much I care! Please. Somebody look how much I care. Not like some people! Like Habitat for Humanity, it&rsquo;s all about being seen as compassionate, but more about being seen like the Pharisee on the street corner praying out loud, hoping to be heard. <br><br>
  You sound elitist when you refer to blacks as &#8220;Biblical lessers.&#8221; The Bible mentions the &#8220;first and the last&#8221; among humans, but didn&rsquo;t assign a race to them, as you have. I beleive all men are not only created equal, but forever remain so.<br><br>
  Hate to break it to you, but I&rsquo;m not at all miserable, as is your contention. Also, I don&rsquo;t use racist terms to describe anyone, nor do I try to indoctrinate others to my way of thinking, especially not children, as you charge. Maybe someday I can ascend to your spiritual and intellectual realm.<br><br>
  <span class="caps">NOW&hellip;S</span>teve-I read this a lot on this site until it&rsquo;s became a cliche`, but seriously, what do you think would happen if you were to be plunked down in South Central <span class="caps">L.A. </span>(or pick your own hell hole)at 3:00 am? Uh oh, Steve, here come da posse rollin&rsquo; up on ya! Thank God for that &#8220;Melanin Doesn&rsquo;t Matter&#8221; t-shirt you&rsquo;re wearing! They&rsquo;re likely illiterate (thanks to me) so you had better start yelling it, too.<br><br>
   All this having been said, I would truly respect you (somewhat) if (unlike most detractors and critics of this site) you would honestly answer this question: Where did you grow up and go to school? Be honest, Steve. Remember &#8220;heart and soul mean everything.&#8221; <br><br>

					<p>Robert Kelly says that the Black race is hated all over the world, especially in Asia. And he&rsquo;s right in many respects. But having served in the Air Force all over the globe, I can say this.  But regrettably, women of different races all over the world seem to enjoy Black men.  Why? The same reason the Black race is hated is the same reason women internationally like the spread their legs for them&hellip;..their animalistic, natural, and &#8220;undomesticated&#8221; nature.  What we view as their deviance is viewed as being dangerous and exciting by women in other cultures.  They felt men of their own cultures (and even some American White men) had become too stiff, boring, and &#8220;soft&#8221; (in other words, Metrosexuals!).   This view was especially prominent in Japan and certain parts of Europe.  That&rsquo;s why leaders in some of these countries are trying to keep Blacks out and denounce them; they know their women will be fascinated by these dark-skinned Americans, their savage arrogance and mannerisms, and the wild, sexually-suggestive music they bring (Blues, Jazz, <span class="caps">R&B,</span> Rap, Rock).  Think about it&hellip;who would a young woman in a foreign country view as more fun and sexually exciting: A metrosexual European dandy or some savage Black marine from Detroit? Women are fascinated with &#8220;warriors&#8221; and gladiators. That&rsquo;s why Black men (and White too) in the <span class="caps">NFL </span>and <span class="caps">NBA </span>can have their pick any woman they want. I&rsquo;m not saying if this is right or wrong&hellip;.it just is.</p>
<p>Writer Robert Howard once wrote that &#8220;Barbarism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural. And in the end, barbarism will triumph&#8221;.</p>
<p>Scary. But think about it. We may be able to intellectualize Black deviance and inferiority and present all kinds of facts and figures about their criminality, but are WE as White men the kind of men our girlfriends/wives depend on the protect them in a street fight?  Are we the kind of men that can provide enough mental, emotional, and physical support to our women to keep them from wondering if the grass is greener on the other side of the fence? Are we warriors?  It easy to point fingers at the Black race (and they make it so easy by their actions!), but are we as White men losing our manhood in an effort to become so appear so &#8220;civilized&#8221;?</p>

					<p>Unfortunately ignorance finds it&rsquo;s way in to every nook &amp; cranny civilization has to offer.  Why can&rsquo;t we talk about the <span class="caps">PEOPLE </span>in the Superdome?  Why does it have to be the black people, the white people, or the hispanic people?</p>
<p>You can take any group of lower class people and throw them in that situation and the results wouldn&rsquo;t be any different.  Most of those people didn&rsquo;t have anything to begin with, then they&rsquo;re stuck there for like 5 days with no food, water, or help coming.  Of course people&rsquo;s animalistic behavior is going to come out.  </p>
<p>We all know racism exists.  It&rsquo;s nothing new.  However, the media has done a glorious job of keeping it in the headlines and using it to fatten their pockets, not to mention keep us divided.  </p>
<p>Once you quit addressing the situation as black &amp; white, it&rsquo;ll quit being black &amp; white.  It will just be about people.  </p>
<p>I am <span class="caps">NOT </span>justifying any of the wrong doings.   </p>
<p>Post your hateful replies.  I won&rsquo;t argue with ignorance.  Enjoy yourselves.<br>

					<p>I have been saddened and appalled as I read and contemplated how thin the veneer of civilization is on many of us.  The only thing that keeps us from the law of the Jungle is not only our beliefs, but the practice of the Principle of Charity as Taught by Paul the Apostle of Jesus Christ.  Does this apply only to Whites, or the wealthy; Emphatically NO!!  It applys to all of God&rsquo;s children  abiding here on the earth.  THe Gospel of Love is all that will save us, not only from the ravages of hate, greed, lust, and selfishness but from ourselves..</p>
<p>When asked what was the greatest law of God,  Jesus said First is the love of God our Father and Creator, and the second is like unto it. &#8220;Love our fellow beings as ourselves..&#8221;  If I truly do this I will not hate, steal murder rape, or abuse my fellow brothers and sisters.  I will help them..</p>
<p>More than this there is nothing to say.. Know that the day will come when we will stand together before the Bar of Justice of our God and King, and He Knowing the true intents of our hearts, will judge us accordingly.  In that day many will cry out in anger, not realizing that we judge ourselves by our own actions.. As you live so will you be judged..</p>
<p>God is near He has not forsaken us, even thought we might think so..  All is well.  In the name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior..</p>

					<p>Seeds of insight have indeed been planted.  However, sustained effort might be required to have these seeds bear fruit!  The events in NO simply happened too quickly and were too numerous to be censored out by the liberal media.  White America began to see the truth.  How long will this recognition last?  How long before people forget?  It&rsquo;s a good bet that the footage we&rsquo;ve seen since the Katrina disaster will never be shown again.  During the next few weeks, more and more apologists for the criminal element (blacks) will come foreward to explain away the apalling behavior.  I&rsquo;m afraid that too many will think &#8220;That was <span class="caps">NO, </span>that can&rsquo;t happen here.&#8221;  I would recommend that Amren, or other responsible parties, start posting reader submitted stories of black violence, crime, and cultural decay.  While Amren has been a eye opening experience for me,  more might be reached if people could see accurate pictures, stories, and descriptions of black and hispanic behavior that occurs in their own neighborhoods.  There are millions of camera phones out there, and video technology is far mor accessible than it has ever been. What if individuals can submit their footage and allow the world to see what is happening all over the US?  The events in <span class="caps">NO, </span>while tragic, were only a concentrated and intesified version of happenings occuring across the US on any given day!  If people are able to see what is going on on a daily basis, and much closer to home, they might stop participating in their own destruction via multicult mythology. Let&rsquo;s wake up America while there&rsquo;s still an America to awaken!  This is my first post.  Thanks to the Amren staff and all the posters for waking me up! </p>

					<p>&#8220;Cassiodorus, I enjoy your insightful posts every time out - however, Teddy K was merely the sponsor of the Immigration Act of &#8216;65. Read Kevin MacDonald among others to discover the whole story behind that traitorous legislation&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of that. Teddy is merely useful as someone to whom to point as the &#8220;official&#8221; Bad Guy in the &#8216;65 legislation, as he&rsquo;s the one who stood on the floor of the Senate and lied through his teeth to the country about the legislation he was pushing. Then, as now, he couldn&rsquo;t have composed an actual piece of legislation to save his soul.</p>

					<p>Eh, JohnnyB, women who like men that are devil-may-care, slightly wild and a little reckless are one thing. It&rsquo;s understandable that they are attracted to very masculine men too(masculine, not macho). But, the women who enjoy the company of men who are brutish, disgusting and trashy are commonly called sl*ts and shouldn&rsquo;t even be considered. If they want a man they have to figuratively drag out of the jungle to mate with, then let &#8216;em. Who cares about those types of women? They will never be any different and it&rsquo;s better to have them singled out and identified for what they are. </p>
<p>I also doubt that either black OR white athletes get to have their pick of just any woman. Why would a worthwhile woman waste herself on a halfwit jock? No offense, but the type of women you might have met or encountered in the AF are not the best sample to go by. You apparently need to meet a better class of women. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to lower myself to act just like a black man to appear like a &#8220;warrior&#8221;. I think equating the character of black men with &#8220;warriors&#8221; is an insult to the concept. Their behavior is an insult to the ideal of true masculinity.</p>

<p>Rubbish. An absolute insult to white working class people. You know, the sort of people who you despise, yet who in peacetime drive the lorries and the tractors, and fix your taps&hellip;whatever, to make your world go round; and in war time are usually the ones getting killed on the front line saving your sorry a**e.</p>
<p>I am a proud descendent of white working class people, and grew up in that community. It wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but an underlying respect for property and for each other was always paramount. There is no way on Earth that decent, law abiding white working class folk would have carried on like they did in New Orleans. The tsunami victims behaved decently, the British did during the Blitz.</p>
<p>I am often asked if I hate blacks. The only people I honestly can say that I hate are those whites who express contempt for their own working class kindred, without whose efforts they would starve.</p>

					<b>What a shame&hellip;</b><p>
<p>It might be nice if Afric*ns could live and thrive and get along with their neighbors (us) as other groups can and do. It goes far beyond skin color; time and time and time again, no matter how wonderful specific members of their group are, Africans prove that there is something about them as a group, as a race, that makes it impossible for them to live in proximity peaceably and sanely with us. Luke <span class="caps">O&rsquo;F</span>arel of the UK claims it&rsquo;s not just the lower average <span class="caps">IQ.</span> He claims a higher percentage of African individuals have psycopathic personalities. So many of these people regularly, without a qualm, do things that almost no American would do under any circumstances. During the New Orleans debacle seven and eight-year old children were raped, had their throats slit, and their bodies stuffed into closets or freezers to hide the act, which was perpetrated by a nasty creature who used and discarded a child as an onanist uses and discards an old sock. Totally abhorrent! Something tells us the perpetrator was not one of he Australian tourists who were stuck in the stadium there&hellip;<br>
<p></p>
<p>Much could be said&hellip;. and much has been said by many people, even on this one page. However, nobody has yet to say it more succinctly than Thomas Jefferson, who pointed out that the two races, equally free, can not live under the same government.<p></p>
<p>We may always hope our neighbors have gotten an eyeful of &#8220;black culture&#8221; and have received sufficient fright to overcome their sheeple-like acceptance of the judeo liberal tolerance mania with which their brains have been washed for year upon year.<br>

					<p>StevenKeith,</p>
<p>Good points, especially about the ideal of true masculinity.  White <span class="caps">MEN </span>should act like White <span class="caps">MEN </span>and not try to mimic others, especially when we&rsquo;re on the top of the &#8220;food chain&#8221;.  And you&rsquo;re right&hellip;..I really do need to hang around a better class of women!</p>
<p>And Martin_uk, you are also right on point. I remember reading an article in a newspaper a couple of years ago about a young White working-class girl who was a freshman at Duke.  Her first roommate happened to be a Black girl from a poor single-parent household.  She said the her roommate got all kinds of financial aid packages and grants for tuition.  She also recieved invitations to join any one of the Black sororities on campus and was fully accepted into the &#8220;Black social scene&#8221; on campus. However, the White working-class girl said she had a difficult time getting any financial aid, no White sororities or organizations made any overtures toward her, and she and other working-class Whites were pretty much shut out of the campus social scene by the White students from the more well-to-do families.  She said Black poor to working-class students had a built-in support system on the campus, while poor to working-class White kids were just stuck out there with no support at all.  Who locked them out?  Other Whites who looked down on their working-class roots.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate the Black kids for supporting their own&hellip;.but like you, I am furious at how some White people treat their working-class kindred.</p>

					<p>Viewing the images from the Superdome, mostly all black and poor, and I noticed how many children these black mothers had. Most at least three. But what wasn&rsquo;t noticeable were the husbands or boyfriends. Not that I could recognize there being husbands/boyfriends, anyway. </p>
<p>I was also amazed that just about every female at the Superdome was pregnant! One says &#8220;my sister&rsquo;s eight months!&#8221;, another &#8220;my niece is three months!&#8221;, and &#8220;my daughter&rsquo;s about to give birth!&#8221; One would think having babies were a pasttime or hobby with them. </p>

					<p>Incidentally, I had heard that during the bus evacuation, &#8220;men were pushing aside the women and children&#8221;. Would this have been the black men, or the white men? The talking heads didn&rsquo;t say.</p>

					<p>I believe many of your readers are mistaken when they lump all blacks together. I think this is much more a question of social class. I have quite a few black friends who would not behave this way under any circumstance, except perhaps to loot for food, water, or medical supplies, in an emergency. (As would I, I might add.)</p>
<p>My friends from Africa are appalled by this behavior and in quiet moments complain about American blacks. My friends from Africa have only been here several years, but are more articulate and better workers than American blacks of the same economic class. They use their breaks to study and read newspapers and newsmagazines. They don&rsquo;t listen to gangsta rap music.</p>
<p>I am by no means a liberal. I have to deal with this social class of people all the time in Oakland, California. If I bump into one of them on the street by accident, they fail to hear the &#8220;excuse me&#8221; and look at me as if they want to stab me. When I was working in a Target store, they would bring in their children, try on new shoes, and then leave their old ones behind. I have more stories, but I won&rsquo;t bore you all.</p>

					<p>A very good article that caught the gist of the whole situation.  Mainly, the &#8220;black&#8221; problem that the mainstream media ignores with words, but cannot with pictures.</p>
<p>Another sad factor in this debacle is the very incompetent black Mayor and that nearly incompetent &#8220;woman&#8221; governor.  </p>
<p>I can only really remember one thing when I see a problem like this.  I recall a British statesman saying many, many, years ago that, &#8220;black people are white man&rsquo;s burden&#8221;.</p>
<p>New Orleans seems to bear this out compeletely.  There is nothing else to say.</p>

					<p>   To JohnnyB:  You are right in your argument about some white women who lust after non white men.  The reason they do is because they have been &#8220;taught&#8221; by our multicultural society that to <span class="caps">NOT </span>find black men attractive is to be &#8220;unenlightened&#8221;.  </p>
<p>    The multicult/diversity crowd has done a great job, with the help of hapless, brainwashed, intimidated whites, to make white females find black men attractive.  Yes, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s an element of &#8220;sexual adventurousness&#8221; in this endeavor, but most white females are smart enough to realize that there is <span class="caps">MORE </span>to life than <span class="caps">SEX. </span> Especially as females grow older.  Only the young put such an emphasis on sex.  </p>
<p>    As people grow older, that is intelligent people, they realize that companionship, shared interests, interesting conversation, dependability, maturity, loyalty, and other traits, are SO <span class="caps">MUCH </span>more important than sex.  In the scheme of things, sex is really so unimportant.  Maybe I&rsquo;m speaking more for myself, but, hey, that&rsquo;s the only person I am qualified to speak for.</p>
<p>    That is why one sees <span class="caps">ONLY </span>young white females with young black males.  Most of these white females will tire of Rasheem not working, of only wanting sex, and will ultimately find out that he is also &#8220;getting it&#8221; from other females too.   Which won&rsquo;t go over well with most white women.  White women like men who remain loyal to them.  Who in her right mind wants a philanderer?  And with the risk of sexual disease, who in her right mind would want a man whom she knows is sleeping around???</p>
<p>   Many of these white women don&rsquo;t have any respect for themselves, and that&rsquo;s why they are so easily influenced by these thug/hoodlum types.  </p>
<p>    I&rsquo;m  a firm believer in sexually segregated schooling until college.  If young girls were schooled without boys, they would focus on their schoolwork not the boy next to them.  And when they were educated and comfortable in their own shoes, they would be old enough to handle boys.  Right now, too many young girls are being led down the primrose path by too many of these thug types.  And the girls are not mature or confident enough to say no.  </p>
<p>    Just a few thoughts&hellip;&hellip;</p>

					<p>I find Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s article extreamly disturbing. Unfortunetly there is some truth to it but not the total truth. We as americans should really be addressing the real problem that is the cause for this foolishness and that is a lack of education.<br>
If the inner city educational system was where it should be this sort of thing probably wouldn&rsquo;t happen. One of the things that truly increase the level of racism in this country, is the fact that its taboo to talk about it. I find it disturbing that what a few fools have done, turns into to a grouping for a whole group of people. not all blacks are evil and not all white are good. both groups have enough fools, however, when it&rsquo;s whites it becomes an individual thing, or just a few, but when blacks are involved, what a few do becomes, that&rsquo;s how they <span class="caps">ALL </span>are. it is this thinking that will futher divide this country and eventuall destroy it. We as Americans need to increase our educational system and debate these problems to find a solution. Not a black or white solution but an american solution.<br><br>
This article was sent to me, i&rsquo;ve never read this paper, but now that i know how much of white america thinks (or at least these readers) tell me are they any better?<br><br>
 <br><br>
Regard  to solving these problems togather</p>

					<p>I know that I personnally went to Ms to help the people not knowing or caring what race they were. When I go there everyone black and white were in need and thankful for our help. But I have been told of a story of a family in Texas that took in a black family that had lost everything. Opening their home to them,but what did they get in return&hellip;&hellip;.. 2 of their daughters were raped by the men and their home was looted,then they left disappearing into Texas somewhere. What in the hell is going on here.

					<p>&#8220;&hellip;and they are coming to your state soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is what is frightening.  <span class="caps">FEMA </span>&#8220;took care of&#8221; the problem, they shipped the blacks all over the country, without warning, without asking.  Un-named, uninformed cities and towns have had these &#8220;black citizens&#8221; just arriving all over the country.  </p>
<p>One church camp in OK was leased by <span class="caps">FEMA </span>for at least 5 months to take in the evacuees but when word got out, they went on &#8220;standby&#8221; and no evacuees have arrived and probably won&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>Anyone trying to personally take aid, clothing, food, to the evacuees is turned away on the spot and sent elsewhere.  The evacuees are hidden, protected by armed guards from the communities where they arrive and usually no one knows they have arrived until they are already dispersed into homes and apartments.  Its like a big secret, no one is telling us where these africanized blacks are being shipped but they are being planted all over the US on unsuspecting communities witout notification, without permission, without asking.</p>
<p>Here, in Colorado Springs, we have a black community that works well together to create a better community and they have done a wonderful job.  Their part of the city is clean, green lawns and well cared for yards, gardens, flowers.  Homes cared for, in good repair, children well behaved and attending schools.  </p>
<p>Now moved in among them are the poorest of New Orleans blacks who may have no idea how to live in a community that works well together and no guarantee that they will even try to assimilate.</p>
<p>Plus they will become a burden on the destination state welfare system unless they will get work and become self-supporting of which we have no guarantee because they lived under the poverty line in NO and stayed that way, some not even knowing they were to evacuate until everyone was gone.  Some refused to leave, some didn&rsquo;t believe it would be that bad.  Then there are those who spent a week in the dome.  Those people are being dumped on communities nation wide with no warning.  The media is trying to keep this failure of civilization under wraps and unreported but word is seeping out of what really went on in <span class="caps">NO.  </span></p>
<p>If we have trouble, it won&rsquo;t be hard to know where it is originating, will it?</p>

					<p>All  that  so-called looting  is  just  playful  stuff  by a  bunch  of  black  youth.  Nothing  serious  at  all.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BUT  WHEN </span> IT  <span class="caps">COMES </span> TO  <span class="caps">SERIOUS  LOOTING,  RAPING,  LAND  THIEVING,  MUSEUM  STUFFING  WITH  LOOTED  BOOTY,  SLAUGHTER  AND  JUST  CAUSING  GENERAL  MAYHEM THE  EUROPEAN</span> IS  <span class="caps">THE  WORLD&rsquo;S  NUMBER </span> 1  <span class="caps">LOOTER.  GIVE HIM THE  GOLD  MEDAL  FOR  LOOTING </span> ON  <span class="caps">THE  GRANDEST  SCALE.</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">PROOF</span>: 1) Europeans  at  one  time  occupied  15%  of  the  World&rsquo;s  land  mass;  now  they  control  65%  on  account  of  their  great  skills  at  looting  lands,  resources  and  murdering  innocents.</p>
<p>2)The  big  museums  in  Europe  and  America contain  millions  of  looted  and  stolen  items  &mdash;  all  from  the  lands  the  pale  barbarians  invaded  to  rape  and  pillage.</p>
<p>3)Raping:  the  mixed  race  populations  of  Mexico,  Brazil,  Australia  and  parts  of  the  <span class="caps">USA  </span>all  result  from  the  barbarian&rsquo;s  penchant  and  uncontrollabe  disposition  for rape.<br>
There&rsquo;s  even  a  group  of  rape  products in  Namibia,  South  West  Africa who  have  been  designated  the  ethnic  name  &#8220;Basters&#8221;  &mdash;  all  the  bastard  products  of  European  rape  after  plunder  and  pillage.</p>
<p>So  the  boys  from  New  Orleans  were  just  having  a  playful  lark  &mdash;  a  tiny  pittance  and  acting  out  for  the  trillions  in  forced  labor value  owed  to  the  valiant  toilers  from  Africa  circa  1619  to  1865  and  beyond.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CONCLUSION</span>: The  Europe  has  the  very  enviable  record  of  looting  3  whole  continents  &mdash;  Australia,  North  America  and  South  America  then  squatting  on  those  looted  lands for  good.  </p>
<p>He  also  looted  the  whole  of  Africa  but  valiant  fighters  like  Samory  and  Tshaka  Zulu  forced him to  rethink  his  designs.  Not  to  mention  the  auxiliary  work  by  Africa&rsquo;s  best  friend  during  the  invasion  era: the  doughty  and  pesky  mosquito: plasmodium  falciparum.</p>
<p>The  pale  barbarian  also  tried  to  loot  China  first  by  attempting  to  drug  the  pig  tailers  to  sleep  with  opium  but  <span class="caps">MAO </span>eventually  rallied  his  cohorts  and  drove  them  and their local  minions  to  Taiwan  and Europe.</p>

<p>Well put. This Occam wannabe is just trying to push the usual white guilt trip by spewing anti-white hate. That and screaming &#8220;RACIST&#8221; is all the cultural Marxists have left to try to deflect the obvious truth the New Orleans rioting has brought to the bright light of day.</p>
<p>Wannabe Occam, you need a new line. The old arguments just don&rsquo;t wash anymore. Take your racist, black supremist, antiwhite propoganda somewhere else. You look the fool trying to peddle your wares here.<br>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a good deal of time talking to Canadians about the differences between Canada and America. When they would ask me why there is so much crime &amp; violence in America I would tell them:We are a more diverse population, diversity leads to conflict, and most of the violence is committed by minorities.  The typical reaction was one of horror outside of Toronto. In Toronto there are many that understand, even though they have nowhere near the black population of my city.  This event has partially opened up their eyes. I still get a few with the horror reaction, but I get a lot more that are figuring out that they don&rsquo;t want what America has become in their country. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived with people from a lot of different ethnic backgrounds. I&rsquo;ve also lived abroad in mostly homogenous countries, where even heroin dealers say Please and Thank you, and you have no reason to be afraid anywhere. <br>
    When I lived in the city of St Louis I had mostly Iranian and Iraqi neighbors, plus a lot of Bosnians that moved in after their home was under UN occupation.  For the most part, there were few problems.  When my neighborhood changed and a few apartments became section 8, it was like a domino effect on my neighborhood. One block became black, the crime rate soared, my home was broken into, my neighbors home, their car stolen, a child shot. Good people moved out, and more places went section 8. Block by block they literally became a blight and a rolling crime wave.  I was driven out of what was a decent neighborhood, where people actually swept the back alleys and porches and looked after it. Not because of poverty, not because of a corrupt city government, not because of high taxes, or bad roads or anything else -  no those things were trivial in comparison to the damage done by blacks.  My Iranian and Iraqi and Bosnian neighbors were also driven out. </p>
<p>Then I moved to the county, and now I&rsquo;m about to be driven out again. This time by a combination of illegal Mexicans and blacks moving in.  Worse, I know its being sanctioned by the banks that are writing the loans.  I&rsquo;ve seen the advertisements they use in Mexico, offering loans to come here for illegals with a step by step guide to get through the process.  I curse the people that brought the blacks over in the first place, and for not shipping them all off to Liberia when it was politically possible to do so.   I can&rsquo;t believe this nation is stupid enough to do it again with Mexicans and Hatians. I hate the corporations, government, and bankers who are foisting this upon us. If anyone needs to be asked: Why do you hate America?   Its them. </p>
<p>Our enemies are more than left leaning liberals who live in gated communities that preach this nonsense. They are more than the sad blacks and illegals we have now causing blight, crime, and chaos wherever they go. Keep that in mind. </p>
<p>Whether its culture, or a failure to evolve I do not know, I lean toward the latter these days -  but I know the effect is the same everywhere an area becomes largely black and/or latino.  I don&rsquo;t know a humane way to solve this, I&rsquo;m not sure there is one. It would be a start to halt immigration from people of color and deport the illegals already here. However, we already have such a large population of them, that we can&rsquo;t easily just ship them off. Its nearly impossible to imprison all of them that commit crimes, we would have to have prisons for 20 million people + deport probably 30 million more (Deporting isn&rsquo;t so hard&hellip;its just expensive), the expense would be huge. Not that we aren&rsquo;t subsidizing the vast majority of them already, and probably to a greater dollar amount - much of it indirect subsidy - losses from crime.  </p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas that don&rsquo;t involve mass extermination &amp; mass forced relocation I would love to hear them. It just doesn&rsquo;t seem possible to integrate them into our society, every attempt has failed. New Orleans is just the latest example of that failure.  We can&rsquo;t fit square pegs into round holes, and its foolish to continue trying to. We may well be stuck with the ones who are here forever, and the burden of that never seems to end.  How do we fix this folks?  What is really possible to do about it?  </p>

					<p>The myth that whites are oppressors and blacks are victims was totally blown out of the water with what happened in New Orleans. I would encourage white people to stop with this guilt trip about black oppression and I would encourage blacks to stop blaming whites for everything and learn to stand on their own. Stop expecting white people to take care of you! True racial equality comes when all races are held to the exact same societal standards. We whites need to stop lowering our expectations of blacks and start demanding that they become productive members of society like everyone else. But most of all, <span class="caps">BLACK PEOPLE THEMSELVES </span>need to start demanding that of their own people, instead of blaming others. Then Martin Luther King&rsquo;s &#8220;I have a dream&#8221; speech will become reality, I think. </p>
<p>But what do I know? Just an observation. </p>

					<p>1. If Jared Taylor is going to take chunks out of major news media reports then he needs to credit those reporters.</p>
<p>2. And if one of the chunks is quotes from frightened Whites at the convention center taken word for word from an AP report he shouldn&rsquo;t go on to say that major news media outlets weren&rsquo;t reporting it.</p>
<p>3. God forbid any of us ever find ourselves in these desperate circumstances - this country has never faced anything like it before. It only takes a 10% population of outright criminal thugs with guns to make it even harder for everyone else.  </p>

					<p>Well,  my  piece  was  simply  to  show  that  the  white  hysteria  about  black  looting  is patently  hypocritical:  whites are  known  to  be  world&rsquo;s  biggest  and  most  efficient  looters.  No  offense  meant  &mdash;  just  sticking  with  the  facts.</p>
<p>On  my  choice  of  &#8220;Occam&#8221;:  only  because  he  is  associated  with  a trenchant  and  economical style  of  discourse.</p>
<p>But  sure  there  have  been  pre-modern  black  philosophers.  How  about  Ahmed  Baba of  Timbuktoo;  his  books  are  there  for  all  to  see.  And  Plotinus  the   founder  of  Neoplatonism  &mdash;  who  hailed  from  Lycopolis  in  Upper  Egypt(i.e.) from  the  vicinity  of  Nubia in  Northern  Sudan. There  are  others  such  as  William  Amo  &mdash;  from  West  Africa  &mdash;    who  lived  in  Germany  in  the  17th  century  &mdash;  his  publications  are  also  there  for  all  to  see. And  Zara  Yakob of  18th  century  Ethiopia. But  space  is  limited  so  I  won&rsquo;t  pile  on.</p>

     With modern technology, mass deportation is no longer necessary.<br><br>
Using the framework that Dr. William Shockley proposed, the answer is in voluntary sterilisation, induced by generous cash bonuses for every point below median IQ level.<br><br>
By this plan it should be possible to reduce the non-desirable portion of society to a vanishingly small fraction of the population, peacefully, over a period of generations to our posterity.</p>

<p>The fact is, you&rsquo;re trying to make excuses for bad black behavior while piling on white guilt, and it no longer works.</p>
<p>Pulling incidents of whites behavior in war in regards to their opponents from hundreds and thousands of years ago and warping them to fit a ridiculous comparison to what happened in New Orleans with blacks raping their <span class="caps">OWN </span>(you get that part dummy, their <span class="caps">OWN</span>) community is just displaying your anti-white hate and bigotry. More importantly it&rsquo;s showing off your lack of ability to reason properly.</p>
<p>Why do people like you have such a tenuous grasp on logical comparisons? Oh yeah, you have an agenda. Take your anti-white hate to blackplanet.com or somewhere else.</p>
<p>During this crisis, whites as a whole pulled together and showed the better qualities of their nature. Blacks, well, they did what they do in times of crisis.</p>
<p>Who are you kidding at this point?<br>

Concepts such as common decency seem to be completely foreign to these individuals. Most of the victims of these criminals were black. And I&rsquo;m sure many of the blacks in these neighborhoods were utterly disgusted by what they were seeing. Think <span class="caps">CNN </span>will air those people? No, there just gonna air the ones who say that Dubya doesn&rsquo;t care about blacks, thus perpetuating white, bad, black victim. I don&rsquo;t buy it, and neither should you.  </p>

Altough I&rsquo;ve felt like this about black people for a long time now, I&rsquo;ve never ever had it confirmed in such a put article like this.  Others have said &#8220;pictures don&rsquo;t lie&#8221; and they sure weren&rsquo;t after katrina.  Thanks for an excellent piece of work, that I too will pass on to friends and co-workers.  I know that my friends and I would help out as much as possible, instead of just looting as much as possible.  Bookmark site= Check :-).</p>

					<p>This is a good article.  However, I&rsquo;m not really that surprised by the events that unfolded in New Orleans after Katrina.  In fact, by what I&rsquo;ve seen and read in recent times and in the past with blacks in Africa and the <span class="caps">US, </span>the looting mentality is quite obvious and not really that new.  It appears to be a cultural thing with a majority of blacks.  They tend to glorify people and events that many whites would find apprehensible to say the least.  This culture is destructive in nature and will only lead to things like murder, rape, tyrannical dictators, corruption, ect.  This is in stark contrast to the chivalry code of the knights.  Once again, there&rsquo;s nothing new under the sun with the way blacks behaved during this crisis.</p>

					<p>This is a group of people that would rather drown than help themselves.  It is truly sad when you think about it.  Generation after generation of handouts and no one ever telling them that they are responsible for themselves.  This is one of the results of <span class="caps">LBJ&rsquo;</span>s &#8220;Great Society&#8221; (not!)ideas. I do believe that people have to help each other but that they also have to stop being victims.  Black people are victims of themselves and and liberal extremists that they falsely believe have their best interests at heart.  White people have become victims through ignorance and putting on the blinders.  They have to stop thinking that we &#8220;owe&#8221; black people something because we don&rsquo;t.  Black people have the ability to make their lives as fulfilling as anyone else does.  They just need a different mentality.  The sooner we stop thinking for them the better.  It is clear that there is a very big problem here.</p>

					<p>I as a United States citizen I believe in not finding fault, but a remedy. Certain segments of the media have tainted and exploited the pain and suffering of people to #1 sell more papers. #2. superimpose racism to the fullest. #3.Desecrate the United States morality and priortization. Note: Making us vulnerable in the eyes of America and the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violence in the midst of chaos is not new. What I find a disgrace is why <span class="caps">FEMA </span>protocol has been changed. President Jimmy Carter developed <span class="caps">FEMA. FEMA </span>originally dealt directly with the president, now channels and politics have dissolved it&rsquo;s original plan. The National Guard should have been the calvary in light of any crisis. The cart was put before the horse. This is unexcusable. The eighty second Airborne can be deployed anywhere in the world in eighteen hours yet we failed to take care of home first. The carnival cruiselines were not utilized. Yet during riots and chaos National Guard are deployed in an instant. I noticed that there are those who try to find fault with the Mayor of New Orleans and the Govenor,yet stop to think that this was not a city or state issues, but three states that were effected. This included Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. This is a national crisis. Those of you who take a stance on moral issues and know right from wrong, God Bless You and those of you who are consumed with racism, anger, frustration and rage you are the cause for the internal erosion of the United States. Together We Stand, Divided We Fall.</p>

					<p>Thank you, Mr. Taylor, for a wonderful article. It&rsquo;s refreshing to see someone telling the truth about race. </p>
<p>The obvious conclusion one can draw from reading this piece is that blacks simply do not belong in white society. Africans (and mestizos and Asians, for that matter) are not only alien to Western civilization, but also detrimental to it. Black people are bad for whites. Blacks lower the tone of white civilization. </p>
<p>I have no moral hesitation in saying that the solution is to remove blacks (and mestizos and Asians) from Euro-American society. This can be accomplished through mass sterilization, incarceration, or repatriation. The alternative would be civil war, which Africans and their non-white comrades will surely lose.</p>

					<p>I think this debate is rather simple. we are dealing here with combination of genetic inferiority,lower evolutionary development and degenerate culture. It is clear that blacks are about a thousand years behind whites and other races, the europeans in dark and early middle ages behaved the same way. As a European living in US and someone who loves my adopted country feel that the media had done a major disservice to american image by continuously showin the images of barbarity. In fact, it is true that asian people in the third world behaved far superiorly to these savages. Thank you Jared for writing a thoughtful and thruthful article</p>

					<p>We, whites, were just as savage, just as primitive as a race not so long ago (500 to 1200 years ago). It is not in our genes or any other group&rsquo;s  to be otherwise. It is the 20 or 50 generations of programming and conditioning and possibly one or two fortunate but accidental behavioural tick/shifts that has made us different. </p>
<p>For this civilizational refinement (a few world wars notwithstanding) we, whites, should be moderately revered forever. Emphasize the moderate part. We should not be celebrating &#8220;black africain culture&#8221; any more  than we celebrate gallic, gothic, viking, or norman culture. Something quaint to pull out at weddings and births. Nothing more. If once in a while  a black like Washington Carver and his peanut butter, or Mile Davis&rsquo;s ballads come up from the swamp of self pity and entitlement otherwise known as the North Amercian black world so much the better. They&rsquo;re great guys. But they aint&rsquo; holy.  </p>

					<p>As a conservative-white-Christian-Republican who has tried to convince other white Republicans of the need to reach out to conservative-minded blacks and Hispanics to prepare, politically, for the inevitable demographic changes that our nation is experiencing, I must confess that the images coming from New Orleans, described by Mr. Taylor, and taken in with my own eyes as well, will make my endeavor much more difficult.</p>
<p>The cultural differences that we witnessed were quite obvious and extremely disturbing.  My cautious optimism about the ultimate &#8220;coming together&#8221; of racial groups in America has been irreparably harmed.  While I do ot approve of everything Jared Taylor penned in this piece (for example, recent reports seem to indicate that the violence inside the Superdome and convention center in New Orleans, reported with much glee and passion by the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media, was significantly exaggerated), I have to admit that the vast majority of his article appears to be right on the mark.  I sincerely doubt that any folks in the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media or the pseudo-mainstream conservative media will have the courage to touch on the sensitive racially-charged issues that Taylor addresses.  For displaying that courage, he should be commended.<br>

					<p>Thanks for your honest and truthful approach to this terrible event. We both survived the Hurricane and more importantly the dome&hellip;There were times we thought we would not make it out, but we did and the one thing that got us through it and kept us sane was the support we had from individuals of the National guard and the Army; these people deserve medals for not only saving our lives, but also for tolerating the abuse they received from a majority of people inside that dome, just for doing their job! We also thank the media of both of our countries Australia and England, for all their help in the aftermath of this terrible disaster. Particular thanks must go to Staff Sgt <span class="caps">OGDEN </span>and Bud Hopes (Australia) for comforting and leading us and the other 100+ travellers who were caught up in this. Probably of most importance however, is that we hope the people and culture of New Orleans can recover from this disaster, and that the city find a new energy and spirit. We hope that future leaders of America will not forget it&rsquo;s people in a time of need, whether black/white, rich/poor; that race or creed should make no difference in the treatment and rescue of needy humans. Thanks again,</p>

Since 1994, the advent of the &ldquo;new&rdquo; South Africa standards have slipped in a way outsiders will not be able to imagine. When I came to this country in 1970 with my parents, still in school, it was a paradise. For nearly 350 years Whites had build a country on this dark continent that was nearly as good as any first world country.</p>
<p>Eleven years after <span class="caps">UHURU </span>we have a situation nearly as bad as in the rest of Africa. Approximately one million White South Africans have already left and are now living in Australia, New Zealand, Britain, the <span class="caps">USA,</span> Canada and other countries. More are leaving everyday.  </p>
<p>For all those Black apologists here are some statistics about crime in <span class="caps">S.A. </span>per day. 60 children are raped, 55 murders take place, 129 women are raped, 817 houses are broken into, 52 cars are hi-jacked. </p>
<p>Murder is at a rate of 48 out of 100000 population in <span class="caps">SA.</span> In the <span class="caps">USA </span>it&rsquo;s 6 out of 100000 population (did I hear anybody complain about crime in the US?), in Europe it&rsquo;s 2  out of 100000 population.</p>
<p>Only 6% of all violent crimes reach sentencing in a court here in South Africa.</p>
<p>In one of the worst car-hijackings to date two white women and a baby-girl were killed. The car was hi-jacked in the middle of Pretoria by blacks on a Thursday evening and taken to the outskirts. The older woman was shot on the way and thrown out of the car in the streets of Pretoria. The baby was shot in the face because it as crying. The younger woman was raped and shot. They, mother and grandmother of the baby, had celebrated the infants first birthday. The father was unfortunately not able to make it due to work.</p>
<p>People usually refer to killers like that as animals, but hey, have a heart, animals have feelings as well.</p>
<p>Other standards are slipping as well. Education has been downgraded for ten years now to accommodate the Blacks who were unable to perform to White standards. </p>
<p>The beautiful national road system we used to have is deteriorating in such a way that police are arresting anyone who drives in a straight line for drunken driving. If you were sober you would be dodging the potholes.</p>
<p>Health care, this is the country that made the first heart transplant, are in such a state that patients in state-hospitals are sleeping two or three in a bed. Children are born on the floor, legs and arms are accidentally amputated off patients who are in hospital for minor ailments.</p>
<p>Of course a lot of the Whites who were in charge of things and knew what was going on, have been retrenched and replaced by Blacks who are to stupid to write their own name. Nearly two-thirds of a nearly all black police force is illiterate. (Must be the Whites fault or what do I say Mr. or Mrs. Appalled and Horrified?) </p>
<p>So any idiot out there who thinks that Jared Taylor is nothing but a racist should come and visit us here. In no time you would realize that what is going on in NO is a Sunday school picnic compared to what Blacks achieve on a daily basis here in South Africa. Just be quick about it, because firstly in a few years time there might be nothing to visit and as for me, I am leaving this dump after 35 years and returning to my country of birth next year. It is not easy but there is nothing left here for any self-respecting white person.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I must add that consecutive US Presidents, some even Conservatives, have helped to bring this situation about by helping the terrorists who are now in power and demanding the release of that terrorist Mandela, instead of listening to the Whites of this country.<br>

					<p>This is an extremely well written article and the author presents a very cogent argument.  It only confirms my beliefs and what I&rsquo;ve known for a long time.  Unfortunately, I must work and live amongst blacks and I see   &mdash;   on an almost daily basis   &mdash;   the degenerate culture of indolence, dependency and shiftlesness that characterizes them.  Unfortunately, in our politically correct society, I cannot voice these opinions in public.  </p>
<p>It will be an interesting social experiment to see what happens to communities where the black Katrina &#8220;evacuees&#8221; have moved   &mdash;   Utah, in particular.  What will happen to their crime rates, public education, social services, property values, police force in the future?  Sadly I see more cities becoming like New Orleans in the future.  </p>

					<p>For me, Jared Taylor&rsquo;s piece helped to crystalize the disconnect between the images which I witnessed on my TV screen in the aftermath of the hurricane and the ludicrous spin propagated through mainstream media outlets. The rapid descent of New Orleans into an environment of Nietzschean savagery could in no way be attributed to the Federal Government&rsquo;s admittedly imperfect response to the crisis. In Indonesia, the devastation wrought by the tsunami had been even more widespread and isolating, yet its victims did not surrender to self-pity or engage in racialistic assaults on other victims or insanely self-destructive attacks upon rescue personnel. But while the nature of the citizens who remained in the city undoubtedly was significant, I believe that what passes for &#8220;Black&#8221; culture in America, dominated by pathological &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; subculture and enabled by White liberals, also played a major role in the behavior that was displayed.</p>

					<p>Thanks for this very true account of what happened in New Orleans - the liberal media in the form of Brian Williams an <span class="caps">NBC </span>anchorman stated that this was the story of the &#8220;Haves and the Have Nots&#8221; - <span class="caps">WRONG.</span> This was the story of a lack of Personal Responsibility!! As a native New Orleanian I stayed for Katrina and I&rsquo;ve been here for several hurricanes including Betsy in 1965 when the same flooding occurred. There were no riots then - people helped each other. But during the subsequent 40 years more and more welfare has been given - now there are 4 &amp; 5 generations of the same family on welfare. They won&rsquo;t take care of their needs - they are too used to having someone else take care of them - welfare, food stamps, <span class="caps">SSI, </span>free medical care, reduced rent, etc. There are a lot of black people in New Orleans who work hard to achieve the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; - but there are many more who sit back and take and take and take!! The main stream media has never reported what really goes on here and I&rsquo;m tired of being blamed for someone else&rsquo;s laziness, stupidity and criminal behavior. The entertainment industry has finally started a campaign - you know the ads that say &#8220;Don&rsquo;t drink &amp; drive&#8221; - &#8220;Don&rsquo;t have sex until you&rsquo;re married&#8221; - &#8220;Integrity - pass it on&#8221; - &#8220;Love your children&#8221; - too little - too late!! Everyone in America - black or white - has to pull their own weight. I&rsquo;ll help anyone who wants to help themselves - but not those who just want it handed to them! New Orleans has been primarily black for a long time - we&rsquo;ve had black Mayors for many years - our roads are full of holes, our infrastructure is so bad - it is beyond belief. Our levees have been neglected - not by the Corps of Engineers - but by our own local politicians. The 17th St. Canal levee was breeched on the New Orleans side - but not on the Metairie side - that alone should be a red flag - Metairie is mostly white. The black politicians&rsquo; neglect is criminal. As to the people who stayed in New Orleans - a lot of them stayed for one reason - to protect their property from the animals who stayed to loot. What they couldn&rsquo;t steal - they trashed or burned. Why didn&rsquo;t the media tell the real story?</p>

					<p>2,000 years ago, the Romans were saying the exact same things about all of your ancestors. 1,000 years ago, the Monarchs of Europe were saying the same things about peasants. 100 years ago the aristocracies of Europe were saying the same thing about the poor of Europe. Yesterday, the folks living in the nicer neighborhood, living in the bigger house, driving the nicer cars and making the bigger salaries are <strong>still</strong> saying the same things about you.</p>

					<p>I believe that anyone caught looting for anything other than food, water and diapers for their children should go to jail.  I also know that the media did not show the blacks that were helping other blacks and whites.  The media never wants to show the good things that blacks do.  If a person commits a crime they should pay for it no matter what their skin color is.  Their are people who commit crimes of all skin colors.  For example just look at Ireland where whites kill other whites all the time.  That has nothing to do with blacks.  Also look at the serial killers in the <span class="caps">USA </span>almost all of them are white.  Unfortunately, like one person said about 98% of people are good and the rest make it bad for everyone else regardless of anyone&rsquo;s skin color.  </p>

					<p>all i ask is, was the write of this article there? it has already been documented that these reporst of rape and murder were untrue. <br>
this was written from a bias point of view. Seemingly, his perception of African Americans is stereotypical. thus his reporting is reflective. <span class="caps">SAD. </span>why is it acceptable to believe that skin color measures character. why do we contine to put physical features on invisible qualities&hellip;</p>

Perhaps more practical than advocating and arranging for renewed segregation and the removal of various ethnic groups, many of whom predate the major white immigrations of the 1800s would be to focus on a program for the evacuation of ethnic caucasians to Frace.  Banana boat for Serbia and Voivodina, anyone?  No black problem there!</p>

					<p>Gee- I wonder why blacks today are like this? Maybe because just <span class="caps">YESTERDAY, WHITE MEN </span>prevented them from getting an education, and good jobs.. So, only 50 years later, memories of &#8220;No colored&#8221; signs still fresh in their childhood memories, they are still passing this ignorance and anger on down to their children. </p>
<p>It is because of ignorant, racist white fucks like you that created this monster that we have today. England blacks are just as educated as English whites- and sound exactly the same over the phone. </p>
<p>Your oppression is still fresh. This looting, and violence, and theft, is left over from just one generation ago. </p>
<p>If I held whites in slavery for the next 200 years, and suddenly ended my rule over them- I gaurantee you that it would take them alot more than 50 years after that oppression to catch up to the rest of society. </p>
<p>Morons. The only race issues we have are the ones that you <span class="caps">MADE, </span>and the ones that you perpetuate.</p>

					<p>This has been great reading. For those who think what happened in New Orleans will serve as a sort of &#8216;wake-up call&rsquo; for deluded whites, I have to disagree if you mean <span class="caps">CONSCIOUS </span>awareness. That it&rsquo;s all understood on some mysterious subliminal level, then yes, quite true, I think it will. I work with a guy from a well-to-do family in New Orleans, and it&rsquo;s a funny psychological trick: he deliberately focussed on unimportant details, and overlooked the big picture. It&rsquo;s a reflex that effectively blocks any politically incorrect bit of information from entering the conscious part of the psyche, those unwanted racist fragments get dumped into the unconscious, and are processed in funny ways. Jung observed that for whites, black people represent a projection of primitive instinct. This is especially pronounced in white people with carefully subordinated instincts themselves, people with no dialogue with their own instinctual side. The corporate world is full of such people.</p>

					<p>I have to say this article is amazing!  It is about time that someone speaks the truth.  I recently stumbled onto this article while researching some facts about the New Orleans tragedy. My search came about because I had a young black male who was visiting my neighbor yell &#8220;Bush hates black people&#8221;.  It was so loud that several alarmed neighbors ran outside in this normally quiet neighborhood.  I responded back with &#8220;That is not true and stop yelling in my neighborhood!&#8221;  I could only assume that this stemmed from the idiotic statements of the non-talented, attention seeker, Kanye West, although altered some (original was &#8220;Bush doesn&rsquo;t care about black people&#8221;), which figures.  </p>
<p>Since, I have begun to ponder why primarily the black community seems to constantly be complaining, despite all of the programs in effect to help them, at everyone else&rsquo;s expense.  I  recall my great-grandparents and grandparents who escaped a hostile government, struggled to make it to America (my great-grandfather worked for 7 years in America until he could afford to send for his wife and children), were able to work hard to make a better life for their family and contribute to their community and society, despite the depression, World War <span class="caps">II, </span>having to learn English, and yes discrimination - all this and more without the benefit of these special programs - Why  were they  able to do all of this ON <span class="caps">THEIR OWN </span>and not utter one word of complaint?  Ever!  No one helped them and they never asked for it.  They worked hard for everything they had.  </p>
<p>Certainly this article points out many of the differences between races.  One that I have observed directly, having lived in several black communities, is that many blacks (not all) only seem to care about &#8220;what&rsquo;s in it for them&#8221;.  &ldquo;Where is my money?&rdquo;  They complain constantly about how everyone should care about them but seem to care very little or not at all about other people - and as pointed out in this article, expect other people to help them get what they want.  Unfortunately, this seems to have been perfected by the 60&rsquo;s generation of liberals who back them up at every turn and are now pushing their warped sense of reality onto our youth.  This is why we see articles that corporate America is having difficulty in finding leaders in our youth of today.  Too many expect something, something handed to them for free.  Look at the sports industry, we are at a time when the players only care about the salary, or their fame.  Sadly this mindset  permeated most of our society (at least where I live).  What ever happened to doing your job to the best of your ability?  What happened to the work ethic?   I certainly agree that all men are equal and should each be given a fair opportunity, but it has become ridiculous!  America is that opportunity. </p>

					<p>Sad but true, if there were more of these disasters, more of the world would see the black reaction,of course, if the media would tell it like it is or was.The article in the newsletter for March is very good, too bad not everybody could get the whole story on the Katrina disaster.Is it any wonder why no one wants to do anything for  blacks, or why they can&rsquo;t exist in normal humanity! They obviously can&rsquo;t even live or get along with each other,so who would expect anything different with anybody else in any disaster.</p>

					<p>I find it very disturbing to read some of these comments&hellip;. or most of the comments on this page and article. It is just crazy how much racism still is out there as prevelant than I ever expected until events such as this, or the dragging of the black man in Jasper, TX etc. <br>
Knowledge is power and when you have no knowledge of the black experience and culture you have no right to comment on it as if you would know what to do or how to react in such instances as these. What you saw on TV is just a bit of what was really occurring down there in New Orleans. If you just lost everything that you had and you had children and the elderly to feed. No one in there right mind can sit there and say that they would not loot to survive. Yes in any instance someone will always take advantage of the situation and go for items that are not of survival substance. However, that is pure ignorance and we can not blame or look down at anyone who does that cause nevertheless, there is &#8220;Poor White Trash&#8221; in this world too. But unfortunately, media does not like to Blast that all over the television. So who are we to judge. You don&rsquo;t see Black People talking about the predoimnately white people who live in trailer parks or the &#8220;white&#8221; people who we see on a daily basis in the media killing there children, husbands and wives and claiming temporary insanity. We dont boast around calling all white people crazy and trash becuase this is what we see in the media.  There is Freedom of Speach and when people speak out such as &#8220;Kanye West&#8221; that does not make him a racists. You can look in as many white people&rsquo;s cd player and you will find his cd. Only cause this man speaks the truth and does not bite his tongue much like Eminem&#8221; So is he racist against his own people who are &#8220;White&#8221;. Everyone really needs to take some opportunity to learn more about the cultures that America is made of and The <span class="caps">BLACK</span> Culture is a big part of it. And just maybe instead of trying to be dark like us &#8220;tanning&#8221; when once you hated us and our black skin, maybe you should learn a bit more and stop being so close minded. <br><br>
No one can speak on this but the individuals who were down there. Just cause you contributed or gave away some of your old items in your home does not make you bigger or better than the next man who is suffering from poverty despite how they got there or still remain in poverty.<br><br>
DO <span class="caps">NOT</span> Judge, That is God&rsquo;s job&hellip;. Think about it!</p>
