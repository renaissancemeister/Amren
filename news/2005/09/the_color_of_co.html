<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><b>Crime Alert&mdash;August 19, 2005:</b> The Ithaca Police Department is investigating a strong-armed robbery that occurred at approximately 11:45 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 18, 2005, in the Collegetown area.&hellip; The victim reported that his attackers were three to four males in their late teens or early 20s, and at least one of the attackers was wearing a long white T-shirt. <br>
<br>
<b>Crime Alert&mdash;August 29, 2005:</b> The Ithaca Police Department is investigating a robbery/assault that occurred in the 300 block of College Avenue on Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2005, at approximately 1:30 a.m. The female student victim was walking with friends when she was assaulted by a group of females. The suspects reportedly punched the victim several times and tore her clothing&hellip; The victim reported that the group who assaulted her were several black females and one white female. The victim further described one of her attackers as being a heavy-set black female wearing glasses and having braids in her hair. <br>
<br>
<b>Crime Alert&mdash;August 30, 2005:</b> The Ithaca Police Department is investigating a strong armed robbery that occurred at approximately 1:30 a.m., Aug. 29, near the intersection of Campus Road and Mary Ann Wood Drive, below West Avenue. The male victim was walking on Campus Road when he was approached by two male subjects. The victim reported that one subject asked him a question, then both physically assaulted him, taking the duffel bag he was carrying. The suspects were last seen running east on Campus Road. The victim described his attackers as being two black males, both approximately 5 feet 9 inches tall and approximately 17 years of age. <br>
<br>
Cornell University students were sent the preceding crime alerts as the end of August ushered in a crime wave high above Cayuga&rsquo;s waters. In a September 6 article in the <i>Daily Sun</i>, Ithaca Police Department Lt. Tim Williams admitted &#147;Typically we don&rsquo;t see as many [crimes in Collegetown] in such a short period of time.&#148; Williams&rsquo; advice to Cornell students was to use &#147;common sense&#148; and &#147;always be cognizant of your surroundings, be aware of the people around you.&#148; <br>
<br>
What exactly are &#147;common sense&#148; precautions? What &#147;people&#148; should we be aware are around us? The unspoken answer to these questions (as well as the proverbial 800-pound gorilla in the middle of the room) is this: watch out for gangs of black thugs. </p>
{snip}
<p>
The awful truth is that 90 percent of the approximate 1,700,000 interracial violent crimes reported each year involve black perpetrators and white victims. Using data obtained from the FBI and Bureau of Justice Statistics, The New Century Foundation produced a ground-breaking study, <i>The Color of Crime</i>, which revealed the great disparities in crime rates among the various races.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If all of these numbers are correct, then why don&rsquo;t we hear more about black-on-white crime from the media? The answer is because it would be deemed politically incorrect and racist to point out a minority&rsquo;s shortcomings (i.e. a 70% illegitimacy rate, grossly disproportionate assault, murder, rape, and armed robbery rates, etc). Who&rsquo;s to blame the media though? Such a gross detail of violence would most definitely spark NAACP backlash or Jesse Jackson tongue-lashings. </p>
{snip}
<p>
But how many national stories and vigils were held for the four whites who were brutally raped and murdered by blacks in Wichita in 2000? Why does nobody know about them? This is equally as bad as Byrd&rsquo;s death yet it was not made national news. The reason is because the victims were white and the guilty parties were black. Had the prosecution gone national, as Byrd&rsquo;s murderers&rsquo; trial did, then there would have been cries of racism, planting evidence, and white-hate at every street corner, at every news station, and from every Ithacite&rsquo;s mouth. <br>
<br>
It is a fact that blacks are more violent then whites. They also commit more &#147;hate crimes&#148;, despite what is commonly believed. The media propagates this behavior by rejoicing in reports of white-on-black violence and sweeping under the rug the rampant black-on-white violence. Everyone agrees that crime is a pressing issue, yet nobody will take the initiative to stop it. <br>
<br>
Until the black community accepts that a problem exists and the media reports crime in an honest way, we will be left walking the streets being told by the authorities that tiny Asian girls and thuggish black males should be treated with equal suspicion. Just remember to be safe and carry your Smith &amp; Wesson.

<div class="title">Cornell Censorship</div>
<p><em>Joseph J. Sabia, FrontPageMagazine.com, Sept. 23</em></p>
<p>For the third time in three years, the Cornell University administration is on the warpath, threatening to sanction the campus&rsquo; conservative newspaper, <em>The Cornell American</em>. Last week, </font><a href="https://www.cornellamerican.com/main/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=78"><font size="3" color="#0000ff"><em>The American</font></em></a><font size="3"> published a news story describing the empirical link between race and crime, causing absolute hysteria among leftists on campus. The piece was largely based on Jared Taylor&rsquo;s 1999 book, <em>The Color of Crime</em>, as well as crime-related observations by African-American economist </font><a href="https://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/williams081899.asp"><font size="3">Walter Williams</font></a><font size="3">. Unable to handle both facts and opinions with which they disagree, leftist students and administrators appear to be plotting to censor the newspaper. Again. </p>
<p>In an all too familiar refrain, the Cornell administration has charged The American with creating a hostile learning environment for Black students. The Vice Provost for Diversity, Africana Studies Professor Robert Harris, wrote a letter to the Cornell Daily Sun stating, in part, that <em>The American</em> article had &#147;crossed the line&#148;: </p>
<p>As Cornell prepares to celebrate the 5th Anniversary of its Statement on Diversity and Inclusion, Open Doors, Open Hearts and Open Minds, <em>The Cornell American</em> has once more crossed the line with a scurrilous story that violates the call for &#147;constructive engagement without degrading, abusing, harassing or silencing others.&#148;&hellip;Hasty, erroneous, and sweeping generalizations like [<em>American</em> writer Chris] Menzel&rsquo;s serve more to incite bigotry than to solve the problem.</p>
