<div align="left"><i>Ian Jobling, American Renaissance, Oct.-Nov. 2003</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p><i>American 
                    Renaissance</i> has always expressed anguished bewilderment 
                    at whites&rsquo; lack of a sense of their own interests. All 
                    other races promote their own interests unapologetically, 
                    and have prominent, well-funded lobbying organizations. There 
                    are no such organizations for whites, mainly because whites 
                    themselves oppose their establishment. The few small pro-white 
                    organizations that do exist are usually labeled &#147;hate 
                    groups.&#148; </font></p>
                  <p>At the same time, whites hand 
                    out billions of dollars every year in social services to non-whites, 
                    and pass affirmative action legislation to help them compete 
                    against whites for jobs and education. Whites promote mass 
                    Third-World immigration, and white politicians try to make 
                    immigration easier and more attractive. Whites willingly&mdash;even 
                    eagerly, it seems&mdash;surrender whole neighborhoods to immigrants. 
                    In short, whites consider it praiseworthy to work in the interests 
                    of other races, but disreputable to work in their own.</font></p>
                  <p>There are several theories proposed 
                    to explain this. One, argued by Kevin MacDonald, is that Jews 
                    have had a corrosive effect on white group identity. Jews, 
                    he argues, have promoted intellectual systems, such as Freudianism, 
                    Marxism, and deconstruction that pathologize expressions of 
                    white group identity, such as Christianity, patriotism, and 
                    traditional family life. He writes that Jews have made movies 
                    and television programs that ridicule Christianity and patriotism, 
                    and have been among the most powerful advocates of immigration 
                    and liberalization in America. They support pro-minority activism 
                    of all kinds. Jews, according to this theory, have helped 
                    equate any expression of white self-interest with &#147;fascism.&#148;</font></p>

                  <p>Another explanation of the white 
                    race&rsquo;s lack of a sense of its interests is Jared Taylor&rsquo;s 
                    theory about white altruism, which he outlined in his <i>American 
                    Renaissance </i>article, &#147;The Ways of Our People&#148; 
                    (Sept. and Oct. 1996). Mr. Taylor believes whites have a unique 
                    sense of reciprocity and an inclination to acknowledge the 
                    points of view and the interests of other people. He cites 
                    the humane treatment of enemy soldiers and rules of sportsmanship 
                    that value generosity towards competitors more highly than 
                    beating them. </font></p>
                  <p>Mr. Taylor argues that the distinguishing 
                    and desirable features of Western civilization are based on 
                    this deep sense of reciprocity. The elimination of hereditary 
                    class status gives everyone an equal chance. Democracy is 
                    the belief that the other person&rsquo;s political preferences 
                    ought to count as much as one&rsquo;s own. Freedom of expression 
                    requires the protection of opposing viewpoints. Thus, the 
                    generosity whites show towards other races is an extension 
                    of this inherent generosity.</font></p>
                  <p>While Prof. MacDonald&rsquo;s 
                    and Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s theories may go part of the way in explaining 
                    white behavior, they do not fully account for it. Even if 
                    Prof. MacDonald&rsquo;s theories about Jewish motives are correct, 
                    as he himself acknowledges, Jews are only a small percentage 
                    of the population of white nations, and could not have corroded 
                    white identity without the consent of whites. It was gentile 
                    presidents and mostly gentile politicians who passed the immigration 
                    reform laws Jews (and others) advocated. Gentiles happily 
                    buy tickets to anti-white movies. Prof. MacDonald does not 
                    explain why whites consent to their destruction. Mr. Taylor 
                    is certainly right to link this consent to altruism, but his 
                    account is incomplete because he overlooks one of the primary 
                    motives for this behavior.</font></p>
                  <p>In order to understand whites, 
                    one must recognize that much of their apparently altruistic 
                    behavior is actually a form of egoistic competition. What 
                    I will call &#147;competitive altruism&#148; is one of the 
                    key forces that shape white societies. This form of competition 
                    emerges because altruism is linked to social status. People 
                    who act altruistically gain the trust and respect of others, 
                    which tends to increase their prestige and wealth. It follows 
                    that those who convince others they are altruistic reap greater 
                    status rewards than those who do not. </font></p>

                  <p>One of the primary forms of 
                    competitive altruism in contemporary white society is racial 
                    altruism. Expressing benevolence for non-whites has become 
                    a key to success in white societies. It is virtually impossible 
                    to achieve high status without overt expressions of concern 
                    and benevolence for non-whites, and such expressions are particularly 
                    common because they can be made <i>at no personal cost</i>. 
                    The racial altruism high-status Americans promote does have 
                    a very high cost, but one that is, in the near-term, borne 
                    almost exclusively by low-status whites. </font></p>
                  <p>From an evolutionary point of 
                    view, altruism can be explained on the assumption that genes 
                    build organisms to make more copies of these genes. Altruism 
                    toward family members aids the survival and reproduction of 
                    people who share one&rsquo;s own genes; hence, genes succeed 
                    in their goal of propagating themselves when people are generous 
                    to their close kin. Altruism that is reciprocated also benefits 
                    the altruist. It leads to the exchange of favors and goods, 
                    and those who practice it generally have a better chance of 
                    survival than those who do not.</font></p>
                  <p>However, some altruistic behavior 
                    is harder to explain. Many acts of kindness or generosity 
                    have little chance of being reciprocated. Why do people give 
                    to charity and work in soup kitchens? Why do they return lost 
                    wallets and rescue strangers from burning buildings?</font></p>
                  <p>Several explanations have been 
                    proposed, but the one most relevant here is the theory of 
                    altruism as reputation-building. Whom would you choose as 
                    a business partner: someone who returned a lost wallet, or 
                    someone who kept it? Most people prefer the former because 
                    returning a wallet shows honesty and concern for others. Altruism 
                    makes a person more sought after in economic and personal 
                    relationships, so a reputation for altruism can bring social 
                    prestige. Indeed, empirical work by J. Philippe Rushton shows 
                    that those who show high levels of altruism tend to do better 
                    economically than those who are selfish.</font></p>

                  <p>The psychologist Gilbert Roberts 
                    takes this theory one step further. If altruism improves one&rsquo;s 
                    reputation, there is every reason to believe it will become 
                    competitive. People will want to show themselves to be more 
                    altruistic than others in order to gain friends and prestige. 
                    Furthermore, inasmuch as high social status is a key aspect 
                    of male sexual attractiveness, Prof. Roberts believes displays 
                    of altruism are some of the things men do to make themselves 
                    more sexually attractive.</font></p>
                  <p>These theories treat altruism 
                    as an instinct. There is no reason, therefore, to expect people 
                    to be conscious of why they behave generously. They simply 
                    enjoy acting altruistically, and they like altruists. Theories 
                    about altruism do not require that people understand their 
                    own motives any better than a hen understand why she sits 
                    on her eggs.</font></p>
                  <p>If the competitive altruism 
                    hypothesis is correct, we would expect people to engage in 
                    public displays of altruism. We would expect competitive altruists 
                    to be highly censorious: they should be eager to point out 
                    the selfishness of others in order to shine by comparison. 
                    We would also expect to see evidence of the relationship between 
                    altruistic behavior, social status, and economic gain.</font></p>
                  <p>Competitive altruism often takes 
                    beneficial forms. If a politician is compelled by competitive 
                    altruism to act in the best interests of a group he represents, 
                    and to use government money in the group&rsquo;s interest, 
                    he will win more favor among voters than a less altruistic 
                    competitor. However, it is also possible for competitive altruism 
                    to hurt the group. Since competitive altruists are striving 
                    for their own personal ends rather than those of the group, 
                    their apparently altruistic actions can easily damage the 
                    group&rsquo;s interests.</font></p>

                  <p>Any attempt to prove that one 
                    person is more altruistic or generous than another is likely 
                    to get lost in intangibles, because altruism is hard to define 
                    and pin down. Philanthropy, however, is a relatively definite 
                    and easily measured type of altruism, and has been thoroughly 
                    studied. The authors of these studies do not write explicitly 
                    about competitive altruism, but it is obvious that competition 
                    is one of the basic motivations of philanthropic giving.</font></p>
                  <p>Francie Ostrower, who has interviewed 
                    many philanthropists and is the author of <i>Why the Wealthy 
                    Give</i>, reports that one of the principal motives of philanthropy 
                    is to gain social status. By giving money to museums, universities, 
                    and other charities, American elites carve out an exclusive 
                    social world for themselves. Philanthropy is at once a sign 
                    of elite status and a way of making connections to enhance 
                    that status. One philanthropist described the rewards: &#147;That&rsquo;s 
                    pretty straightforward &hellip; . Social profile. A new forum 
                    for making social connections.&#148; Another said, &#147;One 
                    gets into philanthropic efforts or involvements &hellip; because 
                    you like and enjoy the caliber of the people you&rsquo;re doing 
                    this with.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p>The competitive nature of altruism 
                    is clear: &#147;If you move to [Xville] and you want to be 
                    accepted by the OK people, you break your back to get on the 
                    board of the museum &hellip; . The entr&eacute;es leading off 
                    that board are not to be believed&hellip; . You cannot imagine 
                    the vying that goes on to get onto that board.&#148; Board 
                    memberships are a site of competition between different elite 
                    groups. Prof. Ostrower notes that there is often a conflict 
                    between the &#147;old guard,&#148; which sees itself as the 
                    &#147;true guardians&#148; of the organization, and the &#147;new 
                    rich,&#148; who try to eclipse the prestige of the older money 
                    by making larger donations. The old guard defends itself as 
                    the board&rsquo;s true guardians by stressing the purity of 
                    its altruism as opposed to the mercenary striving of the new 
                    rich. &#147;One social elite donor, for instance, distanced 
                    herself from the &lsquo;new rich,&rsquo; whom she portrayed 
                    as giving for status, implying that she herself did not.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p>Just as altruism raises status, 
                    its absence lowers it. Most of the philanthropists whom Prof. 
                    Ostrower interviewed agreed that &#147;for wealthier members 
                    of our society, philanthropy is not a matter of personal choice, 
                    but is an obligation.&#148; One donor said that when he sees 
                    wealthy people who contribute little, &#147;it gives me a 
                    real clue about them as people &hellip; .&#148; Another said 
                    that wealthy people who did not give were &#147;looked upon 
                    with disdain, disfavor and [were] highly criticized.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p>This type of competitive altruism 
                    is clearly one of the basic features of Western culture and 
                    is part of the Christian ethic, which exhorts Christians to 
                    altruism. </font></p>
                  <p>While the Protestants who founded 
                    America sanctified the accumulation of wealth, this was to 
                    be balanced by charitable giving. The Puritan leader John 
                    Winthrop believed God did not make one man richer than others 
                    for his own sake, &#147;but for the glory of his creator and 
                    the common good of the creature man.&#148; Jonathan Edwards 
                    believed charity was at the center of a Christian life. &#147;Where,&#148; 
                    he asked, &#147;have we any command in the Bible laid down 
                    in stronger terms, and in a more peremptory urgent manner 
                    than the command of giving to the poor?&#148; William Penn 
                    ordained to his fellow Quakers &#147;Obedience to Superiors, 
                    Love to Equals, &hellip; Help and Countenance to Inferiors.&#148; 
                    For Penn, money beyond what was needed to assure one&rsquo;s 
                    own comfort should be given to orphans, widows, and the hungry.</font></p>

                  <p>The 19th century saw an exuberant 
                    proliferation of charitable organizations. The 1830s, for 
                    example, were the age of the &#147;Benevolent Empire&#148; 
                    of Protestant religious societies that distributed Bibles 
                    and religious tracts, promoted missionary work, and succored 
                    the indigent. This tradition continued in the 20th century, 
                    and was typified by Andrew Carnegie. He wrote about &#147;surplus 
                    revenues which come to [the rich man] simply as trust funds 
                    &hellip; which he is called upon to administer in the manner 
                    which, in his judgment, is best calculated to produce the 
                    most beneficial results for the community.&#148; Today&rsquo;s 
                    wealthiest foundations were established in the names of 20th 
                    century magnate-philanthropists: Ford Foundation, Rockefeller 
                    Foundation, W. K. Kellogg Foundation, Pew Memorial Trust, 
                    etc.</font></p>
                  <p>There is no doubt that competitive 
                    altruism played a role in this. Protestantism&rsquo;s most 
                    famous theorist, the sociologist Max Weber, emphasized the 
                    connection between religious involvement and economic success. 
                    After giving many examples of the association between religious 
                    observance and business success in America, Weber concluded 
                    that throughout American history &#147;sect membership meant 
                    a certificate of moral qualification and especially of business 
                    morals for the individual.&#148; Climbing within the church 
                    through conformity to its principles went hand in hand with 
                    success in the business world. Philanthropic giving was important 
                    in both worlds, and one&rsquo;s status increased with one&rsquo;s 
                    generosity. </font></p>
                  <p>The current prevalence of racial 
                    altruism in elite white culture is due to a shift in the beneficiaries 
                    of competitive altruism. In the 19th century, people climbed 
                    the social ladder by giving to charities that distributed 
                    Bibles to orphans and sent missionaries to Africa. Today, 
                    elite commitment to specifically Christian philanthropy has 
                    been replaced by competition among whites who make donations 
                    to the United Negro College Fund or programs to promote diversity 
                    in higher education. </font></p>
                  <p>The direction of competitive 
                    altruism changed as a result of the power struggle that emerged 
                    in the 1960s and &lsquo;70s between two segments of the American 
                    elite and gave rise to what became known as the liberal &#147;New 
                    Class,&#148; primarily employed in the public sector, and 
                    the business community. The New Class gained power by convincing 
                    the public its liberalism was a necessary antidote to the 
                    &#147;racism&#148; and selfishness of the &#147;organization 
                    men&#148; in the business world. Businessmen responded by 
                    trying to prove that the plight of minorities was important 
                    to them too, and started donating to liberal charities. Eventually 
                    they discovered that racial altruism was good business: the 
                    elite patronized businesses that helped minorities. Businesses 
                    therefore compete with each other to prove themselves the 
                    most racially altruistic. A concern for the interests of whites 
                    or even for their survival as a group is now the worst sort 
                    of bad taste.</font></p>
                  <p>The ideology of the current 
                    ruling class had its origins in the New Left movement of the 
                    1960s, of which student radicalism was a part. While the old 
                    left had worked mainly for the well-being of white workers, 
                    the New Left was more concerned with minorities, the Third 
                    World, women, and the environment. In yoking these together, 
                    the New Left brought into being what we call &#147;liberalism.&#148;</font>

                  <p>Although predominantly white 
                    and Jewish, New Leftists romanticized blacks and Third-World 
                    peasants who, they believed, possessed an authentic &#147;humanism&#148; 
                    that was, in the words of student leader Tom Hayden, &#147;immune 
                    to the ravages of competitive society.&#148; They argued that 
                    the United States was dominated by an exploitative, incipiently 
                    aristocratic class of white Protestants that was racist, imperialist, 
                    and McCarthyite. As the New Left ideologue Susan Sontag put 
                    it in 1967: </font></p>
                  <p>&#147;The white race is the 
                    cancer of human history. It is the white race and it alone&mdash;its 
                    ideologies and inventions&mdash;which eradicates autonomous 
                    civilizations wherever it spreads, which has upset the ecological 
                    balance of the planet, which now threatens the very existence 
                    of life itself.&#148; According to Mr. Hayden&rsquo;s 1962 
                    &#147;Port Huron Statement,&#148; the manifesto of this movement, 
                    the radicals espoused &#147;generosity of a kind that imprints 
                    one&rsquo;s unique individual qualities in the relation to 
                    other men, and to all human activity.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p>What better objects of generosity 
                    than those groups who were furthest from the mainstream: non-whites, 
                    homosexuals, criminals, and deviates of all kinds? Just as 
                    Jesus demonstrated his purity by consorting with prostitutes 
                    and publicans, the New Left would outcompete all others in 
                    altruism by claiming, at any rate, to care the most about 
                    people for whom the moneyed classes appeared to care the least.</font></p>
                  <p>Capitalism was, of course, the 
                    very antithesis of generosity, and the New Left initiated 
                    the anti-corporate campaign that has become a permanent feature 
                    of the political landscape. They founded groups like Students 
                    for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Institute for Policy Studies, 
                    the Economic Research and Action Project, the Association 
                    of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), and the 
                    Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility. They organized 
                    strikes and boycotts against companies, often on the grounds 
                    that they discriminated against non-whites. They worked together 
                    with minority groups to pressure banks and corporations to 
                    hire minorities and stop doing business with South Africa. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p>These campaigns had a mixed 
                    record in changing corporate practices, but were overwhelmingly 
                    successful in changing public opinion, particularly among 
                    the young. During the &lsquo;60s and &lsquo;70s, the New Left 
                    completely won the altruism game, and convinced the public 
                    of its moral superiority to business. A poll of college students 
                    in 1969 found that 94 percent believed business was &#147;too 
                    profit-blinded and not concerned with public welfare.&#148; 
                    Interest in a business career plummeted; in 1966, only seven 
                    percent of Princeton seniors said they planned immediate employment 
                    in business. As an article in <i>Fortune</i> found, &#147;The 
                    prejudice against business is undeniable, and permeates the 
                    country&rsquo;s highest-ranking colleges.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p>The theory of competitive altruism 
                    predicts that anyone who manages to prove himself more altruistic 
                    than others will rise in status, and that is precisely what 
                    happened to the New Left. Many of the student radicals, as 
                    well as moderates who sided with them, began to form a new 
                    type of elite&mdash;it was conservative critics who called 
                    it the &#147;New Class&#148;&mdash;which prospered in professions 
                    unrelated to, and often hostile to, business. According to 
                    Irving Kristol, one of this class&rsquo;s major theorists, 
                    the New Class consisted of &#147;scientists, teachers and 
                    educational administrators, journalists, and others in the 
                    communication industries, psychologists, social workers, those 
                    lawyers and doctors who make their careers in the expanding 
                    public sector, city planners, the staffs of the larger foundations, 
                    the upper level of the government bureaucracy, and so on.&#148; 
                    They became the &#147;experts&#148; whose opinions are constantly

                  <p>As they grew older they consolidated 
                    their gains: In the 1970s Mr. Kristol wrote, &#147;In any 
                    naked contest with the &lsquo;new class,&rsquo; business is 
                    the certain loser.&#148; The emergence and influence of this 
                    class can be quantified in American voting patterns: in the 
                    1972 presidential election, for the first time, a greater 
                    percentage of the college-educated voted for the Democrats 
                    than did the non-college-educated. As recently as the 2000 
                    presidential election, highly educated professionals were 
                    still more likely to vote for the left than was the rest of 
                    the population.</font></p>
                  <p>Although the New Class defined 
                    itself in opposition to establishment Protestantism, the conservative 
                    critic Michael Novak recognized what they had in common::</font></p>
                  <p>&#147;The New Class covers its 
                    political campaigns &hellip; with an aura of morality so thick 
                    it would make the righteous Anglo-Saxons of a century ago 
                    envious. Because two of its chief causes&mdash;civil rights 
                    (including poverty) and resistance to the Indochinese war&mdash;are 
                    morally sound, it has been able to conceal its own lust for 
                    power and its own class interests, at least from itself.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p>While their form of expression 
                    had changed, the basic traits of the race persisted. The New 
                    Class had merely found a new way to play the competitive altruism 
                    game that has always dominated American life: the only difference 
                    was that now blacks and Vietnamese peasants, rather than widows 
                    and orphans, were the pawns in the competition for elite status. 
                    As Communism crumbled, the people who would once have claimed 
                    to champion the proletariat switched to non-whites, homosexuals, 
                    and immigrants. The competitive impulse was the same, and 
                    the more forceful and public their demonstrations of benevolence, 
                    the greater their claim to superiority. </font></p>
                  <p>The overwhelming success of 
                    New Class activism led to steep increases in welfare spending, 
                    public sector employment, taxation of the wealthy, environment 
                    and worker protection, and to the civil rights legislation 
                    of the 1960s. Groups expressing New Class opinions, like the 
                    NAACP, the ACLU, the National Organization of Women, and Greenpeace, 
                    raised millions of dollars by appealing to the fashionable 
                    new forms of altruism. Moreover, liberal groups have garnered 
                    more, and more positive, publicity than business or conservative 
                    groups. Virtually all media references to liberal citizens&rsquo; 
                    groups have a positive or neutral spin, whereas references 
                    to corporations or conservatives generally have a negative 
                    spin. </font></p>
                  <p>This is because media operators 
                    are, almost without exception, members of the New Class, and 
                    promote its views of morality and altruism. They soft-peddle 
                    news about black or Hispanic crime, Mexican and other non-white 
                    chauvinism, and the depredations of immigrants, while trumpeting 
                    any detectable misbehavior by whites, heterosexuals, or corporate 
                    executives.</font></p>
                  <p>In this hostile environment, 
                    businesses had to find a way to regain credibility. They started 
                    backing New Class causes to show they were &#147;socially 
                    responsible&#148; and &#147;good corporate citizens.&#148; 
                    As one Wall Street investor put it: &#147;Corporations are 
                    required to pay for the privilege of existing as corporations.&#148; 
                    As always in competitive altruism, the key was to appear to 
                    be unselfish, and the result has been an increase in corporate 
                    philanthropy. Between 1966 and 1996, total corporate contributions 
                    to philanthropic causes increased from $790 million to $8.5 
                    billion, which represented a more than two-fold increase in 
                    real terms. The amount of total pre-tax income contributed 
                    increased by 39 percent. There has also been a significant 
                    and increasing leftward bias to these contributions. The Capital 
                    Research Center has shown that in 1997 corporations gave more 
                    than four times as much money to liberal groups as to conservative 
                    ones. Minority activist groups are among the top beneficiaries 
                    of corporate largesse. In 1997, the National Urban League 
                    was the leading recipient of corporate charity, and the NAACP, 
                    the National Council of La Raza, and the National Council 
                    of Negro Women were in the top 40.</font></p>

                  <p>Although corporate contributions 
                    reduce profits and shareholder value, studies that examine 
                    the link between corporate &#147;social responsibility&#148; 
                    and profit show a positive relationship. Millions of pious 
                    Americans are willing to buy the products of companies that 
                    support minority causes. One survey found that if price and 
                    quality were the same, 76 percent of Americans would switch 
                    to a brand or retail store associated with a liberal cause. 
                    In short, altruism pays.</font></p>
                  <p>Consequently, many well-known 
                    companies trumpet their &#147;commitment to diversity,&#148; 
                    hire diversity consultants, require &#147;sensitivity training,&#148; 
                    practice open racial preferences for non-whites, and spend 
                    lavishly at minority job fairs. They are delighted to be chosen 
                    by minority magazines as one of the &#147;ten best companies 
                    for Hispanics&#148;&mdash;or blacks or Asians or women or homosexuals. 
                    It apparently occurs to no one that such companies might be 
                    inhospitable to whites or men. Nor do white consumers punish 
                    companies that boast about preferential treatment for non-whites.</font></p>
                  <p>Corporate philanthropy, racial 
                    or otherwise, buys status for the boss. Executives of smaller 
                    businesses gain important contacts with top industry leaders 
                    by cooperating with them on philanthropic initiatives. Lobbyists 
                    representing philanthropic corporations have an easy time 
                    getting the ear of government. A 1994 article in <i>The Chronicle 
                    of Philanthropy</i> noted that in many communities &#147;involvement 
                    with charity is practically a prerequisite to becoming a powerful 
                    figure in the business life of the city.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p>As the competitive altruism 
                    theory would predict, highly charitable corporations like 
                    Bell Atlantic are decidedly sniffy about less charitable competitors, 
                    and eager to expose their philanthropic inferiority. &#147;Corporate 
                    America should be giving 2.5 percent of income,&#148; the 
                    president of the Bell Atlantic Foundation has said. &#147;I 
                    think the nonprofit community should do a major public relations 
                    campaign exposing how little corporations are giving as a 
                    percent of pretax income.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p>This kind of pressure makes 
                    a difference. For years, Microsoft chairman William Gates 
                    refused to give away his billions&mdash;and was roundly criticized 
                    for tight-fistedness. As well-known philanthropist Alberto 
                    Vilar complains, he did not give &#147;away one damn penny 
                    until he was worth $80 billion.&#148; He eventually established 
                    the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which now has $24 billion 
                    in assets. Predictably, the richest man in the world has poured 
                    money into the most futile and therefore the most admired 
                    causes: eliminating the racial gap in academic achievement 
                    and eradicating AIDS in Africa. Just as predictably, now that 
                    Mrs. Gates is in charge of giving away about $1 billion a 
                    year, she has made a great many new friends. The happy, non-whites 
                    faces that dominate the Gates Foundation.org web page no doubt 
                    add to her prestige.</font></p>

                  <p>The egoistic aspect of philanthropy 
                    and altruism helps explain why the small organizations that 
                    promote white interests receive little support. There is no 
                    public approval for supporters of white causes; in fact there 
                    is active disapproval as contributors to David Duke&rsquo;s 
                    political campaigns have discovered. Contributor lists are, 
                    by law, public documents, and newspapers have published the 
                    names and addresses of Duke supporters. Some were harassed 
                    or suffered professionally. Needless to say, newspapers do 
                    not publish the names of people who give money to Al Sharpton 
                    or Cruz Bustamante. Donations to pro-white organizations do 
                    not raise social status; they lower it. They are therefore 
                    a sincere expression of support rather than a tool for status-seeking 
                    or social climbing.</font></p>
                  <p>A combination of Christian moralizing, 
                    competitive altruism, and what appears to be a uniquely white 
                    impulse to abandon healthy group loyalties can result in acts 
                    of racial altruism that are simply astounding. Reginald Denny 
                    became famous for cozying up to the thugs who nearly beat 
                    him to death at the start of the Los Angeles riots in 1992. 
                    The parents of Amy Biehl, who was murdered by black South 
                    Africans because she was white, publicly embraced her killers 
                    and gave them jobs at the foundation they set up to honor 
                    their daughter (see next article). These acts won great admiration 
                    among liberals. </font></p>
                  <p>It is, of course, very hard 
                    to think of examples of non-whites ever behaving this way, 
                    in any period of history. Any ordinary non-white who openly 
                    forgave and embraced a racial antagonist would be treated 
                    as a fool or a traitor by his co-racialists.</font></p>
                  <p>The charity of American blacks, 
                    for example, is almost always directed to black causes. As 
                    Emmett D. Carson, who has written extensively on black charity, 
                    notes, &#147;Our [black] giving was always centered around 
                    African-American interests.&#148; Wealthy blacks like William 
                    Cosby, Oprah Winfrey, Willie E. Gary, and the singer Brandy, 
                    donate to historically black colleges and scholarships for 
                    black students. The spirit of black philanthropy is summed 
                    up in the name of a panel at the 2003 Black North Carolina 
                    Conference: &#147;Black Philanthropy: Are African-Americans 
                    Doing Enough to Support Each Other?&#148; The question of 
                    non-black causes does not even arise.</font></p>

                  <p>The competitive struggle within 
                    the American elite to appear virtuous now means displays of 
                    racial altruism are an obligatory part of social climbing. 
                    David Brooks describes the culture of contemporary affluence 
                    in <i>Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How it Got 
                    There</i>. The bookstores in the chic locales where the New 
                    Class rich gather are all the same: &#147;you can&rsquo;t get 
                    the <i>New Republic</i> or anything to its right,&#148; but 
                    you are guaranteed to find a large and prominently displayed 
                    &#147;ethnic studies&#148; section, which you can sample while 
                    listening to &#147;World Music.&#148; </font></p>
                  <p>The folk art of &#147;colonial 
                    victims&#148; is the preferred d&eacute;cor of the homes of 
                    social strivers:</font></p>
                  <p>&#147;In fact, if you tour a 
                    super-sophisticated home, you will see an odd m&eacute;lange 
                    of artifacts that have nothing in common except for the shared 
                    victimization of their creators. An African mask will sit 
                    next to an Incan statue atop a tablecloth fashioned from Samoan, 
                    Brazilian, Moroccan, or Tibetan cloth.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p>Mr. Brooks argues that &lsquo;60s 
                    radicalism has become an integral part of the business world. 
                    &#147;Business is chic&#148; among wealthy bobos, but only 
                    because every business now portrays itself as &#147;a social 
                    movement.&#148; &#147;Cause capitalism&#148; and &#147;liberation 
                    marketing&#148; are ubiquitous: in the bobo supermarket, you 
                    can &#147;save the rainforest, ease global warming, nurture 
                    Native American values, support family farms, spread world 
                    peace, and reduce income inequality&#148; just by buying food. 
                    Successful businessmen wear &#147;Days of Rage&#148; T-shirts 
                    while they exercise, thereby celebrating a 1969 spree of violence

                  <p>Mr. Brooks recognizes that romanticizing 
                    colonial victims is an integral part of a kind of &#147;one-downmanship&#148; 
                    status game. Celebrating the downtrodden is a way of showing 
                    that one is &#147;compassionate&#148; and less materialistic 
                    than one&rsquo;s fellows.</font></p>
                  <p>For Mr. Brooks, the prototypical 
                    bobo paradise is Burlington, Vermont, which he describes in 
                    detail. There you will find plenty of pro-minority sentimentality 
                    but few minorities. In fact, Burlington is 95 percent white, 
                    with blacks and Hispanics each at less than one percent of 
                    the population. Burlington confirms one of the great laws 
                    of American race relations: the amount of sympathy whites 
                    feel for minorities is in inverse proportion to their experience 
                    with them. </font></p>
                  <p>And this, of course, is why 
                    the pro-minority component of competitive altruism is so attractive: 
                    It is easy to reap the benefits while others pay the costs. 
                    Hillary Clinton oozes love for blacks and Mexicans because 
                    she does not live among them. Neither her daughter nor anyone 
                    she knows ever had to go to school with them. When Edward 
                    Kennedy goes to the beach at Hyannisport his afternoon will 
                    not be spoiled by a boatload of scruffy Haitians. Astonishingly, 
                    what has become the cornerstone of elite morality&mdash;on-tap 
                    enthusiasm for diversity and integration&mdash;need be nothing 
                    more than pure lip service. The hypocrisies run so deep that, 
                    as Joseph Sobran has pointed out, in their mating and migratory 
                    habits, liberals are indistinguishable from members of the 
                    Klan. </font></p>
                  <p>Pro-minority altruism is like 
                    that equally vital ingredient of superior morality, &#147;compassion.&#148; 
                    Conveniently for liberals, &#147;compassion&#148; requires 
                    no personal sacrifice, but consists in braying about all the 
                    generous things government should be doing&mdash;with other 
                    people&rsquo;s money&mdash;for the downtrodden. </font></p>
                  <p>At the same time, part of the 
                    competition to appear superior involves the search for foils 
                    and inferiors. Hence the exuberant media campaigns against 
                    anyone like Patrick Buchanan, Trent Lott, John Rocker, David 
                    Duke, or Jesse Helms. Hence the attempts to withdraw tenure 
                    from academics like Philippe Rushton, Michael Levin, and Linda 
                    Gottfredson who study racial differences. Hence the sanctions 
                    against students who violate campus &#147;speech codes.&#148; 
                    Once again, demonstrations of superiority have no cost. The 
                    louder one yells about John Rocker or Trent Lott, the more 
                    virtuous one appears, and the people who yell the loudest 
                    are under no more pressure to live in black neighborhoods 
                    than the ones who do not yell at all.</font></p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Of course, there is a cost to 
                    racial altruism, though it is almost never borne directly 
                    by the people who practice it most publicly. The Supreme Court 
                    justices who ordered racial integration of schools in 1954 
                    never suffered from their ruling, nor is it likely their families 
                    did either. It was working- and middle-class whites, who shared 
                    little of the altruistic zeal of the justices, whose schools 
                    were wrecked. The same is true of every aspect of the &#147;civil 
                    rights&#148; revolution. The elites who insist on altruism 
                    have enough money to buy at least temporary reprieve from 
                    the need actually to practice it. The current fad of fawning 
                    over non-white immigrants works the same way. Rich boosters 
                    get cheap labor and docile nannies. The rest of us get crime, 
                    bad schools, and neighborhoods where we are a despised minority.</font></p>

                  <p>In the long term, of course, 
                    the costs of racial altruism will catch up even with the elites, 
                    one way or another. White politicians who pander to Hispanics 
                    will be badly disappointed, as Congressman Robert Dornan of 
                    California discovered. He represented part of Orange County 
                    for 18 years, as it gradually became more and more Hispanic. 
                    In 1995 he claimed to an interviewer that he was not at all 
                    bothered by this change: &#147;I want to say America stays 
                    a nation of immigrants. And if we lose our Northern European 
                    stock&mdash;your coloring and mine, blue eyes and fair hair&mdash;tough!&#148;</font></p>
                  <p>The very next year, Hispanics 
                    voted in Loretta Sanchez, the 36-year-old daughter of immigrants, 
                    who kept telling voters how Mexican she was. This is precisely 
                    what Mr. Dornan&rsquo;s cheerful view of immigration should 
                    have prepared him for, but did he concede defeat gracefully? 
                    No. He accused Miss Sanchez&rsquo;s supporters of vote fraud, 
                    demanded recounts, and was a thoroughly bad sport about it 
                    all. Suddenly, racial altruism had a cost, and he screamed 
                    like a stuck pig.</font></p>
                  <p>For most white elites, justice 
                    will not be quite so swift or poetic. As the tide of color 
                    rises, they will have to spend more money to stay beyond its 
                    reach. Some will catch themselves wondering if racial preferences 
                    didn&rsquo;t keep little Johnny out of Harvard. Others will 
                    have a moment of pique when the classical music station switches 
                    to salsa. A few will even be mugged or murdered when they 
                    take the wrong freeway exit, and actually meet some of the 
                    people they claim to love. Our rulers and opinion-makers will 
                    have occasional brushes with the corruption, squalor, and 
                    incompetence of Third-World America, but will use their money 
                    to carve little oases of Western Civilization out of the wreckage&mdash;at 
                    least for a while.</font></p>
                  <p>Eventually, though, even they 
                    will see the obvious: that the non-whites racial altruists 
                    bring to power in America will not fritter away their gains 
                    in displays of moral superiority the way we do. An America 
                    run by non-whites will be a very different place; competitive 
                    racial altruism is not a game non-whites play. Ordinary Americans 
                    discovered this long ago, and must force their rulers to abandon 
                    habits and vanities that will eventually destroy us all. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>So, what we need to do is trigger the reverse by making whites feel guilty for 1) not helping their own people and 2) wasting resources on non-whites. Persuasion is one way to do this. Citing examples of beleagured whites is another. Citing examples of ungrateful minorities is yet another. The photos of tsunami victims with Osama bin Laden T-shirts, you&rsquo;d think, would cool our enthusiasm, but too many whites still don&rsquo;t get it. Ostracizing whites who subsidize non-whites   &mdash;  - and don&rsquo;t give to their own community   &mdash;  - should be encouraged. One limitation here is the lack of white causes to donate to. AR itself is wise to feature a photo of a young girl and the question, &#8220;do you want your children to be minorities?&#8221;</p></font><p>Posted

I believe the guy was just looking at the car but since he was in a big crowd of whites he must have got brave and said what&rsquo;s it to ya? or something lame like that.

  <font size="3"><p><br>
The deceptive morality of what Mr. Jobling insightfully calls &#8220;the New Class,&#8221; has a design feature that makes it unusually potent: Its tenets depend on appearance, not substance. In this corkscrew reality, if something seems good and just, it is. If something seems evil, it is. If this initial perception of good or evil is underwritten by the correct sources, then the question is solved; no further need for investigation or study. After all, questions would indicate doubt, doubt would indicate weakness, and corruption, and then &#8220;enemy of the people&#8221; treason, etc.</p>
<p>These &#8220;correct&#8221; sources are the dogmatic elite, the self-appointed activist priesthood that applies praise or opprobrium wherever it sees fit. This con-man conceit was stumbled upon by the early Christian church, then perfected by the Euro-American Jewish Left, and it is awesome lemming bait. Everyone wants to feel noble, moral, righteous; and everyone, way down deep, wants to feel they are all those things to a greater degree than the next guy. The illusion of moral superiority has been the irresistable fuel in establishing all the Left&rsquo;s blood-drenched agendas; the useful idiots never awaken from their stupor until it&rsquo;s too late, and they&rsquo;re safely, snugly, tucked into their own little gulag cubby holes. Or dead.</p>
<p>It would take a real, widespread crisis to shake white people out of this enchantment. And a lot of them would have to die. White people haven&rsquo;t died in droves or been enslaved in large numbers for quite some time. In the days when these things could and did happen with some frequency, there was little worry about whether our enemies were comfortable, or enjoying their full due process. In those days white people smote their enemies hip and thigh, and didn&rsquo;t lose a wink of sleep over it.</p>

Great article Dr. Jobling,</p>
<p>The three above concluding paragraphs above seriously gave me some pause for thought. The white altruists may find &ldquo;ordinary Americans&rdquo; not all that forgiving in the decades to come. What is fashionable today, might just be the Mark of Cain tomorrow. As the average &ldquo;ordinary American&rdquo; is the villain and victim of all that these racial tea and crumpet-traitors have done, so too are these people going to make up the group that they will be looking to for support and help when the harsh realities of their Third World Paradise, start to hit home. Case in point, Adolf Hillary&rsquo;s sudden conversion to anti-immigration politics. While I see this as a welcome development, it is not going to get me to vote for this &ldquo;Bobo&rdquo; Multi Cultist. In other words, Mrs. Clinton might now be mouthing the right words for winning my heart and mind; however, I have neither forgiven nor will I ever forget, what she and her husband did to this country in the 1990s. That is, to flood it with Third World parasites and sing the diversity hymns of  holier-than-thou &ldquo;competitive altruism&rdquo; and the &ldquo;New Class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine months after marching for gay pride, Mrs. Clinton refused to march in the 240th St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade, once a must for all New York City politicians. The Ancient Order of Hibernians, the fraternal Roman Catholic group that runs the parade, does not permit the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization to march as a unit; and Mrs. Clinton had been chastised by gay rights groups for marching on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in 2000. That Senator Clinton would appease the homosexuals, even if it meant affronting Irish Catholics, testifies to the new balance of power in the Democratic party and the new correlation of forces in the culture war.&rdquo; (Patrick J. Buchanan, The Death of the West, 2002, pgs. 45-46.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Portland State in 1998, Mr. Clinton rhapsodized to a cheering student audience about a day when Americans of European descent will be a minority.</p>
<p>&#8216;Today, largely because of immigration, there is no majority race<br>
in Hawaii or Huston or New York City. Within five years there<br><br>
will be no majority race in our largest state California. In little more than fifty years there will be no majority race in the UnitedStates. No other nation has gone through demographic change ofthis magnitude in so short a time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Correction: no nation in history has gone through a demographic change of this magnitude in so short a time, and remained the same nation. Mr. Clinton assured us it will be a better America when we are all minorities and realize true &lsquo;diversity.&rsquo; Well, those students are going to find out, for they will spend their golden years in a Third World America.&rdquo; (Buchanan, 2002, pg. 3.)</p>
<p>In the future it will not be votes or lost elections facing the Clintons, Gates, and Dornans  of this Third World <span class="caps">USA, </span>it will be their lives and standard of living. In this future, as ordinary rank and file whites begin to react, organize, and clash with their fellow &ldquo;minorities&rdquo; for power and resources, I very much doubt that they will be in any mood to express very much &ldquo;competitive altruism&rdquo; toward the Multi Cult &ldquo;Bobos,&rdquo; of their ilk. No, it is going to be a question of competitive retribution and justice, at that point in history. Then, you will hear many a white traitor pig, screaming as if stuck!</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I have no problem with aiding the tsunami victims, provided that those who are rushing their contributions use more discernment.  There are repeated calls to contribute through the <span class="caps">U.N. </span>or through Unicef or <span class="caps">CARE, </span>which in my opinion, is not a good idea.</p>
<p>I understand that Americares, which is contributing to the relief effort, dontates 99% of contributions to the relief effort and the other 1% is for administration and overhead.  </p>
<p>Undoubtedly, other charities will suffer a shortfall due to the daily call to contribute to the tsunami-hit areas.  It seems that the measure of charity tends to parallel the nationwide and worldwide publicity an event receives.  </p>
<p>As reported here on Amren.com, there are charities that also aid the Afrikaners in South Africa.  Balancing contributions is important, and we must all balance to whom and to what cause we give, remembering that &#8220;God loveth a cheerful giver.&#8221;  </p></font><p>Posted

<p>Many Jewish people I have known could be described as above. In the end, if America becomes a nonwhite run Third World Marxist gutter-hellhole, the Diversity Gestapo that will be employed to &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; terrorize and &ldquo;sensitivity&rdquo; reeducate American Whites, will not discriminate between Jew or Gentile. All whites will be targeted and any group identification (religious, political, social, etc.) will be subject to scrutiny and the denunciation of &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;  My greatest hope is that this does not come to pass and a great majority of whites do wakeup, before it is too late. However, my most grim vision of the future is just as you described, an anti-white Red &ldquo;racial doomsday.&rdquo; In other words, The Camp of the Saints meets 1984; not a very pleasant thought at all!</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Thanks for this thoughtful essay.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago I sent a post suggesting that Christ and his teachings have influenced white people&rsquo;s behavior.  I mentioned that Christ&rsquo;s not marrying and not having children was a bad example.  Someone posted in reply that Jesus was in fact married, but of course this is irrelevant since it&rsquo;s the belief of hundreds of miliions of Christian that he was not, and that he did not reproduce.  </p>
<p>Christ is again called to mind by this article.  &#8220;Whatever you do unto the <span class="caps">LEAST </span>of my brethren, you do unto me,&#8221; he said.  This was a powerful message.  Consider:  anyone with a charitable disposition, as well as spiritually or egotistically ambitious individuals, can please <span class="caps">CHRIST, </span>can be &#8220;holy,&#8221; by being especially charitable to the <span class="caps">LEAST </span>element.  It can be done easily, once one is independant and has any money or power.  I don&rsquo;t recall Jesus doing anything for people of means, which of course would be much more difficult.  He was a friend of the poor and of sinners.  To bend over backwards to help the lowest and smite the highest is to be like Christ.  </p>
<p>This idea took off on the wings of time.  As the man says in the beginning of the Radio City Christmas show, no one in history has had the influence on the world that this one baby born in Bethleham has had.  The fact that the idea has survived and has become counterproductive to the well being of the entire world is something that needs to be addressed.  To fight it head on would be futile.  It&rsquo;s too pervasive and has the character of ultimate right to it.  Some new idea has to come along that will nudge this outdated idea in a slightly different direction.  </p></font><p>Posted

<p>&#8220;To bend over backwards to help the lowest and smite the highest is to be like Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t what Christ taught. That&rsquo;s marxism, based on a philosophy of greed and envy, which produced the atheist totalitarian states of Russia and China, where millions of Christians were exterminated.<br>
Smite the highest and you end up with economic collapse and gulags. That&rsquo;s exactly what occurred in both Russia and China and inflicted untold poverty on the people of these countries for nearly a century. And 100 million people were eliminated in these two countries alone.<br><br>
Is that what it means &#8220;to be like Christ?&#8221;</p>

<p>I read Dr Jobling&rsquo;s article on Competitive Altruism and White Self-Destruction with care from start to finish.</p>
<p>With regard to the sentence: &#8216;Burlington confirms one of the great laws of American race relations: the amount of sympathy whites feel for minorities is in inverse proportion to their experience with them.&rsquo; I regret to confirm that there might be some measure of veracity in it.</p>
<p>In 1976, shortly after I left university, I met a young Pakistani man who was preparing for a career in accountancy - South Asians prefer careers intimately connected with the gravy train. He told me that when a &#8216;white&rsquo; man renders help to his co-nationals he is &#8220;used and then thrown away.&#8221;</p>

  <font size="3"><p>I seem to be having a hard time getting my point across.  Last time I brought up Christ as a bad example in terms of reproduction, I also got only negative reactions.  I accept some of the responsibility for this, but it&rsquo;s also true that some posters are reading pretty carelessly.</p>
<p>First, to clarify my position:</p>
<p>I grew up Catholic, in the midwest.  I am now an atheist who is broken-hearted about the ruination of my country, the <span class="caps">US.  </span></p>
<p>To simplify my point:</p>
<p>Christianity has been a strong influence on millions of people in the <span class="caps">US.  </span>(I&rsquo;m not saying that only Christians are ruining things, but most are not resisting.)</p>
<p>Christianity follows the teachings of Christ, who made a point of paying attention to the poor, the downtrodden, sinners, etc.  He preached charity and didn&rsquo;t much like the rich.  For modern day American Christians, to help the wretched, that is, the immigrants, the third worlders, is indeed &#8216;holy&rsquo; from the standpoint of Christ and Christianity.  </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it possible that this &#8216;philosophy&rsquo; is one of the causes of, or at least is a tremendous help in, the <span class="caps">GIVEAWAY </span>of our formerly great country??  And if so, shouldn&rsquo;t concerned white people try to figure out a way of <span class="caps">MODIFYING </span>it???</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m wrong, fine.  Give me some arguments against.  But please don&rsquo;t just react as if I&rsquo;m waving a cross in the air, or a hammer and syckle.  (sp?)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how we can ignore possible causes of our downfall if we hope to change the direction we&rsquo;re going in.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>    To the anonymous poster above:  You are understood, and I agree with what you are saying about some Christians.  Let me give you an example, and you can let me know if I&rsquo;m on the right track.  </p>
<p>     A few years ago, here in Atlanta, there was an article in the Journal/Constitution about some female church types who were going down to the ghetto and giving money and clothes and other things to &#8220;poor&#8221; American Africans.  The article stated how all these women, no husbands of course, had multiple children, and were on welfare.  The teenage girls also became pregnant, and everyone was basically having babies.  One of the female church types was quoted as saying &#8220;No, we don&rsquo;t really approve of all these babies being born, but we can&rsquo;t not help them because of this&#8221;.  </p>
<p>    Am I on the right track to your thinking?  I think I am and I agree with what you are saying.  If all this altruism causes whites to do nothing but help others, while our world is crumbling, then altruism is not &#8220;all good&#8221; and it certainly isn&rsquo;t to our gain.  Quite conversely, it will be our downfall.  In fact, it already is.</p></font><p>Posted

I believe that through Christian beliefs (which are very expansionist   &mdash;   &#8216;spreading the gospel&rsquo; and so on and so forth) and superior weaponry has catapulted Europeans into the forefront of culture.  When non-whites become the primary rulers of the United States (if there still is one at that time) I fear they will not have learned their lessons.

  <font size="3"><p>It&rsquo;s curious and puzzling that Ian Jobling presents his article as something of a rebuttal (or that it is regarded as such) to Kevin MacDonald&rsquo;s thesis of Jewish impetus for the &#8220;corrosion of white identity&#8221; in the United States when it comports perfectly with the thesis. Kevin MacDonald argues accurately that Jews have exploited the altruistic element of the West for their own interests, investing such political movements as the revolutionary change of immigration-policies of the United States in favor of Third World immigrants (among others) in language that clasps the altruistic sense of Westerners. He explains, &#8220;Jews are only a small percentage of the population of white nations, and could not have corroded white identity without the consent of whites,&#8221; but continues, &#8220;Theories about altruism do not require that people understand their own motives any better than a hen understand why she sits on her eggs,&#8221; implying that this sense of altruism is innate in Westerners, essential to the distinct identity of the West itself, and thus inevitable. In fact, this is the subject of the entire article. How, then, have whites &#8220;consented to the corrosion of their identity&#8221; if this elemental aspect of the West and Westerners has been exploited in contravention to their own interests?</p>

  <font size="3"><p>I&rsquo;m going to try to make an analogy.  When I was sick with cancer some years ago, I was fortunate to have an excellent doctor, an internist.  I also read Bernie Seigel&rsquo;s book, which in fact frightened me.  Dr. Siegel was an oncologist who shaved his head to show solidarity with his patients.  My doctor, on the other hand, kept his hair as well as his place in the world of the healthy.  Looking back on it, he was my link with that world, and I used him, as he wanted to be used, to help me get myself back to it.  It was important to me that he remain well, so I could depend on him to be able to help me until I got well (or died, which fortunately wasn&rsquo;t my fate).  A bit like you would want someone who was pulling you out of water to remain in a sturdy place.</p>
<p>If you put &rsquo; <span class="caps">ALTRUISM </span>&rsquo; into google, the incredible confusion about the meaning of the word, of the concept, is apparent.  It really means sacrificing the self for others, putting others <span class="caps">BEFORE </span>the self, not just being benevolent or practising charity.  It would have the doctor give up his health for the patient, not just shave his head!  It is therefore an <span class="caps">ABSURD </span>idea, since carried to an extreme, as we are witnessing, it is suicidal, and in the end, everyone loses.  Whether our altruistic fellow Americans know the meaning or not, they&rsquo;re certainly practising it in its true sense.  </p>
<p>I remember hearing, in my Catholic school, the story of some saint who spent his days on top of a pillar outside his church and put the worms back into his wounds.  Ignoring the fact that we now know that the worms probably cleaned the wounds and kept him alive, the guy was hideously crazy.  But he was actually held up to us as a holy man.  How crazy making for children.  We were supposed to be clean and neat as nuns, but we still had to have in our heads that it was holy to be wretched and filthy.  The last shall be first and the first last, and all that.  Unfortunates were given a special place, above &#8216;normal&rsquo; people.  </p>
<p>Of course there is no gratitude for this kind of nonsense.  It&rsquo;s actually contemptible to be a sycophant, to self destruct, to commit public suicide while imagining oneself to be holy and <span class="caps">GOOD.</span> Where I live, most blacks one meets in the course of a day, and one meets many of them, treat Whites with utter contempt.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Sue: <br>
A few years ago a couple of well-off Jewish women I knew gave time and money to a home for unwed poor black girls in our area.  I used to pass the building often and had an antipathy to the place.  The young girls used to hang out in front with their boyfriends looking sullen and miserable.  When one of these women asked me if I wanted to get involved, I had to say no.  I felt a little guilty, and couldn&rsquo;t have put into words why I just couldn&rsquo;t do it, but I couldn&rsquo;t.  I don&rsquo;t want any baby to suffer, but to support the place just didn&rsquo;t seem right to me.  As I said the women were Jewish.  It isn&rsquo;t only Christians who are benevolent to the point of altruism.  Maybe the idea started with Christ but became attractive to people of other faiths.  I don&rsquo;t know.  </p>
<p>When it comes to helping babies, it&rsquo;s hard to say no.  If you actually see them, it&rsquo;s probably close to impossible.  But yes, this is pretty much what I mean.  </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I think there is something to that altruistic stuff. There have been a couple of instances, in a parking lot where one or two blacks asked me for a ride somewhere. Both times I turned them down. </p>
<p>My reason was that I did not want to take the chance of being robbed, having my car stolen, or being shot to death. Both times were around Christmas. </p>
<p>Even though I knew there was a possibility of something bad happening, I still felt guilty about not giving those blacks a ride. It was cold outside. It was Christmas. </p>
<p>Of course the thought that floated to the surface was that I did not want to take the chance of ruining my family&rsquo;s holiday by maybe having something bad happen. Especially since both times I was making a quick run to the store and was expected back home in just a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>These episodes make me think that white people do have an altruistic switch that can be flipped. I think it can be a good thing but I also think it can set us up to be played for fools or worse.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Thank you all for your comments on my article. I&rsquo;m glad most of you found it worthwhile.</p>
<p>To Puzzled:</p>
<p>My article is not meant as a rebuttal to Kevin MacDonald&rsquo;s theory about the role of Jews in Western societies. The article is neutral towards this theory, neither confirming nor contradicting it. All I say is that Prof. MacDonald&rsquo;s theories do not <i>completely</i> explain why whites do not pursue their racial interests. I doubt Prof. MacDonald believes that Jewish influence is the <i>only</i> reason for white dispossession.</p>
<p>To TheBitterPill:</p>
<p>Yes, Christianity is one of the major reasons why whites do not stand up for themselves, but I think competitive altruism is the reason why Christian behavior takes the form it does. I deal with this in the article.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>  What passes for Christianity in today&rsquo;s modern liberal churches has little to do with the gospel. The message of salvation has been hijacked by the same group that has taken over every other area of public life. The burden for the lost has been replaced by a burden for the hungry. And yes, many people seem to believe that a person can work his way to heaven. Christ and particularly the writers of the Epistles did not teach this. Salvation is through grace, not works.  Works are the fruit of salvation, not the means to it. Evil has done what it always does. What is good in anything is twisted and perverted into a counterfeit.<br>
 Competitive altruism is to me totally opposed to Christ&rsquo;s teachings. It has its roots in pride and love of prestige. Pride isn&rsquo;t exactly a popular concept in the Bible.  Christ strongly condemned those who performed acts of charity for public recognition (Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing). Yes, he helped the poor.  However, contrary to what some have maintained, he also helped the rich. He raised Jairus&rsquo; daughter. He healed the Centurion&rsquo;s servant. He healed the Capernaum nobleman&rsquo;s son.<br><br>
 Christ asked people to treat others as they wanted to be treated. What on earth is wrong with that? Would anyone really want to live in a society that totally ignored that commandment? <br><br>
 As for the criticism above that he did not marry, he knew that his purpose in life was to die.  What man would marry knowing he would soon be killed?  Christ did what any sensible man would do. He took into account the consequences of his actions for others  But his not having a family was obviously not intended as a pattern for all. The Lord himself said in the Bible he wanted godly children from marriages. God clearly encouraged and encourages reproduction.  The first commandment in the Bible is to be fruitful and multiply (Genesis 1:28).<br><br>
It was God who gave the commandment to honor your father and mother.  This was the first commandment tied to a promise. To me that means to honor everything about your ancestors, especially the culture they have given. It was Christ who condemned giving to charity to gain society&rsquo;s applause rather than using the money to care for parents. And in 1 Timothy 5:8 we read &#8220;But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.&#8221; Looking first to the welfare of your own house, nation, and race in no way contradicts Christian teaching, at least Bible teaching.  <br><br>
 The idea of some that Christianity promotes a Communist lifestyle seems strange.  Yes, the early Christians shared all they had. However they chose to do this.  The Church did not require it, as the Communist state does. It was always the individual&rsquo;s or group&rsquo;s choice. When Peter spoke to Ananias about the sale of land in Acts 5:4 he said, &#8220;Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?&#8221;<br><br>
  There are many other examples in scripture to prove that God never encourages a light regard for culture and race. Esau&rsquo;s despising his birthright is condemned more than once.  His foreign wives were a grief of mind to his parents. Abraham sent to his own people to find a wife for Isaac.  Jacob also went to his own people to find a wife.   And on and on.<br><br>
I am no scholar or historian.  However it seems that the West has flourished under Christianity.  When liberalism began to parade itself as Christianity things went downhill.  Our ancestors as Christians had no problem with building, with exploring, and  with founding colonies and nations.<br><br>
 Finally, the Bible says, &#8220;Blessed is he who considers the poor.&#8221; (Psalm 41:1), not blessed is he who continually throws money at them.  Charity demands reflection and careful consideration of everything involved.  The notion of promoting a permanent welfare culture is totally foreign to Biblical principles, in my opinion. Paul in 2 Thessalonians 3:10 said if any would not work he should not eat. In 1 Thessalonians 4:11-12 Paul commanded believers to work to take care of personal needs. Even in the Old Testament the able-bodied poor were expected to glean out of the fields. Connecting  the receipt of welfare with productive labor today would be right in line with scripture.<br><br>
 This is a wonderful site and the posts are extremely interesting. I understand as well as any here the anger at the multi-cultural madness that surrounds us. My father was murdered by blacks and a good friend was shot. Yet another elderly family friend was viciously murdered by young blacks. I have seen the horror of diversity in the real world.  The road to hell these days is often paved with multi-cultural nonsense. However, the rationale used to justify this racial suicide is in no way genuinely Christian. For me there is no conflict between my Christian faith and a desire to see the white race survive.<br><br>
