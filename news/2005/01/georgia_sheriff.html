<p><font size="3"><p>JONESBORO, Ga. &mdash; On his first day at work, the new sheriff of Clayton County called 27 employees into his office on Monday, fired them and had snipers stand guard on the roof as they were escorted out the door.</p>
<p>A judge on Tuesday ordered him to rehire the employees.</p>
<p>The sheriff, Victor Hill, 39, defended the firings and said he had the right to shake up the department in whatever way he felt necessary.</p>
<p>Sheriff Hill also said it was necessary to fire the workers the way he did, including taking some deputies home in vans normally used to transport prisoners because the deputies were barred from using county cars.</p>
<p>Sheriff Hill was among a spate of black candidates elected last year in the county, which was once dominated by rural whites. The fired employees included four of the highest-ranking officers, all of them white. Sheriff Hill told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that their replacements would be black.</p>

<p>There are various pro-white groups and organizations and whites should seek them out and join the ones that suit their individual personalities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to be white and it&rsquo;s noble to fight for our survival against all white haters.  The actions of this sheriff, sure sound like white hate to me.  This guy should be arrested for a hate crime.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>If this had been a new white sheriff firing black employees, there would be nationwide press converage and the Justice Dept. would launch a massive civil rights investigation.  Within a week we&rsquo;d be treated to special 20/20 and Dateline newcasts deriding the whites for their intolerance towards the saintly blacks.</p>
<p>Whites should get used to stories like this as they will become more numerous as our population continues to decrease and more towns and cities fall to hostile non-whites. Blacks, and specifically black men are some of the most hate filled bigots you could ever imagine.  Even the seemingly inoffensive, semi-articulate &#8220;good&#8221; blacks. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>I would like to see the reaction of our nation if it had been a white firing 27 blacks and putting deputies on the roof with sniper rifles.  The media would pound it down our throats for years.  Hollywood would make more phony movies like &#8220;Attica&#8221; where the poor prisoners who never did anything wrong get shot just for taking a few hostages.  Jesse and Al would call for more money and &#8220;Affirmative Action&#8221;, and <span class="caps">L.A. </span>would have another riot.

  <font size="3"><p>The new sheriff has now locked himself into the hearts and minds of his voting constituents. So I imagine the next big news story out of Clayton County will probably cover the slow, but sure exodus of the white population. And with dwindling tax dollars to pay for the department: a reduction of officers, a smaller force, a drop in crime prevention and finally state dollars poured into some commission on how this all happened.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>     The most recent thing I have heard on local news is that the lawyer representing (I guess) all the fired deputies and supervisors, black and white (I guess), is saying that there is a law in Georgia that allows the Governor to step in and remove or take some sort of legal action against a sheriff who is obviously out of control.  </p>
<p>     Sheriff Vernon Hill of Clayton County complied partially with the judge&rsquo;s order to rehire all the fired deputies.  So, Hill rehired them, but immediately put them all on paid administrative leave.  The lawyer for the deputies says that this is not complying with the judge&rsquo;s orders, and if Hill doesn&rsquo;t comply completely, they will ask the Governor to intervene. <br>
  <br><br>
     The whole incident probably wouldn&rsquo;t have made the news were it not for the remark from Hill about &#8220;I&rsquo;m replacing all the deputies fired with black deputies.&#8221;  That showed what he is really all about.  A white hater.<br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>What people should be doing is writing their Senators, Representatives, local newspapers and television news services with the full text of this story attached; as well as legal claims made by the attorney representing the 27 who were illegally discharged. They should be <span class="caps">CALMLY </span>demand equal justice under the law, and they should be decrying the whole hate crimes legislation as a separatist movement by blacks akin to the <span class="caps">KKK </span>movement by select whites.</p>
<p>But the simple fact is few will put forth the time and effort. We tend to prefer to sit down behind the relative safety of our monitors and spew out so many cliché rants about how unfair this is, and expect it to fix itself. The reason these events perpetrate themselves is because of the self-centered white cannibalistic consumer trend of the more recent 20 years. We, yes I am white as the day is long, are more interested in saving a dime by shopping at the box retail outlets (Wal-Mart, Sam&rsquo;s, Costco, Home Depot, etc.) to think about how this simple savings is putting hundreds of thousands of little &#8220;Mom and Pop&#8221; shops out of business. I know this sounds like I have pulled from the target of the message, but it is a cavalcade effect. We destroy our local neighborhoods, which causes property value drops, with brings in high density housing, which increases crime, which creates a call for law-enforcement to stop harassing blacks and Hispanics, which creates an environment that puts such a quality human being such as Mr. Hill into office. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t respond to this or this article posted on Amren, open Word - Word Perfect - Open Office - your choice, and put together an intelligent, well thought-out (passion free) request to all the aforementioned informing them that you and everyone you know will be doing the same. Our elected officials play the lofty part of government intellectuals (&#8220;Well you simple people just don&rsquo;t understand why we do some of the things we do&#8221;), but in fact they are largely simple and motivated by nothing more than numbers. If we don&rsquo;t put up the numbers they won&rsquo;t move against this rogue Sheriff. But you can bet every penny you have that they will respond to the big money lobbyist on the left who will rush to the aid of Mr. Hill. Just as soon as the heat starts to rise, the <span class="caps">ACLU,</span> Jesse, Al, and all the others bilk a comfortable living, and continue to perpetrated crimes against blacks, will rush to the aid of this poor black victim of white race hate.</p>
<p>If you respond to this with anything other than a copy of your letter to your representatives and new services, you will have defined yourself accordingly. <br>
