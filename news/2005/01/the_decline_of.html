<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The October 11, 1999, cover story of <i>National Review</i> was a piece
by Senior Editor Ramesh Ponnuru called &#8220;A Conservative No More,&#8221; which
argued that Patrick Buchan-an has abandoned conservative principles. The
article complained about Mr. Buchanan&rsquo;s isolationism, opposition to free
trade, and support for certain government programs, but the most serious
charge appeared in the subtitle: &#8220;The tribal politics of Pat Buchan-an.&#8221;
According to Mr. Ponnuru, &#8220;Buchananism is a form of identity politics for
white people – and becomes more worrisome as it is married to collectivism.&#8221;
Any expression of white identity is now apparently a betrayal of conservatism.
It was not always so.
<p><i>National Review</i> is considered the flagship publication of post-World
War II conservatism. William F. Buckley started it in 1955, declaring that
it &#8220;stands athwart history yelling Stop, at a time when no one is inclined
to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.&#8221; Mr. Buckley
was yelling &#8220;stop&#8221; to the spread of communism abroad and liberalism at
home. That it should now attack Mr. Buchanan for supporting protectionism
and market intervention is consistent with founding principles and no surprise.
But few would have thought that after 44 years of publication, a senior
editor with an Indian surname would condemn a popular white conservative
for speaking up for whites.&nbsp;

In fact, the <i>National Review</i> of the 1950s, 60s and even 70s spoke
up for white people far more vigorously than Pat Buchanan would ever dare
to today. The early <i>National Review</i> heaped criticism on the civil
rights movement, <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, and people like Adam
Clayton Powell and Martin Luther King, whom it considered race hustlers.
Some of the greatest names in American conservatism – Russell Kirk, Willmore
Kendall, James Kilpatrick, Richard Weaver, and a young Bill Buckley – wrote
articles defending the white South and white South Africans in the days
of segregation and apartheid. NR attacked the 1965 immigration bill that
opened America up to Third-World immigration, and wrote frankly about racial
differences in IQ. There were always hints of compromise, but passages
from some back issues could have been lifted right out of <i>American Renaissance</i>.
Not so today. NR still supports immigration reform and is not afraid of
the IQ debate, but Mr. Ponnuru&rsquo;s article is just one example of its complete
abandonment of the interests of whites as a group. What used to be an important
part of the NR message it now dismissed as illegitimate &#8220;white identity
politics.&#8221;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&#8220;Why the South Must Prevail&#8221;</font></b>
<p>A famous example of the early NR stance on race was an unsigned editorial
of August 24, 1957, titled &#8220;Why the South Must Prevail.&#8221; It was almost
certainly written by Mr. Buckley, since he uses similar language in his
book <i>Up From Liberalism</i>. The editorial argued against giving blacks
the vote because it would undermine civilization in the South:
<blockquote>&#8220;The central question that emerges &hellip; is whether the White
community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary
to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas in which it does not prevail
numerically? The sobering answer is Yes – the White community is so entitled
because, for the time being, it is the advanced race. It is not easy, and
it is unpleasant, to adduce statistics evidencing the cultural superiority
of White over Negro: but it is a fact that obtrudes, one that cannot be
hidden by ever-so-busy egalitarians and anthropologists.&#8221;
<p>&#8220;<i>National Review</i> believes that the South&rsquo;s premises are correct.
&hellip; It is more important for the community, anywhere in the world, to
affirm and live by civilized standards, than to bow to the demands of the
numerical majority.&#8221;
<p>&#8220;The South confronts one grave moral challenge. It must not exploit
the fact of Negro backwardness to preserve the Negro as a servile class.
&hellip; Let the South never permit itself to do this. So long as it is merely
asserting the right to impose superior mores for whatever period it takes
to effect a genuine cultural equality between the races, and so long as
it does so by humane and charitable means, the South is in step with civilization,
as is the Congress that permits it to function.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>The final passage about &#8220;genuine cultural equality between the races&#8221;
can be read either as a last-minute loss of will <i>or</i> as a description
of a criterion for the black franchise that <i>could never be met</i>.
In any case, the editorial recognizes a principle NR would never articulate
today: the right of a civilized minority – racial or otherwise – to impose
its will upon an uncivilized majority. NR Contributing Editor L. Brent
Bozell dissented from the editorial on constitutional grounds but still
admitted, &#8220;It is understandable that White Southerners should try to have
it both ways – they can&rsquo;t <i>know</i> what would happen should Negroes
begin to vote, and they naturally want to cover their bet.&#8221;&nbsp;
<p>Needless to say, even in the 1950s, when the interests of whites were
more openly recognized, the editorial called down the wrath of the liberals.
Prof. William Muehl of the Yale Divinity School wrote: [I]n that vicious
and wholly amoral thesis you exposed again the basic savagery of the reactionary
mentality at bay.&#8221; Would anything NR publishes today evoke such fury from
established liberals?
<p>But Mr. Buckley&rsquo;s magazine stood firm. A book review from the July 13th
issue of the same year – 1957 – by Richard Weaver was called, &#8220;Integration
is Communization.&#8221; Mr. Weaver found Carl Rowan&rsquo;s <i>Go South to Sorrow</i>
&#8220;a sorry specimen of Negro intellectual leadership,&#8221; and went on to express
deep suspicion about the whole integrationist enterprise:&nbsp;
<blockquote>&#8221; &#8216;Integration&rsquo; and &#8216;Communization&rsquo; are, after all, pretty
closely synonymous. In light of what is happening today, the first may
be little more than a euphemism for the second. It does not take many steps
to get from the &#8216;integrating&rsquo; of facilities to the &#8216;communizing&rsquo; of facilities,
if the impulse is there.&#8221;&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>He concluded with a restatement of the principles of voluntary association.
&#8220;In a free society, associations for educational, cultural, social, and
business purposes have a right to protect their integrity against political
fanaticism. The alternative to this is the destruction of free society
and the replacement of its functions by government, which is the Marxist
dream.&#8221; Government&rsquo;s current &#8220;civil rights&#8221; powers to limit freedom of
association have, indeed, brought virtually every corner of our lives under
bureaucratic control, but would NR dare say so today?
<p>Likewise in 1957, Sam M. Jones interviewed segregationist Senator Richard
Russell of Georgia. In a Q&A format, Mr. Jones asked, &#8220;Do the people
of the South fear political domination by the Negro or miscegenation or
both?&#8221;&nbsp;
<p>Senator Russell replied, &#8220;Both. As you know, Mr. Jones, there are some
communities and some states where the Negro&rsquo;s voting potential is very
great. We wish at all costs to avoid a repetition of the Reconstruction
period when newly freed slaves made the laws and undertook their enforcement.
We feel even more strongly about miscegenation or racial amalgamation.&nbsp;
<p>&#8220;The experience of other countries and civilizations has demonstrated
that the separation of the races biologically is highly preferable to amalgamation.
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;I know of nothing in human history that would lead us to conclude
that miscegenation is desirable.&#8221;
<p>Sam M. Jones wrote another article that year criticizing integration
in the Washington, D.C., public schools. Titled &#8220;Caution: Integration at
Work,&#8221; he accurately predicted that &#8220;the problem of school integration
in the nation&rsquo;s capital may be eventually solved by the steady migration
of the white population out of the District of Columbia.&#8221; Jones criticized
school integration on the grounds of IQ differences, citing &#8220;a white average
ranging from 105 to 111 and&nbsp; a Negro average of 87 to 89. (An intelligent
quotient of 85 is generally considered the minimum for receiving education.)&#8221;
He went on to note:&nbsp;
<blockquote>&#8220;Data on juvenile delinquency &hellip; revealed a marked increase
in truancy, theft, vandalism and sex-offenses in integrated schools. Dances
and dramatic presentations have been quietly given up by most high schools.
Senior and junior class plays have been discontinued. Inter-racial fights
are frequent and constant vigilance is required to prevent molestation
or attempted molestation of white girls by Negro boys or girls. In contrast,
the schools outside the integrated neighborhoods have no more such problems
than they had four years ago.&#8221; Mr. Jones concluded that &#8220;the record shows
&hellip; that the problems of integration are extremely serious and that no
solution is in sight.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>The September 28, 1957 issue contained a piece by James Kilpatrick
called &#8220;Right and Power in Arkansas,&#8221; in which he endorsed Arkansas Governor
Orval Faubus&rsquo; call-up of the National Guard to prevent forced integration
at Little Rock&rsquo;s Central High School. Defending a community&rsquo;s right to
keep the peace, he wrote that &#8220;the State of Arkansas and Orval Faubus are
wholly in the right; they have acted lawfully; they are entitled to those
great presumptions of the law which underlie the whole of our judicial
tradition.&#8221; Predicting a &#8220;storm&#8221; of white resistance he wrote, &#8220;Conceding,
for the sake of discussion, that the Negro pupil has these new rights,
what of the white community? <i>Has it none?</i>&#8221;
<p>An unsigned editorial in the September 21, 1957, issue put the blame
for the whole incident squarely on the Supreme Court:
<blockquote>&#8220;Under the disintegrating effects of <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>,
the units of our society are forced into absolute dilemmas for which there
is literally no solution within the traditional American structure.&nbsp;
<p>&#8220;Violence and the threat of violence; base emotions; the cynical exploitation
of members of both races by ruthless ideologues; the shameful spectacle
of heavily armed troops patrolling the lawns and schoolyards of once tranquil
towns and villages; the turgid dregs of hatred, envy, resentment, and sorrow
– all these are part of the swelling harvest of <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>On the tenth anniversary of <i>Brown</i>, NR offered this June 2,
1964, editorial:
<blockquote>&#8220;But whatever the exact net result in the restricted field
of school desegregation, what a price we are paying for Brown! It would
be ridiculous to hold the Supreme Court solely to blame for the ludicrously
named &#8216;civil rights movement&rsquo; – that is, the Negro revolt &hellip; . But the
Court carries its share of the blame. Its decrees, beginning with <i>Brown</i>,
have on the one hand encouraged the least responsible of the Negro leaders
in the course of extra-legal and illegal struggle that we now witness around
us&hellip; .
<p>&#8220;<i>Brown</i>, as <i>National Review</i> declared many years ago, was
bad law and bad sociology. We are now tasting its bitter fruits. Race relations
in the country are ten times worse than in 1954.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>In the 1960s NR continued to oppose the civil rights movement and
the assumption that race could somehow be reduced to irrelevance. A July
2, 1963, editorial declared: &#8220;The Negro people have been encouraged to
ask for, and to believe they can get, nothing less than the evanescence
of color, and they are doomed to founder on the shoals of existing human
attitudes – their own included.&#8221; Race, as AR continues to point out, cannot
be made not to matter, and NR once understood that.
<p>An article by James Kilpatrick in the September 24, 1963, issue argued
that the Civil Rights Bill (eventually passed in 1964) should be voted
down. He wrote, &#8220;I believe this bill is a very bad bill. In my view, the
means here proposed are the wrong means&hellip; . In the name of achieving
certain &#8216;rights&rsquo; for one group of citizens this bill would impose some
fateful compulsions on another group of citizens.&#8221; After it passed, an
editorial declared: &#8220;The Civil Rights Act has been law for only a little
over two months, yet it already promises to be the source of much legalistic
confusion, civic chaos and bureaucratic malpractice.&#8221;&nbsp;
<p>Mr. Kilpatrick also took aim at the 1965 Voting Rights Act in the April
20, 1965 issue. &#8220;Must We Repeal the Constitution to Give the Negro the
Vote?&#8221; he asked, accusing the bill&rsquo;s supporters of&nbsp; &#8220;perverting the
Constitution.&#8221; He thought certain blacks should be given the right to vote
but notes, &#8220;Over most of this century, the great bulk of Southern Negroes
have been genuinely unqualified for the franchise.&#8221; He also defended segregation
as rational for Southerners. &#8220;Segregation is a fact, and more than a fact;
it is a state of mind. It lies in the Southern subconscious next to man&rsquo;s
most elementary instincts, for self-preservation, for survival, for the
untroubled continuation of a not intolerable way of life.&#8221;
<p>Mr. Buckley softened his position on civil rights in the 1960s but to
a point that would still be intolerable for conservatives today. In a column
written five months before the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and
called &#8220;The Issue at Selma,&#8221; he called for giving blacks the vote but perhaps
restricting the franchise to high school graduates. He sympathized with
the Southern position writing, &#8220;In much of the South, what is so greatly
feared is irresponsible, mobocratic rule, and it is a fear not easily dissipated,
because it is well-grounded that if the entire Negro population in the
South were suddenly given the vote, and were to use it as a bloc, and pursuant
to directives handed down by some of the more demagogic leaders, chaos
would ensue.&#8221; He also warned of &#8220;a suddenly enfranchised, violently embittered
Negro population which will take the vote and wield it as an instrument
of vengeance, shaking down the walls of Jericho even to their foundations,
and reawakening the terrible genocidal antagonisms that scarred the Southern
psyche during the days of Reconstruction.&#8221;
<p>Mr. Buckley expressed similar doubts about multiracial democracy in
his 1959 <i>Up From Liberalism</i>: &#8220;Democracy&rsquo;s finest bloom is seen only
in its natural habitat, the culturally homogenous community. There, democracy
induces harmony. Harmony (not freedom) is demo-cracy&rsquo;s finest flower. Even
a politically unstable society of limited personal freedom can be harmonious
if governed democratically, if only because the majority understand themselves
to be living in the house that they themselves built.&#8221;

<br><b><font size="-1">Cartoon from the issue of June 13, 1957.</font></b>
<br><b><font size="-1">Would we see its like today?</font></b></div>
<p>NR loathed the &#8220;Black Power&#8221; movement, which it described in a July
19, 1966, editorial as a natural outgrowth of the civil rights movement:
<blockquote>&#8220;It isn&rsquo;t surprising when you come to think of it, that the
militants in the civil rights movement should move to a new concept – they
call it Black Power – at this stage, the movement having come into doldrums.
What made it inevitable was the ravenous rhetoric of the past few years,
whose motto &#8216;Freedom Now&rsquo; called for nothing less, when analyzed, than
the evanescence of color. Since no such thing could be brought about, can
be brought about, there is a sense of disappointment among those civil
rights workers who somehow permitted themselves to believe that the passage
of a few bits and pieces of legislation would transform the life of the
American Negro&hellip; . It never followed that Negroes would suddenly cease
to be poor, that whites would cease to prefer the company of whites, that
the overwhelming majority of the American population would not continue
to concentrate on individual and family concerns.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>The February 12, 1963, issue attacked another element of the movement:
&#8220;the Black Muslims – who have no connection with real Mohammedanism – are
ferociously anti-white and anti-Christian &hellip; believe in violence, and
train actively for the War of Armageddon, in which the blacks will kill
all the whites.&#8221;

An October 8, 1968 article called &#8220;Black Power and the Campus&#8221; by David
Brudnoy observes: &#8220;Black power today means a total striving by embittered
groups of Negroes for everything their fancies demand. In its path lie
the crumpled remains of the Constitution, the tattered sleeves of law,
the punctured corpse of Reason, and literally the bodies of those Negroes
and whites who oppose it.&#8221;
<p>In the July 15, 1969 issue we find an editorial about the Black Panthers:
&#8220;Under a portrait of Che Guevara they installed in a church auditorium,
they distribute free food and comic books to kids at breakfasts. The food
is contributed by local merchants, who risk having their stores burned
down (one case so far – enough to make the point) if they refuse. The comics
are crude, nasty affairs depicting heroic black kids killing and intimidating
pigs in police uniforms.&#8221;
<p>NR used to be forthright about dressing down prominent blacks. A June
7, 1958, editorial on Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. stated, &#8220;That Powell is
a racist has been clear for years. Last June, in <i>National Review</i>,
Miss Maureen Buckley covered the subject neatly: &#8216;Adam Clayton Powell&rsquo;s
championing of the Negro cause has led him to a strange racist extremism.&nbsp;
&hellip; In 1946 he pronounced in the <i>Congressional Record</i> his fixed
conclusion that, &#8216;the best thing that could happen would be the passing
of the white man&rsquo;s world [which] has stood for nationalism, oppression,
and barbarism.&rsquo; &#8221;
<p>In the same manner, a September 7, 1965, article by Will Herberg blames
Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement for the 1965 Los Angeles
riots:
<blockquote>&#8220;For years now, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King and his associates
have been deliberately undermining the foundations of internal order in
this country. With their rabble-rousing demagoguery, they have been cracking
the &#8216;cake of custom&rsquo; that holds us together. With their doctrine of &#8216;civil
disobedience&rsquo; they have been teaching hundreds of thousands of Negroes
&hellip; that it is perfectly all right to break the law and defy constituted
authority if you are a Negro-with-a-grievance&hellip; . And they have done
more than talk. They have on occasion after occasion, in almost every part
of the country, called out their mobs on the streets, promoted &#8216;school
strikes&rsquo; sit-ins, lie-ins, in explicit violation of the law and in explicit
violation of the public authority. They have taught anarchy and chaos by
word and deed &hellip; .&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>In 1979 Mr. Buckley was still criticizing Martin Luther King saying,
&#8220;When it was black men persecuting white or black men – in the Congo, for
instance – he was strangely silent on the issue of human rights. The human
rights of Chinese, or of Caucasians living behind the Iron Curtain never
appeared to move him.&#8221; This is pretty mild criticism but it would not appear
in today&rsquo;s NR, which fawns over King as much as the liberals do.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A Reliable Voice&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>Criticism of the American Civil Rights movement was not the only way
in which NR used to promote &#8220;identity politics for white people.&#8221; It wrote
articles about South Africa clearly endorsing apartheid as the only workable
system for the country. In the March 9, 1965, issue Russell Kirk decried
court-enforced black voting rights as &#8220;theoretical folly&#8221; that the US would
nevertheless survive, but declared prophetically that the same dogma in
South Africa, &#8220;if applied, would bring anarchy and the collapse of civilization.&#8221;
For Kirk, civilization required apartheid: &#8220;In a time of virulent &#8216;African
nationalism,&rsquo; &hellip; how is South Africa&rsquo;s &#8216;European&rsquo; population &hellip; to
keep the peace and preserve a prosperity unique in the Dark Continent?&#8221;
White rule, he answered, is a prudent way, &#8220;to govern tolerably a society
composed of several races, among which only a minority is civilized.&#8221; He
called for humane treatment of South African blacks but dismissed their
leaders as &#8220;witch doctors&#8221; and &#8220;reckless demagogues.&#8221; He wrote frankly
about the &#8221; &#8216;European&rsquo; element which makes South Africa the only modern
and prosperous African country.&#8221;

reading&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Lubinskas&rsquo; article about the firm positions NR used to take
on racial matters, I was curious to know how Mr. Buckley would explain

fax her an outline of the subjects I wanted to cover, so I sent several
past and present quotations from NR, explain- ing that I wanted to know why
the magazine had shifted its ground. A few days later, I telephoned her
again to ask about the interview and she told me Mr. Buckley is writing
a book and giving no interviews. I asked why I had been asked to summarize
what I wanted to talk about if he is giving no interviews, and she told
me to fax the same material again.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The next day, August
5, Mr. Buckley&rsquo;s syndicated news- paper column was about the very questions
I had raised in my faxed message. It was a meandering piece about the Republican
convention&rsquo;s celebration of diversity, but added that Jared Taylor, &#8220;a
white separatist of sorts,&#8221; had wondered whether whites are allowed to
have racial interests as a group. He then quoted several sentences from
the passage from Ernest van den Haag&rsquo;s 1965 article that Mr. Lubin- skas
cites on page six, and which I had included as part of my letter to Mr.
Buckley. The column, which avoids reaching a conclusion about the legitimacy
of white racial consciousness, can be read on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; web&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; page, AmRen.com.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">I telephoned Mr. Buckley&rsquo;s
secretary again, pointed out that Mr. Buckley had used my letter for a
column, and asked once again for an interview. No, she said, Mr. Buckley
is writing a book and must not be disturbed.</font></font>

NR also used to understand immigration. A September 21, 1965, article
by Ernest van den Haag called &#8220;More Immigration?&#8221; took on the impending
reform [signed into law on October 3, 1965, by Lyndon Johnson] that would
open up America to the Third World. Mr. van den Haag, who is still listed
as a contributing editor to NR, argued that our then-sound immigration
laws should be made even stricter, not looser. Rejecting the charge that
the laws were &#8220;racist,&#8221; he wrote: &#8220;one need not believe that one&rsquo;s own
ethnic group, or any ethnic group, is superior to others &hellip; in order
to wish one&rsquo;s country to continue to be made up of the same ethnic strains
in the same proportions as before. And, conversely, the wish not to see
one&rsquo;s country overrun by groups one regards as alien need not be based
on feelings of superiority or &#8216;racism&rsquo;.&#8221; He goes on to say, &#8220;the wish to
preserve one&rsquo;s identity and the identity of one&rsquo;s nation requires no justification
&hellip; any more than the wish to have one&rsquo;s own children, and to continue
one&rsquo;s family through them need be justified or rationalized by a belief
that they are superior to the children of others.&#8221;
<p>A September 26, 1975, review of Jean Raspail&rsquo;s <i>The Camp of the Saints</i>
makes much the same point. Prof. Jeffrey Hart, who is currently listed
as a senior editor, called the book a &#8220;sensation&#8221; that rocked liberal sensibilities.
He wrote: &#8220;Most people &hellip; are able to perceive that the &#8216;other group&rsquo;
looks rather different and lives rather differently from their own. Such
&#8216;racist&rsquo; or &#8216;ethnocentric&rsquo; feelings are undoubtedly healthy, and involve
merely a preference for one&rsquo;s own kind. Indeed – and Raspail hammers away
at this point throughout his novel – no group can long survive unless it
does &#8216;prefer itself.&rsquo; &hellip; The liberal rote anathema on &#8216;racism&rsquo; is in
effect a poisonous assault upon Western self-preference.&#8221;
<p>Mr. van den Haag took a thoroughly sound position on IQ differences.
In the December 1, 1964, issue – a full thirty years before <i>The Bell
Curve</i> and five years before Arthur Jensen&rsquo;s celebrated article in the
<i>Harvard Educational Review</i> – he interviewed an unnamed &#8220;eminent
sociologist&#8221; (who happened to be himself). Under the title &#8220;Intelligence
or Prejudice?&#8221; and the subtitle, &#8220;An eminent sociologist discusses Negro
intelligence and accuses certain of his colleagues of prejudice against
logic and discrimination against facts,&#8221; the article took on the ever-trendy
nonsense that intelligence cannot be tested and that the concept of IQ
is meaningless. <table align="LEFT" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

The &#8220;eminent sociologist&#8221; defended IQ testing by citing
the work of Hans Eysenck and research on identical twins. He claimed intelligence
is largely heritable and that environmental factors cannot improve it by
much. Mr. van den Haag wrote that integrated education impairs whites and
&#8220;demoralizes&#8221; blacks, and advocated separation: &#8220;I am all in favor of improving
the quality of education for all. But this can be done only if pupils are
separated according to ability (whatever determines it). And this means
very largely according to race.&#8221;
<p>In an April 8, 1969 column called &#8220;On Negro Inferiority&#8221; Mr. Buckley
wrote about the furor caused by Arthur Jensen&rsquo;s research about race and
IQ, calling it &#8220;massive, apparently authoritative.&#8221; Mr. Buckley even bragged
that &#8220;Professor Ernest van den Haag, writing in <i>National Review</i>
(Dec. 1, 1964) &hellip; brilliantly anticipated the findings of Dr. Jensen
and brilliantly coped with their implications.&#8221;
<p>The late Revilo Oliver, classicist and outspoken racialist, made regular
appearances in the early NR. Mr. Buckley thought so highly of him he put
his name on the masthead and invited him to his wedding. Oliver, who refused
to compromise and was eventually banished from the magazine, also knew
something about race and IQ before Arthur Jensen did. This is from his
November 2, 1957, review of Ashley Montagu&rsquo;s <i>Man: His First Million
Years:</i>
<blockquote>&#8220;Dr. Montagu, who composed the UNESCO Statement on Race, has
again skillfully trimmed the facts of anthropology to fit the Liberal propaganda
line. Every anthropologist knows, for example, that aborigines in Australia
propagated their species for a hundred thousand years without ever suspecting
that pregnancy might be a consequence of sexual intercourse. Equally striking
evidence of intellectual capacity is provided by the many peoples that
never discovered how to kindle a fire or plant a seed. But Dr. Montagu,
after making a great show of cautious objectivity, proclaims that &#8216;anthropologists
are unable to find any evidence&rsquo; of &#8216;significant differences in mental
capacity&rsquo; between &#8216;ethnic groups.&rsquo; If you can tell such whoppers with a
straight face, you too can ask the &#8216;United Nations&rsquo; to recognize your right
to largesse from the pockets of American taxpayers.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No Longer Yelling &#8220;Stop&#8221;</font></b>
<p>Clearly, the early <i>National Review</i> was often a voice for white
Americans. It not only defended their culture, it defended their race.
White Southerners had a right – both constitutionally and morally – to
protect themselves from black rule and black incivility. White South Africans
had the same right. The nation as a whole had a right to defend its European
heritage and racial identity by closing its borders to non-whites. As Mr.
van den Haag wrote, this policy needed no justification. And if low black
intelligence and high crime rates hindered white students from learning,
that was sufficient reason for separate education.
<p>Today&rsquo;s NR has not yet abandoned every subject of interest to whites
<i>qua</i> whites. It is solidly against affirmative action and multicultural
education. It defended <i>The Bell Curve</i> and has published reviews
of J. Philippe Rushton&rsquo;s work. It still advocates immigration reform, though
its position now is that a pause in immigration will make it easier for
the non-whites who are already here to assimilate. Even that stance could
crumble. In 1998 Mr. Buckley demoted the two men most responsible for the
magazines anti-immigration tone, editor John O&rsquo;Sullivan and senior editor
Peter Brimelow. Filling their places are people like Mr. Ponnuru and John
Miller, who like immigration and are afraid of &#8220;identity politics for white
people.&#8221; Today&rsquo;s NR is no longer the brave journal that fought integration
and tried to keep America European. It is not yelling &#8220;stop&#8221; to multiracialism
and the displacement of the country&rsquo;s founding stock by aliens. That, as
Mr. Ponnuru explains, would be to play &#8220;tribal politics.&#8221;
