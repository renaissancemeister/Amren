<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SACRAMENTO &mdash; Democratic lawmakers made their first public rejection of a nominee of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Wednesday, refusing to reappoint to the state Board of Education a Silicon Valley businessman opposed by advocates of bilingual education.</p>
<p>The fight over Reed Hastings, however, had more to do with Democratic Party politics than with the Republican governor. Hastings is a major Democratic donor first appointed by former Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, in 2000.</p>
<p>Hastings lost the support of Latino lawmakers with his aggressive support of English-language reading instruction for immigrant children while he was the board&rsquo;s chairman. After Schwarzenegger renominated him last year, his confirmation hearing in the California Senate was delayed for months because of a lack of support among the Democrats who control the Senate.</p>
<p>Hastings&rsquo; rejection came after an impassioned three-hour committee hearing during which he received support from Democratic State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O&rsquo;Connell, Silicon Valley business leaders, the California Teachers Federation and charter schools that Hastings had personally helped support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is, low-income students and students of color &mdash; especially those struggling to learn English &mdash; have suffered from decades of low expectations,&rdquo; said Russlynn Ali, executive director of the Education Trust-West, an Oakland nonprofit organization to which Hastings has donated. &ldquo;Under Reed Hastings&rsquo; leadership &mdash; as a result of Reed Hastings&rsquo; leadership &mdash; that&rsquo;s changing. Why on Earth would we turn back the clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But many opponents testified that while he was president, the board exceeded its authority by requiring elementary schools to teach students 2 1/2 hours in English each day as a condition of receiving federal funds. That policy was overturned by a court order and subsequent law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed today to be a Democrat, to have to come up here to convince Democrats that this is a good thing,&rdquo; said Steve Barr, president of Green Dot Public Schools, an Inglewood-based charter school group, who testified on Hastings&rsquo; behalf.</p>
