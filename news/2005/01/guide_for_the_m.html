                  <p>Esteemed Countryman:</font></p>
                  <p>The purpose of this guide is 
                    to provide you with practical advice that may prove useful 
                    to you in case you have made the difficult decision to search 
                    for employment opportunities outside of your country.</font></p>
                  <p>The sure way to enter another 
                    country is by getting your passport from the Ministry of Foreign 
                    Affairs, and the visa, which you may apply for at the embassy 
                    or consulate of the country you wish to travel to. </font></p>
                  <div class="text-center"><img src="/news/2005/01/1.JPG" width="348" height="218"></div>
                  <p>However, in practice we see 
                    many Mexicans who try to cross the Northern Border without 
                    the necessary documents, through high risk zones that involve 
                    grave dangers, particularly in desert areas or rivers with 
                    strong, and not always obvious, currents.</font></p>
                  <p>Reading this guide will make 
                    you aware of some basic questions about the legal consequences 
                    of your stay in the United States of America without the appropriate 
                    migratory documents, as well as about the rights you have 
                    in that country, once you are there, independent of your migratory 
                    status. </font></p>
                  <p>Keep in mind always that there 
                    exist legal mechanisms to enter the United States of America 
                    legally.</font></p>
                  <p>In any case, if you encounter 
                    problems or run into difficulties, remember that Mexico has 
                    45 consulates in that country whose locations you can find 
                    listed in this publication.</font></p>

                  <p>Familiarize yourself with the 
                    closest consulate and make use of it.</font></p>

                    IN CROSSING HIGH RISK ZONES</font></p>
                  <p>To cross the river can be very 
                    risky, above all if you cross alone and at night.</font></p>
                  <p>Heavy clothing increases in 
                    weight when wet and this makes swimming and floating difficult.

                  <p>If you cross by desert, try 
                    to walk at times when the heat will not be too intense.</font></p>
                  <p>Highways and population centers 
                    are far apart, which means you will spend several days looking 
                    for roads, and you will not be able to carry foodstuffs or 
                    water for long periods of time. Also, you can get lost.</font></p>

                  <p>Salt water helps keep liquids 
                    in your body. Although you may feel more thirst if you drink 
                    salt water, the risk of dehydration is much less. </font></p>
                  <p>The symptoms of dehydration

                  <p>They can deceive you with assurances 
                    of crossing in a few hours through the mountains and deserts. 
                    This is simply not so!</font></p>
                  <p>They can risk your life taking 
                    you across rivers, drainage canals, desert areas, train tracks,

                  <p>If you decide to hire people 
                    traffickers to cross the border, consider the following precautions:</font></p>
                  <p>Do not let them out of your 
                    sight. Remember that they are the only ones who know the lay 
                    of the land, and therefore the only ones who can get you out 
                    of that place.</font></p>

                    to take you to &#147;the other side&#148; and ask you to drive 
                    a car or to take or carry a package for them. Normally, those 
                    packages contain drugs or other prohibited substances. For 
                    this reason, many people have ended up in jail. </font></p>

                  <p>If you transport other persons, 
                    you can be confused with a human trafficker, and they can 
                    accuse you of the crime of trafficking or auto theft.</font></p>
                  <p>Do not entrust your minor children

                  <p>To use false documents or those 
                    of another person is a federal crime in the United States, 
                    for which you can be tried in a criminal proceeding and end 
                    up in jail; likewise if you use a false name or say that you 
                    are a citizen of the United States when you are not one. </font></p>

                  <p>If you are facing a criminal 
                    proceeding and you have not yet been sentenced, ask your lawyer 
                    or consular representative about pleading guilty.</font></p>
                  <p>Do not declare yourself guilty 
                    without first consulting your lawyer about the chances of 
                    winning your case. </font></p>
                  <p>It is important that you know 
                    the laws of the state where you live and work since the laws 
                    in each one are different. Consider the following advice:</font></p>
                  <p>If you drink, do not drive, 
                    since if you do not have documents, you can be arrested and 
                    deported.</font></p>
                  <p>If a legal resident is convicted 
                    more than twice for drinking under the influence, he can be 
                    deported. </font></p>
                  <p>Do not drive without a drivers 
                    license.</font></p>
                  <p>Respect traffic laws and use 
                    your seatbelt. </font></p>
                  <p>Do not drive without insurance 
                    and do not agree to drive a stranger&rsquo;s car.</font></p>
                  <p>Do not let strangers into your 
                    car. </font></p>
                  <p>If when driving, you commit 
                    a traffic infraction and you are stopped by the police, place 
                    your hands on the steering wheel and do not get out of the 
                    car until the officer requests that you do so.</font></p>

                  <p>Avoid calling attention to yourself 
                    while you normalize your stay or process your documents to 
                    live in the United States. </font></p>

                  <p>Avoid noisy parties. The neighbors 
                    can get annoyed and call the police, and you can be arrested. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p>Avoid getting involved in fights.</font></p>
                  <p>If you go to a bar or night 
                    club, and a fight starts, leave, since in the confusion you 
                    could be arrested even though you have done anything. </font></p>
                  <p>Avoid family or domestic violence. 
                    As in Mexico, it is a crime in the United States.</font></p>

                  <p>If you are accused of domestic 
                    violence against your children, spouse, or some other person 
                    who lives with you, you could go to jail. In addition, the 
                    Child Protective Service could take away your children.</font></p>
                  <p>Do not carry firearms, knives, 
                    or other dangerous objects.</font></p>
                  <p>Keep in mind that many Mexicans 
                    are dead or in prison for that. </font></p>
                  <p>If the police enter your house 
                    or apartment, do not resist. However, ask for a proper warrant. 
                    It is better to cooperate and to seek to communicate with 
                    the closest Mexican consulate.</font></p>
