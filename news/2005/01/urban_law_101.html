<p><font size="3">I grew up in a suburb of a large northern city, and had no real 
                contact with blacks until I became a lawyer. After I got my law 
                degree I na&iuml;vely looked forward to a rewarding legal career. 
                Little did I realize that 25 years later I would be a self-employed 
                attorney doing domestic and civil litigation for a clientele that 
                is overwhelmingly black. </font></p>
              <p>I didn&rsquo;t plan it that way. 
                I just wanted to do a lot of work in the courtroom, and the best 
                offer I got out of law school was with a small firm that specialized 
                in bankruptcy. Most of its clients were black. Several years later, 
                I set up an independent practice and many of my former clients 
                came to me for domestic work.</font></p>
              <table width="313" align="left">
                <tr> 
                  <td height="309"><img src="/news/2005/01/SCALESsml.JPG" width="276" height="288"></td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>Most people do not realize this, 
                but outside the world of corporate or securities law, in any big 
                city the legal profession is to a large degree fueled by the pathologies 
                of blacks and other Third-World people. Of course, whites hire 
                lawyers, but in any city, especially one with a good-sized black 
                population, most of the people who need lawyers are black. In 
                this respect, lawyers are like police officers or social workers&mdash;they 
                rarely deal with ordinary white people. </font></p>
              <p>To a large degree, I became racially 
                conscious because of my black clients, who eventually destroyed 
                all my preconceived notions about race. My awakening did not come 
                from one or even a few incidents, but from the accumulation of 
                thousands upon thousands of small interactions. </font></p>
              <p>Day after day my clients continue 
                to amaze me. There is no racial education quite so thorough and 
                convincing as spending time with blacks, and my clients are far 
                from being the poorest and least competent blacks. They are not 
                indigent criminals for whom I am a court-appointed lawyer. They 
                are people who can afford (or think they can afford) a lawyer 
                to get a divorce, contest a custody judgment, beat a traffic ticket, 
                etc. Some are government employees who make $60 to $70 thousand 
                a year, yet even this group is vastly different from whites.</font></p>
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p><b>They Don&rsquo;t Know</b></font></p>
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of the most striking things 
                about my black clients is the things they do <i>not</i> know. 
                Many blacks, for example, do not know their own telephone numbers. 
                They may think they do but they don&rsquo;t, and the problem has 
                gotten worse with the proliferation of cell phones. At least a 
                third of the numbers they leave with my receptionist or on my 
                answering machine are wrong numbers. Often, a potential client 
                will call several times, each time leaving a variation of the 
                same phone number. I keep calling until they get it right. At 
                first I thought I was taking down the numbers incorrectly, but 
                now I know better. With caller ID, it is clear when what the client 
                says does not match the digital display. </font></p>
              <p>Some callers don&rsquo;t even leave 
                a number. About a quarter of the messages blacks leave do not 
                include either a name or a number. Needless to say, many calls 
                are not returned.</font></p>
              <p>More than a handful of blacks who 
                have come to my office do not even know their own home address 
                (they move often). Many cannot tell me their own spouse&rsquo;s 
                names. Now I know to tell clients ahead of time that they will 
                need this sort of information when they come in. Otherwise, if 
                I ask for someone&rsquo;s address he may look hurt and say, &#147;If 
                I&rsquo;d known you were going to ask me that I would have come 
                prepared.&#148;</font></p>

              <p>Many black men know their children&rsquo;s 
                names but do not know how to spell them. With the proliferation 
                of unusual names among blacks, I can only guess at how they are 
                spelled. One client who told me he couldn&rsquo;t spell his children&rsquo;s 
                names said I would need an encyclopedia to look them up. Many 
                men have admitted to me they are not even sure how to pronounce 
                their children&rsquo;s names. Black woman, on the other hand, often 
                become incensed if you mispronounce the very unusual names they 
                have given their children.</font></p>
              <p>The most unusual name I ever came 
                across was Iisszzttadda. I have never met a person, white or black, 
                who could pronounce it correctly. To my surprise the name is pronounced, 
                &#147;I seize the day.&#148; Iisszzttadda had siblings named Raheem, 
                Utopian, Desiorme, Sid-Timothy, Kizzma, and Larilaril. I have 
                occasionally asked clients the reasons for such unusual names, 
                but the most common answer is &#147;I don&rsquo;t know. It just 
                sounded good.&#148; This is the answer I got from a mother who 
                named her child Latrine. (See sidebar for actual names of blacks 
                I have encountered in my practice.)</font></p>
              <p>I once had a client in my office 
                who did not know his own name. He had been called by his nickname 
                for so long he couldn&rsquo;t remember his given name. This is 
                not as shocking as it sounds. Some black names, like Phe-anjoy 
                or Quithreaun or JyesahJhnai, are so odd, it would be no surprise 
                if they were never used and eventually forgotten. </font></p>
              <p>Names are not the only things blacks 
                do not know. Once when I was filling out a form for a female client 
                I asked if she knew how old her husband was. She told me she didn&rsquo;t 
                know. I asked her the next question on the form, which was her 
                husband&rsquo;s birth date. Amazingly, she knew it&mdash;and was 
                genuinely surprised when I told her she could figure out her husband&rsquo;s 
                age from his birth date.</font></p>
              <p>When potential clients call for 
                the first time, often the hardest part is to figure out why they 
                are calling. Usually they begin in the middle of the story. If 
                you let them, they will go on and on, and say nothing. Clients 
                may call about papers they got in the mail, but never have the 
                papers in front of them. They may call for information, but never 
                have a pen or pencil ready to take it down. I have learned to 
                ask direct questions: &#147;What is your name?&#148; &#147;What 
                is the problem?&#148; If a client cannot tell me in three minutes 
                or less what the problem is, I tell him to come to my office and 
                bring a small retainer fee. That way at least I will have to listen 
                to their ramblings only if they are prepared to pay.</font></p>
              <p>Blacks with whom I have already 
                spoken seem to think I should know instantly who they are when 
                they telephone. After I get on the line, a typical conversation 
                may go like this: </font></p>
              <p>&#147;Who am I speaking to?&#148;</font></p>
              <p>&#147;I am your client.&#148;</font></p>
              <p>&#147;I have many clients, can you 
                tell me which one?&#148; </font></p>
              <p>&#147;I am your divorce client.&#148;</font></p>
              <p>&#147;Can you tell me your name?&#148;</font></p>
              <p>&#147;Rufus.&#148;</font></p>
              <p>&#147;Rufus, can you tell me your 
                last name?&#148;</font></p>
              <p>The conversation may go on for some 
                time before I finally figure out who is calling.</font></p>
              <p>I do not take personal injury or 
                product liability cases, but blacks are always asking about bringing 
                suits of this kind: &#147;My vacuum cleaner broke. Can you help 
                me?&#148;</font></p>

              <p>Most of my clients who are not black 
                either show up on time for appointments or call if they must reschedule. 
                Amazing as this may seem, only about five percent of my black 
                clients show up on time, and by that I mean within an hour of 
                the appointed time. Only one in five show up on the appointed 
                day. A few trickle in a day or two later. Most just never show 
                up. Missing an appointment never embarrasses black people. They 
                call repeatedly for new appointments, making four, five or even 
                six appointments and then miss them all. I had one client who 
                called more than 50 times before he finally came to my office. 
                Rarely do I ever get a call from a black client <i>canceling </i>an 
                appointment.</font></p>
              <p>When I first started out as a lawyer 
                I would call clients in advance to remind them of their appointments. 
                They thanked me, but it made them no more likely to show up. Also, 
                I used to call clients and potential clients who missed appointments, 
                and try to have them reschedule. This did very little good. The 
                most common response was, &#147;Why are you calling me?&#148; 
                and it was never their fault that they didn&rsquo;t show up. They 
                had many different excuses, but I never heard, &#147;I forgot,&#148; 
                or &#147;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t make it.&#148;</font></p>
              <p>Since appointments mean so little 
                to my clients, I decide each day when I am available, and tell 
                everyone to show up at the same time. On Saturday afternoons I 
                can have as many as twenty appointments for the same time. Usually 
                it is not a problem because few show up and even fewer show up 
                on time. Only once in the last 20 years did everyone show up.

              <p>Many of my clients are unable to 
                explain even the most basic facts. Often they must take the witness 
                stand, and no matter how many times we have gone over the testimony 
                in advance, I can be surprised by what they say. Some are simply 
                lying and get tangled up in their lies, but most have such low 
                IQs, they cannot describe even the simplest things. Often they 
                seem to say the first thing that pops into their heads. When they 
                are questioned further they cannot remember what they said previously.

              <p>I once had a client whose wife was 
                suing him for child support. In discussions before trial he told 
                me he had two children from a previous marriage. This was favorable 
                for him because it meant he would probably owe his current wife 
                less money. At trial, his wife testified that my client had no 
                children outside of their marriage. When I asked him on the stand 
                how many children he had before he married his current wife, he 
                said he had none. Later I asked him why he had answered that way, 
                when he told me before that he had two other children. &#147;Did 
                I say that?&#148; he asked. I never found out which version was 
                true.</font></p>

              <p>Many of my clients have a hard time 
                following simple directions. Once I appeared in traffic court 
                with a client. In lieu of a conviction he was to see a traffic 
                safety movie. The courtroom was on the second floor of the courthouse, 
                and the traffic safety movie was shown on the first floor. The 
                client was to come back to the courtroom with proof&mdash;which 
                would be given him on the first floor&mdash;that he watched the 
                movie. Both the judge and I explained this to the client. At the 
                designated hour my client did not come back to the courtroom. 
                Later that afternoon I got a call from the judge, who told me 
                my client had completely misunderstood the instructions. He went 
                to the nearest commercial movie house, saw a movie, and brought 
                back his movie ticket stub. </font></p>
              <p>Long ago I stopped asking my clients 
                why they did something. It is not worth the effort. Most don&rsquo;t 
                know. The ones who know usually cannot give a coherent answer. 
                Even if they can give a coherent answer, it usually changes every 
                time you ask.</font></p>
              <p>For example, one of my black divorce 
                clients tried to hide assets from his spouse&mdash;this is not 
                uncommon. Through discovery it came to light that he had secretly 
                bought a piece of property after the divorce had begun. He put 
                his wife&rsquo;s name on the title, a very odd thing to do, since 
                he was trying to hide the property from her. I made the mistake 
                of asking him why he did that. True to my previous experiences, 
                he could not give an answer that made sense. </font></p>
              <p>Clients sometimes tell me they knew 
                they were being cheated, but signed the papers anyway. I have 
                given up asking why they signed, because I know I will not get 
                an intelligible answer.</font></p>
              <p>My clients make mistakes in written 
                and spoken English that are often comical. One client in a criminal 
                case told me he was telling the truth, and was willing to take 
                a &#147;polyester test&#148; to prove it. Another told me he desperately 
                wanted to see me, and needed an appointment &#147;between Tuesday 
                and Wednesday.&#148; One who bounced a check told me the problem 
                was &#147;insignificant funds&#148; in his account. I have had 
                clients who have &#147;profiteering&#148; plans at work, want 
                an &#147;uncontestable&#148; divorce (or a &#147;detested&#148; 
                divorce, or an &#147;untested&#148; divorce), had &#147;insects&#148; 
                (incest) in the family, need an &#147;annoyment&#148; (annulment), 
                want a free &#147;flirtation&#148; (consultation), ask about my 
                &#147;container&#148; (retainer), want to &#147;consultate&#148; 
                about a divorce, or had to meet with &#147;media people&#148; 
                (mediation counselors). One man told me, &#147;I own a car but 
                it is not mine,&#148; and one who was accused of indecent exposure 
                insisted, &#147;I didn&rsquo;t take my stuff out of my pants.&#148;</font></p>
              <p>It took me some time to understand 
                certain kinds of black slang. Within the first month of my independent 
                practice a man called to ask if I could &#147;put a suitcase on 
                a cat.&#148; After much inquiry I realized he wanted to know if 
                I could file a law suit against someone. Within the week I got 
                another call asking if I &#147;did luggage.&#148; Since I now 
                knew about suitcases, I said yes, I do luggage.</font></p>
              <p>I pride myself on doing good work 
                for my clients, but I cannot remember <i>even once</i> being thanked 
                or complimented by a black client. They do not observe even the 
                most common courtesies. Also, with rare exceptions, blacks will 
                never admit they made a mistake. When things go wrong, as they 
                inevitably do, it is always someone else&rsquo;s fault. The most 
                common excuse blacks give is, &#147;They are putting me through 
                the changes.&#148; I have yet to figure out exactly what that 
                means.</font></p>
              <p>Most people tell lies because they 
                think a lie will help them. I have come to the conclusion that 
                most of my clients cannot distinguish between a plausible lie 
                and a wild fairy tale. They<b> </b>are convinced people will believe 
                anything they say. Clients often tell me some fantastic story 
                I cannot possibly defend in court. If I tell them what they are 
                saying is unbelievable the usual reaction is anger and screaming. 
                Typically, they will add, &#147;I&rsquo;m paying you. You have 
                to believe what I say.&#148;</font></p>

              <p>Sometimes, despite my warnings, 
                clients will get on the stand and tell obvious, outright lies. 
                The judge may interrupt the testimony and tell me to go outside 
                with my client to &#147;get your story straight.&#148; They are 
                not going to sit in court and listen to fairy tales. I take my 
                client outside and tell him he has got to tell the truth, or at 
                least say something believable. My client then starts screaming. 
                &#147;Why are you talking to me this way? You&rsquo;re supposed 
                to be on my side.&#148;</font></p>
              <div align="left"></div>
              <p>I once had a client testify about 
                his assets in a divorce case, in which the court was to determine 
                whether he should pay his estranged wife temporary support. My 
                client was a store-front preacher, and testified that he lived 
                in the marital residence with his wife, though in separate quarters. 
                His wife testified that he was out living with his &#147;ho.&#148; 
                My client went on and on about how this was impossible because 
                he was a Man of God. I thought he was lying. The judge ruled that 
                if my client was living with his wife he should share household 
                expenses, which he was not currently paying. At this point, my 
                client realized there was a cost to pretending to be a Man of 
                God living with his lawful wife, and changed his tune. &#147;Judge 
                why are you believing me?&#148; he said. &#147;Believe my wife. 
                I am nothing but an old lying nigger.&#148; No one in the courtroom 
                could stop laughing.</font></p>

              <p> &#147;Outside kid&#148; cases are 
                one of my specialties. For those not in the know, blacks call 
                any child born out of wedlock an outside kid. Black men are good 
                at making children but not at supporting them, and this can be 
                a terrible burden under laws written with white people in mind.</font></p>

              <p>In my state, the parent who does 
                not have custody&mdash;almost always the father&mdash;pays a percentage 
                of net income to the parent with custody&mdash;almost always the 
                mother. The mother gets 20 percent of the father&rsquo;s net income 
                for the first child, 25 percent for two children, and up to 50 
                percent for five or more children. What if a man has children 
                by several women? <i>Each</i> mother gets 20 percent for the first 
                child, so a man with five children by five different women is 
                supposed to be paying <i>100 percent</i> of his income in child 
                support. I once had a client who had 12 different children by 
                10 different women. Theoretically, he owed <i>250 percent</i> 
                of his income. These laws simply don&rsquo;t make sense for blacks. 
                Judges have to decide each case as best they can.</font></p>
              <p>Not surprisingly, the average black 
                client will not pay child support unless it is deducted from his 
                paycheck. Many refuse to work, or leave a job to avoid paying. 
                Job turnover is very high among blacks, and the court system has 
                a hard time keeping up with them. Some blacks quit on purpose, 
                and move to another job so as to keep one step ahead of the collections. 
                </font></p>
              <p>Whenever I ask a potential client 
                whether he has paid court-ordered child support he will almost 
                invariably answer with one or more of the following: &#147;I always 
                helps my kids.&#148; &#147;I gives the mother money whenever she 
                asks.&#148; &#147;I am always there for my kids.&#148; &#147;I 
                buys my kids whatever they needs.&#148; It almost always turns 
                out they have paid no support, haven&rsquo;t seen their children 
                in years, and at best may have paid for some basketball shoes.

              <p>Children do not always seem to have 
                the same importance for blacks that they do for whites. I was 
                in bankruptcy court once waiting for my client&rsquo;s case to 
                be called. A black debtor&mdash;not my client&mdash;was before the 
                judge trying to convince him to approve his bankruptcy repayment 
                plan. The judge told him he could not afford both his Cadillac 
                and his children, and had to give up one or the other. The debtor 
                immediately said he could not give up his car, and therefore the 
                judge would have to take his kids. The judge threw up his hands 
                and walked off the bench. On another occasion, the same bankruptcy 
                judge told a black debtor he could not afford both his Cadillac 
                and his house. The debtor replied, &#147;You can live in your 
                car but you can&rsquo;t drive your house. Take my house.&#148; 
                This was many years ago and tastes in cars may have changed, but 
                I learned how important Cadillacs were to blacks.</font></p>
              <p>In one respect my job is very different 
                from that of a policeman or social worker: I have to make sure 
                I am paid. I try to get paid in full before I agree to represent 
                a client. If I am not paid in full before the case is over I know 
                I will never get any more money. Clients have a hard time understanding 
                they are paying for an attorney&rsquo;s time. Invariably, if a 
                client drops a case before it is over he asks for a full refund. 
                Their reasoning goes something like this: &#147;I paid for a divorce 
                and I didn&rsquo;t get one, so I should get all my money back.&#148;</font></p>
              <div align="left"></div>
              <p>Once I sued a client who didn&rsquo;t 
                pay me. I finally garnished his wages and was paid in full. About 
                six months later he called to ask me to take his next case. I 
                told him I didn&rsquo;t want a client that doesn&rsquo;t pay his 
                bills. He became indignant. He said I got all my money, so what 
                did I have to complain about. </font></p>
              <p>To hear my clients tell it, banks 
                are constantly &#147;messing&#148; with their checking accounts. 
                At least that is what they tell me when their checks bounce. Most 
                of my clients do not have checking accounts, and pay cash. The 
                ones who do have accounts have no idea how much money is in them. 
                Many clients have written me checks on accounts that were closed. 
                </font></p>
              <p>Black clients yell and scream at 
                me every day; I have learned that this is normal. They are like 
                young children who don&rsquo;t get their way. I usually ignore 
                these outbursts, though screaming back at them is usually more 
                effective. I have been threatened with physical violence only 
                twice, and once I had to call the police to escort a client out 
                of my office. </font></p>
              <p>My experience is hardly unique. 
                Most of the lawyers I know have practices similar to mine. Most 
                lawyers therefore are racial realists even if they do not admit 
                it openly. Their actions and comments are no different from mine. 
                People who have daily contact with minorities, who know first-hand 
                that there are racial differences, are likely to be the best prospects 
                for any movement that promotes racial consciousness. They don&rsquo;t 
                like dealing with blacks, but that is simply part of the business. 
                If they can&rsquo;t take it anymore they get into some other line 
                of work. </font></p>

              <p>One lawyer I know moved to the country 
                so he would have white clients. He had lived in the big city all 
                his live, but was willing to pull up all his roots to get a different 
                clientele.</font></p>
              <p>Recently the supreme court in my 
                state ruled that a lawyer can be disciplined for communications 
                that racially denigrate litigants. For that reason I cannot write

  <font size="3"><p>    Oh, this was howlingly funny and howlingly true.  As a former social worker in Atlanta, I know exactly what this guy is talking about.  Anytime you request anyone black to show proof of <span class="caps">ANYTHING, </span>you are &#8220;putting them through changes&#8221;.  No one, apparently, is <span class="caps">EVER </span>to ask anyone black to have to prove anything to anyone to get anything free and taxpayer paid.  They are just entitled to it.  Period.  </p>
<p>     And the names  &mdash;  oh, how true, again.  I, too, kept a file of names, and they are mostly hilarious and sad at the same time.  I had a client with the last name of Love.  Her children were Baby, Precious, and D&rsquo;wanna (as in &#8220;do you wanna?&#8221;).  The truly saddest name though was a little girl who had been named &#8220;Sexley&#8221; by her stupid mother.</p>
<p>     Now, after having said all of the above, we all know that this lawyer <span class="caps">MUST </span>be a racist.  I mean, how could this be true?  He must be making this up&hellip;.</p>
<p>     Of course, blacks <span class="caps">KNOW </span>this about themselves.  They know all this stuff.  They just don&rsquo;t like white people to know it and point it out.      </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>This article is a classic, and at the least funny. One can&rsquo;t read this story and think of the line in the book &#8220;The Killer Angels&#8221; when southern whites were told by northerners that blacks were equal to them; &#8220;but have you every really  dealt with them?&#8221; <br>
His comments ring true with anyone who has had extended dealings with blacks.&#8221;My awakening did not come from one or even a few incidents, but from the accumulation of thousands upon thousands of small interactions. </p>
<p>Day after day my clients continue to amaze me. There is no racial education quite so thorough and convincing as spending time with blacks, and my clients are far from being the poorest and least competent blacks. They are not indigent criminals for whom I am a court-appointed lawyer. They are people who can afford (or think they can afford) a lawyer to get a divorce, contest a custody judgment, beat a traffic ticket, etc. Some are government employees who make $60 to $70 thousand a year, yet even this group is vastly different from whites.&#8221;</p>

  <font size="3"><p>This was a great article. I believe that the only real chance we have of getting Whites to be racially aware is to have Whites live and work in Black and other non White environments. Notice that this White lawyer wasn&rsquo;t raped or killed in all his contact with Blacks, neither will you if you know how to handle yourself. Blacks can be very, very racist and violent, but they are easy to read. After being around them long enough you will develop &#8220;spiderman&#8221; type sense to feel when something isn&rsquo;t right, something is about to go wrong. Only a newbie, White suburbanite gets caught unprepared in a Black race riot. The rest of us will know the score and take precautions.</p>
<p>One last point. Blacks can be very entertaining and it is often tough for Whites who have lived lives of danger and excitement around urban Blacks to adjust to live around exclusively boring, all Whites. I have had that problem.  And after living a life of terror amongst urban Blacks, don&rsquo;t try to go work for some White Republican like Orin Hatch or Dick Luger or Libby Dole to try to address the problems of Lasheeta and Esamaj (That&rsquo;s &#8220;James&#8221; spelled backwards). These <span class="caps">GOP</span> White Republicans probably have a better idea about what Martians are like than they do about our urban Blacks.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>  One of the worst things about blacks is:<br>
behavior in the business world, they don&rsquo;t know how to act in or work in a business, therefore once again, they sabotage the American economy.<br><br>
  As this gentleman states in his law experience about black incomprehension, the ignorance is repeated when the black either works for someone, or goes into a business. In other words, they can&rsquo;t even go into a convenience store correctly, on the rare occasion they go in not to rob it.<br><br>
  They used to have like Business 101 in high schools, such as how to write a letter, and how supply and demand works; one can only assume that the time devoted to that is now spent on teaching the blacks about the negro who invented that comb blacks stick in their hair. Really, somebody told me that her daughter had to spend two days learning about the life of the black who invented that stupid comb.<br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>An excellent article. Some people might dismiss such first-hand accounts as mere subjective anectdotes, but I find there is simply no substitute for the reality of personal experiences told honestly in a forum such as this, where free speech still remains. Notice how there are no &#8220;Black Ph.D&#8221;s, nor &#8220;Black architects&#8221; or self-appointed &#8220;Reverends&#8221; posting comments to attempt to contradict the findings in this article. We all know why, of course. It&rsquo;s like a pungent breeze encountering a very solid brick wall. The truth is the wall. The pungent breeze is the voice of the black community. Eventually its &#8220;fragrance&#8221; will fade, but the truth will still stand. And we will stand as well.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>This article was funny and all too true.  I work in customer service and every day I encounter the difference between black and white customers on the phone.  White customers may on occasion be rude or even not too bright, but at least they have a definite message as to why they called; invariably, black customers are inarticulate. <br>
Their sentences are inerspersed with &#8220;&hellip;ummmm&#8221; and &#8220;uhhhhh&#8221; and, yes, they often don&rsquo;t know their own phone numbers.<br><br>
Years ago when my sister was waitressing to put herself through college, she was incredulous that no matter what their bill came to for a meal, blacks never left more than a dollar as a tip.  The bill could be $3.00 or $75, but the tip was always $1.<br><br>
She seemed to think it was because they couldn&rsquo;t figure out percents.  <br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>It is funny, how some of these articles jolt the memory, if you have ever worked with, or lived in close proximity with blacks. For example, about 12 years ago while in grad school, my primary place of employment was a house wares store. Black customers tended to be quite trying to say the least. Mind you, I was only a clerk/cashier; however, to the average black shopper I &ldquo;be the rich owner&rdquo; of the place. How this assumption was made, I do not know? I have long guessed it was simply because I had to wear a white shirt with a necktie and was a white man. They would sometimes make remarks along that train of thought: &lsquo;you in a tie, you own the place right?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, as I &ldquo;be the rich owner&rdquo; by assumption, I was often expected to have any kitchen appliance they needed, no matter how vague and odd the description. The conversation I remember most vividly was with a well dressed black man (BM,) it went like this:</p>
<p><span class="caps">BM, </span>&ldquo;hey you, you got one of those things I need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John <span class="caps">PM, </span>&ldquo;we have many kitchen supplies here, what is the item you are looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="caps">BM, </span>looking wildly around the shop, &ldquo;you know, one of those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John <span class="caps">PM, </span>&ldquo;Do you mean an electric skillet, a wooden spoon, a coffee maker, a mixer&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="caps">BM, </span>head snapping into place and face splitting into a big stupid grin, &ldquo;yeah, that&rsquo;s it, one of those things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John <span class="caps">PM, </span>&ldquo;which one of the &lsquo;things&rsquo; that I mentioned are you looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="caps">BM, </span>puffing up and scowling in anger, &ldquo;you f***ing with me, I&rsquo;m on my lunch break, I aint got time to be f***ed with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another incident that pops to mind, from my first office job straight out of college, involves a young female coworker of color who walked into our employer&rsquo;s office on a Saturday morning (we were getting overtime, during the opening of a local branch office) and sat down at her desk, a few over from mine. She belched very loudly, gagged and then vomited into her wastebasket. Looking around briskly and laughing, she settled into her desk and picked up her telephone as if nothing had happened. Disgusted and not believing what had just happened, I returned to what I was working on. Next, I am subjected to an odd snoring sound. As you might guess, I look up and over to see that the coworker is sprawled out cold in her seat sawing logs. Laughing in stunned contempt, I see the supervisor rushing ashen faced to her desk. The supervisor stops and looking mortified at the drunken sleeping fool, stammers something like, &lsquo;she called to ask if she could leave to go home and just stopped talking in mid-sentence, she just dropped her phone.&rsquo;  Needless to say, she got to go home permanently!</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Miss Falkner:</p>
<p>What part of this article has anything to do with hatred? This writer injected very little of his own opinion into the piece. All he did was describe his experiences as a lawyer in an urban black area. If truthful descriptions (which these very definitely are, as any honest person would have to agree) of life around and among blacks constitute &#8220;hatred,&#8221; then I suppose it is hatred. </p>
<p>What is really happening here is that you, like so many others in today&rsquo;s world, have been brainwashed into thinking that all groups of people are the same. When you come across anything that defies this belief of yours, you call it &#8220;hatred.&#8221; You weren&rsquo;t able to dispute any of the facts in Williamson&rsquo;s article, nor any of the conclusions. This is because when someone like Williamson happens to speak a truth that someone like you doesn&rsquo;t like, you cannot respond in terms of truth. All you can do is label and malign, though you did refrain from any attack on the author&rsquo;s character, which is actually commendable considering the times in which we live.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that blacks do not have a monopoly on trashiness and other similar attributes. There is no doubt that many whites share many of the characteristics of the blacks in this article. It&rsquo;s also true that these characteristics are overwhelmingly due to <span class="caps">IQ.</span> What &#8220;trashy&#8221; whites and so many blacks have in common is low <span class="caps">IQ.</span></p>
<p>This an important point because low intelligence, which we can see empirically and anecdotally in this article, is much more common in blacks than whites. Because of this lower (average) intelligence, one will always see a far higher proportion of blacks than whites with low intelligence. You should take a look at the abridged version of P. Rushton&rsquo;s book &#8220;Race, Intelligence, and Behavior,&#8221; which discusses other empirical evidence of low African <span class="caps">IQ. </span>(The posters who mentioned blacks and tipping in restaurants should see Rushton&rsquo;s writing on the subject of race and altruism. I have discussed this with many people, including blacks, and all these discussion indicate that blacks do not tip nearly [frequently not at all] as well as whites. Rushton&rsquo;s work on this point is hard to ignore.)</p>
<p>The point that most impressed me, and one that I as a student of Islamic history can personally attest to the veracity of, is the Arab attitude in the 7-8th centuries to the Africans they encountered along the continent&rsquo;s east coast. Rushton points out that these attitudes are virtually identical to the ones expressed by the European explorers and colonizers twelve centuries later. This isn&rsquo;t white racism; low black average IQ has been, and is, right there in front of everyone&rsquo;s face. The sole difference between a race-realist and a race-dogmatist is that the realist accepts what he sees; the dogmatist does not.</p>
<p>Eventually, the gene or genes that control intelligence will be identified and no one, not even the most dogmatic race-denier, will be able to dispute the lower average intelligence of blacks. (And incidentally, the higher average IQs of North Asians. As J. Taylor has said, &#8220;Let the chips fall where they may.&#8221;) This doesn&rsquo;t preclude the possibility of there being blacks with very high intelligence (we all know of a few), but means only that such people will be far rarer among blacks than among Asians or whites.</p>
<p>What you should do is keep an open mind and a constant awareness of the reality of race. </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Donald Williamson has performed a valuable public service by publishing his article on &#8220;Urban Law 101.&#8221; As I was formerly engaged in the practice of law, I can verify the truthfulness of many of his statements.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that editorial considerations as to the length of the article prohibited Williamson from discussing the tragic results of permitting blacks to hold civil service positions in government offices, including clerical positions within the court system. In the metropolitan area, case files are often lost or misplaced, court documents are misfiled and endless delays are the result. Simple tasks take hours to perform, the costs of litigation are inflated due to simple incompetence. Multiple court appearances are needed to complete the most routine tasks. </p>
<p>Additionally, civil rights activists have pressed to increase minority representation in the judiciary. This is the equivalent of asking the blind to lead the blind. Black jurists have been impeached for sexually harassing their own court clerks and government attorneys assigned to their courtrooms, disciplined or sued for not paying their bills and child support, sanctioned for engaging in partisan politics while in judicial office, etc. In legal slang, the local circuit court is derisively referred to as &#8220;the circus court.&#8221; Many black politicians appear to be immune from scandals that would ruin the careers of white officeholders.</p>
<p>Court calls in the outlying counties are orderly. In the city, however, absolute chaos is the order of the day. Our court house has been turned into a slaughter house.   </p></font><p>Posted

As a member of our armed forces, a grocery store clerk, and a former student of an integrated city school in Indianapolis, I have observed similar behavior over and over again.  Isn&rsquo;t it obvious?  There is nothing &#8220;hateful&#8221; about this article; just plain observation.</p>
<p>If anything is to be learned, it is that poor white children should not be forced to sit in a classroom with black students - they invariable slow the pace down and denigrate the education of the white students.  I am now at a disadvantage at college because my white peers, who attended private high schools or what I like to call &#8220;private public schools,&#8221; have a leg up on me.  Perhaps not in the long run, though; the ways of the blacks have rubbed off on me and may aid me one day in my career - if not saving my life. </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>This article was entertaining enough, but as an attorney I find it very hard to empathize with the author very much at all.  It really took him 25 years to figure this out?  Even the most self-delusional liberal is usually willing to at least convert the issue of &#8220;white areas vs. black areas&#8221; into one of &#8220;wealthy areas vs. poverty-stricken ones,&#8221; etc.  And in a large city with corresponding white suburban areas that typically donut around the outskirts, it&rsquo;s not as if one has to completely uproot themselves from the ghetto and move all the way out to Green Acres just to get away from the minorities.</p>
<p>On another note, when I do receive phone calls from potential (or current) clients who begin speaking in typical ghetto/ebonic slang, I cut them off immediately and tell them that I only speak one language, which is English, and if they expect me to understand what they&rsquo;re saying then they will have speak in English, or call someone else to represent them.  You&rsquo;d be amazed at how many of them, instead of getting angry and yelling or hanging up, immediately change their tune and speak in a clear, intelligible (enough), and respectful manner.  Most blacks are actually bi-lingual (ebonics &amp; English), and whites just don&rsquo;t know it.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>An amazingly funny article.  While I suspect that many of the incedents described in it have been exagerated a bit to the sake of humor, recall that all good humor has a basis in the truth.</p>
<p>One thing that has always angered me about minorities and their leftist allies is how quick they are to describe racialists (and anyone else who is racially aware) as being somehow &#8220;ignorant&#8221;.  In doing so they imply that if the racialist actually knew the subject of his scorn he would not hold the opinions that he does.  This is far from the truth and is simply an ego-stroking exercise on the part of the minority&rsquo;s.  Articles like this prove that racism/racialism/racial awareness are almost never the product of ignorance but are usually caused by life expereince.</p>
<p>This myth of the &#8220;ignorance&#8221; of racially aware people is aided by two other factors. First in today&rsquo;s PC world a racialist world view can adversly effect your future if your views are known.  Therefore most racialist with a future worth protecting tend to keep their mouth shut.  Thus most people who buy into the &#8220;ignorance myth&#8221; have never actually met an overt racist.  The leftwing press in this country feeds this myth by their unfair treatment of racialist.  One only has to look so far as the &#8220;Jerry Springer show&#8221; and it&rsquo;s charicatures of racists to see what the popular media-fed misconception is.</p>
<p>The answer is to show well thought out racially aware articles like this to your fence sitting friends.  Fight back against the &#8220;ignorant&#8221; stereotype!<br>

<p>Growing up in Gary Indiana, I saw the crime and decay that accompanies a black majority.

In Hawaii (well, the Polynesians are pretty similar to the Blacks), I heard names like &#8220;Jello&#8221;, &#8220;Refrigerator&#8221; &#8220;Wilma&#8221; (mother) and (daughter) &#8220;Pebbles&#8221; and a family whose last name was Silva, named their kids &#8220;Hi-Ho&#8221;, &#8220;Quick&#8221; and &#8220;Sterling&#8221;-you know, Silva!</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>    how true. the skinny on tort reform is this-when a certain group of people got their civil rights, one of the civil rights they got was the right to serve on juries, and american law has never been the same since.  all of the so-called &#8220;jackpot  justice&#8221; venues have one thing in common-all have an extraordinarily high percentage of blacks in the jury pool, and blacks see the civil justice system as a way to redistribute income.  how does our ruling elite respond? keep blacks from serving on juries?- no, they&rsquo;ve decided to take rights away from all of us via &#8220;tort reform&#8221;.</p></font><p>Posted
