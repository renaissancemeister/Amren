						<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On August 2, 1983, the U.S. House
of Representatives passed a bill creating a legal public holiday in honor
of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Although there had been little discussion
of the bill in the House itself and little awareness among the American
public that Congress was even considering such a bill, it was immediately
clear that the U.S. Senate would take up the legislation soon after the
Labor Day recess. The House had passed the King Holiday Bill by an overwhelming
vote of 338-90, with significant bipartisan support (both Reps. Jack Kemp
and Newt Gingrich voted for it), and the Reagan administration was indicating
that the President would not veto it if it came before him. In these circumstances,
most political observers seemed to think that Senate enactment and presidential
signature of the bill would take place virtually unopposed; few anticipated
that the battle over the King holiday in the next few weeks would be one
of the most bitter congressional and public controversies of the decade.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From 1981 to 1986 I worked on the
staff of North Carolina Republican Sen. John P. East, a close associate
and political ally of the senior senator from North Carolina, Jesse Helms.&nbsp;</font>
<table align="RIGHT" cellpadding="7" cols="1" width="210">

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">It was not originally

</td>

</table>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the legislation was being considered
I
wrote a paper entitled &ldquo;Martin Luther King, Jr.: Political Activities and
Associations.&rdquo; It was simply documentation of the affiliations with various
individuals and organizations of communist background that King had maintained
since the days when he first became a nationally prominent figure. In September,
the paper was distributed to several Senate offices for the purpose of
informing them of these facts about King, facts in which the national news
media showed no interest. It was not originally my intention that the paper
be read on the floor of the Senate, but the Helms office itself expressed
an interest in using it as a speech, and it was read into the <i>Congressional
Record</i> on October 3, 1983. During the ensuing debate over the King
holiday, I acted as a consultant to Sen. Helms and his regular staff.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sen. Helms, like Sen. East and many
other conservatives in the Senate and the country, was strongly opposed
to establishing a national holiday for King. The country already observed
no fewer than nine legal public holidays – New Years Day, &ldquo;President&rsquo;s
Day&rdquo; as it is officially known or &ldquo;Washington&rsquo;s Birthday&rdquo; as an unreconstructed
American public continues to insist on calling it, Memorial Day, Independence
Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Columbus Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
With the exceptions of Washington&rsquo;s Birthday and Christmas, not a one of
these holidays celebrates a single individual. As Sen. East argued, to
establish a special holiday just for King was to</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;elevate him to the same
level as the father of our country and above the many other Americans whose
achievements approach Washington&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whatever King&rsquo;s own accomplishments,
few would go so far as to claim that they equaled or exceeded those of
many other major statesmen, soldiers, and creative minds of American history.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That argument alone should have provided
a compelling reason to reject the King holiday, but for some years a well-organized
and powerful lobby had pressured Congress for its enactment, and anyone
who questioned the need for the holiday was likely to be accused of &ldquo;racism&rdquo;
or &ldquo;insensitivity.&rdquo; Congressional Democrats, always eager to court the
black voting bloc that has become their party&rsquo;s principal mainstay, were
solidly in favor of it (the major exception being Georgia Democrat Larry
McDonald, who led the opposition to the measure in the House and who died
before the month was over when a Soviet warplane shot down the civilian
airliner on which he and nearly three hundred other civilians were traveling).
Republicans, always timid about accusations of racial insensitivity and
eager to court the black vote themselves, were almost as supportive of
the proposal as the Democrats. Few lawmakers stopped to consider the deeper
cultural and political impact a King holiday would have, and few journalists
and opinion-makers encouraged them to consider it. Instead, almost all
of them –&nbsp; lawmakers and opinion-makers – devoted their energies to
vilifying the only public leader who displayed the courage to question
the very premise of the proposal – whether Martin Luther King was himself
worthy of the immense and unprecedented honor being placed upon him.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It soon became clear that whatever
objections might be raised against the holiday, no one in politics or the
media wanted to hear about them and that even the Republican leadership
of the Senate was sympathetic to passage of the legislation. When the Senate
Majority Leader, Howard Baker, scheduled action to consider the bill soon
after Congress returned from the Labor Day recess, King&rsquo;s widow, Coretta
Scott King, called Sen. Baker and urged him to postpone action in order
to gain time to gather more support for the bill. The senator readily agreed,
telling the press,</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;She felt chances for passage
would be enhanced and improved if it were postponed. The postponement of
this is not for the purpose of delay.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nevertheless, despite the support for
the bill from the Republican leadership itself, the vote was delayed again,
mainly because of the efforts of Sen. Helms.</font>

</table>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sen. Helms delivered his speech on
King on October 3 and later supplemented it with a document of some 300
pages consisting mainly of declassified FBI and other government reports
about King&rsquo;s connections with communists and communist-influenced groups
that the speech recounted. That document, distributed on the desks of all
senators, was promptly characterized as</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;a packet of filth&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">by New York&rsquo;s Democratic Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, who threw it to the floor of the Senate and stomped on
it (he later repeated his stomping off the Senate floor for the benefit
of the evening news), while Sen. Edward Kennedy denounced the Helms speech
as</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;Red smear tactics&rdquo; that
should be &ldquo;shunned by the American people.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">A few days later, columnist Edwin M.
Yoder, Jr. in the <i>Washington Post</i> sneered that Jesse Helms</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;is a stopped clock if ever
American politics had one&rdquo; who could be depended on to &ldquo;contaminate a serious
argument with debating points from the gutter,&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">while he described King as</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;a prophet, a man of good
works, a thoroughly wholesome influence in American life.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Writing in the <i>Washington Times</i>,
conservative Aram Bakshian held that Sen. Helms was simply politically
motivated:</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;He has nothing to lose
and everything to gain by heaping scorn on the memory of Martin Luther
King and thereby titillating the great white trash.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Leftist Richard Cohen wrote of Helms
in the <i>Post</i>,</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;His sincerity is not in
question. Only his decency.&rdquo;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Meanwhile, Sen. Helms, with legal assistance
from the Conservative Caucus, filed suit in federal court to obtain the
release of FBI surveillance tapes on King that had been sealed by court
order until the year 2027. Their argument was that senators could not fairly
evaluate King&rsquo;s character and beliefs and cast an informed vote on the
holiday measure until they had gained access to this sealed material and
had an opportunity to examine it. The Reagan Justice Department opposed
this action, and on October 18, U.S. District Judge John Lewis Smith, Jr.
refused to release the King files, which remain sealed to this day.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Efforts to send the bill to committee
also failed. Although it is a routine practice for the Senate to refer
all legislation to committee, where hearings can consider the merits of
the proposed law, this was not done in the case of the King holiday bill.
Sen. Kennedy, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, argued
that hearings on a similar proposal had been held in a previous Congress
and there was no need to hold new hearings. He was correct that hearings
had been held, but there had been considerable turnover in the Senate since
then and copies of those hearings were not generally available. Nevertheless,
it soon became clear that Republicans and Democrats, liberals and many
conservatives, the White House, the courts, and the media all wanted the
King holiday bill passed as soon as possible, with as little serious discussion
of King&rsquo;s character, beliefs, and associations as possible.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Why this was so was becoming increasingly
clear to me as an observer of the process. Our office soon began to receive
phone calls and letters from all over the country expressing strong popular
opposition to the bill. Aides from other Senate offices – I specifically
remember one from Washington state and one from Pennsylvania – told me
their mail from constituents was running overwhelmingly against the bill,
and I recall overhearing Sen. Robert Dole telling a colleague that he had
to go back to Kansas and prove he was still a Republican despite his support
for the King holiday bill. The political leaders of both parties were beginning
to grasp that they were sitting on top of a potential political earthquake,
which they wanted to stifle before it swallowed them all.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On October 19, then, the vote was
held, 78 in favor of the holiday and 22 against (37 Republicans and 41
Democrats voted for the bill; 18 Republicans and 4 Democrats voted against
it); several substitute amendments intended to replace the King holiday
measure were defeated without significant debate. President Reagan signed
the bill into law on November 2nd. I distinctly remember standing with
Sen. Helms in the Republican cloakroom just off the floor of the Senate
during the debate, listening to one senator after another approaching him
to apologize for the insulting language they had just used about Sen. Helms
on the floor. Not a few of the senators assured him they knew he was right
about King but what else could they do but denounce Helms and vote for
the holiday? Most of them claimed political expediency as their excuse,
and I recall one Senate aide chortling that</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;what old Jesse needs to
do is get back to North Carolina and try to save his own neck&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">from the coming disaster he had prepared
for himself in opposing the King holiday.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Indeed, it was conventional wisdom
in Washington at that time that Jesse Helms had committed political suicide
by his opposition to the King holiday and that he was certain to lose re-election
the following year against a challenge by Democratic Governor James B.
Hunt. In fact, Sen. Helms was trailing in the polls prior to the controversy
over the holiday. The <i>Washington Post</i> carried a story shortly after
the vote on the holiday bill with the headline,</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;Battle to Block King Holiday
May Have Hurt Helms at Home,&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">and a former political reporter from
North Carolina confidently gloated in the Post on October 23 that Helms
was</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;Destined to Lose in &lsquo;84.&rdquo;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the event, of course, Sen. Helms
was re-elected by a healthy margin, and the Post itself acknowledged the
role of his opposition to the King Holiday as a major factor in his political
revival. As Post reporter Bill Peterson wrote in news stories after Helms&rsquo;
re-election on November 6, 1984, his</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;standing among whites .
. . shot up in polls after he led a filibuster [strong opposition] against
a bill establishing a national holiday on the birthday of the late Rev.
Martin Luther King, Jr.,&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">and on November 18,</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;A poll before the filibuster
showed Helms trailing Hunt by 20 percentage points. By December, Hunt&rsquo;s
lead was sliced in half. White voters who had been feeling doubts about
Helms began returning to the fold.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">If Sen. Helms&rsquo; speech against the King
holiday had any enduring effect, then, it was to help re-elect him to the
Senate.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So, was Jesse Helms right about Martin
Luther King? That King had close connections with individuals and groups
that were openly communist is clear today, as it was clear during King&rsquo;s
own lifetime and during the debate on the holiday bill. Indeed, only two
weeks after the Senate vote, on November 1, 1983, the <i>New York Times
</i>published
a letter written by Michael Parenti, an associate fellow of the far-left
Institute for Policy Studies in Washington and a frequent contributor to
<i>Political
Affairs</i>, an official organ of the Communist Party that styles itself
the &ldquo;Theoretical Journal of the Communist Party, U.S.A.&rdquo; The letter demanded
&ldquo;What if communists had links to Dr. King?&rdquo; Mr. Parenti pointed out that&nbsp;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;The three areas in which
King was most active – civil rights, peace and the labor struggle (the
latter two toward the end of his life) – are also areas in which U.S. Communists
have worked long and devotedly,&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">and he criticized &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; who &ldquo;once
again accept the McCarthyite premise that U.S. Communists are purveyors
of evil and that any association with them taints one forever. Dr. King
himself would not have accepted such a premise.&rdquo; Those of Mr. Parenti&rsquo;s
persuasion may see nothing scandalous in associations with known communists,
but the &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; whom he criticized knew better than to make that argument
in public.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of course, to say that King maintained
close affiliations with persons whom he knew to be communists is not to
say that King himself was ever a communist or that the movement he led
was controlled by communists; but his continuing associations with communists,
and his repeated dishonesty about those connections, do raise serious questions
about his own character, about the nature of his own political views and
goals, and about whether we as a nation should have awarded him (and should
continue to award him) the honor the holiday confers. Moreover, the embarrassing
political connections that were known at the time seem today to be merely
the tip of the ethical and political iceberg with which King&rsquo;s reputation
continues to collide.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While researching King&rsquo;s background
in 1983, I deliberately chose to dwell on his communist affiliations rather
than on other issues involving his sexual morality. I did so because at
that time the facts about King&rsquo;s subversive connections were well-documented,
while the details of his sex life were not. In the course of writing the
paper, however, I spoke to several former agents of the FBI who had been
personally engaged in the FBI surveillance of King and who knew from first-hand
observation that the rumors about his undisciplined sex life were substantially
true. A few years later, with the publication in 1989 of Ralph Abernathy&rsquo;s
autobiography, <i>And the Walls Came Tumbling Down</i>, those rumors were
substantiated by one of King&rsquo;s closest friends and political allies. It
is quite true that a person&rsquo;s sex life is largely his own business, but
in the case of an internationally prominent figure such as King, they become
publicly relevant, and they are especially relevant given the high moral
stature King&rsquo;s admirers habitually ascribe to him, the issue of his integrity
as a Christian clergyman, and the proposal to elevate him to the status
of a national moral icon.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the course of the Senate debate
on the King holiday, the East office received a letter from a retired FBI
official, Charles D. Brennan. Mr. Brennan, who had served as Assistant
Director of the FBI, stated that he had personally been involved in the
FBI surveillance of King and knew from first-hand observation the truth
about King&rsquo;s sexual conduct – conduct that Mr. Brennan characterized as&nbsp;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;orgiastic and adulterous
escapades, some of which indicated that King could be bestial in his sexual
abuse of women.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">He also stated that</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;King frequently drank to
excess and at times exhibited extreme emotional instability as when he
once threatened to jump from his hotel room window.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a study that he prepared, Mr. Brennan
described King&rsquo;s</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;sexual activities and his
excessive drinking&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">that FBI surveillance discovered. It
was this kind of conduct, he wrote, that led FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
to describe King as</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;a tom cat with obsessive
degenerate sexual urges&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">and President Lyndon Johnson to call
King a</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;hypocrite preacher.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Brennan also acknowledged:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;It was muck the FBI collected.
It was not the FBI&rsquo;s most shining hour. There would be no point in wallowing
in it again. The point is that the muck is there. It is there in the form
of transcripts, recordings, photos and logs. It is there in great quantity.
There are volumes of material labeled &lsquo;obscene.&rsquo; Future historians just
will not be able to avoid it.&rdquo;</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><p>It is precisely this material that is
sealed under court order until the year 2027 and to which the Senate was
denied access prior to the vote on the King holiday.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One instance from King&rsquo;s life that
perhaps illuminates his character was provided by historian David Garrow
in his study of the FBI&rsquo;s surveillance of King. Garrow recounts what the
FBI gathered during a 48-hour surveillance of King between February 22
and 24, 1964 in the Hyatt House Motel in Los Angeles.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;In that forty-eight hours
the Bureau acquired what in retrospect would be its most prized recordings
of Dr. King. The treasured highlight was a long and extremely funny storytelling
session during which King (a) bestowed supposedly honorific titles or appointments
of an explicitly sexual nature on some of his friends, (b) engaged in an
extended dialogue of double-entendre phrases that had sexual as well as
religious connotations, and (c) told an explicit joke about the rumored
sexual practices of recently assassinated President John F. Kennedy, with
reference to both Mrs. Kennedy, and the President&rsquo;s funeral.&rdquo;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Garrow&rsquo;s characterization of the episode
as &ldquo;extremely funny&rdquo; is one way of describing the incident; another is
that during the session in Los Angeles, King, a Christian minister, made
obscene jokes with his own followers (several of them also ministers),
made sexual and sacrilegious jokes, and made obscene and insulting remarks
intended to be funny about the late President Kennedy and his sex life
with Mrs. Kennedy. It should be recalled that these jokes were made by
King about a man who had supported his controversial cause, had lost political
support because of his support for King and the civil rights movement,
and had been dead for less than three months at the time King engaged in
obscene humor about him and his wife. In February, 1964, the nation was
still in a state of shock over Kennedy&rsquo;s death, but King apparently found
his death a suitable occasion for dirty jokes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">More recently still, in addition
to disclosures about King&rsquo;s bizarre sex life and his close connections
with communists, it has come to light that King&rsquo;s record of deliberate
deception in his own personal interests reaches as far back as his years
in college and graduate school, when he plagiarized significant portions
of his research papers and even his doctoral dissertation, an act that
would cause the immediate professional ruin of any academic figure. Evidence
of King&rsquo;s plagiarism, which was almost certainly known to his academic
sponsors at Boston University and was indisputably known to other academics
at the King Papers Project at Stanford University, was deliberately suppressed
and denied. It finally came to light in reports published by the <i>Wall
Street Journal</i> in 1990 and was later exhaustively documented in articles
and a monograph by Theodore Pappas of the Rockford Institute.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Yet, incredibly – even after thorough
documentation of King&rsquo;s affiliations with communists, after the revelations
about his personal moral flaws, and after proof of his brazen dishonesty
in plagiarizing his dissertation and several other published writings –
incredibly there is no proposal to rescind the holiday that honors him.
Indeed, states like Arizona and New Hampshire that did not rush to adopt
their own holidays in honor of King have themselves been vilified and threatened
with systematic boycotts. The continuing indulgence of King is in part
due to simple political cowardice – fear of being denounced as a &ldquo;racist&rdquo;
– but also to the political utility of the King holiday for those who seek
to advance their own political agenda. Almost immediately upon the enactment
of the holiday bill, the King holiday came to serve as a kind of charter
for the radical regime of &ldquo;political correctness&rdquo; and &ldquo;multiculturalism&rdquo;
that now prevails at many of the nation&rsquo;s major universities and in many
areas of public and private life.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is so because the argument generally
offered for the King holiday by King&rsquo;s own radical collaborators and disciples
is considerably different from the argument for it offered by most Republicans
and Democrats. The latter argue that they simply want to celebrate what
they take to be King&rsquo;s personal courage and commitment to racial tolerance;
the holiday, in their view, is simply celebratory and commemorative, and
they do not intend that the holiday should advance any other agenda. But
this is not the argument in favor of the King holiday that we hear from
partisans like Mrs. King and those who harbor similar views. A few days
after Senate passage of the holiday measure, Mrs. King wrote in the <i>Washington
Post</i> (October 23, 1983) about how the holiday should be observed.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;The holiday,&rdquo; she wrote,
&ldquo;must be substantive as well as symbolic. It must be more than a day of
celebration&hellip; . Let this holiday be a day of reflection, a day of teaching
nonviolent philosophy and strategy, a day of getting involved in nonviolent
action for social and economic progress.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">She noted that for years the Martin
Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;has conducted activities
around his birthday in many cities. The week-long observance has included
a series of educational programs, policy seminars or conferences, action-oriented
workshops, strategy sessions and planning meetings dealing with a wide
variety of current issues, from voter registration to full employment to
citizen action for nuclear disarmament.&rdquo;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A few months later, Robert Weisbrot,
a fellow of the DuBois Institute at Harvard, was writing in <i>The New
Republic</i> (January 30, 1984) that</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;in all, the nation&rsquo;s first
commemoration of King&rsquo;s life invites not only celebration, but also cerebration
over his – and the country&rsquo;s –&nbsp; unfinished tasks.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Those &ldquo;unfinished tasks,&rdquo; according
to Mr. Weisbrot, included</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;curbing disparities of
wealth and opportunity in a society still ridden by caste distinctions,&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">a task toward the accomplishment of
which</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;the reforms of the early
&lsquo;60s&rdquo; were &ldquo;only a first step.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Among those contemporary leaders &ldquo;seeking
to extend Martin Luther King&rsquo;s legacy,&rdquo; Mr. Weisbrot wrote,</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;by far the most influential
and best known is his former aide, Jesse Jackson.&rdquo;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The exploitation of the King
holiday for radical political purposes was even further enhanced by Vincent
Harding, &ldquo;Professor of Religion and Social Transformation at the Iliff
School of Theology in Denver,&rdquo; writing in the <i>New York Times</i> (January
18, 1988). Professor Harding rejected the notion that the King holiday
commemorates merely</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;a kind, gentle and easily managed
religious leader of a friendly crusade for racial integration.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such an understanding would</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;demean and trivialize Dr. King&rsquo;s
meaning.&rdquo;</font>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Professor Harding wrote:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;The Martin Luther King
of 1968 was calling for and leading civil disobedience campaigns against
the unjust war in Vietnam. Courageously describing our nation as &lsquo;the greatest
purveyor of violence in the world today,&rsquo; he was urging us away from a
dependence on military solutions. He was encouraging young men to refuse
to serve in the military, challenging them not to support America&rsquo;s anti-Communist
crusades, which were really destroying the hopes of poor nonwhite peoples
everywhere.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;This Martin Luther King was calling
for a radical redistribution of wealth and political power in American
society as a way to provide food, clothing, shelter, medical care, jobs,
education and hope for all of our country&rsquo;s people.&rdquo;</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><p>To those of King&rsquo;s own political views,
then, the true meaning of the holiday is that it serves to legitimize the
radical social and political agenda that King himself favored and to delegitimize
traditional American social and cultural institutions – not simply those
that supported racial segregation but also those that support a free market
economy, an anti-communist foreign policy, and a constitutional system
that restrains the power of the state rather than one that centralizes
and expands power for the reconstruction of society and the redistribution
of wealth. In this sense, the campaign to enact the legal public holiday
in honor of Martin Luther King was a small first step on the long march
to revolution, a charter by which that revolution is justified as the true
and ultimate meaning of the American identity. In this sense, and also
in King&rsquo;s own sense, as he defined it in his speech at the Lincoln Memorial
in 1963, the Declaration of Independence becomes a &ldquo;promissory note&rdquo; by
which the state is authorized to pursue social and economic egalitarianism
as its mission, and all institutions and values that fail to reflect the
dominance of equality – racial, cultural, national, economic, political,
and social – must be overcome and discarded.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman,Times">By placing King – and therefore his
own radical ideology of social transformation and reconstruction – into
the central pantheon of American history, the King holiday provides a green
light by which the revolutionary process of transformation and reconstruction
can charge full speed ahead. Moreover, by placing King at the center of
the American national pantheon, the holiday also serves to undermine any
argument against the revolutionary political agenda that it has come to
symbolize. Having promoted or accepted the symbol of the new dogma as a
defining – perhaps the defining – icon of the American political order,
those who oppose the revolutionary agenda the symbol represents have little
ground to resist that agenda.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is hardly an accident, then, that
in the years since the enactment of the holiday and the elevation of King
as a national icon, systematic attacks on the Confederacy and its symbolism
were initiated, movements to ban the teaching of &ldquo;Western civilization&rdquo;
came to fruition on major American universities, Thomas Jefferson was denounced
as a &ldquo;racist&rdquo; and &ldquo;slaveowner,&rdquo; and George Washington&rsquo;s name was removed
from a public school in New Orleans on the grounds that he too owned slaves.
In the new nation and the new creed of which the King holiday serves as
symbol, all institutions, values, heroes, and symbols that violate the
dogma of equality are dethroned and must be eradicated. Those associated
with the South and the Confederacy are merely the most obvious violations
of the egalitarian dogma and therefore must be the first to go, but they
will by no means be the last.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The political affiliations of Martin
Luther King that Sen. Jesse Helms so courageously exposed are thus only
pointers to the real danger that the King holiday represents. The logical
meaning of the holiday is the ultimate destruction of the American Republic
as it has been conceived and defined throughout our history, and until
the charter for revolution that it represents is repealed, we can expect
only further installations of the destruction and dispossession it promises.</font>
