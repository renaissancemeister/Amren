						<p>A second University of Cape Town professor has been murdered.</p>
<p>Professor Lisbé Smit (nee Smuts), 47, was found in the pool at her Wellington home on Monday.</p>
<p>This comes two days after the death of associate mathematics professor Brian Hahn, who was attacked at the university on January 28, allegedly by a former Ph D student.</p>
<p>A teenage suspect is in custody after Monday&rsquo;s attack.</p>
<p>Smuts was surprised by an intruder after she returned home from running errands and taking her children to school at about 7.30am.</p>
<p>There were signs of a brutal struggle in the house and it appeared that Smuts had been chased outside the house. </p>
<p>She was found floating in the pool.</p>
<p>Police on the scene said she was barely alive when discovered and died soon afterwards. </p>
<p>An initial examination at the scene showed several stab wounds in her head and neck.</p>
<p>Neighbour Alexa Kirsten, who came to her aid during the attack, was stabbed several times with a screwdriver.</p>
<p>Kirsten is in a serious condition at Paarl Medi-Clinic.</p>
<p>Police were alerted about the attack as it happened, after neighbours reported hearing her screams. </p>
<p>Police rushed to the scene and spotted a 16-year-old youth fleeing.</p>
<p>An all-points alert mobilised patrols in the vicinity as police chased the suspect, who darted through an old-age home before he was arrested by a policeman near Boland Rugby Stadium. </p>
<p>It is suspected that the youth had been on robbery spree, as people in nearby streets had earlier also reported attacks and gave a similar description of their attacker.</p>
<p>The 16-year-old youth, from Noordkamp near Mbekweni, was found with items believed to have been taken from Smuts&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>UCT spokesperson Andrea Weiss confirmed Smuts was a senior lecturer and head of Afrikaans &amp; Netherlandic Studies in the School of Languages and Literature.</p>
<p>The murder comes as staff at the University of Cape Town are still stunned by the death of Hahn, 58, in Vincent Pallotti Hospital on Saturday.</p>
<p>In the attack, Hahn suffered severe facial fractures, and the next day had a stroke that paralysed one side of his body.</p>
<p>Maleafisha Tladi, 35, a former Ph D student who previously held a temporary post in the department, was arrested and initially appeared in court on a charge of attempted murder. He is out on bail of R500.</p>
<p>He now faces a charge of murder.</p>
<p>Dave Richardson, an honorary research associate in the department, said on Sunday that he and Hahn had worked together for 25 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brian was more than my colleague. He was also a very great personal friend who had very good leadership skills,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Department head Christopher Gilmour said there would be a huge gap in the lives of all who knew Hahn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have known him for about 20 years and he was a much-loved friend and colleague. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an excellent scientist but I will miss him most for his kind and caring nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilmour said the department was in a state of shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always very concerned about all his colleagues and he went out of his way to let them know they could rely on his support,&rdquo; Gilmour said.</p>
<p>Police spokesperson Elliot Sinyangana said Tladi would now be charged with murder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The investigating officer will inform the prosecutor of the new developments and it is up to the prosecutor to decide if there will be a new bail hearing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Hahn leaves his wife, Cleone, his children Lyndall, André and David, and Christine, his only granddaughter.</p>
