<div align="left"><i>Daniel Attila, American Renaissance, Jan. 1997</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I was born in Hungary, from which
I escaped in 1982 at age 18. I settled in New York in 1984 with the intention
of becoming an artist, but after nearly a decade of struggle I realized
I might never make it. In 1993 I enrolled in the City University of New
York, while I supported myself for four years as a conductor on New York
City subway trains. There can be only a few jobs that so quickly introduce
an immigrant to the realities of multi-racialism. Beneath the streets of
New York I have seen and done things that very few whites will – I hope – ever
see or do.</font>
<p><img src="/news/2005/02/countesy.GIF" height="167" width="200" align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conductors
operate the doors of trains, make announcements, give information to the
passengers, and oversee the safety of people on trains and platforms. Most
of the time they stay in a small compart- ment, or cab, in the middle car
of the train. There are many cities that operate subways with only a driver,
but New York City is a challenging place, where putting only one person
on the train would expose the system to violence and chaos.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Attending college while working underground is not a dream come true, but con- ductors are well paid. The starting
salary is $30-40,000 a year, with a top salary of $40-50,000, which that
can be reached in three years. Conductors who become drivers can earn $50-70,000
a year, depending on overtime. The high salaries are a result of the monopoly
the Transit Authority (TA) enjoys over city transportation. The union is
a mostly-black workforce, which cannot be tampered with by any politician
who wants a career in New York. Even as far back as the 1930s, the all-powerful
TA got through the depression without laying off a single employee.</font></p>
<p><table align="RIGHT" cellpadding="6" cols="1" width="220">
<tr>
<td>
<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t white Americans
want a job that pays $40-60,000 a year and doesn&rsquo;t even require a high-school
education?&rdquo;&nbsp;</font></font></center>
</td>

</table>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">I went to a high school in China
Town to take the civil service exam for the job. Once inside, I noticed
that I was the only white person there. Except for an Asian-Indian woman
who sat in front of me, I saw only black people, even though there were
at least 40 of us taking the test. &ldquo;How come I&rsquo;m the only white person
here?&rdquo; I wondered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t white Americans want a job that pays $40-60,000
a year and doesn&rsquo;t even require a high-school education?&rdquo; Perhaps in answer,
one of the blacks in front of me turned around and gave me a bizarre, hate-filled
look – a look I would often encounter in the years ahead.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The test was easy – surprisingly so – and
I wondered if it was possible for anyone over the age of six not to pass
it. I clearly remember one of the questions; I find it impossible to forget:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you are a bus driver and find
that a kid jumped onto the back of the bus, traveling on the outside, what
are you going to do?</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">a) I will suddenly break,
then accelerate, repeating this process until
the kid falls off and learns a lesson.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">b) I will just ignore the kid
and keep on driving as if unaware
of the problem.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">c) I will stop the bus and
personally make sure that the kid gets
off.</font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As part of the test, we also had to
find various places in the city, such as the Empire State Building, the
Brooklyn Bridge, and the United Nations, with the help of a city map provided
to us. This is similar to having Parisians find the Eiffel tower with the
help of a map. Needless to say, the test went well and I congratulated
myself for having settled in a country where well-paying jobs are so easy
to get.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I began learning about the reality
of America&rsquo;s racial dilemma right at the beginning of my training program
at the Transit Authority. There was a huge black fellow in our class who
had the habit of physically bumping into me at every opportunity. I could
feel that he did this intentionally, trying to make it hurt more than an
accidental collision would, but not enough to make it look like an assault.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The class consisted of about 80 people,
with only a half dozen whites. Most of the training was given by an old
white veteran who kept telling us funny and scary stories about transit
workers on duty. We were told to watch out for assaults by passengers.
&ldquo;Every one of you will be spat at,&rdquo; he insisted repeatedly, &ldquo;I guarantee
it.&rdquo; After the class training, which lasted about four weeks, we spent
two weeks on trains, operating under the supervision of experienced conductors.
Right on the first day, a strong black man who stood on the platform, whose
right arm was bigger than both of my thighs put together, made a sudden
attempt to punch me in the face as I leaned out the window to observe the
platform. The conductor who supervised me assured me that such things are
very dangerous and happen every day.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also during the break-in period,
I saw a horrible incident in the East New York section of Brooklyn. A horde
of black teenagers descended upon a black boy who was sitting quietly by
himself. Within seconds, they beat him from head to toe, then quickly fled
before the doors closed. We tried to talk to the boy, who was in bad shape,
asking him if he wanted medical help or the police. When he said he didn&rsquo;t
want either, we asked about the attack. It turned out he was on his way
to the first day on a job. The gang beat him up because they didn&rsquo;t want
him to work.</font>
<p><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="12" cols="1" width="220">

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">I felt their threatening
presence instinctively, but the rules require that the conductor lean out
the window&hellip;.&nbsp;</font></font></center>

</table>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After the break-in period, I was
qualified as a conductor and began to operate without supervision. It didn&rsquo;t
take long for our instructor&rsquo;s prediction to come true. I was conducting
a D train in the Bronx when I noticed a large group of black men gathered
on the platform, just outside the conductor&rsquo;s window. I felt their threatening
presence instinctively, but the rules require that the conductor lean out
the window and look down the platform in both directions before he closes
the doors. I had no choice but to open my window and take the risk. As
soon as I opened it, one of the men spat right into my eyes. I was wearing
safety goggles but still got some of the saliva on my skin – regulations
require that goggles be worn primarily to protect against passenger assaults.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Throughout the four years I spent
as a conductor, blacks and Latinos would hide behind posts or other cover
and spit at me – with astonishing power and accuracy. Other times they would
throw things at me, try to punch me, or yell vile and sometimes inarticulate
things at me.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One attack involved a black man of
about thirty, who threw a large, glass bottle at my face. I managed to
close the window just as the bottle struck – it hit with such force, that
pieces of glass stuck in the acrylic window of my cab all the way to the
end of the trip. As we came into the terminal, I spotted a black supervisor
on the platform and couldn&rsquo;t help asking: &ldquo;What am I supposed to do when
someone attacks me as I operate, and the attack is really nasty?&rdquo; &ldquo;If you
have an injury, you pull the cord and call command to send for the police
and the ambulance,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But what if you have no injuries? What
if he almost killed you but you lucked out?&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;Then there is
no problem,&rdquo; said the supervisor, &ldquo;you keep on going.&rdquo;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On another occasion, when conducting
a &ldquo;D&rdquo; train in the Bronx, a boy in a crowd of high-school students threw
a heavy stone right at my face with great accuracy and force. I instinctively
held up my hand to shield my face and was injured severely enough to go
to the emergency room. At the hospital, the nurse told me that a bus driver,
also injured in an assault, had just been treated and released a couple
of hours earlier.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When operating during the &ldquo;school
hours,&rdquo; the early afternoon when students come home from public schools,
rowdy students – none of whom was ever white or Oriental – would routinely
disable the trains. They would break windows, pull the emergency break,
and tear open the seats so they could cut out electric switches. If the
train crew couldn&rsquo;t fix the problem, we would discharge the passengers
and transfer the train to the storage yard for repair. When we discharged
trains, black and Latino passengers would threaten violence, accusing us
of deliberately disabling trains so that we could &ldquo;go home early.&rdquo;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My ordeal did not end with the work-day.
The commute home was just as agonizing as time on the job. In the late
hours, when I usually made my way home, the trains were largely bereft
of normal, working people. Often there were gangs of &ldquo;youths&rdquo; roaming the
trains, walking from car to car, jumping on seats, starting fights, and
harassing passengers. I often locked myself in the conductor&rsquo;s cab, as
I did on the job.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One night, after work, as I was climbing
the steps from the subway platform in my own neighborhood, a tall black
man came running the other way and crashed into me. He was so badly dressed
he looked like a bum. He was carrying a box of Chinese take-out food, which
he dropped when he slammed into me. There went his dinner. Although the
collision was entirely his fault, he began threatening me, cursing me,
and demanding money. I looked around to see if there was anybody else in
the station – not that one can expect help from whites in situations like
this – but there was no one.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I don&rsquo;t know how long we argued,
but it seemed like an eternity. Keeping him from attacking me took all
the energy I had. I finally managed to break away and run home. Exhausted,
I collapsed on the floor and began crying, in a way I don&rsquo;t remember doing
since I was a small child. What broke me down was not so much this particular
incident but the sum of all the assaults and humiliation that took place
before it – the attacks, the spitting, the name calling, and, ultimately,
my complete inability to do anything about it. Violent self-defense would
certainly cost any white transit worker his job.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">New Horizons</font></font>
<p><img src="/news/2005/02/strap.gif" height="551" width="150" align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My
job offered me the opportunity to see parts of New York whites seldom see.
The United States may be the only country that has never been attacked,
but still has places that look as though they went through a war. This
once-glamorous cultural capital has neighborhoods, the size of cities,
that look like Stalingrad or Yokohama right after a carpet bombing.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The job also acquainted me with blacks
I would never otherwise have known. My black colleagues never seemed upset
by the behavior of our &ldquo;customers,&rdquo; nor did they try to avoid working in
horrible neighborhoods. One reason was that although they were not entirely
safe, they did not face attacks of the same severity or frequency, let
alone attacks with racial overtones.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In their off hours, the blacks often
held little parties in our filthy, stuffy, underground crew rooms, where
they celebrated birthdays or Kwanzaa with cheap cake and fast food. Non-blacks
were ordered to leave the room before such events; most blacks believed
that segregation on equal terms was better than integration.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The blacks also talked about what
a scandal it was that the schools do not teach that Jesus Christ and the
ancient Egyptians were black. Every day, during lunch breaks, I witnessed
heated debates about such topics. I also learned that anything wrong in
black neighborhoods is the fault of whites. My colleagues believed that
slavery caused illegitimacy and welfare dependency, and that the government
simply refuses to spend money on neighborhoods where they live. &ldquo;When are
they going to take the money and clean up the Bronx, Brooklyn, and upper
Manhattan?&rdquo; they would ask.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whites never engaged in open debate
about such things, preferring to scribble their opinions on the walls of
the bathrooms provided for transit workers. &ldquo;Kill all Niggers,&rdquo; was the
harshest sentiment I ever saw, along with such admonitions as &ldquo;Do your
country a favor, kill a liberal!&rdquo; Working underground seemed to degrade
everyone.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In addition to the pressures of the
job, I was forced to put up with the anti-white atmosphere of City College.
One of the most anti-white teachers was an otherwise intelligent English
professor named Hannah Rogers. After a few classes filled with insults
to whites, Prof. Rogers made a little speech that went something like this:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&ldquo;In the beginning, before
the white man came along, the colored peoples who once owned this land
lived here peacefully, cohabiting with each other, with nature, and with
the animals. Then came the Europeans, who killed the people and the animals,
and destroyed nature. Now, however, the people of color are beginning to
reclaim the land that belongs to them, and there will come a day when the
colored masses rise up, and the white people who managed to enslave every
other race will be destroyed. The land will be taken back so that the people
to whom it belongs can return to living in peace and harmony with each
other, and nature. I only hope,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;that when that day comes,
the whites who were good will be spared.&rdquo;</font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I was offended and shocked, but I learned
something I had never suspected. I always thought &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; are the way
they are because they live in white ghettos and don&rsquo;t realize what is happening
around them. Not so. At least some of them believe a civil war is on the
horizon. They hope for it, they encourage it, and may even expect to gain
from it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">East New York</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perhaps the most dreadful incident
of my career at the TA was in the summer of 1993, while I was working on
the A line. This is one of the lines that goes into the worst neighborhood
of the city, the East New York section of Brooklyn. I never operated there
for a single day without being assaulted or humiliated in some way.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On one hot afternoon, as I opened
the doors at the Ralph Avenue station, I heard what sounded like gunshots.
They were a lot quieter than in movies, and at first I thought it was just
some noise coming from the equipment. However, I was unnerved to see a
couple of blacks, wearing face masks, rush out of the last car, up the
steps, and disappear.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There was no way to misunderstand
the situation; an incident had taken place in the last car, and the rules
required the conductor to investigate. No experienced conductor would ever
go back to the last car in a situation like that, no matter what the rules
say, but I was not very experienced. After making some announcements to
the passengers, I gathered all my courage and walked back to the last car,
pretending to be calm.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There were people standing in every
door shouting about the delay. In the last car, I found a man lying on
the floor with bloody wounds in his legs. I used my portable radio to tell
the train operator what had happened, and began to walk back to the center
of the train to my position. The train operator made a loud announcement
requesting that all passengers leave the train, and I was to make sure
that all the cars were empty before we closed the doors to wait for the
police.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I was the only white person in the
station. As the passengers got off, they stayed on the platform and began
to form a row close to the train. I walked toward my position, fenced in
by the train on the left and by the row of people on the right. I passed
three cars and had two more to go, to reach the only position from which
I could close the doors. I was supposed to walk all the way to the front,
passing all ten cars, to make sure that no passengers remained in them.
I sensed that I could not make it to the front of the train, and tried
only to get back to my position.</font>
<p><table align="RIGHT" cellpadding="12" cols="1" width="200">
<tr>
<td>
<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">There was a real chance
that I could be – well – lynched before the police arrived.</font></font></center>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As I advanced, the people seemed
to move closer to the train, gradually narrowing the path until it became
too narrow for me to pass without touching them. &ldquo;Who got shot, black or
white?&rdquo; I heard a young man shout. Then I saw hands reaching out to grab
me and fists aimed to punch me. Just as I was about to pass the third car,
one of the punches hit my shoulder. At this point I realized there was
a real chance that I could be – well – lynched before the police arrived.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My heart pounding, I jumped into
the car and began running inside the train, trying to reach my position.
I no longer cared about any passengers remaining in the cars; I just ran.
There were two more cars to cross, each separated by a pair of heavy, steel
doors that open slowly. I wrenched them open with all my might. Meanwhile,
the crowd seemed about to follow me into the train. I finally reached my
position and, without any announcements or sticking my head out to observe
the platform, shoved my key in and hit the door close buttons. The lights
indicated that half the doors had not closed, meaning that people were
holding them. When this happens, normally the conductor opens them again
to let people in or out, but I refused to open up. After several tense
minutes, people stopped holding the doors and they finally closed.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I hid in my cab for perhaps as long
as half an hour until the police finally arrived. &ldquo;What kind of people
did you see running in masks?&rdquo; asked a black bureaucrat dressed in a business
suit. I refused to answer, for fear that mentioning blacks could get me
in trouble. He seemed to be familiar with this attitude on the part of
whites, because he calmly and understandingly said, &ldquo;They were black, right?&rdquo;
He nodded his head in answer to his own question, and made a note on a
piece of paper.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Later, as we were slowly moving into
the service yard, accompanied by a police escort, I reflected on the incident.
I recalled how many times I have heard liberals claiming that 99 percent
of the blacks who live in these neighborhoods are &ldquo;hard working and law
abiding,&rdquo; with only a tiny one percent who cause trouble. Perhaps I&rsquo;m prejudiced,
but among the hundreds of people on that platform who looked as though
they were ready to lynch me, I didn&rsquo;t see many who looked hard working
or law abiding.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During the same summer, there was
another incident, while passing Kennedy Airport. I heard something that
sounded like an explosion. I investigated but didn&rsquo;t find anything that
could have caused it, though the sound seemed to come from nearby. Then,
as we pulled into the next station, I was notified over the radio that
my train operator, a black woman, had had her windshield broken out by
a stone block, the size of a child&rsquo;s head, thrown from somewhere on the
airport&rsquo;s property. I then realized, that what I had heard was the sound
of another stone smashing between the two cars, just missing my cab window.
One of these rocks is heavy enough to kill a person easily. The train operator
was lucky to be alive.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is hard to believe, but I worked
for two more years in the subway before I finally turned my back on that
hellish job, in the summer of 1995. I now live in a privately policed community
in Manhattan. I ride the subways only if an emergency requires it.</p></font>

  It&rsquo;s dificult to think of anything more to say than that, anything I said would be far less eloquent than what Daniel Attila wrote.<br><br>
  Let me just say that the Asians really don&rsquo;t like us that much either, but they tend to be physically smaller than us, so they don&rsquo;t often act out violently.  (Except for the occasional Hmong hunter).</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I read this article years ago, from the archives, when I originally began to explore <span class="caps">AR, </span>and subscribe. It is one of the most compelling testimonies and articles on <span class="caps">AR.</span> It profoundly added to my own racial experience, which, bad as it was, had yet to explore the kind of hell hole darkness that exists in literally underground <span class="caps">N.Y.</span> City.</p>
<p>It powerfully confirmed my strongest suspicions. It added to a lifetime of hard personal experince and to the experiences I have gleaned from my fellow whites with whom I personally interact (family, friends, etc.).</p>
<p>The articles&rsquo; power is in the genuineness and believe-ability of its&rsquo; testimony. It would hold up in court (at least if the jury wasn&rsquo;t all black).</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I can see how people who do not agree with <span class="caps">AR&rsquo;</span>s message would subscribe to AR just to be able to read this kind of story. Where else can a person read of such things? I believe that AR is saving lives with articles such as this one. I now know what lurks in the subways of New York. This article is one of the reasons I became a reader of <span class="caps">AR.</span> I bet the <span class="caps">ADL </span>was captivated by this article when they first read it (we all know they read AR) and they probably admited, bitterly, that AR is more than a &#8220;psuedo scientific&#8221; journal. It&rsquo;s real life. It&rsquo;s gritty.<br>
The man that wrote it is brave, and I think AR has done us a service by telling us about anti white racism.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe, but there are no White bus drivers in Chicago - they&rsquo;re all Black.  For those Whites who strive for &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;equity&#8221;, this is what you are striving for - it&rsquo;s a type of diversity and equity constructed by and for people who aren&rsquo;t bright enough to grasp the meaning of the words, so instead they create simplistic perversions of them.<br>

  <font size="3"><p><i>I recalled how many times I have heard liberals claiming that 99 percent of the blacks who live in these neighborhoods are &ldquo;hard working and law abiding,&rdquo; with only a tiny one percent who cause trouble. Perhaps I&rsquo;m prejudiced, but among the hundreds of people on that platform who looked as though they were ready to lynch me, I didn&rsquo;t see many who looked hard working or law abiding.</i></p>
<p>When Blacks see White hatred, bigotry, and racism - they are looking at the pale rendering of their own reflections in a mirror.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>This article makes me angry. The black people described in this article are the majority, not the minority. Sure there are a few good, educated blacks that do rise above such ghetto and barbaric behaviors, but they are few and far between.</p>
<p>It is true, such evil behaviors are mostly exhibited blacks and hispanics. Whites and asians are not the [main] ones tearing down neighborhoods, taking up social services time and money, living in flith and going out of their way to terrorize society. I am sick of it. Black people are rude. I realized 90% of the time a black salesperson helps you they are rude. I wish blacks (and hispanics) would one day- by some miracle of God- get their acts together. For staters, stop being so damn rude. Start raising some decent children instead of these hell-raising thugs who rape, murder, and steal why you stand behind proclaiming their innocence (I know and must acknowledge, Scott Peterson&rsquo;s parents did the same grotesque thing).</p>
<p>&#8220;I also learned that anything wrong in black neighborhoods is the fault of whites.&#8221; How true this statement is, reflecting the very ignorance which blacks keep themselves down. I just wish they would keep themselves down elsewhere.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>Great comment Jim.  There&rsquo;s nothing more insulting and quite honestly, heart breaking, to me than to hear a white female run her own people into the ground verbally.  I don&rsquo;t know whether to hit them or just walk away.<br>

  <font size="3"><p>This article really hits home. I started my Wall Street career right after college in the mid-1990s. Every day I took the subway from Grand Central Terminal to Lower Manhattan, and back. My experiences on the <span class="caps">NYC </span>subway were a real eye-opener and the beginnings of my racial awakenings.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>J,</p>
<p>For every Scott Peterson, White Foster parents who abuse their children or White School teacher who has sex with their students there is 50 minorities who are doing the same.</p>
<p>Our media masters would never let these stories trickle through to the white sheeple.  The Color of Crime percentages applies across the board in other areas of disgusting behaviour</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Matt,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the info and website. I admit that you are 100% right. The Peterson case hit very close to home and I just had to throw that in for aggression sake.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the website.</p></font><p>Posted
