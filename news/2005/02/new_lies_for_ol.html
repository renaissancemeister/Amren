<p><i>Samuel Francis, American Renaissance, June 1997</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>Whenever you get into a debate, you can almost always tell your opponent
is hiding something when he starts piling up new arguments for his position
in place of the old arguments you've already refuted. In the debate over
IQ and race, this happens frequently.&nbsp;
<p>First the argument was that IQ tests were culturally biased. But new
IQ tests showed that the more you control for cultural bias, the larger
the IQ differences between the races. Then it was claimed that intelligence
really can't be tested. But performance on IQ tests matched performance
in school, academic tests, and professional success. Then they said &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;
doesn't really exist anyway. But intelligence is a concept that human societies
have always recognized and would find it hard to abandon. Finally, the
most recent argument has been that &ldquo;race&rdquo; doesn't really exist, that it's
only a &ldquo;social construct.&rdquo; Now even that defense of egalitarianism, an
increasingly common one, is starting to shrivel.
<p>But the shriveling isn't happening without a good deal of last-ditch
egalitarian resistance. On April 17th, T<i>he Washington Post</i> reported
in a front page story that archaeologists have now found remains of quite
a few prehistoric pilgrims to North America whose skeletons are – well
– &ldquo;Caucasoid&rdquo; (see AR, January and April, for reports on &ldquo;Kennewick Man&rdquo;).
This is a problem for two reasons.
<p>In the first place, as everyone who has seen the Eisner version of &ldquo;Pocahontas&rdquo;
knows, Caucasians were invaders who stole the country from the &ldquo;First Americans&rdquo;–
namely the North American Indians, who, as <i>Post</i> staff writer Boyce
Rensberger put it, &ldquo;all resembled today's Asiatic peoples, popularly called
Mongoloids.&rdquo; (Popularly? When was the last time you heard someone in a
bar referring to Asians or Orientals as Mongoloids?)&nbsp; If the &ldquo;First
Americans&rdquo; or &ldquo;Native Americans&rdquo; were really Caucasian, then maybe Mr.
Eisner will have to remake his movie and a lot of textbooks will have to
be rewritten. But more of that problem anon.
<p>First, how could scientists tell the skeletons were Caucasian rather
than Mongoloid?&nbsp; Identification, says the <i>Post</i> story, was &ldquo;based
on a scientific technique called craniofacial morphometric analysis. It
involves detailed study of the shape of the skull and face, using a sophisticated
method called multivariate analysis. In some cases, more than 60 different
dimensions of a skull are measured and compared with comparable dimensions
considered typical of specific racial groups.&rdquo;
<p>But if race doesn't really exist, if it's just a &ldquo;social construct,&rdquo;
how can you identify the race of a skeleton? Mr. Rensberger (or his editors
at Egalitarian HQ) tried to handle the difficulty manfully and sensitively.
Here is their solution:
<blockquote>&ldquo;Most anthropologists agree that races, as most people use
the term, are socially defined groupings with no scientific definition.
No physical traits are exclusively the property of one race or another.
Still, anthropologists agree that certain combinations of measurements,
chiefly of the face and skull, can be used to determine whether individuals
belong to one population [!] or another. This is true primarily for groups
[!!] that have been separated geographically for thousands of years.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Now in the first place, the above paragraph has nothing to do with
the news content of the story. It is inserted purely for ideological instruction,
to let readers know that the <i>Post</i> has not signed up with the <i>Bell
Curve</i> boys who believe that race might really exist after all. Back
in the good old days of the Soviet Union, <i>Pravda</i> probably had lots
of paragraphs just like it. But in the second place, whether Mr. Rensberger
or his editors realize it or not, they have just told their readers that
race really does exist. It exists, not as a social construct or as &ldquo;socially
defined,&rdquo; but as an objective fact of nature.
<p><table align="left" width="220"><tr><td><img src="/news/2005/02/skull.gif" height="173" width="200"></td></tr> <tr><td><div class="text-center">
<b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Favorite football team:
unknown.</font></b></div></table>Class, for example, is a &ldquo;social construct.&rdquo; You cannot tell someone's
class by examining his skeleton. Nor can you tell his religion, nationality,
regional origin, marital status, or favorite football team. But you can
identify his race (and sex) because race is not &ldquo;socially defined&rdquo; but,
like sex, is defined by nature.
<p>As J. Philippe Rushton notes in his Race, Evolution, and Behavior,
&ldquo;The view that race is only a social construct is contradicted
by biological evidence. Along with blood protein and DNA data . . . forensic
scientists are able to classify skulls by race.&rdquo; (p. 235)
As behavioral geneticist Glayde Whitney wrote in AR (March, 1997),
&ldquo;it has already become obvious that there are substantial genetic
differences between the races. It is trivial to identify unerringly the
race of any individual, including mixes of various races. This fact should
forever dispel the myth of racial equivalence. Fashionable nonsense to
the effect that race is a social rather than a biological phenomenon is
clearly and demonstrably false.&rdquo;
Race, in other words, is a genetic construct, a natural construct, and
social definitions have nothing to do with it.
<p>The discovery of the Caucasoid skeletons in North America lets a lot
of skeletons out of the scientific and journalistic closets, and some &ldquo;scientists&rdquo;
whose job it is to guard those closets don't much like it. As the <i>Post</i>
was careful to point out later in the same story, &ldquo;Some anthropologists
reject the Caucasoid label for the prehistoric skeletons.&rdquo;
<p>Daniel Grayson of the University of Washington, for one, says that using
the word &ldquo;Caucasoid&rdquo; &ldquo;raises &lsquo;a red flag, suggesting that whites were here
earlier and Indians were here later.&rsquo; &ldquo;Professor Grayson adds that using
&ldquo;the word,&rdquo; as the <i>Post</i> refers to the term Caucasoid, &ldquo;implies that
the ancient peoples who reached the New World were like today's Europeans
or American whites.&rdquo;
<p>Well, this is obviously getting out of hand, and it brings us to the
second problem raised by these ancient skeletons. Somebody might say that
the Europeans who arrived after 1492 weren't such aggressive invaders after
all, that they might even have had some right to come here since their
ancestors were here at least as early as &ldquo;First Americans.&rdquo;
<p>Hence, the <i>Post</i> is quick to point out that &ldquo;some other anthropologists&rdquo;
(who remain unnamed) note,&nbsp;
&ldquo;the &lsquo;apparently Caucasoid&rsquo; skeletons may represent a physical
type that was not ancestral to today's Europeans. . . . In other words,
the scientists say it is possible that it is only a coincidence that the
ancient skeletons have features that resemble those of Europeans.&rdquo;
Well, that's much better, because, you see, even though race doesn't really
exist and is only a social construct, the prehistoric Caucasoids who came
here were not of the same race as the later Caucasoid invaders.
<p>Obviously, the white people who came to this continent 9,000 years ago
didn't establish any political or cultural claim to the continent for modern
whites, regardless of whether they were &ldquo;ancestral&rdquo; to them. Neither does
the presence of Mongoloid ancestors of the modern Indians establish any
political or cultural claim for their modern descendants. The claims of
each group are based on what their more immediate ancestors contributed
to the making of what is today American civilization and the American nation,
and it ought to be fairly obvious that the modern European races (excuse
me, I meant &ldquo;population groups&rdquo;) had a bit more to do with that than the
Kwakiutls and the Ojibwas.
<p>But another obvious point is that modern racial egalitarians can't bear
to look at the evidence from comparative anatomy and molecular genetics
that now prances before their eyes, and they have to resort to the most
grotesque ideological and linguistic contortions to preserve the egalitarian
myth that race doesn't exist. Newspapers like the <i>Post</i> and some
scientists like (apparently) Professor Grayson are always happy to enlist
themselves in the preservation of such myths, to the point that both science
and journalism are imperiled. If the trend continues we might as well give
the country back to the Caucasoids.</font>

  <font size="3"><p>Great stuff. Egalitarianism is in such opposition with reason that it is shocking that the masses ingest such nonsense. Dr. Francis had a great talent for exposing such absurdity.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I hesitate to dispute Dr Francis when he can no longer defend his views, but I believe he would wish us to continue civilized discussion. In particular, the following statements</p>
<p>&#8220;Class, for example, is a &ldquo;social construct.&rdquo; You cannot tell someone&rsquo;s class by examining his skeleton.&#8221;</p>
<p>are probably correct for North America, but they have often been false in Britain. Here, the differences in nutrition between economic strata, and, particularly, lower protein consumption, led to several obvious distinctions between the classes, such as lower average height amongst poorer groups. These differences have been disappearing since World War <span class="caps">II, </span>and are now statistically insignificant, but they were quite obvious before that. Australian soldiers during World War I commented on the shortness of British troops, but this was, of course, merely due to better nutrition in Australia, since almost all Australians were recently transplanted Brits in 1914  &mdash;  1918.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>  Absolutely beautiful writing.  The provably false opinion that Asiatic Amerinds were in the Americas first is defended with such vehemence because the political ideology wherein European whites do not have the &#8220;right&#8221; to live in the Americas is threatened by discoveries like the late Kennewick Man.  Just as mixing dirty water with clean water gets you dirty water, mixing politics with science gets you politics.  Just as the Catholic church once felt threatened by the notion that the Earth orbits the sun, the priests of political correctness dogma are threatened by Kennewick man.  Make no mistake; political correctness is a religion, and like any other religion, the basic assumptions in it are not subject to discussion or debate.<br>
