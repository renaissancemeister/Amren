<p><font size="3"><p>WASHINGTON &mdash; Fleeing Iran after he was tortured for converting to Christianity, a man and his family recently showed up on the US doorstep, seeking asylum. But now, many religious conservatives say, the family&rsquo;s door to freedom will be shut if some Republicans in Congress succeed in giving Homeland Security officials nearly unfettered discretion to keep refugees out.</p>
<p>Persecuted Christians such as the Iranian family &mdash; which has an ongoing case in Massachusetts, one of hundreds around the country &mdash; have become powerful symbols in a dispute dividing two political pillars of the Bush administration. A bill to tighten asylum rules that is being aggressively pushed by House Judiciary Committee chairman F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, is driving a wedge between conservative factions.</p>
<p>Evangelical Christians opposed to the bill say those fleeing religious oppression present a textbook example of why the United States must preserve a compassionate asylum system &mdash; and they point to President Bush&rsquo;s soaring words about freedom to buttress their case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But evangelical groups, many of which help refugees flee religious persecution, see the bill as draconian. Lining up with liberal organizations such as Human Rights First and Amnesty International, the Christians say they cannot understand why Bush has endorsed Sensenbrenner&rsquo;s bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t fit in with the President Bush I&rsquo;m familiar with through what he has said about Sudan and the persecuted people there &hellip; or about human rights in North Korea,&rdquo; said Faith McDonnell, director of religious liberty for the evangelical Institute on Religion and Democracy. The bill &ldquo;ends up punishing people who are just seeking to save their lives because of their integrity and commitment to faith.&rdquo;</p>

  <font size="3"><p>I want to comment that Christianity itself is not the problem   &mdash;   the problem is the mediocre calibre of the people who are trying to disseminate its tenets.  We have in the <span class="caps">USA, </span>many tens of millions in the evangelical Christian community   &mdash;   a huge, formidable, and politically - well - muscled group who would probably eclipse the <span class="caps">AARP </span>lobby if they so chose to organize themselves politically.  Unfortuneately, they are people comprised mostly of the left side of the Bell Curve and incapable of critical deduction and reasoning from independent information sources   &mdash;   instead, they are more apt to swallow emotionally palatable messages from their church pulpit and television / mass media at face value without question. Their leaders are cartoon caricatures ( remember the histrionic sociopath Jimmy Swaggert and his naive bumpkin followers ? what about Pat Robertson   &mdash;   I always imagine that guy as a perv working behind the counter at 31 flavors ) who landed their jobs because they weren&rsquo;t competent enough for other careers.  I remember seeing an episode of &#8221; funniest animal videos &#8221; on TV couple of years ago, where a zookeeper amused himself in a penguin enclosure by shining a flashlight on the surface of a wall.  The penguins furiously and uncontrollably whirled and spun their necks trying to follow that spot of light&hellip; totally unaware of, and unable to deduce a causal relationship between this strange spot of light and the ( giggling )higher - intellect animal manipulating it hidden from their view.  </p>
<p>To me, these evangelical Christians are the penguins, clinging to the reassuring nostrums of their various comic - book mythological visions of Armaggedon, the Rapture, etc.  They comprise the other leg of support for the corrosion of European - American interests( albeit the idiot fraction ), together with white Liberal nihilists ( who are often smart, educated, but also atheistic, cunning, self - hating, &amp; traitorous )  &mdash;  - and always ready to sell their own people out. In fact, I can guarantee you, they will be the first ones to turn in WNs for kangaroo trials in any possible future social cataclysm ( economic collapse, etc).   So lets go easy on the rhetoric when it comes to compiling the shortcomings of the &#8221; minorities, illegal immigrants, etc &#8221;   &mdash;   because that is essentially a moot point.  The people who make these things possible in this country, with the real influence and power who are reaming the American middle and working classes are the Liberal ( and &#8221; conservative &#8221; ) white financial, corporate, educational, and cultural elites. I think deep down everyone knows that, and that&rsquo;s why it is so difficlt and painful to acknowledge   &mdash;   no one wants to admit that it is a member of your own family who is screwing you and plotting your demise. Its easier to kick your dog than admit suspicions that your own wife is cheating on you.</p>
<p>As noted by other posters, Christianity comes in for a shellacking because it seems to be supportive of white disposession.  But the problem is not Christianity per se.   Its the dearth of smart leaders who understand the era - specific message of the New Testament, and its indirect relationship to ethnic / cultural identity.   The message of Jesus is simple, accessible, and universalist in one sense, but in another aspect ( which few people understand ) there is embedded in the fine print a complex, highly chauvanistic, elitist code difficult to decipher by the casual reader. The dilemma of Christianity, in my view, is that it is perhaps 3000 years ahead of its time   &mdash;   essentially, it was designed for a &#8221; Star - Trek &#8221; or &#8221; Star Wars &#8221; type of world in which intelligent people are already firmly grounded in the notion of universal morality and human dignity.  It was not designed for feeble - minded people ( priests, ministers, pastors ) whose distorted misinterpretations of the Bible propel them to commit acts injurious to the propagation and health of their own religion. </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Evangelical Protestantism is incompatable with white racial survival.  I was raised in an non-fundamentalist evangelical church, by the way.  These people are some of our biggest enemies, despite the fact that they are &#8220;conservative.&#8221;  Raising the white American IQ average to that of Askenazi Jews would reduce fundamentalism to an insignificant force.  Another reason to support eugenics.  </p></font><p>Posted
