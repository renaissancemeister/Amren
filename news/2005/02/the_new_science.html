            <p>In the recent film thriller <i>Red Dragon</i>, actor 
              Ralph Fiennes plays a serial killer whose psychopathic urge to commit 
              murder is the product of his upbringing by an abusive grandmother. 
              Unfortunately for the producers, the film and the book on which 
              it is based were written and produced before the appearance of Steven 
              Pinker&rsquo;s <i>The Blank Slate</i>, one of the targets of which 
              is the notion that social environment causes criminal behavior. 
              The broader target Prof. Pinker&rsquo;s book seeks to demolish is 
              the closely related idea that human beings have no inherent nature 
              but are merely empty vessels into which the &#147;culture,&#148; 
              the &#147;social environment,&#148; the &#147;class structure,&#148; 
              &#147;history,&#148; or some other abstraction may pour whatever 
              fluids it wills. Prof. Pinker, a world-renowned linguist at M.I.T. 
              and the author of several earlier books arguing similar positions, 
              is well-suited to this work of demolition, and on the whole he succeeds.</p>
            <p>Obviously, the &#147;blank slate&#148; is merely 
              one more metaphor for the &#147;empty vessel,&#148; but whatever 
              the metaphor, it is an idea that denies the meaning and importance, 
              if not the very existence, of race, and the denial of race has been 
              one of the principal uses to which the blank slate doctrine has 
              been applied in the last century. The phrase itself comes from the 
              17th century English philosopher John Locke, whose treatise on psychology 
              described human nature as a &#147;<i>tabula rasa</i>,&#148; an &#147;empty 
              tablet,&#148; that merely receives sense impressions and is the 
              product of those impressions. Locke was also a major architect of 
              modern liberalism, and the blank slate theory in one form or another 
              underlies much of modern liberal thought. In the 20th century the 
              same idea was embraced not only by Marxists, whose application of 
              it to human beings produced much of the chaos and tyranny associated 
              with modern communism, but also by Western liberals&mdash;John Dewey, 
              John B. Watson and the &#147;behaviorist&#148; school of psychology 
              that he founded&mdash;and, perhaps most notably, by Franz Boas and 
              the school of anthropology he and his disciples imposed throughout 
              American universities until recently.</p>

            <p>It was in the Boasian school of anthropology that 
              the blank slate denial of human nature was most influential, and 
              it reached what was perhaps its <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> (in 
              American academic quarters, at any rate) in the concoctions of Boas&rsquo;s 
              student, Margaret Mead, about the sex lives of Samoans. Despite 
              their transparent absurdity, both the blank slate theory and its 
              bizarre applications in scholarship and thought have been taken 
              seriously by psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists, historians, 
              and most other academics, as well as journalists, creative writers, 
              and even by Hollywood, whence they have come to infect the minds 
              of otherwise sensible people who are not professional intellectuals. 
              Politically, much of what the Progressive Era, the New Deal, and 
              the Great Society did or tried to do was justified in terms of blank 
              slate doctrine. In the Soviet Union, not only the forced redistribution 
              of property and the attempt to abolish class and other forms of 
              social hierarchy but also the disastrous dogmas of &#147;Lysenkoism&#148; 
              were applications of blank slate theory.</p>
            <p>Prof. Pinker argues that the blank slate concept 
              is closely related to two other ideas with which he takes issue: 
              the idea of the &#147;Noble Savage&#148; (essentially, that human 
              beings are naturally good or peaceful, non-dominating, non-aggressive, 
              and non-acquisitive) and the idea of the &#147;Ghost in the Machine&#148; 
              (essentially, that a non-material mind exists distinct from the 
              material body), a concept he firmly rejects. Margaret Mead&rsquo;s 
              depiction of cute and harmless little Samoans copulating with no 
              guilt, fear, or jealousy is one of the better-known examples of 
              the former concept, which she managed to combine with the blank 
              slate doctrine she picked up from her mentor Boas. </p>
            <p>Prof. Pinker slaughters the noble savage mythology 
              with little trouble. &#147;As the anthropologist Derek Freeman later 
              [after Mead] documented,&#148; he writes, &#147;Samoans may beat 
              or kill their daughters if they are not virgins on their wedding 
              night, a young man who cannot woo a virgin may rape one to extort 
              her into eloping, and the family of a cuckolded husband may attack 
              and kill the adulterer.&#148; As for &#147;peaceful&#148; or &#147;gentle&#148; 
              primitives, anthropologists have found that &#147;the !Kung San 
              [of the Kalahari Desert] have a murder rate higher than that of 
              American inner cities,&#148; while the &#147;gentle Tasaday,&#148; 
              a tribe discovered in the Philippine rain forest that supposedly 
              lived &#147;with no words for conflict, violence, or weapons,&#148; 
              turned out to be an outright fraud concocted by the crooked government 
              of Ferdinand Marcos. </p>
            <p>The death rates from primitive warfare may sound 
              low compared to those of modern wars, but many of the intellectuals 
              impressed by them &#147;do not notice that two deaths in a band 
              of fifty people is the equivalent of ten million deaths in a country 
              the size of the United States.&#148; Prof. Pinker cites data that 
              show that the proportion of male deaths caused by war in primitive 
              cultures dwarfs that of the United States and Europe even in the 
              bloodiest of all centuries, the 20th. It is civilized man who reduces 
              the number of war deaths, not primitives.</p>
            <p>Prof. Pinker is firm and clear about the &#147;inherent&#148; 
              or &#147;innate&#148; characteristics and behavior of human beings&mdash;human 
              nature&mdash;that exist before anyone has a chance to scribble on 
              the blank slate. Not only aggression and sexual differences but 
              also intelligence he acknowledges to be in large part genetically 
              grounded, but on the Big Taboo&mdash;race&mdash;he is vague and even 
              contradictory.</p>
            <p>He endorses the environmentalist theories of the 
              origins of civilization of Jared Diamond and Thomas Sowell as opposed 
              to racial ones, and tells us that &#147;My own view &hellip; is that 
              in the case of the most discussed racial difference&mdash;the black-white 
              IQ gap in the United States&mdash;the current evidence does not call 
              for a genetic explanation.&#148; Yet, six pages later, he tells 
              us that &#147;&hellip; there is now ample evidence that intelligence 
              is a stable property of an individual, that it can be linked to 
              features of the brain (including overall size, amount of gray matter 
              in the frontal lobes, speed of neural conduction, and metabolism 
              of cerebral glucose), that it is partly heritable among individuals, 
              and that it predicts some of the variations in life outcomes such 
              as income and social status.&#148; Combined with the different scores 
              of blacks and whites on IQ tests, of course, this implies that the 
              &#147;most discussed racial difference&#148; has a significantly 
              genetic and not an environmentalist explanation.</p>
            <p>Prof. Pinker also tries to evade the implications 
              of racial differences by emphasizing the universal meaning of human 
              nature. </p>

            <p>&#147;Discarding the Blank Slate has thrown far 
              more light on the psychological unity of humankind than on any differences,&#148; 
              and, further:</p>
            </font>  
            <p>&#147;People are qualitatively the same but may 
              differ quantitatively. The quantitative differences are small in 
              biological terms, and they are found to a far greater extent among 
              the individual members of an ethnic group or race than between ethnic 
              groups or races. These are reassuring findings. Any racist ideology 
              that holds that the members of an ethnic group are all alike, or 
              that one ethnic group differs fundamentally from another, is based 
              on false assumptions about our biology.&#148;</p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s all swell, except that (a) the members 
              of an ethnic group <i>are</i> all alike, in that they are closer 
              genetically to each other than to members of other groups and (b) 
              no one seriously claims that every black is intellectually inferior 
              to every white, let alone that blacks and whites &#147;differ fundamentally.&#148; 
              The point is that modern psychology (and increasingly, biology) 
              shows that blacks on average have significantly lower intelligence 
              than whites. If the norms of a society are to be determined by what 
              is true on average of its members (as social norms almost always 
              are), then the racial differences in IQ are socially significant. 
              How the society will define and institutionalize that significance 
              is another matter, and not one necessarily determined by science.</p>
            <p>What is perhaps more important about Prof. Pinker&rsquo;s 
              book than what he says or contrives not to say about race, however, 
              is how he tries to wiggle out of the implications of discarding 
              the blank slate/noble savage ideology. That ideology has implied 
              that human beings are malleable and that human society can be reconstructed 
              along utopian lines; its proponents, Prof. Pinker writes accurately, 
              &#147;saw the malleability of humans and the autonomy of culture 
              as doctrines that might bring about the age-old dream of perfecting 
              mankind. We are not stuck with what we don&rsquo;t like about our 
              current predicament, they argued. Nothing prevents us from changing 
              it except a lack of will and the benighted belief that we are permanently 
              consigned to it by biology.&#148;</p>
            <p>But if the blank slate concept is not true, it 
              follows that not only the political agenda that sought a perfected 
              mankind and society but also the very ethic that championed such 
              perfection as the morally obligatory ideal is without foundation. 
              If a classless, pacific, racially and sexually equal and non-discriminatory, 
              and far less acquisitive society is not possible, then the moral 
              ideal that demands that we try to create and realize that society 
              becomes at least meaningless and at worst dangerous&mdash;for the 
              simple reason that trying to reach such a goal merely undermines 
              or destroys the existing society with its traditions, institutions, 
              moral values, and disciplines, and enhances political power to the 
              level of outright tyranny.</p>

            <p>Prof. Pinker does glimpse at least part of this 
              truth in pointing out the political horrors to which unrestrained 
              blank slate-ism has actually led. &#147;The Nazi Holocaust was a 
              singular event that changed attitudes toward countless political 
              and scientific topics,&#148; he writes, &#147;but it was not the 
              only ideologically inspired holocaust in the twentieth century . 
              . . the mass killings in the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia and other 
              totalitarian states carried out in the name of Marxism&#148; were 
              also justified by their perpetrators precisely in terms of the blank 
              slate doctrine that Marx and his disciples endorsed. &#147;A blank 
              sheet of paper has no blotches,&#148; Mao Tse tung wrote, &#147;and 
              so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it, the 
              newest and most beautiful pictures can be painted on it.&#148; Prof. 
              Pinker offers as an earlier example of blank slate-ism run mad the 
              French Revolution&rsquo;s Reign of Terror against &#147;aristocracy&#148; 
              and inequality. He might also have mentioned the almost equally 
              ruthless crusade that modern liberalism has waged against racial, 
              social, and economic institutions that barred its path to human 
              perfection. Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray in <i>The Bell 
              Curve</i> and Philippe Rushton in <i>Race, Evolution, and Behavior</i> 
              made much the same points about the bloody legacy of egalitarianism.</p>
            <p>But what Prof. Pinker does not get or at least 
              what he tries to avoid is the conclusion that rejecting blank slate/noble 
              savage theory leads to the rejection of the liberal-radical-progressivist 
              moral ideals and ethic that the theory created and legitimized. 
              Much of his book is devoted to trying to show that liberal morality 
              and the liberal ethic can survive and indeed are not seriously harmed 
              or challenged by the rejection of the blank slate. Thus, with respect 
              to what we now know about &#147;human differences&#148; and the 
              inherent inequality of human beings, he writes:</p>

            <p>&#147;The problem is not with the possibility that 
              people might differ from one another, which is a factual question 
              that could turn out one way or the other. The problem is with the 
              line of reasoning that says that if people do turn out to be different, 
              then discrimination, oppression, or genocide would be OK after all. 
              Fundamental values (such as equality and human rights) should not 
              be held hostage to some factual conjecture about blank slates that 
              might be refuted tomorrow.&#148;</p>
            <p>Read closely, the last sentence is rather amazing, 
              because what it claims is that no matter what science concludes 
              about human nature, the liberal ethic of equality and human rights 
              will remain valid&mdash;that they are, in a word, sacred, beyond 
              dispute, and beyond the limits of scientific falsification. Indeed, 
              much of Prof. Pinker&rsquo;s book can be read as a far-reaching attempt 
              to salvage the liberal ethic of equality and human rights as they 
              are currently understood against efforts by the &#147;right&#148;&mdash;meaning, 
              presumably, &#147;racists,&#148; &#147;sexists,&#148; and other 
              supposed advocates of &#147;discrimination, oppression, and genocide&#148;&mdash;to 
              use the new science of man to challenge that ethic and the political 
              agenda based on it.</p>
            <p>But it just doesn&rsquo;t work, which is why the 
              slowly vanishing champions of the blank slate get so furious whenever 
              someone like Arthur Jensen or Edward O. Wilson or Philippe Rushton 
              or Herrnstein and Murray, et al. challenges their ideology. They 
              know that if human nature is not perfectible, then not only is there 
              no point in trying to perfect it but also there is every good reason 
              not to try&mdash;just as there is every good reason for not trying 
              to make an automobile function like a submarine or an airplane. 
              They will claim that rejecting the blank slate will lead to &#147;genocide&#148; 
              and &#147;oppression,&#148; and while it doesn&rsquo;t, it certainly 
              leads to the rejection of the universalism, egalitarianism, radicalism, 
              and obsession with &#147;rights,&#148; and of the tyranny and genocide 
              these have helped cause and justify.</p>

            <p>If human beings are not blank slates and noble 
              savages of liberal myth, then they are born with certain inherent 
              traits that social reform and political power cannot alter, and 
              at least a prudential ethic can be grounded on these ineradicable 
              traits of human nature. Prof. Pinker is willing to admit that the 
              more extreme versions of utopianism are not possible, but his catalogue 
              of what he affirms as some of the most indelible and unmistakable 
              traits of human nature suggests an entirely different ethic from 
              that of Rousseau, Marx, and Boas. These traits, which he describes 
              on p. 294, include: </p>
            <p>The primacy of family ties in all human societies, 
              which results in nepotism and inheritance.</p>
            <p>The limited scope of communal sharing in human 
              groups, which means people will loaf and will not contribute to 
              public goods if reciprocity is not required. </p>
            <p>The universality of dominance and violence across 
              human societies and the genetic and neurological mechanisms that 
              underlie it.</p>
            <p>The universality of ethnocentrism and other forms 
              of group-against-group hostility, and the ease with which such hostility 
              can be aroused.</p>
            <p>The partial heritability of intelligence, conscientiousness, 
              and antisocial tendencies, implying that inequality will arise even 
              in perfectly fair economic systems; that we therefore face an inherent 
              trade-off between equality and freedom.</p>
            <p>The prevalence of defense mechanisms, self-serving 
              biases, and cognitive dissonance, by which people deceive themselves 
              about their own autonomy, wisdom, and integrity.</p>
            <p>A preference for kin and friends.</p>
            <p>A susceptibility to a taboo mentality.</p>
            <p>A tendency to confuse morality with conformity, 
              rank, cleanliness, or beauty.</p>

            <p>Given that such traits are inherent in human nature 
              and manifest in human behavior, nothing short of massive genetic 
              engineering could create a species capable of realizing liberal 
              ideals. Liberalism (whether the classical version of the 19th century 
              or the modern, social-democratic variety) is characterized by such 
              beliefs as the doctrine of progress (the idea that human nature 
              changes or can change for the better over time), the capacity of 
              human beings to mold their own nature and their societies to their 
              preferences, the equality of human beings and the desirability of 
              a more egalitarian society in power and property, the possibility 
              and desirability of world peace and the end of war, the wickedness 
              of any sexual or ethnic discrimination, the rationality and benevolence 
              of basic human instincts, the illegitimacy of any social or political 
              institutions not based on consent, the primacy of the individual 
              and individual freedom over social obligation, and the universality 
              of natural &#147;rights&#148; that belong to all human beings at 
              all times. What we now know of the biological traits of human nature 
              tells us that all these beliefs are false and that the morality 
              that such traits suggest is not a liberal one.</p>
            <p>Yet it is by no means clear what kind of morality 
              or ethic Prof. Pinker, given his stated views, is capable of coming 
              up with anyway. &#147;The moral sense is a gadget,&#148; he writes, 
              &#147;an assembly of neural circuits cobbled together from older 
              parts of the primate brain and shaped by natural selection to do 
              a job,&#148; and moral convictions &#147;issue instead from the 
              neurobiological and evolutionary design of the organs we call moral 
              emotions.&#148; Since Prof. Pinker has already stated that what 
              is moral (an &#147;ought&#148;) cannot validly be derived from what 
              is natural (an &#147;is&#148;), his naturalistic explanation of 
              the moral sense denies it any genuine authority. Why should we pay 
              any more attention to the promptings of &#147;neural circuits cobbled 
              together from older parts of the primate brain&#148; than to the 
              unpleasant feelings of indigestion or headaches? If by surgery or 
              genetic engineering we could eliminate the moral sense or alter 
              it to suit our preferences&mdash;humanitarian or genocidal as the 
              case may be&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t we? Prof. Pinker&rsquo;s naturalism 
              as far as I can see offers no answer or grounds for an answer. </p>
            <p>In fact, there seems to be no particular reason 
              to think that the new scientific understanding of human nature leads 
              to any new morality or ethic at all, but rather that it largely 
              substantiates what virtually all cultures regard as &#147;traditional 
              morality&#148;&mdash;a morality that assumes the legitimacy of traditional 
              social, family, sex, and race relationships, a morality that evolved 
              naturally because it was grounded in the nature of human beings 
              and was conducive to their survival. The destruction of blank slate 
              foolishness by science, if not by simple common sense, does not 
              so much destroy all morality and ethics as open the door to restoring 
              the old morality. The only &#147;morality&#148; the new science 
              destroys is the false and vicious one concocted by those whose minds 
              are enslaved by blank slate doctrine. </p>
            <p>Prof. Pinker has written an outstanding account 
              of why that doctrine leads to false and vicious consequences, but 
              he remains too wedded to the mythological morality spawned by the 
              very blank slate dogmas he refutes to be able to see that the new 
              ethic that should emerge from the new science of man is very much 
              like the old ethic by which a healthier Western man actually lived 
              before the blank slate myth and its proponents seized power and 
              began pouring their poison into our heads.</p>

  <font size="3">  <p>I suspect Pinker is leaving clues for us in his careful prose:</p>
<p>"The quantitative differences are small in biological terms, and they are found to a far greater extent among the individual members of an ethnic group or race than between ethnic groups or races."</p>
<p>This is true, but it does _not_ imply that there are no significant differences between racial groups. To take a mathematically identical example, consider the towns of Texas and Oklahoma. The minimum distance between a TX and and OK towns is small, for there are towns at, or very near, the state line. However, this does not imply that Houston is near Tulsa. Nor does it imply that the average distance between a TX and an OK town is small. </p>
<p>If we think of our genome data as points in Euclidean space (the number of variables being roughly the number of bytes on a typical DVD), then I imagine blacks, Europeans and Asians would form three well-defined clusters. Such clusters would have poorly defined boundaries, but their centres would be clear. Statistically, their means would be obviously distinct and well-separated, but the variances would be high. [This remains a conjecture at present, since fewer than 10 individuals have been sequenced, but we need only be patient.]Of course, there are individuals with ancestors from several groups, in which case their racial identity would be somewhat arbitrary. For example, why do we classify Halle Berry as black? </p>
<p>I have some respect for Pinker here, despite my suspicion that he's obscuring some his views. After all, as a British academic whose views are mostly restricted to small groups and anonymous posting, I am displaying less courage. Unemployment and social ostracism are strong disincentives.</p></font> <p>Posted

  <font size="3">  <p>"the quantitative differences are small in biological terms"...What exactly does this mean?  If it means that some genetic map reveals small quantitative differences between races this does not imply either that they are unimportant differences or that the map is correct.  In terms of DNA there are relatively few quantitative differences between the genome of a squid and of a man but these small quantitative differences have very serious consequences.<br>
I agree that JJR with his noble savage and John Locke with his blank tablet were both very wrong and that ideologies based upon these false notions were themselves defective.  The doctrine of sense perception which resulted from Hume and Locke's empiricism was clearly unsufficient to explan human knowledge and was replace rightly by the critical philosophy of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.  Experience is the result of an interaction between the given of sense and the organizational functions of mind, not just simple receptivity.<br>
The notion of radical relativism which holds that all views are by nature partial and there incomplete is itself a partial an incomplete view.  What Kant said in response to the sad state of metaphysics the former queen of the sciences in his time was that just as there is a critique of pure reason so too there is a critique of practical reason.  Just as sense experience compells us by its reality (try getting hit in the head by a rock and ignoring it) so too we are equally compelled by notions of duty.  Therefore, just as there is knowledge so to there is morality.  There is both an is and an ought.<br>
The Kantian philosophy recognizes the limites of pure reason (its pure or speculative employment) and the reality and necessity of morality and in so doing recognizes that man does ineed, have a nature.  This fact implies a denial of the blank slate theory and the ideological nonsense that follows from it(Marx).  The concept of the natural savage is contradicted every day by experience and does not deserve any further refutation.<br>
The concept of man having a fixed nature goes all the way back to the Greeks.  This does not mean that the Greeks viewed all men as equal, far frme it.  The Greek notion of man as a rational animal did not extend to hoi barbaroi, barbarians who did not speak Greek.  Aristotle was himself the author of a doctrine of natural slavery.<br>
Race is clearly a reality which has significant implications for us all.  The denial of race as a "small quantitative" feature is entirely unfounded, i.e. does not follow from Pinker's work.</p></font> <p>Posted

plant or animal. Some roses smell sweeter than others; some dogs run
faster than other dogs. Furthermore, average measurements vary among
sub-species. Labradors are larger than poodles. The problem with
egalitarians isn't their denial of "human" nature, it is their denial
of nature period.
<p>
There is a further problem: The members of our corrupt academic elite
are <i>not</i> "egalitarians," they are proportionalists. They agree that
there are variations among humans, but they pretend that there are no
significant biological variations among gender or racial groups of
humans in those attributes that affect things such as general
intelligence.
<p>
"Blank slate" is sometimes a handy figure of speech. Even Sam uses it
implicitly (perhaps intentionally, for the sake of humor) twice in his
article:
<blockquote><i>
  Despite their transparent absurdity, both the blank slate theory
  and its bizarre applications in scholarship and thought have been
  taken seriously by psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists,
  historians, and most other academics, as well as journalists,
  creative writers, and even by Hollywood, whence they have come to
  infect the minds of otherwise sensible people who are not
  professional intellectuals.
</i></blockquote>
<p>and here:</p>
<blockquote><i>
  Prof. Pinker has written an outstanding account of why that
  doctrine leads to false and vicious consequences, but he remains
  too wedded to the mythological morality spawned by the very blank
  slate dogmas he refutes to be able to see that the new ethic that
  should emerge from the new science of man is very much like the old
  ethic by which a healthier Western man actually lived before the
  blank slate myth and its proponents seized power and began pouring
  their poison into our heads.
</i></blockquote>
<p>OK, those are not precisely "blank slate" positions, but if minds can<br>
be "infected" by wrong ideas, if the "poison" of wrong ideas can be<br>
poured into them, we are moving a bit in that direction.</p>
<p>
Based on Sam's review, I'd say that Pinker has documented some
powerful human <i>tendencies</i>, but I'm not sure what we gain by calling
them "human nature." Certainly, we should know enough not to even
think about effecting mass transformations of public thought and
behavior that go against those tendencies, but I believe genuine
exceptions to them do exist. There are probably two or three dozen
people in the U.S.A. who are capable of living communally in a state
of perfect harmony and equality. I hope they use the Internet to meet
up with each other! More importantly, the struggle we are in will
continue to require contributions from people who are a long way from
average: people who are abnormally observant, abnormally intelligent,
abnormally self-critical and abnormally altruistic. In other words,
humans who deviate from some of the human tendencies Sam summarizes
from Pinker's book. In general, we really don't know at what point
human potential stops and "human nature" kicks in, but if we wish to
prevail in this struggle, we will need to surpass ourselves, to the
extent that we can, and go beyond some of those things within us that
are, to use Nietzsche's phrase, "human, all too human."</p></p></p></p></font> <p>Posted
