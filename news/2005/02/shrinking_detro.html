<p><font size="3"><p>DETROIT &mdash; In the decade after he finished law school, Dan Varner watched with mounting exasperation as his black, middle-class peers defected from Detroit, beloved city of his birth. </p>
<p>He was the relentless city booster telling college-bound teenagers to come home after graduation, the one urging far-flung friends to move here, the man always talking about rebuilding the city while others abandoned it. </p>
<p>Then, one day, Mr. Varner said he realized &ldquo;there was really no one to have dinner with.&rdquo; He said he &ldquo;could count on one hand in the four blocks around me the number of men my age who had families.&rdquo; Enough became enough one spring day when he drove his children home past a band of teenage boys chanting profanity. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Varners are emblematic of the exodus that is plunging Detroit&rsquo;s government and school system into a fiscal nightmare, resulting in not just the slashing of staff and services, but also, for the first time, a fundamental right-sizing for a new, shrunken reality. The 139-square-mile Motor City now has a population of 911,000, less than half its 1950&rsquo;s peak.</p>
<p>With the city facing a $389 million shortfall over three years and the threat of receivership, Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick announced this month that Detroit would soon lay off 686 people and eliminate 237 vacant jobs, cut employees&rsquo; pay 10 percent across the board, end overnight bus service and close the aquarium. That is just a start, as consultants consider cutting departments &mdash; like cultural affairs and the zoo, and health, transit and street lighting &mdash; and ponder new taxes on everything from alcohol to vacant land.</p>
<p>In the school district, which must submit to the state by Friday a deficit elimination plan in order to borrow the money it needs to operate, the chief executive, Kenneth Burnley, sent pink slips to 372 teachers before Christmas and plans to shutter 40 schools this summer. That sounds like a lot until it is laid against projections of enrollment plummeting to 100,000 by 2008, half what it was in 1999, which would result in the firing of 5,400 of 21,000 employees and closing 110 of 252 schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Flight is even more furious from the public schools, which have lost 33,000 students since 1998-9, enough to fill 65 elementary schools (21 have closed). Competition that was supposed to promote improvement has instead hastened the district&rsquo;s collapse. Of the 9,300 students who did not return last fall, 3,400 went to charter schools and 1,300 to neighboring suburbs that recruit Detroit residents. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>There are numerous reasons for this and the main one is race.<br>
The end of &#8220;forced&#8221; segregation (force is &#8220;bad&#8221;) and the resulting &#8220;forced&#8221; integration (force is &#8220;good&#8221;) caused two simple actions:</p>
<p>1) White moved away. Since they could not keep white-only schools and apartments in the city, they had to move out of the city to get away from the black influx into the schools/apartments themselves.</p>
<p>2) Blacks, not &#8220;forced&#8221; to live with each other got away from their own &#8220;lower class&#8221; blacks. This took away any redeeming influence the middle and upper class blacks had on their community (same thing happened to Harlem, which during segregation was a real &#8220;up-town&#8221; vibrant community).</p>
<p>You can add to this the black males ability to now chase and marry white women to put the nails in this coffin. Why should any &#8220;normal&#8221; black man stay in the hood when he can follow the white girls to the suburbs and leave his own black women behind. You can thank the removal of anti-miscegienation laws for this travesty and destruction of both the white race and the black family.</p>
<p>Thus, you can see that all that&rsquo;s left is the worst of the worse. Violence, dumbness, meaness, drugs, broken marriages, if any. You can thank the &#8220;paved with good intentions&#8221; liberal-democrats for this destruction of 139 square miles.</p>
<p>In addition, the out-sourcing of auto jobs finished this off. With the Unions demanding pay way out of line to the job, the government piling on taxes, and the regulations, it was only logical the auto plants would move and close. </p>
<p>There is only one solution, but it will never be put in place. The city of Detroit should let a large area, about 50 sq miles be desinated Honky Town. Here, only whites can own property and can sell and buy property only from whites. This will guarantee property values and would cause this 50 sq. miles to sky-rocket in value thus providing all the tax revenue for Detroit City.</p>
<p>Other races can work there, visit the restaurants, etc, but the underlying stability will come from the achievements and long term actions of white people. But it will never be.</p>
<p>Detroit will collapse. Rather than seeing the few miles of destroyed dumps in all US inner cities, you will have 139 of bombed out, destroyed buildings. One entire city.</p>
<p>And this is the future of all American cities.</p>
<p>Only segregation will save us.</p>
<p>A side note. Remember the <span class="caps">TUSKEEGEE </span>(spelling?)AIRMEN? Blacks are so proud of them. But, it was good old segregation that made all of that possible. You don&rsquo;t hear that told, do you? The blacks had their most advanced civilization and cohesiveness and pride during segregation. They were their own &#8220;state&#8221;. Compare that to today. Compare Harlem then to now.</p>
<p>Today, when you see a black pilot you think thoughts of affirmative action. HE is not happy, you aren&rsquo;t and there sure is no black pride it it. Just a thought.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Henry Ford, Sr. was a shameless promoter of black causes in his lifetime.  (His mindless affinity for black people was strangely coupled with a virulent hatred for Jews.)  His sympathy for blacks was one reason why today&rsquo;s Ford Foundation is the left wing organization it finally became.  How ironic that the city made great by this man of such robust civil rights sympathies should now be laid low precisely by the people Ford pandered to all his life.  The wealthy in this country are oddly out of touch with reality, and they care not one whit for you and me.  Let Detroit fail, and let others see what happens when blacks are allowed to run the affairs of a locality.  Go ahead, Ford Foundation&hellip;throw your money at this problem.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>&ldquo;With the city facing a $389 million shortfall over three years and the threat of receivership, Mayor Kwame M.

That is just a start, as consultants consider cutting departments &mdash; like cultural affairs and the zoo, and health, transit and street lighting &mdash; and ponder new taxes on everything from alcohol to vacant land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how can this be? Detroit is the glowing example of how blacks can surpass the &ldquo;wicked white man&rdquo; if just given the chance! An entire city devoted to black &ldquo;pride,&rdquo; &ldquo;civil rights,&rdquo; and &ldquo;culture.&rdquo; They run the whole show, free of the white man&rsquo;s &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and other wicked influences. A city of black ingenuity and skill; it is an unsurpassed black Marxist utopian Affirmative Afropolis. Comrades, can you dig it? </p>
<p>Detroit, is the city where I was born. Detroit and later its suburbs are where I lived for almost my entire life. I still return to the area to visit family and friends on a regular basis; however, I have never regretted leaving that area and short of a miracle, I will probably never move back there! The city is a vacuous black hole, that is literally sucking the life out of the entire state it sits in. The &ldquo;white&rdquo; suburbs that surround it are exponentially being invaded and destroyed by the militantly arrogant and entitlement frenzied blacks that do flee it, along with the Arabs and other Third World parasites that &ldquo;culturally enrich&rdquo; them, beyond all recognition of what they once were, when I was growing up.</p>
<p>What were the suburbs when I was growing up? The safe places, the places where whites who had to live within the city limits, wanted to live! They were almost exclusively white then.<br>
Now areas such as: Wayne, Westland, Allen Park, Southgate, Redford, Dearborn, Warren, East Point, and Southfield are becoming or are already almost as bad as the city itself. Yet, we are to believe all is well in Motown? What utter laughable Multi Cult madness and stupidity. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>Seems like Detroit was okay with White Flight and massive Illegal Alien Immigration until there were not enough Whites left to support all the No-Loads. Now that the house of cards is coming down you can bet they will be looking for Whitey to bail the city out, and the preferred method is tax-payer dollars hi-jacked through feel good liberal government subsidies. <br>

  <font size="3"><p>I bet the Detroit population is even lower than the article claims.   As I recall, the <span class="caps">SEMCOG </span>estimate of Detroit&rsquo;s population was 907,000 in the summer of 2003.  A relative told me recently that he read Detroit&rsquo;s population was under 900,000.  </p>
<p>Blacks are now streaming out of Detroit and into the suburbs.  Last week, in the overwhelming white Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, two blacks shot up a bar/restaurant – (Duggan&rsquo;s Irish Pub), in an alleged robbery attempt.  According to a report I heard on the radio, one victim was shot in the back while he was laying face down on the floor.  Nice touch.  Black criminals always seem to go for the gold.  </p>
<p>In another white suburban community (Roseville), a party store employee was shot in the neck twice (ouch) in a robbery attempt over this past weekend.  Although the race of the two suspects was not mentioned, one can figure they were blacks.  These things just <span class="caps">DON</span>&rdquo;T <span class="caps">HAPPEN </span>in all white communities.  So white people in suburban Detroit can look forward to declining schools and more crime as Detroit blacks stream into their communities.  </p>
<p>One &#8220;economic benefit&#8221; of all this is that it will help continue the &#8220;housing boom&#8221; as white people move from the near suburbs out to the new subdivisions in the BF Egypt suburbs in order to escape problems.  More white flight helps politicians like George Bush tell everyone how &#8220;good&#8221; the economy is by pumping up the home building industry by these disgusting means.  Keeping everyone in debt up to their eyeballs is also a good way to keep them quiet and non-resisting as this assault on white communities continues.   Wouldn&rsquo;t it be &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; if one of these bought politicians would stand up and point at white flight as a serious issue and black crime as something that <span class="caps">MUST </span>be addressed?  You know it won&rsquo;t happen.  Why do you think that is?</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p><br>
&#8220;You can&rsquo;t run a modern western city like a tribal chiefdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Recently on c-span, I watched Barack Obama talk about his trip back to Kenya to see his family after his election victory.</p>
<p>His family was very proud of his win because he was now, in their minds, &#8220;the big chief&#8221;.</p>
<p>He embarrassingly explained that in Africa, &#8220;the big chief&#8221; syndrome was at the heart of tribal life. &#8220;The big chief&#8221; was the one who had absolute power and his family, being Africans believed that since he won an election, he was now &#8220;the big chief&#8221; and could get and do anything he wanted.</p>
<p>He had to explain to them that that&rsquo;s not how it works in the United States; that he&rsquo;s just a part of a larger system.</p>
<p>Really, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a nation in Africa or a neighborhood in the United States, Africans everywhere believe in &#8220;the big chief&#8221; model of government. That&rsquo;s why they go nuts whenever a black wins as major, Governor, representative, senator, etc. They believe once one of them is in power that they then have the right to run the kingdom.</p>
<p>But they have no western governing skills. They can&rsquo;t make the system work for them because it is not their system; it&rsquo;s not in their nature to run things in a White western style.</p>

<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re going to air any dismay over miscegenation, you ought to point out that black men typically only manage to attract the homely, dumb white girls (Tiger Wood&rsquo;s lovely Hallstadt Nordic wife is a disturbing exception).  I&rsquo;m not too worried about miscegenation myself because the black man&rsquo;s poaching on the less desirable white females will have the effect of raising white IQ and racial consciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is only one solution, but it will never be put in place. The city of Detroit should let a large area, about 50 sq miles be desinated Honky Town.&#8221;</p>

  <font size="3"><p>The condition of <span class="caps">DIE</span>troit the result of the toxic-tribalism of Blacks who slavishly follow the late former mayor, &#8220;king&#8221; Coleman Young.  This racist took over in the early seventies and basically started the deline.  The city is thoroughly third-world today because of his &#8220;leadership&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Every cricitism, and I mean every one, Young received regarding his pathetically ignorant planning was loudly denounced as &#8220;racism(!)&#8221; and ignored. The local media cowered.</p>
<p>The city council has been run by hopelessly tribal blacks who have room temperature IQs&rsquo; and maturity levels of adolescents. Scandal after scandal hits, but they just yell &#8220;racism&#8221; and keep on draining city coffers. They love profiling in their ghetto finery and cruising in city owned limos.  This was their pork barrel and they were &#8220;making the white man pay&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Now they have a young &#8220;papa doc duvalier&#8221; in the form of the Kwamee character who has gained the reputation of a party-boy.  As one example of his handiwork, he voted down charter schools in his support for the teachers union, but sends his kids to them. But &#8220;da brutha&#8221; has that afro first name so he&rsquo;s &#8220;down&#8221;. </p>
<p>And this is what the citizens want in a local government.  Detroit politicians can consider their positions lifetime tenured because the citizenry votes them into office every year.<br>
The condition of the city reflects the collective unconscious of tribal blacks and said condition is coming to a community near you.</p>
<p>Crime, unemployment, very high taxes and non-existent city services have been the norm of years. Welcome to Detroit, but bring your own gun for protection.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>Predators always go where the prey is. Whites are easier targets to minority crooks since we lack racial awareness and our instincts to fight back have been &#8220;brain-washed&#8221; out. Why try to rob your equal predator in the inner city and have a gun put in <span class="caps">YOUR </span>face when the weak anti-gun whites in the suburbs are so much easier.</p>
<p>This is a reason why any pro-white person must also be pro-NRA, understand the reason for guns, the need for guns and must own them. It is all one and the same &#8220;big picture&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have just read an article stating the Mayor of Detroit wants &#8220;stonger gun laws&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;.see what I mean? You don&rsquo;t need &#8220;stonger gun laws&#8221; in <span class="caps">ANY </span>white community. This is all so easy.</p>
<p>This article about Detroit is very powerful. We see what happens when a city goes all black. We will live to see an entire State go black, so if the trends are there for your state, <span class="caps">SELL AND GET OUT NOW. </span></p>
<p>Also, if you have a state with a State Income tax, that is the method they will tax you to pay for these black cities. I am sure the state will take the money from the whites out-side Detroit and &#8220;redistribute&#8221; it to the cities. SO watch your taxes go up. If you live in a state with an Income Tax <span class="caps">AND </span>it is going minorit, <span class="caps">GET OUT NOW.</span> At least don&rsquo;t dump this on your kids.</p>
<p>WE &#8220;racist/racialist&#8221; have it easy. Once you become like us, all things make sense. We are not confused and we can predict the future with 100% accuracy. So, when it comes to any Real Estate investment/purchase <span class="caps">ALWAYS </span>look at the race of the area first.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The article refers to <span class="caps">THE </span>school district.  I would welcome more knowledgable commenters, but I will put out a guess that a lot of Detroit&rsquo;s problem is that it had just one big school district that went down the tubes (taking it&rsquo;s whole geographic area with it) due to school desegregation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m postulating that cities that have more school districts tend to do better.  The districts that have a large number of blacks go down the tubes quickly, the districts that were whiter in the 60&rsquo;s were sometimes able to hang on until the courts finally realized that desgregation didn&rsquo;t work.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>&#8220;Seems like Detroit was okay with White Flight and massive Illegal Alien Immigration until there were not enough Whites left to support all the No-Loads.

  <font size="3"><p>A few weeks ago I suggested that bond ratings might start to reflect the racial make-up of the region that issues the bond. A little research indicates that this doesn&rsquo;t apply to Detroit, because bonds related to Detroit draw their backing from the surrounding areas, which provide financial stability. Michigan as a state has a strong financial rating, which means the costs of sustaining Detroit can be bourne by Michigan for the time being. So, it will be possible for this &#8220;financial disaster&#8221; of a virtually all-black city to be hidden from view.

The Broken Window </p>
<p></p>
<p>by Fred E. Foldvary, Senior Editor<br>
If someone throws a stone into a shop window, the owner needs to repair it. This puts people to work and increases total output. Since this creates jobs, would we be better off breaking lots of windows and repairing them? <br><br>
Most folks would say this would be nonsense, since although it would employ labor, there would be no net benefit to society. Yet many similar schemes are promoted by politicians and supported by the public in the name of jobs, jobs, jobs! </p>
<p>This is the &#8220;broken window&#8221; fallacy exposed long ago by the French economist Frederic Bastiat in his essay Ce qu&rsquo;on voit et ce qu&rsquo;on ne voit pas, or &#8220;what is seen and what is not seen.&#8221; Bastiat recognized that what economics should teach us is to understand the economic reality beneath the superficial appearance of everyday economic life. </p>
<p>What is seen is the broken window repairing and the workers that get employed, and the money they in turn spend. What is not seen is that these workers and resources would have been employed in something else if not for the broken window. What ultimately benefits society is not jobs but goods. </p>
<p>There is a minor economics classic book entitled Economics in One Lesson, by the late Henry Hazlitt. Much of the book elaborates on Bastiat, uncovering the unseen economic reality behind bad economic policy. Hazlitt points out that the public will never see the new suit that would have been made had it not been for the broken window. </p>
<p>War is a good example. War puts many people to work. It also puts people to death. After mass destruction, there is mass rebuilding, which is &#8220;good&#8221; for the economy. Does that make war productive? No, since they just rebuild what was there, or shift resources from other goods that would have added to what was there. Hazlitt noted that &#8220;the broken-window fallacy, under a hundred disguises, is the most persistent in the history of economics.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is the fallacy involved when Congressmen resist closing a military base, because it would cost some jobs. What is not seen is the civilian uses that land could be put to, and the housing and jobs that would replace the useless military work. </p>
<p>Hazlitt noted that &#8220;everything we get, outside the free gifts of nature, must in some way be paid for.&#8221; Government spending ultimately comes from taxes. What is seen is the benefits of the spending, and often they are truly benefits to some people. But what is not seen is the goods that would have been bought had the workers not been forced to pay the taxes from their wages. The public as a whole loses, because the gain to some is less than the overall cost to the taxpayers and consumers. </p>
<p>Another economist good at uncovering what is not seen was Henry George. George noted that workers superficially get paid in money. But in economic reality, they are exchanging labor for consumer goods. Superficially, a homeowner is paying interest on a mortgage. In economic reality, the rent from that land is being transferred to the lender who deposited money that was loaned out. </p>
<p>Superficially, rent control limits the rental paid to the landlord. In economic reality, the rent is not reduced, but split among the landlord and tenant. Superficially, we pay taxes on money income and on sales. In economic reality, wages are transferred from workers to landowners in the form of higher rents due to government-funded public works, and folks pay twice, once as rent and again as taxes. </p>
<p>Superficially, we are living in a wonderland of jobs, high tech, and a booming stock market. In economic reality, Americans are wasting a couple of trillion dollars a year from regulations and taxes. In economic reality, inflated land values and coming higher interest rates and other higher costs will someday cause a massive downturn and a depression. The volcanic forces are building up beneath the surface, where they are not seen. </p>
<p>That is the key function of economics: to help us see beneath the superficial appearance to the reality that can only be understood when we learn a bit of economics. We would then know how foolish it is to break windows just to make a job. <br>

  <font size="3"><p> Detroit has been a financial &amp; cultural sinkhole for decades now. It has come to symbolize the devolution of the once-great American city, a scenario repeated throughout the US over the last 35 years. Detroit&rsquo;s downfall was hastened by its financial dependence on a single industry, i.e., auto manufacturing, to sustain its viability. The same thing with Gary, In. &amp; its symbiosis with Big Steel. Foreign competition in the 70&rsquo;s &amp; 80&rsquo;s effectively gutted industries which were still doing business by a 1950&rsquo;s paradigm here in America. What remains is a ghostly remnant of Euro-American achievement, the husk of which is presided over by 3rd-worlders who possess neither the ability nor intelligence to effectively run their cities.<br>
  One of my favorite movies from the 70&rsquo;s is The Omega Man, starring Charlton Heston. He portrays a lone, white survivor in a city taken over by strange, mutated beings, whom he must constantly be wary of &amp; fight against for his very survival. I wonder where the script writers got their inspiration from for the storyline?</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Mr. Kalishnikov (also known as &#8220;Mr. AK-47 ?)above:</p>
<p>Being dependent on one industry, as you say Detroit is/was does not cause a city to decline. If we leave race out of the question, it becomes clear that what destroyed Detroit&rsquo;s car industy is the Unions and the Government.</p>
<p>Unions demanded higher and higher pay for a basically entry level job. THe car companies passed this expense on to the buyers in higher prices and lower quality. Add to this the increased taxes, regulations from all government levels (which the industry passed on in higher prices and lower quality) and you have the reason.</p>
<p>You can keep up the above if you do not let any imports into the nation. With such high costs, taxes and regulations, it is simple for any foreign auto builder to beat either your price or quality&hellip;and thus the Japanese did so easily.</p>
<p>The solution to the problem would have been to immediately lower all wages, reduce all taxes so that the industry could reduce prices and quality to where it would have been without the union blackmail and government extortion.  OR keep out <span class="caps">ALL IMPORTS.</span></p>
<p>WE chose to let in imports, for some reason, but did not lower costs. The industry had to shut down since economics will always win out. </p>
<p>FOr the rest of our economy, the story is the same. All US industry is at risk from China this time. If wages are not lowered and government taxes and regulation eliminated, every  manufacturing job will close.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p><i> If wages are not lowered and government taxes and regulation eliminated, every manufacturing job will close.</i></p>
<p>About that wage lowering and job closing - in a country where the prices of everything are more or less balanced with this income level this will diminish consumption a lot. The cheap imports will be still affordable for some time, but at the end even these will become out of reach. As they are in the countries who produced them. What then? </p>
<p>For e.g., in Europe, there&rsquo;s a constant wailing about the high costs of human work and welfare, which are &#8220;remedied&#8221; by prolonging working hours, lowering of wages (already!), increased additional payments in the healthcare, etc. </p>
<p>However, at the same time, when the unemployment increases, there&rsquo;s almost no growth of industry and the governments pretend to care, <b>new burdens to manufacturing industry</b> are added with high energy prices, ecological taxing (certificates for <span class="caps">CO2 </span>production, more payments for using highways) etc. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>Hmmm, the reasons for Detroit&rsquo;s decline - how about race, race, race, race!  And, how about, race?</p>
<p>Funny thing, I saw two very different Detroit Black women on <span class="caps">O&rsquo;R</span>eilly a while back.  One was a Black Mafia spokeswoman, explaining why it was OK for Blacks to form their own economic council in Detroit, cancelling others out.  One was a Black Christian, who seemed distressed at the suffering pro-Black laws would cause for non-Blacks.  She was very sweet, and while she was talking, I noticed the cynical gleam in the eyes of the Black Power woman.  The other stuff that gleamed was her jewelry, hair, nails, and fine suit.  Whereas the Black Christian was just dressed normally.  It sure pays to be in the Black Mafia!</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>HomoRick who wrote at 6:20pm Feb.4,2005 was correct.  &hellip;segragation made it possible.</p>
<p>The black population had pride and family solitary prior to civil rights, Brown v Board of Ed. and affirmative action.<br>
Madam Walker, a black, made a name for herself in the black Indianapolis community during segregation.  Madam walker made cosmetics for blacks and with her income bought propertyin Indianapolis and made a social theater for blacks.  Look at the history.  The blacks had family, pride and community spirit before the welfare society of the 1960&rsquo;s. Actually, the elite blacks looked as well dressed and prosperous as the elite whites of that time. The black schools were staffed with educated blacks at that time also.  The whole of society has been brought down by liberal social changes.  Let&rsquo;s get out of this &#8220;feel good&#8221; society and take care of our own.  Everyone will advance. </p></font><p>Posted
