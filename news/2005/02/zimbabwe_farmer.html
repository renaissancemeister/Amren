<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4247993.stm">Zimbabwe Farmers Mark New Territory</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Borzello, BBC News, Feb. 9</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White farmers &mdash; evicted from their farms in Zimbabwe during the country&rsquo;s controversial land redistribution policy &mdash; have just been given the all-clear to begin farming in Nigeria&rsquo;s western state of Kwara. </p>
<p>The invitation came from Kwara&rsquo;s state governor, Bukola Saraki, whose goal is to use the farmers to kick-start Nigeria&rsquo;s moribund agricultural sector. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a tobacco farm in Zimbabwe employing around 450 people, but I was chased away two years ago,&rdquo; Dan Swart, a broad man in his late 50s, told me as he and four other white farmers discussed the boundaries of their new farms in a hotel bar. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we were given the offer to come to Nigeria.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&lsquo;Commercial farmers needed&rsquo; </p>
<p>Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, but despite an abundance of fertile land, most of its food is imported &mdash; a legacy of years of corruption and misrule. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Our farming sector is largely driven by peasant farming. And small family groups don&rsquo;t have the capital for mechanised farming or the ability to raise credit from banks. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to have commercial farmers to do that,&rdquo; Governor Saraki said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought: &lsquo;Those are farmers. Zimbabwe doesn&rsquo;t want them. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d rather stay in Africa than go somewhere else&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;So we sent someone to talk to them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The plan is to have 15 Zimbabweans moving to Kwara this month. They will initially live in the bush in tents while they build their homes. </p>
<p>Then, as the months progress, more farmers and their families should fly out. Within a decade, as many as 100 farmers could be based in Kwara. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope &hellip;  in about 10 years&rsquo; time our airport will be busy and young chaps coming out of university will think about going into farming,&rdquo; said Mr Saraki. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Banks will invest in the agricultural sector. And Kwara will be the backbone for Nigeria&rsquo;s agricultural drive.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Overtures </p>
<p>Nigeria is not the only African country to try to woo the 4,000 white farmers who have been displaced. </p>
<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Commercial Farmers Union has also had overtures from Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi. </p>
<p>Some farmers have already resettled in Mozambique and Zambia. </p>
<p>But Nigeria is the first country to offer incentives. </p>
<p>Governor Saraki has promised to help facilitate bank loans, and invest about 300m-400m naira ($2m-$3m; £1m-£1.6m) in irrigation, electricity, roads and housing. </p>
<p>The new farms will be built on land leased for 25 years around Shonga village &mdash; an underdeveloped region of gentle green hills near the state&rsquo;s northern border. </p>
<p>Initial fears </p>
<p>The Zimbabweans have been marking out their territory &mdash; striding around in knee-length shorts under the midday sun with hand-held GPS devices. They have now begun clearing their land. </p>
<p>Initially, many people in Shonga were concerned that the Zimbabweans would steal their land, introduce a South African-style apartheid, and exploit their resources. </p>
<p>But local officials have made efforts to explain that the farmers want to settle in Shonga, employ local workers and pass on better farming methods. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning we had fear as we were not alerted. But now some people have told us about them and we are willing to receive them,&rdquo; said a young mother, standing in the shade of a tree in Shonga village. </p>
<p>Her words were echoed by a motorbike driver on the dusty main street: &ldquo;We welcome them, of course. We hope they will bring us jobs.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Zimbabweans have also asked that no-one is relocated to make way for the farms, although one family will be moved on from their small red brick compound in the middle of the bush. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Mad&rsquo; </p>
<p>But even with this good will, can the project really succeed? </p>
<p>It is a hugely ambitious scheme, and one that invites scepticism. </p>
<p>Nigeria is currently ranked as the third most corrupt nation on earth, and many people do not trust government officials to keep their promises. </p>
<p>It is also a volatile country, with thousands of people killed in inter-communal violence in the last five years alone. </p>
<p>The Zimbabweans, however, are ready to face these challenges and determined to build a new life. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Africa&rsquo;s never easy. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve realised the potential agriculturally. So let&rsquo;s just stick and see what we can do,&rdquo; said Allen Jack, the wiry leader of the Zimbabwean team. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends think I&rsquo;m mad,&rdquo; added Dan Swart. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But once we succeed they will come &hellip;  a lot will come.&rdquo;</p>
