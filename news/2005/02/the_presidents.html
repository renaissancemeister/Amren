<div align="left"><i>Samuel Francis, American Renaissance, May 1998</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>From the very beginnings last summer of President Clinton&rsquo;s &#8220;national dialogue
on race&#8221; and the creation of his Advisory Board on Race, the purpose has
been clear. It not been to initiate or maintain a genuine dialogue that
reaches beyond what the <i>New York Times</i> has called &#8220;banal chatter,&#8221;
let alone to examine in an impartial way the very material threats to domestic
harmony that our current immigration policy and various trends of racial
thought and behavior represent. The real purpose of the &#8220;dialogue on race&#8221;
was evident in Mr. Clinton&rsquo;s own remarks at the time it was initiated,
and it has been apparent in the various hearings the advisory board has
conducted over the last several months.
<p>In his commencement address in San Diego last June announcing the initiative,
the president remarked that &#8220;A half century from now, when your own grandchildren
are in college, there will be no majority race in America.&#8221; Mr. Clinton
is to be commended for being the first president to say what has hitherto
been unsayable – that U.S. Census Bureau projections show that by the middle
of the next century, barely 50 years from now, non-Hispanic whites for
the first time in American history will cease to be the majority of the
U.S. population. That projection, first reported by the Census Bureau in
1992, let alone its cultural and political implications, has yet to sink
into the American public consciousness, and had Mr. Clinton chosen to make
Americans aware of the significance of that transition and its meaning,
I would find no fault with him.
<p>Instead, both the president and his advisory board have taken the demographic
and racial transformation of the United States as a given, an inevitability
that cannot be halted or reversed, and the president himself a few days
prior to his San Diego speech even welcomed the transformation. Speaking
to a group of journalists in Boston, Mr. Clinton stated, &#8220;This will arguably
be the third great revolution in America &hellip; to prove that we literally
can live without in effect having a dominant European culture. We want
to become a multiracial, multiethnic society. We&rsquo;re not going to disintegrate
in the face of it.&#8221;
<p>Again, Mr. Clinton is correct that the racial and demographic transition
from a majority white to a majority non-white population will indeed mean
the end of the &#8220;dominant European culture&#8221; that has prevailed throughout
American history and on which our civilization – our form of government
and laws, our language and literature, our religion, and our manners, customs,
and tastes – is based. Unlike many supporters of an &#8220;open borders&#8221; immigration
policy, Mr. Clinton apparently does not believe that we can alter the racial
composition of our population without also altering the cultural character
of our nation, and if he had seen this transformation as a problem to be
avoided, again, I would have found no fault with him.
<p>Yet the fact that the President of the United States appears to welcome
the end of our &#8220;dominant European culture&#8221; is ominous, since it means that
the chief executive no longer considers that cultural identity to be worth
conserving or even that it can be conserved, and it is in this that the
real purpose of Mr. Clinton&rsquo;s race initiative is to be found. Its real
purpose, in short, is simply to accommodate white Americans to the racial
transformation of their country and the imminent destruction of their culture.
<p>Hence, from that perspective, it is hardly surprising that the board
should spend little time listening to the critics of affirmative action
or that it be so concerned to show that all racial problems in the United
States are really the fault of whites, that these problems can be resolved
only when whites are made conscious of their guilt and responsibility,
and that the guilt and responsibility of whites for racial problems are
rooted in the very dominance of the European culture whose termination
the president welcomes. Nor is it surprising, given that real purpose of
the initiative, that various members of the commission in the last few
months have positively discussed national reparations for slavery or that
the failures, racial animosity, and &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; of non-whites are never
discussed. The president himself set the tone for this way of framing the
&#8220;dialogue&#8221; in his remarks in San Diego last summer. &#8220;We still see evidence
of bigotry from the desecration of houses of worship, whether they be churches,
synagogues or mosques, to demeaning talk in corporate suites.&#8221; &#8220;Bigotry,&#8221;
in other words, is entirely confined to white arson of black churches and
to cases, such as the one alleged against Texaco, of white corporate managers
discriminating against non-whites – both of them instances of &#8220;bigotry&#8221;
that have now been widely challenged if not actually discredited.
<p>The manner in which the public sessions of the race advisory board have
dealt with unexpected expressions of dissent from the public reflects this
intentionally one-sided view of race relations. When the board met in Fairfax
County, Virginia, last December, a white man interrupted its proceedings by
complaining that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no one up there talking about white people.&rdquo; The
gentleman was brusquely removed by police officers, and former Education
Secretary, Bill Bennet, who happened to be sitting with the advisory board that
day, promptly denounced him as a &ldquo;fool.&rdquo; When another white critic of the panel
made similar remarks during one of its sessions in California earlier this year,
he too was summarily bounced by the police.
<p><img src="/news/2005/02/injun.gif" height="269" width="190" align="LEFT">Yet, in March,
at a board meeting in Colorado, 20 American Indians presented similar grievances
about the lack of representation of their own group but did so in a rather
more disruptive way: They donned ski masks, shouted, whooped, and beat
tom-toms, and made it impossible to conduct a meeting at all. When the
commission reconvened the next day, it once again became a shouting match.
No one was called a &#8220;fool&#8221; or removed by police. &#8220;The issues are deeply
felt,&#8221; explained the board&rsquo;s executive director, Judith Winston. And so
they are – at least when they are felt by non-whites.
<p>Of course it is whites who should be whooping about an anti-white inquisition
that is being passed off as &#8220;dialogue.&#8221; We have yet to hear from Mr. Clinton
or his race panel any mention of instances of black or other non-white
bigotry, such as the kidnapping, gang rape, torture and murder of Melissa
McLauchlin in South Carolina in 1992 by blacks in retaliation for what
one of her killers called &#8220;400 years of oppression&#8221; by whites, or the obviously
racially motivated assault, rape, and murder committed against three white
youths by a group of six black men in Flint, Michigan on June 19, 1997,
barely a week after Mr. Clinton&rsquo;s San Diego address, or any number of other
racially motivated crimes committed against whites by non-whites or against
non-whites by other non-whites for ethnic or racial motivations. The chatter
of the &#8220;national dialogue&#8221; is indeed largely banal, but the banalities
are confined to only one perspective and one overriding purpose, that of
holding whites alone responsible for all racial wrongs.
<p>Recent statistics on &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; suggest some truths that the president
and his race commission are unwilling to face. While 66 percent of the
perpetrators of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; in 1996 were white, 20 percent of the perpetrators
were black. In other words, &#8220;hate crimes,&#8221; while conventionally held to
be confirming evidence of the continuation of violent white bigotry and
racism, are in fact disproportionately committed by blacks, who compose
only 12 percent of the population, while whites, composing some 74 percent
of the population, are underrepresented as &#8220;hate crime&#8221; perpetrators.
<p>Aside from deliberate outrages against whites, the responsibility of
non-whites for a legion of their own social failures and problems must
be discussed if the &#8220;dialogue on race&#8221; is to have any real meaning. There
is no need to repeat here the dreary statistics about black crime rates,
illegitimacy, welfare dependency, venereal disease and AIDS rates, unemployment,
and other indices of social failure and social dysfunctions, but it is
increasingly implausible to blame all of them on whites. Nor do I mean
to single out blacks. Hispanics also show similar but usually less dramatic
indications of social failure and dysfunction. The teen-age illegitimacy
rate among Hispanics (at 11 percent) now exceeds that of blacks (at 10
percent), and both exceed the illegitimacy rate for non-Hispanic white
teenagers (4 percent). Hispanics are also more likely than blacks to fail
to graduate from high school.
<p>Taxpayers, particularly white middle-class taxpayers, are the ones who
pay the public burden of these failures of non-whites, and they also are
often the victims of black and other non-white crimes and social dysfunctions.
In addition, of course, the fiscal burden and the administrative impact
of civil rights enforcement, affirmative action, and other state-enforced
privileges for non-whites are also borne by whites, especially white men.
But on top of bearing most of the financial burden for public costs arising
from these non-white dysfunctions, in addition to having to confront every
day the physical danger of non-white violence and crime, and in addition
to enduring the larger national social decomposition that non-white failures
and dysfunctions cause, whites are now told chirpingly by their president
that all racial bigotry is due to them and that the &#8220;dominant European
culture,&#8221; by the norms of which most white Americans continue to abide,
is going to come to an end and that he welcomes it.
<p>The purpose of the president&rsquo;s race initiative, then, whether manifested
in his own words, in the actions of his advisory board, or in what the
advisory board and the president fail to discuss or forbid to be discussed,
is not &#8220;tolerance,&#8221; &#8220;diversity,&#8221; &#8220;harmony,&#8221; &#8220;equality,&#8221; or &#8220;justice.&#8221; The
real purpose is to accommodate white Americans to the end of their culture
and their dominance as a majority of the American nation and as the cultural
core of the nation, and to manage their adjustment to the coming non-white
dominance of the near future. The real issue of the president&rsquo;s race initiative,
then, is, as so many things are, a question of power – in this case, racial
power.
<p>White Americans today are confronted with the two most overwhelming
facts of our time – first, the coming demographic transformation of American
society from a majority white to a majority non-white society, and, secondly,
the emergence of what can only be described as an explicit racial consciousness
among non-whites that identifies whites as their enemies and oppressors,
a racial consciousness that is encouraged and exploited and certainly seldom
challenged by many whites themselves, whether liberal or conservative.
This racial consciousness ranges in its expression from a mild but unquestioned
assumption of non-white solidarity in conflict with whites to outright,
militant hatred of whites, but whatever its form of expression, white Americans
need to ask themselves what will be their fate as a white minority in a
non-white society where the racial demonology created by non-whites prevails,
and they need to think hard about the answers they reach.

White Americans also need to question and indeed reject the very premises
of the president&rsquo;s &#8220;dialogue&#8221; – that the racial and cultural transition
to a non-white America is inevitable or desirable; that whites somehow
possess a monopoly on racial bigotry, the perpetration of racial injustice,
or racial consciousness and solidarity; and that it is morally incumbent
on whites to alter their behavior, their culture, and their sense of moral
and social responsibility in deference to non-white and often anti-white
demands. If there is anything we as a nation have learned since the civil
rights movement thirty years ago, it is that race is a reality, a natural
as well as a cultural and social reality, and that the denial of racial
realities that has been written into our laws, our public conduct, and
our national public discourse is a denial of a major truth about human
beings. Every other race and ethnic group in the United States has learned
or is presently learning this truth, and only white Americans deny it,
deny themselves their own racial consciousness, and deny the threats to
their civilization and to their own safety that their denials invite. If
we are to have a real dialogue on race, then let us have one, but let it
be one in which white Americans engage only if they are able and willing
to claim the identity and the heritage to which they have every right.</font>

<p>Hmmm&hellip;???</p>
<p>This all sounds rather familiar:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goebbels was in good form, delighting his audience with his irony. &lsquo;Welcome, workers of Berlin!&rsquo; he began. &lsquo;Welcome also to a charming young lady, the secretary of Jakob Goldschmidt. And please don&rsquo;t bother to take down every word I say. Your boss will read it all in tomorrow&rsquo;s papers.&rsquo; He went on to speak scornfully of &lsquo;Jew journals&rsquo; and &lsquo;press synagogues&rsquo; until a heckler called out, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t look so good yourself.&rsquo; The man, an elderly pastor, kept interrupting until Goebbels finally signaled his Brownshirts to evict him. In the process the minister was so badly beaten he had to be taken to a hospital.&rdquo;(John Toland, Adolf Hitler, 1976, pg.225.)</p>
<p>Indeed, there are some &ldquo;Ominous Parallels&rdquo; here! And when Mr. Francis notes above, &ldquo;this racial consciousness ranges in its expression from a mild but unquestioned assumption of non-white solidarity in conflict with whites to outright, militant hatred of whites, but whatever its form of expression, white Americans need to ask themselves what will be their fate as a white minority in a non-white society where the racial demonology created by non-whites prevails, and they need to think hard about the answers they reach,&rdquo; a chill runs down my spine. I have been asking myself such questions for a very long time and I do not like, many of the answers I come up with. I am all too certain, that they might find expression in the book by Mr. Toland, for example in Chapter 18, titled &ldquo;Crystal Night&rdquo; (1976, pgs. 501 to 520.)</p>
