<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4248151.stm">Gunman Who Gloated in Rap Jailed</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Summers, BBC News, Feb. 25</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A rap fan who shot a father of three and wrote a song based on the lyrics of rapper 50 Cent about it has been jailed for 25 years for attempted murder. </p>
<p>David Gaynor, 19, was found guilty of shooting David Mullings in the head in front of his wife and child in north London after a row about a damaged car. </p>
<p>Mr Mullings, 32, had been left severely brain damaged, the Old Bailey heard. </p>
<p>Simeon Szypusz, 19, was also jailed for 25 years for his attempted murder. </p>
<p>In addition, Szypusz received a three-year sentence &mdash; to run concurrently &mdash; after being found guilty of making threats to kill. </p>
<p>And Gaynor received a 20-year sentence &mdash; to run concurrently with his 25-year term &mdash; for possessing a firearm. </p>
<p>Lyrics </p>
<p>Judge Kenneth Zucker described Gaynor as an &ldquo;evil, callous and dangerous man&rdquo;. </p>
<p>When Gaynor &mdash; known to friends as G &mdash; was arrested police found lyrics which he had written: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill u in front of your family, G, I knock down family and family trees till there&rsquo;s no branches left.&rdquo; </p>
<p>When prosecutor Bobbie Cheema asked Gaynor if the lyrics were his own, he replied that he had adapted them from a song by controversial rapper 50 Cent. </p>
<p>The court heard that the residents of Meridian Walk in Tottenham had been plagued for months by loud noise and other anti-social activity emanating from one house inhabited by a &ldquo;problem family&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Mr Mullings&rsquo; wife, Jennifer, said the teenagers were drawn to the estate by a pirate radio station which broadcast from a nearby house. </p>
<p>As a result, she said they endured sleepless nights from loud music, screams and shouts from rowdy youths smoking cannabis. </p>
<p>On the morning Mr Mullings was shot she had told him they had to move as she had been made ill with headaches and lack of sleep. </p>
<p>The final straw had come one Sunday morning in May 2004 when a stolen car was crashed into Mr Mullings&rsquo; Honda, badly damaging the bumper. </p>
<p>A large gang of men was hanging around outside the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; house but Mr Mullings, described as a carpenter and caring family man, was not perturbed. He came out into the street, with his wife and his stepdaughter and confronted the drivers of the car. </p>
<p>He demanded to know who was going to pay for the damage and was not pacified by the gang&rsquo;s promises to pay him when he had got an estimate. </p>
<p>Shotgun blast </p>
<p>Szypusz, claiming to have been &ldquo;disrespected&rdquo;, then made a phone call and called in Gaynor. </p>
<p>A masked Gaynor arrived, walked up to Mr Mullings and fired a shotgun at him, blowing a large hole in the back of his head. </p>
<p>Mrs Mullings told the trial: &ldquo;I looked and my husband put his hand to his head and went down. He was hit in the right hand side of his head.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Miraculously he survived the shooting but had to undergo an operation to remove part of a bullet from his brain. He is now out of hospital. </p>
<p>Gaynor&rsquo;s lyrics, scrawled on the back of a letter from his local Jobcentre, also include the line: &ldquo;U wanna die like Scarface, I&rsquo;ll be dat mad one dat kill Scarface. Give us a taste of da pump [pump-action shotgun] and a scar on your face.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Gaynor &mdash; who has distinctive green eyes &mdash; was picked out on an identity parade and was placed at the scene, along with the others, by mobile phone evidence. </p>
<p>He claimed he thought the gun was a replica when he pulled the trigger. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Glorified in rap&rsquo; </p>
<p>Mrs Mullings said: &ldquo;The lowest point of the trial was hearing that the person who has admitted to blasting our lives apart, has sat down and glorified his actions in a rap. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sickening to hear the line &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you in front of your family, G, I knock down family and family trees&rsquo;. I had to leave the court when I heard that. </p>
<p>&ldquo;To glorify such actions in rap rips my soul apart, yet still he has the audacity to say he was sorry.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A spokesman for the Metropolitan Housing Association said the &ldquo;problem family&rdquo; had since been evicted from the house in Meridian Walk. </p>
<p>It is believed they have been rehoused elsewhere in London.</p>
