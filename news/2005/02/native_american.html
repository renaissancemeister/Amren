<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>DAVIS, Calif. &mdash; The state&rsquo;s only college run for and by Native Americans has been forced to close after it lost its accreditation and $1 million in federal funding less than a month into this spring&rsquo;s semester.</p>
<p>Officials at D-Q University shut down the community college, laid off more than two dozen faculty members and staff and sent 200 students home. And while a defiant group of students refused to leave, the beleaguered board of trustees split into two rival factions &mdash; with one firing the school&rsquo;s president.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the commission, D-Q&rsquo;s staff lacked sufficient experience, its board of trustees was too small and lacked training, and the school failed to use &ldquo;established college processes&rdquo; for selection of courses and programs.</p>
<p>The commission also expressed deep concerns about D-Q&rsquo;s financial condition, including its handling of student financial aid packages and an &ldquo;impending financial collapse.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>D-Q University was founded by a group of Native Americans and Chicano activists who in 1970 occupied a former Army communications center for months until the government agreed to allow the 643-acre site to be turned into a tribal college. </p>
<p>The &ldquo;D&rdquo; in the school&rsquo;s name stands for Deganawidah, the &ldquo;Great Peacemaker&rdquo; who helped found the Iroquois Confederacy. According to school literature, the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; represents Quetzalcoatl, &ldquo;an Aztec prophet who symbolizes the principles of wisdom and self-discipline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nonprofit, private, land-grant institution opened in 1971 and first received accreditation in 1977. Some called the school &ldquo;Terrorist Tech&rdquo; because of its origins, but it soon became a source of pride to Native Americans &mdash; a departure from an earlier era when their education consisted of boarding schools whose mission was to Americanize children. </p>
<p>D-Q University&rsquo;s mission was to educate students from a Native American perspective, blending &ldquo;the spiritual and cultural truths of the past, the realities of the present and preparation for the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like other community colleges, D-Q offers associate degrees, but in addition to the standard general education classes, students can study subjects such as &ldquo;ethno-botany,&rdquo; &ldquo;introduction to casino operations and management,&rdquo; mural painting and Native American literature.</p>
