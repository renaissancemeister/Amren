<h1>One in Six Canadians Say They Have Personally Been the Victim Of Racism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ipsos-Reid, Mar. 21</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Toronto, Ontario &mdash; To mark International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Dominion Institute&rsquo;s Passages to Canada programme commissioned Ipsos-Reid to survey Canadians on their attitudes about discrimination and racism in their communities and in the workplace. The survey finds that one in six of Canadians adults (17% or approximately 4,000,000) report that they have personally been the victims of racism. </p>
<p>Approximately one in ten (13%) Canadians believe that racism has decreased in their community over the past five years. Two-thirds (65%) say it has neither increased nor decreased and 17% indicate that it has been on the rise. As for the groups that Canadians believe are most likely to be targeted in their community-Muslims/Arabs (38%), Aboriginals/First Nations (31%), Blacks (28%), East Indians (24%), Asians (14%), Jewish (11%), Hispanics (5%). </p>
<p>And, while most would welcome people, without reservation, from another race if they moved in next door (92%), might marry or have a relationship with someone of a different race (84%), or indicate that the colour of a person&rsquo;s skin does not make a difference in the way they are treated in their pace of work (78%), there are groups of Canadians that think otherwise. Approximately one in ten (7% or 1,680,000 Canadian adults) would not welcome people from another race as next-door neighbours, 13% (3,120,000 Canadians) would never marry or have a relationship with someone of another race, and 15% (3,360,000 Canadians) say skin colour makes a difference in their workplace. </p>
<p>As for those groups or institutions Canadians believe would be most effective in promoting racial tolerance, schools (32%) and families/individuals (30%) top the list. Approximately one in ten cite community associations (13%), the media (13%), and the government (7%). </p>
<p>These are the highlights of an Ipsos-Reid poll conducted on behalf of The Dominion Institutes&rsquo; Passages to Canada programme &mdash; a national network of high achieving immigrants who volunteer their time to talk with schools and community groups about their experiences immigrating to Canada. The Dominion Institute is a non partisan national charity dedicated to the promotion of Canandian history and citizenship. Through its Passages to Canada programme, the Dominion Institute is sending hundreds of high achieving immigrants into schools across Canada on March 21 to share their stories of fighting against racism and discrimination, in Canada and in country of origin. Volunteer speakers with the Institute&rsquo;s Passages to Canada programme include such noted immigrant leaders such as RCMP Sergeant Baltej Dhillon; Vietnam war survivor Kim Phuc; and Air India victims advocate Lata Pada. For more information on the Passages to Canada please visit: www.passages.ca. </p>
<p>Ipsos Reid surveyed a representative randomly selected sample of 1001 adult Canadians by telephone between March 15th to 17th, 2005. With a sample of this size, the results are considered accurate to within ±3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, of what they would have been had the entire adult Canadian population been polled. The margin of error will be larger within regions and for other sub-groupings of the survey population. These data were weighted to ensure the sample&rsquo;s regional and age/sex composition reflects that of the actual Canadian population according to the 2001 Census data. </p>
