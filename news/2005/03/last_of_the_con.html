<p><i>Cathy Young, Boston Globe, Mar. 4</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>Conservatives often complain, with good cause, about America-hating left-wing radicals in academia. Yet in recent weeks, a college professor who co-founded an organization that refers to the United States as an &ldquo;alien occupier&rdquo; in its manifesto &mdash; and whose 2001 essay blaming the &ldquo;barbarism&rdquo; of American policies for Sept. 11 was picked up by Pravda, the Russian communist newspaper &mdash; has received gushing praise on the conservative media circuit.</p>
<p>Meet Thomas E. Woods Jr., assistant professor of history at Suffolk County Community College on Long Island and author of &ldquo;The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History.&rdquo; A main selection of the Conservative Book Club, it has been propelled to the New York Times best-seller list with help from talk shows such as Fox News&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hannity &amp; Colmes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If there are any American heroes in Woods&rsquo;s book, apart from the Founding Fathers, it&rsquo;s the Southerners who fought for the Confederacy. Abraham Lincoln is on the villain side of the ledger.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The full extent of that extremism is camouflaged in the book. The author&rsquo;s official bio leaves out the fact that Woods is a co-founder and member of pro-secession League of the South. Here&rsquo;s a sample of the League&rsquo;s views, from a position paper: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s white Christian Southerners are the blood descendants of the men and women who settled this country and gave us the blessings of freedom and prosperity. To give away this inheritance in the name of &lsquo;equality&rsquo; or &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; would be unconscionable.&rdquo; While generously urging &ldquo;Christian charity&rdquo; toward blacks, the paper denounces the idea that &ldquo;Southerners should give control over their civilization and its institutions to another race, whether it be native blacks or Hispanic immigrants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Woods&rsquo;s own writings for publications such as The Southern Partisan are revealing. In a 1997 essay, he writes that the Confederacy&rsquo;s defeat was the &ldquo;real watershed from which we can trace many of the destructive trends&rdquo; in modern America. He vilifies abolitionists and endorses a Southern theologian&rsquo;s description of slavery&rsquo;s defenders as &ldquo;friends of order and regulated freedom.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a lot more, collected by University of North Carolina professor Eric Muller at www.isthatlegal.org.</p>

<p>What a charmer this Cathy Young must be in person? So we are left to ask this burning question, so Comrade Young since you find this to be so &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; a position on Dr. Wood&lsquo;s part, do you feel that the reverse is a desirable outcome? That is, should Southerners be expected to rapturously just hand over to &ldquo;native blacks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hispanic immigrants&rdquo; control of their civilization and its institutions? I know, I know, that is not what you meant; you just want everyone to hold hands and sing &ldquo;we are the world, we are the children&rdquo; and buy each other a Coke, right? Unfortunately, this is not how the world works Comrade Young! Never forget that while you are wringing your two left hands, over Dr. Wood&rsquo;s &ldquo;covert racism&rdquo; keep in mind, that there are groups such as the Nation of Islam and La Raza who want nothing more than to destroy this country and the race that built it. That would be the <span class="caps">USA </span>and the white race, regardless of regional distinctions; funny, how these groups never bother to urge &#8220;Christian charity&#8221; in our direction?</p>
<p>Indeed, some idiots are useful, but in all the wrong ways.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>  Mr. Woods brings to mind several questions I have about Amren and it&rsquo;s readers. First what&rsquo;s the point of this magazine? If it is to raise race conciousness among whites, well I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to happen. Also do the readers of Amren support repatration of all non-whites? That also will not happen. The bottom line is that the apparent goals of this magazine will never ever happen. Blacks won&rsquo;t return to Africa, hispanics are here to stay, and whites won&rsquo;t (or can&rsquo;t) do anything about it. <br>
  Folks you can complain all day long about other races being here in America, but nothing you can do will change the country so that it&rsquo;s 90 to 100% white. The only thing whites can do is leave, and that may really happen. That this article references the Confederacy may be appropriate because The Confederacy was known as &#8220;The Lost Cause&#8221;.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>She is playing to a small audience, conservatives that hate whites.  She would do better if she were a leftist playing to their mob of white hating &#8220;minorities&#8221; and other social misfits.  For the most part I&rsquo;ll bet that establishment conservatives wish Wood&rsquo;s book would go away because they cannot deny that white men with purpose created a great country and in their time were not so worried about the feelings of non-whites as today&rsquo;s &#8220;ditto heads.&#8221;  That said the real message of Wood&rsquo;s book is that their is a huge market for books like these and to hell with liberal and nonwhite sensitivities.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The poster, Thompson, refers to the Confederacy as &#8220;the Lost Cause&#8221;, which it surely has been and is called. After all, the Confederate States did lose the War. But, the Cause is not lost. Self government, in a system of ordered liberty, is a Cause which will never be lost. That is the Cause for which the Confederacy was fighting. I highly recommend DiLorenzo&rsquo;s book, The Real Lincoln, to any who want insight into the Cause. There are other books such as, When in the Course of Human Events whose author&rsquo;s name escapes me at the moment. People are beginning to escape 140 years of propaganda about the War to understand  that Lincoln&rsquo;s War destroyed the Constitutional Republic, and slaughtered close to 1 million &#8220;white&#8221; americans. I think that is reparations enough, more than enough!!   </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Thompson, you wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;First what&rsquo;s the point of this magazine? If it is to raise race conciousness among whites, well I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites will never <span class="caps">REGAIN </span>the sense of racial consciousness they once had as Germans, Swedes, Italians, Greeks, Irishmen, etc. (and lost through assimilation) unless someone starts speaking out for the premise that whites, too, have group interests   &mdash;   just like blacks, Latinos, Asians, and Semites (Arabs &amp; Jews).</p>
<p>I disagree that whites are incapable of having their consciousness raised.  Unfortunately, things usually have to get pretty bad before most whites will speak candidly about what is causing their communities and schools to go downhill.</p>
<p>People are more likely to stand up for themselves if they see others doing it without the sky falling on them.  After 14 years it hasn&rsquo;t fallen on Jared Taylor, who gets more and more exposure as time goes by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also do the readers of Amren support repatration of all non-whites?&#8221;</p>
<p>I, personally support the deportation of all illegal aliens and a stop to all non-white immigration, even for &#8220;family reunification&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks won&rsquo;t return to Africa, hispanics are here to stay, and whites won&rsquo;t (or can&rsquo;t) do anything about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites won&rsquo;t begin to assert <span class="caps">THEIR </span>group interests if everyone takes a defeatist attitude.  Blacks and Mestizos are not going to disappear, but that does not mean whites should allow themselves to be exploited. </p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing whites can do is leave, and that may really happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>It already has.  In the 1950&rsquo;s the city of Detroit had a population of approximately 2,000,000, and a stable, mostly white, middle-class.  Today the city&rsquo;s 70% black population is down to 950,000 and Detroit is a basket case.</p>
<p>Move to the burbs?  With open housing laws and Section 8 blacks may eventually follow.</p>
<p>Whites cannot keep moving away from the problem indefintely.  Without a strong sense of racial consciousness they will never have the moral, physical, and political will to stand up to the lesser races that would devour them.</p>
<p>Blacks are tough in a group.  But one-on-one, out in the open, facing a white man who is sick and tired of all their <span class="caps">BS, </span>it&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>Ditto with our amigos from south of the border.</p>
<p>The reason blacks and Mestizos are so brazen in their demands is because too many whites do nothing when somebody takes a leak in their corn flakes.  In the LA riots back in 1992 the blacks and Mestizos didn&rsquo;t fear the <span class="caps">LAPD.</span></p>
<p>They feared the Koreans   &mdash;   who were armed to the teeth and made it very clear they would not hesitate to kill anyone who threatened their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Unlike the Confederacy, the race that made Westrern civilization is not a lost cause   &mdash;   just a race that needs to begin to look out for #1.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Cathy Young, contributing editor to Reason magazine, writes, &ldquo;Unfortunately, whatever solid arguments this book has can only be tainted by association with Woods&rsquo;s [sic] ultra-reactionary extremism.&rdquo;  Solid arguments can be tainted?   Unfortunately Young&rsquo;s logic is tainted by her stupidity. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a piece of Lincoln that every school child should commit to memory instead of the vacuous Gettysburg Address.  From page 66 of Woods&rsquo; work, </p>
<p>    &ldquo;[t]hat I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters and jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the black and white races which I believe will forever forbid the two races from living together on terms of social and political equally.  And inasmuch as they can not live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.&rdquo; <br>

  <font size="3"><p>Thompson: I would venture that almost no Amren readers seriously treat a 90-100% majority, or the relocation of hispanics and blacks as a feasible goal. Raising white consciousness to a level where Whites act collectively in a way that is not suicidal, is feasible however. Whether Amren will have an appreciable enough effect is another matter. I personally feel the prospects are much more promising than you do. Which leads me to ask, if it&rsquo;s all so hopeless, why bother posting to tell us?</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Noneknown: &#8220;Lincoln&rsquo;s War destroyed the Constitutional Republic, and slaughtered close to 1 million &#8220;white&#8221; americans. I think that is reparations enough, more than enough!!&#8221; </p>
<p>I think we have to get completely away from the idea that the Blacks are owed something for slavery. The Blacks that the slavers missed. What happened to them? They didn&rsquo;t spend a few generations being well fed on planatations, getting a good grounding in music and basic hygiene, then learning how to manipulate White liberal guilt. No sir, most of them died horrible deaths of cannibalism, disease, starvation, or just being hit on the head with a knobbly stick. </p>
<p>Africa couldn&rsquo;t support its excess population, so the slavers were actually saving lives! Not intentionally, of course, but saving lives nonetheless. As slavery saved a large part of Africa&rsquo;s excess population from dying, it can rightly be claimed that it was nothing but good for Blacks. Africa had limited food resources and no means of settling its excess population elsewhere. Slavery probably saved more Black lives than decades of Western aid has done. It also spread Black <span class="caps">DNA </span>(with its criminal and anti-social tendencies) across much of the World.</p>

<p>Not so fast. There are plenty of events that could precipitate an out-migration of non-whites: war, legislation, economic conditions, disease, natural catastrophes, etc. Who knows what will happen 10, 15, or 20 years from now. Demography is not fixed.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, the current demographic changes underway in America are not a natural phenomenon, but are almost entirely the result of government legislation. Which means, they can easily be reversed by government legislation, if the power elites found the will to do so. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>Why is it that whenever I read articles about the noble South, the writer always seems to leave out the pertinent point that it was the Southerners who wanted to have blacks in the US?</p>
<p>The people of the South refuused to see two things:  1. Slavery is wrong.  and  <br>
2.  There was no way the society they created would last forever.  In other words, the slaves would one day be free and what would that mean?</p>
<p>Well those of use today are reaping what our ancestors have sown.  For their short term gain, they sold our futures down the river - much as the pro-immigration crowd is doing today.  That&rsquo;s why I like to refer to the pro-immigration crowd (especially the corporate interests, see the Home Depot article) as the Modern Day Slave Trade.  They&rsquo;ll make their money and live well in their life times, but what do they leave to their decendants?</p>
<p>The South, unfortunately, is guilty of the same shortsightedness.  They even wanted to annex Cuba so they could bring in more slaves and some violated Federal law by importing more slaves directly from Africa.</p>
<p>Had they South succeeded we might be even worse off today.  Jefferson had seen years before the war that the slaves would one day be free.  Everyone should have known it, acknowledged that fact, sacrificed, and planned for a better future for their descendants.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t and that is one of the reasons we are on this forum today facing the problems handed to us from past generations.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I agree with Willy.  Not so fast  &mdash;  many thing can happen in the future  &mdash;  things that may be &#8220;unimaginable&#8221; to your typical liberal reporter.<br>
The amrican civil war was not only or primarily a war to preserve the institution of slavery.  It was also about preserving the consitution and the rights of the states versus the federal government.  There is no question that Lincoln was a dictator responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of his fellow citizens, that he regarded blacks are inferior to whites and not able to live in white society as equals, that he effectively destroyed the constitution and is responsible for the greatest and most systematic violation of civil rights in the North and that his own solution to the black question was forced repatriation.<br><br>
If you would like to learn more about good old Abe I sugest reading The Real Lincoln.<br><br>
In regard to views of blacks inferiority you can add every one of the founding fathers.  If you think that blacks and whites are equal, I suggest you do a bit more reading and perhaps visit one of the black enclaves in one of our inner cities on your own without a gun.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>he South was evil, slavery is horrible, and the Southerners then and pro-Southerners now are hypocrites&hellip;.America is a free enterprise, capitalistic civilization; slavery is anti-American, not paying a man for a day&rsquo;s work is demented and disgusting. Lincoln did not kill all the Civil War mortalities, lazy Southerners did. If you guys don&rsquo;t like our way of life, why don&rsquo;t you guys move to Africa where slavery is legal?</p>
<p>1)&#8221;the south was evil&#8221;-this is the most absurd comment to come my way in quite a long time; the south was an agrarian econmy which produced such evil individuals as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, etc.  The average southerner was not a slave holder.  The condition of the average slave in the antebellum south was significantly better than that of the white working classes in most of europe and in many places in the US at the time.  The southerners were forced to pay taxes to support protective tarrifs for northern industries.  As a result of the fanatic abolisionist in the north they were increasingly attacked, their constitutional rights denied, and politically dispossesed.  The south supported the constitution and the supreme court  &mdash;  the north did neither.  The moral code of the southern gentelman was the same moral code of Thomas Jerfferson, et a. and decidedly superior the that of the comercial north.<br>
2)&#8221;slavery is terrible&#8221;  &mdash;  slavery was a universal institution in both Greek and Roman antiquity; as an economic institution in the south it was resonably efficient; most slaves were contented with their lot which was far superior to that of their fellow tribsemen who had sold them in the first place.<br><br>
3)&#8221;southerners were hypocritics&#8221;  &mdash;  southerners beleived in the constitutionally founded states rights doctrine; they believed in a federal system in which the states, as the parties to the constitutional convention, were prior both temporally and in theory to the federal government; they believed, along with the vast majority of all americans at the time that blacks were inferior; when they were threatened by Lincoln&rsquo;s election and his subsequent mobilization of 70,000 troops they succeeded from the union and established their own militias for purposes of self defense  &mdash;  remember no southerner wanted to invade the north  &mdash;  southerners just wanted to be left alone to govern themselves  &mdash;  for that desire, they had their teritory invaded by armed troops and they fought back  &mdash;  hardly hypocritical; they fought for their beliefs and died for them.<br><br>
4)&#8221;slavery is anti-american&#8221;: this is another comment that could only be made by one totally ignorant of history; slavery was present at the founding of this country; southern slavery was protected by the constitution  &mdash;  remember Dred Scott?, remember the Fugitive Slave Act?  &mdash;  slavery was an american institution until 1865.<br><br>
5)&#8221;Lincoln did not kill all the war mortalities&#8221;: the South desired to succeed, a principle universally recognized as a valid state perogative at the time; it did not declare war on the north; Lincoln declared war on the South and raised an army to invade and destroy the south  &mdash;  Shermn&rsquo;s march to the sea was one part of the new northern concept of total war  &mdash;  I live in central Virginia and the effect of Lincoln&rsquo;s war are still evident in the central valley; all the south desired was to be left alone  &mdash;  the war which went contrary to the constitution was begun and ended by the Lincoln administration  &mdash;  so, no, it was not the South&rsquo;s fault; the responsibility for all of the hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded, for the widespread devestation was that of the North alone<br><br>
6)&#8221;lazy southerners&#8221; responsible for the deaths  &mdash;  the north initiated the war and had quite a difficult time winning it, even though it was superior in financial power, manpower and industrial capacity and systematically suspended civil liberties in the north  &mdash;  remember Manassas and all the other southern victories against numerically superior opponents; remember Stone Wall Jackson, Robert E Lee and so many others  &mdash;  call them what you want, but &#8220;lazy&#8221; is not one of the things that can fairly be said about any of the confederate soldiers<br><br>
7)&#8221;if you guys don&rsquo;t like our way of life why don&rsquo;t you move back to Africa where slavery is legal&#8221;  &mdash;  no one is endorsing slavery and none of the southern groups such as the league of the south endorse slavery  &mdash;  so that is what is called a &#8220;straw man&#8221; agrument  &mdash;  as far as &#8220;our way of life&#8221; goes, whose way of life are you referring to?  &mdash;  the northern way of life or the liberal way of life or the would have been a comunist but was too stupid to understand Karl Marx way of life?  For your information, the south is part of the United States, unfortunately, and &#8220;our way of life&#8221; encludes southerners too.  I would be very happy if it didn&rsquo;t and if we could finally succeed from the rest of the country so as to have a chance to preserve our culture, but I don&rsquo;t think our northern masters would like that too much.<br><br>
Finally, I would suggest that you finish elementary school and then do a little reading before expressing opinions which reflect so poorly on yourself, your gross ignorance and your purile arrogance.</p></font><p>Posted

All of the Founders, Jefferson for example, saw slavery as wrong. <span class="caps">R.E.</span> Lee saw slavery as wrong. You must view history in context, as much as possible. Slavery was a long-standing institution (by the way, Yankee traders brought most of them across.) No one I know who defends the South today, does so to defend the institution of slavery. Slavery was/is abhorrent! Defenders of the South are defending the Constitution, the right of self-determination, the right of States, as sovereingn entities to manage their own affairs without federal intervention.

Excellent post. Wake up to reality folks. Human nature will always want more. The slave will always yearn for and seek freedom, no mater his deficiencies. Feudalism (Pax, Richard Weaver) is a flawed system - defying human nature and thus doomed to collapse. Had it not been the dictatorial Lincoln, it would have been something or someone else.</p>
<p>Westward expansion was making civil war almost unavoidable (though I, perhaps foolishly, cling to the belief that it could have been avoided).</p>
<p>It is the South, ultimately, who bequeathed themselves and their fellow white bretheren (Yankees) the overwhelming majority of todays &#8220;African Americans&#8221;. Blame Lincoln for &#8220;Emancipating Slaves and Enslaving Free Men&#8221; as the book title * says, but not for recognising (as quoted by &#8220;P Noctura&#8221;, above) the utter disastrousness of the Southern system of African slavery.</p>
<p>Jefferson, Monroe and all the other founders of Liberia saw it. <br>
I have to believe that pure greed for gain blinded those whites most involved in and committed to the mad project. I don&rsquo;t mean Lee or Jackson or any other superb hero, great or small, of the Confederacy. I mean the money boys, whose influence and power led to very good white men, great and small, being pulled their way. I see the same thing today in good whites supporting open borders and free trade &#8220;conservatism&#8221;. (Interestingly, the South was totally sold out to free trade, while Lincoln despised it.)</p>
<p>White people feuding, waring, bloodletting one another and working against the interests of one another, sometimes even against the interests of all of mankind, down through European/American/Western history, is a profound tragedy. For all our great accomplishments and abilities, we have this very human habbit of self inflicted trauma. </p>
<p>It is Aristolean, if one can speak of a mass of mankind of great character and stature (rather than a single person) having a fatal flaw. </p>
<p>By the way, &#8220;The Dalry Lama&#8221; brings out a dichotomy that is a hidden truth about the slavers. In spite of the horrors and death that were taking place, a providential hand worked out physical (not to mention spirtual) salvation, through this abominable human trafficking for perhaps millions of otherwise doomed Africans.</p>
<p>The state and condition of Africa and the (even unintended) benefits of almost any intercourse with whites is bitterly, blindly denied or ignored by almost all black people; certainly by almost all of their intelectual class.</p>
<p>Gratitude for any blessings from whites, be those blessings past or present, is absent from all but a handful of black folk.<br>
   <br><br>
Neo confederatism, as I see it, denies the lessons of both flawed human nature and history.</p>
<p>What did Dr. Francis call neo-confederatism? Something like a silly affliction. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>From my studies on the Civil War, I had to conclude that the biggest contributing factor was - slavery.</p>
<p>As <span class="caps">DTF </span>pointed out, westward expansion virtually sealed the deal, as did our victory in the Mexican War.  The South was afraid of having slavery voted out of existence and was demanding equal amounts of slave states to free ones – not exactly a &ldquo;just leave me alone&rdquo; attitude.</p>
<p>The South, and in particular Robert E. Lee, was hypocritical.  The South did not mind Federal intervention when the decisions were the ones they approved of.  When Federal courts ruled that former slaves found up North must be returned to their owners, the South had no problem with Federal soldiers walking into the courtrooms of Northern states to retrieve those slaves and escort them back to the South.  I believe Lee participated in escort duty himself.  He also acted as a Federal in the Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, VA incident involving John Brown.  He didn&rsquo;t see a conflict of interest in these cases because they favored the Southern view, but when offered the command of Union forces he declined and took up arms against the Federals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note when secession actually took place.  South Carolina seceded just because they didn&rsquo;t like the fact that the nation as a whole elected Lincoln as President.  He wasn&rsquo;t even given a chance to govern.  Then they fired on Fort Sumter because it was being re-supplied.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that had slavery not existed in the <span class="caps">US, </span>we would not have had the Civil War.  Slavery and how and where it would be implemented was the pivotal issue.</p>
<p>One last thought - it is an irony of history that both the South and Nazi Germany, through their actions, facilitated the advancement of exactly what each feared.  In the South&rsquo;s case, the slaves were freed, integration and interracial marriage occurred, and the Federal government became enormous, dominant, and overly intrusive.  In Germany&rsquo;s case, the World War II generation is not even gone and yet Germany is smaller than ever, will never again be a world power, and is overrun with non-white foreigners.  With patience how long could the South have preserved its culture?  With patience, how long would Hitler&rsquo;s Reich have lasted?<br>

<p>All you good ol&rsquo; Rebels:</p>
<p>Please see my comments attached to the AmRen article &#8220;Remebering Sam Francis&#8221; (March 1), and remember to keep the Faith; our northern bretheren are yet coming to the realization that they were betrayed by the Black (Radical) Republicans too!     </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to read history written by the victors recording their claims that their defeated enemies acted irrationally, but I caution against believing it whole cloth.  The truth is that both the Third Reich and the American Confederacy probably had a hell of a lot better grasp of the facts on the ground than you, I, or any historian ever will have.  I find all the historians who second-guess this or that sweeping movement of history (not details, but the movements of nations and empires) just as compelling as any other Monday-morning quarterback; that is to say, not at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not why I wanted to comment.  I wanted to comment to find out just what the hell is &#8220;ironic&#8221; about the fact that the Third Reich and the Confederacy opposed something, lost, and now we see those things they opposed running amok?  That isn&rsquo;t irony, that&rsquo;s cause and effect.</p></font><p>Posted

      <a id="c30972"></a>
  <font size="3"><p>Svigor, hope you looked for a reply.</p>
<p>First of all, my point was that the actions of the Confederacy and the Third Reich accelerated what they opposed or feared.</p>
<p>No Monday morning quarterbacking at all on these points:  It is obvious that the South&rsquo;s way of life was &#8220;Gone with the Wind&#8221; and it was even worse for Germany - just look at the sadness of what was once Prussia.  Every German was forcibly removed and the country is now officially part of Russia.  </p>
<p>The only Monday morning quarterbacking would be on the timeline or methodology the South and the Third Reich chose.  In the case of the South, I think their entire outlook was skewed.  Slavery and bringing Africans to the US was a bad idea for the future of America.  </p>
<p>The Third Reich is more complicated.  It appears that Hitler had the insight to see that if Germany remained as it was, eventually, she would be vulnerable to the larger nations of the world.  He saw the only solution was for Germany to ensure it was one of the big players too.</p>
<p>I have to agree with some of the commentary I&rsquo;ve read on Hitler that says he became like an out of control gambler.  Had he stopped short of invading the <span class="caps">USSR, </span>he may have been able to hang onto what he had.  But not only did he invade Russia, he declared war on the <span class="caps">US. </span> Perhaps war with the US was inevitable, but as Japan had attacked the US not the other way around, Germany was not under obligation to declare war.</p>
<p>Speculation about the invasion of Russia could take pages which as you said is Monday morning quarterbacking.  However, it was a huge gamble and he knew it was a gamble.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>So sorry, much apoligies. I am an internet novice really. I copied the address and pasted it to my <span class="caps">AOL </span>address thingy and hit go. It went right to the article on the <span class="caps">STALKING THE WILD TABOO </span>site. Also, If you go to <span class="caps">VDARE </span>and page down to the article on the left side from February 26, entitled: &#8220;His legacy will live on&#8221; Sam Francis <span class="caps">RIP </span>by Marcus Epstein you will find the link clearly highlighted in the article as the words &#8220;infantile disorder&#8221;.</p>
<p>The article is brilliant and deep. I don&rsquo;t believe Dr. Francis was attacking anyone. He acknowledges that he is alone among his <span class="caps">CHRONICLES </span>colaborators in non membership in the League of the South.</p>
<p>I hope the article is helpful. Best regards and to all my beloved &#8220;Rebel&#8221; white brothers.<br>
