<h1>UMC Abuse Suspicions Were Ignored</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patty Machelor, Arizona Daily Star, Mar. 13</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>During the quiet early morning hours at University Medical Center, a sexual predator worked for 23 months, preying on vulnerable surgery patients while convincing his supervisors nothing was amiss. </p>
<p>Daniel Lugo Perez, a former UMC patient-care technician, was sentenced this month to 57 years in prison for using his fingers and fists to sexually assault three bone-surgery patients. </p>
<p>Though Perez&rsquo;s criminal case is over for now, police are investigating two more possible attacks at UMC and allegations he assaulted a 6-year-old girl in South Tucson. </p>
<p>For his victims, the question remains how Perez was able to work for two years at a hospital that has received nationwide honors for nursing excellence. The answer appears twofold: The hospital&rsquo;s failure to call police, and staff members&rsquo; disagreement or misunderstanding about patient care policies and procedures. </p>
<p>Court documents, trial testimony and pretrial interviews provide insight into what happened, and didn&rsquo;t happen, after Perez began working with patients in July 2002. The interviews were conducted in January 2005 by a prosecutor and Perez&rsquo;s lawyer, in the presence of hospital attorneys. </p>
<p>At least three UMC nurses thought Perez was staying too long in female patients&rsquo; rooms. Just as many became suspicious of his behavior. But little was documented or communicated &mdash; even after a patient repeatedly accused Perez of assault and the hospital investigated. </p>
<p>One nurse who spoke out was pegged a racist. Her observations the night of an assault last June &mdash; the attack that led to Perez&rsquo;s arrest &mdash; were twice discounted by a supervisor. Another supervisor recorded the nurse&rsquo;s account, but his notes were not given to a prosecutor until five days before Perez&rsquo;s trial. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was the night of June 9 that nurse Louise Oyler was disturbed to find Perez massaging the back and hip area of a spinal surgery patient, Eleanor Torres, 54. Oyler said she had never seen a patient-care technician massaging a patient before. </p>
<p>Oyler told Jorinda Hall, a registered nurse who was in charge that night. </p>
<p>Hall wasn&rsquo;t alarmed, according to her pretrial interview. She said patient-care technicians sometimes do massages. She did not report the allegation to her supervisor. </p>
<p>The prosecutor, in questioning Hall, said she&rsquo;d been told massages by male staff on female patients are &ldquo;a big no-no.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, like I said, that was my second time ever being in charge there. I didn&rsquo;t know their procedures,&rdquo; Hall said. </p>
<p>Later, nurse Oyler found Perez standing next to Torres and pressing his body against her arm as she used the bedside commode. He hadn&rsquo;t left to give Torres privacy, as he was supposed to, Oyler said. Then she noticed he had an erection. </p>
<p>Oyler said she pointed to the door to get Perez to leave. Again, she told Hall of her alarm. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It did cause me some concern, but honestly, I didn&rsquo;t believe it because of the previous things that Louise had said to me about Daniel,&rdquo; Hall told prosecutor Eazer during a pretrial interview. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t like him. She couldn&rsquo;t stand him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Eazer said. &ldquo;I understand everybody on the unit was talking about Louise and how prejudiced she was and nobody believed her but in the end it looks like everybody should have.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Torres knew nothing of what nurse Oyler had observed when she first told her daughters, and then hospital staff members, that Perez had assaulted her. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What they did to me was absolutely horrendous. They had an eyewitness, and they ignored her,&rdquo; Torres said. </p>
