<h1><a href="https://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=4295366">Car Park Sign Asbo &lsquo;A Joke&rsquo; Says Pub Landlord</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liam Creedon, PA (UK), Mar. 24</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man who was made subject to an Anti-Social Behaviour Order for putting up a sign saying &ldquo;porking yard&rdquo; in his pub car park, because it was offensive to Muslims, today described the court action as &ldquo;a joke&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Leroy Trought, 42, was given a two-year Asbo at a hearing at Bristol Magistrates&rsquo; Court on Monday.</p>
<p>Magistrates ordered him to change the wording of the &ldquo;porking yard&rdquo; sign at The Swan With Two Necks in St Judes, Bristol, to &ldquo;parking yard&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He was ordered not to display any signs that may be threatening, abusive or insulting at the pub, which is next to a Somali mosque.</p>
<p>The order was sought by Avon and Somerset Police and Bristol City Council after a series of complaints from residents in the St Judes area.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Bristol City Council said: &ldquo;The Asbo was sought after we received a number of complaints from the wider community who found the sign to be racially and sexually offensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mr Trought today said that imposing the Asbo was a joke.</p>
<p>He said the sign was intended to commemorate the large number of butchers&rsquo; shops that used to be located in the area and he had never intended to cause any offence.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We ran a competition in the pub to think of a funny name for the car park and one of the customers came up with the name &lsquo;the porking yard&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grew up in Bristol so I know that this area has traditionally had a lot of butchers. It was always known as &lsquo;pork alley&rsquo; so &lsquo;the porking yard&rsquo; just seemed to fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a butcher across the street that has been here for more than 100 years. It&rsquo;s political correctness gone mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of the day to receive an Asbo for this is a joke. We had no intention to cause any offence whatsoever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What really annoys me is the complaints that the sign is sexually offensive. Well, I can&rsquo;t see anything sexual about it. The people who thought that must have dirty minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somali-born Khalil Abdi, who is street warden in the area, said the sign was deliberately provoking the Muslim community.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Bristol Evening Post, he said: &ldquo;Because of my faith I am required to attend the mosque in the education centre to pray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regularly use the learning centre in Wade Street, which is near to the pub, with my fellow Somali friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muslims do not eat pork but the sign has a picture of a pig and the words &lsquo;porking yard&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends and I were angered and upset by the sign and we have welcomed the court ruling ordering the sign to be changed. I definitely think it is provocative and insulting to Muslims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beat manager Adrian Williams, of Avon and Somerset Police, welcomed the Asbo.</p>
<p>He said he had received complaints about the sign from school teachers, community leaders and members of the Somali community.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We are very pleased that the order has been made following complaints from the community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shows that this kind of behaviour, which is provocative, will not be tolerated.&rdquo;</p>
