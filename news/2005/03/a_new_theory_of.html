<p><i>Race, Evolution, and Behavior</i> is
one of the most important books about race to be written in many years.
Not only does it describe the myriad ways in which the races differ, it
advances a persuasive and original explanation for what these differences
mean and how they came about. Prof. J. Philippe Rushton of the University
of Western Ontario has written a rigorously scholarly book that is not
always easy to understand, but it could well become a classic in its field,
like Race by John Baker and <i>Bias in Mental Testing</i> by Arthur Jensen.
<p>Just how different are the races? Most experts now take differences
in intelligence for granted. Prof. Rushton has gone much farther and marshaled
a wealth of data on other important differences. Some of these are summarized
on page 3, in a chart that deserves close examination. The most striking
finding is not just that Asians, whites, and blacks are different, but
that the differences fit a pattern, with Asians and blacks at opposite
ends of a spectrum, and whites in the middle.

A large part of the book – and a good portion of this article – are devoted
to reviewing these data, but Prof. Rushton&rsquo;s most provocative and original
contribution is his application of what is called<i> r-K</i> theory to
this pattern of Asians-whites-blacks. The main features of <i>r-K</i> theory
are represented graphically in the drawing on page 3.
<p>
Different species have evolved different approaches to propagation.
At one extreme is the <i>r</i>-strategy, by which an organism produces a very
large number of offspring, but gives them little or no care. The oyster
is a good example. Every year it releases millions of eggs into the ocean
and leaves them to the mercies of weather and predators. Almost all of
them die, but a few survive.
<p><i>r </i>organisms must mature quickly because they get no help from their
parents. The ones that survive repeat the cycle by producing huge numbers
of eggs, only a few of which will live. The symbol <i>r</i> stands for
the maximum rate of increase in a population, and when the conditions for
reproduction are good, an <i>r</i>-strategist can increase its numbers
at a terrific rate.
<p> At the other extreme is the <i>K</i>-strategy, which is used by more
advanced animals, including man. The number of offspring is much smaller,
but great effort is taken to give each one a good chance of survival. <i>K</i>-
and <i>r</i>-strategists consequently are very different both in biology
and in what Prof. Rushton calls life histories.

</table><i>K</i>-strategists live longer, have larger brains, and take longer
to reach sexual maturity. Unlike the simpler <i>r</i>-strategists, they
tend to have some kind of social organization. Besides the care they give
their young, adults may share food, cooperate in the hunt, and fight predators
together. The <i>K</i>-symbol stands for the carrying capacity of the breeding
area, and represents the production of small numbers of offspring that
are carefully nurtured for a particular environment.
<p>All humans follow an extreme <i>K</i>-strategy. They have few young,
who take years to mature and require a great deal of care. They have large
brains and complex societies based on cooperation. However, human races
are not identical. The chart on page 3 shows that Asians consistently show
more <i>K</i> behavior than whites, who in turn show more than blacks.
There is virtually no departure from this pattern.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Maturation and Reproduction</font></b>
<p>In almost every respect, racial differences in the physiology of reproduction
show an <i>r-K</i> pattern that runs from blacks to whites to Asians. Fraternal
twinning, for example, which happens when a mother releases more than one
egg during ovulation, is clearly an <i>r</i>-strategy of producing more
and smaller young, who are more likely to be miscarried, be born underweight,
die in infancy, and receive less parental care.&nbsp;
<p>Fraternal twinning is twice as common among blacks as among whites,
and twice as common among whites as among Asians. Triplets are ten times
more common among whites than among Asians and 17 times more common among
Africans than among whites. In some African populations, multiple births
account for 60 out of every 1000. In Japan, where twins are very rare,
they are viewed suspiciously as the products of a &#8220;litter,&#8221; more akin to
dogs than to humans.
<p>Offspring of the different races gestate and mature according to different
<i>r-K</i>
strategies. Blacks are born earlier and smaller than whites, but are stronger
and better coordinated. They can sit up and roll over sooner than whites,
who can do so sooner than Asians. On average, blacks walk at age 11 months,
whites at 12 months, and Asians at 13 months.
<p>Although it is a specialized measure of development, permanent tooth
eruption occurs sooner in Africans than in Europeans, and later in Asians.
Among primates in general, there is near-perfect correlation between lateness
of permanent tooth eruption and such things as length of life, brain size,
years to maturity, and complexity of social organization.
<p>Blacks reach sexual maturity sooner than whites, who reach it sooner
than Asians. By age twelve, 19 percent of American black girls have fully
developed breasts and pubic hair whereas only five percent of white girls
do. Blacks, on average, have an earlier first menstruation than whites,
and Asians menstruate later than whites. In the United States, the average
white woman is two full years older than the average black woman when she
first has sexual intercourse, and Asians start having intercourse even
later than whites.
<p>Professor Rushton has bravely taken on the delicate subject of genital
size, which has received reluctant but official attention because of AIDS.
International organizations that try to provide condoms to people all over
the world have discovered that one size does not fit all. Blacks have larger
penises than whites, who have larger penises than Asians. The length of
the vagina also differs proportionately in each race. Black men produce
more sperm than do whites, and Asian men produce the least.
<p>In the United States, black married couples report the greatest frequency
of sexual intercourse, and Asian married couples report the lowest frequency.
AIDS, like other sexually transmitted disease, is most common among blacks,
rarest among Asians.
<p>In Africa, compared to Europe or Asia, it is common to have sexual relations
with many partners and to expend less effort on child-rearing. Older brothers
and sisters often look after smaller children. There are also huge racial
and regional differences in the number of offspring produced. In the United
States, the average woman produces 14 children, grand children and great-grand
children; in Africa the figure is 258. This prodigious African reproductive
effort takes place over a shorter life-span. Blacks do not live as long
as whites who, in turn, do not live as long as Asians.
<p>Here, clearly, are patterns of maturational and reproductive behavior
that show a consistent <i>r-K</i> pattern. Quick maturity, early reproduction,
numerous offspring, and shorter lives put blacks closer to the oyster end
of the scale than whites, who are closer to it than Asians.
<p>Differences in sexual activity, life-span, and number of children are
usually attributed to &#8220;culture&#8221; or &#8220;environment,&#8221; but there is every reason
to believe that they are at least partly genetic, just as size of sex organs
or age of sexual maturity are almost entirely genetic. Life-span, for example,
is clearly hereditary in part. The age at which an adopted child will die
is more easily predicted from the life-spans of the biological parents
than from those of the adoptive parents. Likewise, identical twins die,
on average, only 37 months apart whereas fraternal twins die 78 months
apart.
<p>What about the other components of the human <i>K</i>-strategy, such
as altruism, law-abidingness, and the other characteristics that make up
distinctly human social organizations? To what extent are what we think
of as personality – and the cultural institutions that reflect a population&rsquo;s
group personality – the products of heredity, and thus properly included
in an analysis of <i>r-K</i> strategy? Prof. Rushton has exhaustively surveyed
recent studies of heredity, which suggest a powerful genetic influence
on virtually all aspects of human behavior.

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Genes vs. Environment</font></b>
<p>Some of the most startling and convincing data on the relative influences
of genes vs. environment come from studies of identical twins who were
separated at birth and reared apart. Identical twins come from a single
egg that splits in two; the twins are genetically identical. Fraternal
twins are produced by a double ovulation and are no more genetically alike
than ordinary siblings. (Unlike fraternal twinning rates, there are no
racial differences in the frequencies of identical twinning.)&nbsp;

The crucial finding is that identical twins reared apart are more like
each other in virtually every way than are fraternal twins who were reared
in the same household. From these similarities it is possible to estimate
how much of the variation in personality traits is caused by genes and
how much by environment.&nbsp;
<p>The chart at the bottom of this page shows twin-study estimates of the
genetic contribution to various attitudes. These estimates almost certainly
undervalue heritability because the method used to calculate it assumes
that all aspects of environment are arbitrary. In fact, to a very large
degree, people influence their own environments according to traits that
are at least partly genetic. Thus, <i>even within the same family</i>,
an aggressive child elicits different responses from parents and playmates
– and thus has a different environment – from a child who is placid and
cooperative. Once they are independent of their parents, young people follow
their genetic propensities even more freely by choosing entirely different
environments.
<p>The methodology of heritability estimates ignores this. Thus, much of
the influence on personality traits that is due to &#8220;environment&#8221; undoubtedly
reflects personal surroundings that differ primarily because people shape
their surroundings to match their genetic predilections.
<p>Intelligence, which is one of the most important, stable and most frequently
measured traits, is also one of the most heritable. Variations in intelligence
within a population appear to be 60 to 80 percent governed by heredity.
<p>It is important to note that heritability estimates are for <i>variations</i>
in IQ, not total IQ. Thus, for two brothers with IQs of 100 and 120, a
genetic component of 60 percent (and an environmental component of 40 percent)
does not imply that 40 IQ points of the 100-IQ brother&rsquo;s intelligence are
theoretically attributable to environment. It means only that 40 percent
of the 20-point <i>difference</i> between the brothers – 8 IQ points –
is theoretically governed by non-genetic factors.&nbsp;
<p>Furthermore, no one is really sure how environment influences the remaining
40 to 20 percent that is presumably non-genetic. Non-genetic factors may
well be grossly biological events like malnutrition, childhood diseases,
and mishaps in the womb, rather than the household or educational differences
that most people think of as environment. Such things as Head Start or
special education appear to have very little lasting effect on IQ differences
either between individuals or races.

For the different racial groups, Prof. Rushton has aggregated the results
of a great many IQ studies to arrive at the following averages:
<p>Whites - 100, Asians - 105, American blacks (who are about 25 percent
white) - 85, African blacks - 70 to 75, Amerindians (including Central
and Latin Americans with little or no European blood) - 89, Polynesians,
Micronesians, Melanesians, and Maoris - 80 to 95.
<p>Although Asians have a higher general intelligence than whites, the
difference is mainly in visuo-spatial performance rather than verbal ability.
This makes Asians good engineers and mathematicians, but they do not have
a pronounced advantage in careers like law or language teaching. Not surprisingly,
a 1980s survey of professions in the United States found that Chinese-Americans
were over-represented in the sciences at a rate six times their proportion
in the population. However, there were only one fourth as many Chinese-American
lawyers as their numbers would suggest. Blacks were minimally represented
in both fields.
<p>Although it is common to criticize IQ tests precisely because they give
disparate results by race, there are other, more obviously biological indicators
of intelligence that cannot be accused of &#8220;cultural bias.&#8221; One that Prof.
Rushton himself has studied in depth is brain size.
<p>Larger heads (containing larger brains) are positively correlated with
intelligence. This is true within families, with the sibling with the largest
head likely to be the most intelligent. It is also true within races, with
large-brained blacks or Asians likely to be more intelligent than their
small-brained co-racialists.
<p>As groups, whites and Asians have larger brains than blacks. At age
seven, for example, black children are 16 percentile points taller than
white children, but their head perimeter is eight percentile points smaller.
Asians are likely to have larger brains than whites, though some indications
of larger size appear only after correcting upward for the fact that Asians
are smaller than whites. A small person with the same sized brain as a
big person can be thought of as having a &#8220;larger&#8221; brain, because smaller
bodies require less brain to maintain basal functions.
<p>Whites probably have about 100 million fewer cerebral neurons, on average,
than Asians and blacks have about 480 million fewer than whites. The black/Asian
difference is especially significant because of differences in body size.
Blacks with small brains in large bodies are at a serious intellectual
disadvantage compared to Asians because a larger proportion of their already-smaller
brains is probably occupied with basal functions and not available for
conscious thought.
<p>Yet another directly physiological assessment of intelligence is the
type of reaction-time test pioneered by Prof. Arthur Jensen of Berkeley.
These tests require people to make simple choices when a light goes on.
Intelligence is correlated with both speed and consistency of reaction
time, and Asians perform better than whites, who perform better than blacks.
<p>Prof. Rushton cites several additional reasons to suspect that racial
differences in intelligence are due to genetics rather than environment.
One is something called regression towards the mean. Individuals who are
at extreme points in a normal distribution of any trait are likely to have
children not so extreme as themselves. Very tall people, for example, are
likely to have taller-than-average children, but their children&rsquo;s heights
tend towards the average for the population. With respect to IQ, studies
have repeatedly shown that black Americans regress towards a mean of 85
while whites regress towards a mean of 100.
<p>Inbreeding depression scores are another persuasive indicator that racial
differences are genetic. Children that result from unions of very close
relatives often have unusually low scores on certain kinds of intelligence
tests, indicating that the abilities measured by those tests are highly
susceptible to genetic influence. As it happens, these measures of intelligence
are the very ones that show the <i>greatest</i> black-white differences,
which suggests that the intelligence gap is also genetic.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Other Personality Differences</font></b>
<p>High intelligence is not the only hallmark of <i>K</i>-strategy. Professor
Rushton explains that the races with more <i>K</i> traits have more complex
and cooperative social organizations, are more restrained and law abiding,
and show more altruism. In terms of <i>r-K</i> strategy, altruism and social
cooperation permit individuals to rear their young under more dependable
and peaceful circumstances – which is a precondition for groups that have
staked their survival on producing small numbers of large-brained but slow-maturing
offspring.
<p>For traits like altruism and aggression to be properly included in an
<i>r-K</i>
pattern, they must be shown to be, like intelligence, at least partly controlled
by heredity and to differ from race to race. Research suggests that these
traits are greatly influenced by heredity, and that they appear early in
life. In one study, children who were rated as &#8220;aggressive&#8221; by their peers
at age eight were rated the same way by a different set of peers 10 years
later. By the time they were 19 years old, those in the &#8220;aggressive&#8221; group
were three times more likely to have a police record than those who were
not considered &#8220;aggressive.&#8221;&nbsp;
<p>Identical twins are about twice as much alike in terms of altruism and
aggression as fraternal twins. Studies in both Europe and Japan have confirmed
that when a twin has been convicted of a crime, an <i>identical</i> co-twin
is two to three times more likely also to have been convicted than is a
<i>fraternal</i>
co-twin.&nbsp;
<p><img src="/news/2005/03/bee.gif" height="115" width="150" align="LEFT">Shyness and sociability
also appear very early in children and endure through adulthood. Studies
of identical twins reared apart have shown astonishing similarities not
only in personality, but in careers, frequencies of marriage, style of
dress, and individual mannerisms [please see <i>AR</i> cover story of August,
1993, for a broader discussion of twin studies].&nbsp;
<p>Research also shows that predictions about criminal behavior in adopted
children can be made more accurately from the behavior of biological parents
rather than adoptive parents. Some time between the ages of 21 and 30,
the adult personality is &#8220;set like plaster,&#8221; and environment seems to have
little effect on it.
<p><img src="/news/2005/03/monkey.gif" height="146" width="190" align="RIGHT">Prof. Rushton
points out that most people marry and make friends with people who are
genetically like themselves. They seek others who not only look but think
like they do. Durability of marriage has been shown to be linked to genetic
similarity of the partners – in intelligence, appearance, and in other
personality traits that are to some extent under genetic control.
<p>It is therefore not surprising that biological siblings have more similar
friends than do adopted siblings. Likewise, young criminals – who appear
to have a genetic propensity for crime – commonly make friends with other
young people with the same propensity.&nbsp;
<p>This clearly demonstrated human preference for associating with others
who are similar has important implications for race relations. Even very
young children are conscious of race and show racial preferences. Prof.
Rushton writes that ethnocentrism and &#8220;racism&#8221; are probably natural mechanisms
built into the human genotype.
<p>Expressions of altruism also have important implications for race relations.
In virtually all species, the closer two individuals are, genetically,
the more likely they are to help each other. This makes evolutionary sense
if genes are thought of as the basic units of evolution. Genes for altruism
are likely to leave more copies of themselves in future generations if
they produce a trait that causes individuals to help their close kin survive.
<p>Ants and bees are especially altruistic – frequently dying in great
numbers to protect the colony – because they have an unusual reproductive
pattern that causes workers to share 75 percent of their genes. Squirrels
and monkeys can detect genetic distance between themselves and others,
and are more cooperative towards close relatives.&nbsp;
<p>Male Rhesus monkeys are promiscuous and cannot be sure that the child
of a mate is their own. However, they have some unknown way of recognizing
their offspring, and are kinder to them than they are to unrelated youngsters.
(Actual kinship has been confirmed through blood tests.)
<p>Belding&rsquo;s ground squirrels mate with multiple partners, and females
have litters that contain both sisters and half sisters. Despite the fact
that they share the same womb and the same nest, full sisters fight less
often and help each other more often than half sisters.
<p>Among humans, preschool children are 40 times more likely to be assaulted
by a step parent – that is to say, a genetic stranger – than by a biological
parent. In promiscuous societies in which fathers are not sure which children
are their own, they put more effort into caring for their sisters&rsquo; children
than for those of their wives. A sister&rsquo;s child is always close kin, whereas
a promiscuous wife&rsquo;s child may not be kin at all.
<p>Experiments in altruism confirm the obvious: People are more willing
to help people like themselves. Similar appearance is a good indicator
of genetic similarity, and Prof. Rushton observes that racial solidarity
can be viewed as a kind of extended nepotism. He also argues that it is
often fruitless to look for sociological or economic reasons for the racial
conflicts found all around the world. Genetic similarity and the desire
to preserve a common set of genes are more likely explanations.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Racial Differences</font></b>
<p>The races differ consistently in the personality traits that can be
classified according to <i>r-K</i> theory, just as they do in intelligence.
Asians are more restrained, cooperative, and less aggressive than whites;
whites are more restrained and less aggressive than blacks. These rankings
are the same, whether subjects are assessed by personality tests or by
their peers. From an early age, blacks are more impulsive and dominant
than whites, and males boast and swagger more. Asians are least dominant
and impulsive.
<p>Differences in crime rates by race are too well established to bear
repeating [please see <i>AR</i> cover story of June, 1994]. These differences
are consistent across multi- and mono-racial societies. Nevertheless, stiff
resistance to genetic explanations leads to environmental theories that
are unintentionally funny. As Prof. Rushton notes, earlier in this century,
all forms of deviance were so low in American Chinatowns – despite their
poverty – that the ghetto was thought to <i>protect</i> people from crime.
For blacks, isolation is routinely said to <i>cause</i> crime.
<p>Although trendy talk of &#8220;self-esteem&#8221; suggests otherwise, blacks have
higher opinions of themselves than whites, who have higher opinions of
themselves than Asians. Asians are the most introverted and anxious; blacks
are the least. Suicide figures reflect this: Whites kill themselves twice
as frequently as blacks, and Asians kill themselves more often than whites.
Self-consciousness and introspection seem to rise along with <i>K</i> characteristics.
<p>Rates of mental instability show the opposite trend. Two hundred and
forty out of every 100,000 blacks are in mental institutions whereas only
162 of every 100,000 whites are. Nor is this a function of poverty or wealth;
blacks suffer from mental disorders, drug addiction, and alcoholism at
higher rates than whites in all social classes. Asians, despite their introversion
and anxiety, have the fewest mental problems.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Differences Within Races</font></b>
<p>Prof. Rushton points out that <i>r-K</i> theory can account for differences
between individuals <i>of the same race</i>. That is to say, people of
the same race tend to vary according to the same pattern that distinguishes
the races. In both Europe and Africa, the following traits tend to go together:
large families, short life-span, criminality, high levels of sexuality,
loose family ties, frequency of twinning.
<p>Mothers of fraternal twins are more likely than other mothers to have
had early first periods, larger families, lower birth-weight children (even
when they are singletons), more infant mortality, to have been promiscuous,
and to have shorter lives. Prof. Rushton has found that in all societies,
fraternal twins are more likely to be born into the lower than the upper
classes.&nbsp;
<p>A Swedish study determined that girls who have early first periods are
more likely to cheat, be truant, and try marijuana than girls who have
late first periods. In the United States, early maturation is correlated
with promiscuity, illegitimate births, leaving school, crime, and other
social problems. Early sexual maturity seems to be heritable, with daughters
resembling their mothers.
<p>If altruism is an important <i>K</i> trait, crime would be an extreme
<i>r</i>
trait. Across broad populations, crime is associated with behavior that
almost perfectly describes how blacks differ from whites and whites differ
from Asians: large families, illegitimacy, low intelligence, early sexual
maturity, promiscuity, weak family ties, little investment in children,
and a short life.
<p>Prof. Rushton suggests that the entire complex of <i>r-K</i> trait differences
is therefore largely under genetic control, and that it characterizes different
social classes just as it does races. There is little question that the
most physiological <i>r-K</i> traits are heavily influenced by heredity.
Prof. Rushton makes the additional point that physiology is closely correlated
with many other forms of behavior previously thought to be independent
of heredity but now found to be greatly influenced by it. The result is
a strong case for believing that the patterns of behavior that distinguish
races as well as individuals are largely inherent, reflect a consistent
<i>r-K</i>
pattern, and are impervious to social &#8220;programs.&#8221;

Prof. Rushton takes the argument one provocative step further. In the current
era of social mobility, in which most hereditary social privileges have
disappeared, people succeed or fail in life very much according to their
native abilities. The children of the rich are usually smart and talented
because they inherit the qualities that made their parents rich.
<p>However, as Prof. Rushton points out, a child&rsquo;s IQ is a better predictor
of his adult social status than is the social status of his parents. And,
when the unintelligent children of the rich start descending the social
scale, they take on the habits and values of their new class rather than
keep the ones of the class into which they were born. Even the most <i>K</i>-oriented
parents can have an<i> r</i> child, whose life increasingly reflects his
genetic inclinations.
<p>Prof. Rushton&rsquo;s findings are a serious blow to contemporary egalitarian
dogma. Unfortunately, the usual reaction to his work is simply to make
wild accusations about his motives. In an article called &#8220;Professors of
Hate,&#8221; the October 20th issue of <i>Rolling Stone</i> claims to have unmasked
him as a vicious racist.
<p>Of course, it is the haters of science and free inquiry who build societies
that cannot but degenerate as ours has. Anyone who wants to understand
the world as it, and to base policy on facts rather than on fantasies,
cannot ignore this very important book.
