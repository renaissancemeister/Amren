<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p><i><p>To see the video and a documentary on diversity training at an elementary school, click on the title of this article, then on the link under &#8220;WE <span class="caps">ARE FAMILY</span>: A <span class="caps">MUSICAL MESSAGE FOR ALL</span>&#8221; on the right hand side of the page.</p><br>
</i></p>
<p><p>The much-anticipated children&rsquo;s music video of the smash hit &#8220;We Are Family,&#8221; which features over 100 beloved children&rsquo;s characters including Arthur, Barney, Bear, Big Bird, Clifford, JoJo and SpongeBob, is being distributed nationwide this week to over 15,000 public school districts (reaching over 60,000 public elementary schools) as well as <span class="caps">NAIS </span>accredited private elementary schools. The video and accompanying teacher&rsquo;s guide demonstrate the importance of togetherness embodied in the word &#8220;family.&#8221; To celebrate the launch of this initiative, the video debuted today at Public School 87 on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and was met with extreme enthusiasm by students and educators who embraced the video and its message. In addition, local launch events will take place at elementary schools throughout the country this week. </p></p>
<div class="text-center"><img src="/news/2005/03/wearefamily.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><p>The We Are Family Foundation together with its partners the Anti-Defamation League, Crown Theatres, <span class="caps">DIC</span> Entertainment, Disney Channel, FedEx, <span class="caps">HIT</span> Entertainment, LazyTown Entertainment, Muppets Holding Company, Nickelodeon, Nile Rodgers/Sony Publishing, The Bernard Edwards Company, <span class="caps">LLC,</span> Nelvana, Scholastic, Sesame Workshop, Spellbound Entertainment, Toni Mendez Shapiro Estate, and <span class="caps">WGBH </span>have come together to produce and distribute this unprecedented children&rsquo;s educational music video and teacher&rsquo;s guide. The characters appearing in the video are from award-winning shows including <em>Arthur, Barney, Bear in the Big Blue House, Between the Lions, Blue&rsquo;s Clues, Bob the Builder, The Book of Pooh, Clifford the Big Red Dog, Dora the Explorer, Jimmy Neutron, JoJo&rsquo;s Circus, Kim Possible, Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series, Madeline, The Magic School Bus, The Muppet Show, The Proud Family, Rugrats, Sesame Street, SpongeBob SquarePants, </em>and <em>Zoom, </em>among others. The video, which also features cameo appearances by Bill Cosby, Diana Ross and Whoopi Goldberg, will air on Disney Channel and Nickelodeon on March 11, 2005 as a Public Service Announcement. In addition, the video will air sporadically on various local <span class="caps">PBS </span>stations throughout the months of March and April 2005. A <span class="caps">PSA </span>is also airing in Crown Theatres across the nation this month. </p></p>
<p><p>The <span class="caps">DVD </span>package includes the &#8220;We Are Family&#8221; music video with a special introduction from <em>Between the Lions </em>, a version without the introduction, a sing-along version, a special message from the video creators and a <span class="caps">PSA.</span> The <span class="caps">DVD </span>may be used alone to bring classes or school communities together, as a supplement to current family/diversity programs in schools, or as a complete educational tool utilizing the teacher&rsquo;s guide provided with the <span class="caps">DVD. </span></p></p>
<p><p>The accompanying teacher&rsquo;s guide, developed by the award-winning Anti-Defamation League&rsquo;s A <span class="caps">WORLD</span> OF <span class="caps">DIFFERENCE</span>&reg; Institute and its Miller Early Childhood Program, includes easy-to-do lessons and activities that will help children understand the idea of global community, and to recognize that the celebration of diversity is a positive, enriching, and unifying force in our world. The teaching guide is available for download from both the Anti-Defamation League (www.adl.org) and We Are Family Foundation (www.wearefamilyfoundation.org) web sites. </p></p>
<p><p>The <span class="caps">DVD </span>and teacher&rsquo;s guide are designed for use in preschool and primary grade classrooms as a supplement to instruction in literacy, math and other subjects, as well as in after-school programs that emphasize citizenship, character, diversity, and other family values. We live in a global age where learning the essential values of understanding and respect for other cultures is important. The <span class="caps">DVD </span>and teacher&rsquo;s guide introduce these values to children through a unique mix of motivational music and educational tools. </p></p>
<p><p>&#8220;This is an unprecedented event: for the first time characters from all of the important kids&rsquo; shows came together to appear in the same video,&#8221; stated Christopher Cerf, award-winning children&rsquo;s TV/music producer, who spearheaded production along with Mitchell Kriegman, president of Shadow Projects. &#8220;The producers and performers from each show embraced the spirit and message of this project. They were thrilled to allow their characters to appear with other characters from different shows simply because they understood the importance and meaning behind &#8216;We Are Family.&rsquo;&#8221; </p></p>
<p><p>&#8220;Cooperation and unity are the most important values we can teach children. We believe that this is the essential first step to loving thy neighbor,&#8221; says Nile Rodgers, co-writer of the song &#8220;We Are Family&#8221; and founder of the We Are Family Foundation. &#8220;And the fun and exciting format makes it a lesson that&rsquo;s easy for children to learn.&#8221; </p></p>
<p><p>FedEx has generously agreed to ship the packages to school districts the week of March 7 th for free. &#8220;FedEx is proud to provide in-kind shipping for the We Are Family project. Promoting diversity is part of our corporate culture at FedEx. As a multinational corporation, diversity is not just a people issue, it&rsquo;s a business issue. We value the diversity of our employees, customers and suppliers. Helping to deliver the We Are Family Foundation messages of respect, understanding and appreciation of differences to our nation&rsquo;s schoolchildren is a natural extension of how we do business,&#8221; states William G. Margaritis, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Corporate Communications. </p></p>
<p><p>Production of this major initiative has been funded by a grant from the Toni Mendez Shapiro Estate. &#8220;We Are Family&#8221; is used courtesy of Nile Rodgers / Sony Publishing and The Bernard Edwards Company, <span class="caps">LLC. </span></p></p>
