<h1>Kenyan Rapist Jailed for 66 Years in US</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gitau wa Njenga, Standard (Nairobi), Mar. 26</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A HIV-positive Kenyan man has been jailed for 66 years by a US court for raping two teenage girls two years ago.</p>
<p>William N. Karanja, 34, received 40 years for two counts of second-degree rape, 20 for two counts of second-degree sex offence and six for two counts of knowingly attempting to transmit HIV.</p>
<p>Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge, Louise G. Scrivener, also gave Karanja 15 years for three counts of recklessly endangering a minor, to be served concurrently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe from the evidence that Karanja is a sexual predator,&rdquo; Scrivener said.</p>
<p>And as Karanja began his long stretch in a US Federal jail, it emerged yesterday that he had a history of sexual offences dating back to his youth.</p>
<p>A close relative who spoke to The Standard in London said: &ldquo;Karanja has previously raped women in Kenya, but his victims were too scared to come forward.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My family is devastated, 66 years in a foreign jail, ailing with HIV-Aids, it&rsquo;s most regrettable, our heart goes to his wife and the victims,&rdquo; the cousin, who did not wish to be named, said.</p>
<p>According to The Gazette, a Montgomery County newspaper, the incident happened in June 2003 when Karanja invited the then-14-year-old girls to a &lsquo;party&rsquo; in his apartment on 13200 block of Bristlecone Way, Germantown in Montgomery County.</p>
<p>When the girls arrived that night, they realised they were the only guests and called another male friend to join them, Assistant State Attorney, Mary Herdman, said.</p>
<p>Karanja supplied the girls and their friend with alcohol, and all three juveniles ultimately passed out in various locations in the apartment.</p>
<p>At about 1 am, a neighbour said he heard a girl screaming &ldquo;No&rdquo; from inside Karanja&rsquo;s apartment. He looked in through a window and saw Karanja having sex with one of the girls while she attempted to push him away, Herdman said.</p>
<p>When police arrived, they found all three children partially or completely naked and unresponsive to the officers&rsquo; attempts to wake them up.</p>
<p>Both victims, now 16, made emotional appeals to the court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stole from me in order to get pleasure for himself,&rdquo; one said. &ldquo;I was violated, taken advantage of and humiliated&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The other said tearfully: &ldquo;I think there should be no sympathy for him &hellip; &rdquo;</p>
<p>Assistant State Attorney Sherri D. Koch described Karanja as a &lsquo;callous&rsquo; man who not only raped two minors but also knowingly exposed them to HIV.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has absolutely no regard for human life,&rdquo; Koch said. &ldquo;He could have potentially given them the death sentence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls have been tested for the virus, and so far, the results have been negative, she said.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s attorneys also argued that Karanja lied to his now-estranged wife about his HIV-status and knowingly infected her, as well.</p>
<p>But the defence lawyers, Vicky Tyler and Melanie Creedon, maintained Karanja did not know he had HIV until his wife was tested during her pregnancy.</p>
<p>They plan to appeal the sentence.</p>
<p>Karanja will be eligible for parole after 33 years. He had been held without bond at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility in Clarksburg since his arrest in June 22, 2003.</p>
<p>After serving his sentence, Karanja &mdash; who was in the United States on a visa &mdash; will be deported to Kenya, Judge Scrivener said.</p>
<p>Karanja is the first Kenyan to be sentenced to a hefty jail term exceeding three decades in a foreign prison.</p>
<p>Six years ago, another Kenyan, Rashid Musa, 28, was jailed for life by a UK court for raping a teenage boy in a train toilet and an office cleaner at knifepoint in London.</p>
<p>In November 2003, another Kenyan, Mohammed Dica, 40, was jailed for eight years at Inner London Crown Court for infecting two women with the HIV virus.</p>
<p>He was the first person in UK to be convicted with what became known as &lsquo;Biological Grievous Bodily Harm (B-GBH).</p>
