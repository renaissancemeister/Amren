<h1><a href="https://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/printer-friendly.asp?ARTICLE_ID=44168">Nickelodeon Tells Kids: Alamo Fought for Slavery</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WorldNetDaily.com, May 8</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Most Americans believe the 189 Texans who died at the Alamo in 1836 were fighting for independence and liberty, but Nickelodeon, the award winning television network for children, is telling kids that Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie and all the rest were actually fighting to defend slavery. </p>
<p>In a short &#147;Nick News Bump,&#148; currently being broadcast, the kids network features the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, site of the battle between a small group of Texans and a large Mexican army under Gen. Santa Ana, &#147;the Napoleon of the West,&#148; as he described himself. The Texans, who had taken refuge in the mission known as the Alamo, were killed in fighting that followed a 13-day seige, and their bodies were burned. Mexican losses are estimated to have been around 1,600. </p>
<p>The heroic resistance and loss of life made the Alamo the &#147;cradle of Texas liberty&#148; to most Americans, but that&rsquo;s not the story Nickelodeon tells. </p>
<p>A teenage Hispanic girl provides the voice over as she walks in front of the Alamo: </p>
<blockquote>My name is Salviola. I&rsquo;m from San Antonio, Texas, and the Alamo is in my backyard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In 1718, the mission of San Antonio de la Valero was established. The church structure is still standing today and it is known as the Alamo.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The battle for the Alamo is often remembered as a rebellion of a small group of brave Texas farmers fighting against the Mexican army. What you may not know is that at the time, Texas was part of Mexico.</blockquote>
<blockquote>By the early 1800s, a lot of people living in San Antonio were farmers who brought their slaves with them. In 1829, Mexico abolished slavery and what followed was years of conflict between farmers who wanted to keep their slaves and Mexican authorities. This conflict led up to the battle for the Alamo.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the end, Gen. Santa Ana and 5,000 Mexican soldiers surrounded the Alamo and all the defenders of the mission were killed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, when you remember the Alamo, think about the soldiers, the battle and the true story behind it.</blockquote>
<p>Nickelodeon is not the first to revise the history of the Alamo. </p>
<p>Last year, Disney released &#147;The Alamo&#148; at a cost of $100 million&mdash;a film criticized for its political correctness, as WorldNetDaily <a href="https://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=37909">reported</a>. </p>
<p>&#147;The movie reads more like a Disney fairy tale and promotes a politically correct revisionist agenda aimed at destroying a traditional American hero,&#148; said B. Forrest Clayton of Freedom Alliance, who reviewed the script. </p>
<p>Despite several historical witnesses who told of Davy Crockett being killed fighting, in the thick of combat during the battle, Clayton noted that Disney portrayed Crockett as a &#147;frightened wanderer&#148; who wanted to escape &#147;over the wall&#148; in the dark of night during the historic struggle. </p>
<p>Disney also portrayed Gen. Sam Houston as a &#147;venereal-diseased drunkard&#148; and Col. William Barret Travis, commander of Texan forces at the Alamo, as a &#147;deadbeat dad and serial adulterer.&#148; </p>
<p>In addition, charged the Feedom Alliance, Col. James Bowie, the Alamo defender famous for his knife-fighting skills, was portrayed as a land-swindling slave trader. </p>
