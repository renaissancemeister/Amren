<p>In November, a tiny company called NitroMed unveiled results showing that its drug combo, BiDil, reduced deaths due to heart failure by half. </p>
<p>The results were astounding, but there was a catch. The drug was only tested on African-Americans and had previously failed to show a benefit in a broader population. An editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine by M. Gregg Bloche, a Georgetown University medical ethicist, warned of the need to manage the downside of &ldquo;race-based therapeutics&rdquo; &mdash; and predicted that it was only a matter of time before race was linked to the effects of other drugs. </p>
<p>Only six months later, Bloche seems prescient. A flood of studies has emerged showing racial differences in how patients suffer from disease &mdash; or benefit from drugs &mdash; in ailments ranging from osteoporosis to cancer. And several more have looked at the effects of drugs on particular racial groups. Many of the doctors conducting the studies are African-American. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But issues emerged from cases where racial groups are compared, and differences are found. The labeling for AstraZeneca&rsquo;s cholesterol drug Crestor suggests starting the drug at a lower dose in Asians. Another AstraZeneca drug, the lung cancer pill Iressa, failed to extend life in a clinical trial but seems to have worked in Asians. </p>
<p>Perhaps the best-studied example is African-Americans with heart disease. Just as BiDil may have been more effective in African-Americans than others, a widely-used class of heart medicines does not work as well in black patients. </p>
<p>Medicines called ACE inhibitors are cornerstones of cardiology. But for reasons that are still unclear, they seem not to work as well in African-Americans. This outcome was confirmed in a recent analysis of a government-funded 33,000-patient study of blood pressure medicines. For all patients, old-fashioned diuretics, or water pills, are the preferred first treatment. But blacks do less well with ACE inhibitors. </p>

<p><em>Medical News Today, May 11</em></p>
<p>African-American and Caucasian adolescent girls handle sodium and calcium differently, which may help explain why the races have different rates of hypertension and osteoporosis, according to research at Purdue University. </p>
<p>In a study published in the April edition of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, nutrition researchers discovered Caucasian girls lose more calcium in their urine than African-American girls, but both races lose calcium at an accelerated rate when they consume a high-salt diet. </p>
<p>&ldquo;While we found a racial difference in calcium retention in adolescents, we also confirmed that blacks retain more sodium on a high-salt diet than whites,&rdquo; said Connie Weaver, distinguished professor and head of Purdue&rsquo;s Department of Foods and Nutrition. &ldquo;This proves that salt is processed differently in the races, but too much salt in the diet reduces bone density in both races.&rdquo; </p>
<p>One out of four Caucasians will be diagnosed with osteoporosis, a bone-loss disease that costs Americans $14 billion a year in health care. The disease strikes one out of 10 African-Americans, but studies show they are more susceptible to hypertension, Weaver said. </p>
