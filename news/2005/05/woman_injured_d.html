<h1>Woman Injured During Protest At Monument</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christina L. Esparza, San Gabriel Valley Tribune (Los Angeles), May 16</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><span class="caps">BALDWIN PARK</span> &mdash; A 66-year-old woman hurt during a protest at the Metrolink station over the weekend is recovering at home as police search for the person responsible for her injuries, officials said Monday. </p>
<p>The unidentified woman was released from Citrus Valley Medical Center Queen of the Valley Campus on Sunday, officials said. </p>
<p>She was hit in the head with a water bottle as she stood Saturday at the station with members of Save Our State, a group protesting the Danza Indigenas monument they say is un &mdash; American, racist and seditious. </p>
<p>A doctor at the hospital said she suffered an &ldquo;inner cranial trauma,&rdquo; police officials said. </p>
<p>Baldwin Park police Sgt. David Reynoso said police have a videotape of the incident and are still reviewing it to see if the culprit can be found. </p>
<p>Investigators also are looking to the public for answers. Anyone who saw the person who threw the bottle could come forward and remain anonymous if they wish. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand people have the First Amendment right to assemble and free speech. We don&rsquo;t discourage that,&rdquo; Reynoso said. &ldquo;What we do discourage is acts of violence, such as throwing water bottles. We ask people to keep calm, respect everybody and obey the laws.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Baldwin Park Mayor Manuel Lozano said he blames Turner for the woman&rsquo;s injuries because he took senior citizens to an event that could have become dangerous. </p>
<p>He contends Turner is preying on senior citizens to market &ldquo;himself to make a big organization and spread his hatred throughout the region.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was literally outraged,&rdquo; Lozano said. &ldquo;He should be held accountable for using senior citizens in that capacity.&rdquo;</p>
