<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For 12 years, public artwork near the Baldwin Park Metrolink station never caused a stir. </p>
<p>But when a Ventura-based group that opposes illegal immigration got wind of what was inscribed on the artwork this month, they organized a protest that garnered attention when it was announced on the &ldquo;John &amp; Ken Show&rdquo; on <span class="caps">KFI</span>-AM (640). </p>
<p>By Saturday, activists on both sides of the immigration issue mobilized, resulting in a sometimes chaotic confrontation in the San Gabriel Valley community. </p>
<p>Members of Save Our State, a 7-month-old organization, say they are offended by &ldquo;anti-American&rdquo; inscriptions that read, &ldquo;It was better before they came&rdquo; and &ldquo;This land was Mexican once, was Indian always and is, and will be again&rdquo; on the 20-foot-high arch. </p>
<p><img src="/news/2005/05/monument.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;I find it incredibly offensive,&rdquo; said Joseph Turner, the group&rsquo;s executive director. The quotation &ldquo;is seditious in nature. It essentially talks about returning this land to Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of this nuance was absent at the rally, which quickly descended into a heated face-off for over two hours at Pacific and Downing avenues. Protesters on both sides hurled obscenities and taunts, and at times argued face-to-face before police arrived. </p>
<p>Opponents of Save Our State consisted mainly of young adults who said they sent e-mails to Latino and immigrant worker advocacy groups. Many were politically active teenagers and college students who skateboarded to the scene. </p>
<p>&ldquo;People from Ventura are coming to our town demanding we take down artwork? That&rsquo;s just ridiculous,&rdquo; said Joe Lozano, 23, a Baldwin Park resident.</p>
<p>By 1:20 p.m., police in riot helmets formed a line in front of the Save Our State group, whose 40 supporters seemed outnumbered 10-to-1 from all sides. Streets were closed off and an officer informed Turner at one point that they could not guarantee the safety of him and his supporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re calling reinforcements,&rdquo; said Turner, 28, who grinned at the counterprotesters with his arms folded.</p>
<p>Randy Selenak, 56, of Orange, was carrying the Stars and Stripes and wearing a T-shirt with red, white and blue that read, &ldquo;These Colors Will Not Run.&rdquo; The Save Our State supporter said that going to Baldwin Park &mdash; where 70% of its 80,000 residents are Latino &mdash; was &ldquo;like going into the lion&rsquo;s den. I just want to get out of here in one piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Police were called in from other departments, including Arcadia, Covina, El Monte, Glendora, Irwindale and West Covina, as were deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department.</p>
<p>An elderly woman standing on Save Our State&rsquo;s corner was allegedly hit by a thrown water bottle, and required medical attention at the scene. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>City Councilman David Olivas said members of Save Our State have &ldquo;created an atmosphere of hate&rdquo; and that he and other Baldwin Park officials have been inundated since their phone numbers and e-mail addresses were posted on the group&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The e-mails I&rsquo;ve received are bordering on hate crimes,&rdquo; said Olivas, who added that the messages would be sent to the district attorney&rsquo;s office. </p>
<p>Turner said that when people describe him as a racist, &ldquo;usually they are projecting their own racism.&rdquo; </p>

<div class="title">E-mail Alert from the International Action Center</div>
<p>End Immigrant Bashing! </p>
<p>Racists Out of Baldwin Park! </p>
<p>The International Action Center and its national Committee in Defense of Immigrant Workers is joining other organizations to organize a counter protest against a racist, anti-immigration demonstration being held Saturday, May 14 at the Metrolink Station in Baldwin Park from 12 noon to 2 <span class="caps">PM.</span></p>
<p>The racist group calling the demonstration is named Saveourstate.org. This group has ties to and openly supports the vigilante group, Minutemen, in <span class="caps">AZ.</span> On their website announcing the event Saveourstate.org exposes their racist nature by stating: &ldquo;Californians are tired of watching their communities turn into Third World cesspools as a result of a massive invasion of illegal aliens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The organizers plan to protest a community-inspired monument at the Metrolink Station that recognizes the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>theft of native and Mexican land. Referring to language on the monument characterized as divisive, the group demands that the city of Baldwin Park &ldquo;voluntarily remove these offensive passages by Friday, July 1st, in advance of the American Independence weekend.&rdquo; They then threaten, &ldquo;If this situation is not remedied, SaveOurState.org will take additional steps to ensure that the passages are removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is needed is a broad outpouring of progressive organizations and people to drown out calls for racist and anti-immigrant bigotry and terrorism.</p>
