<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4576663.stm">Trial Over Italian Islam &lsquo;Insult&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, May 24</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Controversial Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci is to face trial for allegedly insulting the Muslim faith in her latest book, a court in Italy says. </p>
<p>Ms Fallaci is being sued by the head of the Muslim Union of Italy, who says The Force of Reason is defamatory. </p>
<p>The journalist caused an uproar with The Rage and the Pride, published two weeks after the 11 September attacks. </p>
<p>In it, she said Western culture was superior to Islam and Muslim immigrants in the West had &ldquo;multiplied like rats&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Her lawyers have defended her right to express controversial opinions. </p>
<p>&ldquo;At the heart of her thinking is the following reasoning: the fight against Islamic terrorism is made more difficult by intellectual terrorism cloaked in anti-racism,&rdquo; Gilles Goldhagen, said in 2002, when a French judge was hearing a case to ban The Rage and the Pride. </p>
<p>&lsquo;No good Islam&rsquo; </p>
<p>The Force of Reason is said to have gone to print about 24 hours after the 11 March 2004 train bombings in Spain. </p>
<p>In it, Ms Fallaci argues that Europe is turning into &ldquo;an Islamic province, an Islamic colony&rdquo; and that &ldquo;to believe that a good Islam and a bad Islam exist goes against all reason&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Italian preliminary investigative judge Armando Grasso ordered the formulation of charges against the author, saying the book had expressions which were &ldquo;unequivocally offensive to Islam&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Adel Smith, president of the Muslim Union of Italy, sued the writer on 8 April 2004. He says Ms Fallaci has been advocating and spreading hate against Islam and Muslims, sometimes by allegedly distorting real historical facts and inventing others. </p>
<p>The case is being tried in the northern town of Bergamo, where the book was published. The prosecution has 10 days to come up with a charge. </p>
<p>Ms Fallaci, who lives in New York, was a Resistance fighter in World War II and a former war correspondent.</p>
