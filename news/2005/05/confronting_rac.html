<h1>Confronting Racism through Workshops</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Fernandez, News &amp; Record (Greensboro, NC), May 22</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Diversity and anti-racism training are not new to Guilford County Schools, but the philosophy of a group offering such training during this academic year has raised concerns. </p>
<p>About 300 teachers and community members have gone through anti-racism training with Chicago-based Crossroads Ministry since August. </p>
<p>Participants are taught that history is written from the perspective of whites and that laws and policies benefit whites while putting minorities at an immediate disadvantage. </p>
<p>The district paid Crossroads Ministry about $45,000 for training through mid-November, a district spokesman said. More current costs were not available. </p>
<p>Superintendent Terry Grier wants to spend $500,000 next year on teacher training, including anti-racism sessions from groups such as Crossroads. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The teachers, who are mostly white, said they felt defensive going into the workshop because they feel the assumption is they are racist and need the training. </p>
<p>They have been required to take this training, although typically the district allows each school to decide which training to offer or require of employees. </p>
<p>Parent Cheryl Smith wrote a letter to the News &amp; Record about her concerns with Crossroads, particularly descriptions of whites being racist attributed to the Rev. Joe Barndt, a co-founder of Crossroads. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have problems with other individuals calling me names and saying ugly things about me or millions of other people when they don&rsquo;t know me,&rdquo; said Smith, . </p>
<p>David Beito, an associate professor of history at the University of Alabama, protested the same training at the college five years ago after reading Barndt&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;Dismantling Racism.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He said Barndt looks at the &ldquo;bleak aspects of American society&rdquo; and not at &ldquo;all the progress we&rsquo;ve had in the past 50 years.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of emphasis on guilt,&rdquo; Beito said in a phone interview. &ldquo;This is fringe stuff, and they&rsquo;re trying to force it down people&rsquo;s throats.&rdquo; </p>
