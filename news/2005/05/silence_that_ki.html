<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This morning, I logged on to www.Boortz.com to check out Neal&rsquo;s daily reading assignments. The first thing that caught my eye was a story about Newspeak magazine-or, Newsweek, as they prefer to be called. It seems their story about the desecration of the Koran by US troops isn&rsquo;t exactly flushing out upon closer examination.</p>
<p>In light of this apparently monumental lapse of professional judgment, many are asking a very serious question: Did Newsweek, in its zeal to attack the Bush administration and the Iraq War, run a false story that has sparked violence, murder, and anti-American sentiment around the world?</p>
<p>In other words, do the people at Newsweek have blood on their hands?</p>
<p>I frequently ask myself a similar question about my colleagues in the so-called social sciences. In their reporting of the news (or &ldquo;research&rdquo;) in the social sciences, they frequently fail to run with stories, which might save a lot of lives. I often ask myself whether social science professors have blood on their hands as I think about some of the following taboo subjects:</p>
<p>Black on White Crime. A couple of years ago, a student of mine was beaten within an inch of his life while walking alone after midnight in downtown Durham, North Carolina. At first, the police thought he had been a victim of a hit-and-run incident that crushed several of his bones and punctured his lungs. He barely survived.</p>
<p>Later, the police (realizing it was a bat that hit him, not a car) concluded (based on an outbreak of similar cases in the area) that he had probably been attacked by a minority gang that required the maiming or killing of a white person for initiation. What if the student, a criminal justice major, had been told the truth about inter-racial crime? What if his professors taught him that blacks-though outnumbered six-to-one in the population by whites-actually attack whites many times more often than whites attack them?</p>
<p>Would white students be more likely to avoid minority neighborhoods while walking alone and late at night? More importantly, would this information save lives?</p>
