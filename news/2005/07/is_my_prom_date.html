<h1>Is My Prom Date Kosher?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gabrielle Birkner, Jewish Week (New York), June 16</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Morning announcements at the Solomon Schechter School of Westchester generally tread predictable terrain: schedule changes, meeting times, athletic events. But one item exasperated some teens last school year. </p>
<p>At several upcoming social events &mdash; a coffeehouse, the Junior Ball &mdash; upper-school students would not be permitted to bring non-Jewish dates, it was announced. </p>
<p>Upon hearing the policy, Karla Bertrand, a Schechter student whose father was Catholic when her parents married and whose boyfriend at the time was not Jewish, headed to the principal&rsquo;s office to beg the administration to reconsider the dictate. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Worse, she said, the decree might inadvertently prove racist. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people can pass as Jewish,&rdquo; said Bertrand, now 18, noting that school officials would be hard pressed to determine at the door who was Jewish. &ldquo;If the school was going to investigate students they suspected brought non-Jewish dates, the only red flag would be if someone was another race.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carol Pankin, whose two teenaged sons attend Gann Academy, a community school in Waltham, Mass., where prom policy emerged as a hot-button issue this year, opposes interfaith dating, but said parents &mdash; not schools &mdash; should be the ones making decisions about dating and proms. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If a 17-year-old is dating someone who isn&rsquo;t Jewish, I feel it&rsquo;s the parents&rsquo; responsibility,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They should be the ones saying, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want you to do this.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ultimately, Gann&rsquo;s board of directors issued a written prom policy that Rabbi Lehmann called &ldquo;a very strong statement about the board&rsquo;s commitment to Jewish continuity as part of the mission of the school and the future of the Jewish people.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The policy affirmed the school&rsquo;s goals to promote dating and marriage within the Jewish community, and asked students to &ldquo;consider these goals when inviting dates to proms and dances.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jeffrey Jablansky, another Schechter student, rejected the notion that the school&rsquo;s policy was &ldquo;segregationist&rdquo; or &ldquo;exclusionist&rdquo; in a newspaper editorial that ran opposite the Bertrand piece. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Face the facts or abdicate from them: We are the next generation of Jews and we cannot afford a diluted Judaism in times of mixed marriages and anti-Semitic sentiment all over the world,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;How will we, the next generation of Jewish adults, make decisions rooted in Jewish faith without the proper guidance during high school?&rdquo; </p>
<p>One Schechter mother, who supports the school&rsquo;s prom policy, said: &ldquo;We want to encourage building a Jewish life throughout the life of the student.&rdquo; </p>
