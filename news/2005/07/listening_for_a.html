						<p>Enoch 
              Powell was the greatest of British opponents to multi-racialism, 
              and anyone who speaks out against it stands in his shadow. He articulated 
              brilliantly and fearlessly the concerns of ordinary people ignored 
              by an arrogant liberal elite, and succeeded more than any other 
              man in calling attention to the destruction of Britain.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Powell&rsquo;s career prior to becoming 
              an MP is well known. Born in Birmingham in 1912, he was an outstanding 
              student at King Edward VI&rsquo;s High School in his home city, and 
              then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read classics. He became 
              a don at that college and then, at the age of only 25, professor 
              of Greek at the University of Sydney, Australia. Returning to Britain 
              and enlisting as a private soldier at the outbreak of war in 1939, 
              he rose rapidly to the rank of Brigadier General.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">After the war he turned his energies 
              to politics and was elected Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South-west 
              in February 1950. This was less than two years after 500 Jamaicans 
              arrived in Tilbury on board the <i>Empire Windrush</i>, but for 
              some years Powell stood aloof from the immigration debate.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Labour lost power to the Conservatives 
              in 1951, and the Conservatives remained in office until 1964. Always 
              a man who put beliefs before career, Powell&rsquo;s first major act 
              of political rebellion was in 1958, when he resigned as financial 
              secretary to the Treasury in protest over the Conservative government&rsquo;s 
              plans for increased spending. At a time when Keynesian interventionism 
              was in vogue, Powell&rsquo;s belief in free markets was regarded 
              as outmoded. Just over two decades later, Margaret Thatcher swept 
              to power on an economic program almost identical to Powell&rsquo;s. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">As the 1950s wore on, non-white immigration 
              became a significant political issue, and there was pressure from 
              some backbench Conservatives to introduce controls. Immigration 
              critic Cyril Osborne was a fellow Tory MP, but Powell took no part 
              in his movement. This was still the case even after the 1958 race 
              riots in Notting Hill and elsewhere had begun to raise serious questions 
              about the wisdom of admitting so many non-whites. Osborne himself 
              approached Powell after the riots and asked him to support the campaign 
              against immigration but Powell declined.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">In fact, as Minister of Health in 
              the early 1960s, Powell actually oversaw the recruitment of non-white 
              staff from Commonwealth countries into the National Health Service. 
              He later explained that recruitment was in the hands of individual 
              hospital authorities, and that there were no restrictions on Commonwealth 
              immigration; such controls came into effect only in July 1962, two 
              years after Powell became Minister of Health.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Still, Powell was not unconcerned 
              about the race issue. He was a member of the Kilmuir Committee, 
              which kept a watching brief on the need for immigration controls, 
              and whose discussions in 1961 led to the first imposition of restrictions. 
              During these discussions Powell favored tougher measures than those 
              eventually adopted.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Despite the imposition of controls 
              in 1962, immigration continued to increase, and by the next election 
              in October 1964 it was clear the multi-racial experiment was going 
              badly wrong. This was obvious to anyone living in the working-class 
              districts where most immigrants settled, and where a genuine sense 
              of resentment was beginning to develop. In Wolverhampton 10 percent 
              of the population was already non-white, and this time Powell raised 
              the subject in his election address. He justified the imposition 
              of controls, and attacked Labour for having obstructed and voted 
              against them at every opportunity. It was 1964 that saw Peter Griffiths&rsquo; 
              surprise victory in Smethwick and the notorious &#147;nigger&#148; 
              slogan (see cover story), but Powell took no part in the campaign. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Why was he silent for so long? Probably 
              it is because the early 1960s was the last point at which one could 
              sensibly have argued for a solution to the race problem that did 
              not involve large-scale repatriation. If a major party had gone 
              into the 1964 election advocating a moratorium on non-white immigration, 
              been elected, and then carried out its promise, the race problem 
              could perhaps have been solved-though 1959 would have been an even 
              better time for such a campaign. It was the shift in circumstances 
              that probably explains why Powell spoke out about race when he did. 
              Like millions of ordinary Britons he must have initially approved 
              of what seemed a generous policy, but became exasperated when numbers 
              began to rise beyond reason.</font></p>

            <p><font size="3">He began to describe the effects of 
              immigration in language that made a powerful impression on the public. 
              In an article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> in 1967 he wrote of 
              how entire areas of Wolverhampton had been &#147;transformed by 
              the substitution of a wholly or predominantly coloured population 
              for the previous native inhabitants as completely as other areas 
              were transformed by the bulldozer,&#148; and expressed his astonishment 
              that this event, &#147;which altered the appearance and life of 
              a town and had a shattering effect on the lives of many families 
              and persons, could take place with virtually no physical manifestation 
              of antipathy [from whites]&#148; (something even more incredible 
              today). These people, he said, had been &#147;driven from their 
              homes &hellip; by an invasion which the government apparently approved 
              and their fellow citizens-elsewhere-viewed with complacency.&#148; 
              He said it would seem incredible to subsequent generations that 
              nothing was done sooner to control the influx.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">A year later in Walsall he made a 
              speech in which he identified the &#147;sense of hopelessness and 
              helplessness which comes over persons who are trapped or imprisoned 
              when all their efforts to attract attention and assistance bring 
              no response.&#148; And he spoke again of the complacency of people 
              outside the communities which were being destroyed by this influx: 
              &#147;So far as most people in the British Isles are concerned, 
              you and I [people of his part of the West Midlands] might as well 
              be living in central Africa for all they know about our circumstances.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">One tends to think that the more vicious 
              and infantile forms of anti-racism are a recent development, but 
              the reactions to his speech are exactly what one might expect today. 
              <i>The Sunday Times</i> pilloried Powell with an editorial called 
              &#147;Powell on Prejudice.&#148; And as it would be today, the media 
              reaction was in stark contrast to that of ordinary people. Powell 
              received 800 letters, only two of which were opposed to what he 
              said. Many were from Labour supporters expressing gratitude that 
              at last someone in public life was prepared to say openly what they 
              were thinking.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Still, it is mainly for a single speech 
              that Powell is now remembered, one he gave to Conservatives in his 
              native city of Birmingham in April 1968, certain passages of which 
              have passed into popular consciousness. Upon many minds are still 
              imprinted such phrases as: </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&quot;As I look ahead, I am filled 
              with foreboding. Like the Roman, I seem to see &rsquo;the River Tiber 
              foaming with much blood.&rsquo; </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&quot;Those whom the gods wish to 
              destroy, they first make mad. We must be mad, literally mad as a 
              nation to be permitting the annual inflow of some 50,000 dependents 
              &hellip; . It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up 
              its own funeral pyre.&#148; </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">He also spoke of &#147;areas undergoing 
              the total transformation to which there is no parallel in a thousand 
              years of English history.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">He spoke with great prescience of 
              the consequences of Labour&rsquo;s race relations legislation that 
              would give immigrants the means to &#147;organise to consolidate 
              their members, to agitate and campaign against their fellow citizens, 
              and to overawe and dominate the rest with legal weapons which the 
              ignorant and the ill-informed have provided.&#148; In a biblical 
              allusion, he remarked that &#147;the kindest thing that can be said 
              about those who propose and support [the legislation] is that they 
              know not what they do.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Powerful as his language was, some 
              could argue it went too far, as when he spoke of an elderly woman, 
              the last white on her street, whom her new neighbors were trying 
              to drive out. She had excreta pushed through her letter box, Powell 
              explained, and was met in the street by &#147;charming, wide-grinning 
              pickaninnies&#148; who knew only one word of English: &#147;racialist 
              [the then-equivalent of &#147;racist&#148;].&#148; According to 
              Powell, the woman was convinced she would go to prison if the new 
              race laws were passed. (Even at that time Powell noted that many 
              people who wrote him were afraid to give their addresses.)</font></p>

            <p><font size="3">The reaction to what became known 
              as the &#147;Rivers of Blood&#148; speech was predictable: vilification 
              </font><font size="3">from the political elite and massive support 
              from the people. Tory leader Edward Heath sacked him from the shadow 
              cabinet, and an editorial in <i>The Times</i> was titled &#147;An 
              Evil Speech.&#148; Even the Wolverhampton paper <i>The Express and 
              Star</i> which had supported him, was heavily critical. It said 
              Powell could have made his points more effectively if he had used 
              more moderate language, and that it was possible to damage a case 
              by overstatement. Of course, given what is happening today, and 
              the timorousness of people who speak about race, one is tempted 
              to conclude a cause can be damaged by understatement.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Opinion polls, on the other hand, 
              showed overwhelming support for Powell and opposition to his sacking. 
              <i>The Express and Star</i> received 5,000 letters supporting Powell 
              and 300 that were critical, and only 372 of 35,000 readers who took 
              part in a postcard poll thought Mr. Heath had been right to sack 
              him. Powell received 100,000 letters within the space of a few days, 
              only 800 of which were critical, and the Post Office had to use 
              a van to deliver his mail. Mr. Heath also received a lot of mail, 
              99 percent of it in support of Powell, and many petitions from trade 
              unionists. There were pro-Powell demonstrations by trade unionists 
              in London and the West Midlands, which of course appalled Labour 
              politicians. Powell had become an establishment pariah, and at the 
              same time the country&rsquo;s most popular politician.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Returning to the backbenches, he continued 
              to make speeches on immigration, and to call for repatriation. At 
              the 1968 Tory party conference he replied to those who said repatriation 
              was not possible: &#147;Whatever the true interests of our country 
              call for is always possible.&#148; He received a rapturous welcome 
              from ordinary delegates but a rather less warm one from his political 
              colleagues.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">In a speech at Eastbourne shortly 
              afterwards, Powell warned of the &#147;deep and dangerous gulf&#148; 
              developing between ordinary people and a tiny liberal elite with 
              a virtual monopoly on the channels of communication, who &#147;seem 
              determined not to know the facts and not to face realities and who 
              will resort to any device or extremity to blind both themselves 
              and others.&#148; He called again for large-scale voluntary repatriation 
              and the creation of a Ministry of Repatriation.</font></p>

              There were particularly strong swings to the party in and around 
              Wolverhampton and to a lesser extent in the West Midlands generally, 
              and right across the country Powell&rsquo;s stance on race is credited 
              with winning the Tories votes that would ordinarily have gone to 
              Labour. His appeal was particularly strong among the working-class. 
              A stupid attack by Tony Benn, in which he described Powell&rsquo;s 
              approach as &#147;evil,&#148; and said &#147;the flag of racialism 
              which has been hoisted in Wolverhampton is beginning to look like 
              the one that fluttered over Dachau and Belsen,&#148; probably also 
              contributed to the Conservative victory.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The Tory government elected in 1970 
              further tightened immigration controls-something for which Powell 
              could rightly claim credit-and introduced a provision for a very 
              limited form of voluntary repatriation (Immigration Act 1971, section 
              29). Powell continued to campaign for repatriation on a much larger 
              scale.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">His popularity with the general public 
              endured and so did his influence on elections. He declined to stand 
              for the party at the February 1974 election in protest at its prices 
              and incomes policy and over his disagreement with membership in 
              the European Economic Community. He is widely credited with having 
              lost this election for the Tories, perhaps simply because Labour 
              voters who had been attracted to the Tories in 1970 reverted to 
              their previous allegiance when Powell did not stand. Again, particularly 
              strong swings to Labour in the West Midlands tend to support this 
              view. He himself thought he had influenced the results of both the 
              1970 and 1974 elections. As he later said of Mr. Heath, &#147;I 
              put him in and I took him out.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">After having left the Tories, he returned 
              to parliament at the October 1974 election as an Ulster Unionist 
              MP. He held this seat until 1987, and lost reelection only because 
              of redistricting that made his constituency more Nationalist. He 
              never abandoned the race issue. Speaking in the Commons in July 
              1981 after the race riots of the early Thatcher years, he placed 
              the blame squarely on non-white immigration, and again called for 
              repatriation. In 1987, in an interview with Nick Ross on Channel 
              4, he still saw the threat of an &#147;appalling&#148; civil war 
              that would be essentially racial in nature.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">As for Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s famously 
              influential remark in January 1978 on &#147;World in Action&#148; 
              about understanding people felt &#147;really rather afraid that 
              this country might be swamped by [those] with a different culture,&#148; 
              he said he first thought she shared his understanding of the problem 
              and had definite plans for dealing with it. Later he concluded she 
              had only a tendency to allow her sympathy for ordinary people to 
              lead her into statements on which she was not prepared to act.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Powell left an incomparable legacy 
              of speeches and commentary on race, but he also had strongly-held 
              views on other issues, such as Europe and Ulster. Critics argued 
              that his support of free markets was incompatible with his racial 
              views. They argued that international capitalism inevitably leads 
              to mass population movements because of inequalities in living standards 
              in different countries, and that one cannot advocate both capitalism 
              and ethnic integrity. Put differently, it is inconsistent to believe 
              in the free movement of capital but not in the free movement of 
              people. Needless to say, Hong Kong, Korea and Japan successfully 
              combine capitalism with ethnic integrity.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Others have criticized Powell for 
              his stark language, saying that for a prominent politician to speak 
              as he did bestowed respectability on &#147;extremists.&#148; Others 
              say he shut down debate about race because more moderate politicians 
              were reluctant thereafter to raise the issue at all (though this 
              is really a reflection on the cowardliness and careerism of our 
              political class rather than a criticism of Powell).</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">A perhaps more cogent criticism is 
              that though he provoked enormous public demonstrations of support, 
              it was at the price of losing his ministerial status and the means 
              to influence immigration policy at the top level. But what could 
              he really have achieved if he had not been sacked? Would he ever 
              have been able to persuade his colleagues to accept mass repatriation? 
              Could Powell really have hoped to achieve more by &#147;playing 
              the game&#148;?</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">If he had not made those provocative 
              speeches things might have been even worse. Massive public support 
              for Powell certainly influenced the subsequent tightening of immigration 
              laws, and he gave people the confidence to speak out against the 
              multi-racial experiment-at least for a time. This kind of criticism 
              seems nothing more than the tendency when all has gone wrong to 
              blame the few people who tried to do something about it. </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">At a different level, one could attack 
              his Tory reverence for British institutions, for it is these very 
              institutions that have failed us so miserably over recent decades. 
              For all their dignified, age-old grandeur they have been unable 
              to prevent the undermining of the ethnic basis of the nation. Their 
              continued existence fosters the illusion that nothing important 
              has really changed. They serve to encourage a sense of complacency 
              and a kind of deep-seated smugness about our nation&rsquo;s magnificent 
              heritage. In that sense perhaps there is some good in what the otherwise 
              egregious Blair government has done in abolishing the hereditary 
              peers. Perhaps there is more it should do in this respect. </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Powell was also an opponent of foreign 
              aid, which I believe could be part of a repatriation scheme by helping 
              boost economic growth in developing nations, in conjunction with 
              the skills and capital returning immigrants would bring. Another 
              common criticism is that Powell seemed to talk as if the problem 
              of immigration were solely a British one. He failed to see that 
              it was common to virtually all western nations. It is important 
              to be able to see a problem in its wider context and to learn from 
              people in other countries.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Finally, there is the view that he 
              gave the Conservatives an undeserved reputation for being tough 
              on immigration, which Margaret Thatcher exploited with her famous 
              &#147;swamped&#148; comment. This is relative, of course. The Conservatives 
              have never been willing to take the tough decisions necessary to 
              bring the multi-racial experiment to an end, but in comparison with 
              Labour, their reputation is not unjustified.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">What remains above all is Powell&rsquo;s 
              inspiring character: his willingness to speak the truth regardless 
              of personal consequences, his courage in the face of vilification, 
              his disdain for conventional wisdom about race, his imperviousness 
              to ostracism, his refusal to compromise, and his ability to articulate 
              the thoughts and feelings of ordinary people who were otherwise 
              neglected. He once described himself as &#147;listening for an echo,&#148; 
              by which he meant that hearing an echo of what he said confirmed 
              that he was reflecting people&rsquo;s feelings.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">What of his predictions of bloodshed? 
              It has not come on the scale he predicted, but there is always the 
              potential for cataclysm. Powell once said of the race problem that 
              &#147;the fuse is burning, but the fuse is shorter than had been 
              supposed.&#148; In fact, the fuse is longer than had been supposed, 
              not shorter. And it is still quietly burning. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="3">Enoch 
                    Powell will not go away. In March, Conservative MP John Townend 
                    of Yorkshire East evoked his name in a speech warning that 
                    &#147;Commonwealth immigration&#148; is undermining Britain&rsquo;s 
                    &#147;homogenous Anglo-Saxon society.&#148; He said illegal 
                    immigration was &#147;very, very serious&#148; and continues 
                    the unwelcome transformation set in motion by legal immigration: 
                    &#147;Having absorbed that wave of immigration, that basically 
                    was legal-and then we stopped it by the Immigration Act-we 
                    now face another wave, and the vast majority of people in 
                    this country, including my constituency, are very worried 
                    about this. There is no doubt in this country there is a great 
                    political correctness which tries to push many of these things 
                    under the table.&#148; He added that in Powell&rsquo;s day, 
                    &#147;If people had been aware that by the new Millennium, 
                    London, our capital, would have over 25 per cent of its population 
                    from ethnic minorities and that forecasts expect that by 2014 
                    over half of the city will be non Anglo-Saxon, that Leicester 
                    and Birmingham would be vying as to which city would have 
                    a black majority first, Enoch Powell would have been prime 
                    minister.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Mr. Townend&rsquo;s remarks brought 
                    down particular wrath because they came just a few days after 
                    Conservative leader Tony Hague signed an all-party pledge 
                    circulated by the Commission for Racial Equality, promising 
                    not to let election candidates say anything &#147;likely to 
                    generate hostility or division between people of different 
                    racial, national or religious groups.&#148; Every sitting 
                    MP except Mr. Townend signed this astonishing document. Mr. 
                    Townend only added oil to the fire when he later told BBC 
                    radio that although he had spoken out against &#147;Commonwealth 
                    immigration&#148; the original draft of the speech used the 
                    term &#147;colored immigration.&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">The &#147;conservative&#148; 
                    Mr. Hague promptly insisted his party is &#147;inclusive&#148; 
                    and welcomes the contributions of non-whites. He said Mr. 
                    Townend&rsquo;s remarks were &#147;totally unacceptable&#148; 
                    and &#147;will not be tolerated by my party.&#148; Tory peer 
                    Lord Taylor of Warwick, who is himself black, said, &#147;Mr. 
                    Townend&rsquo;s comments represent a nasty and ignorant element 
                    in our society, which needs to be condemned.&#148; Labour 
                    officials are calling for the Conservatives to boot Mr. Townend 
                    out of the party or at least remove him as party whip. So 
                    far, not one politician has taken his side, but his constituent 
                    mail undoubtedly makes gratifying reading. Perhaps this was 
                    why two weeks after his speech he was still sticking to his 
                    guns, saying he was entirely right to say that Britain&rsquo;s 
                    &#147;homogeneous Anglo-Saxon society&#148; had been &#147;seriously 
                    undermined&#148; by mass immigration.</font></p>
