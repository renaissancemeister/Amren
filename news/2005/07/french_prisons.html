<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>PARIS, June 19, 2005 (IslamOnline.net) &mdash; French prisons are teeming with Muslims, a phenomenon chaplains and sociologists blame on marginalization and towering poverty and unemployment rates among the Muslim minority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really harms the image of Islam and Muslims in France that prisons are teeming with Muslims,&rdquo; Mamdo Sango, a Muslim chaplain, told IslamOnline.net.</p>
<p>Iranian-French researcher Farhad Khosrokhavar said in his recently published book Islam in Prisons that Muslims make up some 70 percent of a total of 60,775 prisoners in France.</p>
<p>As ethnicity-based censuses are banned in France, he said complexion, names and religious traditions like prohibition of pork indicate that Muslims constitute an overwhelming majority in prisons.</p>
<p>Khosrokhavar also noted that Islam has become a sought-after religion in prisons with a Christian prisoner asking prison authorities to provide him with halal meat almost on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>Afro-French Sango, for his part, complained about a severe shortage in the number of Muslim chaplains in French prisons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to move from a prison to another on Fridays to meet the religious needs of Muslims prisoners,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>There are only 69 Muslim chaplains in a total of 185 prisons, a figure which is dwarfed by 500 Catholic chaplains.</p>
<p>France is home to some six to seven million Muslims, the largest Muslim minority in Europe.</p>
<p>Failed Policies</p>
<p>Although none of the French Muslim organizations approached by IOL had a clear answer to the mind-boggling phenomenon, some heaped blame on failed integration policies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The successive French governments failed to come up with a successful integration policy,&rdquo; said Ammar Al-Asfar, a Muslim prison chaplain.</p>
<p>Asfar, who doubles as the prison affairs official at the umbrella French Council for Muslim Faith (CFCM), said French governments should have adopted programs putting all French citizens on equal footing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young French Muslims are more vulnerable to fall prey to depression and suffer the grave consequences of academic failure and family break-up,&rdquo; he told IOL.</p>
<p>Sociologists and French Muslim leaders further hold racism and discrimination as the root cause of unemployment and crime rates among the Muslim minority.</p>
<p>French Muslims and Arabs are pinning high hopes on the appointment of a Muslim of Algerian origin as junior minister in charge of equal opportunity under the new cabinet of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.</p>
<p>Azouz Begag, 48, has already gained the reputation of being a fighter for equality and a struggler against all sorts of discrimination.</p>
<p>A Sorbonne research released earlier in the year by the French Observatory Against Racism found that Arab names and dark complexion represent an obstacle to jobseekers.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Discrimination at Workplace&rdquo; research said that the organization sent 325 CVs of competitive applicants, who only differ in names and origin, to find that the opportunity for North African applicants to get a job is five times less than natives.</p>
<p>Fanaticism</p>
<p>French analysts further warned that prisons might be a breeding ground for extremists.</p>
<p>They cited the case of a young Muslim, Khaled Khilkhal, who was blamed by the authorities of involvement in terrorist operations.</p>
<p>Some experts claim he was influenced by extremist ideas in prison though he used to lead an extravagant life before serving time.</p>
<p>Secretary of State to the Rights of the Victims Nicole Guedi has also warned that fanaticism was gaining ground among Muslim prisoners, mostly aged 18-35.</p>
<p>Prison authorities have even become phobic about rising fanaticism in prisons to the extent that they sometimes deny Muslim prisoners the right to have prayer rugs, Asfar said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is paradoxical that prison authorities seek the help of those so-called extremist prisoners to maintain public order when quarrels erupt as they are revered by most of the prisoners,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>In April, the Fleury-Merogis prison in south Paris punished a Muslim prisoner with eight days in solitary confinement for performing a congregational prayer.</p>
<p>The Administrative Court in Versailles, however, did the prisoner justice and reaffirmed his right to practice his religion.</p>
