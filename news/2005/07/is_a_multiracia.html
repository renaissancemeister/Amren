<p><font size="3"><p>Of all the ways in which a nation defines itself, few are more important than what it teaches its children about itself. In the history classes of its public schools, a nation retells its own story and instills a national identity in the minds of young citizens. In today&rsquo;s America, where competing racial, cultural, and linguistic claims now make it nearly impossible even to speak of national identity, questions about history have become a struggle for the possession of America&rsquo;s past. </p>
<p>The multicultural, multiperspective history that has arisen from this struggle is not merely a departure from the history America has always taught its children. It may be the first time that a nation has abandoned the single identity of its origins and set out deliberately to adopt multiple national identities. </p>
<p>Significantly, the understanding by many non-whites of multicultural history is entirely different from that of whites. For whites, the central concepts are &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; and &ldquo;pluralism.&rdquo; American history is to be rewritten so that racial and cultural perspectives that were once &ldquo;ignored&rdquo; or &ldquo;neglected&rdquo; will get equal treatment. For many non-whites, however, multicultural history is merely a step on the way to an explicitly racial, Afro-centric or Hispanic history. Their goal is separation rather than inclusion. </p>
<p>The &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; view is that explicitly racial histories are illegitimate. America, it is argued, must be united by a common history, and exclusionist histories will disunite us. This position is logically correct; exclusionist histories are divisive. But as we shall see, the &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; position is wrong &mdash; practically, emotionally, and even morally. America is already disunited by race, and no approach to history can change that. Just as it would be impossible to use the same history book in both France and England, it is impossible to write a single American history that satisfies, white, black, Indian, Hispanic, and Asian. </p>
<p>Schooling as Assimilation </p>
<p>The purpose of American public education has never been simply to impart knowledge. One of its central goals has been to make children into Americans. American schools fly the American flag and students pledge allegiance to it. The central events of history are from the American past. The most glorious achievements are American achievements. There is nothing odd about that. Every nation gives its children a national education. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, American schools have had an even more explicitly nation-building purpose than others because of the need to assimilate immigrants. John Quincy Adams wrote that immigrants &ldquo;must cast off their European skin, never to resume it.&rdquo; Horace Mann argued that &ldquo;a foreign people &hellip; cannot be transformed into the full stature of American citizens merely by a voyage across the Atlantic.&rdquo; One of the strongest motives for building public schools was, therefore, the need to make Americans out of Europeans. </p>
<p>Europeans weren&rsquo;t going to be made into Americans by teaching them about the contributions of Africans, Mexicans and Indians. The old, standard history united Americans because it had a coherent purpose and a single voice. It emphasized one point of view and ignored others. To put it bluntly, it was history about white people for white people. </p>
<p>This history served the country well, so long as the population was overwhelmingly white, and the two traditional minorities &mdash; blacks and Indians &mdash; did not have voices. All this changed, beginning in the 1960s. The civil rights movement gave voices to blacks and Indians, and changes in immigration laws brought a massive influx of non-whites. It was the end of a certain kind of America. </p>
<p>Non-whites began to complain about a version of history that left them out. The nation-building history that had bound Europeans into a single people had not bound whites and non-whites into a single people. &ldquo;Multicultural&rdquo; history was therefore to be a broader, more inclusive history that would give every American his rightful share of America&rsquo;s past. At the same time, &ldquo;culturally relevant&rdquo; history would keep blacks and Hispanics in school and stop them from dropping out at ever-increasing rates. </p>
<p>Squaring the Circle </p>
<p>Something that well-meaning whites did not understand is that an &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; history &mdash; one that would be all things to all people &mdash; is impossible. History has winners and losers, and they see the same events with different eyes. At the same time, virtually every non-white group sees the conflicts of the past as struggles with whites, so multicultural history becomes a collection of perspectives that are often not merely non-white but anti-white. </p>
<p>How, for example, is a multicultural history to treat the discovery and settlement of North America by Europeans? The old history called it a triumphant advance for civilization. But for Indians, the same historical events are an unending sequence of defeats and disasters. Does a multicultural textbook call this a triumph or a disaster or both or neither? </p>
<p>What about the Spanish-American War? At the time, it was thought a glorious success because it added huge chunks to the American West. But was it instead, an imperialist atrocity? Are today&rsquo;s school children to rejoice that California is part of America or are they to weep over the stolen birthright of their Hispanic brothers? </p>
<p>Slavery poses a similar riddle. Blacks want to make it the centerpiece of their history, and in many ways it is. For nearly 300 years, most American blacks were slaves, and virtually everything that blacks did or thought was circumscribed by slavery. Today, it is still the centerpiece of black history, because it excuses failure and can be used to extract benefits from whites. </p>
<p>For whites, though, slavery is a minor historical event. Except for the Civil War (which was set in motion and fought by whites) the course of the nation&rsquo;s history would hardly have been different if there had been no slavery. To give it a prominent place in white history is a transparent effort to manipulate the way that whites think about the present. </p>
<p>Once slavery is promoted to the status of unparalleled evil, much of the past becomes incomprehensible. Is George Washington both the Father of his Country and a wicked man because he owned slaves? Is Abraham Lincoln the storied savior of the Union or is he a fiend because he thought blacks were inferior and should be sent back to Africa? </p>
<p>Those of us who went to school when American history still had coherence are likely to learn about the new, multicultural history only by accident. One such accident is that this year is the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America. A typical multicultural problem has thus spilled out of the classroom and gotten wider notice: Was Columbus a great explorer or was he a genocidal tyrant? Are we to celebrate half a millennium of European America or are we to hang our heads in shame? Or are we to do both? </p>
<p>Problems and Uncertainties </p>
<p>Multicultural histories, by their very nature, cannot answer these questions. And because they cannot, they present American history as a bundle of uncertainties, as a series of unsolved &ldquo;problems.&rdquo; Unlike the old history, which viewed the past with pride and the future with confidence, multicultural histories are diffident and perplexed. Unlike the old history, which at least gave white children a firm foundation for national identity, multicultural history says, in effect, that America has no identity. The only thing left to unite a multicultural America is geography. </p>
<p>One way to understand the impossible task that multicultural history has set itself is to imagine how one would write a school history book to be used in both France and Britain. How would it treat Napoleon? The very geography of London &mdash; Waterloo Station, Trafalger Square &mdash; is a monument to Englishmen who killed Frenchmen. Napoleon&rsquo;s tomb, Austerlitz station, and street names like Jena and Ulm all mark the pride the French take in their ancestors&rsquo; readiness to slaughter foreigners. A &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; history book of the Napoleonic wars would be an absurdity, and everyone knows it. And yet, it would be no more absurd than the history books American children use today. </p>
<p>Non-whites have a much keener sense of their group interests than whites. They see very clearly that the future will have its winners and losers, just as history had them. Thus, while virtually every school district with a white majority is trying to square the circle by teaching a history that is everything to everyone, school districts with black majorities are beginning to replace the old &ldquo;Euro-centric&rdquo; curriculum with one that is openly &ldquo;Afro-centric.&rdquo; They are not interested in supplementing the traditional history with different points of view. They want a single, African point of view. </p>
<p>In Atlanta, where 92 percent of the public school students are black, history and social studies courses have been rewritten from an &ldquo;African-American&rdquo; perspective. New York&rsquo;s public schools recently authorized a curriculum revision based on an openly anti-white position paper drafted, in part, by the black-supremacist professor, Leonard Jeffries (see AR, October, 1991). In California, school districts in heavily-black Oakland and East Palo Alto started the 1991/1992 school year without social studies textbooks. They decided to develop their own black-centered materials because they could find nothing suitable. </p>
<p>Private black schools have gone the farthest (see sidebar). Some reject America, and teach their pupils that they are the African diaspora. Many teach patent nonsense, claiming that the ancient Egyptians and even King Solomon were black. Nevertheless, even if some of their material is ridiculous, Afro-centric teachers have recognized something that white teachers have forgotten: History has a point of view; it cannot be all things to all people. </p>
<p>Building a Nation </p>
<p>Blacks, then, are learning the kind of history that whites once learned &mdash; a history that builds identity and certitude. White children are learning that every interpretation is valid, that nothing is certain, that their nation&rsquo;s past is all paradoxes and unsolved problems. Patriotism will not grow in the heart of a child who cannot look back with pride upon his nation&rsquo;s past. We have come a long way from schooling that made Europeans into Americans. We now make Americans into nothing at all. </p>
<p>Multicultural history is like affirmative action. Just as whites are to step aside to give hiring preferences to minorities, whites are to set aside their own point of view and study those of others. Non-whites, on the other hand, are free to promote their own interests and exclusionist histories. </p>
<p>Like affirmative action, multicultural history is possible only because the majority has abandoned its position at the center. If whites insisted on their own history as strongly as non-whites insist on theirs, the inevitability of separate histories would have been recognized long ago. Nor will whites be willing to forego their own history for ever. They will eventually realize that only they are studying a past with no answers and no certainties. They will eventually see that there cannot be one history that satisfies all. And they will begin to wonder whether there can be one nation that satisfies</p>

  <font size="3"><p>While I didn&rsquo;t teach Social Studies at the New York City public high school I was at for the past two years, I can attest that the anti-white bias in Social Studies, as well as literature, was very strong. </p>
<p>However, what I see the trend is at present is that even whites are going to be forced to study history with a strong anti-white bias, and made to feel that almost everything their ancestors said and did is something for them to be ashamed of. </p>
<p>The next step, after this sense of having a Nazi-like past is incorporated into their psyches, is for white youth to make a cultural transfer and become like the new role model, Eminem, who is a white rapper and emulates blacks - but the likes of him is to be the acceptable wave of the future.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Multicultural?  Yes.  Belgium has had it&rsquo;s share of problems between the French-speaking Catholics (Walloons) and the Dutch-speaking Protestants (Flemings), but was relatively stable, and genuinely prosperous before the Third World immigration boom started.  Local autonomy was the key to domestic peace, as was the nation&rsquo;s prosperity.</p>
<p>Switzerland has a mix of ethnic Germans, Italians and French.  Local autonomy within the Cantons, Switzerland&rsquo;s famous prosperity and a national desire to avoid entanglement in Europe&rsquo;s destructive wars (and the terrain features to make that easy) has made for domestic peace.</p>
<p>Singapore is a more recent experiment, and has a mixture of ethnic Chinese, Indians and Malays.  A fanatical dictatorship dedicated to keeping Singapore clean, safe and prosperous, and the obviously successful results Lee Kwan Yew&rsquo;s regieme has produced have served to maintain domestic peace.</p>
<p>Ethnic Italians, Spanish, Germans and Anglos seem to get along well in Argentina.  Prosperity, relative to the rest of the region, again is high.</p>
<p>In Hawaii and California, Japanese, Chinese, Koreans and whites get along peacefully.  It&rsquo;s the Polynesians in Hawaii and the blacks and Mexicans in California that cause most of the interethnic trouble, plus Vietnamese in both states.  </p>
<p>In the United States a century ago, Irish, Italians and Jews got along well enough to form American organized crime.  Traditional old-world enemies, like English and Scots, Germans and Poles, and French and Anglo-Germans were never at each other&rsquo;s throats here.  Jews and Gentiles still distrust each other to some extent, but the rate of intermarriage - over 50% - makes the point largely moot.  The same goes for Japanese and whites.  Japanese in the US were distrusted before World War Two, disliked afterward, and desperately hated during the war, but there was never open racial conflict, and Japanese follow the Jewish model here, where intermarriage with white gentiles is concerned.  Two thirds of the women and a third of the men marry whites.  Not that both of <span class="caps">O.J.</span> Simpson&rsquo;s judges were ethnic Japanese men who had married white women and then <span class="caps">NOT MURDERED THEM. </span> In the old South, I believe the situation with the Cherokee was quite similar.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m getting at is that multicultural societies can be peaceful and stable, provided the different elements are all civilized, productive, and share approximately the same expectations of social order.  It helps if they are all approximately the same color, and it helps enormously if prosperity prevails.  People who are already civilized can be co-opted.  They don&rsquo;t play grievance games with each other.  Local autonomy helps very much if the different elements are separated by region.  Despotism can be a useful temporary alternative; Stalin&rsquo;s book on nationalities is one I have here in my home library.</p>
<p>When two races are different enough, or two cultures different enough, there can be no peaceful coexistance.  This fact will be the death knell of the multicultural doctrine, as well as a great many of us in the developed West.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>One must be careful in using the term multicultural.  It is one thing to refer to different western cultures, say to english and italian culture.  It is quite a different thing to use the term to refer to western and non-western cultures.  The United States was a successful nation when it was composed almost completely of western european immigrants.  Because of the shared western culture it was possible to form a nation which by definition has some meaningful degree of social and cultural cohesion.</p>
<p>The United States today is becoming a multicultural society in the negative sense of the term, including radically divergent non western cultures.  As such it is increasingly ceasing to function as a nation.  Since the 1965 immigration reforms passed by congress and signed into law by the then president we have been launched on the road to becoming not only a third world country, but a third world country rife with ethnic and racial strife.  Such a state is the most unstable and degraded concievable.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The confusion about multiculturalism arises, in part, because what&rsquo;s meant isn&rsquo;t multicultrualism but multiracism. I don&rsquo;t believe any society has endured that is a mixture of races, nor has there been peace among the various races. As Amren has pointed out previously, only those who have created a culture can maintain it. </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Multiculturalism interferes with Whites coming to terms with real issues that should only be argued internally among Whites and can only be put on the back burner at a cost. Upton Sinclair&rsquo;s &#8216;The Jungle&rsquo;, written<br>
in 1906, is remembered for the disgusting meat packing practices, but he relates how the factory oweners imported black workers from the South to break strikes in Chicago. If a racial wedge is driven in an issue like this, nothing can be settled for the working person in an effective way, as the intruding outside racial element is a &#8216;middle&rsquo; that sucks up like a parasite any benefit or even any simple negotiation between the two orginal parties. It&rsquo;s difficult for Whites to interrupt their selves in their own terms without relating it <br><br>
in some essential way to other races. We&rsquo;re like an adolescent<br><br>
that has to move away from home to find out who we are in independence. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be interesting if we could totally<br><br>

<p>Canada eh?  Let&rsquo;s give it another hundred years or two.  But I am guessing that we will see the &#8216;benefits&rsquo; of multi-culturalism in Canada several decades before that.  Couple of reminders about Canada:</p>
<p>Canada was wealthy and stable before multi-culturalism became a religion there and before the third world populations started to arrive.  Keep that in mind. </p>
<p>The fast demographic changes have started happening only very recently.  Right now most of the third world populations are concentrated in a few of big cities - but Canada has mostly a natural resource based economy.  What does that mean?  The third world populations are not numerous yet to make enough of a difference and Canada is wealthy enough from its resources (managed by what some would call the &#8216;anglo&rsquo; population) to buy their grievences off - which there are many - and which Canada does on regular bases. <br>
 <br><br>
Canada does not rely on its third world population for economic well-being, let&rsquo;s see what happens when it does (once white boomers die off) and/or when it doesn&rsquo;t have enough money to buy the third worlders off.  After-all they have SO many complaints.</p>
<p>Another angle:  Look at third-world neigbourhoods like Scarborough and Bramptom and how they are doing - and ask yourself - what&rsquo;s the future of Canada?<br>
Another angle:  How much corruption is there in Canada today?  How much was there in 1960?  How much do you think will there be in 2050?<br><br>
Another angle: Once the chinese finish taking over areas like Vancouver - will they give it back?  Why should they?  Will you (ok, your grand kids) get a job there in 2100?  Are your grand children willing to learn cantonese?  Are they willing to cut lawns for living?  Look at the population patterns in Singapore&hellip; and look at how the English ran. But then again Singapore is quickly seizing to be a multi-cultural nation - get the drift here?</p>
<p>Last point:  when ever people say that multi-culturalism works in Canada I say - what about Quebec?  They say what about it?  I say: here you have two populations (French and English) who on a genetic scale are about as close to each other as you can get. And how do they get along?  </p>
<p>And the answer&hellip;<br>
Barely!  No one ever disputes that.</p>
<p>Canada, oh Canada&hellip; keep praying to your multi-cultural gods&hellip; communists also prayed to their brotherhood gods.  If you say it enough it will come true&hellip; right???  It did for communists - did it not???  <span class="caps">DID</span> IT <span class="caps">NOT</span>???  They were all happy brothers!  Weren&rsquo;t they?  And we will all be happy multi-culturalists!  Oh yeah!</p>
<p>Ideology trumps human nature&hellip; right professor Frankfurt?  Right, now shut-up and go watch <span class="caps">TV. </span></p>

<p>What country do you consider home? To me its always been the <span class="caps">USA.</span> Never thought of anywhere else. Lately im feeling uprooted. Thats because the more i talk to people, the more i&rsquo;m finding out that people dont consider this their &#8220;home country&#8221;. <br>
Its like we&rsquo;ve become huge apartment complex that is now renting more units than are owned, with the very building we reside in, becoming rapidly owned by someone outside of this country.</p>
<p>That brings to thought of who would <span class="caps">WANT </span>(not who is forced) to defend this complex under siege? I think most will just scatter to their other &#8220;home land&#8221; and leave the rest of the original owners to die or suffer. Whats even worse is there is still a room waiting for them if we are victorious.<br>
