						<p>Immigrants may have to pass a French language test if they want long-term residence rights in the country, a junior social affairs minister said yesterday. </p>
<p>In a further tightening of already strict immigration laws, Catherine Vautrin, the state secretary for social cohesion and women&rsquo;s rights, said the French government aimed to create &ldquo;a link&rdquo; between linguistic competence and the granting of a 10-year residence permit. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to encourage as much as possible the integration of new arrivals,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At present there is no language requirement, and I believe one is necessary. What interests us is successful immigration &mdash; and behind language lies employment, accommodation, everything.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Few EU states require immigrants to master their language. Britain, Spain and Italy only demand an ID card and an employment contract before issuing a residence permit. But in Germany, applicants for permanent residence must pass a language and general culture test, and Austria and Denmark have introduced similar measures. </p>
<p>Ms Vautrin was speaking at a centre in the south-western city of Lyon where some of the 110,00 to 120,000 legal immigrants who arrive in France each year &mdash; refugees, economic migrants and family members of existing residents &mdash; go for basic tuition in the laws and principles of the republic as well as to sign a &ldquo;Welcome and Integration Contract&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The contract, written in a dozen languages including Arab, Russian, Chinese, Vietnamese and Hindi, was introduced three years ago to remind immigrants that France is an &ldquo;indivisible, secular and social&rdquo; state, that religion is a private matter and that men and women are equal. </p>
<p>Officials say about 90% of immigrants who are granted a French residence permit have signed the document, which entitles them to 500 hours of non-compulsory French language teaching and a two-day civic education course. </p>
<p>The programme is supposed to make it easier for immigrants to renew temporary residence permits and, eventually, acquire French nationality. It costs the government €60m (£41.7bn) a year. Some 8,000 immigrants signed the contract in 2003, and 37,000 last year. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Language is a problem,&rdquo; Ms Vautrin said. &ldquo;Only 60% of new arrivals take lessons and it&rsquo;s not enough. For married women in particular it&rsquo;s important: to live their lives in France they have to be independent, and the first condition of independence is to be able to speak our language.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, last month asked an inter-ministerial committee to study ways to &ldquo;ensure immigration is more closely tailored to France&rsquo;s economic needs&rdquo; &mdash; seen by many critics as a hint that France was prepared to introduce quotas for legal immigration. </p>
<p>But Paris also recently unveiled a package of tough new measures aimed at combating illicit immigration. Putting the number of illegal aliens in France at between 200,000 and 400,000, Mr de Villepin said it was &ldquo;far, far too easy&rdquo; for people to enter on a tourist visa and then stay on illegally. If caught they could claim to have no papers and to be unaware of their nationality, preventing any expulsion, he said. </p>
<p>France aims to boost expulsions by up to 30% a year, the prime minister said, partly by creating a special 600-strong &ldquo;immigration police&rdquo; and an immigration control service to coordinate the activities of the police, gendarmerie, local authorities and government departments. </p>
<p>· The French interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, said yesterday that in the wake of the second wave of terrorist bomb attacks in London, he was launching a &ldquo;major operation to track down the radicalising elements&rdquo; &mdash; mainly radical imams &mdash; among France&rsquo;s 6 million Muslims . </p>
<p>Mr Sarkozy said France would &ldquo;substantially increase&rdquo; the security services&rsquo; budgets. &ldquo;Everyone in France has the right to practise his religion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But when you see the images of the kamikazes in London you see the responsibility of radical preachers for young minds. I do not intend to tolerate it.&rdquo;</p>
