<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>They had been milling around for an hour in the sun, 2,000 restless, agitated teens packed onto Jefferson High&rsquo;s football field, waiting for the earthquake drill to end and lunch to begin. When the bell rang they rushed the gates, shoving, elbowing, knocking classmates aside.</p>
<p>In the crush, two black girls began tussling over a cellphone or a boy, or maybe a boy&rsquo;s cellphone.</p>
<p>As school police officers dug them out of the center of a heckling crowd, a Latino boy launched a milk carton across the quad. It landed in a group of black football players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who threw the milk carton?&rdquo; one demanded, confronting the Latino boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to Africa!&rdquo; was one shouted response.</p>
<p>The entire quad erupted in fights.</p>
<p>In that brief moment, a food fight became a race riot. And in the days and weeks that followed, racial skirmishes on this and other Southern California campuses unmasked a current of racial tension that has alarmed law enforcement and school officials.</p>
<p>The Jefferson fight was over in less than 20 minutes. But for two months after that April 14 battle, Jefferson&rsquo;s black and Latino students faced off in spontaneous skirmishes, orchestrated beatings and at least two more large-scale melees. Twenty-five students were arrested, three hospitalized and dozens suspended or transferred. Hundreds more stayed away from classes, and those who showed up did so with fear.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A close look at the first Jefferson fight shows how racial tensions can quickly balkanize a campus &mdash; even one where peacemakers outnumber troublemakers.</p>
<p>Steve Bachrach teaches in the school&rsquo;s Film and Theater Academy, a self-contained &ldquo;small learning community&rdquo; on campus. He was in his classroom with students when the quad fight began.</p>
<p>A student ran past the room yelling, &ldquo;Food fight!&rdquo; Bachrach shrugged it off. But a few minutes later another kid shouted, &ldquo;Race riot &mdash; brown on black!&rdquo; and several of his students bolted. Outside, Bachrach saw half a dozen kids scaling the school&rsquo;s chain-link fence, desperately trying to escape from campus.</p>
<p>Bachrach headed for the quad to retrieve his students and found one, a black girl, in a standoff with three Latino boys. She had been beaten and was in obvious pain. He ushered her back to class, where a group of her Latina classmates, all juniors, gathered to console her and press for details. &ldquo;I was jumped by a bunch of &hellip; Mexicans,&rdquo; she said. The group, almost all of them Mexican immigrants, brushed the expletive off as anger speaking.</p>
<p>But across the room, a group of younger Latinas bristled. They strode over, and one angrily challenged the black girl: &ldquo;Why are you disrespecting me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older girls quickly intervened, ordering the others to back off. The younger girls retreated, but not before belittling their Latina classmates for having &ldquo;no pride in your own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the months since that first lunchtime fight, many others faced the same brutal choice: &ldquo;race pride&rdquo; came to trump friendships, common interests and personal history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Basically, I guess you can say that you had to pick sides. It was just a must,&rdquo; said Yessinia Rivas, 18, a senior who has since graduated.</p>
<p>Her worried parents gave her advice she didn&rsquo;t expect: For your own protection, they said, stay away from other people. Her Latino friends demanded she declare allegiance. &ldquo;Either you were with them or against them,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Pressure From Peers</p>
<p>In an essay for the independent teen publication &ldquo;LA Youth,&rdquo; an anonymous Latino student described being drawn into the initial fight by friends&rsquo; demands that he &ldquo;stand up for my family, my Mexican ancestors, and the people who worked hard so I could be here &mdash; my heritage that I&rsquo;m really proud of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt good defending my race,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;I was hitting anybody I could get my hands on &hellip; . Many of my friends who knew I was involved in the fight asked me, &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you proud that our people are at war with the blacks?&rsquo; &hellip; Because of that fight, I lost many friends who are African American. The whole tension between Latinos and blacks is changing the way we all think about each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The school reflects the changing demographics of inner-city Los Angeles. In 25 years, the student body has gone from 31% Latino to 92% Latino. More than half of Jefferson&rsquo;s Latino students are immigrants, most of them from Mexico, where only 1% of the population is black. During the 1990s, the black population of Jefferson&rsquo;s attendance area declined from about 34,000 to less than 22,000 while the Latino population, mostly recently arrived Mexicans, grew from 105,000 to 121,000, according to the U.S. Census.</p>
