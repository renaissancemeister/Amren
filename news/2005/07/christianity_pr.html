						<p><font size="3">In 
                2001, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), the 
                Bush administration&rsquo;s ambitious public education law. Its 
                main goal is to close the student achievement gap between whites, 
                blacks, and Hispanics, and will reward schools that narrow it 
                and punish those that do not. The White House is convinced that 
                if no other administration could close the gap, it was because 
                no one understood the power of accountability programs and charter 
                schools.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">This is a goal that cannot be achieved 
                and reflects a staggering lack of realism. The main result of 
                the law will be more fraud in the education system. Schools already 
                cook the books to make their students look better, and the punishments 
                President Bush has in mind will only give them more reasons to 
                cheat. On the other hand, when this attempt to eliminate the racial 
                gap inevitably fails, it will open more eyes to the reality of 
                racial differences.</font></p>

              <p><font size="3">NCLB requires that all students 
                who are not officially &#147;learning disabled&#148; be &#147;proficient&#148; 
                in reading and math by the end of the 2013-14 school year, and 
                that schools show &#147;adequate yearly progress&#148; towards 
                that goal in the meantime. &#147;Proficiency&#148; will be defined 
                by the states which must come up with &#147;high-quality tests&#148; 
                for it. By the 2005-6 school year, all schools must test students 
                in reading and math every year in grades three to eight, and at 
                least once during grades ten through twelve. Schools must also 
                develop plans to reduce dropout rates, and show they are sticking 
                to them.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The law also sets qualification 
                requirements for teachers, and requires that schools cut down 
                on crime and violence. It is supposed to help them prevent and 
                prosecute crime by improving communication between schools and 
                police, but it also punishes schools classified as &#147;persistently 
                dangerous.&#148; </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The act massively increases education 
                spending. Since it was passed in 2001, federal grants to schools 
                have increased 28 percent, from $28 billion to $35.8 billion. 
                Much of the money is for teacher recruitment and training, reading 
                instruction, and special education, but a whopping $11.7 billion 
                now goes to &#147;Title One&#148; schools, that is, schools that 
                get extra money because their students are poor. This is an increase 
                of 33 percent over 2001, and was required by No Child Left Behind. 
                Poverty is so rewarding it has become the fashion: No fewer than 
                58 percent of public schools now get Title One money. The program 
                has increased more under Mr. Bush than during the entire eight 
                years of the Clinton administration.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">But NCLB can take as well as give. 
                If a Title One school fails to make enough progress for two straight 
                years, the school district must let its students go to other, 
                better schools. If the school still fails to improve, the district 
                must start replacing staff and perhaps even reopen it as a charter 
                school. (A charter school is relatively free from the education 
                bureaucracy: Principals can hire non-union teachers, and have 
                more say in curriculum and budgeting than other principals.) The 
                law rewards schools that meet federal standards by giving them 
                more money.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">In order to spur schools to close 
                the racial gap, the law judges a school&rsquo;s performance not 
                by the overall student average, but by the performances of blacks, 
                whites, Hispanics, and Asians, as well as poor students, the &#147;limited 
                English proficient,&#148; and so forth. Therefore, if all the 
                students in the school make adequate progress except for blacks, 
                the school still fails to meet federal standards. There will be 
                lower standards for low-performing groups until 2014, but in that 
                year every single student of every group (except for the &#147;learning 
                disabled&#148;) must achieve proficiency. </font></p>

              <p><font size="3">Teachers and journalists have attacked 
                the act for its delusional optimism, and rightly so. The most 
                widely-used test for measuring performance is the National Assessment 
                of Educational Progress exam (NAEP). In 2002, only 36 percent 
                of 12th graders were &#147;proficient&#148; or better on the NAEP 
                reading test. That was 42 percent of whites, 16 percent of blacks, 
                and 22 percent of Hispanics. In 2000, the latest available year 
                for math scores, only 17 percent of 12th graders were &#147;proficient:&#148; 
                20 percent of whites, but only three percent of blacks, and four 
                percent of Hispanics. It is inconceivable that every student in 
                America will be &#147;proficient&#148; in math and reading by 
                2014. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Some people argue that the NAEP 
                score of &#147;proficient&#148; is a very high standard, and &#147;proficiency&#148; 
                will end up closer to the NAEP score of &#147;basic.&#148; Even 
                this more modest goal is impossible. In 2002, 79 percent of white 
                12th graders, but only 54 percent of blacks, and 61 percent of 
                Hispanics met this standard in reading. In math, 74 percent of 
                white, but only 44 percent of Hispanic, and 31 percent of black 
                students were &#147;basic&#148; or better. Therefore, even if 
                the standard is equivalent to NAEP &#147;basic,&#148; blacks and 
                Hispanics will have to make tremendous progress.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Some states have already adopted 
                the NCLB system of evaluating each racial group separately rather 
                than grading a school on average performance of all students. 
                The result is a huge increase in &#147;failing schools,&#148; 
                and is a taste of what is to come. In Florida, for example, no 
                fewer than 87 percent of schools failed to make &#147;adequate 
                yearly progress&#148; last year; for South Carolina, New Jersey, 
                and Delaware, the figures were 77 percent, 58 percent, and 57 
                percent. In California, 800 schools flunked the state&rsquo;s evaluation, 
                but when all racial groups were evaluated separately the way NCLB 
                requires, <i>3,000 schools </i>failed. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">NCLB has other crazy requirements. 
                It will, for example, be impossible for schools to be fully staffed 
                with &#147;highly qualified&#148; teachers&mdash;by federal standards&mdash;by 
                the 2005 school year. Only 63 percent of math teachers nationwide 
                now meet the standard. Also, students in &#147;failing&#148; schools 
                are supposed to be able to transfer to better ones, but this policy 
                won&rsquo;t work because the good schools are full. In 2003, 19,000 
                Chicago students asked to transfer, but there were places for 
                only 1,000 of them. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Of course, schools can be expanded 
                and teachers can be qualified. It is the goal of closing the racial 
                gap that is fantastic. Always, everywhere, whites and Asians outscore 
                blacks and Hispanics. To require schools to close the gap is to 
                encourage them to lie.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">This gap is large and persistent. 
                In fact, test results show that by the time they finish high school, 
                minorities (unless otherwise specified, this means blacks and 
                Hispanics) are approximately four academic years behind whites. 
                Their achievement test scores in 12th grade are, at best, about 
                equal to those of whites in the 8th grade, and sometimes dramatically 
                lower. The graph below this paragraph, taken from <i>No Excuses 
                </i>by Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom (see sidebar, page 6) deserves 
                careful study. Please note that the racial comparisons are not 
                of children in the same grade, but of 8th grade whites and Asians 
                and 12th grade blacks and Hispanics. It shows that an employer 
                who hires a black or Hispanic with a high school diploma will, 
                on average, get the intellectual equivalent of a white 14-year-old. 
                Things are actually even worse. Only slightly more than half of 
                blacks and Hispanics even graduate from high school, as opposed 
                to 72 percent of whites, so the dropouts are even more miserably 
                qualified. </font></p>
              <p align="center"><img src="/news/2005/07/LINEARTsml.JPG" width="504" height="330"></p>
              <p><font size="3">The gap is not closing. The graphs 
                on the next page, also taken from the Thernstrom&rsquo;s informative 
                book, show where the average score of black and Hispanic 17-year-olds 
                fell in the white percentile distribution between 1975 and 1999 
                on NAEP tests of reading and science. Thus, if the black score 
                is 25, it means 75 percent of whites scored better than the average 
                black. The science scores are particularly dismal. In 1999, 90 
                percent of white 17-year-olds scored higher than the average black, 
                and 78 percent scored higher than the average Hispanic. In the 
                past 29 years, neither minority group has ever scored higher than 
                the 30th percentile of the white distribution in reading, math 
                or science. Between 1975 and 1990, blacks and Hispanics narrowed 
                the gap with whites on the reading test, but it has widened since 
                then. In math and science, the racial gap has scarcely changed 
                at all since 1975</font></p>

              <p align="center"><img src="/news/2005/07/SCIENCEsml.JPG" width="504" height="362"></p>
              <p><font size="3">Scores on the Scholastic Achievement 
                Test (SAT) show the same pattern. In 1976, there was a 240-point 
                gap between black and white combined scores, and the difference 
                narrowed to 189 points in 1988. Since then, the gap has grown 
                larger again, reaching 206 points in 2003. The gap between whites 
                and Hispanics has changed in the same way. In 1976, there was 
                a 163-point gap between whites and Mexicans, which narrowed to 
                124 points in 1990, and is now back to 158. The scores of other 
                Hispanic groups show the same pattern.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Liberals and conservatives have 
                different explanations for the gap. Liberals blame poverty, racism, 
                and school funding. Conservatives blame bad teaching, school bureaucracy, 
                and &#147;minority culture.&#148; The classic liberal statement 
                was Jonathan Kozol&rsquo;s 1991 best-seller, <i>Savage Inequalities</i>. 
                Mr. Kozol argued that considerably less money was spent per capita 
                on minority than on white students and that minority schools were 
                therefore squalid and overcrowded. He examined a few inner-city 
                schools and compared them to better schools in rich suburbs, but 
                did not try to prove his examples were typical by looking at large-scale 
                studies. He believed money would eliminate the performance gap.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3"><i>No Excuses </i>decisively refutes 
                Mr. Kozol. The Thernstroms look at average spending on minority 
                and white students in the period Mr. Kozol covered&mdash;1989 to 
                1990&mdash;and find there were only negligible differences in per-student 
                spending by race. Since then, the trend has been towards almost 
                complete equality in spending on whites and minorities. This reflects

              <p><font size="3">The Thernstroms also make short 
                work of another &#147;savage inequality,&#148; class size. At 
                the time Mr. Kozol was writing, class sizes were actually smaller 
                at mostly-minority than at mostly-white schools. The average across 
                the board was 17.7 in 1992, in the range educators call &#147;ideal.&#148; 
                Since then, average class size has dropped to 15.1. The Thernstroms 
                acknowledge that some high-minority schools are squalid, but blame 
                this on negligent school employees and destructive students rather 
                than on lack of funding.</font></p>
              <div align="left"></div>
              <p><font size="3">The Thernstroms are rightly skeptical 
                of any claim that more money will close the racial gap or produce 
                any other real improvement. They note that per-pupil spending 
                has nearly doubled in real terms between 1970 and 2000, but performance 
                has stayed flat. They also give an extreme example of spending 
                on minorities that led nowhere. In 1985, a federal judge ordered 
                Kansas City to upgrade its schools to attract more white students 
                to the 75-percent-black system, and raise abysmal test scores. 
                Over the next 15 years, the city raised property taxes, and spent 
                $2 billion on schools. Central High School got an Olympic-size 
                pool with six diving boards, a classical Greek theater, an eight-lane 
                indoor track, a gym stocked with professional equipment, a planetarium, 
                a recording studio, and a 100-acre farm. It got a world-class 
                Russian fencing coach, and enough violin teachers to give private 
                lessons to a whole elementary school. All this did no good. In 
                2000, Kansas City schools were no more racially integrated than 
                before, and test scores were as bad as ever (see AR, Dec. 1995, 
                for a detailed account).</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Shaker Heights, a wealthy Cleveland 
                suburb that serves many children of educated black parents, has 
                tried for years to narrow the race gap. It spends 50 percent more 
                money on each student than the national average, but black high 
                school students still lag far behind whites: They are about four 
                times more likely to fail state proficiency tests and less than 
                a tenth as likely to pass those tests with honors. Shaker Heights 
                may have worked harder for equal results than any other school 
                district but still has almost nothing to show for it.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The racial gap starts even before 
                students get to school, so it is hard to blame free-floating school 
                &#147;racism.&#148; Black preschoolers score considerably lower 
                on ability tests than white preschoolers. Differences in social 
                class or parents&rsquo; education do not explain the gap either. 
                Indeed, the performance gap between the children of black and 
                white college-educated parents is even greater than the average 
                black/white gap.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Nor can &#147;racism&#148; explain 
                why Asian students perform as well or better than whites. It is 
                likewise worth noting that, as the graphs on pages three and four 
                show, Hispanics almost invariably outscore blacks, even in reading, 
                despite the fact that immigrants often speak poor English. This 
                is very hard to explain in terms of &#147;racism,&#148; poverty, 
                etc.</font></p>

              <p><font size="3">The failure of the liberal explanation 
                suggests the gap reflects innate racial differences, but conventional 
                &#147;conservatives&#148; like the Thernstroms claim the problem 
                is &#147;cultural.&#148; They blame the misbehavior of minority 
                students, the lack of an atmosphere of learning at home, and minority 
                teachers who promote ethnic separatism. These things probably 
                contribute to the gap, but conservatives refuse to consider the 
                possibility that these things themselves may be innate.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Behavior differences make it hard 
                for blacks to learn. Black kindergartners are less persistent, 
                less eager to learn, and less able to pay attention than white 
                kindergartners, and these differences continue through high school. 
                Blacks are 21/2 times more likely than whites to be suspended 
                from school, and students in high-minority schools are sixteen 
                times more likely to be robbed than students in largely-white 
                schools. One teacher at a heavily non-white school said her job 
                was &#147;nine-tenths policeman, one-tenth educational.&#148;</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Minority households are different 
                from white households. Minority parents spend much less time reading 
                to children or teaching them the alphabet and numbers. Nearly 
                half of black fourth graders spend five or more hours watching 
                television or videos on a typical school day. Fewer than 20 percent 
                of white fourth graders watch that much.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Needless to say, none of these arguments 
                in any way refutes the view that the racial problem is genetic. 
                What the Thernstroms describe is to be expected from low-IQ people 
                who do not plan for the future. The behavior and environment of 
                minorities are not some unfortunate accident that somehow manages 
                to befall them wherever they go. It reflects who they are. The 
                Thernstroms, for example, point out the disadvantages for minority 
                children of the large number of single parents&mdash;as if blacks 
                and Hispanics were just plain unlucky to be having so many illegitimate 
                children.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The Thernstroms&rsquo; research suggests 
                minority students are doubly disadvantaged by the effects of innate 
                racial differences, because minority teachers gravitate towards 
                minority schools. Teachers who do well on tests teach better, 
                and there are large race differences in scores on teaching exams. 
                Although the passing grades are often called &#147;ridiculously 
                low,&#148; serving only to screen out illiterates, more than 30 
                percent of black and Hispanic teachers fail them, as opposed to 
                fewer than 10 percent of whites. Low-IQ minority students have 
                trouble learning; low-IQ teachers have trouble teaching.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Schools often encourage minorities 
                to see themselves as ethnically separate, and stress white racism 
                to encourage feelings of grievance. Some minority schools promote 
                outright black and Hispanic nationalism. This may or may not affect 
                grades, but the Thernstroms are convinced racial nationalism keeps 
                non-whites at the margins of society, and lowers their performance.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">There actually are a few reasons 
                for the race gap that cannot be blamed on racial differences. 
                The National Education Association (NEA), the main teachers&rsquo; 
                union, has made it virtually impossible to fire incompetent teachers, 
                and has opposed accountability programs, charter schools, and 
                school vouchers, all of which tend to improve schools. The burden 
                of the NEA&rsquo;s obstruction to change falls mainly on minority 
                students, who are less able to afford private schools not under 
                the NEA&rsquo;s control. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3"><b>Charter Schools</b></font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Conservatives are enthusiastic about 
                charter schools. Indeed, faith in charter schools is at the foundation 
                of NCLB, which gives districts the option of reopening bad schools 
                as charter schools. The Thernstroms write glowing profiles of 
                several charter schools, and offer evidence that they improve 
                performance. These schools do this by working students extremely 
                hard, instilling respect for authority, and severely punishing 
                misbehavior. They also add many more hours of instruction: For 
                example, the school day at Amistad Academy in New Haven, Connecticut, 
                runs from 7:45 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The school year is two weeks 
                longer than normal, and students can attend summer school.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">But do charter schools close the 
                racial gap? For most of them, the Thernstroms do not give enough 
                test data for a clear answer, but the students at Amistad Academy, 
                which is 66 percent black and 33 Hispanic, scored at about the 
                state average in 2001. This is very good for minorities in a state 
                that is still 78 percent white, and is certainly evidence that 
                intensive teaching improves performance. The crucial question, 
                of course, is how well whites would do in an equally intensive 
                school?</font></p>

              <p><font size="3">Furthermore, the minorities at Amistad 
                Academy and the other charter schools that so impress the Thernstroms 
                are not random samples. The schools do not have admissions tests, 
                but they require a firm commitment to education from students&rsquo; 
                families. Parents must promise to encourage learning at home, 
                and agree to a long school day. Minority parents who go to the 
                trouble to find out about charter schools, talk to school officials, 
                and abide by school rules are not average. Moreover, students 
                who break academy rules are expelled, and this weeds out the worst. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Good results from charter schools 
                are encouraging, but they are not proof&mdash;they are not even 
                very strong evidence&mdash;that the racial gap can be closed. Instead, 
                they suggest that white students are poorly served by public schools, 
                and that if minority students do well in charter schools, whites 
                would probably do even better. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">For years, the evidence has shown 
                that all students benefit from intensive education, but that smart 
                children benefit even more than dull children. The average performance 
                rises, but the gap between the best and worst grows wider. The 
                only way to eliminate the racial gap would be to teach nothing 
                at all and leave our children all equally ignorant. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3"><b>Fraud</b></font></p>
              <p><font size="3">NCLB sets up so many impossible 
                expectations that only liars will prosper. Previous federal and 
                state-level accountability programs have already prompted schools 
                to disguise failure, particularly that of minorities, and NCLB&rsquo;s 
                requirements will only make things worse.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Rod Paige, Secretary of Education, 
                is an instructive example. From 1994 to 2001, he was superintendent 
                of schools in Houston, where high test scores for poor Hispanics 
                and low dropout rates were the envy of the nation. Mr. Paige got 
                his current job on the strength of his supposedly stellar performance, 
                and the accountability program he used to perform these miracles 
                became the model for NCLB.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">It has since become clear that much 
                of the success was a fraud. Robert Kimball, assistant principal 
                at Sharpstown High School in Houston, discovered that although 
                his mostly-Hispanic high school had a freshman class of 1,000 
                that dropped to fewer than 300 by graduation, the school was on 
                record as not having had a single dropout. Nor was this an anomaly. 
                A state audit found there were 2,300 more unreported dropouts 
                in the district. Fourteen schools that had the highest performance 
                rating were busted to the lowest rating on the basis of their 
                actual dropout rates.</font></p>

              <p><font size="3">There were other tricks. In order 
                to improve average scores on the state math test given in the 
                10th grade, many schools held weak 9th graders back a year so 
                that only good students took the exam. After two years in the 
                9th grade, they moved straight to the 11th grade, bypassing the 
                exam. Houston principals cheated because the district gave them 
                bonuses for good reports and fired them for bad ones. As Mr. Kimball 
                noted, &#147;The principals who survive are the yes men.&#148; 
                NCLB encourages the same kind of dishonesty</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Either Mr. Paige knew what was going 
                on and was a fraud, or didn&rsquo;t know and was incompetent. In 
                either case, he is the kind that succeeds under the current racial 
                orthodoxy, and it was his system that was the model for NCLB. 
                For months, Mr. Paige refused to comment on the revelations, and 
                now dismisses them as &#147;inflammatory&#148; and &#147;unfair&#148; 
                attacks by political enemies. He is already claiming great success 
                for NCLB.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Dishonesty has cropped up all over 
                the country in the wake of accountability programs. South Carolina 
                reported 2001 graduation rates of 87 percent; on closer inspection, 
                it turned out to be 57 percent. California claimed a rate of 87 
                percent when it was really 70 percent. Indiana reported a graduation 
                rate of 90 percent that was actually 74 percent.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">One reason for high dropout rates 
                is that schools push out weak students so they can raise test 
                scores and comply with accountability programs. <i>The New York 
                Times</i> recently found that five to ten percent of New York 
                City students are pushed out of school. The same thing happens 
                in Miami. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">When states require accountability, 
                the number of students classified as &#147;learning disabled&#148; 
                suddenly rises&mdash;because they are excused from testing. In 
                North Carolina, the number of students excused from testing more 
                than doubled from four percent to 10 percent after the state set 
                performance requirements.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">NCLB also has penalties for &#147;persistently 
                dangerous&#148; schools, but leaves the definition of &#147;persistently 
                dangerous&#148; up to the states. The result is yet more dishonesty. 
                This year, California reported it had no persistently dangerous 
                schools, although one Los Angeles high school had 289 battery 
                cases, two assaults with a deadly weapon, a robbery, and three 
                sex offenses during 2001-2. School officials are also rumored 
                to be sweeping crime under the carpet.</font></p>
              <div align="left"></div>
              <p><font size="3">The Democratic charge that NCLB 
                is an &#147;unfunded mandate&#148; is also true. Good schools 
                that get an influx of students from bad schools will have to hire 
                new teachers and maybe even build new classrooms, but the law 
                does not now cover these costs. &#147;Failing&#148; schools must 
                hire tutors for poor students, but no one know how much tutoring 
                they will need. These costs come on top of the expense of developing 
                tests and training &#147;highly qualified&#148; teachers. If the 
                government is serious about NCLB, it will have to spend a lot 
                more money.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Also, since the act shifts disproportionate 
                amounts of money to students who are &#147;left behind&#148;&mdash;minorities&mdash;it 
                means failing minorities will cost white taxpayers even more than 
                they do now.</font><font size="3"> </font></p>

                      left behind.</font></b></div>

                </tr>
              </table>
              <p><font size="3">Many states have already cut their 
                meager programs for gifted children so as to shovel money into 
                the gaping maw of NCLB.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Because the new system will make 
                it look as though entire schools&mdash;not just minorities&mdash;are 
                failing, many states will be tempted to design ridiculously simple 
                tests non-whites can pass. They will be free to do this because 
                the definition of &#147;proficiency&#148; is largely up to the 
                states. The result will be a patchwork of different tests, and 
                a child who is proficient in one state will be a failure in another. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Finally, transferring students from 
                failing schools to successful ones means busing inner-city bruisers 
                to white schools. The results are likely to be the same as in 
                the 1960s and 1970s, when busloads of poor blacks threw happy, 
                successful schools into chaos. Under busing, test scores plummeted.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">On the other hand, some good may 
                actually come of this law. The NEA resists even the most obviously 
                needed changes in schools. NCLB gives government officials the 
                power to go over the head of the NEA and dismiss incompetent teachers 
                and principals, and turn failing schools into charter schools. 
                The administration is generally hostile to education fads and 
                multicultural nonsense, so putting more power in its hands may 
                result in some improvement. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Finally, the inevitable failure 
                of NCLB to close the racial gap will be further proof of the intractability 
                of racial differences. The neo-conservatives who smugly tout charter 
                schools and accountability on television will end up failing just 
                as badly as the liberals did. The failure of one more expensive 
                government program to make blacks and Hispanics act like white 
                people will nudge America further towards racial understanding.</font></p>
