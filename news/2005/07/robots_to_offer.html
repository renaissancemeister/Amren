<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8656746/">Robots To Offer Japan&rsquo;s Elderly New Lease On Life</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, July 21</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>TOKYO &mdash; They won&rsquo;t be leaping tall buildings in a single bound, but Japan&rsquo;s growing number of elderly may someday have a new lease on life that allows them to care for themselves &mdash; and maybe even pump a little iron.</p>
<p>As the country&rsquo;s population ages rapidly and its workforce shrinks, care workers may be hard to come by, so researchers are trying to develop the ultimate personal care givers: robots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlike the United States or Europe, Japan is reluctant to allow in cheap foreign laborers,&rdquo; said Takashi Gomi, president of Canada-based Applied AI Systems Inc., whose company has developed a prototype of an &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; wheelchair that can move around on its own and sense obstacles to avoid them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this will change easily in the next 20 to 30 years, so robots are about the only solution,&rdquo; said Gomi, a Canadian researcher born in Japan.</p>
<p>Mechanical helpers</p>
<p>Right now, most robots are used in factories. But many Japanese researchers have begun developing mechanical helpers for use in homes, offices, hospitals and nursing facilities.</p>
<p>Turning to robots makes economic sense.</p>
<p>A government report said in May that annual demand for non-factory &ldquo;service robots&rdquo; may reach 1.1 trillion yen ($9.75 billion) in 2015, when one in four Japanese is expected to be 65 or older.</p>
<p>Yoshiyuki Sankai is among those who see robots as the future of elderly health care.</p>
<p>A researcher at Japan&rsquo;s University of Tsukuba, Sankai has developed a robotic suit designed to make it easier for elderly people with weak muscles to move around or for care-givers to lift them.</p>
<p>The sleek, high-tech get-up looks like a white suit of armor. It straps onto a person&rsquo;s arms, legs and back and is equipped with a computer, motors and sensors that detect electric nerve signals transmitted from the brain when a person tries to move his limbs.</p>
<p>When the sensors detect the nerve signals, the computer starts up the relevant motors to assist the person&rsquo;s motions.</p>
<p>Sankai says the suit, dubbed &ldquo;Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) 5,&rdquo; can let a person who can barely do an 176-pound leg press handle 397 pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big goal is to expand or strengthen the physical capability of humans,&rdquo; said Sankai, who set up a venture firm last year to market the robot suit and plans to start leasing HAL-5 to the elderly and disabled in Japan this year. </p>
