<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>They are two distinct communities, separated mostly by railroad tracks, tucked into the southern and eastern edges of Buffalo&rsquo;s East Side. </p>
<p>But now Lovejoy and Seneca-Babcock have something in common. They&rsquo;ve both experienced ugly incidents with racial overtones in the last two weeks. </p>
<p>Although predominantly white, the communities are different in some respects. </p>
<p>Seneca-Babcock, just north of both the Niagara Thruway and South Buffalo, is the more depressed area, with significantly more residents living below the poverty level. Its residents tend to be Irish. </p>
<p>To the northeast, Lovejoy, on the Sloan border, has Polish, German and Italian roots. </p>
<p>Lovejoy clearly has been slower to integrate. As recently as 2000, Seneca-Babcock had a 7 percent minority presence, Lovejoy only 1 percent. </p>
<p>But they also share some similarities that run deep. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Those have been known in their earlier days as racist areas for African-Americans to move in, but African-Americans have moved into both,&rdquo; said the Rev. Kenyatta T. Cobb, pastor of Hananiah Lutheran Church on Sycamore Street. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve developed very strong mixed-ethnic relationships in those communities. </p>
<p>Cobb and others cited a small core group of individuals who have put out a &ldquo;Not Welcome&rdquo; sign in each community. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;When African-Americans historically have moved into these neighborhoods, this started to trigger, on one level, outward migration of whites and, on another level, increasing levels of tension,&rdquo; said Henry L. Taylor Jr., director of the University at Buffalo&rsquo;s Center for Urban Studies. </p>
<p>Taylor also suggested that, on seeing a growing number of black neighbors, some white residents may ask: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going to start to look like parts of the East Side?&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovejoy is Italian and Polish, and some people want to keep it that way,&rdquo; said James Frost, a Lovejoy resident for about six years. &ldquo;All that violence on the East Side, we don&rsquo;t want that here, so I look at it as some of the younger kids are just trying to protect the neighborhood.&rdquo; </p>
<p>• And, in both communities, there&rsquo;s concern over outsiders selling drugs on street corners. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The kids have told me there are drug dealers driving through in their Escalades, selling heroin and crack,&rdquo; said Lovejoy Council Member Richard A. Fontana, who represents both areas. &ldquo;The kids in the neighborhood are seeing this, and they&rsquo;re concerned about illegal activity invading their neighborhood.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hastreiter said she is &ldquo;seriously bothered&rdquo; by Friday night&rsquo;s stabbings. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They can call it racial, they can call it whatever they want, but it&rsquo;s not right for people to come in here and ruin our quality of life,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>Some residents believe that&rsquo;s what happened Friday night. </p>
<p>In that incident, five black teens, most of whom had been staying with a white family on East Lovejoy Street, roamed the neighborhood shouting anti-white statements. During a fight with four young white men, police said, two blacks stabbed three whites, seriously wounding two. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The Seneca-Babcock neighborhood, the entire square mile of it, has all the ingredients for simmering racial tensions: </p>
<p>A high unemployment rate, roughly 25 percent. An increasing minority presence that in recent years has grown from 3 percent to more than 10. Youths who spray-paint swastikas and racial slurs. An apparent battle over outsiders coming in to sell drugs on street corners. </p>
<p>Two recent events ignited those combustible ingredients: the beating of an African-American man by five young white people and a rally against racism staged by outsiders. </p>
<p>Whatever its problems, Seneca-Babcock now has another one: a battle over whether it is a racist neighborhood. The two sides in this war of words see little gray. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not a racial problem in Seneca-Babcock,&rdquo; said Art Robinson, president of the local block club. &ldquo;We have had African-Americans living in Seneca-Babcock for over 50 years. We&rsquo;ve always embraced them as part of the neighborhood.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Beverly Hiestand, a spokeswoman for the International Action Center group that rallied against racism, has a different view. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s extreme racism,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely prevalent, and it&rsquo;s not hidden. If they&rsquo;re saying they don&rsquo;t have a problem, they&rsquo;re part of the problem.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Robinson, the block club president, contends outsiders &mdash; who come in dealing heroin, crack cocaine and other drugs &mdash; are fueling the tensions. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening is more of a gang thing, more of a drug war,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The outsiders are intimidating other people. They want to take over the turf. This is a turf war.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Sister Margaret O&rsquo;Donnell, a member of the Sisters of Mercy who grew up in the neighborhood and still has relatives there, attended last week&rsquo;s rally against racism. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I went there to rally against any kind of racism,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I believe there are racial tensions there because of the guns and drugs that people in the neighborhood are anxious about. They want to get the drugs and guns out.&rdquo; </p>
