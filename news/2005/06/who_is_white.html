<p><font size="3">            <p>Everyone 
              has by now seen the pictures of the September 11 terrorists. They 
              were all swarthy, black-haired Middle Eastern-looking men in their 
              20s and 30s. Despite this, the FAA refuses to single out such people 
              at airports for special scrutiny. In a letter published in the <i>Wall 
              Street Journal</i> on October 31, 2001, an irate reader asked why 
              airport security guards had hand-searched the purse and carry-on 
              bag of his friend, a 45-year-old white woman. If the FAA would only 
              study the FBI photos of the terrorists, he wrote, they would see 
              &#147;there are no Girl Scouts, no grandmothers, indeed no women. 
              Nor are there any black American men, Hispanic American men, or 
              white American men. They are all obviously Middle Eastern young 
              men.&#148; </font></p>

            <p>This writer makes the mistake of 
              assuming that what is obvious to the average citizen is obvious 
              to the U.S. government. Evidently, he is unaware that his government 
              officially classifies all Middle Eastern people (Arabic, Turkic, 
              Iranian, or Afghan) as white. In other words, according to our government, 
              the terrorists were the same racial and ethnic stock as European 
              Americans. This is part of a government policy of defining whiteness 
              in a way that inflates the number of whites in America and obscures 
              the extent of demographic change.</font></p>
            <p>Many of the criteria by which the 
              U.S. Bureau of the Census defined race for the 2000 census are confusing 
              and suspect. Question 6 on the census form&mdash;directed to the 
              census taker rather than the person being counted&mdash;asks: &#147;What 
              is this person&rsquo;s race? Mark one or more races to indicate what 
              this person considers himself/herself to be.&#148; The census taker 
              does not draw his own conclusions but instead records what he is 
              told. </font></p>

            <p>There is a box for White, one for 
              Black, one for American Indian or Alaska Native, six boxes for various 
              kinds of Asians (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, 
              Vietnamese), plus a box for &#147;Other Asian,&#148; which requires 
              a written entry. There are three boxes for Native Hawaiians and 
              Pacific Islanders (Native Hawaiian, Guamanian or Chamorro, Samoan) 
              and one box for &#147;Other Pacific Islander,&#148; which also requires 
              a written entry. The bureau classifies all who checked one of the 
              four Pacific Islander boxes as &#147;Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific 
              Islander,&#148; and all who checked any of the seven Asian boxes 
              as &#147;Asian.&#148; For the latest census, the bureau created 
              a seventh category for people who chose more than one box: &#147;Two 
              or More Races.&#148; The bureau then put every resident into one 
              of the seven categories, as shown in the table on this page. </font></p>
            <p>These categories raise many questions. 
              For example, why do Pacific Islanders&mdash;just 0.1 percent of the 
              population&mdash;get their own racial category rather than be grouped 
              with other Asians? Why are Indians from India grouped with East 
              Asians when they are obviously a different racial type from Chinese 
              and Japanese? The most obvious question is: Where are the Hispanics? 
              </font></p>
            <p>Part of the answer to the last question 
              is that 14.9 million of them are &#147;Some Other Race&#148; (fully 
              97 percent of that category). According to the government, &#147;Hispanics 
              may be of any race,&#148; and &#147;race and Hispanic origin [are] 
              two separate and distinct concepts.&#148; Therefore, question 5 
              on the census form asks, &#147;Is this person Spanish/Hispanic/Latino?&#148; 
              The answer can be either yes or no. Anyone who says yes is asked 
              whether he is Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or &#147;Other Hispanic.&#148; 
              Hispanics can then choose their own race, with the results in the 
              table on this page. The ones who end up in the &#147;Some Other 
              Race&#148; category are those who do not consider themselves white, 
              black, Indian or Asian. They might have written in &#147;Cuban&#148; 
              or &#147;Mexican,&#148; but the census bureau cannot, on that basis, 
              call them white, brown or black, so they are &#147;other.&#148;</font></p>

            <p>Note that almost half of all American 
              Hispanics say they are white. While some&mdash;those of pure Spanish 
              descent or South Americans of German or Italian stock&mdash;are undoubtedly 
              white, are we to believe that half of all Hispanics living here 
              are white? No one who has lived in or visited an area in which there 
              are many Hispanics can believe that.</font></p>
            <p>Why did so many make this choice? 
              Partly, it is because the Census Bureau doesn&rsquo;t offer realistic 
              choices. A Mexican peasant is not likely to think of himself as 
              black, Asian or American Indian (although many really are more Amerindian 
              than anything else). At the same time, centuries of interracial 
              mixing in Latin America plus the continuing prestige of whiteness 
              (despite much anti-white propaganda) has led to a very broad definition 
              of whiteness in Hispanic culture. These 2000 census results are 
              remarkably similar to those of the 1996 Brazilian census, which 
              reported that 52 percent of Brazilians think they are white.<sup>1</sup></font> 
            <p>Although many Hispanics are Mestizo 
              mixtures, only six percent say they are &#147;two or more races.&#148; 
              Only two percent say they are black. Clearly, just as in Brazil, 
              many Hispanics put themselves in the desirable &#147;white&#148; 
              category, but since the bureau says &#147;Hispanic&#148; is not 
              a racial category, they can do this without compromising their legally 
              privileged standing in American law.</font></p>

            <p>The census bureau takes the equally 
              implausible view that the brown peoples of North Africa, the Middle 
              East, and Southwest Asia are all white, too. It says the white category 
              is for &#147;people having origins in any of the original peoples 
              of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people 
              who indicated their race or races as &lsquo;White&rsquo; or wrote 
              in entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, <i>Near Easterner</i>, 
              <i>Arab</i>, or Polish&#148; (italics mine). The government also 
              considers people of Turkic, Iranian, and Afghan origin to be white. 
              Pakistanis, on the other hand, are Asian. Thus, according to the 
              U.S. government the frontiers of the white world extend up to Pakistan 
              and black Africa.</font></p>
            <p>As it does with Hispanics, the census 
              bureau lets Middle Easterners choose their own race from among the 
              four options of White, Black, &#147;Some Other Race,&#148; or a 
              combination of these three. If they choose the white box, the bureau 
              calls them white, no questions asked. If they choose the black box, 
              the bureau calls them black. On the other hand, if a Middle Easterner 
              chooses &#147;Some Other Race&#148; (which requires a written entry 
              to explain what the race is) either by itself or in combination 
              with White or Black, the bureau calls that person white. In other 
              words, if an Egyptian checks Black and &#147;Some Other Race&#148; 
              (writing in Egyptian), he is white. If an Iranian checks White and 
              &#147;some other race&#148; (writing in Iranian or Persian), he 
              is also white. If any Middle Easterner, North African, or Southwest 
              Asian checks only &#147;Some Other Race&#148; (writing in his nationality) 
              he is called white. A Middle-Easterner, say an Iranian, could call 
              himself &#147;Other Asian&#148; and write in &#147;Iranian;&#148; 
              the census bureau would still say he was white.</font></p>

            <p>Thus, despite the census bureau&rsquo;s 
              claim that race is a matter of &#147;self-identification,&#148; 
              it calls a lot of brown people white, even though they clearly think 
              they are not. And given that the census bureau took the trouble 
              to distinguish between Guamanians and Samoans, and break down the 
              Asian category into various groups, why didn&rsquo;t it establish 
              a category for Middle Eastern peoples?</font></p>
            <p>Calling brown people white is so absurd 
              that even journalists, not known for questioning government statistics, 
              have wondered about it. The census bureau has so far offered no 
              plausible explanation. In the early 1990s, at least one Arab organization 
              formally proposed that the government establish a separate racial 
              category for Middle Easterners and North Africans, but nothing happened.</font><sup>2</sup></font> 
              Jorge Del Pinal of the census bureau recently explained that the 
              bureau &#147;couldn&rsquo;t get a handle on it.&#148; He said the 
              racial, religious, and language diversity of the area is so great 
              the bureau gave up and decided to call everyone white.</font><sup>3</sup></font></p>
            <p>This is not believable. Perhaps 
              the government is deliberately inflating the number of whites in 
              the hope of calming fears of white dispossession. Another possibility 
              is hesitation to establish a non-white, &#147;Middle Eastern&#148; 
              category that would logically have included at least some Jews, 
              and would raise the question of whether Jews are white. Or perhaps 
              our rulers think that by diluting the definition of whiteness they 
              can prevent the rise of white racial consciousness and solidarity. 
              </font></p>
            <p> Another fishy census category is 
              &#147;white alone or in combination,&#148; which includes whites 
              plus people who are part-white (those who chose one or more other 
              racial boxes as well as white). Reportedly 6.8 million Americans 
              said they belonged to two or more races. Of these, 74.1 percent 
              said they were white and just one other race, and another six percent 
              said they were white and more than one other race. Some people add 
              these hybrids to the &#147;white&#148; population, thereby inflating 
              the number of &#147;whites&#148; to 217 million.</font></p>
            <p>Government officials, politicians, 
              journalists, and ethnic lobbyists can use these various definitions 
              of whiteness not only to misrepresent the actual number of whites 
              in the United States but to cite different figures to suit particular 
              purposes. For example, a recent article in the <i>Christian Science 
              Monitor</i> minimized white dispossession by assuring readers that 
              &#147;if large numbers of them [Hispanics] identify themselves as 
              white, then white society will predominate in the US (albeit with 
              a Latino flavor) for decades to come,&#148; and &#147;throw in the 
              5.5 million people who describe themselves as white as well as one 
              or more other races, and the [white] share climbs to 77.1 of the 
              US population&mdash;a higher proportion than existed in 1830.&#148; 
              This reporter also noted (without indicating which definition of 
              white he was using) that whites, at 63 percent, were still a majority 
              in California.</font><sup>4</sup></font> That figure 
              includes both &#147;white&#148; Hispanics and mixed race &#147;whites.&#148; 
              A more correct figure for whites in California in 2001 was 48 percent, 
              as was noted by more honest reporters.</font><sup>5</sup></font></p>
            <p>Census statistics and permeable 
              definitions of whiteness make it easy to minimize or maximize the 
              demographic transformation to suit any purpose. By including Middle 
              Easterners, &#147;white&#148; Hispanics, and &#147;whites alone 
              or in combination,&#148; immigration enthusiasts can claim that 
              nearly 80 percent of the country is still white! At the same time, 
              when Hispanic lobbyists want to exercise power they can point to 
              their growing numbers: 35 million people who are 12.5 percent of 
              the population. Finally, by inflating the number of whites, the 
              government can maintain the fiction of a white majority long after 
              it has ceased to exist, and thus continue to use the majority/minority 
              terminology that undergirds the racial spoils system that benefits 
              non-whites.</font></p>
            <div align="left"></div>
            <p>How many whites are there in the 
              country? It takes considerable hunting through census publications 
              to find figures for what the bureau calls &#147;non-Hispanic Whites:&#148; 
              194.5 million, or 69 percent of the total. How many of these are 
              Middle Eastern? There are no official census bureau figures for 
              them, but the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee estimates 
              there are three to four million Arab-Americans. My own conservative 
              estimate of the number of people of Turkic, Armenian, Afghan, and 
              Iranian ancestry (based on 2000 census ancestry reporting as well 
              as immigration figures for these groups since 1965) is three million. 
              Adding the low-end estimate of the Arab population (three million) 
              to this Southwest Asian estimate results in six million. Subtracting 
              that number from the non-Hispanic white base of 194.5 leaves 188.5 
              million European-Americans, or 67 percent of the US population. 
              This figure still includes the doubtful 17 million or so Hispanics 
              who claim to be white. Ten more years of massive non-white immigration 
              will surely drop even this exaggerated white percentage below 60 
              percent by 2010 and, if immigration continues, to below 50 percent 
              by 2025, a full 25 years before the census bureau predicts whites 
              will become a minority. </font></p>

              2000 figures for whites, depending on the definition used.</font></p>

            <p>What is to be done about these shifting 
              definitions? The first order of business is to educate the shrinking 
              white majority about the census bureau&rsquo;s confusing racial categories. 
              We should pressure Congress to change its classifications. In particular, 
              we need a category for North African, Middle Eastern, and Southwest 
              Asian peoples. Even Arab-Americans want their own racial category 
              (though this is partly because they want to benefit from racial 
              preferences, from which they are now, at least officially, excluded). 
              The events of September 11th make this an especially good time to 
              push for such a change.</font></p>
            <p>I would also suggest revamping the 
              racial categories to make them far more complete and accurate. My 
              proposal, outlined in the accompanying table, makes an important 
              distinction between primary and secondary racial identities. Everyone 
              would choose one primary and one secondary category, and no more. 
              This system would also distinguish between people who are Spanish 
              (and hence European) and those who are Hispanic (all or partly non-white). 
              If the government is going to collect information on race, it should 
              illuminate what is happening in our country rather than obscure 
              it.</font></p>

  <font size="3"><p>Whoa, wait just a minute here!</p>
<p>&#8220;How many whites are there in the country? It takes considerable hunting through census publications to find figures for what the bureau calls &ldquo;non-Hispanic Whites:&rdquo; 194.5 million, or 69 percent of the total. How many of these are Middle Eastern? There are no official census bureau figures for them, but the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee estimates there are three to four million Arab-Americans. My own conservative estimate of the number of people of Turkic, Armenian, Afghan, and Iranian ancestry (based on 2000 census ancestry reporting as well<br>
as immigration figures for these groups since 1965) is three million. Adding the low-end estimate of the Arab population (three million) to this Southwest Asian estimate results in six million. Subtracting that number from the non-Hispanic white base of 194.5 leaves 188.5 million European-Americans, or 67 percent of the US population. This figure still includes the doubtful 17 million or so Hispanics who claim to be white.&#8221;<br><br>
<span class="caps">STOP</span>!! You already subtracted the whites by only counting &#8220;non-Hispanic whites&#8221;. Don&rsquo;t subtract them twice! Let&rsquo;s be more accurate here!</p>
<p>16.9 million Hispanics call themselves white. If we assume that one-quarter of them, or 4.2 million, actually are white, then we add them <span class="caps">BACK</span> IN to the white population, to give us 192.7 million.</p>
<p>In other words, if we subtract Arabs and Muslims from the non-Hispanic white population, we should be able to add approximately the same number of white Hispanics back in so the &#8220;non-Hispanic white&#8221; population gives us a roughly accurate figure as to the real European population in this country.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I work for the Census Bureau as a field rep.  I collect this data.</p>
<p>This article is dated.  Since this article was written, we&rsquo;ve switched how we record race and ethnicity.  The race questions are now asked as follows:</p>
<p>Question 1:  Are you Spanish, Hispanic or Latino?  If yes, then it asks which specific group(s) (eg Cuban, Mexican, Puerto rican).</p>
<p>Question 2: please choose one or more races you consider yourself to be:  White, black, American indian, Asian, Native hawaiian or other pacific islander, other.</p>
<p>If Asian or pacific islander is reported, it asks what specific group(s) (eg Fillipino, Korean, Hawaiian, samoan, etc.)</p>
<p>If Other is reported, a huge menu of 38 different ethnicities/races is listed.  (eg Samoan, arab, Brazilian, Creole, Latino, Mexican).  And finally there is an &#8220;other&#8221; catagory within the broader &#8220;other&#8221; race catagory. </p>
<p>These changes were made to address the problem highlighted by the article above.  That is, people being lumped into broad catagories that commonsense would say they do not belong.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Dr. Trask is to be commended for undertaking this difficult and frustrating topic. I have long held that US Census data is primarily used to abuse and confuse, our shrinking real white population through absurdly constructed and intentionally nebulas categories. Clearly, at best whites really make up only about 68% to 64% of our population here in the <span class="caps">USA. </span></p>
<p>In general, I agree with his racial classification system; however, some questions do arise. I, Myself for example, would clearly be classified as white. My known ancestry is both fully Primary and Secondary white, by Dr. Trask&rsquo;s system; my known ancestry is as follows: Ukrainian, Russian, Irish, Scotch, French, German, and English in about that order. Thus, by this system I would most likely be classified as primary white, and secondary Slavic. The reason for this being that I am logically 50% Slavic, about 40% Nordic, and approximately 10% Mediterranean? </p>
<p>Now comes the tricky part, I am declaring myself white/Slavic based on the idea that I am roughly 10% Mediterranean on one side of my family because they have about 20% to 25% French mixed into a known ancestry that is primarily Irish and Scotch (50% minimum) and German and English (logically 25% to 30%,) while the other side is fully Slavic? Here is where I am going to nitpick, just a bit; Dr. Trask clearly states: &ldquo;Everyone would choose one primary and one secondary category, and no more.&rdquo; The reason for this being, that I might just be more honestly described as white/Nordic, rather than white/Slavic?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, on the side of my family that holds to be mostly Irish and Scotch, the &ldquo;French&rdquo; contribution is known to have come from the Alsace-Lorraine area near the boarder with Germany and had a rather German sounding &ldquo;French&rdquo; last name (Burgen or Burgoine?) Also, it is known that they first settled in Canada as farmers and might have intermarried with Scandinavians, prior to whatever part of this line of my family, did eventually branch down into the <span class="caps">USA</span>? </p>
<p>Next, the side of the family that is Slavic, questions exactly what their full ethnic make up is as well. First, the side that is &ldquo;Ukrainian&rdquo; is not sure that there is not some German or Russian in the family because of the region they come from (the Black Sea,) their land holdings which were considerable (aristocrats or Kulaks?,) and their family name (Gernenway or Gergenvey?) </p>
<p>Second, the side that is &ldquo;Russian&rdquo; hails from Minsk (located in present day Belarus) and held several mining operations in Siberia. Thus, it is possible they might have been Byelorussians or White Russians and not Russians?  </p>
<p>In the end such questions will never be answered fully, since both of my grandparents&rsquo; families on this side my family, fled the Russian Empire when they were between the ages of 6 to 8, during the Red Revolution? Not the best oral historians!</p>
<p>The point to all of this being, that culturally I consider myself  to be an American Anglo-Saxon, or in other words an &ldquo;acceptably assimilated&rdquo; white American; I really do not have any other identity. Yes, I love potato pancakes, Bratwurst, and Borsch but other than that, I am hardly an &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; white-American in my book! Thus, am I really a white/Slavic or a white/Nordic, when all of the possibilities are considered?</p>
<p>Just Something To Think About!</p>

  <font size="3"><p>It&rsquo;s clear where they&rsquo;re going with this newly invented negative term &#8220;non-Hispanic White&#8221; they&rsquo;ve come up with for the European ancestried and the flooding of the country with people from South of the border.    One day, after years of (and God forbid!) multicult promoted mixing they&rsquo;ll simply let go of the term &#8220;non-Hispanic White&#8221; and declare everyone Hispanic in this category, whether or not everyone in the category is actually &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; or not&hellip;.the problem of &#8220;race&#8221; will then have been &#8220;resolved&#8221; in the multi-cultists dysfunctional thinking.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>I&rsquo;ve always found the question are Jews white somewhat amusing.  All I have to do is look in the mirror to find the answer to that one.<br>
And what do I see?  A face with blue eyes, fair skin, and straight hair looking back at me.  My mother had blond hair and blue eyes; my three sisters have blue eyes, as well.<br><br>
I cannot recall a single time in my life when anyone <span class="caps">EVER </span>thought I was Jewish judging by my appearance alone.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I have been mistaken for Italian or some other European nationality.  And recently at an all Irish bar a man with a thick brogue asked me whether or not I was a fellow Celt.  <br><br>
I have always felt myself to be nothing other than white.  My consciousness is white; I identify with things white.  I prefer to be white, and I am proud to be white.  For there is no doubt that the white race is responsible for almost all of the greatest achievements of the human race   &mdash;   and Jews have played no small part in those achievements.<br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>As I have learned living in Miami color is not a completely reliable indicator of degree of civilization. We have many very civilized hispanics here, and an equally large number of blue eyed/blond hispanics who are not particularly civilized. We have very civilized blacks and uncivilized blacks. The same is true for whites.</p>
<p>There seems to be a greater correlation with parent country civilization. Argentine children do exceptionally well in school. Cuba was not a really civilized place before Castro and many white Cubans here are not particularly civilized.</p>
<p>Overall the Miami miracle is really the Miami disaster. The waves of immigrants and illegals have brought their parent cultures with them. Schools are failing. Our commumity hospital is failing financially. The business of Miami has become stacking rocks (construction) and growth. Even though it is predominantly white it is dominated by third world culture. Crime rates are very close to Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington <span class="caps">D.C.</span></p>
<p>We probably need metrics other than race. Especially in schools.<br>
I remember when we classified by performance. And potential by <span class="caps">IQ.</span> Not a bad system. It has produced much.</p>
<p>So here in Miami I treasure my civilized friends and fear the savages. And, color is not too reliable of a discriminator. </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Determining who is white and who isn&rsquo;t is a tough task. We all know that an Oriental looking person or an African looking one are not white but what about many Southern Europeans or even Arabs. I have known blonde, green eyed Palestinians. Are they white? I also went to school with several Eurasian kids who looked white but had Japanese mothers. Are they white? </p>
<p>Ask 100 white people who is white and you&rsquo;ll get 100 differnet definitions. I&rsquo;m a big basketball fan so I&rsquo;ll use some of the players as examples. We can all agree that Dirk Nowitzki  <a href="/us-yimg-com/i/us/sp/v/nba/players/4/3252.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/sp/v/nba/players/4/3252.jpg</a>  and Keith Van Horn are white  <a href="/us-yimg-com/i/us/sp/v/nba/players/4/3169.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/sp/v/nba/players/4/3169.jpg</a>  but what about Manu Ginobili, and Italian from Argentina  <a href="http://us.news1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20050617/thumb.dtp10606171843.nba_finals_dtp106.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://us.news1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20050617/thumb.dtp10606171843.nba_finals_dtp106.jpg</a> or the two Serbs, Vlade Divac and Peja Stojakovic  <a href="/us-yimg-com/i/us/sp/v/nba/players/4/84.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/sp/v/nba/players/4/84.jpg</a>  <a href="/us-yimg-com/i/us/sp/v/nba/players/4/3119.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/sp/v/nba/players/4/3119.jpg</a> it would be a stretch to call them white, at least for me. In my own family of whites we have people who look like the Serbs above and others who are blonde. It&rsquo;s a tough question and we need to come of with a universal definition of whiteness.</p>

<p>I would place real Iranians in the &#8220;white&#8221; category. They are certainly more white then, say, Sicilians- who are a mixture of every passing invasion force in the history of the Mediterranean Sea. The Iranian peoples speak an Indo-European language. It is the area that the Hittites swept into Mesopotamia from (&#8220;iron&#8221; means Aryan) and was also the avenue of a Celtic tribe which aligned itself with and was the ally of the Akkadians and fought along side them in the unification of Mesopotamia.  I believe that route was a well known, well used route by ancient Europeans. It&rsquo;s the reason King Tut looks the way he does in the reconstruction.</p>
<p>They invented the wheel, the cart and tamed the horse. They invented bronze and later iron. They had the mobility that no one else had. They had a wanderlust that no one else had- think about it. Without modern technology developed by Europeans, the Chinese, Africans, etc. would all still be living in their places of origin. The only group who ever moved about freely crossing continents were whites. Now we are trying to traverse the heavens. We are trying to go back home.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>To the commentor who said that he is jewish and white.<br>
It is certainly true that many european jews are white in appearance and would reasonable be considered white in any rational census.<br><br>
What troubled me was your comment about the many accomplishments of jews.  Jewish accomplishments in science and the arts are truely amazing.  For such a small segment of the population, their contributions are truely amazing.  There is one contribution of jewish activists which is seldom mentioned but is of critical significance when we consider the dissolution of the United States.  What I am referring to is the concerted effort made by many jewish organizations to promote a multiethnic culture by changing the immigration laws of the country, specificially the 1965 immigration reform act.  This was an act of congress which passed with very strong institutional jewish support and has sown the seeds of the destruction of america as a gentile nation.<br><br>
When future historians look back on the decline and fall of america, the push to change the country&rsquo;s demographic composition through immigration reform will stand out as a crucial turning point.  Prior US immigration law had sought to maintain the ethnic composition of the country as it has been at the beginning of the 20th century.  That project was destroyed by the immigration reform movement, a movement largely lead by jewish americans.  It is one thiing I would not be proud of if I were jewish.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>When future historians look back on the decline and fall of america, the push to change the country&rsquo;s demographic composition through immigration reform will stand out as a crucial turning point. Prior US immigration law had sought to maintain the ethnic composition of the country as it has been at the beginning of the 20th century. That project was destroyed by the immigration reform movement, a movement largely lead by jewish americans. It is one thiing I would not be proud of if I were jewish.</p>
<p>Posted by Aristotle at 7:40 PM on June 18 </p>
<p>That is an unfortunate comment.<br>
First, when you suggest that the immigration reform movement (presumeably you mean the movement advocating loosening immigration laws as oppossed to the immigration movement diametrically opposed to that) is a Jewish construct, the only conclusion one can draw about Jews then are that they are a nefarious, monolithic entity. To suggest that all Jews are this, that, or the other thing is the worst kind of stereotyping.  We are as diverse a group as your Brits, Frenchmen, or the Whathaveyou people.  <br><br>
Second, and yes I&rsquo;m going to say it.  That to suggest that the Jews will ultimately be responsible for the downfall of America is no different than a short little painter with a funny mustache who said the Children of Abraham were responsible for the Versailles Treaty and the woefull, emasculated state of Gremany in the 1930s.  This has been the eternal wail of the  eternal Jew-hater, theeternal anti-Semetic canard, &#8220;the Jews are our misfortune.&#8221;<br><br>
Third, the American Immigration Nightmare is the bastard child of the liberal/left, multiculture-for-lunch bunch. Some of whom may indeed be Jewish, but the vast majority are most definitely not.  Among them are misguided left wing Christians, America-hating college leftists, Arabs Muslim and otherwise, Indians, Cuban-Haitian-Carribeans, and Asians of all stripes. Chief among them are Hispanics, who are the now the largest non white group in the <span class="caps">USA.</span><br><br>
Fourth, one hears mostly of Jewish liberals because they generally are more affluent and influencial.  But make no misatake about it, there is a significant and growning number of right wing and conservative Jews in America today; perhpas they are even the majority.  And they, we, have always been here.  We just don&rsquo;t have the financial vocal cords to make enough noise with.<br><br>
Those Jews who were your Kennedy-Johnson-Carter Democrats misguidedly welcomed blacks into their neighborhoods deluding themselves into thinking that they had something in common with people of a foreign temperment and mein notwithswtanding the fact that they, the blacks, were American born.  <br><br>
Then came the horror.<br><br>
One by one in city after city they watchecd their clean, safe peacfull, law abiding, quintessentially American neighboroods become filthy, crime ridden dung heaps infected by the black plague of robberies, assaults, rapes, burglaries, shootings, stabbings, murders, and so on and so on.  They hated Hymie as much as they hated Honky.<br><br>
In short they watched in heartbereaking disillusionment as the  same plague of non white aliens both native and foregn born that alarms all of America was infecting the Jewish part of it as well. <br><br>
So kindly do not suggest that Jews are a mental, social, or political monolith.  Kindly do not suggest that Jews are responsible for the American Immigration Nightmare.  It just isn&rsquo;t true.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The whole &#8220;nordic&#8221; thing is ridiculously flawed and needs to go. In reality, true ethnic Russians are much, much, much more &#8220;nordic&#8221; in physical appearance than English(&#8220;Anglo-Saxon) people.  </p>
<p>Many Arabs in US are able to pass for white.  The majority of Arabs in the <span class="caps">US, </span>until recently at least, were Christians from Lebanon and Syria.  These people, along with Jews, although from Southwest Asia, are fairly similar to Europeans phenotypically.  The Muslim Semites are on average much darker and less caucasian looking.  This may be due to admixture with black slaves and remnant Dravadian type peoples.  </p>
<p>You probably notice from all the news from Iraq that Kurds on average are whiter looking than Sunni Arabs, who are in turn whiter looking than Shiite Arabs.  And again within these groups those with higher status such as Ahmed Chalabi and Al-Sadr among the Shiites, are much whiter looking than the average Shiite in the Street.  <br>

  <font size="3"><p>I agree that the Census Bureau&rsquo;s agenda is to confuse and obfuscate. First of all the term &#8220;Latino&#8221; or &#8220;Latin&#8221; is misused constantly. A Latino is anyone who is of or descended from the original ethnicity of a country whose language evolved from Latin.  That would include Italy, Spain, Portugal, France and Rumania. The silent screen matinee idol Rudolf Valentino whose real name was Rudolfo Guglielmi ( Italian) was referred to as a &#8220;Latin Lover&#8221;.<br>
Hispanics are those who are natives of a country or are descended from natives of a country whose official language is Spanish. Therefore people of Mexico, Central America,  or Spanish speaking countries of South America or the Carribean are Hispanic while Brazilians, Guayanians, Haitians, Jamaicans and those of the Lesser Antillies generally are not Hispanics. These categories have become blurred by the integrations of populations within  the above mentioned areas. In the final analysis who gives a rat&rsquo;s cloaca? I guess we could say that &#8220;Latino&#8221; is an ethnic designation while &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is linguistic. Ex- President Fujimori of Peru could be considered Hispanic but not Latino whereas Vicente Fox would be a Celtic/ Latino and Hispanic. <br><br>
Moving along to the Middle East,are all those people who speak Arabic really Arabs?  Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia looks like a black guy to me but is he still an Arab? <br><br>
Ya know while we are pondering all this crap we are being inundated by the Third World.  Honey bring me another Martini please!!!<br><br>

  <font size="3"><p><i><br>
Who looks white, Hosni Mubarak, Anwar Sadat, Osama Bin Laden, Yasser Arafat or Ariel Sharon?<br><br>
</i><br><br>
<br><br><br>
None of them look white. Not really close. Perhaps you&rsquo;re trying to claim Sharon as relatively white? Yes, like heavyweight Mohammed Ali is white compared to his brethren in Africa. <br><br>
<p><br>
The Irishmen at the bar who asked whether you were a Celt was drunk as hell. Or perhaps one of your parents was a white gentile. Otherwise the Middle Eastern genes in the average Jewish person are apparent. <br><br>
<p><br>
Regardless of skin tone, the facial features are different. Larry King, Barbra Streisand, Paula Zahn, Jerry Seinfeld, John Stewart etc. Honestly, do they appear English? Irish? Danish? Swedish? German? Dutch? If your answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;, it&rsquo;s because of minorities becoming the norm in those countries. <br><br>
<p><br>
The fact is that our <span class="caps">U.S. </span>concept of &#8220;white&#8221; is significantly more Mediterranean than a place like Norway, Scotland, or Russia. This is because of the Great Migration from Eastern and Southern Europe after 1900. Anyway in regards to the aforementioned celebs: behind closed doors one can assume they are proudly Jewish, as in the Jewish race, the Jewish People.<br><br>
<p><br>
In this fashion they can have it both ways. They are white to the general public and to the government&hellip;but Jewish to themselves. The intense discrimination toward converted Jews by ethnic Jews is well-documented. They are after all, a &#8220;tribe&#8221; whose membership as far as Israeli religious authorities are concerned is strictly based on maternal blood-lines and not devotion to the faith. <br><br>
<p><br>
Also, it is non-scientific to classify Jews as &#8220;white&#8221; when they are uniquely susceptible to various diseases that do not afflict whites as a group and they are also genetically nearly indistinguishable from Arabs. The Jews migrated into Europe from the Middle East a very short time ago in evolutionary terms. They hardly share the same ancient bloodlines of Europeans unless from miscenegation. But the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>government classifies Jews and many other Arabs, Persians, North Africans and Indians as whites <span class="caps">BECAUSE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT</span> IS <span class="caps">FOR SALE.</span></p></p></p></p></p></p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The amount of labor that Mr. Trask put into the development of this racial identification model is testament to the social construction of race. If race was clearly evident in nature we certainly would need such a complex instrument.  A large part of all of your anguish is the reality that race and ethnicity can not be as neatly categorized objectively as it can when it roles off your lips. I hope this is not an example of doctoral level research because there are serious problems with the theory as well as the application. First I&rsquo;ll start with the positives. This instrument presents more categories that individuals can choose from, and as a result the data collected by such a model would be much more specific if there weren&rsquo;t some many potential problems with the application. The theoretical problems directly impact the potential problems with application so rather than a theoretical debate I will just list some of the most egregious of the latter.  </p>
<p>•	The term Hispanic is confused as a racial group when in fact it is a linguistic group of people who have dissimilar origins. Individuals of Indian origin more commonly self identify as Latino. <br>
•	A significant portion of Hispanics of white origin may not think to check their appropriate category because the word &ldquo;Mediterranean&rdquo; leads their category. <br><br>
•	Hispanics of less recognized racial groups have been totally excluded when other members of the linguist group have been included. <br><br>
•	Amerindians are duplicated, lots of room for miscoding and mistakes in analysis.<br><br>
•	East Indians would be better placed under the Asian category since they are from Asia.  I am not sure if E. Indians identify themselves as Middle Eastern. <br><br>
•	The Jewish category is complex. This is a topic of hot debate. Not all people of Jewish origin are white. I wonder what the Ethiopian Jews would select.  <br><br>
•	Individuals from Melanesian and Aboriginal origins who resemble people of a more direct African decent may not readily identify themselves as Black. My guess is there will be quite a bit a miscoding. <br><br>
•	The ultimate miscoding and exclusion will come from American Indian respondents who utterly refuse to check the Asian category. Quite honestly I had to scan the instrument several times before I even saw the AI category. Placing Am. Indians underneath the Asian category is the ultimate slap in the face and is just more evidence of what results from the log headedness of Eurocentric thinking.     <br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>&#8220;By the time the Greeks placed their own colonies in western Sicily, the Carthaginians had already occupied the western end of the island, and for centuries the two sides struggled indecisively to seize control of the whole island. In 264, the Romans began a major war with the Carthaginians in Sicily (the First Punic War, 264-242), eventually wrestling away Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia from the Carthaginians. During the Second Punic War (218-202), the Carthaginian general Hannibal inflicted major defeats on the Romans, who eventually won the day, restricting the Carthaginians to their own immediate territory in Africa.&#8221; [7]  In 210 <span class="caps">BC, </span>the Roman Consul M. Valerian informed the Senate that &#8220;no Carthaginian remains in Sicily.&#8221; [8]</p>
<p>&#8220;The Arab conquest of Sicily initiated in 827 [AD] was preceded by numerous Saracen invasions of the island while it was still under Byzantine rule. By 902 the island belonged totally to the Arabs [Moors]. &hellip; Norse invaders in the 11th century forced the Arabs to flee. Sicilian Arabs relocated to other countries and the island then came under the control of the Normans. The Norman era closed after 130 years. They had appeared on the Sicilian scene to reconquer the island for Christiandom and the west.&#8221; [9]ROBERT B. <span class="caps">WROTE </span>:I would place real Iranians in the &#8220;white&#8221; category. They are certainly more white then, say, Sicilians- who are a mixture of every passing invasion force in the history of the Mediterranean Sea.    So I guess that some of my blond haired and blue eyed sicilian&rsquo;s relatives are Vikings. As are my wifes family who hail from the the Orkney islands of Scotland.My mothers family came from Corsica where Napoleon was born.

To Aristotle, regarding: </p>
<p>&ldquo;When future historians look back on the decline and fall of america, the push to change the country&rsquo;s demographic composition through immigration reform will stand out as a crucial turning point. Prior US immigration law had sought to maintain the ethnic composition of the country as it has been at the beginning of the 20th century. That project was destroyed by the immigration reform movement, a movement largely lead by jewish americans. It is one thiing I would not be proud of if I were jewish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I write is meant to be thought provoking and not combative, but there is blame enough to go around when it comes to the 1965 Immigration Reform Act. Please consider the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the overwhelming assurances of the bill&rsquo;s supporters, the 1965 Immigration Reform Act has remade society into the image its critics most feared. Immigration levels topping a million a year will increase <span class="caps">U.S. </span>population to 400 million within 50 years. Meanwhile, exponents of multiculturalism insist new arrivals make no effort to assimilate; to do so would be &lsquo;genocidal,&rsquo; a notion that makes a mockery of real genocides. Instead, long-forgotten grudges are nursed against the white populace. Native citizens take to flight as the neighborhoods around them, the norms in their hometowns, are debased for the convenience of low-paid immigrants and well-heeled businessmen. All the while, indigenous paychecks drop through lower wages and higher taxes collected to provide social services for immigrants. And this only takes into account legal immigration. </p>
<p>These results were unforeseen by liberals easily led about by their emotions. Others were not so blind. Jewish organizations had labored since 1924 to unweave national origins quotas by admitting family members on non-quota visas. The B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith Women and the American Council for Judaism Philanthropic Fund, among other Jewish organizations, supported this reform legislation while it was yet in subcommittee in the winter of 1965. Roman Catholics had the twin motivations of still-evolving social justice doctrine and the potential windfall of a mass influx of co-religionists from Latin America. Other organized minorities pressured for increased immigration to benefit relatives in their homelands. The ultra-liberal Americans for Democratic Action, the <span class="caps">ACLU </span>and the National Lawyers Guild joined the chorus. Further, the Communist Party <span class="caps">USA </span>supported higher immigration on the grounds that it destabilizes working Americans.&rdquo;(Ben Johnson, &ldquo;The 1965 Immigration Act: Anatomy of a Disaster,&rdquo; FrontPageMagazine.com, December 10, 2002;please see this link, <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=4991)" rel="nofollow">http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=4991)</a></p>
<p>Thus, it is true enough that Jewish Americans were involved in this horrid debacle but they were hardly the only ones to be blamed. The Jews, at least initially, were motivated by a desire to allow more of their own people into the country; Catholic Americans simply wanted &ldquo;co-religionists&rdquo; regardless of race and national origin, and to feed this evolving sanctimonious sense of Marxist inspired anti-white &ldquo;social justice.&rdquo; Indeed, the now full established need to endlessly foster an altruistic white dispossession guilt trip, that has become so common in the American Church, that I am no longer comfortable attending one! Interestingly, the only people who seem to have been honest in their intentional anti-white American sentiments in 1965, was the Communist Party <span class="caps">USA</span>? The openly cynical lust for power on the part of the Reds, proves that they really are nothing but filth; honest filth to be sure, but filth none the less!</p>
<p>However, I digress; my point was and is that the utterly wretched &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; fecklessness was spread through the entire white community at the time. White, Jewish, and Proud, has no more or less reason to hang her head in shame than do any of the rest of us! We all now live with the results of this stupidity and it is going to be up to all racially conscious white Americans, Jew and Gentile alike, to work together in finding a solution! Again I stress, this is written without rancor or the intent to do anything other than stimulating reflective thoughtfulness! </p>
<p>Best wishes to you Aristotle and for that matter White, Jewish, and Proud,</p>
<p>Sincerely, John PM!</p>

<p>     If you are suggesting that Jews all look alike, that&rsquo;s a patent adsurdity and the lowliest form of ethnic stereotyping.  I don&rsquo;t look like Woody Allen OR Jerry Seinfeld.  What do you think of Tony Curtis, Kirk Douglas, or Michael Landon?  How about former Miss America Bess Myerson?  Not a hook nose on one of &#8216;em!  Like I said I have <span class="caps">NEVER </span>been taken to be Jewish by looks alone, not that that&rsquo;s a bad thing, mind you.  Not even by other Jews.<br>
     Neither one of my parents, grandparents, nor their parents were Gentiles.  As a matter of fact, let me lay this one on you.  Of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, only two are known to be traceable with any kind of certainty: the Kohanes (Cohens) and the Levites, the descendents of Moses and Aaron.  The other ten are lost to antiquity.  I am a Levite; my birth certificate declares it.   And you know, sir, despite what you may think of the Jews, we are a very literate people (nearly 100 percent) and have kept written records throughout our history. <br><br>
     Without belaboring the point, do you suppose that Caucasians sprang up in the cold climate of northern Europe or came from the more temporate climate of the Middle East and migrated across the Mediterranean many thousands of years ago?<br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>My fellow forum attendees;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mistake regarding the meaning of the ethnic label &#8220;Turk&#8221; in the above discussions:</p>
<p>1- Turkic: this is used interchangeably with &#8220;Arabic&#8221; as if it indicates a variant of Arab, or muslim Semitic. Turkic, in actual fact, means the central Asian nomadics that live in places like Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, etc. They are of ** Mongoloid ** origin.</p>
<p>A strong linguistic proof corroborating this is the fact that Turkish is, by roots, a Finno-Ugrian language.</p>
<p>2- The current-day Turkey is composed of a number of elements from the Balkans, Anatolia (ancient Greco-Roman and Byzantine lands), Caucasia, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>There have been so many imperial formations that held sway in Anatolia, that the place can be considered as a sort of ethnic/genetic junkyard. (This does <strong>not</strong> necessarily mean, however, that each and every present-day Turk is a mongrel. The common anthropological rules of ethnic separation apply universally, and most tribes stick with their own kind to keep their property, to continue their traditions, etc. In any case, the modern day physical mobility, the biggest factor in &#8220;desegregation&#8221;, is, well, a very modern phenomenon.)</p>
<p>The last of those formations was the Ottomans, which invaded that lands of more than a dozen tribes and dominated them for centuries. Because the dynasty (which, after the first century or so, descended almost exclusively from women of Byzantine Greek/Jewish, Slavic, and European origin) was known as Turkic, the imperial subjects converted (either by the sword or by the heavy taxation) to Muslim-hood were also considered &#8220;Turkish&#8221;. This must be the greatest known ethnic amnesia in history. The vast majority of the Ottoman-descended Turks (?!) are <strong>not</strong> Turkic.</p>
<p>(Just to give you an idea of the degree of the multi-ethnic activity, Ankara, the capitol of the current Turkish republic, was created by Galatians, a Celtic tribe, back in 3rd century <span class="caps">BC.</span> It then fell to the Romans, to Byzantines, to Seljuks in 1073, then to the Ottomans as late as 1402. I have half a dozen friends from around the villages of that region that are blond or blue-eyed or both, and snow-white and very European in features.)</p>
<p>Please take a look at this page for a bit of <span class="caps">DNA </span>insight: <br>
http://www.ancestrybydna.com/abd30.asp</p>
<p>The greatest mistake that whites in America do, while pondering ethno-political realities, as to think them as if one&rsquo;s handling linguistic or chemical entities - a common side-effect of living in small very homogeneous groups where a number of ethnic indicators are so closely coupled (race, ethnicity, language, religion, culture) that any one is as good as the others as a predictor. So, the word Muslim is instantly associated with Arab, and that with a Semite-Black mongrel. And Turkic is interpreted as a sort of&hellip; well, &#8220;sand negro&#8221;. This is plain ignorant.</p>
<p>The most prominent reason I can think of as a further reinforcer of this tendency is the historical conjuncture. Let me put this in the simplest terms possible: the fact that you resent forced desegragation, forced mass immigration, etc., could make you feel very reluctant to entertain the idea that a Turk (i.e. modern day Turkish citizen; i.e. an Ottoman subject, who could be, with a 20-25% chance, of northern and/or mediterranean European descent) could be white.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put this in perspective: If by white you mean only those &#8220;of north European, preferably Germanic, descent&#8221;, then you have to reject people from countries like Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, etc., as &#8220;non-white&#8221;. If that is your case, don&rsquo;t forget to notify them, with registered mail, about your update of the meaning of the word &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>
<p>If all you want to say is &#8220;I&rsquo;m <strong>not</strong> going to associate with a rotten Turk&#8221;, hey, don&rsquo;t sweat it; you shouldn&rsquo;t have to regenerate all the anthropological nomenclature for that. Freedom of association should be enough.</p>
<p>If it is the &#8220;candidacy&#8221; of Turkey for EU membership you have in mind, again, there&rsquo;s a simpler way of doing it: address the subject directly. Sure, a sizeable portion of Turkey is people of Middle-Eastern (*not* Turkic) descent. But, more importantly, Western Europeans are probably equally infuriated with the prospects of having to support free-loaders like Romania, Bulgaria, or countries with large populations like Poland. In other words, the &#8220;root cause&#8221; of the problem here is the new European Soviet called <span class="caps">EU, </span>with its mercantilist imperial economic design. Europe doesn&rsquo;t need EU to be European. Formulating the problem in its own terms may ease the frustration and horror associated with classifying Turks. ;-]</p>
<p>(Even better, emphasize in all public fora that socialism - yes, that includes the white version eating away Europe - is become death, devourer of civilizations. Move on to a libertarian, free-market-based economy, and abolish the welfare, managerial state. You&rsquo;d be amazed to see how fast Turkey gave up on its membership application, or how quickly Algerians gave up immigrating to France. These measures do not require long, arduous, expensive, and obtuse discussions of &#8220;Mirror mirror on the wall, who&rsquo;s the whitest of us all&#8221;, in addition to being actually more effective in getting results than anthropological minutiae.)</p>
<p>However, none of these will change the simple fact that if a Turkish national is - according to an AncestryByDNA analysis - 72.5% north European, 22.5% Mediterranean, and 5% Asian (Eurasian), I&rsquo;m afraid these figures fail to make him Yemeni, Eskimo, Japanese, Andaman, Sudanese, Bantu, or Maya. He is a European man. And I&rsquo;d advise my fellow Europeans to live with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that American Renaissance readers would want to avoid a reverse political correctness. After all, the phrase is neutral, so just as a claim like &#8220;Race doesn&rsquo;t exist, we&rsquo;re all the same&#8221; is Left-politically correct, &#8220;All Muslims are sand-negros and non-White&#8221; would be Right-politically correct.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p> White, Jewish, and Proud,</p>
<p>Most of the people on this site have read Kevin MacDonald&rsquo;s books (namely &#8220;the culture of critique&#8221;).  It would not hurt to look at the other side of the argument.  Also, for those who continuous beat the jewish drum.  You have some solid points.  Last century we have seen the rise of Liberalism.  And everyone was playing ball. </p>
<p> My own side (irish) produced some of the greatest politicians the world has ever seen.  There are (and have been) Irish politicians on both the right and the left.  But the success of the ones on the left are most disturbing.  </p>
<p>Teddy Kennedy kicked out the 1965 immigration reform and said that if it was doing harm we could change it.  He is a liar.  He is a plastic paddie.  He is a McCromwell.  It is true that many jews thought that it would be good for them to let in a bunch of third worlders.  They are idiots and fools.  I talk to jewish men every day and they are incensed over this stuff as well. Believe me they are raising hell behind the scenes.  I think we have to look at the traitors in our own tribes first.  For instance, Teddy is <span class="caps">NOT </span>getting off the hook by saying:&#8221; the jews made me do it&#8221;.  That will not work for him.  </p>
<p> To White, Jewish, and Proud it is good to have you commenting on this site.  I hold nothing against you.  But as you will find out.  The unbelievable success of the jewish lobbies advocating ideas (and relentlessly pushing) that were horrible for white americans (and jews) means simply that all eyes are on you.   It comes with the territory.</p>
<p>By the way, as you know by now the brown people of the world consider the jews to be &#8220;the whitest of the whites&#8221;.  They consider the jews to be the last of the evil white europeans to colonise the poor brown people as represented by the palestinians.  </p>
<p>Jew like german or Irish   &mdash;  -well these are all abstract concepts only known in the east and the west.  There is a whole lot inbetween.  Jew simply means Gringo of the Gringos   &mdash;  -you are top shelf.  As more and more jews realise this.  They like you are running from the left.  I will welcome them.  But you would be wise to read what the folks are reading on this site and learn to look at things from a differant perspective.  It hurts to look critically at one&rsquo;s own tribe.  </p>
<p>To everyone I say give White, Jewish and Proud a break.  Are Jews white?  Well all the jews I know think they are white.  All of the brown people think they are. That should count for something!  They definately have the suicidal altruism of europeans.  Suicidal and Competitive altruism is a very European thing and they have it in <span class="caps">SPADES. </span> OH and I have yet to see competitive and suicidal altruism thrive in anything but a european!  We are saving whales and the Japanese are eating them. </p></font><p>Posted

 Posted by Lugh at 12:29 PM on June 20 </p>
<p>Dear Luge and danube, allow me to address your crude stereotyping and nakedly anti-Semetic charges one by one.<br>
1) The Jews have never had respect for Traditions, Culture, or Religion.  Oh really?  Tradition? Jewsih religeous traditions and love of learning go back 3,500 years. Culture? The Jewish contribution to Western culture is one of our crowning achievements.  Never more than one percent of the human poplutation, we as a people have won an astounding 24 percent of all Nobel prizes. So put that in your crack pipe and smoke it. <br><br>
Religion?  Well, the development of ethical monotheism was the greatest Jewish contribution to world religeous thought. Ever hear of the Ten Commandments? And quite frankly, without us there&rsquo;d be no you.<br><br>
2) The Jews were thrown out of Europe for good reason.  Yes, that is the old &#8220;the victim was responsible for the crime&#8221; absurdity.  Because it is human nature to look for external sources for ones personal failures, it was easy for uneducated and superstitious poor people to be duped into thinking that they, the outsiders, those pesky Jews, were responsible for their misery and poverty. All the while it was the avaricious monarchs and religous institutions of Europe that kept the boot on their necks and who were the real source of their wretched existence.<br><br>
3) The Jews are responsible for usury, sedition, pornography, etc., etc.  Well, how do I respond to that one? That is simply a variation on the &#8220;the Jews are our misfortune&#8221; theme.  I suppose the if Jews were to disappear tomorrow you would not be left with those issues with the same magnetude after as before.  Is that it? You two could have just as well lifted that from Mein Kampf verbatim.  Enough said.   <br><br>
4) We have a very, very dark side.  I see.  That would be our proclivity toward instigating progroms, euthanasia, slavery, and genocide, would it not?  <br><br>
Please, folks, if you are going to posit assinine arguments, at least attempt to cloak them with a fabric of facts not ethnic stereotypes and prejudice.<br><br>

<p>It is nice to see an American Jew who has rejected the standard American Jew communism.

<p>Thank God they are getting older.  The younger Jews have been subjected to all the hate whites propaganda in school and are changing a little.</p>
<p>That picture of Anwar Sadat.  Actually, Anwar Sadat was a black.  His Father was Southern Egyptian, an area mixed with blacks.  His Mother, get this was a slave whose parents were slaves from the Congo. Dad bought Mom at an auction.</p>
<p>Sadat&rsquo;s mother was regularly beaten by the wives of his Father.<br>
Sadat was fortunate to have been a boy, not a girl.  He was fortunate that there were enough Christians in the area so there was a local Coptic school that taught more than memorize the Koran. Being a boy, he was allowed to go to school.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>I downloaded the law suit against California&rsquo;s 1997 Prop 209, the anti affirmative action measure that passed but is not being applied,(what a surprise).  Of about 80 laywers litigating against equal rights for whites almost all, I think 73 were obviously German and Russian Jewish names.</p>
<p>I myself vowed to never again enter a catholic church when the catholic bishops conference came out in favor of affirmative action.</p>
<p>The cities that were destroyed by black migration and school busing were, by and large catholic and jewish immigrant cities.<br>
The clergy of both religions ignored what was going on right in their faces.  </p>
<p>There was an Italian section of Chicago, Taylor Street, I believe where the black hoodlums preyed on the old Italian ladies coming out of week-day early morning church service.<br>
Not Sunday service of course, where there would have been some men around, but the week day services whose only attendees were the same old ladies whose purses were snatched.</p>

<p>Some of it is not too bad, like how come all the malpractice lawyers driving up our insurance premiums are Jews? But some of it is really insane, such as a certain Jamacian physician who firmly believes that &#8220;the Jews&#8221; murdered Bob Marley.</p>

<p>I am really getting tired of reading statements like this.  Too many people on here think that just because Middle Eastern Caucasians are darker than we are, that they must have some black ancestory.  I don&rsquo;t mean to be ugly but this is plain ignorant.  Middle Eastern Caucasians are darker than we are because they originated at a lower latitude.  In turn, Indian Caucasians are even darker than most Middle Eastern Caucasians for the same reason.  Persians are white because they are mostly descended from Europeans who originated in a northern latitude.  Get it straight.  I&rsquo;m sorry.  There is no nicer way to say it.  I am tired of this ignorance regarding the racial make-up of Middle Easterners.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>To he who said &#8220;Jews and Arabs are of the same descent. Either they both are white or they are not.&#8221;</p>
<p>True, Jews and Arabs are of the same descent, but descent does <span class="caps">NOT </span>mean race.</p>
<p>John Henderson (my neighbour) and his cousin Tyreal Henderson are of the same descent, <span class="caps">BUT </span>they are <span class="caps">NOT </span>of the same race.</p>
<p>You see, John is white and Tyreal is Black. John&rsquo;s father is Bill Henderson and Tyreal&rsquo;s father is Shawn Henderson. Bill and Shawn Henderson are half-brothers, their father Simon, is white, but only Bill&rsquo;s mother is white, and Shawn&rsquo;s is Black, so Shawn is half Black. Shawn&rsquo;s wife (Tyreal&rsquo;s mother) is also black, and so Tyreal is by all means racially black.</p>
<p>Are John and Tyreal of the same descent? <span class="caps">YES, </span>because they are members of the same family. Did race have anything to do with their descent? NO!</p>
<p>If 10 Generations from now Tyreal&rsquo;s descendants continue to marry into other Black families only, will Tyreal&rsquo;s entire line of the Henderson family cease to be of the descent of Simon Henderson, but only Jonh&rsquo;s be of the descent of Simon Henderson? Of course not, they are still of the same descent. This is true even down 10 generations. They are still related by blood though, but they are not of the same race anymore. That is the definition of descent.</p>
<p>Now, are Jews and Arabs of the same descent?<br>
You bet you they are.</p>
<p>So are Jews and Arabs of the same race?<br>
It depends on your understanding of who the &#8220;Jews&#8221; are.</p>
<p>While all Jews are of the same line of descent (as descendants of the family of Abraham, Jacob and Isaac) we do come in a variety of races. However, for most Jews (Ashkenazi Jews, native to Northern and Eastern Europe, 80% of the world&rsquo;s Jewish population) that Middle Eastern line is the residual element of our overall ancestry (even though it&rsquo;s the descent which provides our identity), but racially we are white. Our racial composition, over our thousand-year history in Europe, was replaced by a systematic influx of European genes, to the point where we Ashkenazim are racially European.</p>
<p>So in the case of Ashkenazi Jews, <span class="caps">NO, </span>they are not of the same race as Arabs. The Ashkenazim are White Europeans. Ashkenazim are of Middle Eastern (Jewish) descent, but our race is no longer that. We are white, and racially we are not related to Middle Easterners, even though by descent we are related.</p>
<p>Then you have Sephardi Jews, Ethiopian Jews, Iraqi Jews, Indian Jews, Iranian Jews, Egyptian Jews, etc. These Jews are not white.</p>
<p>As for Iraqi Jews, Iranian Jews, Egyptian Jews (and others of the kind), these Jews are not White. They <span class="caps">ARE </span>of the same race as Arabs. An Ethipoian Jew is neither of the White race, nor of the same race as Arabs, they are of the same race as other Black Ethiopians, it&rsquo;s just that they are of Jewish descent. And so on with all the other types of Jews.</p>
<p>Even though I am a White Jew, and not of the same race as an Iraqi Jew, or an Ethiopian Jew, or an Indian Jew, I recognize that we are of the same descent. I even recognize that I am of the same descent of and Arab (because he is related to my Middle Eastern forefathers), but I am not of his race, nor is he of mine.</p>
<p>The fact that your argument for &ldquo;if Jews are white then so are Arabs&rdquo;, shows how you don&rsquo;t understand the reason as to <span class="caps">WHY </span>the Jews (and I do mean only the Ashkenazim) are White. As far as I know, the Arabs and Jews indigenous to the Middle East are still Semitic both in descent and race, and haven&rsquo;t had their racial composition recomposed by centuries of absorption of European genes.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Very interesting stuff. I am curious whether the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>census Bureau will make any neccessary changes on upcoming reports.</p>
<p>I am from Canada, and when I first read that &#8220;Middle Easterners&#8221; and &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; were being lumped together with &#8220;whites&#8221; on census reports in the United States, I was intially very confused. I have also read that Ethiopians and Somalis are regularly classified as white by the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Census Bureau. Why is there so much confusion on this matter,I wonder?</p>
