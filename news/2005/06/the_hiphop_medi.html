<p>The murders of Biggie and Tupac in the 90&rsquo;s sent tremors through the hip-hop world and sent fans into mourning. But that world has become inured to killings, thanks to recording executives who seem to be competing with one another to land the most violent material possible. Further fanning the love affair with crime are the &ldquo;street bible&rdquo; publications, which make violence seem normal through their editorial policies. </p>
<p>The July issue of the magazine XXL &mdash; &ldquo;The Jail Issue&rdquo; &mdash; trumpets &ldquo;exclusive interviews&rdquo; with &ldquo;hip-hop&rsquo;s incarcerated soldiers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That issue, which is consistent with the material emanating from similar magazines, hails rappers like C-Murder, (a k a C-Miller) who is serving time in connection with a shooting, and Drama, sent up for armed robbery and assault &mdash; as well as several others who are hailed as geniuses, with little apparent concern for their victims. </p>
<p>For the time being, makers of luxury goods seem to have embraced this &ldquo;crime pays&rdquo; marketing strategy. They buy into the disturbing vision offered by some of these magazines. The message is disastrous for minority young people, who are already at risk of spending their lives in prison or of dying prematurely from street violence. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, &ldquo;The Jail Issue&rdquo; of XXL is fattened by advertisements placed by General Motors and Mennen deodorant, and apparel makers like K-Swiss and Perry Ellis. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>I can already envision what the comments look like. Like everything else, it&rsquo;s so much easier to say &#8216;rap&rsquo; and not get into anymore details, like, for instance, rap circa 1980&rsquo;s. Rap before &#8216;gangster&rsquo; rap hit it big on a population that was only approximately 12 percent &#8216;black&rsquo; American in 1991 and somehow took over the label as the one and only rap. I listen to some rap. I don&rsquo;t listen to &#8216;gangster&rsquo; rap. And I tell you now, there is a big difference in rap styles. I whole heartedly agree that &#8216;gansta&rsquo; rap thrives on violence, derogatory names for females, rape, drugs, pimps, prostitutes, spending large amounts of money on crap like wheels that spin, and jail time. But, that&rsquo;s not all rap.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>This is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>There is a magazine called <span class="caps">F.E.D.S. </span>that is devoted not just to hip-hop, but glorification of every single aspect of the &#8220;gangsta&#8221; lifestyle, complete with articles about Al Capone and his ilk in every issue (black gangsters have a huge interest in white gangsters and they all seem to adore the movie &#8220;Scarface&#8221; - go figure!)  The issue I saw had an interview with some higher-up in the Gangster Disciples who had poliical aspirations in Chicago.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I often wonder how low contemporary black culture can sink, such as it is. To call rap &#8220;music&#8221; is a stretch and it generally reflects on the adherents and promoters of the so-called &#8220;art.&#8221; Rap stars are thugs and criminals selling a mysoginistic, violent music so completely devoid of any grace, beauty and harmony that I cannot believe people actully listen to the stuff. Black kids would be a lot better off listening to their forebears like Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, (and on and on) rather then waste time with the rubbish called rap. On the other hand, there&rsquo;s always the hope that &#8220;rap artists&#8221; will eventually all just kill each other or end up in jail. </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Finally someone has exposed rap music for what it really is. I&rsquo;m so sick and tired of people talking trash about heavy metal, which is my favorite type of music. How often do heavy metal bands condone the murders of members of other bands? Hardly ever.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>     To My Ears Hurt:  Even if they all killed each other off tomorrow, the next day there would be a new crop of these little bastards out there making this offensive noisy crap.  I too am pretty much dumbstruck as to how low some blacks will sink in their search for new crapola to market as &#8220;talent&#8221;.  </p>
<p>   I love Ella Fitzgerald  &mdash;  absolutely adore her voice and her songs she sang.  This was such a hugely talented woman, who happened to be black, that it&rsquo;s just nothing short of a crime to what depths blacks are sinking to in their quest for what they now call &#8220;music&#8221; (which it is not).  And the really sad thing is that most of these little shits wouldn&rsquo;t even consider Ella to be black enough because she sang white music.    Now, I&rsquo;m not a fan of Billie Holliday  &mdash;  she was a slut, a druggie,  and a really horrible person, even other blacks will attest to this.  But Ella tried to live her life on a higher level, and probably supported scores of family members on her voice and talent for many years.  She was a hard working woman, and sang and toured well into her later years.  But, of course, blacks couldn&rsquo;t admire her for these qualities  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re far too &#8220;white&#8221;.  </p>
<p>     When I think of some of the truly great female singers of last century, a few come to mind:  Judy Garland, Dinah Shore, Jo Stafford, Rosemary Clooney, Barbra Streisand, Edith Piaf, Julie Andrews, and Ella Fitzgerald.  Of course, there are a lot more, but these are a few of the really unique voices.  How sad that black people have allowed their &#8220;culture&#8221; to be hijacked by a bunch of lowlife thugs and criminals and idiots.  </p>
<p>    To Token Black Guy:  Why do blacks continue to allow their &#8220;culture&#8221; to be drawn down to the lowest common denominator instead of aiming a little higher?  Kinda makes people like me think maybe they can&rsquo;t&hellip;&hellip; </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Talk about odd: I am at my best friend&rsquo;s condo right now and i just saw that same magazine edition laying on his table, &#8220;The Jail Issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>I read all of the rapper&rsquo;s letters from prison and it was alarming to see that not one of them talked about how they want to change and live a better life once they are released. It was all about them commiting violent crimes and having to stay &#8220;gangsta&#8221; in prison in order to stay alive. They were all creating new rap lyrics in their cells, and one thug wrote that he was even reading African-American History in his spare time. One rapper wrote that it was weird to have the guard officers talking down to him. One guy was talking about how he is addicted to guns and won&rsquo;t ever give them up.</p>
<p>With out a doubt, they will be right back in prison very soon, which is fine with me.</p>
<p>So shall i take the magazine from him and burn it???</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I&rsquo;m currently taking a summer college course on gangs.  Judging from what I&rsquo;ve learned so far, &#8220;gangsta rap&#8221; is often used by gang members to send coded messages to each other.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise to me that since this kind of junk sells, so do games like &#8220;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&#8221; which glorify the gangster lifestyle.  The only reason for rock music being used in the commercials for this game is that Rockstar Games is trying to attract White gamers to the gang life.</p>
<p>With all the violence surrounding this garbage posing as music, I find it hypocritical that all the left does is gripe about how &#8220;dangerous&#8221; and &#8220;offensive&#8221; White power music is.  True, some of it is junk, but I would much rather listen to Skrewdriver or Saga than Snoop Dogg or Eminem (race traitor) any day.    </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>What&rsquo;s to be done after a poison has been released into the bloodstream? Answer: keep it from spreading as much as possible. Back in 1996, Delores Tucker began her campaign to raise public awareness to the socially and spiritually destructive nature of &#8220;rap&#8221; music, she and the other blacks who supported her crusade were subjected to virulent verbal attacks. And when Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem&rsquo;s Abyssinian Baptist Church, led a similar campaign to denounce the &#8220;spirit-killing&#8221; vulgarity at the heart of rap, he fared no better. </p>
<p>Now, almost a decade later, the contagion, initially spawned by desolate, angry products of turbulent households, has spread more deeply into mainstream society and has evolved into an animus known as &#8220;hip-hop.&#8221; Picked up, exploited and disseminated by an amoral breed of commercializers, the poison now infects vast numbers of youth. </p>
<p>In &#8220;Gangsta <span class="caps">GOP,</span>&#8221; on &#8220;Davey D&rsquo;s Hip Hop Daily News,&#8221; a white father, identified as John Kressler, is quoted as either boasting or complaining that his &#8220;good, Christian son&#8221; has been convinced through this musical genre &#8220;to act like a little gangbanger from the inner city,&#8221; has &#8220;adopted some of [the] habits, values and mannerisms&#8221; of his favorite rapper, and &#8220;walks around the house mimicking this new African American rap style of speech.&#8221; </p>
<p>Make no mistake about it: hip-hop is a disease and one that may be with us for some time to come, I&rsquo;m afraid. To treat this infection, education is the key. For a broader and better perspective on the rap contagion, I highly recommend that the American Renaissance posters here read John H. McWhorter&rsquo;s excellent essay, &#8220;How Hip-Hop Holds Blacks Back,&#8221; which can be found here: </p>

      <a id="c55441"></a>
  <font size="3"><p>I agree that the McWhorter article recommeded by Kwaku Minta is excellent. Its subtitle   &mdash;   &#8220;Violence, misogyny, and lawlessness are nothing to sing about.&#8221;   &mdash;   says it all.</p>
<p>As The Token Black Guy says, there are different varieties of rap and not all is bad. McWhorter recalls the early days when rap was a harmless bubble-gum pop type of music. I can remember records from the &rsquo;60s or &rsquo;70s by jazz vocalist Andy Bey which may have been the precursors of the rap genre. I&rsquo;ve even heard Christian artists who use the rap beat to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>However, it is the content of most contemporary rap or hip-hop which is an insidious influence. The medium has been taken over by murderers and rapists who use it to glorify and profit from their conduct. Those who defend this kind of rap need to consider its message and consequences. As McWhorter concludes   &mdash;   &#8220;Hip-hop creates nothing.&#8221;</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>It is funny, Italian mobsters have always been notorious for their unwillingness to hire or have anything to do with blacks in their business.  This was true for Capone and John Gotti.  It has been shown in such movies as The Godfather Parts I and <span class="caps">III.</span> I find it ironic that these blacks &#8220;gangsters&#8221; want to emulate people who hate them.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The only way I can relate to this &#8220;Hip-Hop&#8221; culture is as if Rudy Vallee threatened to kill Al Jolson through a song he was singing.What would have happened to their career&rsquo;s given the culture of their time ? They would be over! I could not ever imagine the &#8220;Rat Pack&#8221; e.g Sinatra,Dean Martin,Sammy Davis Jr. ever publicly feuding with Tony Bennett to the point of murder even if they ever did have serious difference&rsquo;s of opinion.Imagine Elton John treatening to kill Paul McCartney.The Beach boy&rsquo;s singing on the radio about how they would murder Jan &amp; Dean because they were the better Surfer group? The Beatles in in a gunfire feud with the Rolling Stone&rsquo;s ?<br>
  To me,  &#8220;Hip-Hop&#8221; is not even Music.It&rsquo;s noise.<br><br>
