						<p>Popular music has had a heavy, leftist overlay since at least the 1950s.
Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and Bob Dylan made protest a central part of their
message, and performers who are not as explicitly political continue to
give popular music an unmistakably lefty slant. Like Hollywood, the recording
industry has had a deliberately corrosive effect on every sentiment and
tradition healthy nationalism requires. This is still true for most commercially
successful performers but there is a growing musical subculture that reflects
something entirely different: a resurgence of patriotism, national identity,
and even racial consciousness. The mainstream media and the music press
have carefully avoided publicizing this trend, but it is growing so quickly
below ground that it cannot help occasionally breaking the surface.
<p>What kind of music is this? Who are the performers? Is this just adolescent
rebellion or do white power bands reflect real racial commitment? Most
people have heard about skinheads but very few know about Apocalyptic Folk,
NR, or Black Metal music. I have been part of this movement myself – first
as a fan, later as an active performer – and believe I can report with
some authority on a phenomenon nonparticipants are not likely to understand.
<p>The skinhead movement began in England in the late 1960s when young
people emerging from the Mod (short for Modern) youth culture followed
the lead of rock groups such as <i>The Who</i>, and wore Mod clothing draped
in the Union Jack. Skinheads took most of the Mod style – Doctor Marten
boots, short hair cuts, patriotism, a penchant for scooters, loud music,
and violence – and carried it even further.&nbsp;

                </center>
<p>Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s the skinheads were, for the
most part, non-ideological toughs, known for football hooliganism (rioting
at soccer games) and Paki-bashing (beating up Pakistani or Indian immigrants).
Among the first skinhead bands were <i>Slade</i> and <i>Dexy&rsquo;s Midnight
Runners</i>, the latter to become known for their international hit &#8220;C&rsquo;mon
Eileen.&#8221;

By the mid- to late 1970s the skin-heads were beginning to become politicized,
and were welcomed by the Young National Front, the official youth wing
of the National Front, which started enthusiastically promoting skinhead
music. By the 1980s the term skinhead was firmly associated with nationalist
groups like the National Front and the British National Party. There is
still some association between skinheads and the British National Party,
but the decline of the once-powerful National Front was due, at least in
part, to a falling out with the musicians, who had been some of the party&rsquo;s
best youth recruiters.&nbsp;
<p>It was during this period of political activism that a new skinhead-specific
music movement took shape. This movement was called Oi! which was the Cockney
word for &#8220;Hey!&#8221; and was a kind of white working-class battle cry for musically-oriented
skinheads. It was by means of this music that skinhead politics went international.
Thus, through the 1980s and 1990s, the movement was no longer associated
specifically with England, but with disaffected white youth worldwide.
By the 1990s, Oi! had largely faded in favor of even more racially charged
music styles such as RAC (Rock Against Communism/Capitalism) and Hate Core
(the latter being mostly an American phenomenon.) The most popular skin-head
bands today are <i>Skrewdriver</i>, (England) <i>Brutal Attack</i>, (England)
and <i>Bound for Glory</i> (USA).
<p>Another less well known but highly influential development of the early
1980s National Front-era of British-turned-pan-European music is what is
called Apocalyptic Folk. This movement draws less aggressive and often
more intellectual audiences, and grew up around a little-known London-based
punk band called <i>Crisis</i>. Tony Wake-ford, who had left <i>Crisis</i>
to form a National Front band called <i>Above the Ruins</i>, rejoined <i>Crisis</i>
bandmate Douglas Pearce in 1981. The group changed its name to <i>Death
in June</i>, began to dabble in openly Nazi imagery, and started a movement.
<p><i>Death in June</i> began recording songs about the catastrophic effects
of the Second World War on Europe and the decline of Western Civilization.
Songs like &#8220;Death of the West&#8221; and &#8220;We Drive East&#8221; lamented the devastating
conflict between Russia and Germany that ended the war, and the lack of
honor, discipline, and high standards in modern European institutions.
It is highly reflective music, mixing modern and medieval folk with more
modern electronic sounds.
<p>Besides <i>Death in June</i>, the biggest bands in this genre are <i>Sol
Invictus</i> (Latin for Unconquerable Sun, a name for the Persian God Mithras
revered by Roman soldiers), and <i>Strength Through Joy</i> (Ireland).
<i>Death
in June</i> and <i>Strength Through Joy</i> recently drew a crowd of 600
at the historic El Rey Theater in Los Angeles, to the dismay of the media
and despite leftist threats.
<p>A more recent form of music has sprung up around the French National
Front. It is called NR music (short for <i>Nationale r&eacute;volutionaire</i>).
While its roots are in the Italian right&rsquo;s Alternative Music from the 1970s,
it has really begun anew in France with the help of National Front radio
programs such as &#8220;Radio Courtoisie.&#8221; These bands avoid overtly racial themes,
preferring to concentrate on the French Nationalist struggle. This music,
also known as <i>Rock identitaire</i> (Identity Rock) often has a more
pop-rock sound. These groups often work French medieval songs into their
sets, a practice common in National Romantic movements the world over.
The leading bands of this type are <i>Ile de France</i>, <i>Vae Victus</i>,
and <i>In Memoriam</i>.&nbsp;
<p>Yet another genre that has surfaced more recently is Black Metal. As
its name suggests, it evolved from Heavy Metal. This movement didn&rsquo;t really
take off until the 1990s, and has just begun to go global, but is now one
of the fastest growing underground music movements. From the beginning,
Black Metal was a backlash against mainstream music. It sneered at the
mainstream music industry&rsquo;s watered down, effeminate rock musicians, and
its performers tried to put a violent manliness and aggression back into
rock music.&nbsp;
<p>When Black Metal began in Norway it was openly Satanic, but has matured
over the past several years. It is no longer so concerned with shock value,
and has developed an ideology that has taken a hard turn to the right.
Beginning with the bands <i>Burzum</i> (its name is a made-up word from
the writings of J.R.R. Tolkein and signifies eternal darkness) and <i>Dark
Throne</i>, the movement has traded in much of its alarming Satanism for
aggressive nationalism, racial consciousness, and a celebration of Norse
culture.&nbsp;
<p>Like the Apocalyptic Folk bands, it is now quite common for Black Metal
bands to include traditional folk songs on their albums. The cover art
on their CDs is of traditional statues, artifacts, and nature scenes from
the native countryside. Varg Vikarness, lead singer of <i>Burzum</i> has
been chided by the music press for his unabashed racial statements, and
violent nationalistic rhetoric.&nbsp;
<p>Aside from ideology, an important development in this music has been
its turn towards a medieval folk sound. One leading band, Ulver, known
for fast, aggressive guitar and unearthly shrieking vocals, recently released
a completely acoustic CD with medieval chorus, flutes, and classical guitar,
in an amazing show of virtuosity that rivals any classical CD.
<p><i>Storm</i>, a group that broke away from <i>Dark Throne</i>, describes
itself in its premier CD as National Romantic Music. This CD celebrates
the glory of Norway and of Norse culture, including proud chants of &#8220;Hail
Norway!&#8221; in its own brand of neo-traditional, folk-influenced, heavy-metal
music. Half the songs are Norwegian folk tunes, played electrically and
aggressively. This has been a very influential CD, with new bands such
as Sweden&rsquo;s <i>Vintersorg</i> imitating this medieval-operatic heavy-metal
style. The leading racial Black Metal bands are <i>Graveland</i>, <i>Veles</i>,
and <i>Gontyna Kry</i>.
                <p><img src="/news/2005/06/sun.gif" hspace="6" vspace="10" height="189" width="190" align="LEFT">While 
                  MTV would lead us to believe that young people want nothing 
                  but self-indulgence, tens of thousands of aggressively patriotic 
                  and racially conscious CDs are sold every year on independent 
                  record labels – without any mainstream publicity. Some of these 
                  sentiments have occasionally appeared above-ground. 
                <p>Until just a few years ago, the Englishman, known only by his performing
name &#8220;Morissey&#8221; and former front man of <i>The Smiths</i>, was topping
charts all over the world. That was until the 1992 release of possibly
his best-produced, most well thought out and musically advanced CD to date,
&#8220;Your Arsenal.&#8221; On this CD Morissey voiced concern for the future of his
country with songs like &#8220;National Front Disco,&#8221; and there are clearly nationalist
sentiments throughout the album. The same British press that used to fawn
over him quickly dubbed him a fascist and consigned him to worldwide obscurity.
<p>Some may remember the Swedish group <i>Ace of Base</i> whose CD &#8220;The
Sign,&#8221; released in 1994, was the number-one selling album in the world.
At the height of its popularity, with multiple hits to its credit, it came
out that founding member Ulf Eckberg had a history as a racial activist
in Sweden. While Madonna, and even nonentities like Cher continue to churn
out unin-spiring CDs for decades and get endless air play, a racially-conscious
past guarantees any musician, no matter how talented, a one-CD career.
<p>The rock group <i>Ultima Thule</i> from Sweden recently had a number-one
hit on the Swedish charts, by electrifying and performing an Oi! version
of the Swedish national anthem, &#8220;Du Gamla Du Frig.&#8221; This chart-topper got
Swedish youth tapping their toes to their national anthem and brought the
Swedish flag and the Thor&rsquo;s Hammer pendant back into vogue until a smear-by-association
campaign ended a short-lived but highly successful musical career. Critics
discovered that <i>Ultima Thule</i> used to be on a white power record
label from Germany called Rock-O-Rama, and had appeared on a white power
compilation called &#8220;No Surrender!&#8221; along with British National Front bands
such as <i>Skrewdriver</i>, <i>Brutal Attack</i>, and Above the Ruins.
On their own albums <i>Ultima Thule</i> had never mentioned non-whites
or used racial slurs.
<p>The German group <i>B&ouml;hse Onkelz </i>(the Evil Uncles) hit number
two on the German charts, and suddenly disappeared from view just like
Morissey, <i>Ace of Base</i>, and <i>Ultima Thule</i> after the discovery
of similar past associations. In the United States as well, Time Warner
dropped the heavy metal band <i>Morbid Angel</i> shortly after the lead
singer expressed certain views publicly.
<p>A couple of fairly mainstream American heavy metal bands have narrowly
escaped the media blacklist, largely because they&rsquo;ve not quite reached
superstar status. <i>Pantera</i>, possibly one of the biggest and longest-running
heavy metal bands in America got into trouble when singer Phil Anselmo
sported a T-shirt emblazoned with the three-pronged symbol of the South
African Afrikaner Resistance Movement during an MTV interview. Mr. Anselmo
also went on a couple of racial tirades from stage while on tour, but with
a lot of back peddling he was able to save his career.&nbsp;
<p>A group called <i>Type O-Negative</i>, has been made to answer a lot
of questions about some extremely racially provocative songs they recorded
previously under the name <i>Carnivore</i>. Unlike most bands, <i>Type
O-Negative</i> offered no apologies and still enjoys as much success as
its talents merit.&nbsp;

                </center>
<p>Finally, the old standby, Ted Nugent, hardly a representative of any
New Right youth movement, was recently threatened by the League of United
Latin American Citizens for declaring that anyone in America who doesn&rsquo;t
speak English should leave. Mr. Nugent also made no apologies.&nbsp;
<p>Not so lucky was the well-known heavy metal performer Glen Danzig. He
expressed racial views publicly in magazine interviews, and even went so
far as to record a song called &#8220;White Devil Rise!,&#8221; which he later declined
to release on CD. He was dropped from American Records shortly afterwards.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thugs or Thinkers?</font></b>
<p>So what do we have here: a bunch of drunken thugs out to shock their
parents or a thriving underground of racially-conscious young people making
and listening to their own brand of exploratory music? Both, really. Something
people must understand about these movements is that they <i>are</i> meant
to shock. They are rebellions and draw rebellious young people. Many of
their followers will never straighten out their lives no matter what kind
of music they like. They were corrupted by MTV, bad parents, and a miserable
public school system long before our music reached them. We can&rsquo;t expect
more from the average skinhead than we can from the average white American
of any kind.&nbsp;
<p>The importance of these movements is that they offer ideas to many middle-class
whites who may simply be passing through a period of teenage rebellion
– ideas to which they might not otherwise be exposed. I myself was brought
into racial consciousness through the skinhead movement and through music
in particular. When today&rsquo;s teenagers go on to college or a career many
will hold on to the ideas they picked up during their rebellious youth.
Just as the corrupt ideology of the drug-filled hippie and communist movements
of the 1960s did not fade away, but instead moved quietly into positions
of power, one can already distinguish the rise of an intellectual and successful
youth elite in the racial movement in America. These are not people who
would have joined the Klan in the 1960s or 1970s, and I believe they will
be able to give far better racial leadership than they ever received.
<p>There are also benefits for the more mediocre fans who will never amount
to much. They learn to take pride in their race, not to miscegenate, not
to take drugs (though there is much drinking of alcohol), and not to practice
abortion. Outsiders have no idea how militantly the overwhelming majority
of skinheads follow these rules. So, while these music cults may not be
Ph.D. training camps, they are the one organized means today of fostering
racial consciousness in young whites. For the worst among them, it also
offers a life without drugs, and for those who will be more successful
it lays the groundwork for a racial worldview that will guide them through
life. These young people have a fierce and troubled appearance, but ideologically
they are much better off than the average teenager.&nbsp;
<p>However unpleasant much of this music may sound to the older generations,
it reaches the MTV generation in a way that books do not. It is all very
well for their racially conscious elders to write carefully-footnoted research
papers about immigration or IQ, but they have been doing this for years
with few results.
<center>
                  <p><img src="/news/2005/06/stormart.jpg" height="386" width="385"> 
                </center>
<p>Even its most hostile detractors must recognize the powerful appeal
of this new music. It has become widespread despite the fact that in Europe
and Canada it is illegal to express certain racial ideas, and you can get
fines and jail sentences for possession of these CDs. In Germany, France,
and many other European countries, white power CDs are treated as contraband,
just like drugs. Customs officials confiscate packages with addresses from
known white power distributors or directed to suspected European distributors.
Police routinely raid the homes of young people they think are selling
these CDs. People caught with what is judged to be a commercial quantity
get fines up to the equivalent of $10,000 for the first offense, and may
be jailed at the court&rsquo;s discretion. Young people will not take risks of
this kind to distribute books by Philippe Rushton or Arthur Jensen.
<p>The older generation complains about the biased media but the skinheads
and other youth cults have succeeded where their elders have failed: They
have created <i>their own</i> media. With glossy color magazines like <i>Resistance</i>
and slickly packaged, well produced recordings, they have completely cut
the mainstream music industry out of the picture. So, while we complain
about the state of our media, and continue to give money to Time Warner
they give a large amount of their entertainment budget to a pro-white industry
owned by pro-white organizations.
<p>The entertainment industry is profitable. Because the mainstream media
will not touch white racial consciousness, it means that this important
source of funds stays entirely within our movement. For whatever it&rsquo;s worth,
the Anti-Defamation League&rsquo;s estimate of the annual revenues of Resistance
Records is one million dollars. And Resistance is just one of many magazines
and record labels around the world.
                <p>Today&rsquo;s huge media corporations promote black performers who 
                  encourage drug-taking, violent abuse of women, murder, and hatred 
                  of whites while they vilify any white who dares sing about love 
                  of country and culture, or respect for veterans, the elderly, 
                  women, family, children, hard work, and racial heritage. The 
                  media and the music industry have succeeded in turning morality 
                  on its head. Racially-conscious music could help set things 
                  straight again.
