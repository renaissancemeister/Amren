						<p>TOKYO &mdash; A writer&rsquo;s death can do wonders for pushing that back catalog. Less drastically, a few books acquire cachet by being banned. </p>
<p>Which may help explain why a reissue of &ldquo;Little Black Sambo,&rdquo; a turn-of-the-20th century illustrated children&rsquo;s book attacked as being racist, is on the bestseller lists in Japan this spring.</p>
<p>The Japanese edition of &ldquo;Sambo&rdquo; was a big favorite here, from the time it was introduced in 1953 until it was yanked from bookstores in 1988 after a swift and effective anti-racism campaign. </p>
<p>The rap against it in Japan echoed that heard in the West years earlier: Sambo was a racist term for American blacks and illustrator Frank Dobias&rsquo; portrayal of the main character, with his bulging white eyes and exaggerated, thick lips, was tantamount to a boy drawn in blackface.</p>
<p>In April, Zuiunsha, a small Tokyo publisher specializing in reprints, bet that there was still a market for a book that had charmed generations of Japanese youngsters who, as adults, were unable to find the book to read to their own children. </p>
<p>The market proved him right. Zuiunsha reportedly has sold 95,000 copies in two months since bringing out &ldquo;Chibikuro Sambo.&rdquo; Despite being a child&rsquo;s read at a thin 16 pages, &ldquo;Sambo&rdquo; sits among the top five adult fiction bestsellers at major Tokyo book chains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people buy it out of nostalgia,&rdquo; said Tomio Inoue, Zuiunsha&rsquo;s president, who gambled that he wouldn&rsquo;t face a backlash for breaking the informal ban when he picked up the rights to the book. &ldquo;Many readers didn&rsquo;t know why it was out of print. They missed the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sambo&rdquo; has returned to shelves with few objections in a country where blacks remain extremely rare. One complaint has been published in an English-language newspaper, written by an African American resident of Japan. An online petition against the publisher garnered 263 signatures by Saturday, most of them from non-Japanese, many from abroad.</p>
<p>That is a far cry from 1988, when a mainly American campaign drove the book off Japanese shelves. The undoing was triggered by a report in the Washington Post that noted the popularity of a book &ldquo;that most Americans thought had died a well-deserved death years ago,&rdquo; as well as several Sambo-related doll items on sale in Tokyo department stores. </p>
<p>The article spawned a letter-writing campaign in Japan from the Assn. to Stop Racism Against Blacks, which was later discovered to be essentially a one-family enterprise.</p>
