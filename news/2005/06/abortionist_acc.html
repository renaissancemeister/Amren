<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=44779">Abortionist Accused of Eating Fetuses</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WorldNetDaily, June 14</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Kansas City abortionist is out of business after investigators discovered a grisly house of horrors at his clinic &mdash; with fetuses kept in Styrofoam cups in his refrigerator and one employee accusing him of microwaving one and stirring it into his lunch. </p>
<p>The unsanitary conditions in Krishna Rajanna&rsquo;s clinic prompted legislative approval of new abortion regulations in Kansas, a bill that was vetoed by the governor. Rajanna&rsquo;s activities have reportedly been the subject of law-enforcement investigations for nearly two years. </p>
<p>Rajanna first came to the attention of police in September 2003 when he called police to investigate alleged employee theft. </p>
<p>Detective William Howard of the Kansas City Police Department responded. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I had heard and seen every vile, disgusting crime scene, but was in for a new shock when I started this investigation,&rdquo; he would say later. Howard turned the matter over to the local district attorney and three state agencies. </p>
<p>Topping the list of horrors was an employee&rsquo;s account that she and others witnessed Rajanna &ldquo;microwave one of the aborted fetuses and stir it into his lunch,&rdquo; as Howard recalled earlier this year when testifying before a Kansas House committee. </p>
<p>Rajanna denied the accusation. But he did keep fetuses in Styrofoam cups in the refrigerator along with food and drink. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Rajanna lacked personal hygiene,&rdquo; testified Howard. &ldquo;His hair was messy, hands dirty, and his clothing was wrinkled and stained. He put on old, used foot booties while we were there.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Howard testified the clinic was dark, dingy, had poor lighting and smelled musty. There were dirty dishes in the break-room sink and on the table, trash everywhere, and roaches crawling on the countertops. Howard was afraid to sit down. </p>
