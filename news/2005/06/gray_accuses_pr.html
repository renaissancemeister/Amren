<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Holding court yesterday near the altar where he preaches, Darryl Gray railed at the United Church hierarchy that showed him the door.</p>
<p>His frequent target was the spokesperson for the Montreal Presbytery of the United Church of Canada.</p>
<p>Gray, pastor at Union United Church, accused Fred Braman of racially insensitive comments for suggesting in a media interview that Union United, in Little Burgundy, demands &ldquo;sizzle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Mr. Braman does not understand about this church is that they demand substance &mdash; and that&rsquo;s what they get,&rdquo; Gray said.</p>
<p>The Montreal presbytery announced this week it had ended Gray&rsquo;s admission as a minister of the church.</p>
<p>It said it did so in the belief Gray would not complete the required master of divinity degree by the agreed upon &mdash; and extended &mdash; deadline. (The presbytery said the degree is a United Church requirement for ministers from another denomination.)</p>
<p>As a result, they said, his stint as pastor ends June 30.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Gray, the high-profile community leader, fired back.</p>
<p>Union United demands as much as any other church, Gray said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does (Braman) insult this congregation?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Why does he limit what this congregation needs and wants? Is it because we are black &mdash; a black congregation in a black community?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gray said he did not think the remark reflected the United Church of Canada, but rather an attitude &ldquo;that is too prevalent in the Montreal presbytery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised the race issue again during his news conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t turn a family&rsquo;s world upside down and expect nobody to challenge it,&rdquo; Gray said.</p>
<p>The same applies for a congregation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a plantation. And I choose my words very carefully. I know what I&rsquo;m saying. It&rsquo;s not a plantation and we&rsquo;re not house Negroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an interview, Braman said he was proud of the United Church&rsquo;s record on race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a church that celebrates diversity. So to pull out that card doesn&rsquo;t impress anyone. Because the racism card is being played here not for Union, but for Darryl. And that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a black man who failed to perform what he had promised to do. It&rsquo;s Darryl Gray. Because there are many black men who have been willing, able and superbly gifted to do it. And this is a person who didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When United Church officials talk about why they ended Gray&rsquo;s term as pastor, they focus on his academics. Gray suggested other reasons prompted the decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not about my academic status&hellip; .   It is about a former American, former Baptist &hellip; sometimes conservative black preacher who refuses to be muzzled, restricted by anybody. It&rsquo;s about personalities &hellip; but not just mine. It&rsquo;s about the personalities of those who would continue to be gatekeepers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presbytery officials didn&rsquo;t think Gray showed a willingness to become a United Church minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darryl has alienated every single one of the decision-making persons in this process &mdash; anyone who has ever touched his file,&rdquo; Braman said.</p>
<p>Gray maintained he doesn&rsquo;t have a problem with obtaining the master&rsquo;s degree at some point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not academically challenged, by any stretch of the imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he took issue with was a rigidity in the process, Gray said.</p>
<p>No one factored in things that happened during that time, he said. He cited personal problems and major surgery in 2003 that forced him out of the master&rsquo;s program to recuperate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things happen in the human experience &hellip; things that we don&rsquo;t factor into the time frame. It&rsquo;s just called human life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Braman responded: &ldquo;We did make allowances for lots of things. There is a time when confidence and faith break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked if he bore any blame for what happened, Gray said he has made it clear he shares responsibility.</p>
<p>He mused that perhaps he should have taken a sabbatical from the church to pursue his studies because &ldquo;being a full-time pastor in a congregation like Union is a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the &ldquo;sizzle&rdquo; comment, Braman said Union United likes a charismatic preacher style that wouldn&rsquo;t be received the same in other congregations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not in any way demeaning,&rdquo; he said of the remark. &ldquo;It was in recognition of the distinctive needs and type of congregation that it is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly want substance. These people live their gospel day to day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an unusual move, the church board meeting that discussed Gray&rsquo;s fate on Monday spilled over to last night.</p>
<p>Gray&rsquo;s criticisms raise questions about what will happen on June 30.</p>
<p>Gray has said he will stay on at Union United &mdash; and keep living in the manse &mdash; if asked by the congregation.</p>
<p>He insisted Union United owns the buildings. Presbytery officials insisted they are owned by the United Church of Canada.</p>
<p>Braman did not want to discuss the church&rsquo;s legal recourse. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not at that stage. We&rsquo;re at the stage of dialogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gray said the prospect of Union United breaking away from the United Church has been discussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t advocate it. That&rsquo;s not a decision that I have to make. It&rsquo;s a decision that the congregation has to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are people who are talking about a parting of the ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gray, who enjoys significant support among parishioners, said he felt his chances of being in the church on July 1 were &ldquo;great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can be with Union outside of the United Church, and that would be all right with me, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the first Sunday of July, I will preach in Montreal somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke to reporters, a few people in the pews called out &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; a few times.</p>
<p>Cynthia Thomas was among Gray&rsquo;s supporters.</p>
<p>She travels from the West Island to attend church service there and said the United Church&rsquo;s handling of the situation is unfair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the United Church really wanted to support him, they can give him extensions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Union United is a community church, she said. &ldquo;And a master&rsquo;s degree is not what is important to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gray said that if he left Union United &mdash; and he hopes it doesn&rsquo;t come to that &mdash; a significant number of people might bolt, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that would be regrettable.&rdquo;</p>
