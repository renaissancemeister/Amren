<h1><a href="https://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=243238&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/">Fifty Children Raped Every Day in SA</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Florence Panoussian, Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg), June 16</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 50 children per day are raped in South Africa as the country struggles with the legacy of apartheid, HIV/Aids and an influx of sexual material into a society which remains somewhat puritanical.</p>
<p>That is according to the official figures, which specialist groups say grossly underestimate the true scale of the phenomenon depicted in police reports.</p>
<p>Regular police reports recount girls as young as five being raped, sometimes by boys who are barely in their teens.</p>
<p>South Africa is notorious for the number of rape cases and, according to Captain Percy Morokane, about 40% of the victims, or 20 000 a year, are under the age of 18.</p>
<p>But according to organisations such as Rape Crisis, the total of all rapes reported, more than 52 000 a year, is far from the real figure which they put at more than a million.</p>
<p>Luke Oambrecht, head of the Teddy Bear Clinic, part of Johannesburg&rsquo;s hospital service which treats young rape victims, says that 91% of perpetrators are people who know the child.</p>
<p>Of them, &ldquo;about 20% are people acting in the capacity of father in other words, the mother&rsquo;s boyfriend, the mother&rsquo;s living partner, the stepfather, the biological father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another 20% are juveniles under 18 years old, other children, which is another worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have younger and younger offenders,&rdquo; Oambrecht added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have heard of seven-year-old boys who have attempted to sodomise other boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oambrecht said one explanation was the country&rsquo;s violent past under the puritanical and repressive apartheid regime of white minority rule, coupled with the rush of sexually explicit material that followed its demise in 1994.</p>
<p>Parents are embarrassed to talk about sex to their children, who do not understand why they cannot practise what they see, he added, while the HIV/Aids pandemic, affecting one adult in five in South Africa, links sex with death, an even more taboo subject.</p>
<p>Other factors are the crowded housing conditions of many poorer people, living in one-roomed shacks of corrugated iron and cardboard, where violence and sexual promiscuity are common.</p>
<p>Social worker Linda Smith commented, &ldquo;Children are sexualised far earlier because of the lack of boundaries and poor living conditions, being exposed to sexual activities and family violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People all live on top of one another, there is a lot of sexual abuse,&rdquo; Oambrecht said, adding that another big issue was poor maternal care.</p>
<p>Pediatrician Lorna Jacklin, one of the founders of the Teddy Bear Clinic, agreed, saying that &ldquo;the only way to protect the children is educating the mothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A typical mother is &ldquo;a very young woman who has no skills, no resources, living in isolation, so disempowered that she is not able to protect her child generally,&rdquo; Jacklin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The level of education of men is important too,&rdquo; rejoined Oambrecht. &ldquo;If they take care of their children, they are less likely to hurt them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But our country is still very traditional, very few men are able to take on that role and violence is still a way of solving the problems, whatever they are.&rdquo;</p>
