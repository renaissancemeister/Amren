						<p><font size="+3">A</font>pril 25, 1996 will mark the 150th anniversary
of the outbreak of the Mexican War. Today, most Americans have been taught
that it was an imperialistic war of aggression, and Mexicans cite the &#8220;illegal
seizure&#8221; of their territories to justify the current colonization of the
American Southwest. In fact, by contemporary and even by today&rsquo;s standards,
the war was far from unjustified.
<p>The conflict began with Texas. When the colony of New Spain broke free
from its European namesake in 1821 and christened itself Mexico, it inherited
vast lands north of the Rio Grande that had been only nominally under Spanish
control. Texas was a remote wilderness, constantly terrorized by Commanches,
with a Mexican population of only 3,500.
<p>Mexico could have concentrated on subduing the Indians and settling
its northern territories. Instead, almost from the first days of independence,
the country was wracked by a series of political upheavals. The small,
predominantly white, Spanish-speaking elite consumed all of its energies
in fratricidal power struggles, while the Mestizo and Indian majority remained
mired in poverty.
<center><img src="/news/2005/06/map.gif" height="329" width="390"></center>
<p>In order to legitimize its claim on Texas, Mexico needed to occupy it.
Since it was unable to do this itself, the Mexican government enlisted
the help of immigration agents or <i>empresarios</i> to recruit settlers
from the United States. The <i>empresarios,</i> chief among them Steven
F. Austin, acted as representatives of the Mexican government. They were
authorized to offer immigrants cheap land in return for accepting Mexican
citizenship and converting to Roman Catholicism. The Americans appear to
have made a good faith effort to fulfill the first requirement but often
sidestepped the second.

The new settlers created a frontier version of the plantation-based,
slave-owning society of the neighboring Southern states. By the early 1830s,
however, Mexico began to fear that the <i>empresarios</i> had been too
successful: American immigrants outnumbered Mexicans four to one, and seemed
likely to identify with the land of their birth.
<p>General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna became President of Mexico in 1833,
and in 1835 abrogated the constitution and declared himself dictator. This
act alone provoked rebellion in seven Mexican states, including Texas,
but Texans had additional reasons for discontent. Determined to reverse
the Americanization of the territory, Santa Anna had decreed an end to
American immigration, abolished slavery, repealed the local political autonomy
Texans had enjoyed, and announced he would forcibly settle the land with
Mexican convicts.
<p>It is hard to imagine policies better calculated to rouse the ire of
free-spirited Texans. In 1836 they overthrew local Mexican garrisons and
declared independence. Santa Anna promptly invaded Texas with an army of
3,000 men, but after several engagements was decisively beaten by Sam Houston&rsquo;s
men at the battle of San Jacinto. Santa Anna was captured, and in order
to gain freedom agreed to recognize Texan independence, with the Rio Grande
as its border. He later disavowed this treaty, and Mexico waged a nine-year
guerrilla war against its former territory.
<p>The United States recognized Texas as an independent republic in 1837,
and recognition soon followed from France, Great Britain, Holland, and
Belgium. Despite strong Texan sentiment to join the Union, the American
government demurred; Mexico threatened war if Texas were annexed, and the
United States was unwilling to upset the delicate balance between slave
and free states.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Western Destiny</font></b>
<p>The presidential election of 1844 brought into office a firm believer
in what soon became known as &#8220;manifest destiny.&#8221; James K. Polk was determined
to complete the annexation of Texas, buy California from the Mexicans,
and bluff the British into ceding the better part of Oregon. The Texans
were impatient for a settlement, and Polk&rsquo;s predecessor, John Tyler, had
welcomed the Lone Star State into the Union three days before he left office.
If the United States had continued to hesitate because of Mexican sentiments,
Texas might have remained independent or even accepted protectorate status
from Britain or France.&nbsp;
<p>As for California, Mexico&rsquo;s position was so weak it was bound to be
supplanted soon, if not by the U.S. then by Britain, Russia, or perhaps
even the Mormons. Polk had reason to believe that Mexico would be willing
to sell. In the meantime, if Oregon joined the Union the careful balance
of free and slave states could be maintained.
<p>When Texas joined the United States in March, 1845, Mexico immediately
broke off diplomatic relations and threatened war. Polk sent General Zachary
Taylor with 2,000 men to protect the new state from Mexican depredation
while annexation was accomplished. Nevertheless, Polk had every reason
to seek a diplomatic solution with Mexico, partly because he was afraid
war might break out with Britain over the Oregon question. He decided to
send a special emissary, John Slidell, to Mexico with instructions to resolve
all outstanding issues.
<p>On the question that had caused the rupture – annexation of Texas –
Slidell was not to compromise. Mexico had been unable to reconquer her
wayward territory, whose independence had been recognized by the major
powers. By refusing to accept the loss of Texas and by persisting in border
skirmishes, Mexico had perpetuated a crisis on the American border that
could have led to European intervention. Texas was now part of the United
States.
<center><img src="/news/2005/06/sword.gif" height="100" width="390"></center>
<p>Several other matters were open to negotiation. One was the settlement
of $3.25 million in claims by Americans on the Mexican government. Mexico
had recognized these claims under international arbitration, but had later
refused to pay. Another issue was final determination of the Texas-Mexico
border. As a Mexican territory, the Texas border had been at the Nueces
River, but after their revolution the Texans claimed the Rio Grande as
the border – without, however, establishing full authority in the disputed
territory. Slidell was authorized to release Mexico from the $3.25 million
obligation in return for recognition of the Rio Grande border. This was
a reasonable offer, especially since Mexico had already, in effect, declared
war, and unpaid international obligations were then considered grounds
for belligerency. By accepting this offer, Mexico could easily have avoided
war.
<p>Besides these immediate questions, Slidell was to offer $15 million
but, if necessary, propose considerably more for the Mexican lands stretching
from Texas to the Pacific. If the entire tract was not for sale, he was
to offer $5 million for New Mexico.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Mexican government, threatened by a militant opposition and wracked
by internal dissension, refused even to receive Slidell. This was a fatal
mistake. The rebuff left Polk with no means to negotiate a peaceful settlement.
He ordered Zachary Taylor into the disputed region between the Nueces River
and the Rio Grande, but he warned Taylor not to seek engagement with any
Mexican troops he might encounter. In the meantime, he made preparations
to ask Congress to declare war, but Mexico forced the issue.
<p>On April 23, 1846, sixteen hundred Mexican troops crossed the Rio Grande.
Two days later they ambushed a U.S. Army patrol, inflicting sixteen casualties
and taking prisoners. Mexico &#8220;shed American blood upon American soil,&#8221;
and the war began.
<p>The Mexicans, of course, saw the war as a just effort to retake what
was rightfully theirs. Why, though, would they make war on the United States
when they had been unable to subdue a breakaway territory? Astonishingly
enough, Mexico fully expected to win. It had a standing army of 27,000
men versus an American army of only 7,200. French advisors to the Mexican
army had an exaggerated estimate of its fighting prowess, which the Mexicans
gladly believed. The generals intended not only to take back Texas but
to annex parts of the United States. Indeed, the Mexican dictator of the
moment, General Mariano Paredes, boasted that he would not negotiate <i>until
the Mexican flag flew over the capitol dome in Washington.</i> The Mexicans
were also counting on diplomatic and even military support from Britain,
but the Oregon issue was resolved just before they attacked.
<p>In his two-volume work, <i>The War With Mexico,</i> Pulitzer prize-winning
historian Justin H. Smith described the war fever among the generals: &#8220;Mexico
wanted [war]; Mexico threatened it, Mexico issued orders to wage it.&#8221; By
no stretch of the imagination was Mexico thrust into an unwanted war by
Yankee aggressors.

Throughout the two-year
campaign, small but superbly led and highly motivated American units consistently
outfought the Mexicans. The Mexican army, impressive enough in numbers
and parade-ground panache, was utterly unable to fight a determined adversary.
<p>The American war effort was not all glorious. Although the Regular Army
behaved with proper discipline, some of the volunteer militia units conducted
themselves so badly they created guerrilla resistance among previously
noncombatant Mexican civilians. Also, the war was all-too-effective training
for America&rsquo;s fratricidal tragedy just 13 years later. Among the junior
officers sent to Mexico, 200 would go on to be generals in the Union and
Confederate armies.
<p>The Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo ended the war in 1848 on terms advantageous
to the United States. Mexico agreed to cede California, Arizona, Nevada,
Utah, and the western parts of Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico – in all,
525,000 square miles of land that contained virtually no Mexicans.
<p>All but overlooked today is the fact that the United States forgave
the $3.25 million debt, and paid Mexico $15 million for the ceded territories.
According to the rules of 19th century warfare, after routing Mexico&rsquo;s
armies and occupying its capital, the United States could have seized territory
under whatever terms it liked. To have paid what it considered a reasonable
amount <i>before</i> fighting an expensive war – estimated to have cost
$100 million – was a magnanimous gesture.
<p>The Mexican position today is that the United States stole Mexican territory.
However, Mexico could have refused the money or promptly returned it. By
accepting payment it ratified the transfer. Furthermore, only five years
later, Mexico agreed to sell an additional parcel of land to the United
States, which was to be used for the southern route of the transcontinental
railway. The Gadsden Treaty of 1853 settled a number of disputes about
the post-1848 U.S.-Mexico border and secured 19 million additional acres
of territory for the United States. In return, the United States paid Mexico
$10 million. There was no threat of war or coercion. This freely negotiated
settlement of the new border and additional transfer of land were further
ratification by Mexico of the consequences of war with the United States.
<p>In conclusion, the United States had ample to reason to pursue, in 1846,
the course that it did. As a practical matter, the real issue decided by
the war was whether Britain, France, Russia, Mexico or the United States
would acquire the vast territories of the American Southwest. President
Polk resolved the question in favor of the United States in a refreshingly
straightforward nineteenth century manner.
