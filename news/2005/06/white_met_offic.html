						<p>Three white officers who were &ldquo;hung out to dry&rdquo; as an example of how non-discriminatory the Metropolitan Police has become have won £90,000 in compensation. </p>
<p>The Met has agreed to pay £25,000 to Detective Constable Tom Hassell, 60, and £32,500 to acting Detective Inspector Paul Whatmore, 39, and Detective Sergeant Colin Lockwood, 55. The men had claimed that they were victims of a &ldquo;witch-hunt&rdquo; driven by political correctness in the wake of the Macpherson Report, which accused the police of institutionalised racism. </p>
<p>The trio were disciplined after Mr Hassell was said to have mispronounced the word shi&rsquo;ites as &ldquo;shitties&rdquo; and &ldquo;shites&rdquo; in front of Detective Sergeant Shabnam Chaudhri, a 40-year-old Asian woman. He also allegedly likened Muslim headwear to tea cosies at a race-relations course in 1999. </p>
<p>Giving its decision, an employment tribunal attacked Sir Ian Blair, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, for &ldquo;hanging out to dry&rdquo; the three officers. The tribunal concluded that Sir Ian had &ldquo;made an example&rdquo; of the officers to prove to the public that racist and politically incorrect behaviour would not be tolerated. </p>
<p>Yesterday Scotland Yard refused to comment on the legal bill for the case, which has been estimated at £75,000. </p>
<p>Mr Hassell, who retired last year, was suspended from duty for three months. His two colleagues were also suspended for failing to intervene after Miss Chaudhri complained of racism. </p>
<p>All three were brought before a disciplinary panel in June 2001 and found guilty of inappropriate behaviour, but the board ruled that there should be no further action. </p>
<p>The tribunal heard that Sir Ian found the panel&rsquo;s decision &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; and sought legal advice about having it overturned. They were later cleared on appeal by Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, the most senior Asian officer at the Yard. </p>
<p>In evidence to the tribunal Sir Ian said he ordered that the men should be punished, but only if the allegations were proved. </p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I knew of the case, this was not an isolated, one-off statement,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was a series of gratuitous, offensive and deliberate statements made in the presence of a member of staff of a particular faith and race.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Ian Pritchard-Witts, the tribunal chairman, ruled that the Yard was justified in suspending the officers during an investigation but concluded that Sir Ian&rsquo;s intervention was unlawful. &ldquo;We take the view, using his own words, that white officers were to be hung out to dry. He prejudiced the matter,&rdquo; Mr Pritchard-Witts said.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Yesterday Mr Lockwood said: &ldquo;It is not just us who have suffered but our families, too. We have had to fight tooth and nail for this compensation and it is a fraction of what some officers from minority ethnic groups have been paid by the Met in other settlements. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This tribunal found the Commissioner responsible for 17 acts of unfavourable treatment based on our race.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In a statement on Monday, the Yard said that it was &ldquo;disappointed&rdquo; with the tribunal ruling.</p>
