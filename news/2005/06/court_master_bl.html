<h1><a href="http://www.hometownannapolis.com/cgi-bin/read/2005/06_17-20/TOP">Court Master Blasts Meade Principal&rsquo;s Handling of Fight</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Hartley, Capital (Annapolis), June 17</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Meade High School administrators botched their investigation of a racially motivated attack at the school in January, failing to protect the victim from a severe beating and hampering the prosecution of the lone student charged, a Circuit Court master said yesterday. </p>
<p>Master Erica J. Wolfe, a judicial officer who oversees juvenile and family cases, said she felt bad for the victim but had no choice in issuing an acquittal.</p>
<p>Before announcing the verdict, she criticized Meade Principal Joan A. Valentine and other school officials in a blistering speech, calling their documentation of the fight &mdash; including written statements from witnesses that didn&rsquo;t have the witnesses&rsquo; names &mdash; &ldquo;virtually useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 17-year-old Meade senior, who is white, was ambushed as he walked down a school hallway during a break in exams, prosecutors said. He was beaten badly, suffering 13 knots on his head.</p>
<p>A group of 10 to 15 African-American students surrounded the Meade High School senior, many jumping up and down and chanting, &ldquo;White boy, white boy, I go!&rdquo; before several started punching him, a prosecutor said.</p>
<p>The attack appeared to be random.</p>
<p>Assistant State&rsquo;s Attorney Michael Bergeson said Principal Valentine refused to give him the names of those witnesses until she was ordered to on Tuesday by Master Wolfe.</p>
<p>Mr. Bergeson, a longtime juvenile court prosecutor, said he&rsquo;d never before had a school official refuse to give him names of witnesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The investigation conducted in this matter was appalling,&rdquo; Master Wolfe said. &ldquo;It is inconceivable to me that anybody who has the responsibility for pursuing this would accept a document that&rsquo;s undated, unnamed, unsigned. The lack of common sense is utterly appalling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The school fails him in not protecting him from the fight in the first place and fails him again in not pursuing it properly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an indictment of the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Valentine, Ms. Sims and the school system official who signed off on their investigation are all African American, prosecutors noted. Mr. Bergeson said the victim testified racially tinged fights aren&rsquo;t unusual at Meade.</p>
<p>Asked whether he thought race played a role in the investigation, Mr. Bergeson said, &ldquo;I have no idea.&rdquo;</p>
