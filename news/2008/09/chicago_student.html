<h1>Chicago Students Skip School in Funding Protest</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jenny Song, AP, September 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 1,000 Chicago public school students skipped the first day of classes Tuesday to protest unequal education funding, a boycott organizers said would continue through the week with help from retired teachers who will turn office lobbies into impromptu classrooms.</p>
<p>The students took church buses 30 miles north to the wealthy suburb of Northfield, where they filled out applications to enroll in the better-funded New Trier district. The move was largely symbolic because students must pay tuition to attend a school outside their home district.</p>
<p>The turnout fell short of the thousands organizers expected, and was a tiny fraction of the more than 400,000 students who attend Chicago public schools, but protesters and their parents said they&rsquo;re willing to keep the boycott going as long as it takes to persuade state officials to give their district more money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Wednesday, boycott organizers will attempt to set up impromptu classrooms at Chicago City Hall and the state&rsquo;s James R. Thompson Center,as well as in the lobbies of more than a dozen Chicago corporations, including Boeing Co. and Aon Corp., that support Chicago&rsquo;s bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Illinois, property taxes account for about 70 percent of school funding, meaning rural and inner-city schools generally end up with less to spend per student than suburban schools in areas with higher property values.</p>
<p>Chicago Public Schools spent $11,300 per student last year. New Trier High School spent $17,500 per student, near the top in the state.</p>
<p>Meeks is pushing for a pilot program that would distribute $120 million to four clusters of schools &mdash; high schools and their feeder schools &mdash; on Chicago&rsquo;s West Side, South Side, south suburbs and downstate. The governor and legislative leaders have made no promises.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe that a child&rsquo;s education should be based on where they live,&#8221; Meeks said. He compared the issue to apartheid in South Africa and said the situation makes it difficult for children to rise from poverty.</p>
<p>&#8220;We undereducated these kids&rsquo; parents, we undereducated their grandparents and now we&rsquo;re in the process of undereducating them,&#8221; Meeks said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the bus ride to the suburban district, volunteers told the children they were taking part in a historic event similar to the bus boycott in Alabama in the 1950s.</p>
