			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dennis Prager, Townhall.com, September 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Seven weeks before the 2008 presidential election, liberals are warning America that if Barack Obama loses, it is because Americans are racist. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} But if Obama loses, liberal rage will focus on millions of fellow Americans and on American society.</p>
<p>And it could become a rage the likes of which America has not seen in a long time, if ever. It will first and foremost come from within black America. The deep emotional connection that nearly every black American has to an Obama victory is difficult for even empathetic non-blacks to measure. A major evangelical pastor told me that even evangelical black pastors who share every conservative value with white evangelical pastors, including pro-life views on abortion, will vote for Obama. They feel their very dignity is on the line.</p>
<p>That is why the growing chorus &mdash; already nearing unanimity &mdash; of liberal commentators and politicians ascribing an Obama loss to American racism is so dangerous.</p>
<p>Andrew Sullivan of <cite>The Atlantic:</cite> &#8220;White racism means that Obama needs more than a small but clear lead to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack Cafferty of CNN: &#8220;The polls remain close. Doesn&rsquo;t make sense &hellip; unless it&rsquo;s race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacob Weisberg of <cite>Newsweek</cite> and <cite>Slate:</cite> &#8220;The reason Obama isn&rsquo;t ahead right now is &hellip; the color of his skin&hellip;&nbsp;. If Obama loses, our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas D. Kristof of <cite>New York Times:</cite> &#8220;Religious prejudice (against Obama) is becoming a proxy for racial prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, in a speech to union workers: &#8220;Are you going to give up your house and your job and your children&rsquo;s futures because he&rsquo;s black?&#8221;</p>
<p>Similar comments have been made by Kansas&rsquo;s Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, a Democrat, and by writers in <cite>Time</cite> magazine. {snip}</p>
<p>Why do liberals believe that if Obama loses it will be due to white racism?</p>
<p>One reason is the liberal elite&rsquo;s contempt for white Americans with less education &mdash; even if they are Democrats.</p>
<p>A second reason is that it is inconceivable to most liberals that an Obama loss &mdash; especially a narrow one &mdash; will be due to Obama&rsquo;s liberal views or inexperience or to admiration for John McCain.</p>
<p>The third reason is that the further left you go, the more insular you get. Americans on the left tend to talk only to one another; study only under left-wing teachers; and read only fellow leftists. {snip}</p>
<p>If Obama loses, it will not be deemed plausible that Americans have again rejected a liberal candidate, indeed the one with the most liberal voting record in the U.S. Senate. Liberals will explain an Obama defeat as another nefarious Republican victory. Combining contempt for many rural and middle-class white Americans with a longstanding belief in the inevitability of a Democratic victory in 2008 (after all, everyone they talk to despises the Republicans and believes Republicans have led the country to ruin), there will be only one reason Obama did not win &mdash; white racism.</p>
