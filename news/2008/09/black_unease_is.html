<h1>Black Unease Is Growing</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gary Fields and Jonathan Kaufman, Wall Street Journal, September 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An anxious murmur is rising among black voters as the presidential race tightens: What if Sen. Barack Obama loses?</p>
<p>Black talk-show hosts and black-themed Web sites are being flooded with callers and bloggers reflecting a nervousness &mdash; and anger &mdash; over the campaign. Monday night, Bev Smith, a nationally syndicated black talk-show host in Pittsburgh, devoted her entire three-hour show to the question: &#8220;If Obama doesn&rsquo;t win, what will you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My audience is upset,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Some people said they would be so angry it would be reminiscent of the [1960s] riots &mdash; that is how despondent they would be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warren Ballentine, a nationally syndicated black talk-radio-show host, added: &#8220;Once Sarah Palin was picked and African-Americans saw the Republicans ignited again, they got worried. We are scared now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black nervousness could help Sen. Obama, the first African-American to head the Democratic &mdash; or any major party &mdash; ticket, by boosting black turnout in November. But if Sen. Obama loses, &#8220;African-Americans could be disappointed to the point of not engaging in the process anymore,&#8221; or consider forming a third political party, said Richard McIntire, communications director for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</p>
<p>{snip} The latest Wall Street Journal poll shows 88% of blacks backing Sen. Obama. Black voter registration has surged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If he loses, it will shake the very ground that we stand on mentally as far as what we need to be to succeed,&#8221; said Robert Gordon, a 48-year-old engineering surveyor from Dallas. &#8220;From day one, we&rsquo;ve been told to be a certain way, to be neat, intellectual, speak clearly. He is the symbol of what we were told to be by our parents and by society as a whole. If this doesn&rsquo;t work, what does that do to our psyche? What do I tell my sons? No matter what the hell we do, it doesn&rsquo;t matter? We can only assimilate so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Melvin Thomas, a professor at North Carolina State University and past president of the Association of Black Sociologists, said black response to the election likely will depend on &#8220;how African-Americans will see a vote against Mr. Obama. What does the racial distribution of that vote look like? If the answer for African-Americans to the question of why Obama lost is race, an Obama loss will have the potential to deepen the racial cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama campaign adviser Valerie Jarrett said the campaign isn&rsquo;t spending its time wondering what happens if the senator loses. &#8220;One of the life lessons I&rsquo;ve learned from Barack is that you can&rsquo;t have a fear of failure. It is debilitating,&#8221; said Ms. Jarrett. &#8220;You can&rsquo;t go into any venture fearful of what will happen if you fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>She recalled that when Sen. Obama lost a House race in 2000, she and others suggested he give it more time before seeking another seat. Instead, he ran for the Senate and won in 2004.<br>
