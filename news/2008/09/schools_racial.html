<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-sanjuan2-2008sep02,0,6078724.story">Schools&rsquo; Racial Makeup Divides San Juan Capistrano</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>H.G. Reza, Los Angeles Times, September 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kinoshita and Del Obispo elementary schools are just an athletic field apart, but for many in San Juan Capistrano, the gap is a potent symbol of an issue that has roiled this south Orange County town in recent years: school segregation.</p>
<p>The schools are on the edge of a middle-class, mostly white neighborhood. But while Del Obispo&rsquo;s students are about 55% white, Kinoshita&rsquo;s enrollment is about 95% Latino. It is a disparity that former district teacher Gia Lugo said highlights the wide gap in race relations in this historic community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new school year begins today, with the ethnic makeup of the town&rsquo;s other two primary schools similarly skewed. Harold Ambuehl, east of Interstate 5, is 67% white, and San Juan, which is across the street from Mission San Juan Capistrano, is 89% Latino.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fifty-four years after Brown vs. Board of Education integrated public schools in the United States and 62 years after Mendez vs. Westminster School District outlawed &#8220;Mexican schools&#8221; in California, segregated schools are still a fact of life in the state.</p>
<p>A 2004 study by the University of California All Campus Consortium on Research for Diversity found that 75% of Latino and 70% of African American students attended predominantly minority schools. The study found &#8220;a trend of school resegregation&#8221; that began emerging during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Race has long been an explosive issue in San Juan Capistrano and its school district. In 1994, white and Latino students at Marco Forster Middle School painted a mural with U.S. and Mexican flags in response to racist fliers targeting Latinos; the mural was intended to promote unity and understanding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In July, Kim McCarthy, whose daughter attends Marco Forster, complained at a board meeting that the school is operated &#8220;as if it is a Mexican public school.&#8221; The campus, with 55% Latino enrollment, is next to Del Obispo and receives students from that school and Kinoshita.</p>
<p>McCarthy also complained about Spanish spoken by Latino students and staff; Latino parents bringing their children on parent-teacher nights to act as interpreters; and the school mural. Supt. A. Woodrow Carter responded to McCarthy&rsquo;s criticisms in a two-page letter in which he defended multiculturalism. &#8220;We cannot ignore our diversity,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Privately, district officials &mdash; many of whom came of age during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s &mdash; say they are troubled by the schools that are mostly Latino. But they say that any attempt to redraw attendance boundaries would spark a backlash from parents, and that Latino and white parents don&rsquo;t want their kids bused to schools across town to achieve integration.</p>
<p>District officials said their goal is to deliver quality education, but that socioeconomic barriers hamper students who live in the town&rsquo;s two predominantly Latino neighborhoods: the La Zanja community, across from the Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano, and an area called Las Carolinas, near City Hall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>American Civil Liberties Union attorney Hector Villagra, who filed a legal motion in 2005 supporting the redrawing of boundaries to integrate San Juan Hills High School, criticized the district for allowing segregation in grade schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More often than not, poverty and &#8220;political choices&#8221; dictate attendance boundaries, UCLA education professor Gary Orfield said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latino parents whose children attend San Juan and Kinoshita have the option of sending them to mostly white Ambuehl and Del Obispo.</p>
<p>Elizalde, former PTA president at San Juan, pulled her daughter out of Kinoshita to enroll her at Del Obispo, where she is a fourth-grader. She wanted her daughter, the youngest of five, to have an easier time assimilating than her older siblings, including the oldest, who is a university graduate.</p>

		<p>For all those people that are racist and want the Latinos to go back to were they came from, ya&rsquo;ll can go to hell because America is a free country and we have just the same right to be here, if not even more. If ya&rsquo;ll want to be racist towards Latinos then ya&rsquo;ll better get used to us being racist towards you. Latinos can go to any schools they want just like white people can, so if you got a problem then deal with it because we are going to be here for a very long time, like it or not.</p>
