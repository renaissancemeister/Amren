<h1>The Real Culprits in This Meltdown</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily, September 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Obama in a statement yesterday blamed the shocking new round of subprime-related bankruptcies on the free-market system, and specifically the &#8220;trickle-down&#8221; economics of the Bush administration, which he tried to gig opponent John McCain for wanting to extend.</p>
<p>But it was the Clinton administration, obsessed with multiculturalism, that dictated where mortgage lenders could lend, and originally helped create the market for the high-risk subprime loans now infecting like a retrovirus the balance sheets of many of Wall Street&rsquo;s most revered institutions.</p>
<p>Tough new regulations forced lenders into high-risk areas where they had no choice but to lower lending standards to make the loans that sound business practices had previously guarded against making. It was either that or face stiff government penalties.</p>
<p>The untold story in this whole national crisis is that President Clinton put on steroids the Community Redevelopment Act, a well-intended Carter-era law designed to encourage minority homeownership. And in so doing, he helped create the market for the risky subprime loans that he and Democrats now decry as not only greedy but &#8220;predatory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, the market was fueled by greed and overleveraging in the secondary market for subprimes, vis-a-vis mortgaged-backed securities traded on Wall Street. But the seed was planted in the &lsquo;90s by Clinton and his social engineers. They were the political catalyst behind this slow-motion financial train wreck.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And the worst is far from over. By the time it is, we&rsquo;ll all be paying for Clinton&rsquo;s social experiment, one that Obama hopes to trump with a whole new round of meddling in the housing and jobs markets. In fact, the social experiment Obama has planned could dwarf both the Great Society and New Deal in size and scope.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a political root cause to this mess that we ignore at our peril. If we blame the wrong culprits, we&rsquo;ll learn the wrong lessons. And taxpayers will be on the hook for even larger bailouts down the road.</p>
