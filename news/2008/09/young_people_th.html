			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), September 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Young people think a steady stream of immigrants is eroding Britain&rsquo;s national identity and threatening jobs, a survey said today.</p>
<p>Almost two-thirds (60%) of the young people surveyed in the poll by the British Council thought the presence of foreign immigrants was &#8220;diluting&#8221; their sense of national identity.</p>
<p>A quarter said immigrants posed a threat to British workers&rsquo; jobs and 12% said they thought the influx of people from abroad was a risk to security and public order.</p>
<p>Two thousand people aged between 18 and 35 were asked about their attitude towards immigration and their sense of national identity.</p>
<p>The survey comes as shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve warned that multiculturalism in the UK has left a &#8220;terrible&#8221; legacy, creating a vacuum that has been filled by extremists.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Grieve said: &#8220;We&rsquo;ve actually done something terrible to ourselves in Britain. In the name of trying to prepare people for some new multicultural society we&rsquo;ve encouraged people, particularly the sort of long-term inhabitants, to say &lsquo;well your cultural background isn&rsquo;t really very important&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told the newspaper that long-term inhabitants have been left fearful, while second- and third-generation immigrants have felt alienated and unsure what British values stand for.</p>
<p>Both the survey and Grieve&rsquo;s comments come on the eve of the Conservative Party conference.</p>
<p>The British Council said the results of this week&rsquo;s survey were &#8220;worrying&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study throws up some interesting reflections, and also some rather worrying results,&#8221; said Paul Docherty, the director of the British Council in Italy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although there are many areas where British and Italian young people have a positive outlook, it is clear that there are stark challenges facing our societies in staying in touch with our younger generation and addressing some of their fears.&#8221;</p>
<p>The survey was split between young people in Italy and the UK and was commissioned by the British Council ahead of its annual Anglo-Italian conference to discuss how political establishments can stay in touch with young people&rsquo;s fears and ambitions.</p>
<p>In spite of greater European integration since the Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1992, just 7% of Britons surveyed said they felt like a European citizen, while 40% considered themselves to be British.</p>
<p>But, while some young people said they felt detached from Europe, over half said they thought the EU helped defend citizen&rsquo;s rights, and 38% said it had a positive influence over the economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The study was commissioned to inform debate at the Anglo-Italian conference held every year, but I am sure that the results will provide a useful point of reference for a number of other programmes in Europe and beyond,&#8221; Mr Docherty said.<br>
