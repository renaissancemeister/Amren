<h1>Iowa Meat Co. Fights Unionization at NY Warehouse</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David B. Caruso, AP, September 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A kosher meatpacking plant in Iowa that was the target of a sweeping immigration raid this year is not the only venue where the plant&rsquo;s owners are locked in a fight over undocumented workers.</p>
<p>Agriprocessors Inc. has gone all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to urge the justices to reconsider their long-held position that workers in the country illegally have a right to join labor unions.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has yet to decide whether to take the case, but if it does, it could have ramifications for a complicated area of U.S. labor law.</p>
<p>At issue are rules that make it a crime for a company to hire illegal immigrants, yet simultaneously protect those same workers from retaliation for engaging in union activity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Agriprocessors fired most of the workers after the vote, saying it had investigated their Social Security numbers and concluded at least 17 were in the country illegally.</p>
<p>The company also refused to accept the unionization vote, arguing that it was invalid because of the workers&rsquo; immigration status.</p>
<p>The National Labor Relations Board sided with the union and took the company to court. The company ultimately gave the workers $2,500 apiece to settle their retaliation complaints, but the dispute over whether the warehouse is now officially a United Food and Commercial Workers Union shop is still unresolved.</p>
<p>A federal appellate court in Washington ruled 2-1 in January that even though a majority of the laborers were illegal immigrants, they were still protected by a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that undocumented workers were covered by the National Labor Relations Act.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is not expected to decide whether to take the Agriprocessors case until later this fall, at the earliest.<br>
