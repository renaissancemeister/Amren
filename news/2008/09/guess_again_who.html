<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=75717">Guess Again Who&rsquo;s to Blame for U.S. Mortgage Meltdown</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Drew Zahn, WorldNetDaily, September 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a nutshell, [writes Stan J. Liebowitz, economics professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, in a chapter of his forthcoming book, Housing America: Building out of a Crisis,] that the federal government over the last 20 years pushed the mortgage industry so hard to get minority homeownership up, that it undermined the country&rsquo;s financial foundation to achieve its goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;In an attempt to increase homeownership, particularly by minorities and the less affluent, an attack on underwriting standards was undertaken by virtually every branch of the government since the early 1990s,&#8221; Liebowitz writes. &#8220;The decline in mortgage underwriting standards was universally praised as &lsquo;innovation&rsquo; in mortgage lending by regulators, academic specialists, (government-sponsored enterprises) and housing activists.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As homeownership rates increased there was self-congratulation all around,&#8221; Liebowitz writes. &#8220;The community of regulators, academic specialists, and housing activists all reveled in the increase in homeownership.&#8221;</p>
<p>An article in the Los Angeles Times from the late &rsquo;90s praised the sudden surge in homeownership among minorities, calling it &#8220;one of the hidden success stories of the Clinton era.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to [John Lott, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland], the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston produced a manual in the early &rsquo;90s that warned mortgage lenders to no longer deny urban and lower-income minority applicants on such &#8220;outdated&#8221; criteria as credit history, down payment or employment income.</p>
<p>Furthermore, claims Lott, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac encouraged and praised lenders &mdash; like Countrywide and Bear Stearns &mdash; for adopting the slackened policies toward minority applicants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Liebowitz&rsquo; contention that lenders were under pressure to loosen their standards for racial and political goals was confirmed years ago by the companies at the heart of today&rsquo;s crisis: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>
<p>A New York Times article from Sept. 1999 states that Fannie Mae had been under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans among low- and moderate-income people and that the corporation loosened its lending requirements to comply.</p>
<p>An ominous paragraph of the article reads, &#8220;In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liebowitz likewise predicted in a 1998 paper the risk of sacrificing sound financial policy for social activism.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the warm fuzzy glow of &lsquo;flexible underwriting standards&rsquo; has worn off,&#8221; Liebowitz wrote, &#8220;we may discover that they are nothing more than standards that led to bad loans&hellip;&nbsp;. It will be ironic and unfortunate if minority applicants wind up paying a very heavy price for a misguided policy based on a badly mangled idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>And though some have speculated that lenders in the &rsquo;90s dove into sub-prime mortgages in an effort to gouge new markets, the president and chief operating officer of Freddie Mac in 1999, David Glenn, confessed his company was pushed by a federal agenda.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mortgage industry intends to pursue minorities with greater intensity as federal regulators turn up the heat to increase home ownership,&#8221; Glenn said in his remarks at the annual convention of the Mortgage Banker Association of America.</p>
<p>&#8220;The federal government in the meantime has increased pressure on lenders to seek out minorities, as well as low-income groups and borrowers with poor credit histories,&#8221; Glenn said. &#8220;Fannie Mae recently reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to commit half its business to low- and moderate-income borrowers. That means half the mortgages bought by Fannie Mae would be from those income brackets.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that same year, Freddie Mac warned of the logical pitfalls of pursuing loans on the basis of skin color and not credit history.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported that the company conducted a study in which it was found that far more black people have bad credit than white people, even when both have the same incomes. In fact, the study showed a higher percentage of African Americans with incomes of $65,000 to $75,000 had bad credit than white Americans with incomes of below $25,000.</p>
<p>Such data demonstrated that when federal regulators demanded parity between racial groups in lending, the only way to achieve a quota would be to begin making intentionally bad lending decisions.</p>
<p>The study, however, came under brutal attack in the U.S. Congress and was ridiculed with charges of racism.</p>
<p>A few years later, when Greg Mankiw, chairman of President Bush&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers, voiced a warning about weakened underwriting standards, Congress rebuffed him as well.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal quoted Congressman Barney Frank, D-Mass., in 2003 as criticizing Greg Mankiw &#8220;because he is worried about the tiny little matter of safety and soundness rather than &lsquo;concern about housing.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
