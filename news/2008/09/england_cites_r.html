<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/sports-soccer/20080911/Croatia-England-Racism/">England Cites Racism by Croatian Fans</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>England asked FIFA to investigate racist chants toward striker Emile Heskey by Croatian fans during a World Cup qualifier.</p>
<p>The Croatian team called the conduct an &#8220;expression of frustration.&#8221; Heskey branded the fans &#8220;ignorant people&#8221; and said he tried to ignore it.</p>
<p>The derogatory chants in Zagreb on Wednesday came after the striker was cited for a challenge on Croatia captain Niko Kovac during the second half of England&rsquo;s 4-1 victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unacceptable for anyone to be subjected to racial abuse and we will be asking FIFA to investigate this,&#8221; the Football Association said Thursday. &#8220;The FA and England team are determined to do all they can to eradicate any form of racism from football and society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croatia spokesman Davor Gavran said the chants were &#8220;in fact very much isolated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They seemed rather an expression of frustration from fans at how the match is going on, than an attempt to insult someone,&#8221; Gavran told The Associated Press. &#8220;We condemn those individual cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croatia was fined $27,600 for its fans&rsquo; racist behavior during a European Championship game against Turkey in June.</p>
<p>Steve Bruce, who manages Heskey at Wigan, called the offending fans at Wednesday&rsquo;s game &#8220;morons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could hear monkey chants and all the rest of it, which I thought we&rsquo;d seen the back of,&#8221; Bruce said. &#8220;But, typical of Emile, he just got on with the game in hand and didn&rsquo;t let it spoil his performance. I think it was a backhanded compliment really as they did it because he was playing so well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three fans, including an unidentified 33-year-old Briton, were injured in brawls before the game, Zagreb police said. The fan was hospitalized after being hit on the head with a bottle by a Croatian fan.</p>
<p>Seventy-eight Croatian fans and four from England were accused of public disturbances and briefly detained before, during and after the game.<br>
