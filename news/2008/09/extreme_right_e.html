<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/29/austria.thefarright">Extreme Right Emerges As Strong Force in Austria</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ian Traynor, The Guardian (Manchester), September 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Austria was shaken by a political earthquake yesterday when the neo-fascist right emerged from a general election as a contender to be the strongest political force in the country for the first time.</p>
<p>The combined forces of the extreme right took 29% of the vote, with Jörg Haider almost tripling the share of his breakaway Movement for Austria&rsquo;s Future to 11%, while his successor as Freedom party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, saw his party soar to 18%.</p>
<p>The far right&rsquo;s vote doubled compared with the last election in 2006, putting it within less than a point of overtaking the poll victor, the social democrats.</p>
<p>The two big parties, which have run Austria since the second world war, slumped to their worst ever election toll. The Christian democrats (ÖVP), fared particularly poorly at around 26%, down 8%. The social democrats (SPÖ), under a new leader, Werner Faymann, took around 30% and laid claim to the chancellorship.</p>
<p>The early election was triggered by the collapse in June of the coalition of social and Christian democrats after only 18 months. The extreme-right profited from popular disillusion with the two big parties, which took months to form a &#8220;grand coalition&#8221; in 2006 and then spent the next 18 months paralysed by internal bickering. The same situation may repeat itself now, with both parties under different leaders and struggling to justify legitimacy.</p>
<p>Faymann, the likely new chancellor, is a 48-year-old from Vienna, who was supported by the main rightwing and fiercely anti-EU tabloid, Kronenzeitung, after he promised to put new EU treaties to a referendum in a country that matches Britain in Euro-scepticism.</p>
<p>The far-right triumph was greater than its breakthrough in 1999 when Haider&rsquo;s Freedom party came second in a general election with 27% of the vote and entered government, sparking a crisis that saw Austria isolated internationally.</p>
<p>Strache, who has been associated with neo-Nazi militants who deny the Holocaust, according to a court ruling, and who wants a new government ministry created to manage the deportation of immigrants, wound up his campaign at the weekend by calling Muslim women who wear the burqa &#8220;female ninjas&#8221;.</p>
<p>He talked of east European immigrants to Vienna as &#8220;European brothers who don&rsquo;t want to be Islamised&#8221;, while another of his party leaders reminisced about the days when the kiosks on Vienna&rsquo;s squares sold sausage and wiener schnitzel, rather than &#8220;the kebab joints selling falafel and couscous, or whatever you call that stuff&#8221;.</p>
<p>Last night Strache said he should be the new chancellor. &#8220;Today, we are the winners of election night,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The only realistic options for forming a viable grouping are for another grand coalition or for Faymann to contemplate a coalition with Strache, a Viennese former dental technician who has supplanted Haider as the national extreme-right leader. Senior social democrats said last night that they would not collaborate with the Freedom party. Any such move would trigger a deeper crisis within the SPÖ.</p>
<p>Despite mustering around 30% of the vote between them, Strache and Haider are sworn enemies and are unlikely to be able to work together. Both men are fierce critics of the EU.<br>
