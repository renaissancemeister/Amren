<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7640176.stm">Rich Flanders Seeks More Autonomy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henri Astier, BBC News, Sept. 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Speed cameras &mdash; hardly popular anywhere &mdash; are a source of particular irritation in Flanders. </p>
<p>More than 1,000 have been installed across the Dutch-speaking northern part of Belgium, while Wallonia, the French-speaking southern half, has only a handful. </p>
<p>Yet revenue from fines is collected centrally and redistributed. Many Flemish motorists not only resent being caught speeding, but feel they are subsidising freewheeling Walloons in the process. </p>
<p>The speed cameras provide a neat snapshot of Flemish grievances. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The hard-working north is supporting the south, just like in Italy,&rdquo; says Pascal Francois, 42, an architect from the town of Aalst. </p>
<p>Flanders indeed has wealth, a hard-working population, and beautiful, world-famous cities &mdash; like Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp. </p>
<p>Many there are asking why their taxes should prop up what they regard as a lagging, mismanaged region. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Walloons should be responsible for what they do,&rdquo; says Roger Vandervoorde, 65, a retired sales director, sipping a drink in front of Ghent&rsquo;s picture-perfect cathedral. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The best would be a confederation, with each part responsible for itself and only a few small matters handled federally.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Deadlock </p>
<p>Such reform is precisely what the Belgian government, dominated by a Flemish conservatives, has in mind. </p>
<p>But the Walloons are digging in their heels. They regard confederation as secession in all but name, and insist on keeping tax and welfare policies at federal level. </p>
<p>As a result Belgium has not had an effective government since the June 2007 elections. </p>
<p>Pressure in Flanders for more devolution is coming from both ordinary voters and business leaders. </p>
<p>Luc De Bruyckere, chairman of the Ghent-based food group Ter Beke and vice-president of FEB, Belgium&rsquo;s main employers&rsquo; federation, says a more regional approach to economic policy is urgently needed. </p>
<p>He points out that Flanders has a very tight labour market, while Wallonia is suffering from 17% unemployment. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to organise ourselves in such a way that the different problems can be answered,&rdquo; Mr De Bruykere says. </p>
<p>&ldquo;One size fits all is not a solution.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Remi Vermeiren, a former chairman of the banking giant KBC, contends that Flemish people &ldquo;believe more in a market economy&rdquo; than Walloons, and argues for outright independence for Flanders. </p>
<p>But resurgent Flemish pride is based on much deeper forces than just material wealth. </p>
<p>The cultural divide between Europe&rsquo;s Germanic north and Latin south has run through the middle of Belgium since the Roman Empire. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a very dual country with two areas that differ in many, many ways,&rdquo; Mr Vermeiren says. </p>
<p>Language problem </p>
<p>The sense of Flemish identity is all the more acute as it was suppressed by the French-speaking elites that ran Belgium after the 1830 revolution. </p>
<p>The constitution was written in French. A Dutch version, written a century later, was not given equal legal force until 1967. </p>
<p>As the Dutch-speaking majority demanded recognition, it was mainly pressing claims against the Belgian state. </p>
<p>From the 1960s &mdash; with the south&rsquo;s old mining and steel industries in terminal decline and the north powering ahead &mdash; a series of constitutional reforms gradually devolved more powers to the regions. </p>
<p>But for all its economic dominance and political assertiveness, the Flemish still feels culturally on the back foot &mdash; and this contributes to their prickliness. </p>
<p>Wallonia may be poorer, but it is part of the 200m-strong francophone community. </p>
<p>The Flemish are not standing on the shoulders of a friendly giant next door &mdash; and can be irked by Walloon cultural self-assurance. </p>
<p>Language is a particular sore point. Like their Dutch brethren, the Flemish are taught from an early age the need to learn foreign languages. Walloons are not. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If we take part in a meeting with, say, eight Dutch-speakers and two French-speakers &mdash; we often all end up speaking French so everyone can understand,&rdquo; says Naima Charkaoui of Minderhedenforum, a Brussels-based umbrella group for immigrant associations. </p>
<p>Suburban fears </p>
<p>Flemish defensiveness is at its sharpest near Brussels. The capital, which used to have a Dutch-speaking majority until the early 20th Century, is now overwhelmingly francophone. </p>
<p>Its population is spreading outward in search of greenery and cheaper homes &mdash; a move that many in the Flemish suburbs find threatening. </p>
<p>Liederkerke, a traditionally working-class town 15 miles (25km) west of Brussels, is one of many suburbs that have seen an influx of both rich expatriates and African immigrants. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That cocktail is leading to Liederkerke being more French and that is growing fast,&rdquo; says town councillor Johan Daelman, who worries about the &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; faced by the city. </p>
<p>The number of families without a Dutch-speaking parent has doubled in the past four years, to reach almost a quarter of the 13,000-strong population. </p>
<p>The town clearly feels the need to remind newcomers where they are. </p>
<p>One sign, featuring the Flemish lion, proclaims: &ldquo;Liedekerke, where the Flemish are at home.&rdquo; Another reads: &ldquo;Welcome to our Flemish commune.&rdquo; </p>
<p>From Mr Daelman, the message is: &ldquo;You can come, but don&rsquo;t bring big-city problems and respect local people.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr Daelman belongs to the right-wing Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest) party, which seeks a separate Flemish Republic. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Belgium will not stay united,&rdquo; he predicts. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a Belgian language or a Belgian nation. You only have Flemish and Walloon people &mdash; plus a few Germans.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Allegiance </p>
<p>Vlaams Belang, widely regarded as xenophobic, is shunned by mainstream parties and in opposition everywhere, including the Liedekerke municipality. </p>
<p>Despite &mdash; or perhaps because of &mdash; its pariah status, the party has achieved considerable success in recent years by attracting protest votes. </p>
<p>It is the largest single party in the Flemish parliament. </p>
<p>However a wide majority in Flanders reject Flemish separatism. Most people just want more autonomy within the Belgian state. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The problem with parties like Vlaams Belang is that they make our job a lot more difficult,&rdquo; says Sam Custers, director of a Flemish cultural centre in Kraainem, another suburb of Brussels. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They create a negative image of Flanders. Our message is: we&rsquo;re open to everyone.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Flemish pride rarely takes a virulent form. French-speakers visiting Flanders are not in hostile territory. The worst risk they might take is not being served until they make a token attempt to speak Dutch. </p>
<p>But even the least nationalist among the Flemish know where their main allegiance lies. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Flemish first, Belgian second,&rdquo; says Pascal Francois of Aalst. <br>
