<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African immigrants have rioted in Spain after a Senegalese man was stabbed to death in the street of a southern town.</p>
<p>Police said the rampage began in the early hours of Sunday, and led to houses and cars being set on fire.</p>
<p>After the 28-year-old man was killed in a fight in Roquetas de Mar, an angry gathering &#8220;degenerated into violence and public disorder&#8221;, a statement said.</p>
<p>Police said they did not know what led to the attack, but they were looking for a local man.</p>
<p>A witness said the man was killed as he tried to intervene in a dispute between Senegalese and Roma (Gypsy) families in the area, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>Rioters set fire to two homes of relatives of the man suspected of the killing, police said.</p>
<p>They also said rioters attacked firefighters with stones, and clashed with police.</p>
<p>There are a high proportion of immigrants in Roquetas de Mar, in the province of Almeria, many of whom work in the agricultural sector.</p>
