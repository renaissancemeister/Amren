<h1><a href="https://newsbusters.org/blogs/warner-todd-huston/2008/09/17/cnns-cafferty-not-voting-obama-youre-racist">CNN&rsquo;s Cafferty: Not Voting Obama? You&rsquo;re a Racist!</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Warner Todd Huston, NewsBusters, September 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To show the empty &#8220;logic&#8221; that Jack Cafferty of CNN employs in his political commentary all one need do is check out his September 16 Political Ticker blog post on why the race for the White House is so tight in the polls. Reason: the country is filled with racists. Yes, folks, if you are voting against Obama (and no matter who or what you are actually supporting and why) it must be because you are a racist. It isn&rsquo;t because you stand against what Obama stands for, it has to be because you are a racist.</p>
<p>This delusional, preconceived notion is becoming the excuse du jour with Democrat supporters that have lately seen a dawning hint that McCain may just win this election. And, that is really all it is, too. {snip}</p>
<p>Here is what Cafferty posted:<blockquote>Will race be the factor that keeps Obama from the White House?</p>
<p>Race is arguably the biggest issue in this election, and it&rsquo;s one that nobody&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>The differences between Barack Obama and John McCain couldn&rsquo;t be more well-defined. Obama wants to change Washington. McCain is a part of Washington and a part of the Bush legacy. Yet the polls remain close. Doesn&rsquo;t make sense&hellip;unless it&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>Time magazine&rsquo;s Michael Grunwald says race is the elephant in the room. He says Barack Obama needs to tread lightly as he fights back against the McCain-Palin campaign attacks.</blockquote><br>
Let&rsquo;s devastate this absurd argument line by line &hellip;</p>
<p>His first line after the initial question claims that &#8220;nobody&rsquo;s talking&#8221; about the race factor in Obama&rsquo;s bid for the White House. {snip}</p>
<p>Since day one it has been claimed that Obama&rsquo;s run for president is an &#8220;historic&#8221; one. Well, what does &#8220;historic&#8221; mean if it isn&rsquo;t because he&rsquo;s the first black man to win the nomination of a major political party to run for the top job? It sure isn&rsquo;t because he&rsquo;s male or a Democrat. {snip}</p>
<p>On top of that, Obama has thrown out the race card dozens of times, himself. {snip}</p>
<p>Now, paragraph two is so free of reason and logic that it boggles the mind. And it serves not only to make his argument absurd, it shows what a failure he is as a political analyst.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then Cafferty, employing his Einstein-like powers of observation, gives us this trenchant analysis:</p>
<p>Yet the polls remain close. Doesn&rsquo;t make sense &hellip; unless it&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>First of all, Einstein, the electorate itself has been closely hewn in half since the Clinton years{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Cafferty&rsquo;s amazement that anyone could possibly want to support McCain is based solely on his assumption that Barrack is clearly 100% right on all points. This assumption is so blindly partisan that it admits not one shred of understanding that there truly is a substantive difference between the philosophy behind Republican thinking and that of Democrats. It assumes that Democrats are all 100% correct in their political philosophy and that Republicans are merely racists for not following along.</p>
<p>Are there people who won&rsquo;t vote for Obama because he&rsquo;s black? Surely there are. Is it the predominant reason that millions won&rsquo;t vote for him? What proof of this is there? Further, there were many millions who didn&rsquo;t vote for Obama in the primaries for the reason that he isn&rsquo;t a woman. Did Cafferty attack every femenazi for their assertion that people should vote Hillary because she was a she and not a he? {snip}</p>
<p>Cafferty completely misses the salient fact that millions of Americans stand against Barack Obama because they feel his ideas are anti-capitalist, anti-military, pro-Eropean policies that pull against American exceptionalism. They see his terrorist pals, his racebaiting pastors, his wife who isn&rsquo;t proud of her country and they wonder why they should vote for such a person?</p>
<p>Cafferty is so blind to the real reasons that people vote the way that they do that he simply blows off the whole closely split political balance with the shadowy excuse of rampant American &#8220;racism.&#8221; This failure of Cafferty&rsquo;s totally discredits him as a political observer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This, in truth, is where Cafferty has ended up. He so hates traditional American conservatism, so despises and discounts the Republican Party that he can&rsquo;t even admit that many millions of Americans hold to those principles and will vote that way because of them. To Cafferty, no one is voting McCain because they adhere to Republican principles, they are just racists against Obama.</p>
