<h1><a href="http://townhall.com/Columnists/DianaWest/2008/09/18/we_are_losing_europe_to_islam">We Are Losing Europe to Islam</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diana West, Townhall.com, September 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} And losing Europe, I would add, is by no means inevitable. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean the continent isn&rsquo;t currently hell-bent to accommodate the dictates of Islamic law, bit by increasingly larger bit. Such a course of accommodation, barring reversal, will only hasten Bernard Lewis&rsquo; famous prediction that Europe will be Islamic by century&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>And what do I mean by &#8220;accommodation&#8221;? Well, to take one tiny example, one snowflake in a blizzard of such examples, there are schools in Belgium {snip} no longer teach authors deemed offensive to Muslims, including Voltaire and Diderot; the same is increasingly true of Darwin. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} According to press reports this week, the British government has quietly, cravenly elevated five Sharia courts to the level of tribunal hearings, thus making their rulings legally binding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a decidedly minuscule minority, I say we ignore the spread of Islamic law across Europe, from the schoolroom to the courtroom, at our peril, particularly given that in so doing, we also ignore the vital political parties that have arisen in reaction to this threat to Western civilization. Why at our peril? Because the same type of liberty-shrinking, Sharia-driven accommodation is happening here.</p>
<p>Of the parties dedicated to resisting Islamization that I examined in Europe last summer, the most promising range from the sizeable Vlaams Belang in Belgium to the tiny Sweden Democrats, and include the Lega Nord in Italy, the Party for Freedom of Geert Wilders in Holland, the Danish People&rsquo;s Party, the Swiss People&rsquo;s Party and the Austrian Freedom Party. Such parties are unknown here, or ignored. Worse, they are shunned. Why? I believe it&rsquo;s because their respective political opponents &mdash; the leftist media and governing establishments that are increasingly dependent on Islamic support, by the way &mdash; have successfully slandered these parties as &#8220;extremists,&#8221; &#8220;racists,&#8221; &#8220;fascists&#8221; and &#8220;Nazis.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} The outrageously empty epithets of the Islamo-socialist left seem calculated to stop thought cold and trigger a massive rejection reflex. In this way, resistance becomes anathema, and Islamic law, unchecked, spreads across Europe.</p>
<p>Does that sound &#8220;Islamophobic&#8221;? You bet. How can anyone who values freedom of conscience, equality before the law and other such Western jewels not have a healthy fear of Islamic law, which values none of these things? Incredibly, this is an emotion that is supposed to be suppressed &mdash; and, in Europe, on pain of prosecution. Indeed, because Filip Dewinter admitted to such &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; in an interview, his party, the Vlaams Belang, has been taken to court in Belgium on charges of racism, and, if convicted, will be effectively shut down through defunding by the government.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, even as Dewinter admits to fearing the Islamization of Europe, he and his colleagues act with exceptional political &mdash; and physical &mdash; bravery in rallying voters against it. This coming weekend, he joins several other politicians on the Sharia-fighting right in Europe &mdash; {snip} &mdash; in Cologne, Germany. In that ancient cathedral city, where the city council recently approved the construction of a long-controversial mega-mosque, these men will address a rally against European Islamization. {snip} The Sharia-fighters expect 1,500 demonstrators. Police expect 40,000 counter-demonstrators.</p>
<p>These are frightening odds &mdash; a metaphor, perhaps, for Europe&rsquo;s chances of staving off Islamic law. Who lost Europe? If it does happen, we certainly won&rsquo;t be able to say we weren&rsquo;t warned.<br>
