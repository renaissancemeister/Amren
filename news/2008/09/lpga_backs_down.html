<h1>LPGA Backs Down on English Requirement</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Doug Ferguson, AP, September 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Under increasing criticism, the LPGA Tour on Friday backed off plans to suspend players who could not efficiently speak English at tournaments.</p>
<p>LPGA Tour commissioner Carolyn Bivens said she would have a revised plan by the end of the year that would not include suspensions for players unable to speak English in pro-ams, trophy presentations or interviews. Fining such players remained an option.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The reversal was quickly hailed by two California lawmakers who challenged the original policy.</p>
<p>State Sen. Leland Yee, a Democrat from San Francisco, had asked the Legislature&rsquo;s legal office to determine whether the English policy violated state or federal anti-discrimination laws. If it was deemed legal, Yee said he would have pushed for legislation banning such policies in California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m very pleased that the LPGA saw the wisdom of the concerns that we raised,&#8221; Yee said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a no-brainer for those of us who have been the recipient of these kinds of discriminatory acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>State Assemblyman Ted Lieu, a Democrat from the Los Angeles area, said he would target corporate sponsors if the LPGA persisted with its English requirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m pleased they have come to their senses,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bivens&rsquo; announcement came two hours before the Asian Pacific American Legal Center planned a news conference in Los Angeles to demand the LPGA overturn its policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until they completely retract it, issue an apology to the players and the fans, I think we&rsquo;ll remain very concerned and interested in what happens,&#8221; said Gerald D. Kim, a senior staff attorney for the center. &#8220;The LPGA has gone about this totally the wrong way.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawmaker said he will continue with his request to the Legislative Counsel&rsquo;s Office, as a way to prevent similar policies in the future.</p>
<p>Lieu said the LPGA&rsquo;s explanation made it seems as though the tour felt it more important to socialize with sponsors than to play golf.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re a sports fan, you should be outraged,&#8221; Lieu said.</p>
