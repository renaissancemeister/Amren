			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Niall Firth. Daily Mail (London), September 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Armed with metal poles, sticks, a screwdriver and even Wellington boots, two gangs of black and Asian youths fight it out in broad daylight on the streets of London.</p>
<p>The terrifying scenes were captured by a photographer who had been waiting in the street to take a photo of the actress Julie Christie, who lives nearby.</p>
<p>Instead he was faced with a brutal illustration of life in modern Britain as gang warfare erupted around him in broad daylight.</p>
<p>In one picture, a gang member threatens another with a screwdriver, while in another, even a Wellington boot is used as a makeshift weapon.</p>
<p>A group of Asians take on a group of Black youths with screwdrivers, spades, metal poles and sticks outside Julie Christie&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>One gang member attacks another with a screwdriver as the two gangs confront one another</p>
<p>Some of the gang members wear masks as they charge down the street waving sticks and other assorted weapons.</p>
<p>The dramatic confrontation took place yesterday afternoon in streets near Columbia Road, in East London, home to the popular Sunday morning flower market.</p>
<p>The battle lasted around 20 minutes and involved at least 10 youths.</p>
<p>According to reports the fight appeared to have its origins in a dispute between a local Asian man and some youths who he had accused of vandalising his property.</p>
<p>Metal poles and sticks are used as weapons as the running battle continues</p>
<p>While the area lies in the heart of London&rsquo;s East End, its terraced houses sell for up to a million pounds each and it is surrounded by fashionable cafes and shops which have sprung up around the flower market.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard said it had received numerous calls about the battle and officers were investigating.<br>
