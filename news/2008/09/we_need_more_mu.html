<h1><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1683635.ece">We Need More Muslim Babies &hellip; Then We Can Take Over Britain</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anthony France and Vince Soodin, The Sun (London), September 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A HATE fanatic has boasted that Muslims will one day conquer Britain &mdash; by having more BABIES.</p>
<p>Speaking at a rally marking 9/11, Anjem Choudary bragged that a birth explosion would let followers of Islam take control of the country.</p>
<p>Undercover Sun investigators secretly recorded Choudary telling a young and impressionable audience that they would eventually rule under strict Sharia law.</p>
<p>And our team listened in chilled silence as he predicted: &#8220;Islam is superior and will never be surpassed. The flag of Islam will rise over Downing Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawyer Choudary also said it would be easy for vast numbers of Muslims to declare Jihad, or holy war, against Britain &mdash; and that every one of them could become &#8220;a time bomb waiting to go off&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Sun team watched vile Choudary, the right-hand man of exiled preacher of hate Omar Bakri, ranting to 100 young Muslims at a meeting in East London.</p>
<p>The mob bayed and cheered as he said: &#8220;About 500 people in Britain become Muslim every day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Home Office say there are 1.5million Muslims but there were 1.5million ten years ago. Since then our brothers in Bethnal Green, Whitechapel and other places have had eight or nine children each. Eight children here, ten children, 15 children. There must be at least six million people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be by pure conversion that Britain will become an Islamic state. We may never need to conquer it from the outside.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>The rally &mdash; advertised as a debate on whether the West had &#8220;learned the lessons&#8221; of 9/11 &mdash; was held amid strict security in a hall above a mosque in Lea Bridge Road, Leyton. Stewards on the door demanded ID from non-Muslims.</p>
<p>Inside the atmosphere was tense as dozens of young men in their teens or 20s packed chairs at the front while the few women present were ushered to the back. Choudary &mdash; whose family live on Â£25,000 a year in benefits &mdash; whipped them into a frenzy with a speech calling for Sharia law, under which criminals and adulterers are stoned or have limbs amputated.</p>
<p>He roared: &#8220;We do not integrate into Christianity. We will ensure that one day you will integrate into the Sharia Islamic law. Our eyes are on Downing Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on: &#8220;That is why the British are so afraid. It would be easy for us to declare Jihad in Britain and each one of us could become a time-bomb waiting to go off. But we are not people who betray.&#8221;</p>
<p>Choudary, who once called for the Pope to be executed and said the 9/11 hijackers were &#8220;magnificent martyrs&#8221;, also claimed without a shred of evidence that 200 Muslim women were locked up in British jails.</p>
<p>Midway through the three-hour rally there was a break for prayers and food. The audience knelt on the floor and free chicken curry and bottles of water were handed out &mdash; but nobody ate or drank until a signal from chairman Abu Omar.</p>
<p>Another hate-filled speaker, Saiful Islam, praised terror chief Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda for their courage in retaliating against the West&rsquo;s &#8220;oppression&#8221;.</p>
<p>He warned of a repeat of the 9/11 attacks in which more than 3,000 died in America, or another 7/7 suicide attack in London. He said: &#8220;The blame of 9/11 belongs to no one but the American government. They are the terrorists.</p>
<p><b>Learned</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Sheikh Osama warned America numerous times, it was because of their own arrogance, because they thought they are a superpower and nobody could match them, that Sheikh Osama taught them a lesson &mdash; a lesson they still haven&rsquo;t learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Referring to Iraq and Afghanistan, he warned the US and Britain: &#8220;Wake up. Withdraw. Listen. All of us have a part to play in stopping the violence or the next 9/11 will take place in Britain, the next 7/7 could take place locally.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meeting was also addressed by law lecturer Abu Saalihah and there was a live webcam link to Omar Bakri at his Lebanon hideout.</p>
<p>Yesterday unrepentant Bakri said he could not understand what moderate Muslims have against Bin Laden.</p>
<p>He also dismissed 9/11 as &#8220;just an event&#8221; which was neither good nor bad but comparable to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Speaking from Beirut he said: &#8220;Osama Bin Laden is a legendary person for Muslims round the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night the meeting was condemned by moderate Muslims.</p>
<p>Iqbal Sacranie, ex-Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Great Britain, said: &#8220;Such outrageous and irresponsible comments are nothing new from the likes of Omar Bakri and his lot. These people know they do not represent the views of the vast majority, if not the entire community, of Muslims in the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night Scotland Yard asked The Sun for a copy of our video showing Choudary and Islam&rsquo;s rants.</p>
<p>The Counter-Terrorism Command will study the footage. Sources stressed they had not launched a formal inquiry but one said: &#8220;We want to see if any laws were breached.&#8221;<br>
