<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSLC7762820080912?sp=true">Mugabe to Keep Major Powers Under Deal</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cris Chinaka, Reuters, September 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Robert Mugabe will keep his job and head the cabinet under a power-sharing deal in Zimbabwe, but the opposition will have more senior ministers than his ZANU-PF party, an opposition senator said on Friday.</p>
<p>Giving first details of the deal reached on Thursday, Senator David Coltart said Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the main opposition MDC group, would be prime minister and chair a council of ministers that supervised the cabinet. The power-sharing deal was reached under the mediation of South African President Thabo Mbeki, who said details would not be announced until a ceremony on Monday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But there was widespread caution among commentators over how quickly the deal could end the crisis or persuade Western powers &mdash; deeply opposed to Mugabe &mdash; to step in with massive financial support to aid recovery.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that Mugabe remains in power as head of state and head of government means the MDC is the one coming into this deal as a junior partner,&#8221; said Lovemore Madhuku, head of the pressure group National Constitutional Assembly.</p>
<p>&#8220;TSVANGIRAI SATISFIED&#8221;</p>
<p>European Union Aid and Development Commissioner Louis Michel said, however, that Tsvangirai had told him he was satisfied.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Investors are already relishing prospects in Zimbabwe if the economy improves.</p>
<p>Shares in Zimbabwe-focused investment group LonZim (LZM.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) were up more than 5 percent early on Friday from an all-time low on Thursday at a time when a deal had looked difficult.</p>
<p>London-listed shares in Mwana Africa (MWA.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) which operates nickel mines in the country, also rose 9.8 pct in the morning.</p>
<p>Coltart, Secretary for Legal Affairs in the MDC faction of Arthur Mutambara, said {snip} Tsvangirai would be vice chairman of the cabinet. There would be two largely ceremonial state vice presidents from ZANU-PF.</p>
<p>In addition, Mugabe&rsquo;s party would have eight deputy ministers, Tsvangirai&rsquo;s MDC six and Mutambara&rsquo;s faction one.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s ruling ANC, also buoyed on Friday by the dismissal of corruption charges against its leader Jacob Zuma, welcomed the deal and congratulated Mbeki.</p>
