<h1>Muslims Object to Christian Prayer Meeting in Oxford Church</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>British National Party, September 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In yet another sign of the increasing Islamification of Britain, a Muslim pressure group in Oxford has demanded &mdash; and received &mdash; an apology from a Christian prayer group which organised a &#8220;Call to Prayer&#8221; meeting in St. Aldate&rsquo;s Church in that city centre.</p>
<p>The Muslim Education Centre of Oxford (Meco) accused Witney-based Christian &#8220;Open Doors UK&#8221; of preaching &#8220;evangelical propaganda&#8221;, despite that organisation holding an indoor meeting in a Christian Church, and not forcing anyone to attend.</p>
<p>Pathetically, Open Doors UK immediately apologised and insisted the prayer meeting had been taken out of context, although it &#8220;regretted&#8221; any offence that had been caused. On the contrary, a spokesman for the Christian group said the meeting&rsquo;s aim &#8220;was to reduce fear of Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meco chairman Dr Taj Hargey said he was &#8220;shocked by their theological self-righteousness. They assume the self-appointed task to &lsquo;pray for Muslims&rsquo;. They also say that each year there are incredible stories about how God answers these prayers, revealing Himself to Muslims around the world, and bringing many to faith in Jesus.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Not only was this evangelical activity ill-conceived and insensitive, it was grossly insulting and inflammatory to Oxford&rsquo;s Muslim inhabitants. At Meco our aim is to bring people of all faiths together, not divide them further. Things like this only serve to break people apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>A joint statement from Open Doors UK and St Aldate&rsquo;s Church said: &#8220;Open Doors and St Aldate&rsquo;s very much regret that offence has been taken by Meco at an event designed to encourage church-going Christians to engage positively with Muslims. Hundreds of Christians responded to an invitation that had been sent to churches to a series of meetings held in a church aimed at &lsquo;reducing fear of Islam, increasing love for Muslims&rsquo;. Thus we would emphasise that it was not a meeting targeted at Muslims. Before the event we emphasised that we were not denigrating Islam or criticising Muslim beliefs. At the same time we do believe that having discovered God&rsquo;s love in Jesus and made a choice to become Christians ourselves, everyone has the right to explore religious faiths and make decisions based on their exploration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incredibly, Dr Hargey said that &#8220;while Meco had been offended, it would not hold a grudge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this what Britain has become? A country where Christians are now browbeaten and criticised for holding prayer meetings in Christian Churches? Where Muslims can demand &lsquo;apologies&rsquo; from Christians simply for practising their religion?</p>
<p>Every day, Sharia law draws nearer for Britain. One day, if this immigration invasion is left unchecked, the new Muslim rulers of this country will outlaw other religions, as is the case in Saudi Arabia and many other countries they rule.</p>
<p>There is only one party which will halt, and reverse this demographic invasion: the British National Party.<br>
