			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Samuel Goldsmith and Jeane MacIntosh, New York Post, September 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>He almost wrecked Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidential dreams, and now firebrand pastor Jeremiah Wright has helped destroy a Dallas church worker&rsquo;s marriage &mdash; and her job, The Post has learned.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Payne, 37, said she had a steamy sexual affair with the controversial, racially divisive man of the cloth while she was an executive assistant at a church headed by a popular Wright protégé.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the time, she was secretary to the Rev. Frederick Haynes III, a longtime Wright disciple.</p>
<p>In April, Payne organized a series of Texas public appearances by Wright, 67. Weeks before, Obama had disavowed his preacher of 20 years after Wright&rsquo;s anti-government rants came to light.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an ironic twist, Wright last night spoke at an East Orange, NJ, church revival on the subject of &#8220;unexpected problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He punctuated his 45-minute sermon with evocative 1960s hits, including the Supremes&rsquo; &#8220;Where Did Our Love Go,&#8221; Frankie Beverley&rsquo;s &#8220;Joy and Pain,&#8221; and the Temptations&rsquo; &#8220;Ain&rsquo;t Too Proud to Beg.&#8221; He&rsquo;s set to speak there again tonight.</p>
<p>Payne&rsquo;s husband, Fred Payne, 64, said he learned of the affair in late February, when he discovered e-mails between his wife and Wright.</p>
<p>&#8220;There must have been about 80 of them, back and forth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Wright said things like he was going to leave his wife for Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wright has been married to his second wife, Ramah, for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>The preacher reportedly wooed Ramah away from her first husband in the 1980s, when the couple came to marriage counseling at Wright&rsquo;s Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago.</p>
<p>After discovering he had been cuckolded, Fred Payne, who had married Elizabeth in October 2006, headed straight for divorce court.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was downright mad about this bull- &mdash;  -,&#8221; said Fred, who said he is &#8220;in the oil and gas business,&#8221; belongs to a hunting club and makes his own bullets in his garage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Rev. Haynes doesn&rsquo;t like the interracial thing, either. This was quite an issue for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Payne said she has been banished by Haynes and the flock at Friendship-West.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not a member of the congregation anymore; I&rsquo;m not even allowed on the premises,&#8221; she said.</p>
