			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail Reporter, September 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Toilet facilities are being built at London&rsquo;s Olympic Park so Muslims will not have to face Mecca while sitting on the loo.</p>
<p>The Olympic Delivery Authority has said it wants to produce an ideal venue for people of all cultures, faiths, ages and abilities for the 2012 Games and beyond.</p>
<p>The Islamic religion prohibits Muslims from facing the Kiblah - the direction of prayer - when they visit the lavatory.</p>
<p>An ODA spokeswoman confirmed that a &#8216;percentage of general toilets would not face Mecca&rsquo; out of sensitivity.</p>
<p>She could not say how many toilets would turn away from the East.</p>
<p>Also as part of the design, special washing facilities will be linked to Islamic prayer rooms.</p>
<p>It is not the first time toilets have changed direction to accommodate Muslims.</p>
<p>Last year, thousands of pounds of taxpayers&rsquo; money was used to ensure toilets at Brixton prison in London did not offend Islamic law.</p>
<p>Muslim prisoners complained of having to sit sideways on toilets so as to not break code.</p>
<p>Faith leaders in the government pressured officials to approve turning the toilets 90 degrees.</p>
<p>But ODA chairman John Armitt said it was about making the London Olympic venue the &#8216;most accessible and inclusive public park&rsquo; for future generations.</p>
<p>Other design measures earmarked for the park include:</p>
<p>* Gentle slopes into the venue with wider pathways with smooth surfaces and seating and resting places at regular intervals for wheelchair users;</p>
<p>* Accessible toilet facilities including special areas where older disabled people can be helped to change by their carers; and</p>
<p>* Baby changing areas and buggy stores at toilet facilities.</p>
<p>Vice chairman of London Olympic Organising Committee&rsquo;s Sports Advisory Group and Paralympic champion Dame Tanni Grey-Thomson said: &#8216;London 2012 is aiming to go further than any previous host city to ensure that both the Olympic and Paralympic Games are accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>&#8216;After the Games, world-class sporting venues and the largest and most inclusive park in London will be left to help inspire a new generation of Olympic and Paralympic athletes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>London Mayor Boris Johnson welcomed the commitment to inclusive design saying &#8216;it is clear that accessibility must continue to be at the core of our work&rsquo; in developing facilities in the Park.</p>
<p>&#8216;I welcome the ODA&rsquo;s commitment to inclusive design and while I&rsquo;m determined to provide taxpayer value from the 2012 budget, that commitment will not be compromised and remains a top priority for me as we prepare London to host the 2012 Games.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The final strategy was based on input from a range of communities, multi-faith groups, disabled people and Paralympians.<br>
