<h1>Fast-Tracking Into Algebra Leaves Many Eighth-Graders &lsquo;Misplaced&rsquo;</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More kids than ever are taking algebra in eighth grade but not necessarily learning more math, private researchers report.</p>
<p>In fact, while eighth-graders are doing better on national math tests, students in advanced classes are faring worse, according to the study being released today by the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study takes a provocative look at a subject many people view as a matter of racial equality. Once unavailable to many minority and poor children, algebra is becoming widely accepted as a must-have for eighth-graders.</p>
<p>Algebra is considered a &#8220;gateway&#8221; course for higher learning. Students who take it that year are on track for calculus as seniors. President Clinton made eighth-grade algebra a priority, and an influential 1995 book labeled algebra &#8220;The New Civil Right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enrollment doubled from 1990 to 2007, when nearly one-third of all eighth-graders were taking algebra. In July, California decided that all eighth-graders should take algebra; Minnesota did so in 2006.</p>
<p>But the study says many kids sitting in algebra class are unprepared. Eighth-grade math scores have dropped for algebra students even as overall scores have improved.</p>
<p>The study was based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, often called the nation&rsquo;s report card. {snip}</p>
<p>In particular, the report looked at low-achieving students. Among the findings:</p>
<p>o Enrollment of low achievers &mdash; scoring in the bottom 10 percent &mdash; has more than doubled in eighth-grade algebra.</p>
<p>o The overwhelming number of low-achieving students are black and Hispanic and attend big urban, high-poverty schools where they are more likely to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>o Teachers of low achievers have less experience, fewer formal credentials and weaker math training.</p>
<p>The study is alarming to some advocates who worry its focus will add to an argument that minority and low-income kids should not take the class. The report&rsquo;s title is &#8220;The Misplaced Math Student: Lost in Eighth-Grade Algebra.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I believe if we stop trying to throw genetics around like it is the end all answer to why all socially contrived groups other than european and asian groups underperform in math such as algebra we can begin to overstand that if you have parents that don&rsquo;t know a thing about algebra, can&rsquo;t help you at all with your homework ( homework being a serious necessity to understanding the inherent repetition and memorization of formula and concepts in math), and are clueless to where to go for help, that you will have students who are recieving education at school but no practice at home. I am not making a case for more spending (so all you penny pinchers stay cool) but just for more overstanding on how complex the truth is and not some deluded fear of impending poverty via goverment spending, dissolving of a culture that is in constant flux anyways (yes america you are a melting pot by your own admission), or the dilution of certain &#8220;pure race stocks&#8221; (as if we were all some breeding experiment) that create twisted and warped views of reality that elicit violence, prejudice, hidden hatred, and general negativity that do nothing more than continue to perpetuate age old myths and folklore that keep one&rsquo;s mind in shackles. <br>
In closing I am an American who is everday realising my love for my birthplace and as such I am endowed with the birthrights of a citizen. I know many here desire for a form of free association that would create segregation and if that is what it comes to I abide by laws as such, just remember that when one has to face the truth and I mean God honest truth, one becomes a thousand times stronger. unity does not destroy is increases.

		<p>I have been an Algebra teacher for seven years.  I have read all the comments and have to agree with some, but not all. Let me set the record straight.  I have had students of all races fail, white, black, and hispanic.  I have had students of all races pull high A&rsquo;s, white, black, and hispanic.  The difference is not in the skin, the difference is in the desire.  Furthermore, while students do not need to have Algebra to go on to a successful career, wonderful marriage, big house, etc&hellip; the skills that Algebra promotes; logical thinking, attention to detail, ability to organize ideas and follow steps, disciplined study time, all help students in other areas of their lives.  In my experience, there are only three reasons students fail algebra, none of which are related to race, they are lack of readiness, lack of homework/practice, lack of intelligence (and I mean in all races).  As a nation we keep trying to put a one-size-fits-all cure on our educational problems.  So, how do we fix this mess?  For students who lack readiness, we quit shoving them into Algebra and do remediation, even if that means we close our eyes to skin color and testing outcomes, and actually worry more about helping whoever needs the help.  Secondly, we hold parents accountable for bad parenting, ie. not making their kid do the homework.  (I have watched perfectly intelligent teens throw away their grades because of laziness and lack of parental intervention.)  This means principals need to call parents in and take them to task over and over again until they are sick of missing work and actually start to parent their kid.  And to the parents who are content to let little Johnny throw his grades away because it is his life, get over yourselves, little Johnny has an F and isn&rsquo;t mature enough to do this without you yet.  Finally, for the students who lack the intelligence, we need other paths of education in this country besides high school to college.  Some of these students are perfectly nice people who could excel at a trade school, if only they were available.  Honestly, this isn&rsquo;t a problem that a little logical thinking couldn&rsquo;t fix.  The politicians are just like bad Algebra teachers, they make it all seem too hard&hellip;If anyone needs me, I will be in my classroom.</p>
