			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John L. Mitchell, Los Angeles Times, September 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Agustiniano [a 35-year-old home improvement store worker] and his wife are stakeholders in today&rsquo;s South Los Angeles and are emblematic of a major trend in the area: a substantial demographic shift. In 1990, Latinos and African Americans each comprised 47% of the area&rsquo;s population; today Latinos outnumber blacks 2 to 1.</p>
<p>But that ethnic transformation is one of the few dramatic changes in an area that for decades has known one constant: poverty. According to a newly released report by UCLA&rsquo;s School of Public Affairs, almost one-third of the area&rsquo;s residents have been living below the poverty line since 1990.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The UCLA report points out that the area is a place of stark contrasts, with solid middle- and upper-class pockets &mdash; View Park and Baldwin Hills &mdash; on the west and communities that lag behind nearly every measure of prosperity farther east. It&rsquo;s most often defined as an area of immense need.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>UCLA researchers returned to the area this year to gather data for the new report, titled &#8220;The State of South L.A..&#8221; The study sought to define 60 square miles &mdash; bounded by the 10 Freeway, La Cienega Boulevard, the 105 Freeway and Alameda Street &mdash; with about 885,000 people, close to 10% of the county&rsquo;s population. Among the researchers&rsquo; findings:</p>
<p>* In 1990, 47% of South L.A. residents were Latino and another 47% were African American. By 2006, the mix had changed to 62% Latino and 31% black, 3% white, 2% Asian/ Pacific Islander and 2% other. About 40% of the people living in South L.A. are foreign-born.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* About 30% of South L.A.&rsquo;s residents live in poverty, about the same proportion as in 1990 and about twice the rate recorded in the county overall.</p>
<p>* In South L.A., fewer residents have skills, high school diplomas and college degrees than in other parts of the county. Unemployment is higher and workers earn less.</p>
<p>* In the poorer sections of South L.A., there are fewer homeowners than the county average and there&rsquo;s a slightly higher default and foreclosure rate. (Foreclosures are much higher in the Antelope Valley.)</p>
<p>* Although property crime rates in South L.A. (27 offenses per 1,000) were roughly equal to the county rate, violent crime was twice as high. More than one-third of the victims of violent crimes were 18 to 29; 16% were under 18.</p>
<p>Over the years, a negative perception of the area has been fueled by its reputation for occasional unrest, urban decline, crime, unemployment and welfare dependency.</p>
<p>In 2003, city officials sought to lesson the negative impact by changing the name of South-Central Los Angeles, but that alteration may have contributed to a loss of a historical identity, the 2008 report suggests.</p>
<p>More harmful has been the persistent lack of resources, such as neighborhood jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a strong recognition that there is a market in South Los Angeles, just like in downtown Los Angeles,&#8221; [Denise Fairchild, chairwoman of the community development department at Los Angeles Trade-Tech College,] said. &#8220;Upper-income people are moving into neighborhoods that were blighted by gang infestation. The urban pioneers are out in force.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We need more services for Latinos,&#8221; [Arturo Ybarra, executive director of the Watts/Century Latino Organization,] said. &#8220;We have families who go to African American community-based organizations for help and they do their best, but we need to create greater infrastructure for services for the Latino community,&#8221; especially in terms of immigration issues.</p>
<p>At UCLA, Gilliam said the job of lifting up South L.A. may fall on many shoulders. UCLA, for example, is one of several partners assisting the Los Angeles Urban League to revitalize a 70-square-block area anchored by Crenshaw High School.</p>
