			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gordon Rayner, London Telegraph, September 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police are investigating race-hate claims after a delegate at a National Union of Students seminar allegedly made comments about black students &#8220;increasing gun and knife crime&#8221; on campuses.</p>
<p>Students were also allegedly confronted with a Bring Back Slavery sign during the training event at York University, leading to a formal complaint by the NUS Black Students group.</p>
<p>One witness has claimed the incidents were merely a prank designed to &#8220;wind up&#8221; the politically correct audience, but police have a duty to investigate any allegation made by someone who feels they have been the victim of racism.</p>
<p>The trouble began during a role-playing session designed to give crisis management training to student union officers from universities across the north of England.</p>
<p>During the seminar, one officer is said to have warned participants against increasing black representation in a fictional university, as &#8220;the presence of such students would increase gun and knife crime and so require more security&#8221;.</p>
<p>Tom Scott, president of York University student union, said: &#8220;There is a lot of political correctness in the union.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were people on the course with strong political views. The student involved was frankly poking people to see if he could get a response which worked &mdash; but I don&rsquo;t think there was any malice intended.&#8221;</p>
<p>He described the slavery poster incident as &#8220;more of the same&#8221;. It was produced during a debate in which a senior NUS official took on the role of vice chancellor of a fictional university being subjected to heckling and &#8220;various comedy protests&#8221; from the floor.</p>
<p>But many delegates were clearly upset by both incidents, leading to the complaint to police.</p>
<p>Mr Scott added: &#8220;It was nothing to do with York University or any officers in our team other than the course was held on the campus. It was about a fictional university, not York, and it was an officer from London who was trying to get a rise out of more sensitive members of the group.&#8221;</p>
<p>The training session was a four-day event for more than 100 student union officers from the North of England to train them in activities like running campaigns on campus.</p>
<p>Wes Streeting, National NUS President, said a full investigation was under way, adding: &#8220;I have received a number of communications relating to allegations both about the behaviour of delegates on the programme, and the actions of senior members of the National Executive Committee in handling problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;It goes without saying that NUS takes the issue of equal opportunities very seriously and I am thus determined that the allegations are handled properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: &#8220;North Yorkshire Police can confirm that we are investigating a racially motivated incident during a student event at York University between 12-15 August.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were notified of the incident on August 22. Inquiries are currently ongoing.&#8221;</p>
<p>No-one from the Black Students group was available for comment.<br>
