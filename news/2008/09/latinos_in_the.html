<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latinos in the U.S. are increasingly pessimistic about their situation and disapprove of aggressive immigration enforcement policies of the Bush administration &mdash; findings that could have implications for the presidential election &mdash; a new survey shows.</p>
<p>Nearly 10% of Latinos said they had been stopped by police or other authorities and asked about their immigration status in the last year, including 8% of Latinos born in the U.S.</p>
<p>Nearly 15% said it had been hard to find or keep a job because they were Latino, and 10% said the same thing about finding or keeping housing. And 57% of Latinos worry that they or a friend or family member will be deported, up from 53% last year.</p>
<p>Half of those surveyed by the Pew Hispanic Center said the situation for Latinos in the U.S. was worse now than a year ago. In last year&rsquo;s survey, a third took that view.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Pew survey found that 66% of Latino registered voters backed Barack Obama and 23% supported McCain, results reported earlier. Those levels mark a swing back to traditional levels of Latino support for Democratic presidential candidates after a groundswell of support for President Bush.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latinos comprise 8% of U.S. voters, but a larger proportion in some key swing states, said Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center: 35% in New Mexico, 14% in Florida and about 12% of voters in Nevada and Colorado.</p>
<p>Pew researchers found that the issue of immigration was playing a more important role for Latinos in this presidential election year than in 2004. Thirty-four percent of Latinos said the issue was extremely important, up from 28% in 2004.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Pew researchers asked Latino registered voters which candidate was better for immigrants, 50% chose Obama, 12% McCain.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Pew survey found widespread disapproval among U.S.- and foreign-born Latinos for immigration enforcement methods such as workplace raids and criminal prosecution of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>One significant difference between U.S.-born and foreign-born Latinos came on the question of electronically verifying workers&rsquo; legal status. Overall, 53% disapproved. But 63% of foreign-born Latinos disapproved of the policy, whereas 38% of U.S.-born Latinos were against it.</p>
