<h1><a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08266/914029-298.stm">Eyebrows Raised Over City School Policy That Sets 50% As Minimum Score</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Smydo, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, September 22, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools officials say they want to give struggling children a chance, but the district is raising eyebrows with a policy that sets 50 percent as the minimum score a student can receive for assignments, tests and other work.</p>
<p>The district and teachers union last week issued a joint memo to ensure staff members&rsquo; compliance with the policy, which was already on the books but enforced only at some schools. Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers President John Tarka said the policy is several years old.</p>
<p>While some districts use &#8220;F&#8221; as a failing grade, the city uses an &#8220;E.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The &lsquo;E&rsquo; is to be recorded no lower than a 50 percent, regardless of the actual percent earned. For example, if the student earns a 20 percent on a class assignment, the grade is recorded as a 50 percent,&#8221; said the memo from Jerri Lippert, the district&rsquo;s executive director of curriculum, instruction and professional development, and Mary VanHorn, a PFT vice president.</p>
<p>In each subject, a student&rsquo;s percentage scores on tests and other work are averaged into a grade for each of the four marking periods. Percentages for marking periods later are averaged into semester and year-end grades.</p>
<p>A student receives an &#8220;A&#8221; for scores ranging from 100 percent to 90 percent, a &#8220;B&#8221; for scores ranging from 89 percent to 80 percent, a &#8220;C&#8221; for scores ranging from 79 percent to 70 percent, a &#8220;D&#8221; for scores ranging from 69 percent to 60 percent and an &#8220;E&#8221; for scores ranging from 59 percent to the cutoff, 50 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, they said, the 50 percent minimum gives children a chance to catch up and a reason to keep trying. If a student gets a 20 percent in a class for the first marking period, Ms. Pugh said, he or she would need a 100 percent during the second marking period just to squeak through the semester.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to create situations where students can recover and not give up,&#8221; she said, adding a sense of helplessness can lead to behavior and attendance problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not grade inflation. We&rsquo;re not saying, &lsquo;Give people passing grades,&rsquo; &#8221; Ms. Pugh said.</p>
<p>But the policy strikes some teachers and parents as rewarding bad work and at odds with the district&rsquo;s &#8220;Excellence for All&#8221; improvement campaign.</p>
