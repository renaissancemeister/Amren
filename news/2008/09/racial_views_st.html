<h1>Racial Views Steer Some White Dems Away From Obama</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, September 20, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Deep-seated racial misgivings could cost Barack Obama the White House if the election is close, according to an AP-Yahoo News poll that found one-third of white Democrats harbor negative views toward blacks &mdash; many calling them &#8220;lazy,&#8221; &#8220;violent&#8221; or responsible for their own troubles.</p>
<p>The poll suggests that the percentage of voters who may turn away from Obama because of his race could easily be larger than the final difference between the candidates in 2004 &mdash; about two and one-half percentage points.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than a third of all white Democrats and independents &mdash; voters Obama can&rsquo;t win the White House without &mdash; agreed with at least one negative adjective about blacks, according to the survey, and they are significantly less likely to vote for Obama than those who don&rsquo;t have such views.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot fewer bigots than there were 50 years ago, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s only a few bigots,&#8221; said Paul Sniderman, a political scientist at Stanford University, which partnered with The Associated Press and Yahoo News to conduct the exhaustive poll and analysis.</p>
<p>The pollsters set out to determine why Obama is locked in a close race with McCain even as the political landscape seems to favor Democrats. President Bush&rsquo;s unpopularity, the Iraq war and a national sense of economic hard times cut against GOP candidates, as does that fact that Democratic voters outnumber Republicans.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that Obama&rsquo;s problem is close to home &mdash; among his fellow Democrats, particularly non-Hispanic white voters. Just seven in 10 people who call themselves Democrats support Obama, compared to the 85 percent of self-identified Republicans who back McCain.</p>
<p>The survey also focused on the racial attitudes of independent voters because they are likely to decide the election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not all whites are prejudiced. Indeed, more whites say good things about blacks than say bad things, the poll shows. And many whites who see blacks in a negative light are still willing or even eager to vote for Obama.</p>
<p>On the other side of the racial question, the Illinois Democrat is drawing almost unanimous support from blacks, the poll shows, though that probably wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to counter the negative effect of some whites&rsquo; views.</p>
<p>Race is not the biggest factor driving Democrats and independents away from Obama. Doubts about his competency loom even larger, the poll indicates. More than a quarter of all Democrats expressed doubt that Obama can bring about the change they want, and they are likely to vote against him because of that.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Statistical models derived from the poll suggest that Obama&rsquo;s support would be as much as 6 percentage points higher if there were no white racial prejudice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The AP-Yahoo poll used the unique methodology of Knowledge Networks, a Menlo Park, Calif., firm that interviews people online after randomly selecting and screening them over telephone. Numerous studies have shown that people are more likely to report embarrassing behavior and unpopular opinions when answering questions on a computer rather than talking to a stranger.</p>
<p>Other techniques used in the poll included recording people&rsquo;s responses to black or white faces flashed on a computer screen, asking participants to rate how well certain adjectives apply to blacks, measuring whether people believe blacks&rsquo; troubles are their own fault, and simply asking people how much they like or dislike blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We still don&rsquo;t like black people,&#8221; said John Clouse, 57, reflecting the sentiments of his pals gathered at a coffee shop in Somerset, Ohio.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among white independents, racial stereotyping is not uncommon. For example, while about 20 percent of independent voters called blacks &#8220;intelligent&#8221; or &#8220;smart,&#8221; more than one third latched on the adjective &#8220;complaining&#8221; and 24 percent said blacks were &#8220;violent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearly four in 10 white independents agreed that blacks would be better off if they &#8220;try harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just 59 percent of her white Democratic supporters said they wanted Obama to be president. Nearly 17 percent of Clinton&rsquo;s white backers plan to vote for McCain.</p>
<p>Among white Democrats, Clinton supporters were nearly twice as likely as Obama backers to say at least one negative adjective described blacks well, a finding that suggests many of her supporters in the primaries &mdash; particularly whites with high school education or less &mdash; were motivated in part by racial attitudes.</p>
<p>The survey of 2,227 adults was conducted Aug. 27 to Sept. 5. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points.<br>
