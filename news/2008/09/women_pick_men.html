<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7593336.stm">Women Pick Men Who Look Like Dad</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, September 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Women tend to choose husbands who look like their fathers, a study shows.</p>
<p>And it works both ways &mdash; the women in the Proceedings B study also resembled their partner&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>The latest work from the University of PÃ©cs in Hungary provides yet more evidence for the phenomenon, known as sexual imprinting.</p>
<p>Others have shown women use dads as a template for picking a mate even if they are adopted, suggesting imprinting is led by experience not simply genes.</p>
<p>This notion is backed by other work showing the imprinting link is lost on women who did not have good relationships with their fathers.</p>
<p>The Hungarian team measured the facial proportions of the members of 52 families.</p>
<p>They found significant correlations between the young men and their fathers-in-law, especially on facial proportions belonging to the central area of face &mdash; nose and eyes.</p>
<p>Women also showed resemblance to their mothers-in-law in the facial characteristics of their lower face &mdash; lips and jaw.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Tamas Bereczkei said: &#8220;Our results support the sexual imprinting hypothesis which states that children shape a mental template of their opposite-sex parents and search for a partner who resembles that perceptual schema.&#8221;</p>
<p>Familiarity alone does not appear to account for choosing a partner because the participants did not adopt templates for their same-sex parents, they said.</p>
<p>They say males and females choose different facial areas of parents to be models in accordance with their general sexual preferences for facial traits.</p>
<p>Experts say there may be an advantage to selecting a mate somewhat similar to themselves genetically.</p>
<p>Dr Lynda Boothroyd from the University of Durham, a psychologist who has carried out similar research, said: &#8220;There is an argument that a certain degree of similarity makes people more fertile and genetically compatible.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there is a balance between the benefits of marrying someone genetically close and the risks of inbreeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of mechanisms &mdash; such as pheromones and smell &mdash; to stop us choosing someone too similar to us, like an immediate family member,&#8221; said Dr Boothroyd.<br>
