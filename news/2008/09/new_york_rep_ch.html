<h1>New York Rep. Charles Rangel Failed To Include $75,000 In Tax Returns, Report says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kris Alingod, AHN News (Wellington, Florida), September 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Another report from the New York Times has added to the controversy surrounding Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY), who faced the threat of a censure some weeks ago for &#8220;dishonoring himself and bringing discredit to the House.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Times said on Thursday Rangel had failed to report more than $75,000 in income on his tax returns. The congressman had allegedly earned the money from a villa at the Punta Cana Yacht Club in the Dominican Republic which he rents out for $500 or more per night.</p>
<p>Rangel bought the property in 1988. Profits from the villa ranged from $7,600 in 1994 to $2,700 in 2004. His attorney, Lanny Davis, told the Times the lawmaker would likely make changes to his tax returns to include income from the villa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rangel, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, had to give up one of four rent-stabilized apartments in July after a Times report said he had been enjoying below-market rates for the apartments in spite of aggressive evictions of less influential tenants. {snip}</p>
<p>But the congressman was beleaguered again by controversy after a July 15 Washington Post report accused him of inappropriately soliciting donations from businesses and foundations using the congressional letterhead. The contributions were for the Rangel Center at City College in New York.</p>
