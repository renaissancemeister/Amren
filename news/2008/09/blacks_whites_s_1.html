<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20080928/The.Racial.Divide/">Blacks, Whites Show Prejudices Along Racial Divide</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, September 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But when it comes to race, what is understood? And what is misunderstood?</p>
<p>And how can it be that in 2008 &mdash; 143 years after slavery was abolished, decades after the civil rights movement &mdash; an AP-Yahoo News poll could find that racial misgivings could cost Sen. Barack Obama the election?</p>
<p>In search of explanations, two Associated Press reporters &mdash; one black, one white &mdash; listened to people of both races along Detroit&rsquo;s divides: Alter Road, which separates the city from the tony Grosse Pointes near Lake St. Clair, and 8 Mile Road, the vast northern border between a mostly black Detroit and its mostly white suburbs.</p>
<p>They found people of both races living just blocks apart who nonetheless spoke of each other like strangers. There was suspicion, contempt &mdash; and yet, for many, a desperate hope that Obama&rsquo;s candidacy might be the final step in America&rsquo;s long path to racial equality. For whites, their support of Democratic economic policies forces them to confront their racial prejudices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whites say their neighbors consider blacks to be violent and solely responsible for problems in the black community.</p>
<p>Blacks say many of their own consider whites to be spoiled and condescending.</p>
<p>But nobody &mdash; well, hardly anybody &mdash; acknowledged their own prejudices. Both blacks and whites instead blamed &#8220;they,&#8221; a vague and unaccountable surrogate for their own racial attitudes.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8221; are whites who say Obama is unqualified when they really mean he&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8221; are blacks who say all whites are bigots.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Four of every 10 white Americans hold at least a partly negative view toward blacks, calling them &#8220;lazy,&#8221; or &#8220;violent&#8221; or blaming them for the ills of black America, according to the AP-Yahoo poll. Such surveys draw criticism from whites who say the numbers are exaggerated and from blacks who say the numbers are too low.</p>
<p>Let others argue about the math. Listen while the people of Detroit explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;My kids have been called nigger babies&hellip;&nbsp;. That was from a white family,&#8221; says Cherlonda Hampton, a black woman shopping at an outdoor mall on 8 Mile Road.</p>
<p>A petite mother of nine who looks half her 37 years, Hampton says she was harassed by whites while living in suburban Detroit. Feces were smeared on her car. A dead bird was left on a tire. When her child was bitten by a white classmate, the white principal didn&rsquo;t seem to care.</p>
<p>After a year, Hampton returned to her segregated Detroit neighborhood.</p>
<p>This is an apt place to talk about race in America. Detroit&rsquo;s population peaked at nearly 2 million in the 1950s and has been on the decline ever since, dropping to less than 1 million in the latest Census figures. Although racial tension isn&rsquo;t the only cause, the 1967 race riots hastened Detroit&rsquo;s decline and mandatory school busing a decade later stoked unrest.</p>
<p>Coleman A. Young, the city&rsquo;s first black mayor and a racially polarizing figure, said before his 1997 death, &#8220;No other city in America, no other city in the Western world has lost the population at that rate. And what&rsquo;s at the root cause of that loss? Economics and race. Or should I say, race and economics?&#8221;</p>
<p>White working-class Detroiters fled the city in droves, many to Macomb County and its working-class suburbs north of 8 Mile Road. Detroit&rsquo;s white-flighters were among the first to be dubbed &#8220;Reagan Democrats&#8221; &mdash; socially conservative, economically progressive, mostly Catholic voters who abandoned the Democratic Party for the GOP, in part because Republicans exploited their racial fears.</p>
<p>Their children and grandchildren are just as politically independent &mdash; swing voters in a swing county that both Obama and Republican John McCain hope to carry en route to winning Michigan.</p>
<p>And, like the Reagan Democrats of a generation ago, whites in Macomb County today aren&rsquo;t sure whether to vote their pocketbooks or their prejudices.</p>
