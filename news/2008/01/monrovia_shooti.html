						<p>Investigators say a racially charged gang war may be responsible for the shootings of two innocent teenage girls in Monrovia over the weekend. One of the girls died. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Detectives tell Eyewitness News that two African-American members of a notorious Monrovia gang walked up to Salas and her girlfriend and opened fire as the girls stood outside Salas&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; apartment community in the 2500 block of Peck Road in unincorporated Monrovia. Salas was killed. Her friend was injured. </p>
<p>Homicide investigators say so far in their investigation, they believe the black gang members entered turf belonging to a rival Hispanic gang and in an act of retaliation, targeted the teens simply because they were there. </p>
<p>&ldquo;From all indications, this girl was a truly innocent victim in this thing,&rdquo; said L.A. County Homicide Detective Sgt. Edward Godfrey. &ldquo;[She] was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that&rsquo;s the tragic part about it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Detectives say since the first of the year, a violent war between black and Hispanic gangs has escalated in Monrovia and in neighboring cities. </p>
<p>Nearly two weeks ago, authorities say members of a Hispanic gang shot an elderly man outside of his Monrovia home. </p>
<p>Investigators say there have been numerous shootouts between the rivals. In one case, they say a boy riding his bike was injured by gang gunfire. </p>

			<p>How can standing on the sidewalk outside of your parents&rsquo; home be the wrong place?  I just wish these animals had the guts to kill members of enemy gangs instead of teen aged girls and old men.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Strangely enough when the various different European nationalities heavily emigrated to the USA in the late 19th to early 20th centuries, there was very little sign of an impending ethnic civil war -which is the case now between blacks and Mexicans - despite the Europeans differing markedly and often nursing ancient hatreds.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because our white ancestors were intelligent enough to realize that as far as America was concerned the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, whereas the dark-skinned minorities are not intelligent enough to realize this and they will forever be slaves of a tribal mentality they can never rise above&hellip;            </p>

			<p>how come when blacks and hispanics are racially attacked, it&rsquo;s headline news, yet not one peep about the millions of whites that have been raped, murdered, and beaten since integration.  Amazing</p>

			<p>This is why Obama is not going to do well in the California primary. The black population in California is only six percent of the total. Now place your bets.</p>
<p>*They always select the vulnerable and unsuspecting, which is why despite their macho posturing, they come off looking like nothing more than cowards. It&rsquo;s also true that Blacks are vastly outnumbered by Hispanics, and if anything, the black population is shrinking there not growing. But just as Hispanics are fanning out across the US in states other than California, so to are these black-brown wars*</p>

			<p>Blacks are being chased by Hispanics from communities, that blacks originally chased whites from. Meanwhile, Asian, are seeking their own communities, while whites keep looking for a new safe harbor, as white flight becomes more and more impossible. While social engineers keep trying to brain-wash the masses into believing that diversity is our strength.</p>

<p>I live in California.  Most of the Whites are mentally ill liberals who worship anything black.  Many of the Whites, including the White men will vote for Obama.  I hear conversations at Starbucks, bars, bookstores, movie lines, malls.  On and on rich Whites young and old talking about how wonderful Obama is.  I see many White men wearing Obama T shirts.  I see White women with Obama signs on their cars.  I see Obama stickers in the front gardens of the affluent White neighborhoods.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Anonymous at 8:52 let me venture a guess that, in the unwritten/ unspoken history of the Caribbeans a major factor in the depopulation of native Indians, and their replacement by blacks, was violence perpetrated by said blacks on the Indians. &hellip;&#8221; Posted by jewamongyou at 12:35 AM on January 31</p>
<p>You make an excellent point, brother. This has been amply displayed over the past millennia where African blacks expanded out from their original rather limited area in West Africa and systematically exterminated the Pygmies and the Bushmen, the original inhabitants of most of sub-Sahara Africa, and stole their land. The process continues to this day. The dwindling number of Pygmies and Bushmen are relegated to ever diminishing patches of the most inhospitable barren land as Bantu black Africans continue to slaughter them and grab their land.</p>

<p>Wrong! You have it completely backwards.The most intelligent people on earth are extremely tribal and extremely racially selfish.  Whites are in the predicament they are in precisely because they are not intelligent enough to be &#8220;tribal.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This is just primal fear of Whites realizing that they are losing everything, they once held so dearly. The people of color is a growing force to be reckoned with. While the white MINORITY is becoming an eye opening reminder of the truth. Look at Denmark, Germany, Sweden, UK, the Netherlands and on and on.<br>
These govt. have the power to deny visa statuses or amnesty to these foreigners, but they don`t. So instead of blaming the the MAJORITY, go and raise these issues with your heads of state, show them your discontent. But all in all, it not help, not in the slightest. Just like evolution, this is the ultimate fate of the world. It will happen, it is inevitable.  Just accept it.</p>
