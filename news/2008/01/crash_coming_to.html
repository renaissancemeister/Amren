			<p><b>Question</b>: Which major ethnic group in Los Angeles was not even mentioned in the movie, never mind depicted in an inter-racial quarel?<br>

			<p>The series will most likely show White-tee doing a lot of bad things to Black-kee, and it will generate a lot of black on white racial hate crimes.All of the anti white propaganda shown on television is the single leading cause of black on white hate crimes. Children of all races spend more time in front of the idiot box/boob tube than they do in the class room, and that is not an exaggeration.Before television, racial hate crimes were much lower.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The movie was an examination of the complexities of racial tolerance set in Los&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Complexities of racial tolerance&rsquo;? I thought that that was blacks robbing/raping/assaulting/murdering whites, then blaming &#8220;Whitey&#8221;, while the LibMed ensures us that &#8220;blacks can&rsquo;t be racist&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Actually they are about 6 years too late.On F/X there was a show called THE SHIELD. It dealt very honestly with the race issue in Las Angeles.It in fact predicted that balcks and latinos would be at each other throats.The show even exposed the problem between Black,White and Hispanic policemen.</p>

			<p>Ah, perhaps it will be as inherently idiotic as the movie. Suppose if they actually followed the racial demographics of LA; rampant Hispanic on Black murder and all. Lovely!</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many people on here actually saw the movie, I know it isn&rsquo;t most people on here&rsquo;s forte&rsquo;, but it was actually kind of realistic, with the exception of the over portrayal of Whites as evil, and the under representation of racial conflicts with non-White hispanics. </p>

<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t see it.  And in case it&rsquo;s news to you, &#8220;the over portrayal of Whites as evil&#8221; is one of the things that were all rather sick of around here.  So forgive us for not wanting to see the movie.</p>
<p>Popular entertainments, for the most part, are the deluded fantasies of New York and Hollywood writers, directors, and producers, who live in a world that is unrecognizable to those of us who live in, and observe, the real one.  They live in the world where:</p>
<p>Small towns in Maine have black sherrifs deputies and hardware store clerks.</p>
<p>The FBI, and other government agencies, have lone-wolf,  go-it-alone, not-by-the-book, guys - guys who aren&rsquo;t organization men, and who routinely piss off their bosses&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..rather than time-serving hacks, who never make waves, and who are counting the days until retirement.</p>
<p>New York City has both active neo-nazi groups and fundamentalist christian abortion-clinic bombers.</p>
<p>A huge fraction of all scientists and computer programmers are black.</p>
<p>American Indians never touch liquor, ever.</p>
<p>All devout christian clergymen are sexual deviants, while promiscuous homosexuals never frequent bathhouses.</p>
<p>White guys can&rsquo;t dance (Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, call your agents).</p>
<p>Jocks and cheerleaders are always evil, while nerdy girls and bad-boy misfit types are always good (Dylan Klebold, call YOUR agent&hellip;&hellip;in Hell).</p>
<p>This is reality as Hollywood depicts it.</p>

			<p>Oh yeah. This will examine the legacy of racism. Institutional racism. White privilege.<br>
What it won&rsquo;t examine is the high rate of crime committed by blacks, their special privileges in college admissions and jobs, and White guilt.</p>

This is propaganda pure and simple. It&rsquo;s just another way to generate perpetual myths of blacks being victims of white &#8216;racism&rsquo; and white &#8216;supremacy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What the media won&rsquo;t do is present art based on reality. &#8216;ART&rsquo; is driving distorted perceptions. </p>

			<p>What I liked about that movie the best - was the fact that it showed that blacks can be intolerant as well.  Something that is usually covered up and lied about by our politicians and media.  All we ever hear is how minorities can&rsquo;t be racist.  What a joke!</p>

			<p>There was another movie like <i>Crash</i> called <i><a href="/" rel="nofollow">Race</a></i>, starring the extremely unfunny Paul Rodriguez. Predictably, it turned out at the end that it was some evil white guy manipulating all the noble minorities and keeping them at each other&rsquo;s throats. A good way to kill an afternoon, if you want to recon some blatant anti-white propaganda. Make sure you don&rsquo;t eat first, though.</p>
<p>IIRC, the movie bombed, as it deserved to. </p>

			<p>Hah! Reminds me a bit of &#8220;Deep Impact.&#8221; Terrible movie, but it was very entertaining to see the President and the entire Cabinet, played by black men. They even put them in little suits&hellip; Hilarious.</p>

			<p>Watch for Haggis to knuckle under and make the show about bashing whitey, and only whitey (other than giving illegal aliens a total pass, <i>Crash</i> was about as balanced a film as Hollywood has ever produced.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The shooter  &mdash;  described by a witness as a stocky man in a dark knit cap and dark jacket  &mdash;  was seen leaving the scene but police are yet to find him. Tinley Park Police Sgt. T.J. Grady said police were &ldquo;pretty sure&rsquo;&rsquo; he acted alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice the description. That could refer to Santa off duty.  The very fact that they try to down play the race factor is evidence enough of the gravity of the situation.  If the entire nation were to know the truth about Black on White crime, the long hoped for uprising would take place tomorrow.</p>
