						<p>England is poised to become the most crowded nation in Europe, according to official figures.</p>
<p>The number of people crammed into each square mile is due to overtake levels in Holland and Belgium &mdash; and may already have done so.</p>
<p>Large-scale immigration is pushing up demand in the South of England for more homes, more transport and more services.</p>
<p>The new evidence of increasing population density brought charges from the Tories that ministers have been ignoring the risks of overcrowding.</p>
<p>The figures were released by the Office for National Statistics in a Commons written answer.</p>
<p>They show that in England in 2005 there were 387 people for every square kilometre, and this rose to 390 per square kilometre in 2006.</p>
<p>This is around 620 per square mile.</p>
<p>At that rate England will now have overtaken the most crowded major country in Europe, Holland, which had 393 people for every square kilometre in 2005.</p>
<p>Its population is growing at a much slower rate than Britain because of the higher immigration levels in this country.</p>
<p>By 2031, the ONS forecasts, England will have 464 people per square kilometre.</p>
<p>Around 70 per cent of population growth is a result of immigration, and much of the rest is accounted for by higher birthrates among recent immigrants.</p>
<p>The most crowded country in Europe, according to the statistics, is Malta.</p>
<p>But Malta is a small island with only 400,000 citizens, most of whom live in and around the city of Valletta.</p>
<p>Crowding in England is almost double that of Germany and quadruple the population density in France.</p>
<p>The figures are likely to increase concern over Labour&rsquo;s plans to build hundreds of thousands of homes, mainly in southern England.</p>
<p>The homes are needed to cope with the increasing population and there are fears that many will end up on green belt land that is currently protected.</p>
<p>Tory MP James Clappison, whose questioning secured the release of the figures, said: &#8220;These figures show that England, if not the most crowded already, will very soon be so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immigration is a substantial factor leading to greater population density.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;This is more evidence of the impact of immigration, and if present patterns of migration continue we are going to get much more crowded. There will be a big impact on quality of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the factors fuelling immigration to Britain is a benefits system discouraging British workers from taking low-paid jobs, a report warns.</p>
<p>Some 1.3million immigrants have come to the UK seeking work in the past ten years &mdash; but 3.5million Britons are claiming Jobseekers Allowance or Incapacity Benefit.</p>
<p>According to the MigrationWatch think tank, a culture of benefits dependency is fostering an &#8220;underclass of discouraged British workers&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition, it claims the arrival of huge numbers of immigrants tends to drive down wages &mdash; adding to the disincentive for those on benefits here to find work.</p>
<p>Ministers have repeatedly claimed that record levels of immigration are needed to fill up to 600,000 &#8220;vacancies&#8221; in the UK economy.</p>
<p>That is disputed by critics who say mass immigration pushes native workers out of the labour market.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown promised &#8220;British jobs for British workers&#8221; last year but opponents claim it is an empty pledge as long as immigration continues at its current rate.</p>
<p>The MigrationWatch research concludes that a combination of generous benefits and means-testing means there is &#8220;little financial incentive for people with families living on benefits to find employment&#8221;.</p>
<p>Examples cited in the study include a family with one parent earning the minimum wage who will be between £14 and &£24 per week worse off than if they received maximum Incapacity Benefit.</p>
<p>The parent would have to find a job paying £12.25 per hour before they would be better off &mdash; more than double the minimum wage of £5.52.</p>
<p>The study claims that getting Britons back into work as an alternative to mass immigration would slash the social security budget, ease pressure on infrastructure and services, curb the downward pressure on wages and reduce the &#8220;nonworking underclass&#8221;.</p>
<p>MigrationWatch chairman Sir Andrew Green said: &#8220;We keep hearing that we need immigrants to do the jobs that the British won&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been suspected for some time that benefit levels are a real disincentive to take work that is on offer and our research spells out why this may be so.&#8221;</p>

			<p>How much clearer could it be that environmentalism is merely a leftist tool in the service of other goals?  The greenbelt laws for years have preserved the open spaces of England from American-style suburbanization - driving up housing prices for the white British in the process - and are now to be paved over to provide homes for new immigrants.  Of course, the &#8220;true&#8221; environmentalist types will never have the courage to stand up to the nation-wreckers on this issue, just as the Sierra Club members here never voice opposition to mass immigration.</p>

			<p>&hellip;yet despite all the warning signs the British Government is, like the lifeboats in the various ship-disaster films, screaming:<br>
&#8220;We can take more! There&rsquo;s still room! SEND US MORE PEOPLE!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, like the lifeboats of yore, one of two things is going to happen:<br>
1. It&rsquo;s going to &#8220;capsise&#8221;, sending everyone fleeing to &#8220;other&#8221; lifeboats or<br>
2. The &#8220;new arrivals&#8221; will start pushing those already on the lifeboat into the water, leaving them to their fates.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got a strange feeling that No.2 is happening&hellip;</p>

			<p>If Native Born White Americans didn&rsquo;t have the option over trhe past 30 years of fleeing post-1965 non-white LEGAL immigrants, post-1965 Legal immigration policy would have been shut down a long time ago. There would have been 0 tolerance for the nonesense about the blessings of diversity.</p>
<p>As soon as lefty/liberal environmnetalist get their way, housing prices will skyrocket. White Americans will be trapped in the old suburbs and the option will be to:shut down all non-white LEGAL immigration and expulsion. This is my prediction. And it is also my prediction for England.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m praying for a very severe drought this summer in Georgia,South Carolina,North Carolina and Virginia. If there is another drought this summer, there will be house building moratorium and housing prices will sky rocket-subprime implosion notwithstanding. Housing prices continue to climb in Charlotte,Weddington and Waxhaw. You can not beleive how explosive the growth is down there. You have to see it to believe it. It&rsquo;s deep into Waxhaw now. All the ponds and streams are drying up right before your eyes.</p>
<p>Eventually, Native Born White Americans will be forced to do what they should have done thirty years ago:shut non-white immgration down to 0 and expulsion. It will happen. Liberal/left policies of population containment and smart growth gaurantee that it wil happen.</p>

			<p>This article was printed on the Daily Mail. Please commit that name to memory. The Daily Mail has a very easy comment section at the bottom of each article posted. Every time you see a LDM article, please visit it in its original, and leave a calling card. Every comment section in every on-line paper should be seen as an opportunity for us.<br>
It is time that we take seriously our duty to fight for our people and our lands. It is time that we begin thinking of ourselves as commissioned officers in an army which has not YET been formally created. Let us in these on-line articles act as comission officers and recruiters. It costs only a minute or two to create a mssg. and leave it.<br>
The entire educational establishment in the US has been highjacked to recruit for the enemy. Please do not underestimate how much your labor in this field is needed.<br>
The best calling cards are polite, concise, and thought provoking. For tactical reasons, it is best to do them in as neutral a voice as you can muster. The objective is to leave the name of American Renaissance or AmRen or Jared Taylor on the message, without it seeming that that was your primary purpose.<br>
(site admins can be very cagey creatures)<br>
As these people come by for a visit, surely some will turn away, some will sit silent, but each one of us knows that once upon a time we were innocently surfing the net and stumbled upon a link that took us to this website. We read and went away. Then we came back at another time to look again. Then after a bit, it became like a home base. We are not at all unique in this.<br>
This is how an army is built.<br>
I began this little missive by asking you to file away The Daily Mail (name) in your memory banks. I would ask you to file away also the names of ALL online periodicals which permit of commentary (preferably without time consuming registration feature) Share information. Start a chorus, or a drumbeat with your message.<br>
Since time is money, and eloquence takes time, the skillful soldier will make use of the notepad feature of his e-mail or clipboard feature elsewhere in your browser or homepage.<br>
In spare time, you can whittle up a good stockpile of generally worded messages which speak to a few general topic headings (such as population, job depletion, etc) with these, you can simply cut and paste and whiz off to another site like a ghost in the night. This multiplies your ammunition, so to speak. It only takes about 15 seconds to cut and paste, V maybe 3 to 5 to rough cut an original mssg each time.<br>
These are just a few suggestions I hope will be heard and put into practice. <br>
Please concider yourself a recruiter.<br>
Are your shoes polished?<br>

			<p>Here we have the first model of an economic model to study.  Increasing numbers of population through  high immigration artificially pumps an economy.  But growth based on this cannot be sustained, at some point it must level off.  People when crowded will naturally become more agitated and therefore crime goes up.  Culture and traditions suffer, as we know all too well.</p>
<p>All this damage so that a few industrialists could become richer and the government could collect higher tax revenues.</p>
<p>As for all those &#8220;higher&#8221; ideals of forever sallying forth to save less fortunate nations, I have this to offer;  As a doctor for nearly three decades I have learned one single truth - this truth is that it is possible to keep ones home and go to the hospital or office everyday and help all sorts of people.  The rule is to not bring them into your home.  Once the problem is in your home, you can no longer sally forth to aid the masses.  If your home is a disaster, you cannot do anything but cope with that problem, and few emerge unscathed from such a mistake.  </p>
<p>I think readers will grasp the analogy.</p>

			<p><b>Un</b>fortunately, increased population density seems to provide the Establishment with still more argument in favor of &#8220;salami-tactic&#8221; (i.e.: One thin slice at a time) indecent designs on the freedom of us Commons. And what do I mean by <i>freedom</i>? I mean that clear space between the outermost boundary of the compulsory (from whatever source the compelling character may be derived)and the outermost boundary of the forbidden (from whatever source the forbidding character may be derived), within which clear space one may act or not at will - or whim - insofar as one has power to act or decline to act. </p>
<p>Exercise of freedom requires elbow room, whether literal (<b>ob</b>jective: Alone in a wide territory at heuristic extreme) or psychic (norms of politeness and assigned space within the structure of norms, the norms including &#8220;traffic rules&#8221; of interpersonal interaction to minimize collisions).<br>
Creation of &#8220;<i>psychic</i> elbow room&#8221; is an Apollinian accomplishment, taking generations to assume its slow-changing forms. Dionysiac subcultures, whether they want to be so or not, are objectively adversarial to Apollinian order; they cannot help being so. They are useful to an elite by taking the liberties of the commons to absurd and/or dangerous lengths, and tempt defections by children impatient with socialization to Apollinian norms - even from the elite itself. As this process carries forward through the years, disciplines contributory to group survival of the Apollinian culture become diluted until penultimately they become mocked symbols and finally abandoned (Is not holding in sovereign indifference, that which your ancestors revered as sacred, psychic abandonment?).<br>
When the population of the formerly Apollinian culture becomes anomic enough to be an amorphous mass of atomized individuals rather than a People (upper-case here signifying the equivalent of <i>ethnos</i>, classical Greek; <i>leum</i>, Hebrew; <i>Volk</i>, German; <i>narod</i>, Russian), the elite can work its will. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Say goodbye to the English countryside&#8221;&hellip;someone says. I hate to break your bubble, but that countryside is owned and controlled by two groups.<br>
1.The native white Brits who want to destroy England by immigration.<br>
2. The immigrant investors from India, the Middle East and the good old USA.<br>
Even back in the seventies large parcels of land were owned by Arabs. My Scotland was Muslim land even then&hellip;I mean they owned the land the Scots walked upon.</p>
<p>The disaster unfolding in Britain was brought about by wealthy left wing native Brit&rsquo;s who started their game many decades ago. It&rsquo;s already too late, Britain is not Britain anymore. It is a third world nation where the only indigenous people left are those who can&rsquo;t run.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This is around 620 per square mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>This figure is simply incorrect.  If there really are 390 people per square kilometer (240 acres), then that comes to 1040 per square mile, or 1.6 people per acre.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say if the reporter was trying to squelch alarm on the part of the average Brit, or if reporters are as poor at math as they are at getting the facts.</p>

As if it really matters at this point. America is only 66% white now, and minorities are out-breeding them. For mainstream white Americans to survive this they must dismantle Liberalism, for it is Liberalism that put them in this predicament in the first place.</p>

			<p>Robert Kelly is right. Overpopulation IS the greatest danger facing the West. For years and years this was considered a serious issue on the left and preached all through the Seventies of the last Century. Now the lefts insanity is being exposed every day as they are responsible for not only not caring about the issue but even encouraging massive immigration, whether legal or illegal. It is one of the reasons I get so miffed with the ENVIRONMENTAL IMPOSTER ORGANIZATION known as the SIERRA CLUB. After years of supporting environmental causes like the cleaning up of pollutiong, trash,etc. this bogus organization comes out against any effort to stop massive illegal or even legal immigration. Scr-w them. Don&rsquo;t buy any of their poster, stupid trinkets, or anything else this phony organization offers.</p>

Don&rsquo;t support them and when the funds dry up, let those with an agenda use THEIR money to keep the Environmental Imposter Organziation, A.K.A. the Sierra Club solvent.  </p>

<p>If you couldn&rsquo;t care less, then you&rsquo;re missing the entire point. You&rsquo;re looking for the trees but the forest is in the way.</p>

			<p>I disagree, focusing on the trees(drying up the money)will dry up the forest.(Sierra Club) Money rules the world friend, don&rsquo;t ever forget it. </p>

			<p>Environmental laws are good becuase they make it harder for whites to run away from the problem.  The whitest big city in America is Portland, Oregeon, which is also the only city with European style developement restrictions.  It&rsquo;s not a coincidence.  Pro-white Americans have got to stop believing all the right-wing, conservative, capitalist lies that haven&rsquo;t helped us one bit.  </p>

<p>why is it in white countries we&rsquo;re hearing this?  it&rsquo;s like &#8220;immmigrants do the job that (fill in white native country) won&rsquo;t do&#8221;.  Wake up, White People!</p>

You ARE missing the point.  They don&rsquo;t need your money. A very rich donor has already out-bid you. They are being ruled by HIS money. You can&rsquo;t compete. Withholding your pennies (and mine) is not going to dry them up. </p>

			<p>Dunnyveg: &#8220;This figure is simply incorrect. If there really are 390 people per square kilometer (240 acres), then that comes to 1040 per square mile, or 1.6 people per acre.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good observation. Given that 1 mile = 1.61 km (to 3 s.f.), 390 per sq km becomes 390*1.61^2 = 1011 (approx.), but the journalist, presumably with a dim memory of basic math, has incorrectly calculated 390*1.61 = 628! It&rsquo;s surprising quite how many journalists, politicians and civil servants are essentially innumerate.</p>
<p>The figure of just under 400 per sq km comes ultimately from the Office of National Statistics:</p>

<p>Britain&rsquo;s census figures are highly unlikely to be accurate, so the true density might be as much as 10-15% higher. </p>

			<p>Again, I respect your replying but must disagree. Rich people detest the use of their own money for any length of time involving almost anything. They are the ones who invented the concept of O.P.M. (Other peoples money) The wealthy have never put idealism or loyalty over money. That&rsquo;s how they make so much.</p>

			<p>&#8220;As if it really matters at this point. America is only 66% white now, and minorities are out-breeding them. For mainstream white Americans to survive this they must dismantle Liberalism, for it is Liberalism that put them in this predicament in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we got the illegals out and the legal non-citizens from the 3rd world, America would be 80% white but we would have to get rid of leftist multicult crowd or fall on really hard times for that to happen and it could.</p>

			<p>How crowded is England? It is TWICE as crowded as Germany, FOUR times as crowded as France and more then TWELVE times as crowded as the United States. In proportional terms, Germany would have to have a population of 164 million to equal England. For France the figure is 246 million people to equal England&rsquo;s crowdedness. And for the USA it would be a mind-boggling 3,636,000,000 people! That&rsquo;s nearly TRIPLE the population of China.</p>
