						<p>&#8220;I guess this is how the West was won,&#8221; Hillary Clinton exulted at her victory rally in Las Vegas after the Democratic caucuses.</p>
<p>Well, not exactly, ma&rsquo;am. Yet how the Clintons, by deftly playing the race and gender cards, turned back the greatest single challenge to a Clinton Restoration will be studied for a long time to come.</p>
<p>It began in Iowa, where Barack Obama, the first African-American crossover candidate with broad appeal to all racial and ethnic groups, was on fire in a state that was overwhelmingly white.</p>
<p>Came then Billy Shaheen, the Clinton New Hampshire co-chair, to suggest that, were Barack to be nominated, Republicans would ask when he had stopped using drugs and whether he ever bought or sold drugs. Mark Penn of the Clinton campaign denied on MSNBC&rsquo;s &#8220;Hardball&#8221; that his team was raising the &#8220;cocaine issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mission accomplished, Shaheen dutifully resigned. Bill Clinton drove the point home, telling an interviewer that to nominate Obama would be a &#8220;roll of the dice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Barack won Iowa going away and stormed into New Hampshire for what pundits predicted would be a defeat for Hillary so crushing it would be the final chapter of the Clinton era.</p>
<p>Then Bill Clinton told a Dartmouth audience that Obama&rsquo;s claim to being consistently antiwar was a &#8220;fairy tale.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, plus the media pile-on, Barack&rsquo;s snide dismissal of her in the debate &mdash; &#8221;You&rsquo;re popular enough, Hillary&#8221; &mdash; and her choked-up moment hours before voting began caused the women of New Hampshire to rally in sympathy. Obama&rsquo;s lead, estimated by some at 15 points, vanished, and Hillary won what became one of the great upsets in New Hampshire history.</p>
<p>Stunned and stung, Barack&rsquo;s African-American backers then rushed into the baited trap. One after another, they headed for the TV cameras to charge that the Clintons had fought dirty, forcing voters to focus on the race and gender of the candidates rather than on their records, ideas and issues.</p>
<p>When Hillary said sweetly that while Dr. Martin Luther King was the inspirational leader of the civil rights revolution, LBJ was the indispensable leader who had enacted the laws, King, martyr-hero of black America, became an issue.</p>
<p>As the raillery grew acrimonious and the rage among Barack&rsquo;s backers rose, his black support solidified, but his white support, recoiling from race politics, peeled away. And the sisterhood rallied to Hillary.</p>
<p>Robert Johnson of Black Entertainment Television then stoked the fire once more, asserting that when Bill and Hillary were fighting for civil rights, Barack was in Chicago doing whatever he was doing in the neighborhoods. The implication: Barack was doing drugs, while Bill and Hillary marched. Denying malevolent intent, Johnson, too, apologized.</p>
<p>But the damage has been done. And reviewing the returns from Nevada and the polls in South Carolina, it may be irreversible. Barack is no longer a crossover candidate who transcends race. The color-blind coalition he seemed to be assembling appears to be coming apart.</p>
<p>His momentum is gone. The emotional movement that was Iowa has passed. The media are no longer smitten. And as African-Americans rally to him, Democratic women, a majority of the party, are rallying around Hillary.</p>
<p>Consider the stark Nevada returns. Though Barack used as the refrain of his concession speech in New Hampshire &#8220;Yes, we can!&#8221; &mdash; the battle cry of Hispanics, &#8220;Si, se puede&#8221; &mdash; though he was endorsed by the Culinary Workers Union, he lost Hispanics by nearly two to one.</p>
<p>Equally ominous, he lost both the white vote and the women&rsquo;s vote by the same three-to-two margin, while sweeping the African-American vote five to one. Once a candidate who happened to be black, Obama is now the black candidate.</p>
<p>This may be a portent of what is to come. With Hispanics, whites and women a huge majority of Democrats, Hillary should sweep a majority of states in the Southwest and the West, including Texas and California, where African-Americans are relatively few in number and Hispanics are many.</p>
<p>If Barack loses South Carolina, he is cooked, as the Clintonites have made him the favorite. Even if he carries South Carolina, it will be written off as black folks coming out for a native son.</p>
<p>Folks will look instead at how well, or badly, he does among whites. If Hillary and Edwards crush him among white voters, the message will be that the Democratic Party will risk ruin if it nominates an African-American who has shown little appeal among whites and even less among Hispanics. For whites and Hispanics are the swing votes in presidential politics.</p>
<p>In three weeks, Barack has been ghettoized. The crossover candidate, the great liberal hope, has become a Jesse Jackson, who is ceded the black vote and a few states, then given a speaking role at the convention, as the party moves on to the serious business of electing a president.</p>
<p>One cannot deny that Bill Clinton was right. Nominating Barack would be a &#8220;roll of the dice.&#8221; But nor can one deny that Bill and Hillary helped make sure the risk would be one the party would not take.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;As his support among blacks increases, his support among whites declines</p>
<p>Which certainly is good news for our side. But that Liberal Hillary must also be defeated. What better, or more appropriate weapon than using the Internet to make people aware of what another Clinton Administration would mean for our country. (As if their previous 8 years weren&rsquo;t bad enough.)</p>

			<p>One Clinton whore says something mean, then apologizes. Then another one says something mean, then he apologizes. As long as they &#8220;apologize&#8221; the Clintons can get away with anything.</p>
<p>Does this remind me of anything? The first thing that cam to mind was that terrific scene from &#8220;The Great Santini&#8221; where oldest son Ben is describing how his father treats him:</p>
<p><i>&#8216;I love you, Ben&rsquo; - PUNCH! - &#8216;I want you to be the best, Ben&rsquo; - KICK! - &#8216;And Ben, I think you&rsquo;re great, Ben&rsquo; - BOUNCE A BASKETBALL OFF OF MY HEAD!</i></p>

			<p>The Clintons are the epitome of the American Left which has wreaked havoc on this country.  They are for me the ultimate embodiment of the enemy.  They, and their kind, are to be detested and resisted above any minority group, any non-white racially conscious individual.  I will take an honest enemy any day over a hypocritical traitor.  </p>
<p>Amid all their sanctimonious drivel about diversity and equality, they clandestinely &#8220;play the race card&#8221; and do whatever else it takes to secure power for themselves.  Disgusting, absolutely disgusting.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m preaching to the choir here.    </p>

			<p>Sad to say, I think is wishful thinking on the part of Pat Buchanan and other fellow conservatives who are well aware of the threat that Barack poses to us.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton will be much easier to defeat. Polls showing Barack Obama beating John McCain and other republicans by as much as 15 points. The democrats are not as stupid as we may think. It is not by accident that Obama is getting heavy hitting endorsements from powerful democrats. </p>
<p>Jon Edwards could also play the role of spolier at the convention if he gets anought delegates. Guess where they will go&hellip; you guessed it, Barack Obama. </p>
<p>My point is that Obama could still win this contest and we conservaitves will be in for the fight of our lives!</p>

			<p>If that black gets elected president, it will be THE END for us all.  America will become like Zimbabwe, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Haiti, or any other black run wasteland in the world.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t have the intelligence or skills to organize, lead, or run any large or complex institution.  If he gets elected, you&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m right but, unfortunately, it will be too late for us all.</p>

			<p>As much as I can&rsquo;t stand either of the Clintons, it&rsquo;s been fun to watch them stripping the bark off Obama in the last week.  The guy is one of the fakiest and most fraudulent presidential aspirants since Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve repeatedly spoken of Obama&rsquo;s racist and ultra-lib record in Illinois to anyone who will listen.  In some cases, I&rsquo;ve been met with a &#8220;Oh, he seems like a nice guy&#8221; retort.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s NOT a nice guy.  Almost anyone can smile, read a speech, posture, and sound profound.  (I almost get the feeling from many Caucasians that it&rsquo;s somewhat amazing that someone who&rsquo;s only half-White can pull off the act.)  What&rsquo;s important is that he&rsquo;s the latest black nationalist African to try to hoodwink dumb Whites.  And from the messianic reception he experienced in Iowa, he&rsquo;s obviously succeeded to a large degree.</p>
<p>Let Uncle Bill and Hillary, then, go after him.  As Churchill said, &#8220;I&rsquo;d make a pact with the devil if that&rsquo;d win the war&#8221;.  Let them do the dirty work no conservative man or woman could get away with.</p>

			<p>There may be more White women in the Democratic Party but a Democrat can&rsquo;t win the Presidency without the black vote, at least not yet.  Hillary is going to anger alot more blacks when she gets the nomination.  They&rsquo;re going to remember all those nasty almost racist things she&rsquo;s been saying on the TV.  I wonder how this will play out on Election Day?   This will probably be the only chance in US history for a black candidate to get nominated other than the usual Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton types.   The demographics are against it.   Once the Clintons get back in office they&rsquo;re going to press for the &ldquo;Comprehensive Immigration Reform&rdquo; package to be pushed through Congress.   Every effort will be made to make every single one of those former illegal aliens a registered Democrat.  You blacks can hiss and boo and threaten to leave the Party but you have nowhere to go.   Of course they&rsquo;ll want you to stay but your no longer going to influence Party Politics like you have before.  </p>

			<p>Great! - There&rsquo;s still a lot of work to be done on Hilary, and the rest of the Republican/Democrat (or &#8220;Demographic&#8221;) party members in favour of illegal immigrants, but at least it seems as if &#8220;Obomination&#8221; is faltering.</p>

			<p>I live in Las Vegas. I could have bet money (literally!) that Obama would crash and burn here. We are still very much a blue-collar and conservative state with some liberal leanings. There are many Hispanic and Mormon families all over Nevada who don&rsquo;t look to kindly toward Barack.</p>
<p>I live next door to a Hispanic family. The wife of the household and I were talking and she said to me (I&rsquo;m quoting word-for-word, brace yourself!) &#8220;a president named Barack? are you kidding me? This isn&rsquo;t Africa! this is America!&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to see this country look like Africa!&#8221;</p>
<p>As you might guess, my Hispanic neighbor voted for Hillary Clinton.</p>

			<p>I really don&rsquo;t believe Obama has anything of substance to say. Would he really be in charge if elected President. No. He has taken huge contributions from the insurance industry and other giant firms. He would simply do the neocons bidding. I&rsquo;ve listened to his debating, he is a smooth speaker, but whether Obama was black or white, there is nothing there of substance. </p>

<p>Barack is not entirely an African name..Moslems and Jews also use this name. Barack means &#8220;blessed&#8221; in Swahili..Barack doesn&rsquo;t mean blessed in Arabic, it means &#8220;thunder&#8221;. And Barak is a Hebrew name meaning flash of light.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t make Barack out to be any more or less then what he is: A politician born into a upper middle class, free thinking, liberal white family with roots in both Europe and Africa. If you read his books, he makes it very obvious that he is a politician first and for most. He has been doing things and saying things for years to get people to do what he wants them to do. He has no great insight, and he has no more of a dastardly plan then any other politician.</p>

			<p>Saw a poll today that said more Whites than Blacks will vote for Obama! Something like 73% of Whites said they would vote for a Black President! This country is on it&rsquo;s way out when such a large percentage think that is okay&hellip;.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;If Hillary and Edwards crush him among white voters, the message will be that the Democratic Party will risk ruin if it nominates an African-American who has shown little appeal among whites and even less among Hispanics. For whites and Hispanics are the swing votes in presidential politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very interesting and insightful take on the election, and also the likely future of the Democratic party and this country. This is particularly true for blacks, who have long hoped that they will get a &ldquo;well earned&rdquo; revenge on whites, once or if, we become &ldquo;just another minority&rdquo; in this country.</p>
<p>As von Clausewitz observed: &ldquo;War is not an independent phenomenon, but the continuation of politics by different means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blacks have long used politics in this country (along with criminal violence,) as a form of racial warfare. Through cynical manipulations by their &ldquo;leaders,&rdquo; they have endlessly sought to gain undeserved economic and social advantages under the guises of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;equality,&rdquo; and by playing on the &ldquo;white guilt&rdquo; of our sanctimoniously treasonous &ldquo;elites.&rdquo; That game, might just be up; ironically, it might just be that American &ldquo;multiculturalism&rdquo; has proven to be a failure most abysmally for blacks in this country, just when that dogma was supposed to propel one of &ldquo;them&rdquo; into the White House?</p>
<p>Perhaps, 2008 will be black &ldquo;America&rsquo;s&rdquo; Stalingrad?</p>
<p>As the country moves ever closer to that dreadful day blacks pray for (majority nonwhite status,) it gains more and more &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; rivals for them in the form of Hispanics. Already, there are more Hispanics than blacks in this land (about 14% versus 13% of the population) and every year that demographic increases. Irregardless of who wins the Presidency this year, that number is probably going to increase; again ironically, if it is a Democrat, the increase will likely be greater then if a Republican should win. But what will blacks do, in their self-absorbed ignorance should Hillary or Edwards get the nomination over Obama? They will almost assuredly vote for the Democrat, or simply stay home in wounded disgust? They will never turn out in great numbers for a Republican no matter his or her race, and this year the only option would be a white man so there is the double whammy, in their vapidly greedy eyes.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t have the long term strategic sense to participate in a collective &ldquo;revenge&rdquo; vote. Thus, it will be a rather sullen business as usual exercise for them.</p>
<p>As Otto Von Bismark observed: &ldquo;Never believe anything in politics until it has been officially denied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly their &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; and all the foolish talking heads, will deny the crashing of the significance  of a Obama Hindenburg; certainly the Titanic of multiculturalism will still be lauded as &ldquo;the way to go.&rdquo; But it will be all for naught, since tribalism and self-interested &ldquo;swing voting&rdquo; are not just things of the past, they are the waves of an uncertain future in which a country that is possibly going to be 50% white and 30% Hispanic, will be dealing with a overly troublesome and arrogant black minority of 13% to 14%. </p>
<p>Goodbye Miss American Pie and welcome to the day &ldquo;The Dream&rdquo; died?</p>

			<p>Hispanics hate blacks more than whites ever did. Just talk to them. Being in the restaurant business, too, I talk to many of the illegals that work in the back for me and not a single one would vote (as soon as they get a driverse license) for a black. </p>
<p>They hated them in Mexico and they hate them here. It is so bad in the restaurant business down here in Florida, that when you decide to hire illegals (to save a ton of money by not paying all these SS taxes and high income taxes) you had best get rid of your legal American Blacks since you will have knife fights if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>For the restaurant business, illegal Mexicans are far better than domesticated Blacks. That is why the restaurant, and construction business supports open borders ( and Hilary and John McCain, etc.). </p>
<p>Once the present illegals are legal, where are we to get the next crop of illegals from? The fact they are ILLEGAL is why they are wanted by the service industry. If you ever had the chance to see how much we have to pay in income tax, unemployment tax, worker&rsquo;s comp tax, social security tax, medicare tax, etc. you too would hire anyone who is illegal.</p>
<p>You will end illegal workers when the gov&rsquo;ment stop taxing to death small business.</p>

			<p>I hope Patrick Buchanan who I respect is not getting old and blind.  I am disappointed with the Obamamania for two reasons.  One is his affiliation to the church he attends.  And I feel the battle over that issue hasn&rsquo;t even begun.  Obama&rsquo;s major set back and controversy is not his skin color but his ties to racism and hatred.  No white, asian, or hispanic could in good consciousness go vote for a man whose goes to a church that is so racist, anti-American, anti-white and way way out of the mainstream.  Now some of those folks may vote for him - but they are either deranged, hate America, or have suicidal thoughts for America - apparently many do.  Look it up yourself.  Look up the Trinity Church of Christ where Obama attends.  Seeing is believing and it is very troubling to me what I see there.  Obama does not even deserve to be running.  And it is mind boggling that he has gained as much support as he has.  </p>
<p>Now the other reason I&rsquo;m disappointed is that Obama is a Caucasian American to me.  He is mulatto.  I don&rsquo;t look at him as black or African American.  Maybe I&rsquo;m just too progressive minded but Obama is a mulatto candidate.  To call him an African American has a genocidal / suppressive ring to it to me.  He&rsquo;s part white.  And he belongs to a pro-African and racist church that thinks highly of Louis Farrakhan by giving him an award last month.  How screwed up is that? </p>

			<p>The poster LOGIC is correct in his point about Hispanics hating blacks  &mdash;  with a passion!  Also, Asians don&rsquo;t like blacks, Russians, etc.  &mdash;  -the list goes on.</p>
<p>I remember the horrible incident where Bill Cosby&rsquo;s son was murdered, by a Russian? (I think?).  Mrs. Cosby blamed it on America who supposedly made him racist!  How sadly naive.</p>
<p>These people come here with their prejudices firmly set in place. They don&rsquo;t buy into the PC propaganda.</p>

			<p>Blacks are death to any party, institution, or company where they rule the roost.When they are top dog, there is white flight. Where ever blacks are in great numbers whites leave, that is why most white men have left the Democratic party. I think we are moving to a time where no party will court the black vote because where you find blacks you find mayhem, chaos, surliness and whites don&rsquo;t like friction&hellip;we like peace and quiet and courteousness</p>

			<p>&#8220;Maybe I&rsquo;m just too progressive minded but Obama is a mulatto candidate. To call him an African American has a genocidal / suppressive ring to it to me. He&rsquo;s part white.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as &#8220;part white&#8221; in my view.  You are either white (ie fully so) or you are not.  I think the &#8220;one drop rule&#8221; is a good thing for preserving the integrity of our race.  I have been to Brazil and there are many so called whites there who we would never consider to be white in the US.</p>

			<p>Compare  B. Hussein Obama&rsquo;s involvement with a church of black racism &amp; veneration of Louis Farrakhan with George Allen&rsquo;s career ending utterance of the word macaca, or Trent Lott&rsquo;s career ending comment in praise of a retiring colleague - he actually dared to suggest that the man may have made a good president. </p>
<p>Then again, this rabid reaction against anything suggesting that the democrat stronghold on national government that lasted 50 years has been anything less than divine intervention shouldn&rsquo;t surprise me. </p>
<p>Consider they way they value Ted Kennedy.  So what if he left a girl stuck in a car underwater for 12 hours while going to sober up &amp; concoct a story? Just a warm-up for holding open the gates to a flood of third-world immigrants to drown the rest of the country as well. Those born here? Naturally, he&rsquo;s a staunch supporter of killing them by the millions before they get out of the womb. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that they field a candidate for the highest office in the land who can point to no other qualifying accomplishment than being able to credibly be referred to as &#8220;African&#8221;, in whatever degree. </p>
<p>The incredible lack of; or more like what appears to be the willful rejection and determined suppression of rationality in our public discourse has me worried about this country. </p>

			<p>The fact that Obama gets almost no criticism in the mainstream media for attending a church that honored the racist, antisemitic, and homophobic Farakkan is disgusting.  You can bet that if any white candidate attended a church that honored David Duke (or even the more moderate Jared Taylor) there would be uproar in the media and violent demonstrations against him.</p>

			<p>I think whites initially supported Obama because his feel good kumbayah message of hope sounded nice in the beginning. But after you&rsquo;ve heard it the third or fourth time you start waiting for him to give you some substance. He wants to change America, okay great. But change it in what way? How is he going to make these changes a reality? Then there&rsquo;s the fact that this country is a total mess right now, with the war and an impending recession. Does Obama really have what it takes to be in charge of all this? Hillary is doing a pretty good job of convincing voters that Obama is not up to the job.</p>
<p>The accusations of racism are also playing a part. Bill Clinton&rsquo;s &#8220;fairy tale&#8221; remark is racist??? And so is Shaheen mentioning Obama&rsquo;s history of illegal drug use??? If someone had said something truly racist about Obama, most whites would be sympathetic. But when the Obama camp starts tearing apart statements from the Clintons or anybody else in search of any and every little word or phrase that could be construed as racist, even a lot of white liberals get turned off. This might help Obama win black votes, but not white votes. And if he can&rsquo;t take the &#8220;racism&#8221; that the Clinton campaign is dishing out, what&rsquo;s he going to do if he wins the nomination and he has to face the Republicans who REALLY know how to play dirty politics? </p>

			<p>Everything Black in this country is sanitized, the bad ignored or excused, the good magnified (or invented), whether it be Black crime rates, bastardy, M. L. King, the Jena Six, or B. H. Obama.  When the MSM gets around to openly dissecting MLK&rsquo;s plagiarism and promiscuity, or the fraudulence of the Jena Six story, I might be willing to listen to them on Mr Obama.  Until then, you&rsquo;d have have to be a full time fool to actually think this guy fit to be a mayor, let alone a dogcatcher.  </p>

			<p><i>Hillary is going to anger alot more blacks when she gets the nomination. They&rsquo;re going to remember all those nasty almost racist things she&rsquo;s been saying on the TV. I wonder how this will play out on Election Day?</i></p>
<p>I agree with your analysis.</p>
<p>The last black guy who had a half-decent chance at the Democratic nomination was Jesse Jackson, in 1984 and 1988. In both cases the general election went badly for the Democrats. You have to wonder if blacks were depressed my the Democrats rejection of one of their own.</p>
<p>Barack Obama is an even more promising candidate than Jackson, in so many ways. He certainly hasn&rsquo;t demonized whites in the way that Jackson did. So if the Democratic Party rejects him, too? I expect to see much lower turnout from blacks this fall if Obama&rsquo;s not on the ticket - and it&rsquo;s increasingly likely that he won&rsquo;t be. Add that to Clinton fatigue and it&rsquo;s looking worse for the Clintons.</p>

<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t have the intelligence or skills to organize, lead, or run any large or complex institution. If he gets elected, you&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m right but, unfortunately, it will be too late for us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>I totally agree.  All the white people I tell this to don&rsquo;t listen or just think I&rsquo;m a kook racist.  They think that Obama is intelligent, young, articulate, etc., but don&rsquo;t seem to get it.  Even if he is all these nice things, symbolically he will be a catalyst for more blacks to get into power positions and we will have something similar to South Africa or Rhodesia before their demise.  It wouldn&rsquo;t take much for that to happen.  People don&rsquo;t seem to understand what a black run government would look like.  They really need to travel to Africa before making a stupid statement saying that Obama is going to be a new force for change or other such nonsense.  The guilt complex here reinforced with ignorance is too strong for whites to come to their senses.  We all know that the other races don&rsquo;t want a black leader.  They&rsquo;re not as stupid some of these guilt-ridden whites think.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I talk to many of the illegals that work in the back for me&#8221;</p>
<p>You, &#8216;Logic&rsquo;, are a traitor to this country. Hispanics made a hash out of my industry (contruction) and drove me to do something else because I couldn&rsquo;t compete price-wise. White carpenters who did excellent work were replaced by hispanics who as a group don&rsquo;t care about job safety or quality. In the &rsquo;80s there was a construction boom in NYC. You could tell by all the ads for the trades in the NY Post, Daily News etc.<br>
In the &rsquo;90s there was a boom. Maybe one ad, if that, would make its way into the English language papers. All the rest were in &#8216;El Diario&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;you too would hire anyone who is illegal.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hired real Americans, and yes, I had to put up with the multiple taxes and agencies (NY State is horrible to have a small business in). So you hate the bureucracy but then you take it out on other Americans. Disgraceful.</p>
<p>I repeat: You are a traitor to this country and have my full contempt. If I had my way you would be in jail.</p>

			<p>Asians and Hispanics may fear blacks almost as much as whites do. They may fear blacks, but Asians and Hispanics are also more than willing to sit on the side-lines leaving whites take all the credit for it.</p>
<p>When blacks are afraid of whites, whether this fear is based on reality or not, the victim is paraded before a stage and encouraged to speak out. Society is then deemed evil and in need of restructure. When whites are afraid of blacks: this also proves whites are evil, and that they need more &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; training to bring them around (shut them up).  </p>

<p>I must confess, you fell into a trap I set. One, I don&rsquo;t own a restaurant but many of my friends do. That is where I got my information. Two, alot of my friends are in the construction business, thus more information.</p>
<p>I wrote that to make a BIGGER point. The government is killing small business and the government is ALLOWING businesses to hire illegals, all at the same time, thus making the situation even worse.</p>
<p>I only hire white males in the businesses I do own, so please calm down. The point of my post was to make people get angry, sick and informed of the BIGGER picture of how our own government is killing America.</p>
<p>My personal philosophy is 1) No income tax. 2) No Social Security tax 3) No Medicare tax. All taxes should be sale/property taxes ONLY. Direct taxation that nobody can avoid or evade.</p>
<p>And, all illegals must be deported immediately or jailed in concentration camps until they leave. Get them off the streets, out of our cities and either back where they came or large camps out west where we don&rsquo;t have to see them. This can be done in one month.</p>
<p>The problem is that NONE of my solutions will be done. Thus, the problems will never be solved without violence. Violence it will be in our future.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In three weeks, Barack has been ghettoized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, he has done it to himself.  I have known a few mixed race people. Most acknowledge both sides of the family, especially if the Father seduced and bigamously married a teen age girl and disappeared leaving the Mother and her parents with full emotional, social and financial responsibility for the offspring of the sperm donor.</p>
<p>I read Obama&rsquo;s first book.  He made it very clear that he despises Whites and identifies as a militant black leader.</p>
<p>Of course he looks black rather than mixed. Actually, he looks more black than Jesse Jackson.  George Washington was a platonist, he believed there was a natural aristocracy of leaders who the common people would recognize and vote for. There would be no need for political parties.  Washington made one speech in which he said that if political parties have their way, a party could dress up a broom stick up in a suit and have it elected president.</p>
<p>That is what Obama is.  A living mannequin that Soros bought, dressed up and is now running for President.  I wonder what the Clinton&rsquo;s did to incur Soros&rsquo; ire?  Or maybe Soros is just showing who is the real power in America, like all those bloodthirsty medieval warlords who put puppet Kings on their thrones.</p>

			<p>I recall the situation in my part of Northern California in the 1980s.  Construction was hampered because the white workers were unreliable.  Almost all of the whites in this job description seemed to be on drugs, mostly meth.  They would work like crazy for a few days and then don&rsquo;t show up for a few days.  While I don&rsquo;t agree with illegals or hiring them,  I can see how it happened.  I also recall seeing a story on tv some years ago about how resorts were turning to immigrants in hotels and restaurants because the tradtional college student employees had become unreliable due to excessive partying and a general lack of serious committment to their jobs.  We as a culture must undo this problem if we really want to permantently solve the illegal immigration - or governmnet program to bring in &#8220;guest workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>We must go back to basics in many ways if we want to survive.</p>

<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think many whites understand or Obama wouldn&rsquo;t be where he is.   Most whites I talk to almost get hostile if I mention racial issues.  Most whites who live in mostly white areas or countries don&rsquo;t understand because they have never been exposed to multiracial societies or neighborhoods where blacks have lived. They never went to school with them or worked them, etc.  I&rsquo;ve met many people abroad who think that american blacks are victims in this country and this is the richest country in the world with the richest blacks in the world.  From my perspective, I think most whites don&rsquo;t understand.  Did de Klerk understand?  Did some of our forefathers understand or care about our future when they brought slaves to the Americas?</p>

			<p>Logic,</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, I feel better. Or maybe not. From personal experience I agree with your point about changing the environment for small business. It&rsquo;s practically axiomatic. I like your proposals and they actually do have a shot a being implemented, but not in this environment and only after the smoke clears and people start thinking cleanup. If we survive.</p>
<p>However, you do know how many small business owners sound like your parody and mean it. One of them even posted a video question at the CNN/YouTube debate, begging for &#8216;relief&rsquo;. Tancredo blasted the guy. There is also a guy called Williams the Plumber who posts here consistently with the same drumbeat, &#8220;I hire Mexicans, they&rsquo;re better than blacks&#8221; etc. Your post sounded just like him. He probably means it. I reacted strongly because I am sick of hearing it.</p>
<p>There was another point to my rant. You say that Gov&rsquo;t kills small businesses and allows them to hire illegals. Yet, taking into account that people have to feed their families, that does not excuse the small business owner from having to do the right thing. I got out and found a way to support my family. I did this because I saw what LEGAL immigration did to my neighborhood (hell, the whole city) and I will never be a part of inflicting that on other whites where they live.We blame the Gov&rsquo;t but then act just like them on a small scale. The enemy is us.</p>
<p>So Logic, I now like your real persona but still think your fake one should be in jail, along with his flesh and blood buddies. Now I feel better.</p>

			<p>As a person, Obama is nothing but a media creation. A politician as devoid of character and substance as he is of real ideas. How can any RATIONAL person see him as anything but a creature created by the media   &mdash;   like the average rockstar/entertainer.</p>
<p>His shabby record in the Illinois legislature speaks for itself. As does his race-oriented pandering. Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;biography&#8221; has been weel reviewed and dissected on this site last year. In his shameless pandering to Blacks, he manages to completely forget his White genetic input. We are expected to see him as a bridgebuilder overcoming the racial gap? Anyone seeing Obama in a positive light, has to be under the influence of pot smoke or cheap alcohol. Or, like our media, seeing him as something to make a fast buck on.</p>

Obama&rsquo;s not new to the process.  Exactly the same thing could be said of other political protégés.   I remember seeing a television interview   &mdash;   oh, many years ago   &mdash;   conducted with David Rockefeller.   He mentioned that he had received a recommendation for this little-known Southern governor who showed promise, and they arranged  an interview for him.  He made a good impression and they decided to put their chips on him. They gave him their backing and next thing,  this politician almost unheard of outside of Georgia, was a presidential candidate. His name was Jimmy Carter. </p>
<p>We all know how well he worked out   &mdash;   well, at least for the country.   Apparently, those who employed him were quite satisfied though.   DR expressed no regrets.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think Obama had that much support to begin with other than the media falling all over him.  Just because he won the Iowa primary doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s alot of support for him.  The number of people voting in primaries is only a fraction of the actual registered voters in the state.  When all is said and done on Election Day I would guarantee his support in Iowa would be less than 5%.</p>

Our enemies gloat every time a White girl commits self-genocide, which is probably why they have put this clown up for the nomination.  </p>

			<p><i>&#8220;A very interesting and insightful take on the election, and also the likely future of the Democratic party and this country.

A very naive (and foolish ) assumption on their part, I&rsquo;d say.  Once we become a minority, where will that leave THEM?   In charge of something?  No.  Still &#8220;just another minority&#8221; too.   And the next group that replaces us might not be so guilt-ridden, generous, and idealistic as the former foolish white majority were.  The blacks might well find that they&rsquo;ve fallen out of the frying pan and into the fire.</p>
