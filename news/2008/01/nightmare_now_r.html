<h1>&lsquo;Nightmare&rsquo; Now Reality at Mines</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fin24 (Sandton, South Africa), January 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The &#8220;nightmare&#8221; of all South Africa&rsquo;s major gold and platinum mines shutting down, because of power cuts, became true on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tens of millions of rands a day are being lost. It&rsquo;s a nightmare,&#8221; said T-sec chief economist Mike Schussler.</p>
<p>The JSE gold mining sub-sector closed almost 6% lower on Friday.</p>
<p>Chris Hart, Investment Solution economist, said mining was a key industry for the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;From that point of view the (power) cuts seem &hellip; almost a disaster. &#8220;</p>
<p>The Chamber of Mines earlier announced that several gold and platinum mines had to shut down operations because Eskom could not guarantee power supplies on Friday.</p>
<p>Coal supplies that got wet due to the weather formed part of the problem, said senior executive Frans Baker .</p>
<p>Apparently some power stations had also gone down.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Very dramatic&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Harmony Gold spokesperson Amelia Soares said the company had only run emergency facilities in Friday.</p>
<p>The company would lose R60m from Friday&rsquo;s suspended operations, she said.</p>
<p>Gold Fields spokesperson Willie Jacobsz said the company was losing production of around 7 000 ounces per day because of the shutdown.</p>
<p>The impact of power cuts was &#8220;very, very dramatic. It is radical &hellip; unprecedented,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>AngloGold Ashanti said it had halted mining and gold recovery operations throughout SA.</p>
<p>BHP Billiton SA said its Bayside, Hillside and Mozal aluminium smelters continued to operate although power cuts were occurring at these locations.</p>
<p>The manganese mine at Hotazel was not operational on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have voluntarily reduced load at Metalloys and MMC since Thursday.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Consumers can&rsquo;t solve the problem</b></p>
<p>The company said its coal mines were continuing to operate. &#8220;[We] are doing everything [we] can to ensure coal supply to Eskom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trade union Solidarity said platinum company Lonmin had been busy withdrawing its workers from the workplace on Friday.</p>
<p>None of the mining companies had a timeframe of how long the situation was expected to continue.</p>
<p>Gold Fields spokesperson Jacobsz said Eskom had indicated to them that all key industrial consumer (KIC) loads would be reduced to &#8220;survival levels&#8221; or switched out totally for the next two to four weeks.</p>
<p>Earlier, on Friday, the Democratic Alliance said the shutdown of the mines indicated the electricity crisis was out of control.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Government&rsquo;s] fundamental mismanagement of Eskom is now threatening to derail our future economic prospects,&#8221; said DA minerals and energy spokesperson Hendrik Schmidt.</p>
<p>Freedom Front Plus head Pieter Mulder said the government and Eskom could not expect consumers to solve the problem instead of the suppliers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government&rsquo;s measures will punish consumers with fines, quotas and rationing, while the crisis was largely caused by poor short term planning and maintenance at Eskom.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rand likely to weaken</b></p>
<p>Hart said while in some ways, the power crisis was a result of the success of South Africa&rsquo;s previous economic growth, &#8220;[Now] we can&rsquo;t progress from what we have achieved&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said the rand was likely to weaken even more than it already had.</p>
<p>T-sec chief economist Schussler said he had not been approached by so many people for economic advice since September 11.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brain is fried. Everyone is up in arms,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are very very negative. Negativity in its own right will have an impact on the economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you invest in a country whose electricity is not secure? As we lose interest so do foreigners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schussler said government needed to spend more time on the power issue that &#8220;fighting amongst themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s time the blame gets laid on the right people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite numerous efforts, comment from Eskom on the situation could not be obtained.</p>
