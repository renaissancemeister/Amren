						<p>The state&rsquo;s public defender council voted Friday to place longtime DeKalb County public defender Larry Schneider on administrative leave pending an investigation related to Schneider&rsquo;s use of a racial slur in a meeting.</p>
<p>The Georgia Public Defender Standards Council cited an unspecified allegation about Schneider&rsquo;s conduct at a Dec. 7 meeting with council staff. Schneider said in an interview he told a story at the meeting about overhearing a DeKalb judge use a slur shortly before Schneider was appointed public defender in 1984.</p>
<p>The slur was the &#8220;n-word,&#8221; and Schneider acknowledged he used it .</p>
<p>&#8220;I did say the word .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was a story quoting a Superior Court judge in 1984 and was to illustrate my familiarity with racial bias in the court system,&#8221; Schneider said.</p>
<p>Schneider, who is white, said he told the story while pressing council staff to give him &#8220;race and sex data on our clients so that I could analyze them for evidence of racial bias.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he has told the same story in public oral history sessions without incident.</p>
<p>Schneider said he was not informed of the complaint against him until DeKalb Superior Court Judge Mark Anthony Scott, a member of the public defender council, called him Thursday and told him he was offended by the comments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Scott offered the motion Friday which found probable cause to seek Schneider&rsquo;s removal. The council&rsquo;s staff recused itself from the investigation. A special master will be appointed to conduct a hearing and then make a recommendation to the council, which will make a final decision on whether to remove Schneider from office.</p>

			<p> I almost got kicked out of night school on a Tuesday once  by my arts teacher after spending a weekend at the ranch. I jumped up in the middle of  class and screamed in pain and  rage, &#8220;God! I hate chiggers!!!&#8221; The instructor went into a hysterical disbarment mode until I pulled out my shirt tail and showed the class about three hundred red welts all around my beltline. Even my buddy Henry told me that, &#8220;You were real  close cowboy&hellip;&#8221;  The teacher  started to warn me after class until I shot  her a bartenders look of  &#8220;I can find out where you live,Better not push it lady!&#8221; </p>

<p>I guess if this very thin skinned black judge is offended by the use of the &#8220;n&#8221; word in relating an incident, that&rsquo;s all it takes to get this public defender&rsquo;s job.   That&rsquo;s outrageous! Just what kind of judge do you think this guy is?  I sure wouldn&rsquo;t want to be a white defendant in this idiot&rsquo;s court. Why are black people always going out of their way to be offended?</p>

			<p>This doesn&rsquo;t hurt my feelings one bit. Anytime something bad happens to a lawyer makes it a good day. They&rsquo;re the ones who started all this mess with the blacks in the first place. I don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s the best guy in the world, he&rsquo;s a lawyer.</p>

			<p> So Judge Mark Anthony Scott (wonder what color HE is?) is offended by a White man&rsquo;s use of &#8220;the N-word&#8221; even in the context of quoting someone from 24 years ago? There will be a pause while we all say in unison, &#8220;Who cares?&#8221; Every time Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton open their mouths they offend me. Does anyone care about that? No, of course not.</p>
<p> This is one of the main things that is slowly but surely ruining this once-great country   &mdash;   this type of hyper-sensitivity to anything that might conceivably offend the super-privileged minority that one dare not offend, on pain of ostracism and administrative leave   &mdash;   if not worse. With apologies to Lord Alfred Douglas, one might call it &#8220;the slur that dare not speak its name.&#8221; </p>

			<p>I believe that &#8220;He said he has told the same story in public oral history sessions without incident.&#8221; But what this genius did not realize was that he was speaking during Get Whitey day, so whatever he said was going to be used to persecute him.</p>
<p>And some of you wonder why I reside in a 3rd world country. At least I am safe from this kind of nonsense.</p>

			<p>This story brought a smile to my face. This self hating White liberal was trying to prove racial bias in the court system and got burned by the VERY people he was trying to help- - unbelievable!!! I hope this &#8220;special master&#8221;[oooooh the terror] throws the book at him. It makes my day when White liberals get what they deserve.</p>

			<p>This has gotten completely out of hand. We&rsquo;ve totally lost our minds in this country. With all the problems that face this us, we spend our time and newsprint reporting the outrage expressed over what is nothing but a word, especially in this case when the word was used by a person other than the accused, who was merely quoting that person in order to illustrate something. <br>
We need to adress some of the social problems aflicting the US; many of which are created and perpetuated by the very group who is so outraged by the use of the &#8220;N&#8221; word and who themselves use it constantly.<br>
This absurdity along with New Jersey&rsquo;s apology for slavery is another nail in the coffin of the pathetic nation that we&rsquo;ve become. <br>
Let&rsquo;s end the double standard. Let&rsquo;s make the use of the &#8220;N word&#8221; punisable by 2-5 years incarceration for the first offense and lethal injection for the second.  This will be applicable to anyone of any race who uses it in any context so long as there is a credible witness to testify that that accused used it. </p>
<p>Only a fantasy but it would be interesting to see what effect it would have on demographics.</p>

			<p>Good.  The public defender was looking for data to help him get more Black thugs off,  and now he might lose his job.  I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s home right now, incredulous at the dimwittedness of his critics, and shrieking the N-word into his pillow.  </p>

			<p>Are the Black Activists aware of Abraham Lincoln using the &#8220;N&#8221; word. He once mentioned having one stuck on the end of a pitch-fork. Imagine, the great Abe use the word many times.</p>
<p>In fact, if the average Black knew what Lincoln said about blacks and slavery, etc, they would demand the demolition of the Lincoln Memorial. It will happen in time.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;&hellip; Judge Mark Anthony Scott, a member of the public defender council, called him Thursday and told him he was offended by the comments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would be even more offended if I had any authority there, because I would give the good black judge a high School GED test, and if he flunked it, as I suspect he would, I&rsquo;d initiate an investigation to find out how he got his law license.</p>
<p>Am I unreasonable?  </p>
<p>Of course not.  The reasoning behind such a decision is because <br>
the majority of blacks who pass law school do so ONLY because of affirmative action in order to get more black faces in the profession.</p>
<p>Remember what Bill Clinton said in one of his books?  He admitted to passing blacks who didn&rsquo;t meet minimum standards in his law class, because of some vague something or other which gave him the necessary insight to understand they were qualified for the legal profession anyway.  It&rsquo;s ESP, of course.   But, of course again, it doesn&rsquo;t apply to whites.</p>
<p>And is there still anybody out there, not a mentally disturbed liberal, who doesn&rsquo;t believe every state grades the Bar exams with a pro black fervor/favor, knowing that the American Bar Assn. and the state bars are radically pro-minority as are the bar members who administer the testing?</p>

			<p>The &#8220;N&#8221; word is a trap set by blacks to entrap Whites who speak it or anything that a black says sounds like it. <br>
Blacks use it freely, knowing that they are safe. They then listen for Whites using it, knowing that they can get the White fired, arrested, or both.<br>
The White is always guilty. There is no excuse and no defense. </p>

			<p>I got in trouble a few years ago for a lot worse, something about referring to a lady lawyer as a man hating female German Shepherd.<br>
     This character  has less than cod one, if he doesn`t fight this all the way. All the people he was forced to represent will demand new trials because their lawyer was a racist and intentionally lost their cases. He did nothing wrong except not tell one and all to kiss his rebel rear end.<br>
     He should be on national tv, raising hell about the ingratitude of the thousands of black folks he saved from  milleniums of incarceration. He sounds like a liberal gay man of the oughts to me and if he doesn`t like boys he sure ddoesn`t like girls. He is the perfect new age Atlanta Metro-Sexual. If he won`t fight this, he dosen`t merit the title lawyer.<br>

			<p>Holding all lawyers responsible for what was done in the 1960s makes about as much sense as blaming contemporary whites for slavery.  If it weren&rsquo;t for lawyers, especially public defenders, the bill of rights would be a dead letter and we could all be disposed of for reading this website.</p>

			<p>So as not to offend anyone, let us devise some words for criminal court: No longer Defendants, they are Suspected of Being Poor. We all know that most of the people we now call Defendants are just poor.  No longer Black criminals, now they are Representatives of the Black Community.  Well, that&rsquo;s a start.  I am sure others will come up with some interesting words to satisfy even Judge Scott.  </p>

			<p>Racial and ethnic &#8220;slurs&#8221; are nothing more than words that are synonymous for race and ethnicity.  Whites are never offended by being called a racial and ethnic &#8220;slur&#8221; because we are intelligent enough to know that the &#8220;slur&#8221; is nothing more than a word that is synonymous for our race or ethniticity.  We feel blessed at having been born white and anytime a minority acknowledges the fact that we are white it fills us with pride.  Blacks and browns, on the other hand, are filled with self-loathing at being a minority in a white nation and they reflexively react with hostility to any perceived racial or ethnic &#8220;slur&#8221; uttered by a white.  We do however have something called The First Amendment that gives us the right to free speech and if minorities don&rsquo;t approve of our choice of words they should leave the country&hellip;   </p>
