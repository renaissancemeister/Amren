						<p>The University of Notre Dame is condemning as racist letters sent to students at three dorms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot let this kind of hatred go unrebutted, particularly on this campus dedicated to the Christian principle of unity and equality of all humans under a loving God who cherishes each of us,&#8221; said an e-mail sent Friday by the Rev. John Jenkins, university president and the Rev. Mark Poorman, vice president for student affairs, to all Notre Dame students, faculty and staff.</p>
<p>The e-mail was in response to letters, signed by a man who gives his address as from Pembina, N.D., that claim blacks on average are less intelligent than whites. The letter tells readers to send $2 to him at a post office box in Pembina, N.D. to receive more information.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dennis Brown, a university spokesman, said Monday the school has referred the incident to the postal inspector, but he doesn&rsquo;t know if there is anything more the university can do.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a free speech issue,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There were no threats made. It was just insulting and wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There was no specific mention of Notre Dame in the letters and they were not targeted to minority students. The letters were mailed to &#8220;occupant&#8221; at the dorm addresses. A total of 768 undergraduates live in the three dorms. Notre Dame, a Roman Catholic University, has about 8,370 undergraduate students, of whom about 4 percent are black.</p>
<p>Similar letters signed by the same man were sent to 354 students at Ohio State University last April, a spokesman there said. He did not know if those letters were referred to the postal inspector.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Let there be no question that there is no place for such bigotry at Notre Dame,&#8221; [Jenkins and Poorman] said.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s not a single thing the postal inspector&rsquo;s office can do about this unless the North Dakota sender defrauded remitters of money and it shouldn&rsquo;t waste any time posturing or pontificating on the matter absent probable cause of making a fraud case. It would be very illuminating to know just how many students sent their two bucks to North Dakota and what was sent back to them.</p>
<p>If this North Dakota person wishes to continue in this endeavor, might I suggest that he do Columbia and Duke Universities next.</p>

			<p>Did they check whether he is a Canadian from Manitoba?  Pembina is a border town and many Canadians from Winnipeg and other nearby places have post office boxes there.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We cannot let this kind of hatred go unrebutted, particularly on this campus dedicated to the Christian principle of unity and equality of all humans under a loving God who cherishes each of us,&rdquo; said an e-mail sent Friday by the Rev. John Jenkins, university president and the Rev. Mark Poorman, vice president for student affairs</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to see that in this case the Rev.s intend to &#8220;rebut&#8221; the claim, rather than simply attack and silence he who dares challenge their cherished belief.</p>
<p>In the spirit of free &amp; open debate, wherein the love of truth is evidence of love for people; for: &#8220;The truth shall make you free.&#8221; (John 8:23)</p>
<p>Does Christianity not demand that it&rsquo;s adherents be wise as serpents, though harmless as doves?  And this, for the very purpose as most likely motivates many here: to remain ignorant is dangerous.  (Matthew 10:16) </p>
<p>However, is it not the case that many of our universities are not only quite willfully suppressing evidence we have of differences between various groups of people?  Not only that, but actively engage in promoting falsehoods and myths that endanger those who believe them?</p>
<p>What is good or loving about that?</p>
<p>There may be some hatred evident in this case, but I&rsquo;d bet that it is provoked by the bigotry of these institutions against white people.  </p>
<p>For example:<br>
Is it not bigotry when universities do not even accept white students, in favor of non-white students with lower grades &amp; lower scores on admissions tests? </p>
<p>I certainly hope that the problem of racism against white people will also be properly addressed by the good Revs.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I will be surprised if they do. </p>

			<p>This is a very big problem for anti-racists.  The truth about black IQ and violence is out in the public domain now.  In seconds, anyone who cares to, can find out the truth via the internet.  More and more people are now taking these things for granted.  Not yet willing to say so openly, MANY people are saying so privately.  Very soon now, the majority of people will know these things.  And they won&rsquo;t listen to liberal anti-racialists anymore.</p>
<p>University of Notre Dame officials might find themselves dismissed from their positions.  People who&rsquo;ve been tricked tend to be vindictive, and have long memories.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Jenkins and Poorman said the letters are a reminder that &#8220;hatred and intolerance still exist and still try to poison our common life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letters are a reminder that people like you two do not want others to know the truth, and any hatred and intolerance exhibited in this incident is from both of you, because you&rsquo;re intolerant of opposing view points and you hate anybody that isn&rsquo;t as naive as you are.  </p>
<p>Notre Dame needs new leadership, just as many other decadent universities do.  To them free speech means anything that supports their fantasies, and hate speech is anything that reveals the truth.</p>
<p>In this regard not only universities, but the ACLU, the ADL, and the SPLC are all hate groups who believe that their brand of mind control should be given free reign to spew their filthy lies.  <br>

<p>Give me a break.  How is it &#8220;hatred&#8221; to state the facts?  And of course we all know that God &#8220;cherishes each of us&#8221;?  What does that have to do with IQ differences?  My husband is smarter than me, and of course that doesn&rsquo;t mean God loves him more than me.  It just is what it is.  If blacks would stop demanding special treatment and blaming their circumstances on &#8220;racism&#8221; we would need to raise the IQ issue in order to defend ourselves from reverse discrimination.  The Rev.  is using faith to pander to the PC campus mob.  <br>

			<p>This is not bigotry.  It&rsquo;s fact.  And facts are stubborn things.  You can&rsquo;t expect to disprove the fact that blacks have lower IQs with appeals to the Creator, because God gave us reason so that we might learn the truth.</p>
<p>God does not ask us to be ignorant of information on IQ differences in order to be faithful followers.  The Church has always been supportive of rationalism.  To toss it aside when it offends you is massively ignorant.</p>

			<p>We ND fans don&rsquo;t give a damn about how dumb or smart the blacks are.  Every body knows that blacks, on average, are not as smart as whites.  Remember the great Paul Horning (1957).  He was the best.  He let slip publicly that the blacks were not as smart as the whites, but he was kind enough to overlook that fact and let them play at ND anyway.  For that loving act ND fired him from his sportscaster job.  Very hateful and unchristian of ND. </p>
<p>Catholic colleges have fallen off from the glory days when they devoted time to telling students how good it was to be a Catholic and how wrong the Protestants, Moslems, Jews, and atheists were.  It&rsquo;s part of a post VacII attitude taken up by many wimpy Catholics, of the Ted Kennedy, Mario Cuomo, Rudy Giuliani variety, and their respected bishops, of don&rsquo;t offend, be happy, agree with whatever hate filled anti-Catholics claim is wrong with the Church.</p>
<p>In 1519 Johann Eck debated Martin Luther.  A ND that respected the Catholic tradition of disputation would invite the author of the supposed false tract to the University to defend his thesis.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Under a loving God&#8221; are the key words here.  Just because there&rsquo;s equality &#8220;under a loving God&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s equality in all other venues, nor does it mean that discussing said inequalities is un-Christian.</p>

			<p>Liberalism is dead.  Free inquiry, which used to be an absolute in their hierarchy of values, is squashed without a whimper of objection.  Aside from a few ineffective, graying gentlemen, &#8220;liberals&#8221; are all cultural Marxists, enemies of their own country.  It&rsquo;s down to corporate capitalists, the Reds, and us.  Everyone else is a clueless spectator.  </p>

			<p>Excuse me, but no place in the Bible does it say that &#8220;GOD&#8221; is a loving god. It says the very opposite.</p>
<p>Also, in no place in the Bible does it say all races (tribes) are equal in the eyes of God. Sorry. It says the opposite. This very same God, of the Bible, told his people to kill ALL the other tribes as the invaded and conquered the land &#8220;promised&#8221; to God&rsquo;s people, and only his people. </p>

			<p>Science cannot be racist. Despite hysterical attempts to silence world renowed scientists such as James Watson, the data on average IQ differences among races always show these differences exist and cannot be changed despite the continued wasting of hundreds of billions of taxpayer money.</p>

<p>Christianity - which is based around belief in the supernatural - is the opposite of rationalism. Its actualy more rational to believe in ghosts than in god, since you might actually observe a ghost for yourself and thus experimentally verify the existence of such, while god is only a theorethical construct. The age of enlightement was one long struggle against christianity, and the church has never supported rationality. Its not surprising that christians so easily take the step into beliving in multiculturalism, its after all a closely related religion with similar dogma.</p>

			<p>Up until about 1950, it was universally accepted that Africans were mentally inferior to all other races. Encyclopedias even made reference to their low intellect. Then everything changed, and it was considered racist to acknowledge what was obviously true. Now it&rsquo;s about to be considered a crime. What can we do to reverse this trend when the truth is not only banished, but can put one in jail?</p>

			<p>It is clear that the historic Christian doctrine of Election, which is summed up in the Pauline phrase, &#8220;Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated,&rsquo; plays NO part in the modern Catholic &#8216;Church,&rsquo; when idiotic statements such as this are uttered by Notre Dame&rsquo;s President:</p>

<p>God is NOT a Unitarian, and He is NOT an Egalitarian.<br>

			<p>I beleive the correct spelling for this city is Pembine SD. I used to work with a woman who was fromn this area in South Dakota and if I recall correctly this is a very small town. It appears to me that who ever is sending these E-Mails is probably not sending them from Pembine. Given the size of Pembine it should not be that difficult to discover who is doing this if they E-Mails were actually originating there. Based on the fact that the name of the city is mis-spelled this may be a false flag operation being perpetrated by a black, just as I suspect many of the so called &#8220;noose incidents&#8221; are.</p>

			<p>Kudos to whomever sent the letters.  It created exactly the kind of uproar that helps promote racial realism.  As leftists would say, it &#8220;heightened the contradictions.&#8221;  So, Univ. of Notre Dame is &#8220;dedicated to the Christian principle of unity and equality of all humans.&#8221;  Oh, how nice!  I suppose that means they have no admissions standards, because all humans are equal, right? </p>

			<p>I checked my atlas, and find no Pembine in South Dakota, but there is a Pembina in North Dakota, population 642. It is (as someone already said) a border crossing, and probably little else, on the way to Winnipeg. I agree that it is certainly a strange location for these to be coming from. Something is fishy.</p>

			<p>Catholic colleges have fallen off from the glory days when they devoted time to telling students how good it was to be a Catholic and how wrong the Protestants, Moslems, Jews, and atheists were. It&rsquo;s part of a post VacII attitude taken up by many wimpy Catholics, of the Ted Kennedy, Mario Cuomo, Rudy Giuliani variety, and their respected bishops, of don&rsquo;t offend, be happy, agree with whatever hate filled anti-Catholics claim is wrong with the Church.</p>
<p>In 1519 Johann Eck debated Martin Luther. A ND that respected the Catholic tradition of disputation would invite the author of the supposed false tract to the University to defend his thesis. </p>

<p>I agree. I was raised a Catholic and today&rsquo;s Church has more similarities between Communism than Christianity. The names that have protected our People in the past have always been Catholic. The Crusaders, Charles Martel and even William Wallace. Today&rsquo;s Church needs a make-over.  </p>

			<p>The Bell Curve, anybody? Stories such as these have become so common place they&rsquo;ve lost their shock value. By now, most intelligent Americans are well aware than the ultra PC principle has replaced common sense and trumped science on college campuses across the country. And that is most especially true of Catholic-based colleges and universities. I&rsquo;m a graduate of a small one in Pennsylvania and it&rsquo;s as ultra left as UC Berkeley ever was. </p>

			<p>Of course, this is not the first time Christians have resisted scientific truth. The classic conflicts have been the heliocentric model of the solar system and Darwin&rsquo;s theory. The latter issue is in fact still current with a large number of Protestants in the US.  Those previous conflicts were really conflicts between biblical passages and a scientific discoveries. As difficult as they may have been, they don&rsquo;t really cut to the heart of the religion, because those kinds of conflicts can always be dispensed with by reinterpreting the biblical passage.</p>
<p>I think this equalitarian stand by ND represents something more troubling than those classic conflicts. Denying IQ differences is contradicting science. But the point is that IQ differences DO NOT contradict any biblical passage, nor any theological principle, nor anything else in the Judeo-Christian tradition. What IQ differences contradict is something OUTSIDE Christianity, the system of thought comprising Political Correctness, Multiculturalism, etc. In the view of many us here, this system is highly irrational and immoral. Yet, for the MSM, it is not only acceptable, it is THE &#8220;moral&#8221; system, the &#8220;morality&#8221; which has in fact replaced Christianity.</p>
<p>When Christian authorities speak the immoral language of political correctness, it is not merely another conflict with science; it is no less than the defeat of Christianity itself. We are so accustomed to hearing the PC language that we are desensitized. But it should be no less shocking to hear political correctness from the mouth of priest, than to hear him quote Sharia law and wish peace upon the prophet Mohammad. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to Notre Dame but have been inside De Paul University&rsquo;s downtown campus in Chicago.  If those schools are &#8216;catholic&rsquo; then I&rsquo;ve got a bridge I can sell you cheap.  De Paul has removed all the crucifixes from its classrooms so it won&rsquo;t offend the students who seem to come from most countries other than the United States.  These schools are bastions of affirmative action policies and of course, in order to keep those federal dollars coming in, accept minority students who probably couldn&rsquo;t pass the entrance exams without the school doing their usual race norming on the results.  </p>
<p>Calling Notre Dame or De Paul or even Loyola Universities Roman Catholic schools of higher learning is a joke.  Their chapels look like something you would find in a Motel 6.</p>

			<p>Those students who received the letters should save their two dollars. It is a scientific fact that blacks, on average, have lower IQs than whites.  Too bad the &#8220;learned&#8221; ones at ND do not understand that.</p>

<p>Bravo, Tesseract. I concur. And so do many others:</p>

<p>&#8220;The ancient fathers&hellip;were concerned that the ties of kinship itself should not be loosened as generation succeeded generation, should not diverge too far, so that they finally ceased to be ties at all. And so for them it was a matter of religion to restore the bond of kinship by means of the marriage tie before kinship became too remote &mdash; to call kinship back, as it were, as it disappeared into the distance.&#8221; ~ St. Augustine, City of God, book XV, Ch. 16</p>
<p>And the &#8216;scientists&rsquo; are being outed as to their religions prejudices, finally!</p>

<p>No, Notre Dame&rsquo;s position is &#8216;absolutely null and utterly void&rsquo; when it comes to historic catholicism.<br>

			<p>FREE SPEECH AND TRUTH = CIVILIZATION; OPPOSING THEM = LIBBARBARIANISM.</p>
<p>I think the students at Notre Dame should understand that the letter writer speaks the truth when he says that blacks have lower IQ&rsquo;s.  Second, the writer is exercising his basic human right, the right to freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Both of these characterisitics  &mdash;  speaking the truth and freedom of speech, are values cherished in any civilized society.  In my opinion, those who stand up against them are the antithesis of civilized society  &mdash;  they are libbarbarians.  </p>
<p>I think the authorities at Notre Dame risk being labelled as libbarbarians if they attack truth and free speech.</p>
