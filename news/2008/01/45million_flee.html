						<p>AS many as 4.5million people have fled London and the South East in the past ten years in search of a better quality of life and an escape from crowds, crime and grime.</p>
<p>Many were families who used the profit they made on their houses to move to the coast or the country. Villages in the South West of England proved particularly attractive.</p>
<p>The leavers were replaced by a larger number of migrants from other parts of the UK and overseas, mainly young single people chasing work, giving the region a net population gain of 384,000.</p>
<p>The figures, compiled from official sources by the Halifax, also point to a change to the ethnic mix of major urban centres, where minority communities make up a growing proportion of the population.</p>
<p>Birmingham, for example, saw a net fall in its British origin population of 61,000 over the ten-year period. Some analysts predict that next year the city, which has a large Asian community, will be the first in the UK that no longer has a majority white population.</p>
<p>The figures show 2.4million people left London between 1996 and 2006. A further 2.1million moved out of the South East.</p>
<p>While the capital has long been a magnet for young people from other parts of the UK, in recent years these incomers have failed to make up for the exodus of Londoners. As a result, London&rsquo;s &#8220;British&#8221; population fell by 608,000, which was the greatest net loss seen in any part of the country.</p>
<p>However the loss was more than offset by the arrival of a million people in the capital from overseas over the past decade.</p>
<p>Many have come from Eastern Europe, particularly Poland, following the expansion of the European Union.</p>
<p>London&rsquo;s total population has increased by 538,000 since 1996, which was the biggest increase seen by any part of the country.</p>
<p>Coastal areas overall have seen the biggest increases in net internal migration. The South West saw a net increase of 441,000 in the population since 1996, far more than any other part of the country.</p>
<p>Halifax chief economist, Martin Ellis, said: &#8220;Sixteen of the 20 local authorities with the highest levels of net internal migration since 1997 are coastal areas. People are moving in large numbers to enjoy the benefits of living near the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>In rural Britain, the East Riding of Yorkshire recorded the biggest net gain from internal migration. Some 112,000 arrived compared with the 87,000 who left &mdash; a net increase of 25,300.</p>
<p>Only the cities of the North East of England, including Newcastle, Sunderland and Middlesbrough, saw an overall population decline between 1996 and 2006.</p>
<p>The figure fell by 20,000 as young people moved away in search of work and a new life.</p>
<p>Figures published by the Office of National Statistics earlier this week reveal that England is about to become the most crowded country in Europe.</p>
<p>They show that in England in 2005 there were 387 people for every square kilometre, and this rose to 390 per square kilometre in 2006. This is around 620 per mile.</p>
<p>The population density in England is almost double that of Germany and four times the figure of France.</p>
<p>Mr Ellis said: &#8220;The figures do show a flight from cities and urban centres to more rural locations and the seaside. Many will be people with children who are looking for a more family-friendly quality of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t have a demographic breakdown as to who is going, but it will include a number of middle-aged and older people who have made money from the property market.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will be looking to buy a larger property outside London, some will aim to move to an area where they can live mortgage free.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a natural life-cycle going on. Young single people will gravitate towards cities, but as people marry and have children they look for larger homes and space.&#8221;</p>

<p>These people are fleeing people who a different race than themselves because, on a genetic level, they understand that different races can&rsquo;t live together in harmony.</p>

			<p>Well, on the plus side, there&rsquo;s so many &#8220;differing ethnicities&#8221; in London that Britain won&rsquo;t go through a &#8220;Kosovo&#8221; situation.</p>
<p>But how long will it be &#8216;til economic&hellip;&#8221;difficulties&#8221; (i.e. another &#8220;Great Depression&#8221; - and from all portents it seems like it&rsquo;s about to hit), the British Government becomes so emasculated and London becomes at least 90% non-white before the Indians decide that, frankly, they&rsquo;re tired of the Pakistanis in &#8220;their&#8221; neighbourhood? The Jamaicans simmering at the increased presence of blacks straight from Africa?</p>
<p>But yes, Britain &#8220;obviously&#8221; needs more non-whites - I&rsquo;ve heard the Filipino community needs to be &#8220;fleshened&#8221; out a bit!</p>

			<p>&ldquo;There is a natural life-cycle going on. Young single people will gravitate towards cities, but as people marry and have children they look for larger homes and space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nonsense.  For a thousand years Londoners have lived their whole lives in the City, growing up, marrying, raising children, and dying. Only since WWII and, more recently, the Blair government have they been forced to flee, primarily for reasons of safety and cost due to the massive migrations to London. </p>
<p>London is no longer London, it is a junior league cesspit, a New York wannabe.</p>
<p>The author is right in one respect, though.  All the beautiful people who flock to Manhattan, congregate there to get drunk, get laid, and marry an investment banker.  They all intend to leave and move elsewhere when they have kids.  New York and now London are not &#8220;cities&#8221; in the traditional sense of the word, but gigantic meat markets for the elite and sweatshops for illegal aliens.  there is nothing more washed up and tragic as a middle-aged unmarried Manhattan woman living in some shoebox &#8220;apartment&#8221; as small as a dormitory room who congratulates herself each year with creeping desperation that she is the cool one, the hip one, for staying in and getting old in New York.  I suspect London is the same.</p>

			<p>Halifax chief economist: &ldquo;There is a natural life-cycle going on. Young single people will gravitate towards cities, but as people marry and have children they look for larger homes and space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is nothing natural in replacing the British population with immigrants. The natural thing would be to fight the invasion. White people tend to postpone having children until they have a decent job and can afford a larger home. But immigrants will make lots of babies even when they have only small jobs and live in cramped conditions. Their children will be considered &#8220;underpriveleged&#8221; and will require special attention from us, while we&rsquo;ll have fewer children of our own, due to overcrowding, bad schools and widespread crime. Government and the media will then give praise to the immigrants for taking the jobs we won&rsquo;t do and having the babies we won&rsquo;t have. Thank you immigrants, for displacing us!</p>

			<p>This is not a &#8220;natural life-cycle&#8221; as the Halifax&rsquo;s chief economic dullard opines but ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>Mainly young foreigners (of breeding age) are replacing the fleeing indigenous population.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple. Why isn&rsquo;t this front-pafe news? (No - don&rsquo;t answer that question. We all know why!)</p>

<p>I agree provided these primarily Eastern European immigrants do not attempt to form an ethnic enclave. Either fully assimilate into your host nation or stay home. </p>

			<p>It pains me to see what&rsquo;s happening to England.  Have you seen that NEW movie trailor for some medieval war movie (forgot its name) where there are black medieval warriors?  I&rsquo;m not sure that they&rsquo;re knights but the setting is definitely Europe (England) and castles. They gotta stick token black guys into everything don&rsquo;t they?</p>

			<p>Why are the Slavic countries the only ones left on the European continent who will actually take action to defend their territories? I know that Vladimir Putin is a potential threat to the world, but you must give the guy credit for taking action to increase the Russian natality rate.</p>
<p>The West could really learn from the Mother Country. At least in Russia they will hire special police forces to track down and expell foreign threats. It is a little bit frightening to know that Russia is the only country on this planet who is taking action to improve their survival into the next century.</p>
<p>The idea of ethnopolitics/biopolitics is still forbidden in the U.S. and Europe.</p>

<p> Putin is not a threat to the world. He does not go along with the neoconservative project for the new American century script but that hardly makes him a threat. Opposing American &#8220;benovolent&#8221; global hegemony hardly makes you a threat.</p>

			<p>To the anonymous poster (12:29PM) who objects to the term &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; where no overt bloodshed occurs in the replacement of the indigenous population, I think that you are making a distinction without a relevant difference.</p>
<p>What does it matter ultimately HOW the indigenous population of a nation or region is replaced, just so long as it is? </p>
<p>Also, why should the term &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; require that murder and bloodshed occur?</p>
<p>It is typical of sociocultural Marxists (of whom the anonymous poster is presumably one) to employ such techniques of terminological obfuscation, and the duty of those who oppose them to expose such dishonest modes of argument.</p>
<p>Finally, what guarantee can our anonymous prophet give us that the murder and bloodshed that he/she believes to be constitutive of &#8220;true&#8221; ethnic cleansing (as opposed to the inauthentic bloodless variety) will not occur at some future date, when the balance of ethnicities is even less favourable to the indigenous population of Great Britain (and especially England)?</p>

			<p>Beginning in the sixties Western universities began indoctrinating white females that overpopulation would lead to the end of humanity and it was therefore their responsibility to have few to no children and save mankind from extinction.  Robert Ehrlich published &#8220;The Population Bomb&#8221; to support this AlGorian alarmist drivel and it became required reading for impressionable idealistic young minds.  White population growth entered into immediate decline while the black population at home and aboard, along with the rest of the third-world, continued rising with a vengeance.  Third-world places such as Mexico perceived their Population Bomb as a weapon to be dropped on America and the perpetual damage from that ongoing explosion is being felt today in every community in America.  It is time we defused that bomb, haul away the ruble and build anew&hellip;<br>

			<p>While I was in the USAF I was told by an authority that there will be a nuclear war in my lifetime (33 years ago).  I did not have children partly due to this forecast.  I think alot of folks my age figured why bother having a family only to be destroyed by a nuke.  War has scarred whites beyond comprehension, especially Britain.</p>

			<p>Nuclearfamily:  Unfortunately the minorities have never shared your fears and continued breeding with a vengeance.  A nuclear war would not obliterate all life on the planet so your fears were largely ungrounded.  People of all ages are constantly threatened with death from countless sources, yet we somehow persevere and the vast majority of us survive.  Children are the greatest blessing a couple can share and in my opinion to not have them in ones life is a loss beyond comprehension&hellip;            </p>

Sad.  It&rsquo;s unclear whether or not you now regret this.  I wonder.  At any rate, if we look at human history, there was hardly EVER a time when war or some other calamity did not loom on the horizon. When did people NOT have any poblems? If people had put off having children when conditions weren&rsquo;t ideal, they would be no human beings alive today.  When were conditions ever ideal?</p>
<p>Well, at least there wouldn&rsquo;t be any humans of the type that worry about the future and  try to plan ahead.  There would be only the utterly improvident who can&rsquo;t think beyond tomorrow and don&rsquo;t care anyway.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that no one can accurately foresee the future. We just have to do the best we can and plod ahead somehow. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m against birth control.  No one really knows what&rsquo;s coming. You can&rsquo;t predict.  You have to go right on with your life, no matter what.  Oddly, humanity always seems to get by.  We&rsquo;ve survived terrible things, but we&rsquo;ve gotten through five million years so far. We are survivors.</p>
