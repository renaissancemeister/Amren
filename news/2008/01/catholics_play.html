						<p>At a Catholic-run shelter just across the border from Laredo, Texas, dozens of Latin American migrants say grace and tuck into a hearty meal of sausages, beans and rice, before trying to swim across the Rio Grande into the United States.</p>
<p>Weary migrants on their journey north often recharge their batteries at a network of similar shelters run by the Roman Catholic Church &mdash; a lifeline sanctioned by the Vatican, despite increased U.S. efforts to keep out illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Migration is a human right and migrants are some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable people. It is the church&rsquo;s obligation to help them,&#8221; said the Rev. Francisco Pellizzari, an Italian-Argentine missionary who runs the Nazareth migrant shelter in Nuevo Laredo.</p>
<p>The Nuevo Laredo shelter has been granted a papal blessing in a Vatican certificate that hangs proudly on the wall.</p>

<p>The Nuevo Laredo shelter has been granted a papal blessing in a Vatican certificate that hangs proudly on the wall.</p>
<p>Many Catholic Churches in the United States have welcomed Hispanics, with some seeing their congregations double in size. They set up soup kitchens and offer support to families hit by workplace raids and deportations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ANGER AT CATHOLIC CHURCH</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many religious conservatives in the United States take a sharply contrasting view of immigration from that of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Some are angry that the Catholic Church helps people who break the law. Others accuse it of using support for immigration as a way to win back members as the church loses ground to evangelicals and secularism in Latin America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Without the shelters in Mexico, most migrants would be forced to beg for food, sleep on streets, in the hot sun and freezing cold of the desert or on the muddy banks of the Rio Grande before attempting to cross.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m extremely grateful for this shelter, but even without it, I would still try to get across,&#8221; said 19-year-old Guatemalan coffee picker Raul Mintis, looking at a map of the United States in the Nuevo Laredo shelter.</p>

			<p>The Catholic church acts no better than a multinational corporation whose bottom line excuses any misdeeds they may do.<br>
The same parishners go to church in Mexico or Central America but they do not bring in the wealth that they do here in the USA. The same person is worth much more to the Church when they are living in a land where their families are given huge benefits such as food stamps,housing, medical care, and welfare checks.</p>

			<p>Catholic clergy never quite gave up part of the flock they lost with emergence of Protestants some six centuries ago. Now, they are making in-roads to the U.S. in their obvious attempt to recapture the lion share of that loss.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t mind the rising Catholicism in the U.S., remember, that if it weren&rsquo;t for Martin Luther and his followers, the Catholic Church and its Inquisition would keep us in the dark ages, as they do to medieval Europe. According to Max Webber, capitalism would not emerge, and the U.S. as we know it, with its individual liberties and unparalleled prosperity, would, most likely, never materialize.</p>
<p>So, beware. Catholics are comming.<br>

			<p>Sad, but a lot of people do not realize the fact that the catholic church is a foreign owned organisation (church or not - the facts are the facts) with its own capital a.k.a. the Vatican. The catholic church does not promote the Gospel of Christ Jesus, but her own selfish aims - which will bring more individuals into the fold and thus more coins into her coffers.</p>
<p>Oh by the way, the catholic church would not mind turning America into a dominant catholic country - this would help her finances greatly! </p>
<p>The friendly priest probably doesn&rsquo;t mind harboring illegals, as long as he is gratified for his trouble.</p>

			<p>As one born into a Catholic family, I am sickened by the communist tendencies of the church nowadays.  </p>
<p>Brotherhood of man has been equated to racial oneness, and charity to others has become socialistic wealth redistribution. In acting on their beliefs, they&rsquo;ve become treasonous law-breakers.</p>
<p>This church has lost its way, if it ever had it.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed in American Renaissance.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church is not what the Anti-Catholic owners of the Reuters news service says it is.  (I wonder who&rsquo;s behind Reuters.)  Furthermore who the hell is Robin Emmott?  What is he or she selling?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many Catholic Churches in the United States have welcomed Hispanics, with some seeing their congregations double in size.&rdquo; </p>
<p> Many?  Give me a number!  I&rsquo;ve never met a Catholic who wants Hispanics in his parish.  Getting some poor Hispanics into the church on Sunday is not going to return the Church in America to the glory of pre Vatican II days.  To be honest having the poor Hispanics drain the parish of funds is not a prospect any pastor looks forward to.  </p>
<p>The article is anti-Catholic propaganda pure and simple.  What some nobody, (Rev. Francisco Pellizzar), thinks to be Church&rsquo;s teachings, is not the necessarily Church&rsquo;s teachings.    Whenever some Pope, Cardinal, Bishop, priest or nun pops off on politics, immigration, or women fashion he is not speaking for the Church.  This is a simple fact that every one should know.  And with minimum effort American Renaissance could find out.</p>
<p>Even if the Anti-Catholic Reuters and Emmott are ignorant of Church teachings and positions, that fact does not excuse American Renaissance ignorance in such matters.  We hold American Renaissance to a higher standard.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no excuse for American Renaissance not catching the nutty &ldquo;papal blessing in a Vatican certificate that hangs proudly on the wall&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Give me a break.  If this attack of misinformation and lies were written against another more belligerent religion, ethnic group, or race American Renaissance would rightly not print it!<br>

			<p>As a lifelong Catholic, I can firmly say that the majority of white Catholics in the US do not support the violation of our laws and borders by the millions of illegals streaming into this country.  I&rsquo;m quite sure that most white Catholics would be the first to vote for the immediate deportation of these aliens in our midst.</p>

			<p>The Catholic Church is unique among churches in that it is a genuine political power, and always has and always will promote its own interests first and foremost with the aim of winning more souls to it and consolidating its power - spiritual AND political power.  Nonetheless, as one person above noted, in our age the CC has itself not escaped Communist influence and I think this news story is a good anecdotal example of that.</p>

			<p>I concur with Noctura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ve never met a Catholic who wants Hispanics in his parish. Getting some poor Hispanics into the church on Sunday is not going to return the Church in America to the glory of pre Vatican II days. To be honest having the poor Hispanics drain the parish of funds is not a prospect any pastor looks forward to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My church has &ldquo;reached out&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Hispanic community&rdquo; and basically anyone who is non-white, and here is where we are at&hellip;.</p>
<p>At our latest Pastoral council meeting we were discussing the dire financial position of our Parish, that not ten years before had been firmly financially stable.  (This is pretty much true of any Catholic parish in urban areas.)  The priest (a total Hispano-phile) came in late and the first thing that come gushing out is &ldquo;Can you believe it? We&rsquo;re now more than 50% Hispanic!&rdquo;  (His eyes were all starry at this!)<br>
My response was, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great Father&hellip;, but they only contribute toward 7% of total income!&rdquo;  I&rsquo;ll remember the expression on his face after that, heartbreak, then the eyes like daggers.  Good times!</p>
<p>White Catholics are in the same boat as everyone else, we are controlled by the few PC people in the church that think they have &ldquo;absolute truth&rdquo; on their side, just like the Muslim fanatics.  On top of that, the cultural Marxism, this will inflict &ldquo;righteous anger&rdquo; or ostracism of the group on anyone who doesn&rsquo;t tow the PC/ multi-cult line.  I know I am suspect, in many people&rsquo;s eyes, for my (very restrained) public viewpoints. But I&rsquo;ll be doing the white-flight, like everyone else, to a new parish, in an outlying area, where &ldquo;you know who&rdquo; will move to, and it will all happen again!</p>
<p>I am angry my church has gone from a beautiful 1910 gothic revival building into a beat-up, worn-down, south of the border chicken-coop!  All in a period of 10 years!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They kill us with our love&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

			<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church is no different: Their growth worldwide results from third world converts mostly outside the U.S. but, particularly in places like their Mecca, Loma Linda, in the U.S. as well. Its all about revenue Period.</p>
<p>This serves the corporate and therefore government agenda and that is why such 501(c)(3) non-profit corporate &#8220;churches&#8221; are given tax-exempt status. Try taking a non-PC position in your church and you&rsquo;ll be branded a political action committee and end-up taxed.</p>

			<p>The Catholic Church has become very corrupt in the current age.  One way to solve this problem would be for the US to simply bribe the church to change its policy.  For enough cash, they could be convinced to proclaim that breaking another county&rsquo;s immigration laws is sinful and to be punished by excommunication.  VERY effective deterrent to law breakers.  They&rsquo;d stab their own mothers for a single crack rock, but don&rsquo;t dare disobey the church.</p>

			<p>Some Catholic organizations are actively involved with transporting people from the third world into developed nations like the US, Canada, Australia and the European countries.</p>
<p>Hopefully the directors of these programs will get robbed someday by the people they brought over.</p>
<p>&#8220;<br>
I have mainly worked with the refugee resettlement programmes of the US, Australia and Canada. In Europe, the only resettlement programme I was in contact with was the Finnish programme, which has offered resettlement to some Sudanese refugees out of Egypt. I remember that many of those refugees were first somehow reluctant and cautious about the idea of settling in Finland. But after a first group of refugees did travel there, positive feedback returned to the refugees still in Egypt and their opinion on the issue changed; the refugees were actually getting quite excited about the idea of going to Finland.</p>

&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last July, the Deferral Team organised a special meeting in a pleasant but deprived secondary school of Mtabila refugee camp with 300 heads of family all belonging to the &lsquo;72 Burundians Group&rsquo; who represent more than 1300 refugees. My coordinator gave me the opportunity to announce officially to all these refugees that they have been successfully admitted by US Government. Just one second after this magic sentence &ldquo;Congratulations! You have been accepted to the US&rdquo; the audience started to applaud, cry and laugh. At last, some happiness and hope in the refugee camp!</p>
<p>I will definitely keep in my mind this day in July. I just hope that one day, I would have the opportunity to call for another such meeting and declare to the refugees gathered, who have suffered greatly for decades, suffered too much: &ldquo;Bienvenue en Europe!&rdquo;. </p>

			<p>P. Noctura, what planet have you been living on. I live in a large midwestern city and the Catholic Church in my city makes no effort  to disguise it&rsquo;s support for illegal immigration and illegal immigrants. They even have several immigration lawyers on their payroll to facilitate illegal immigration through the court system. They also make no effort to conceal the fact that their support is all about filling the pews that have been emptied by the church&rsquo;s sex abuse scandals. </p>
<p>I was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended a catholic grade school. I no longer attend the Catholic Church becasue of it&rsquo;s support for illegal immigration and it&rsquo;s deep involvement int he refugee scam business. The Catholic Church actually recruits third world refugees from africa and asia to bring into the country and place here. They make millions of dollars a year off of this scam at the expense of the country and US citizens who tax dollars are not only paying the church to place these people in the UIS but are supporting them with welfare and free healthcare once they get here.</p>

			<p>The Roman Catholic church has ever been an enemy of our race. If you&rsquo;re offended at such a comment I&rsquo;d just like you to try to come to terms with meshing a Nationalist Political view with an admitted &#8216;Universalist&rsquo; Church.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let not the Pope and his followers claim to have done a great service to the German nation by the gift of this Roman Empire. First because the Pope has sought not to give us the Imperial sovereignty, but to arrogate it to himself, in order to subjugate all our power, freedom, property, bodies and souls, and through us (had God not prevented it) the whole world.&#8221; - Martin Luther</p>

			<p>The catholic church is no longer (if ever) about religion, but, is a huge money making corporation with a tax exempt status. The Vatican is more concerned with wealth, as it is, one of the largest landowners in the world and it is all TAX FREE. The Vatican sees the Illegal criminal aliens as money in the bank as they come to America and go to work and pay tithes to the church as repayment for the charity and sanctuary given on both sides of the border, after all the only people that benefit from religion are the ones on the receiving end of the donation plate.</p>
<p>The catholic church should lose their tax exempt status and be prosecuted for aiding and abetting criminals to break the law.</p>

<p>What is the Catholic Church suppose to do? Be a proponent of closed borders? The media would have a field day with the Church on this.</p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me that people who wouldn&rsquo;t dream of criticizing Judaism take great joy at bashing the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>What is the Anglican Church doing about mass immigration into England?</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The Catholic Church is a huge money making machine&rdquo; and capitalism &ldquo;would never have been developed without Protestantism.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This contradiction is amazing.</p>
<p>In fact, capitalism had its earliest beginnings in the monasteries of northern Italy in the ninth century. Monasteries were initially self-sufficient – they produced everything they needed to live on. Gradually with the increase in productivity (due to the meteorological warming trend of the Middle Ages, increase in population, and increase in productivity), they began to specialize and sell their excess for profit and to buy what else they needed. So successful were they that they became in fact large banks that even loaned to nobility. Cash transactions (in lieu of barter) spread rapidly, and Italian banks soon were opened as far away as England and Ireland because the increase in trade throughout Europe made transporting shipments of hard cash a risky affair. To solve that problem, they created a certificate of transfer to pay for things bought from distant regions. By no later than the 13th Century, leading Christian theologians had fully debated the primary aspects of emerging capitalism – profits, property rights, credit, lending, and the like. All this led to the concept of the mortgage (&ldquo;dead pledge&rdquo;) about the same time. </p>
<p>Thus, capitalism spread all over central Europe, especially to the Low Countries centuries before Martin Luther.</p>

			<p>While the Catholic Church is heavily complicit in helping illegal immigration, many non-Catholics are as well, including Jews, Evangelicals, and plenty of socialist atheists.  Folks like Mike Huckabee represent the other brand of immigration traitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;For those who don&rsquo;t mind the rising Catholicism in the U.S., remember, that if it weren&rsquo;t for Martin Luther and his followers, the Catholic Church and its Inquisition would keep us in the dark ages, as they do to medieval Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for the Catholic Church, Martin Luther would not have believed in the Gospel because the Church is the Rock, established by Christ, and it saved the Gospel for mankind.  Catholics throughout the ages have been instrumental in science, mathematics, astronomy, art, and music.  The Renaissance began in Italy, a Catholic nation.  One good example is a Briton named St. Bede.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede</a></p>
<p>Before we toss out ridiculous generalizations, remember that nations existed for over a thousand years under the Church while still remaining white nations.  France, Italy, Poland, Ireland.  Nations like these were capable of maintaining their identities just fine while still remaining heavily Catholic.  Only recently has the Church adopted some of the foolish social justice teachings that it has, and yes, I would stand with anyone who opposes that.</p>

<p>Yeah, right, about as much as Al Gore was &#8220;instrumental&#8221; in development of the Internet.</p>
<p>It was a simple co-incidence that several discoveries were made in countries that were under Catholic Church&rsquo;s influence, which its bureaucracy (theocracy, if you will) made quite difficult. </p>
<p>Funny that you quoted astronomy despite the fact that Giordano Bruno was burned on stake by the Inquisition (&#8220;political correctness&#8221; police of Catholic Church at that time), Galileo Galilei was forced to publicly denounce his heliocentric theory, and Mikołaj Kopernik, out of fear of being persecuted, did not allow publishing his &#8220;De Revolutionibus &hellip;&#8221; until on his deathbed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fair to assume that if the Catholic Church had its way all the way through the last six centuries, we would be still worshiping Ptolomean naïve theory of the universe, and all those trying to launch space ship or study genetics and heritability would end up burnt on stakes.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m very much against this helping illegal aliens. The thing is though that for some reason, every group of people in power in every mainstream organization in our country is seemingly working against the best interests of our people. This includes the Bishops of the Catholic church. I have no idea how this is.<br>
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s the church, unions, business, govt, etc. Once a person is elevated to a leadership position, he/she is all of a sudden against our best interests. Maybe it&rsquo;s something in the water.</p>

<p>Recently, the Catholic Church loosened its outdated doctrines and does not try to impede progress in science or discourage intellectual inquiry into controversial (in Church&rsquo;s opinion) issues. But then again, you wrote that &#8220;only recently has the Church adopted some of the foolish social justice teachings that it has&#8221;, which seems to contradict your main pouint.</p>
<p>So much for &#8220;ridiculous generalizations&#8221;.<br>

			<p>     The number of Catholics who have made major discoveries is<br>
small compared to Protestants. The Protestant genius is individ-<br>
ualistic and worldly, the Catholic genius, social and other-<br>
worldly. The traditional social teachings of the Church are a<br>
very healthy counter balance to Protestant individualism run<br>
amok. All that changed with Vatican 2 and John Paul the 2nd. His<br>
writings on economics have many similarities with Communism. He<br>
says people have the right to go wherever they want, borders be<br>
damned. And the Church today, like all the Protestant denomin-<br>
ations, pay the barest lip service to borders. Yeah they can<br>
exist but just don&rsquo;t turn anyone away.</p>

			<p>      This article gives voice to what we don&rsquo;t hear too much of these days; anti-catholicsm. Remember there is a deep vein of it that runs throughout American history. That being said there is reason for concern.The criminal Mahoney who covered up for and tolerated pedarasts is great promoter of immigration. This is to get the press off his back with regards to the terrible record of his &#8216;priests&rsquo; as molesters. Of course it has worked, He&rsquo;s being lionized instead of arrested. The church should get back to the gospel,leave politics alone.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no way to prove that.</p>
<p>Mendel (the father of genetics), Copernicus, Galileo, Aquinas, Bede.  These were all major scientists of the Renaissance and prior.  Undoubtedly there have been many great protestants too.</p>
<p>To reject Catholicism&rsquo;s universality is to reject Christianity in general.  Methinks some of the problems folks have with Catholicism is not unique just to that faith.</p>

			<p><b>To John R. Kennedy</b> who posted at 5:27 PM on January 18</p>
<p>Your posts are devoid of any logic (in the proper meaning of this word). </p>
<p>You mention Kopernik and Galileo as examples of Catholic contributions to science, despite the fact that Catholic Church did whatever it could to disrupt their research. It&rsquo;s like crediting communism in Eastern Europe with emergence of  post-Soviet democracies just because people who wrecked the Soviet Empire were citizens of then-communist countries.</p>
<p>Somehow, you forgot to mention Giordano Bruno, an accomplished Catholic philosopher who was burned on stake by Catholic Church&rsquo;s Inquisition for such &ldquo;heresies&rdquo; as Kopernik and Galileo&rsquo;s heliocentric theories, as another example of Catholic accomplishment in science. </p>
<p>Catholic Church gained notoriety for obstructing progress in science and infringements on freedom of intellectual inquiry, and examples of talented and accomplished scientists who (willy-nilly) happened to be Catholic, no matter how numerous, will not change that. It&rsquo;s mainly the dysfunctional and out of touch with reality Catholic Church hierarchy that deserved the blame for this sorry state of affairs, although the Church wouldn&rsquo;t have inflicted so much damage to the Western civilization if it weren&rsquo;t for many individual Catholics that obediently and uncritically carried out absurd doctrines and policies (dictated by the theocracy) that had about as much to do with Christianity as selling indulgencies to affluent sinners had.</p>
<p>And last but not least, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Protestants built the U.S. while Catholics built Mexico. Go and see the difference, pal.<br>

			<p>Why is it that some persons, whenever they hear the lightest criticism of the Church or its practices (however well justified), go into the predictable knee-jerk systerics about &#8220;anti-Catholicism&#8221; and &#8220;Catholic-bashing&#8221;? </p>
<p>Instead of offering a reasoned argument in response, they can only rant about prejudice.  Is all criticism of the Church to be equated with &#8220;prejudice&#8221;?   Apparently so.</p>

			<p>The Catholic who posted the paragraph below, and the many other Catholics who feel the same are being duped by their own church.  It has always been at the forefront in bringing Hispanics into this country.  It has organizations that help Hispanics get welfare and other social benefits.<br>
Back in the late &rsquo;80s or early &rsquo;90s there was an Hispanic orgainzed union attempting to get a decent living wage for the Hispanic gravediggers that the Catholic cemeteries employ.  Cardianl Mahoney fought them tooth-and-nail to continue to be able to exploit the gravediggers.<br>
Foreigners are deliberately brought into the country for the purpose of weakening the workforce so as to exploit them for the cheapest labor they can get.  They don&rsquo;t do it because they care about those people and want to give them the &#8220;American dream.&#8221;  And, they certainly don&rsquo;t care about the rest of us who are supposed to compete with the newest batch of foreigners.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
&#8220;As a lifelong Catholic, I can firmly say that the majority of white Catholics in the US do not support the violation of our laws and borders by the millions of illegals streaming into this country. I&rsquo;m quite sure that most white Catholics would be the first to vote for the immediate deportation of these aliens in our midst.&#8221;</p>

<p>Substitute &#8220;Protestant&#8221; for your use of Catholic.  In England, everyone was Protestant.  All of their discoveries were unrelated to their faith, then, because they had to be Anglican.  If they weren&rsquo;t, they were persecuted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And last but not least, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Protestants built the U.S. while Catholics built Mexico. Go and see the difference, pal.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lesson in American History:</p>
<p>Actually, Catholics built the New World :)  Before a Protestant ever set foot in America, a Catholic named Christopher Columbus discovered the entire continent (when everyone told him the world was flat).  His trip was financed by Ferdinand and Isabella, a couple of &#8220;ignorant&#8221; Catholic monarchs.  Catholics were among the founding fathers of this country.  For this country to be &#8220;built by Protestants,&#8221; you would have to ignore the Carrolls of Maryland; namely, Charles Carroll a signer of the Declaration of Independence.  You would have to ignore the Irish Catholics who fought on both the North and South, as soon as they stepped off the boat.  You might ignore the first Catholic Supreme Court justice, Roger Taney, appointed in 1836.</p>
<p>Catholic judges consistently take conservative positions on matters of importance to White Nationalists.</p>
<p>People like me have no need to make this a battle between Catholics and Protestants because we realize that does no good for the movement.  Catholics comprise a substantial number of WNs.</p>
<p>Anti-Catholic bigotry does nothing for White Nationalists because it relies on a pure and utter misunderstanding of Catholic theology.  Protestant kingdoms were just as brutal to those who did not adhere to their church, lest we forget Elizabeth or James and what they did to Catholics.</p>
