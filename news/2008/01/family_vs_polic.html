<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Six members of a family were arrested at The Mall at Wellington Green in an incident that began last week benignly enough over a pair of droopy jeans but ended like a chaotic scene out of the Cops television show.</p>
<p>An estimated 20 deputies, two canine units and a police helicopter swarmed the area surrounding the mall&rsquo;s food court, shutting down roads, all to arrest a 52-year-old man, his 50-year-old wife and four other relatives, ages 16 to 20, Thursday evening.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the Leger family, a Haitian family which has lived in Wellington since 1992, though, this is no laughing matter. They say sheriff&rsquo;s deputies overreacted with not just their numbers but also with sheer force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t so, deputies say. The family attempted to stop deputies from arresting a relative, which led to the situation spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>&lsquo;COMMON COURTESY&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fracas began around 7 p.m. Thursday when deputies arrested Frantz Leger, the Legers&rsquo; 20-year-old son. He had returned to the mall where he was banned for violating its &#8220;Rules of Common Courtesy&#8221; in or around August. The Florida State University sophomore business major was verboten for wearing his pants too low.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His return to the mall was a violation of that trespass warning, deputies later charged.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mall doesn&rsquo;t put up with that tomfoolery bullcrap,&#8221; Hart said [Palm Beach County sheriff&rsquo;s Lt. Jay Hart] said. &#8220;His pants were down below his butt. No one goes to the mall and wants to see the crack of someone&rsquo;s butt.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marthe Leger was arrested in 1994 on larceny and robbery charges, and Alain Oidge was arrested in October on charges of fraud, driving while his license was suspended and resisting an officer without violence.</p>
<p>The Legers say their Haitian heritage and treatment at the mall are not coincidental. &#8220;We feel like we&rsquo;ve been prejudiced,&#8221; Marthe said. &#8220;They treat us like a second-class citizen.&#8221;</p>
<p>SEEK REPRIMANDS</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s Capt. Greg Richter, Wellington&rsquo;s senior law enforcement officer, countered: &#8220;The family got involved and tried to intervene and tried to resist the officers and that&rsquo;s why they were subsequently arrested. It had nothing to do with the color of their skin. It had to do with their actions.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The racist black african Haitains are notorius for their overt racism and disrespect for law and order.  They should never be permitted to come here.  And not one white middle class taxpayer should ever have to pay one red cent of taxes for their welfare.  That is a type of slavery against every working white person who is forced to pay for those racist people. Haiti needs massive birth control so their racist hordes will stay in their paradise that they own through extermination of the white and mulatto people who used to live there at the time of their revolution over 200 years ago.</p>

=====<br>
Yep,same old protests from black criminals and their family. It&rsquo;s amazing how blacks, no matter where they are from, are so similar. I don&rsquo;t know any people or have family members who have problems with the law. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unthinkable to most of us to be criminal but for blacks, that&rsquo;s normal, like it is nothing for every member of the family to have some problems with the law. They also have no shame whatsoever. </p>
<p>I hope they get their full punishment and deportation to their hell hole island which btw is black run. I&rsquo;m glad the mall and the police dept are not backing down, they should just ban any black teens due to overwhelming evidence that the majority of them are danger to human beings. Perhaps people&rsquo;s thinking has changed a bit after dealing with black criminals for decades. </p>

Your family has criminals. We have police. The two go together. Perhaps Haiti doesn&rsquo;t have laws, but we do, so if you&rsquo;re legal, get your act together or go to the slammer. If not, bon voyage!</p>

			<p>I find it ironic that a 20-year old business major can&rsquo;t follow the simple rules and regulations of a private establishment.  Being that this is a private establishment, they have more leeway to set these kinds of rules than governments.  Sometimes I wish they had much more leeway.</p>

			<p>If the Legers have been granted citizenship, they quite obviously are second class citizens, aside from their race.  Larceny, robbery, fraud, driving on a suspended license, resisting arrest, and buttcrack display are not exactly signs of civic virtue.  Send them back to Haiti, where their neighbors will more likely appreciate dorsal cleavage, along with the Legers other hobbies.<br>

			<p>The attitude by the &#8220;black&#8221; family is why blacks destroy communities.  They believe that rules are meant to be broken, and they&rsquo;re willing to fight anyone who tries to enforce them.  </p>
<p>As well, I always find it fascinating how some people can&rsquo;t see how they destroy themselves, and most blacks are a case study in that pathology. </p>
<p>Ah, those Haitians.  They know how a good and proper society runs.  Just look at that hell-hole of a country. </p>

			<p>Just more of blacks thinking they can just do whatever they want and feel like with no consequences or penalties. They have no shame, no sense of responsibility and no idea of proper civic behaviour. HE WAS BANNED FROM THE MALL so he had no business being there. That mall is private property. They didn&rsquo;t want to put up with his nonsense. No matter where they come from or go to blacks are always the same.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m certainly in agreement that these punks wear their pants too low (I was told this started in the blacks community because in prison they aren&rsquo;t given belts).</p>
<p>BUT, you don&rsquo;t need 20 cops and canine unit and a helicopter.  The cops in this country are out of control.  Blacks bear the largest brunt of this because crime is rampant in their communities.  I&rsquo;m sick of these bully cops and the tazers.</p>
<p>The only terrorist most Americans will ever see is a cop (not all cops) but I believe the majority are out of line.</p>

<p>I doubt they&rsquo;re even citizens at all.   I wish the article elaborated on that; but of course newspapers aren&rsquo;t going to tell you such things.  Might offend someone!</p>
<p>I say if they don&rsquo;t like the treatment they got from the police in Florida, let them go back home and see how they like the police in Haiti!  (I guarantee they won&rsquo;t be filing any brutality complaints there.)</p>

			<p>Frantz Ledger is a business major, eh?  And I bet he&rsquo;s an honors student too.  He&rsquo;ll go far if he shows up for job interviews with those saggy pants.  The cops did him a favor to point out how inappropriate he looked - something his parents should have done but left it to the taxpayers to take care of.</p>

			<p>Dear Mrs. Leger:  I&rsquo;ve seen London, I&rsquo;ve seen France, and I&rsquo;ve seen&hellip;..Frantz&rsquo; underpants??? Um, NOT!!</p>
<p>If I had been at that mall, I would have made a complaint and expected the rules to be followed.  Obviously you and your family feel the rules do not apply to you, but they do.  And, having 20 police officers to arrest six of your family was entirely correct.  That&rsquo;s a little over three officers per arrestee.  The canine unit and helicopter were probably necessary, too, as anyone who has seen a sawed off shotgun pulled out of a pair of &#8220;ghetto pants&#8221; can attest.</p>
<p>Sorry (NOT) about Frantz&rsquo;s arrest, but he sounds like he needs to go someplace where he can learn how to dress.</p>
<p>Very truly yours, Mall Shopper With Rights to Courtesy.</p>

			<p>The only point is that the mallis private property - and as such even in today&rsquo;s USA (which bears no relation to the nation of 1776)has the unreserved and absolute right to decide on its own code of dress and decorum.<br>
If you don&rsquo;t like it - don&rsquo;t use the mall!</p>

			<p>Just threaten them with voodoo dolls with pants down and pins stuck into their arses as they will probably take this more seriously than the law in USA. I don&rsquo;t blame the cops for turning up in force as otherwise they would have been stabbed or shot by a bunch of black africans who always seem ready to mobilise in large numbers at these events. The helicopter was probably there to film evidence (as we have oft seen on TV) and I doubt if it was fitted with stinger missiles or ready to drop anti-personnel mines. Is it true that haiti is a USA state? I havn&rsquo;t checked but if so, who on earth was responsible? If you want another one there is always zimbabwe or, any day now, kenya.</p>

			<p>Naaaah! Let them wear their clown suits. Let everyone see the as they really are. No sense trying to put lipstick on a pig. If they want to dress that way, LET THEM, and let everyone come to know who actually dresses in this manner. It makes it easier for ordinary people to identify them at a distance. Can&rsquo;t you think of circumstances where this might save lives and property?</p>

<p><br>
I think you have been taken in by the blatant misinformation in this article. </p>
<p>Although I agree with you about over zealous cops (I have been a victim of them myself) This time they were right.</p>
<p>This is not - as this artical suggests - about descending with full force on a young man with the wrong pants. It is about someone tresspassing on private property, and when challenged by the custodians of said property (not to mention he had a trespass notice against him which he willfully disregarded) he had the audacity to chellenge them and brought mob handed back up.</p>
<p>Just to put it in perspective for you. You have kicked this guy out of your house one time for showing up uninvited at a party you were hosting, he then comes back, enters  your home and refuses to leave. when you call police a half dozen of his relatives arrive and take over your house, they then challenge you and the police for the right to occupy your property.</p>
<p>You still think the maximum show of force is an over reaction? it&rsquo;s the same thing.<br>

			<p>If I had a young son and he was walking around dressed like that I would be ashamed. The mall banned him because of his attire? Good for them. That&rsquo;ll teach you. You go back on private property you are banned from? Arrest him officer. Teach him a lesson. Instead the family is fighting the cops. See the black  mentality? The apple never falls very far from the tree.</p>

			<p>I have noticed black males like their pants so loose they are almost always on the verge of falling off, while black females wear their clothing so tight they are almost on the verge of busting out of them. There seems to be a great tendancy towards exhibitionism among them.</p>
