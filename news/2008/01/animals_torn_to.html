						<p>The smiling children giggled as they patted the young goat on its head and tickled it behind the ears.</p>
<p>Some of the more boisterous ones tried to clamber onto the animal&rsquo;s back but were soon shaken off with a quick wiggle of its bottom.</p>
<p>It could have been a happy scene from a family zoo anywhere in the world but for what happened next.</p>
<p>A man hoisted up the goat and nonchalantly threw it over a wall into a pit full of hungry lions. The poor goat tried to run for its life, but it didn&rsquo;t stand a chance. The lions quickly surrounded it and started tearing at its flesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oohs&#8221; and &#8220;aahs&#8221; filled the air as the children watched the goat being ripped limb from limb. Some started to clap silently with a look of wonder in their eyes.</p>
<p>The scenes witnessed at Badaltearing Safari Park in China are rapidly becoming a normal day out for many Chinese families.</p>
<p>Baying crowds now gather in zoos across the country to watch animals being torn to pieces by lions and tigers.</p>
<p>Just an hour&rsquo;s drive from the main Olympic attractions in Beijing, Badaling is in many ways a typical Chinese zoo.</p>
<p>Next to the main slaughter arena is a restaurant where families can dine on braised dog while watching cows and goats being disembowelled by lions.</p>
<p>The zoo also encourages visitors to &#8220;fish&#8221; for lions using live chickens as bait. For just Â£2, giggling visitors tie terrified chickens onto bamboo rods and dangle them in front of the lions, just as a cat owner might tease their pet with a toy.</p>
<p>During one visit, a woman managed to taunt the big cats with a petrified chicken for five minutes before a lion managed to grab the bird in its jaws.</p>
<p>The crowd then applauded as the bird flapped its wings pathetically in a futile bid to escape. The lion eventually grew bored and crushed the terrified creature to death.</p>
<p>The tourists were then herded onto buses and driven through the lions&rsquo; compound to watch an equally cruel spectacle. The buses have specially designed chutes down which you can push live chickens and watch as they are torn to shreds.</p>
<p>Once again, children are encouraged to take part in the slaughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s almost a form of child abuse,&#8221; says Carol McKenna of the OneVoice animal welfare group. &#8220;The cruelty of Chinese zoos is disgusting, but think of the impact on the children watching it. What kind of future is there for China if its children think this kind of cruelty is normal?</p>
<p>&#8220;In China, if you love animals you want to kill yourself every day out of despair.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the cruelty of Badaling doesn&rsquo;t stop with animals apart. For those who can still stomach it, the zoo has numerous traumatised animals to gawp at.</p>
<p>A pair of endangered moon bears with rusting steel nose rings are chained up in cages so small that they cannot even turn around.</p>
<p>One has clearly gone mad and spends most of its time shaking its head and bashing into the walls of its prison.</p>
<p>There are numerous other creatures, including tigers, which also appear to have been driven insane by captivity. Predictably, they are kept in cramped, filthy conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zoos like this make me want to boycott everything Chinese,&#8221; says Emma Milne, star of the BBC&rsquo;s Vets In Practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d like to rip out everything in my house that&rsquo;s made in China. I have big problems with their culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you enjoy watching an animal die then that&rsquo;s a sad and disgusting reflection on you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised by their behaviour towards animals, as the value of human life is so low in China.&#8221;</p>
<p>East of Badaling lies the equally horrific Qingdao zoo. Here, visitors can take part in China&rsquo;s latest craze &mdash; tortoise baiting.</p>
<p>Simply put, Chinese families now gather in zoos to hurl coins at tortoises.</p>
<p>Legend has it that if you hit a tortoise on the head with a coin and make a wish, then your heart&rsquo;s desire will come true. It&rsquo;s the Chinese equivalent of a village wishing well.</p>
<p>To feed this craze, tortoises are kept in barbaric conditions inside small bare rooms.</p>
<p>When giggling tourists begin hurling coins at them, they desperately try to protect themselves by withdrawing into their shells.</p>
<p>But Chinese zoo keepers have discovered a way round this: they wrap elastic bands around the animals&rsquo; necks to stop them retracting their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tortoises aren&rsquo;t exactly fleet of foot and can&rsquo;t run away,&#8221; says Carol McKenna.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s monstrous that people hurl coins at the tortoises, but strapping their heads down with elastic bands so they can&rsquo;t hide is even more disgusting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because tortoises can&rsquo;t scream, people assume they don&rsquo;t suffer. But they do. I can&rsquo;t bear to think what it must be like to live in a tiny cell and have people hurl coins at you all day long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even worse is in store for the animals of Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain Village near Guilin in south-east China.</p>
<p>Here, live cows are fed to tigers to amuse cheering crowds. During a recent visit, I watched in horror as a young cow was stalked and caught. Its screams and cries filled the air as it struggled to escape.</p>
<p>A wild tiger would dispatch its prey within moments, but these beasts&rsquo; natural killing skills have been blunted by years of living in tiny cages.</p>
<p>The tiger tried to kill &mdash; tearing and biting at the cow&rsquo;s body in a pathetic looking frenzy &mdash; but it simply didn&rsquo;t know how.</p>
<p>Eventually, the keepers broke up the contest and slaughtered the cow themselves, much to the disappointment of the crowd.</p>
<p>Although the live killing exhibition was undoubtedly depressing, an equally disturbing sight lay around the corner: the &#8220;animal parade&#8221;.</p>
<p>Judging by the rest of the operation, the unseen training methods are unlikely to be humane, but what visitors view is bad enough.</p>
<p>Tigers, bears and monkeys perform in a degrading &#8220;entertainment&#8221;. Bears wear dresses, balance on balls and not only ride bicycles but mount horses too.</p>
<p>The showpiece is a bear riding a bike on a high wire above a parade of tigers, monkeys and trumpet-playing bears.</p>
<p>Astonishingly, the zoo also sells tiger meat and wine produced from big cats kept in battery-style cages.</p>
<p>Tiger meat is eaten widely in China and the wine, made from the crushed bones of the animals, is a popular drink.</p>
<p>Although it is illegal, the zoo is quite open about its activities. In fact, it boasts of having 140 dead tigers in freezers ready for the plate.</p>
<p>In the restaurant, visitors can dine on strips of stir-fried tiger with ginger and Chinese vegetables. Also on the menu are tiger soup and a spicy red curry made with tenderised strips of big cat.</p>
<p>And if all that isn&rsquo;t enough, you can dine on lion steaks, bear&rsquo;s paw, crocodile and several different species of snake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Discerning&#8221; visitors can wash it all down with a glass or two of vintage wine made from the bones of Siberian tigers.</p>
<p>The wine is made from the 1,300 or so tigers reared on the premises. The restaurant is a favourite with Chinese Communist Party officials who often pop down from Beijing for the weekend.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s zoos claim to be centres for education and conservation. Without them, they say, many species would become extinct.</p>
<p>This is clearly a fig leaf and some would call it a simple lie. Many are no better than &#8220;freak shows&#8221; from the middle ages and some are no different to the bloody tournaments of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s farcical to claim that these zoos are educational,&#8221; says Emma Milne.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you learn anything about wild animals by watching them pace up and down inside a cage? You could learn far more from a David Attenborough documentary.&#8221;</p>
<p>However pitiful the conditions might be in China&rsquo;s zoos, there are a few glimmers of hope.</p>
<p>It is now becoming fashionable to own pets in China. The hope is that a love for pets will translate into a desire to help animals in general. This does appear to be happening, albeit slowly.</p>
<p>One recent MORI opinion poll discovered that 90 per cent of Chinese people thought they had &#8220;a moral duty to minimise animal suffering&#8221;. Around 75 per cent felt that the law should be changed to minimise animal suffering as much as possible.</p>
<p>In 2004, Beijing proposed animal welfare legislation which stipulated that &#8220;no one should harass, mistreat or hurt animals&#8221;. It would also have banned animal fights and live feeding shows.</p>
<p>The laws would have been a huge step forward. But the proposals were scrapped following stiff opposition from vested interests and those who felt China had more pressing concerns.</p>
<p>And this is the central problem for animal welfare in China: its ruling elite is brutally repressive and cares little for animals.</p>
<p>Centuries of rule by tyrannical emperors and bloody dictators have all but eradicated the Buddhist and Confucian respect for life and nature.</p>
<p>As a result, welfare groups are urging people not to go to Chinese zoos if they should visit the Olympics, as virtually every single one inflicts terrible suffering on its animals</p>
<p>&#8220;They should tell the Chinese Embassy why they are refusing to visit these zoos,&rsquo; says Carol McKenna of OneVoice.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a nation is great enough to host the Olympic Games then it is great enough to be able to protect its animals.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Well well, the LEFTIS PC animal rights people are comming face to face with mulit-cultism, and making RACIST comments about our different cultured Chinese friends. Do these RACIST WHITE LIBERALS expect ALL OF HUMANITY to &#8220;Act like White people?&#8221; That would be RACIAL IMPERIALISM. </p>
<p>Welcome to your brave new world. America is a debtor nation, China holds the keys to our house.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never felt so much rage in reading anything in my life.  These disgusting punks deserve to be wiped off the map.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pay particular attention to the ones who are in this country from now on to see if they&rsquo;ve brought their evil practices with them, and, if so, act accordingly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to give a silent cheer everytime I read of a horrific catastrophe that occurs in that evil country full of disgusting maniacs.</p>
<p>I despise them and can only hope that the acceleration of their water and food scarcity shifts into an even higher gear than it is now.  I can&rsquo;t think of anybody more deserving.</p>

			<p>We in the western world, who continue to support third world immigration, are inviting nightmares that are unimaginable. Whether it is womens rights groups, ethnic lobby groups, cowardly Americna liberals, whether men or women, religious organizations,etc.   &mdash;  all who increase immigration of people with these barbaric practices are guilty of the continuing destruction of the Western World and its enlightened visions of &#8220;how things should be&#8221;. Indeed, my friends, we are slipping into barbarity, every single day. So called &#8220;progressives&#8221; and their neocon cohorts are to blame.</p>

			<p>Throughout history the Chinese have been reviled for their absolute lack of human compassion,ergo the &#8220;yellow menace&#8221; monicker they were labeled with in the more enlightened 19th and early 20th centuries. They are a brutal and stupid race who&rsquo;s only strength is their maniacal tendency to group together against all other peoples, and a single minded materialism that will have them willingly work themselves to death for money and posessions. They are, and have always been spiritually dead and emotionally retarded, capable of gross imitation, but in true cargo cult fashion, incapable of comprehending the substance and meaning of the civilization they steal from and imitate.<br/>
There are roughly 2 billion of these &#8220;people&#8221;.<br/>
Food is already growing scarce in their continent sized nation, and aborted human embryos are now considered a delicacy.<br/>
They already own more than 70% of this nation&rsquo;s natural resources as collateral on unpaid dollar debts.<br/>
What do you think the &#8220;Chinese solution&#8221; for us will be?<br/>

			<p>All cultures,  apparently, are not created equal.. I&rsquo;m not sure we should allow China buy our country outright, just yet. It&rsquo;s amazing how the popular academics have been teaching White children that their ancestors were essentially the Scourge of the Earth -  yet we are the ones that liberate the world from the depredations of these primitive sadists,  world wide,  We are the ones who outlawed slavery - killing each other in the process,  We are the ones that all the supposedly &#8220;more moral people&#8221;  flee to, for refuge and succor. It may be true that the teachings of Confucius and LaoTzu  would have evolved into a more nelightened and humane culture;  Communism eradicated the finer elements of the Chinese culture&hellip;. yet&hellip;. how could this be? Don&rsquo;t our own &#8220;intelligentsia&#8221; essentially praise Communism,  for  [it&rsquo;] &#8220;&hellip;great love of equality and common humanity?&#8221; Don&rsquo;t wealthy Chinese business men take delight in the rare delicacy of tying a living monkey down, gently carving off it&rsquo;s skull cap. then daintily feeding on it&rsquo;s brains..? All are not equal&hellip;</p>

			<p>While unnecessary cruelty to animals is surely disgusting, one has to wonder about what goes on in the minds of the Brits protesting China&rsquo;s zoos. In all honesty, there are horrendous crimes committed against THEIR OWN SPECIES, which they say nothing about. Sorry if I&rsquo;m more concerned with innocent White people who are raped, robbed and tortured than I am with animals on another continent.</p>

			<p>Well, all I can say is that the Chinese do seem hardy, and appear to be survivalists. Compared to their ruthless opportunism, we appear as namby pamby, lily-livered, groveling babies. Perhaps the Mongols were like this, when they took over the rest of Asia. Are we the Chinese Mandarins, enamored by their own idle hands. and long fingernails - and horrified by the barbarity of the blood-thirsty hordes?</p>

			<p>Disgusting to people with certain sensibilities, entertaining to others.  My kindly grandfather raised fighting cocks.  Elizabethan theaters alternated the plays of Shakespeare and Marlowe and Johnson with bear and bull baiting.  Plenty of people follow boxing and the more theatrical fighting sports, and even more watch brutish TV shows and movies.  I can&rsquo;t see slamming Chinese in particular for blood lust, when we have so much at home.  I do, however, feel sorry for the animals, suffering like that.  It&rsquo;s not as if they were car thieves or Congressmen.  </p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s anything in the whole of Chinese history that reveals them to be good &amp; decent people, I&rsquo;ve yet to hear about it. <br/>

			<p>That this was published by the Daily Mail is astounding.  Ever see anything like this written in the New World Order propagandist media?  Even say&hellip;National Geographic?  Other than gorgeous photographs of pandas and the altruistic, benevolent Chinese efforts to preserve them?

<p>Naturalist Charles Darwin purportedly rejected theism because he could not reconcile the biblical redemption of man with the immeasurable, meaningless suffering found in the animal world who due to lacking souls, were irredeemable (at least the prevailing scriptural wisdom).

Let them stay in Asia. Asians flock to white societies; you don&rsquo;t see whites wanting to go to Asian countries. Their values and modes of thinking are alien.

<p>We&rsquo;re a pansy society, basically. We&rsquo;re soft all around. We&rsquo;re unrealistic about Blacks and Mexicans in our treatment of them (thinking they&rsquo;re better than they are and ignoring evidence to the contrary) just like we&rsquo;re unrealistic about animals. </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t stand blood. Others do our killing for us. And as a result, we&rsquo;re detached from reality. We live in a world of theory, a theory that lends itself to saying Blacks are as smart as Whites, and all animals are to be treasured like in a Snow White Disney movie. </p>
<p>The Chinese may be the world&rsquo;s biggest copycats, but one thing I give them credit for is being realistic and down to earth.

<p>Just because that in nature carnivorous animals eat other animals doesn&rsquo;t mean that we should be watching it as entertainment. Do you suppose next we should show people going to the bathroom because it&rsquo;s &#8220;nature&rsquo;s call&#8221;? Or watch women going through labor pain for entertainment because it&rsquo;s another &#8220;part of nature&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout history the Chinese have been reviled for their absolute lack of human compassion,ergo the &ldquo;yellow menace&rdquo; monicker they were labeled with in the more enlightened 19th and early 20th centuries. They are a brutal and stupid race who&rsquo;s only strength is their maniacal tendency to group together against all other peoples, and a single minded materialism that will have them willingly work themselves to death for money and posessions. They are, and have always been spiritually dead and emotionally retarded, capable of gross imitation, but in true cargo cult fashion, incapable of comprehending the substance and meaning of the civilization they steal from and imitate.<br/>
There are roughly 2 billion of these &ldquo;people&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in a turkey abbattoir, I&rsquo;ve plucked the feathers from dead turkeys while standing knee deep in their feathers and surrounded by live turkeys,who, while awaiting their destiny, snoozed or sat idly by, preening or communicating in &#8216;Turkish&rsquo; with their mates. They did not suffer or anticipate their death. I could not have stepped inside if I thought that they did. As for other abbattoirs in the West, they are regularly inspected and have to comply to humane methods. We eat meat because it&rsquo;s natural and we do our best to treat them humanely. There will be headline news when an abbattoir is found not complying to humane standards and thanks to Multykulty we have to permit Halal butchery, where the animals throats are cut and they bleed to death. <br/>
I personally dislike the way fish die when caught in nets, its the equivalent of drowning cows, so I&rsquo;m often perplexed by those Vegetarians who proudly proclaim that they eat fish. A clear indication to me that they are motivated more by their dislike of &#8220;Big Red Meat&#8221; rather than any animal suffering.</p>
<p>When I lived in Hong Kong I witnessed the cruelty of Chinese treatment of animals. One day I saw a group of men laughing and gesticulating at something in the street. It was a rat, they had hog-tied it and thrown it into the traffic, For these men it was a source of entertainment to watch it&rsquo;s struggle to flee.  Don&rsquo;t ask me about their markets, or the bears, monkeys and dogs crammed into containers on display outside the front of restaurants.</p>
<p>Westerners used to be cruel, bear baiting, cock-fighting and the like - &#8216;sports&rsquo; that were purely for gambling/entertainment. (Unlike hunting and  line-fishing which is a remnant of our need to survive and which might at some time become necessary again). From science we&rsquo;ve learned that sentient beings feel pain, and we have developed a conscience (is it that Judeo/Christian thing again, &#8220;not a sparrow falls that my father in Heaven doesn&rsquo;t know&hellip;&#8221;. All I know is we are a darned lot nicer to animals that many many other groups of people around the world, yet we get all the brickbats.</p>
<p> What I like about Westerner&rsquo;s attitude towards these types of issues is that we are constantly examining our motives and actions to seek out improvements because, </p>

<p>That was then and this is now, but even so none of the things you mention compares with what the Chinese are doing.  In fact this article explains only a very small part of their disgusting cruelty.  They also beat little dogs and cats to death before preparing to eat them, while others in cages watch and wait their turns.    And some of these degenerates believe the animal will transfer certain qualities to the eater if the little animal is tortured to the point of screaming endlessly. </p>
<p>How a people treats its little animals tells volumes about them and what level of barbarity they&rsquo;ve degenerated to.</p>
<p>What goes around comes around.  Perhaps Chinese payback will be a severe outbreak of the avian-flu, wiping out a good portion of them, while making even more of them cripples and brain damaged robots.</p>

<p>Why not?  If blood lust is wrong, it&rsquo;s wrong.  You&rsquo;re claiming no voices in opposition has any legitimacy if even a lesser example to a smaller degree is evident somewhere on the same continent on which the complainer resides.  That&rsquo;s absurd.</p>
<p>But I doubt you will see anything on a scale described by this article in the US or anywhere else in the West.  No, not even bull fighting.  Too, many people here are trying to put a halt to ALL animal cruelty.  If we had here what China has there, I can guarantee you the Animal Liberation Front would be blowing up Zoos left and right, and average law abiding people would be marching in the streets in protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of people follow boxing and the more theatrical fighting sports, and even more watch brutish TV shows and movies. I can&rsquo;t see slamming Chinese in particular for blood lust, when we have so much at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>How anyone could give parity to the outrages in China with those kinds of above examples is truly amazing.</p>
<p>The Chinese are also killing off their female infants.  Does that in any way make you want to reconsider your pro-Chinese feelings?   </p>

<p>The &#8220;lovey-dovey&#8221; treatment of animals has nothing to do with opposition to the creation of ungodly atrocities described above.  Do you understand that the animal cruelty in China is done for the public&rsquo;s amusement?  Do you understand the difference?</p>
<p>Politically, you sound like a fellow white realist, so I&rsquo;m on your side in that regard, but you must try to understand that any parallels you draw from ancient times or from contact sports by humans is NOT the same as being gleeful and rejoicing in the destruction of a helpless creature that relies on man for protection.</p>
<p>The article states cows are thrown to the lions to be mauled as they scream in wretched agony, as they are torn apart but not killed, and for what purpose?  For public amusement!</p>

			<p>There are many aspects of Asian/Chinese culture that I have witnessed, and find deplorable: </p>
<p>Their treatment of other ethnic groups; in Malaysia,Indonesia, Singapore, and Taiwan they often treat their servants like slaves.</p>
<p>Their treatment of women. I have no respect for men who cheat on their wives. For the chinese, it&rsquo;s a macho thing. The wives told me &#8220;as long as he gives me money for shopping, I don&rsquo;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suspect that animal cruelty is so prevalent in Asian societies because it&rsquo;s the only way for the people to take out their own frustrations at having their whole lives micro-managed by their parents.  </p>
<p>I think there are several things that will hinder China from achieving global dominance:</p>
<p>1) preference for male children= not enough females = decreasing birthrates. I think the Chinese will be beyond the &#8220;point of no return&#8221; within a generation.</p>
<p>2) AIDS.  Prostitutioin being so commonplace in Chinese society, China is on the verge of an AIDS epidemic (if it hasn&rsquo;t already begun)</p>
<p>3a) Lack of industrial regulations. There have been lots of industrial accidents (mining, usually) in addition to the recent toy recalls. This corrupt attitude of &#8220;cutting corners&#8221; will eventually backfire on them. They already have a dozen nuclear reactors online, and they&rsquo;re building more.</p>
<p>3b) Ecological deterioration. Specifically desertification: China is getting drier as water resources are diverted from farmlands to growing urban centers. </p>

We just take the studio&rsquo;s word for it that no humans were eviscerated in the making of the film, and then revel in the slaughter.  Many Chinese apparently enjoy killing every bit as much as many Americans do, they are simply less sophisticated about it.  <br/>
And the fact that blood sports have largely been outlawed in the West in the last hundred years does not make Whites better that Chinese.  Would anyone argue that we are a much better people than our great grandparents?  That the Americans of the Revolutionary generation were no better than modern Chinese?  <br/>
There is no need for WN to despise the Chinese, or to imagine that they have a unique taste for cruelty.  The mere fact that they are not us, is reason enough to oppose  their influence and colonization.<br/>

			<p>People keep referring to the Chinese as being souless, robotic, sub-human, less cultured, etc&hellip; I remind you that they are not committing race suicide and will crush anyone or any group who tries what blacks/hispanics do here in the states. Don&rsquo;t buy into liberal brainwashing that fools people into caring and sacrificing for anything else that creeps crawls walks runs and ignore your own people and family. Animals are animals, try to reform cruelty to animals but don&rsquo;t try to make me look down on robust aggressive determined group of one race one people who are looking out for their own interest. We should be so lucky.</p>

			<p><i>When I lived in Hong Kong I witnessed the cruelty of Chinese treatment of animals. &hellip;&hellip;Don&rsquo;t ask me about their markets, or the bears, monkeys and dogs crammed into containers on display outside the front of restaurants.</i></p>
<p>That is absolute hogwash. I&rsquo;ve visited Hong Kong several times, and dog-eating, cat-eating is outlawed. Most Hong Kongers, due to British influence, will recoil from eating dog as much as the average Westerner. In fact most Asians in the West, and 100percent of those raised in the West, eschew eating dogs and cats. Anyone who has visited the Hong Kong knows that there were markets with only live poultry up until the 1998 bird flu outbreak. Since then the live markets have been completely shut down.</p>
<p>As for wanton cruelty to animals, pursuing a fox for an hour or so, until it tires and then setting a pack of dogs on it to tear it to pieces is akin to what is described in the article above. This was legal in Britain up until only a few years ago (in fact our very own Jacqueline Kennedy took part in such a hunt).</p>
<p>As for atavistic blood lust, nothing comes close to the very public lynching scenes of last century. The victims (whites as well as blacks) were subject to the most horrible of tortures, burnt alive, skinned, emasculated in front of baying crowds of <i>ordinary</i> men, women and children. Fingers and toes would be cut off and distributed to the crowd as souvenirs. The enjoyment of seeing a human being, or animal in pain is something that, is not something that is exclusive to non-whites.  In early 19th Century Britain, hanging days drew huge enthusiastic crowds - hence the term &#8216;gala.&rsquo; We are no different genetically from our ancestors who participated in these events - just more aware.</p>

<p>Westerners find nothing wrong with inserting a hook into the back of a fish, and letting it struggle for hours on end in the water(&#8216;live&rsquo; baiting) in an attempt to catch a bigger fish (the idea is that a struggling weak or dying fish will be attractive and easy prey for any predators).</p>
<p>Historically the race that has treated animals the best, are of course the Indians - most of whom are vegetarian. The Japanese are also by-and-large compassionate to animals (they don&rsquo;t eat dog - only whales - but then so do Norwegians, Icelanders, and Pharoah Islanders). Buddhist Tibetans also have a great reverence for all forms of life. Buddhist Chinese forgo meat and instead enjoy faux meat, chicken and lamb made from tofu.</p>
<p>Contrast this to the West, where vegetarianism is but a very recent phenomenon. Animal cruelty is a problem in China, but as the article above mentions, most Chinese abhor it and want to see animal protection laws put in place. China is about where America and Europe were about 100 to 150 years ago with respect to animal welfare. So it can hardly be about genes.<br/>

			<p>The axiom, life is cheap in China, is largely due to the Chinese overpopulation problem. So if Chinese are too indifferent to respect human life (caused by their self-inflicted overbreeding) you would hardly expect such people to respect animal lives.</p>
<p>It might be noted that displaying abnormal cruelty generally is accompanied by cruel and abusive treatment of people. Witness the many sociopathic rapists and killers who started out in childhood, torturing helpless small animals, then graduating to inflicting the same cruel treatment to fellow humans as adults. A trait confirmed by many psychiatrists and psychologists. Thus it&rsquo;s hardly surprising Chinese being well known for their disdain of human life.</p>
<p>As to cruel and abusive treatment of animals, I reject the biblical absurdity that mankind has the right to do what we please with animals. In that respect I side with the animal rights groups. To me, it&rsquo;s an issue of morality. Sure, animals are part of our food chain. But there IS a difference between hateful cruel treatment of animals versus using them as food.</p>

<p>1) live food for carnivores shall be killed in an ethical and<br/>

<p>2) such food shall be kept refrigerated and free from all con-<br/>

   furthermore</p>
<p>4) such food shall be cut in such a way as to in no wise resem-<br/>

<p>These procedures are followed by accredited zoological gardens throughout the world. China is lagging behind, but with sufficient encouragement, I am sure that they will adopt these procedures.</p>

<p>Thankyou for confirming my own belief that it is us Westerners whose influence upon others has been responsible for reducing much of the animal cruelty throughout the world. No thanks for accusing me of writing &#8216;hogwash&rsquo;, do you think I&rsquo;m a liar? If you read my post you will see that I said &#8216;When I lived in Hong Kong&rsquo;. It was during the 1970&rsquo;s that I lived there (as opposed to a few visits where one tends not to walk the back streets, eat at local restaurants and shop in &#8216;local&rsquo; shops and talk with locals, employees etc about their attitudes). But in any case I&rsquo;m pleased to read your account that the Chinese have improved with regard their treatment of animals, especially, as you say, &#8216;due to British influence&rsquo; and again as you say,&rsquo;due to the 98 birdflu outbreak&rsquo; which worryingly indicates $$$ and self preservation rather than altruism; the above article doesn&rsquo;t demonstrate much animal love in today&rsquo;s China either, or is that hogwash too?</p>
<p>.&gt;&gt;&gt;As for wanton cruelty to animals, pursuing a fox for an hour or so, until it tires and then setting a pack of dogs on it to tear it to pieces is akin to what is described in the article above<br/>
You do know that the fox is a hunter? hunting and being hunted is what it does, and please you must surely know that the fox is dead long before it&rsquo;s torn to pieces; one flick and its neck is broken. <br/>
It seems to me that foxes are in hog-heaven when they come upon a family of ducks; one wouldn&rsquo;t mind if they just took what they needed to eat but that is not the case; I can assure you that nothing beats getting up in the morning and finding your pets chicks, the duckpond and back yard filled with blood, heads, wings, lambs stumbling about with no feet,and 20 or thirty dead and dying ducks and chickens. I don&rsquo;t like foxes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you are a Westerner or not, but if you are, do you ever ask yourself why you are so very keen to heap praise upon and excuse the behaviour of non-Westerners but have this self-loathing of your own kind? If you are not Western then I guess you are at least sticking up for your own. </p>

<p>There is a difference between this and what is mentioned in the article above. Most of the spectators, are simply indulging in a little Romanesque blood lust - which is, unfortunately, not a psychiatric abnormality. Most of the spectators at public executions not too long ago enjoyed the event - but most would not be considered psychopaths or sadists. Psychopathic personality is another sort of thing altogether.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m into WHITE rights. I don&rsquo;t care too much for animal rights. The fact is we abuse millions of pigs, a creature more intelligent, with at least as high a level of sentience as dogs, every single day in a manner that differs little from the way Chinese exploit bears for their bile. But I still enjoy my bacon - and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>My son is most fascinated by those nature documentaries where a lion or tiger brings down and antelope. I don&rsquo;t thing that this is psychologically abnormal - in fact it is quite healthy and natural. But when one becomes an adult, civilized people will supress their worst instincts - but they are always there. </p>
<p>Most people would actually be fascinated by the spectacle of a public execution (our very recent ancestors certainly were). Some who say they wouldn&rsquo;t are behaving in exactly the same way as those who say they don&rsquo;t see race - they are lying about their true feelings in order to maintain social respectability.</p>
<p>Being a meat-lover, I just don&rsquo;t care too much about how Chinese treat animals. The amount of animal suffering involved in getting that pork steak or chicken breast to my plate is enormous. But this is not going to stop me from eating meat.</p>
<p>If we start beating up on the Chinese, the Hindus can then beat up on us. I don&rsquo;t care what the Chinese do in their OWN country -  whether it is to each other or to animals. I only care that they should NOT be in MY country.</p>

<p>I notice that the above poster and others seem to believe they must defend the practice of animal cruelty because they eat meat.  It seems the more bravado they display the guiltier they feel for doing what they do.</p>
<p>For the most part, there is little suffering in processing animals in the US, but, whatever,  in no way can it be considered comparable to what goes on in China and the rest of the second and third world.</p>
<p>Only in the Halal slaughter houses in America can it be said that animals suffer, because their throats are cut and they&rsquo;re left to bleed to death, staggering around in pain until they drop from loss of blood.  That&rsquo;s just a small portion over all, and there&rsquo;s nothing the US can do to stop it.</p>
<p>But in the vast majority of other American slaughter houses a quick shot to the head and a steer is out of it entirely, so the majority of animals are dispatched quickly.  </p>

			<p>Poster at 9:57PM, I worked in a pork processing plant. The animals had to be shocked before having their throats slit. It is the law. Furthermore, did you not read that part of the article that said the lions and tigers who were not trained in the wild did not have the skill to dispatch their prey as efficiently as those in the wild and great suffering was caused to the prey as well as, to some extent, the untrained (by its mother) lion or tiger. What makes you infer that most people would enjoy public executions, and other such things? Hundreds of thousands of people have tried to stop bullfighting in Spain for years now. </p>

			<p>All this animal rights stuff is a pure waste of time. There is no less animal suffering now than when bear baiting was legal in the UK. We need to harden up. A goat getting ripped to shreds by a pack of lions is the way things happen in nature. Its also a pretty quick death. </p>
<p>Our ancestors such as Henry VIII and Elizabeth I enjoyed bear baiting - something that would be decried in terms of contemporary morality, as absolutely barbaric. But they were great nationalist leaders that would leave our current crop of &#8216;leaders&rsquo; in the dust for patriotism</p>

<p>The poster was trying to explain that not all Chinese are cruel to animals and many are trying to change cruel practices just as here in the West. </p>
<p>Many other posters are saying that it is cruel to torture animals for food or for for entertainment but it isn&rsquo;t just the Chinese. Many Spanish have been trying to stop bull fighting but it is still going on.</p>
<p>Another point many posters are trying to point out is that we need to be a little tougher and stop wasting our time obsessing about &#8216;rights&rsquo;. We have enough &#8216;rights&rsquo; for every druggie out there. We need to figure out how to run our country in a fair and tough minded way and getting bogged down in animal rights is where the liberal social engineers have routed our minds instead of paying attention to the crisis that is happening in our country. </p>
<p>Nobody is advocating animal cruelty but it doesn&rsquo;t reflect that poorly on the Chinese as a people if you compare what kinds of mass hypnosis and racial suicide we appear to be allowing to our own kind and culture.<br/>

As measured by Western Civilization (still the gold standard in the ethical treatment of humans and animals), China is found to be sorely lacking. While deplorable, I do not find their treatment of animals surprising. This is after all, a culture that at one time instituted foot binding to make their women look sexier.</p>

<p>Foot binding was a practice lasting around one-thousand years. The men required the mother or grandmother to cripple daughters at the early age of three or younger. This practice is just not comparable to woman who sought to follow the fashion of the day.</p>

<p>Wow. I think I need to go back to school. I thought for sure the animals in the photograph were lions. I guess I&rsquo;m showing my ignorance but I thought I observed male and female lions in the photograph. I must be mistaken in my understanding that it is usually a small group of female lions (tigers?) that hunt prey. </p>
<p>Speaking of which, I would describe the photograph in the article as depicting a herd of lions (tigers?). I thought most lions lived in a pride. It is also my understanding that tigers (lions?) are solitary creatures. </p>
<p>For the life of me, I never realized that chickens and goats were natural prey animals for lions (tigers?). I just did not know that there are people whose job is to feed lions (tigers?) in the wild. Do they stand in trees or something when they chunk the live chickens or goats at the tigers (lions?). Is that really how tigers (lions?) learn to hunt? <br/>

			<p>It seems that some of our white European brethren are still not that much more civilized than the Asiatics. Torturing cattle by setting them aflame, throwing darts at them, spearing them for several hours and then cutting their testicles off while they are still alive, tossing live goats off church bell-towers and getting young girls to hack away at poultry with blunt edged rusty swords, the baiting of donkeys - all as part of some religious or ancient cultural ritual seems to be much on a par with what is described in the article above. And the perpetrators don&rsquo;t have the excuse of poverty and ignorance to excuse their appalling actions.</p>

<p>You really think using a subset of the &ldquo;white&rdquo; European is a valid comparison to the nature of the Oriental? I&rsquo;m sorry but I&rsquo;m not buying it.

<p>What is really mind-boggling to me is what several Asian countries have done in the 21st century. They have reduced their wildlife down to the level of rodent. I pray to God this is not the future for the rest of the animals on this planet. <br/>

<p>That is an utter distoration of the facts. These practices are perpetrated by indigenous <i>white</i> Spaniards themselves. They have local cultural and religious significance - going back hundreds of years. You can&rsquo;t pin the blame for these abhorrent practices on non-whites.</p>
<p><i>What is really mind-boggling to me is what several Asian countries have done in the 21st century. They have reduced their wildlife down to the level of rodent. I pray to God this is not the future for the rest of the animals on this planet.</i> </p>
<p>Europe use to abound with bears, wolves, aurochs, European Bison and other wildlife. Where are they now? The North Atlantic gray whale was hunted to extinction by Europeans in the 1700s. Who almost drove the North American bison to extinction in the 19th Century?</p>
<p>As a factual matter, whites have been responsible for more animal extinctions than any other race. Even with respect to the whales, it was whites who hunted them to the brink of extinction in the first place - and then hypocritically turned around and anointed themselves as the whale&rsquo;s protectors.</p>
<p>Eastern religions have always had a higher reverence for nature and animal life than Christianity. Many Asian diets are vegetarian based, or fish based. Far more animals have to suffer and die to meet the dietary needs of one Westerner than one Oriental. </p>
<p>Having said that, any animal abuser, of whatever race, deserves to be treated in exactly the same way he treated his victim. I would be very happy to see the Chinaman of the article be the very next item on the lion&rsquo;s menu. </p>
<p>However pontificating about animal-rights makes us look like hypocrites; worst of all it diverts our attention from preventing the worst possible environmental catastrophe of all - the extinction of European mankind. </p>

Excellent point!   I&rsquo;m disgusted too. But there is another  side to this, and  you raise a valid issue.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t like to acknowledge it, or even think of it, the fact is that a few centuries ago you could have seen bear-baiting, dogs pitted against bulls, etc in any Western country. Even public human executions were no big deal.  Burning, hanging, drawing and quartering   &mdash;   they were considered entertinment for the masses, in a time before  television and movies.   Bull fights, dog fights, etc are still common practices  in some countries today.   Even into the 1800&rsquo;s, eye-gouging was a popular sport in the US, among Mississippi boatman and frontiersmen.</p>
<p>Whites then were tough and hardy. They had to be because life itself was tough and hard.   Whites didn&rsquo;t shrink from blood, and life was cheap.  Wars were constant, hardship and poverty were everywhere, and only the strong survived. This all was occurring at a time when the white countries were powerful, feared, and their empires expanding. Other societies were unable resist them. (Any accident?)</p>
<p>As we grew richer and softer, we have grown squeamish.  The Chinese are not squeamish.  They don&rsquo;t mind blood.  They don&rsquo;t worry about cruelty. They don&rsquo;t fret about human rights, much less animal rights.    If it came to any mortal contest between nations, which would prevail   &mdash;   the ruthless or the squeamish?   Well, just look at the barbaric, merciless Mongols, as you said.   I don&rsquo;t like the answer.<br/>

<p><i>We&rsquo;re a pansy society, basically. We&rsquo;re soft all around.  We&rsquo;re unrealistic about Blacks and Mexicans in our treatment of them (thinking they&rsquo;re better than they are and ignoring evidence to the contrary),  just like we&rsquo;re unrealistic about animals.  We can&rsquo;t stand blood. Others do our killing for us ..as a result, we&rsquo;re detached from reality. <br/>

<p>You post is brutally realistic, and I hate to agree with you.  But I have to! What you say is absolutely true.  I wish it were otherwise, but it can&rsquo;t be denied. Life is cruel, and life is bloody. And in this world the most ruthless survive while the weak perish.</p>
<p>We are so &#8220;civilized&#8221; that we have become detached from many of the most basic, harsher, realities of life   &mdash;    to the extent that city people and children today think meat grows in a plastic package on the grocery shelf.   In my grandmother&rsquo;s time, people had to kill their own chickens and gut their own fish.  They knew what life and death were about.  They understood that life for one creature meant death for another.  What was good for you was not going to be good for the pig. Now, all that unpleasantness  is done for us by other hands,  neatly out of sight, and we don&rsquo;t have to deal with it. Today&rsquo;s generation can be obsessed with doing good for everything and everyone, everywhere, without worrying about where dinner came from.   Yes, life is pleasanter and easier   &mdash;   but in the long run is this really a gain or not?  Has it made us weaker?<br/>

Sorry to disagree, VD.  With much respect to you, I personally think you had it right the first time. </p>
<p>Otherwise,  how would you explain the many thousands of victims  (human) who were burned at the stake, and in other ways horribly tortured,  all in the name of religion and for the greater glory of God?   Don&rsquo;t you suppose they screamed too?</p>

<p>Great point. Reminds me of a documentary on the Hoover dam. A worker had just been killed and the foreman was informed. The foreman didn&rsquo;t want to disrupt the flow of work and simply said &#8220;don&rsquo;t worry about him - he&rsquo;s alright where he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our wealth has made us soft. The Chinese are now where whites were 50 to 100 years ago. They have public executions, we did up until 1938. We used to think nothing about publicly celebrating the well deserved hanging of rapists and murderers, with or without due process, and putting the scene on postcards. </p>
<p>I wonder about some of the whites here who weep over poultry and cattle. Wake up - your ancestors would most likely have attended and enjoyed, or at least been indifferent, to a show such as the one described in the article - and they were ten times better men than you. Think instead about what <i>we</i> need to do to survive as a <i>race.</i></p>

			<p>This article inspires so many posts because it indirectly addresses the major flaw in White people. That flaw I label, &#8216;White Weakness&rsquo;. </p>
<p>White Weakness in a nutshell is the boundless ability to see the world as one wishes it to be and not as it really is. </p>
<p>In terms of invention and creativity, this design-oriented idealist thinking creates patents and technological revolutions (we see objects as we would like them to be, we shape according to what we envision). </p>
<p>In terms of human beings, this idealism creates affirmative action, no border protection from Mexico, a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, and a plethora of other &#8216;all peoples are all the same&rsquo; type laws and regulations (we see non-white people as we wish they would be-all nice and wonderful and law abiding and respectful just like any other white person).</p>
<p>And finally, the topic this Chinese zoo article addresses, in terms of animals, this White Weakness creates a Disneyed up warm and fuzzy wuzzy Muppet Babies outlook on all things four-legged and furry. </p>
<p>White Weakness would have us think that all animals are to be cherished and loved and protected. That the steak we had for dinner, the pork we had for lunch yesterday, those meats somehow (because of some reason far off in the distance we&rsquo;re successfully getting ourselves to forget) were not from a living animal that was killed or anything like that. No (Maybe the animal died a natural death and we just got lucky and walked by and picked it up and that&rsquo;s how come I have my medium rare steak with mashed potatoes for dinner now).</p>
<p>Basically, Asians aren&rsquo;t afflicted with White Weakness. America is, big time (hence the hippies anthropomorphizing trees and butterflies, and the existence of such institutions like the SPCA and PETA and ALF)</p>
<p>Why do we suffer from White Weakness and constantly see the world as we wish it would be instead of as it really is? </p>

			<p>Reading the comments about how tough white people used to be makes me think of stories grandparents used to tell. &ldquo;In my day, we had to walk five miles one way to school with ten feet of snow on the ground in a blizzard in our bare feet.&rdquo; We have the modern world in large part because those tough white people were constantly trying to make life a little easier. While I admire the pioneers who had the fortitude to travel West in covered wagons, averaging twenty miles a day if they were lucky, I like being able to travel twenty miles in about twenty minutes in my car.</p>
<p>In the past, people had the mercy of dying at a relatively young age. If you think growing old is going to be a walk in the park, you are kidding yourself or are one of the few lucky ones. And life will not be so easy for everyone else. Try shouldering the responsibility of taking care of elderly parents while raising your own children, all under the shadow of wondering when your job is going to disappear or be outsourced. </p>
<p>All this talk about how terrible white people were to animals in the past makes me think of when I learned that Indians (Asians) used every part of the buffalo and were proclaimed to be great conservationists. It was only years later that I learned they used to stamped herds of buffalo off cliffs. </p>
<p>Being a consumer of animal products, I have no problem with the killing, grilling, and eating of animals. It is all about the behavior I have seen Asians exhibit during the preparation on animals. The psychotic joy they express while torturing animals is what repulses me. <br/>

<p>I have also discovered that articles on white slavery find little interest here, even though that ongoing holocaust has its share of stomach churning brutality, torture, and horrific killings.  I have read accounts of white children filmed while being raped, girls skinned alive or beheaded in the streets of the middle east for refusing their captors.</p>

I remember touring the Hoover Dam. Crews worked on its construction round the clock, day and night  &mdash;   even through the blazing summer (no air conditioning back then).  Anyone who&rsquo;s been there in summer knows how scorching hot it can get, it&rsquo;s like an oven!  There were 112 lives lost during construction. Work went right on, non-stop.</p>
<p>It would have been the same story during the building of the Transcontinental Railroad, the Erie Canal, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>Some White people here on Amren are appalled when they read about Chinese people showing &#8216;psychotic joy&rsquo; in watching animals get killed and eaten. </p>

<p><i>Many Chinese apparently enjoy killing every bit as much as many Americans do, they are simply less sophisticated about it. And the fact that blood sports have largely been outlawed in the West in the last hundred years does not make Whites better that Chinese. </i></p>

I do not invariably agree with Schoolteacher, but this time I certainly do!<br/>
In all of the above he has stated my own opinions perfectly.  Reading the mistaken, unjustified  condemnation that he has been getting here, I am concerned that after expressing my own view (that we occidentals have grown soft and lost touch with nature), people will assume that I am in favor killing for the sport of it.   Absolutely not!   Or they will assume that I am somehow pro-Chinese and anti-American.  Then I will start getting mysterious e-mails (again) accusing me of being a pro-Chinese agent, having a Chinese wife,  and all sorts of other  nonsense. None of which is remotely correct.</p>
<p>In lamenting that we have gone soft, I am not advocating blood sports, nor defending the Chinese enjoyment of them, which I personally find very repulsive.   Actually, I have ambivalent feelings about this whole subject.  For example, while I don&rsquo;t personally care for hunting, I am not opposed to hunting that&rsquo;s done by others and I refuse to say anything against it.  Why?  Because, as Arcadian said, we  may need it someday.  And it&rsquo;s good for our people to remain in touch with the earthy facts about where food comes from, and not become too squeamish.  We are, after all, carnivores who survived by eating other animals, and meat is what fed our ancestors for countless generations. That being said, I do not in any way endorse the killing of other creatures for the &#8220;fun&#8221; of watching their suffering.  And I am as much opposed to these Chinese spectacles as I am to Spanish bullfights.  Killing for food and killing for fun are two entirely different things.</p>

Perhaps this has a lot to do with the influence of Disney and comics. And of Televisionprograms like Sesame Street that feature friendly dinosaurs and playful crocodiles - a nice, warm, cuddly world where everyone is friendly and loving.  An utterly false and misleading  world that doesn&rsquo;t prepare our children for reality.</p>
<p>There was a case several years ago  at the Bronx Zoo where a little boy  somehow climbed into the polar bear cage. He was of course immediately killed and half eaten. Well, what else? They&rsquo;re carnivores!  That&rsquo;s what meat-eaters do. They were behaving naturally  for bears. They probably thought he was their lunch.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that he thought they were great big cuddly teddy bears like the ones he had seen on TV and in comics, and he wanted to play with them.  </p>
<p>No, polar bears are NOT teddy bears!   And they are not friendly and cuddly.  Polar bears are not for playing with.  They are dangerous and vicious animals that would EAT you!   But our modern children are shielded in a make-believe, story-book world where everybody is kind and friendly and nobody ever gets hurt.  That&rsquo;s not reality.   And it cost him his life.</p>
