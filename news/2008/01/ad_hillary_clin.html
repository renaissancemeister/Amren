						<p>The radio ad aired by one of Obama&rsquo;s labor allies re-injects ethnicity into the Democratic primary contest in sharp terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hillary Clinton does not respect our people,&#8221; the ad says in Spanish {snip} referring to the lawsuit that failed today to shut down special caucus sites on Las Vegas&rsquo; strip. &#8220;Hillary Clinton is shameless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sen. Obama is defending our right to vote. Sen. Obama wants our votes. He respects our votes, our community, and our people. Sen. Obama&rsquo;s campaign slogan is &lsquo;Si Se Puede.&rsquo; Vote for a president who respects us, and who respects our right to vote,&#8221; the ad says, according to a transcript provided by the Clinton campaign and confirmed in part by a union official.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s pathetic and it&rsquo;s sad and it&rsquo;s unfortunate that they have to stoop so low,&#8221; said Dolores Huerta, a longtime Hispanic labor leader who supports Clinton. She said she had never met Obama in her years of working on Hispanic causes, and suggested the ad was prompted by his lack of Hispanic support.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The political director for the textile and hotel workers&rsquo; union UNITE-HERE, Tom Snyder, confirmed a portion of the transcript, and defended the decision to run it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re doing this because forces allied with her campaign are trying to keep our members out of voting through this lawsuit, which neither Senator Clinton nor former President Clinton have denounced,&#8221; he said.</p>

															<h2>Judge Dismisses Nevada Caucus Challenge</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Ken Ritter, AP, January 17, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>A union with ties to Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton failed in court Thursday to prevent casino workers from caucusing at special precincts on the Las Vegas strip.</p>
<p>The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge James Mahan was presumed to be a boost for Clinton rival Barack Obama in the Democratic presidential caucuses Saturday because he has been endorsed by the union representing many of the shift workers who will be able to use the precincts.</p>
<p>&#8220;State Democrats have a First Amendment right to association, to assemble and to set their own rules,&#8221; Mahan said.</p>
<p>Nevada&rsquo;s Democratic Party approved creation of the precincts to make it easier for housekeepers, waitresses and bellhops to caucus during the day near work rather than have to do so in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The state teachers union, which has ties to Clinton, brought the suit against the special precincts shortly after local 226 of the Culinary Workers Union endorsed Obama for the Democratic nomination. The union is the largest in Nevada, with 60,000 members. The Clinton campaign said it was not involved in the suit.</p>
<p>The suit contended party rules allowing the precincts gave too much power to the casino workers and violated federal equal protection guarantees.</p>
<p>But the judge said, &#8220;We aren&rsquo;t voting here, we&rsquo;re caucusing. That&rsquo;s something that parties decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Campaigning in San Francisco, Obama welcomed the judge&rsquo;s decision, saying, &#8220;Any alternation would have disenfranchised maids, dishwashers, bellhops, people who work on the strip. Some of the people who set up the rules apparently didn&rsquo;t think that we would be as competitive as we were and tried to change at the last minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a statement, the Clinton campaign pointed out that other voters won&rsquo;t receive the same advantages as the bellhops and waitresses along the strip.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents of the strip precincts said they could be more valuable in the delegate count than some sparsely populated counties, giving them too much clout. The Culinary Union said the suit was an attempt to disenfranchise its members. &#8220;Backers of Hillary Clinton are suing in court to take away our right to vote in the caucuses,&#8221; a union flier said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama has also collected the endorsement of the Nevada chapter of the Service Employees International Union. The close nature of the contest and the logistics of caucuses created an intense struggle for labor&rsquo;s support, given its ability to organize and mobilize.</p>

The only glimmer of hope I see for white Americans is that the left, Democrats, liberals, &#8216;progressive&rsquo;, etc are too diverse as individual groups to every create anything resembling self-sustained and lasting unity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that they can form temporary coalitions regarding overlapping issues but diversity is not a strength. Diversity is ticking time bomb, it&rsquo;s what rips groups apart and leads to schisms.</p>
<p>Each group believes their issue should come first. Women, blacks, hispanics, homosexuals, muslims, etc. Each one will put up with the other for awhile but as the pie is being sliced, they&rsquo;ll be cutting each other to shreds.</p>
<p>The more diverse they become the better for us.</p>
<p>Here in Buffalo, blacks are charging Hispanics with racism for siding with Whites. This is no unity or love here:</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t argue with that; in fact, that is almost a compliment, considering it is directed at the Red queen of the village. You know, the independent woman, who is not: &ldquo;some little woman, standing by my man, like Tammy Wynette.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Indeed, at worst the Obama campaign can be accused of gross understatement and nothing more!<br>

			<p>Race will destroy the democratic party. Many blacks.  And I do mean, MANY blacks are ready to permanently abandon the dems if Obama does not win the nomination.</p>
<p>And the dems seem ready to let them go.  They assume that they can replace blacks with hispanics, for purposes of vote exploitation.  What they fail to understand is that hispanics are FAR more interested in seizing the power that the democratic party movers and shakers enjoy than blacks ever were.  And that&rsquo;s what this election is about.  Power.</p>
<p>In years past, blacks have been content to, essentially, sell their votes to the dems in exchange for entitlements.  No more.  They now see it as a very real possibility that they could seize control of this country in a manner similar to how blacks have seized control of Zimbabwe and South Africa (with similar results  being probable, I might add).  This is a new and dangerous wrinkle in the dems history of blaxploitation.  One that they are unlikely to allow to manifest.  Instead, they will end their unholy alliance with blacks and their causes (such that they are).</p>
<p>But they assume they can simply replace blacks with hispanics.  NOT SO.  Hispanics are interested in seizing power immediately.  That&rsquo;s what they are here in the US FOR.  To that purpose, they immediately set out undermining the democratic power base, hoping to destroy it and take over.</p>
<p>The dems can&rsquo;t win the next election.  Or rather, any way that leads to their victory is meaningless because the people behind the scenes will have their power wrested from them.  Defeat to the republicans is far preferable.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will result in a realignment of the democratic agenda to the purpose of courting the white vote.  Only good can come from that.  Both directly and indirectly (by forcing the republicans to compete to keep whites happy).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the age of the liberal and his penchant for race baiting politics, is coming to an end.</p>

			<p>Just a few weeks ago I thought that the Dems had a 99% chance of winning in November.Now because of the intense emotional fighting between Hillary, Obama, and their supporters the Democrats might not only lose in November, the party might be fragmenting beyond repair. Wow! It&rsquo;s things like this that makes life interesting!</p>
<p>I never thought that blacks and Hispanics would make a good coalition. Blacks resent Hispanics for taking away low skilled jobs and working for cheap. Hispanics generally don&rsquo;t like blacks..they see the negative qualities but haven&rsquo;t been here long enough to feel any false guilt or political correctness like so many whites do.  </p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s entire campaign is centered around slogans. There is absolutely no substance.  He trying to beguile less educated Hispanics with Sí Se Puede while trusting that no one will ask, &#8220;¿Pero qué se puede?&#8221;,&#8221;But what can be done&#8221;? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to like Fred Thompson. He&rsquo;s not pretty, although his wife more than makes up for it, doesn&rsquo;t have the rock star charisma and he can&rsquo;t lay out his ideas in the mandatory three minutes all of which will probably deny him the nomination. Go to his website to get an accurate picture of Fred.</p>
<p>There is also a growing movement to get Lou Dobbs into the fray. Lou has stated that he doesn&rsquo;t want to get down in the muck and mire that characterizes political campaigns these days.<br>
There is another guy who speaks for the middle class.</p>

			<p>Hispanics are never going to vote for a black (in large numbers). I predict Hillary will win Nevada. You guys will be surprised how Hispanics and whites will coalesce against blacks in the next 20-30 years. They (we) already do so in prisons and some schools.</p>

<p>If they see that as a real possibility, then it&rsquo;s the result of their room-temperature IQs. Blacks are only 12% of the population here.</p>

Hillary will be back to making pandering, idiotic statements like &#8220;no one is illegal&#8221; and that Republicans are nothing but mean ol&rsquo; racists and sexists. These people will eat it up and the Clintons know this. </p>

<p>And just where are these blacks going to go?  The Republicans?  Don&rsquo;t be absurd.  I&rsquo;m already on shaky grounds with the RNC over immigration.  I&rsquo;d tear up my voter registration (and so would millions more) over something like this.  I&rsquo;ve been saying for years that the Democrats were trying to wean themselves off the black vote using hispanics.  The blacks are just going to have to suck it up and take a backseat or form their own political party.</p>

<p>So true, but Hillary Clinton doesn&rsquo;t respect white males either.<br>
I quote Camille Paglia in Salon who says &#8220;Hillary&rsquo;s willingness to tolerate Bill&rsquo;s compulsive philandering is a function of her general contempt for men. She distrusts them and feels morally superior to them.&#8221;  Ms. Paglia, an openingly gay Obama supporter,<br>
continues &#8220;Hilary&rsquo;s distain for masculinity fits into the classic feminazi package, which is why Hillary acts of Gloria Steinem like catnip.&#8221; Thank you Camille you are braver than most white male commentators.  Her complete essay is at<br>

With the Republicans not giving enough support to common sensers like Ron Paul in favour of Mumbles Thompson, Smilin&rsquo; Mitt and John McCrazy, get ready for the dropping of an &#8220;H-bomb&#8221; on Washington in November.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s been great fun watching the Democrats tripping over themselves to comment on how wonderful it is that there&rsquo;s a black man and a female (and don&rsquo;t forget that Hispanic guy) running for president.  And how this is all a sign that Americans have &#8220;grown up&#8221; and gotten past race and gender and superficial things like that, and are finally embracing people for who they are inside, for their message.  </p>
<p>Oh, wait&hellip;blacks are voting for Obama because he&rsquo;s black, and women are voting for Hillary because she&rsquo;s a woman, and Hispanics are not voting for Obama because he&rsquo;s black.  I guess many Americans haven&rsquo;t gotten past all those &#8220;superficial&#8221; things, after all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely sickening to watch Hillary pander to minorities.  Is there anything more disgusting, more pathetic, than a guilty white liberal?  I&rsquo;ll take a race-conscious black or hispanic any day to a white liberal.  I&rsquo;m still waiting for someone, preferrably a black person, to ask Hillary why she doesn&rsquo;t just step down from the race and allow Obama to get the nomination, since that would be the logical outcome of all the things she&rsquo;s fought for through the years.  I&rsquo;m sorry, but in her case race trumps gender because she&rsquo;s part of the ruling class.</p>
<p>God, I hate the Marxist legacy.      <br>

			<p>No, Hillary Clinton does not respect Mexicans, nor does Barak Obama. Nor do ANY of the politicians when all is said and done.<br>
But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. </p>
<p>The question to be decided is whether White America can possibly stomach another four year Clinton Administration. (Have we forgotten the foul stench of the earlier eight years?)</p>

			<p>&hellip;&hellip;..does not respect &#8220;our&#8221; people, &#8220;our&#8221; people, Our People. Now there&rsquo;s a good definition of racism for you. How many liberal progresives get it? Very few.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hillary has no respect for our people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor, it would seem from the news excerpt below, do Black people.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;HOUSTON   &mdash;   Three suspects have been targeting – and shooting – maintenance workers in the Greenspoint area, and police say it&rsquo;s simply a miracle that no one has died.</p>
<p>Yes, the article shows a picture of one of the Afro-Americans preying on Hispanic people. Follow the link below and read it for yourselves. So much for Jesse Jackass&rsquo;Rainbow Coalition and their common cause. Given Blacks seemingly love to target Latino victims.</p>
