						<p>There&rsquo;s been a long-term decline in teen pregnancy for every ethnic group, but growing efforts are being made to address an underlying trend: Hispanic girls have by far the highest rate of teenage births in the state and the nation.</p>
<p>Bilingual counseling is an increasing part of programs aimed at keeping girls in high school during and after their pregnancies.</p>
<p>At Port Chester High School, a support group helps teenage girls manage day care, breast-feeding, and emotional and family issues so that they can continue studying. Pregnant and mothering students participate in weekly meetings at the school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About half of Hispanic teenagers are likely to become pregnant before age 20, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. The risk is three in 10 among teenagers overall.</p>
<p>The disparities are greater in the statistics on teen births. In New York in 2005, the teen birth rate for Hispanic girls was 59 per 1,000, compared to 40 for African-American girls and 14 for non-Hispanic whites. The statistics were compiled by teenpregnancy.org.</p>
<p>Those rates have fallen markedly since 1990 for every group, but the decline is not as dramatic for Hispanic girls as for others.</p>

			<p>  Provide a source of food, shelter and water and you have what we call in the pest control industry an &#8220;infestation&#8221;.</p>
<p>  Classic example of a group of parasites taking advantage of the accomodations of an unsuspecting host; Hispanics of the illegal variety have figured out *exactly* how to survive and gain in our society to the exclusive benefit of themselves and not the host!<br>
  Just like insects, and the Borg, these people are out for the collective benefit of La Raza.  Can&rsquo;t say I blame them.  </p>

			<p>Years ago in Mexico, when some peasant woman came into the hospital for her fourth or fifth delivery, the doctors would just go ahead and sterilize her without even telling her about it. Perhaps we need to start doing the same here.</p>

			<p>Another shinning example of &#8220;family values.&#8221; These people are not to be believed. Looks like the Church would speak out against this practice. I think the Mexican men find this practice macho. Everytime they have a baby, it gets automatic citizenshp, allows the illegal parents an opportunity to stay and cost the American taxpayer a bundle. All of this is brought to you by our own government. Better get Ron Paul in there. He&rsquo;ll stop the &#8220;jackpot babies.&#8221;</p>

			<p>     Fifty years ago the government built two high rise apartments in the city in which I lived. They quickly became known as the &rsquo; Baby Factory&rsquo; and the &rsquo; Incubator &#8216;.Nearly all the residents were either black or hispanic. On almost all the doors there were signs which read, &rsquo; This is a Catholic Home.Please do not solicit donations for other religions.&rsquo; At the bottom of each sign was a picture of the Virgin Mary. She was the only virgin in the place. They did a survey and found that more than half the babies born there were out of wedlock children. To make a long story short, the buildings were condemned and torn down thirty years later.</p>

<p>Oh boy, where to begin. Firstoff, bilingual education, in high school. How did they get to high school without learning English? Why is the program designed to keep them in high during and after thier pregnacy, instead of preventing them from getting pregnant in the first place? Lastly, what the heck is a non-Hispanic white?, and why is Hispanic capitalized and whites not? </p>

			<p>Pardon me if I&rsquo;m politically incorrect, but my first reaction was &#8220;If only we could get white women to do that!&#8221;</p>
<p>God bless the Mexicans: they&rsquo;re people too. They&rsquo;re just not OUR people.</p>
<p>Lothrop Stoddard predicted our predicament 80 years ago in his book &#8220;The Revolt Against Civilization.&#8221; As raised living standards and Europeans&rsquo; ethical sensitivity provide more opportunities for high-IQ women, they turn their backs on motherhood in favor of becoming partners in law firms and harassing military services into letting them fly (and crash) fighter jets. The relatively lower-IQ races still make as many babies as ever, thereby shifting the IQ bell curve to the left. For the most part, the few white babies who aren&rsquo;t aborted are either neglected completely or turned over to undocumented alien nannies and ability-hating public school bureaucracies.</p>
<p>Until 1965, the U.S. Census Bureau collected data on married, single, divorced and widowed Americans down to the age of 14. Women are biologically ready to start having babies in their teens, as the human race has known for thousands of years and as the Mexicans and other races put into practice. What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?</p>

			<p>Hispanics have no family values. Where did this myth come from? Because many are Catholics don&rsquo;t mean they are like white people. Most Hispanics here in America descend from  a peasant culture, where you breed like animals. They are not civilized nor do they take responsibility for their families. There are many many single mother homes with no fathers. </p>
<p>The only model minority stereotype that appears to be mostly borne out is by the E. Asians. They do have a sense of shame and honor and respect for intact families. Compared to them, the Hispancs live, breed, and act like unprincipled barnyard animals. They are also extremely criminal.</p>
<p>Why do people buy into this image of nice safe Hispanics? The E. Asians I do business with say that they get along with the Hispanics because they remind them of simple uncouth peasants of the past in their own countries, they say such people have to be handled with a firm hand. They have no illusions about these people and refuse to give in an inch if they misbehave. </p>

			<p>Producing more babies than you can feed, without a handout, should not be considered good parenting, and is  dishonorable. This sort will starve by the thousands when we no longer have the excess food to bestow upon them.</p>

<p>Actually, according to some sources, &#8216;birth control&rsquo; was practised to an extent by medieval European communities, even up to the 19th Century.</p>
<p>But I think that, especially with the massive government defecit, America (especially White America, I might add) should just stand up and say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough - have all the bastard offspring you want, don&rsquo;t worry about &#8216;keeping it in your pants/your legs shut&rsquo; etc - but please, don&rsquo;t expect the American taxpayer to subsidise your spawn&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ah well - a guy can dream, right?</p>

			<p>More evidence for the fall of civilization in the late, no-longer-great USA  &mdash;   even in the once lily-white Hudson River Valley, NY, Blacks and Latinos are growing so fast in population that the founding White segment of the population is disappearing into irrelevance.  Even more fun is in store folks, if the Clintons are elected in 2008, since a major plank of their campaign is &#8220;targeted resettlement&#8221; (with attendant welfare benefits and affirmative action, of course) of millions of non-Whites from Africa and the Middle East into the few remaining enclaves of the country that still are majority-White.  IOW, bye-bye to the last shred of Western civilization in this nation.</p>
<p>Folks, the 2008 election is an *existential battle for our very survival* here.  The Clintons are corrupt and selfish beyond comprehension, their only goal being the enhancement of their own power, and if they&rsquo;re elected they intend to create a permanent majority for themselves and their hand-picked successors by flooding what&rsquo;s left of the Red States with easily manipulable Clintonistas.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already run into quite a few White Americans, already fed up with the PC idiocy that has overrun this country as it is and getting close to emigrating back to their ancestral countries in Europe (esp Germany, Italy and Scandinavia), which seems to be gaining popularity these days.  Most have decided to stay for now, but I&rsquo;ve talked to quite a few hard-working White folks who point out that an election of Hillary in 2008 would be the last straw  &mdash;   they&rsquo;ll leave the USA for good if the Clintons were to come into office yet again, as this would make the country no longer recognizable anymore.  We cannot allow this!!!  I repeat, this is *an existential battle* for us, and the Clintons must be stopped in the ballot box  &mdash;   if they gain control of the halls of power, nothing in the world can stop them from destroying what&rsquo;s left of this country.  </p>
<p>What this means, in practical terms, if that if you&rsquo;re White and voting-age in a state that&rsquo;s being demographically overrun and turned Blue  &mdash;   states such as New York (of course), California, Arizona, New Mexico, Illinois, Hawaii, Vermont, Maryland and Michigan  &mdash;   please, take the opportunity now to move to a nice, more solidly White Swing state which we must win to block the Clintons from power, and register to vote.  You&rsquo;ll get multiple benefits by moving your family here  &mdash;   not just stopping the Clintons, but also a stronger Western society and even lower cost of living.  These states to move to: Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, West Virginia, Delaware and Oregon.  For those of you who already *have* moved to a European country like Italy or Germany, sign up to vote in the USA elections by absentee ballot.  Remember, if the Clintons come into power, after destroying the West here in the USA, they&rsquo;ll target those of you in Europe soon enough.  The 2008 election is a concern for all of us.  We may not be able to prevent some kind of partition of the USA in the near future along racial lines, but at least we can have some future on this continent.  But only if we defeat the Clintons, whose express aim is to deny White society any refuge whatsoever in the North American continent!</p>

			<p>Well get ready for more of the same. The front runners in both politcal parties (O&rsquo;Bama, Clinton, McCain and Huckabee) are all open borders globalists. If any of the members of this group become president we will all live to see the demise and break-up of the United States. </p>
<p>This may not be a bad thing however,because the resulting smaller nations would most likely be be based on ethnic, racial and lingusitic homogeneity.</p>

<p>MY point, exactly. If they stopped breeding like rats and limited population to a size their country CAN support, we wouldn&rsquo;t be flooded with these trash people. Here in America, they learn to manipulate our sysem to their benefit. Knowing they can drop baby after baby, the costs PAID by our government, along with the flow of welfare checks.</p>

			<p>Hispanic females substitute the logic and deductive reasoning they lack with emotions over which they have no control.  They are obsessively zealous in their belief that our entire country rightfully belongs to them and they are determined to produce as many offspring as possible in order to achieve demographic dominance.  However, because they lack logic and deductive reasoning they are oblivious to the fact that we can and will reduce their numbers dramatically once the balloon goes up and all their efforts will come to naught&hellip;          </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about moving to my ancestral homeland in Europe.  It seems the US doesn&rsquo;t value us anymore so why not go where you&rsquo;re valued? I&rsquo;m thinking about it.

			<p>They breed like rabbits in their own countries; why would we expect them to do anything else here?  They don&rsquo;t use birth control because they believe that&rsquo;s a sin, but being in gangs, robbing, raping, beating their wives and neglecting their children all seem to be acceptable in their &#8220;culture.&#8221; Now, how long will our country remain non-third world while its third world population soars? They will all live like one, big happy family under their beloved President Obama. </p>

			<p>Trust me, their high birth rates will eventually turn the entire hudson valley into a wasteland. I live in Yonkers and  Hispanics are already 25% of the population. They, along with the blacks, were on 14% of the population in the mid-1980s. Hopefully I wont live here when we eventually become the minority. </p>

			<p>Elrey, &#8220;targeted resettlement&#8221; is just a rephrasing of the &#8220;placement&#8221; programs that were used, for example, to bring tens of thousands of Somalis into Lewiston, Maine.  It&rsquo;s a segment of the immigration code that federal bureaucrats have wide leeway to enforce, and thanks to the chain migration policies stemming from 1965, fed officials have wide latitude in bringing in tens of thousands of people from Africa or Latin America under &#8220;diversity&#8221; schemes and planting them anywhere.  </p>
<p>The Clintons have long been big fans of using the immigration cudgel to weaken political opposition  &mdash;   which Bill Clinton did, quite successfully, in 1996, by rushing millions of illegals and premature legals onto the citizenship rolls  &mdash;   and both Clintons are in favor of bringing large numbers of &#8220;refugees&#8221; (whether they actually are or not) into &#8220;undersettled communities&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s all Orwellian Newspeak, but it&rsquo;s easy to see that &#8220;undersettled&#8221; or &#8220;open&#8221; means &#8220;too White&#8221; in reality, which is what they want to take down.  It&rsquo;s getting difficult to escape this anywhere in the country, which is why I guess so many Whites have been leaving for good.  The ones in Germany, Italy and Scandinavia often seem to have ethnic ties there, and if they know the relevant languages, their tendency to move is quite high.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The manhunt is on for a 35-year-old man accused of sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl. Guadalupe Rojas is charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child. Police say Rojas assaulted the child several times.</p>
<p>Looking at it one way: Another Mexican immigrant coming to do jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do. Looking at it another way: Still another explanation for WHY American taxpayers are having to support to many illegitimate Hispanic kids   &mdash;   in addition, of cuss, to being required to pay all those hospital birthing bills.</p>
<p>Stories like this nevertheless have a way of surfacing. In spite of the efforts to &#8216;censor&rsquo; the news   &mdash;   so we decent, hard-working American voters and taxpayers can keep our minds off the immigration problem and properly focused on the sports scores and soap operas played in real life by Hollywood starlettes. Stuff we SHOULD be concentrating on. Have many people made the connection between the vast amount of garbage blasted over the media (print and electronic) about the antics and insanities of Britney, and others? Try telling ME that our controlled media doesn&rsquo;t go overboard hyping up that kind of nonsense to keep our minds off of what we, as Americans, SHOULD be thinking about.</p>
