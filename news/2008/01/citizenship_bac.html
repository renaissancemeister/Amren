						<p>The unprecedented 1.4 million surge in U.S. citizenship applicants won&rsquo;t translate into an equal number of new voters come November&rsquo;s presidential election because of a processing backlog.</p>
<p>But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials said Monday that the agency is hiring more staff and pressing the FBI for more efficient background checks and that delays of weeks just to open mail are behind them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The agency has said it will take up to 18 months to process applications at some locations, though applicants in Dallas can expect a six- to seven-month wait.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Dallas, the backlog isn&rsquo;t as serious, with 30,000 applications pending in November, Mr. Aytes said. The number of applicants here increased 49 percent in the last fiscal year compared with the previous year. In San Bernardino, Calif., the increase was 1017 percent; in Los Angeles, 101 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Fee increase played role</b></p>
<p>About half of the new naturalization applications were received in June and July &mdash; an increase of 350 percent from the previous year, officials said.</p>
<p>Many legal permanent residents were prompted to apply by an increase in the application fee to $675 from $400 at the end of July. Others said they were motivated by the spreading backlash against both illegal and legal immigrants, who&rsquo;ve been criticized for &#8220;chain migration,&#8221; or the petitioning on behalf of relatives in Latin America via legal immigration channels.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because freshly minted citizens generally turn out at the ballot box, Latino political analysts pay particularly close attention to the naturalization process. A study by the Latino elected officials organization, or NALEO, showed that the turnout rate in 2002 for Latino naturalized citizen voters was 34 percent compared with about 30 percent for native-born Latinos.</p>
<p>Latino voters, like others, care about the economy, education and the war in Iraq, said Rosalind Gold, NALEO&rsquo;s senior director of policy research and advocacy. &#8220;But they want to make sure that newcomers are not scapegoated and unfairly blamed in our immigration debate, and that is part of the motivation for getting out to vote,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Some 57 percent of Hispanic registered voters call themselves Democrats or say they lean toward the Democratic Party, while 23 percent align with the Republican Party, according to a recent Pew Hispanic Center survey. The October-November 2007 survey of about 2,000 Latinos had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points, in general, and 4 percentage points for registered voters surveyed.</p>

			<p>How many of those illegals had children in this country who are then called American citizens?  What a discrace.  It is no wonder their is so much distrust and hatred for each other.  Our nation state is collapsing and we don&rsquo;t even know what the next step is.  We need a citizens class action suit to imprison our federal Gov&rsquo;t for failure to uphold its constitutional duties. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m listening to the lead-in for the democratic fight (excuse me, I mean debate), and I am thoroughly sick of hearing about the<br>
&#8220;critical&#8221; Latino vote! No one has asked for the white vote, so why should be give it. I&rsquo;d really like to know what is different?<br>
Shouldn&rsquo;t we all want good jobs, good schools for our kids, a peaceful existance? What do the Latinos and African-Americans want that is so different from us? I&rsquo;d really be interested in knowing the answer to this question.</p>

			<p>Plenty of time for a republican to get elected, major immigration reform to pass, and those people to be deported.</p>
<p>Democracy works.</p>

			<p>NOW what are you going to do Patriot?</p>
<p>No matter whether it is Clinton or Obama, both are open borders/ amnesty advocates. The Democrats do not even admit that the issue is worth discussing&hellip;.their mind is made up.</p>
<p>If the Republicans run McCain, like Bush, another open borders/ amnesty cheerleader, then the discussion simply will not take place. Seventy to eighty percent of Americans want the illegal immigration stopped and the border secured. Who is listening to the voters (of either party)?</p>
<p>The only hope left is to STOP John McCain from getting the nomination so the American people will finally get a voice on the issue of illegal immigration. Romney may not be perfect (by any stretch of the imagination), but at least he is not an open borders/amnesty advocate. At least he will DARE to speak up before the election and give the American people a CHOICE on this issue.</p>
<p>On a more positive note&hellip;..We have already endured two presidential terms of the most enthusiastic supporter of open borders/amnesty in this country&rsquo;s history. If the wooden headed dummy can be stopped by citizen outrage, I feel sure we can achieve the same no matter who gets elected. Unfortunately, we have to win every single battle and the amnesty advocates need only win once. We cannot afford to slip or we lose forever.<br>

			<p>When will people realize this country was never intended to be a democracy.  It is a republic!  The drive to get everyone voting is hurting this country.  Uninformed voters respond to name recognition instead of substance.  When only landholders could vote it ensured that they had a real stake in this country.  <br>
We need to send these people back where they came from if they abused the system.  If they were recently illegal then they are here in violation of US law.  Send them home.  Mexico is already crying from the mexicans returning home.  Lets give them all back.</p>

			<p>I totally agree that this push to get everyone to vote is ridiculous! Over 50% of those who do vote are incompetent and a disgrace to what America was meant to be. Blacks or any other nonwhite should have never been given citizenship, let alone any &#8220;rights&#8221;! All they do is vote themselves in more entitlements and more group rights at the expense of White Americans. I am beginning to believe that women(and I am one) should not be allowed to vote. Most are a bunch of whinning, liberal,&#8221;do-gooders&#8221; that are taking this nation to ruin.</p>

			<p>As so many people have pointed out in so many places, there is no need whatever, even if one wanted to, to pull tricks on Hispanic voters.  A large majority of Hispanics in this nation do not qualify to vote. This article is nonsense. Many, many hispanics, at the present time, are either too young to vote, or here illegally, period. </p>
