						<p>A jury convicted a man Tuesday of raping another man, one of five sexual assaults he is accused of committing on men in an eight-month spree in 2006. The sentencing phase of the trial was to begin later Tuesday for Keith Hill, who could receive anything from five years&rsquo; probation to life in prison for aggravated sexual assault.</p>
<p>The trial focused on just one of the cases against him: A May 2006 attack of a teenager who said he was forced to perform oral sex at gunpoint after he was abducted from his driveway near Houston.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hill, 20, pleaded not guilty to the attacks, and his attorney, Lane Lindsey, said Tuesday that a confession he gave to Harris County Sheriff&rsquo;s Sgt. Shane McCoy in February may have been coerced.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in his closing arguments, prosecutor Spence Graham said it should be easy for the jury to convict Hill because his semen was found on the victim&rsquo;s shirt and because his confession included information that only the actual assailant could know.</p>
<p>Hill did not testify and his attorney did not present any witnesses before making closing arguments on Tuesday morning.</p>

			<p>This guy gives the lie to all the things we`ve been taught about how gay men are peaceful victims of homohobia. Why is this guy still alive if he was in the same court room as the victim?<br>
     We have indeed become a whipped bunch of dogs who live in fear of black thugs wanting our money and women, and now it appears us. I wonder what Obama thinks about the jury who convicted this typical gay. Maybe King`s dream is a nightmare after all.<br>

			<p>One simple rule. Run when they pull out the gun. Run when they pull out the gun. Run when they pull out the gun. Got it yet? Or better yet, run while pulling out your own gun. On a similar note&hellip; I`ve realized I have that wanderlust gene. The one that leaves you under a bridge at fifty pulling on a half empty quart bottle. I keep it in check as best as I can. But it does mean that I like to wander around downtown while intoxicated. One thing I have noticed in a dozen or so years. Black people are always the ones to approach me with their stories or spiels or what have you. Hispanic looking gang bangers are usually only trouble when there is a percieved &#8220;disrespect&#8221; in their direction. What does it all mean? While walking alone downtown I can cant on the brothers harrassing me, while the pachukos can be passed by if I`m not &#8220;staring&#8221; at them or whatever. Life, it`s all about the tactics&hellip;</p>

			<p>Can&rsquo;t give a better reason to have Vermont/Alaskan concealed carry laws in other states: just stick your .38 in your pocket and go out the door. Of course, this is just what the Mayor Daleys and Jesse Jacksons fear, that their &#8220;good boy&#8221; minority thugs would start being properly dropped in the streets.</p>

			<p>Rape at gunpoint nowdays has a life sentence in many jurisdictions.He should get five consecutive life sentences.But he wont be all that bad off.There will be a lot of cute whiteboys where he is going.But forcing himself on them will be a lot harder.</p>

			<p>Just goes to show rape really isn&rsquo;t about sex. It&rsquo;s about degrading the victim and to blacks like hill it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the victim is male or female (he might not even know the difference).</p>

			<p>At least he didn&rsquo;t sully our gene pool by impregnating a white women.  In the old days, even attempted rapists were hung.  This miscreant should be executed.  It is only an indication of our weakness that he won&rsquo;t be.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This case has set a precedent as the first male-on-male serial rapist that the FBI has ever psychologically profiled, Baytown Police Capt. Roger Clifford said Wednesday.&#8221;</p>
<p>And oh what YET another precedent to be proud of in their notorious history.  Wonder if this will go into their absurd, Afrocentric curriculum of &#8220;firsts?&#8221; </p>
<p>Please read the earlier article posted in reference to this case. I don&rsquo;t know the race of Capt. Clifford, but our political hacks in the upper echelons of police departments have all sold their souls to the wicked federal agenda.  Quoted from said article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the attacker was reported to be black with light skin and all the victims were white, Clifford said that race was not an issue.</p>
<p>&#8216;This was just the type that he was physically attracted to,&rsquo; he said.&#8221; </p>
<p>No, of course not.  No matter how heinous black-on-white crime, excuses that defy logic are always used. &#8220;&hellip;just the type that he was physically attracted to&#8221; reaches a new low in pathetic justifications. ATTRACTED? Where is the outrage from the locals? This is the mindless propaganda typically espoused by the despicable NWO establishment press, but this is coming from a police CAPTAIN who deserves not one dime of taxpayer-subsidized retirement.     </p>
<p>If you want to see an anatomy of WHAT the (now) federally-controlled local police consider a VICIOUS hate crime, please see the following that has been ongoing news in my local Marxist rag (note too that the alleged White offender has been put on unpaid leave from his state job and charges upgraded to a felony).  Any White who votes to convict this man should be properly ostracized and labeled a race traitor of the vilest kind (note too the typical behavior of blacks in his account):     </p>

			<p>This behavior is VERY common among Blacks, especially those who have served time in prison.  A few years ago, when &#8220;Suge&#8221; Knight, the owner of &#8220;Death Row Records&#8221; was in court being tried on other charges, it came out under testimony that he had used homosexual rape, or the threat of such rape, against the black rappers that worked for him.  Two of them, were found running through the streets of LA naked by police.  When LAPD questioned them, they told the cops that Suge Knight had forced them at gunpoint to strip naked and &#8220;assume the postion&#8221; so he could rape them as punishment for questioning the percentage they were paid for their rap recordings.  These guys told police that they made a break and ran (naked) out of Death Row Records recording studio before he had a chance to rape them.</p>
<p>By the way MANY BLACK RAPPPERS make reference to homosexual rape of other black men in their rap CD&rsquo;s.  (Especially Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and Westside Connection.) </p>
<p>Also, in that case in Knoxville, Tenn., 3 of the 4 black defendants had taken turns raping the white guy, BEFORE they got around to raping his girlfriend, and then killing them both.</p>
<p>Yes, homosexual rape IS COMMON AMONG BLACKS.</p>

			<p>To its credit, left organization Human Rights Watch published (I believe in 2006) a report on male rape in prisons, entitled &#8220;No Escape  &mdash;  Male Rape in U.S. Prisons,&#8221; in which the high occurrence of black on white rape in prison is discussed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Past studies have documented the prevalence of black on white sexual aggression in prison.(213) These findings are further confirmed by Human Rights Watch&rsquo;s own research. Overall, our correspondence and interviews with white, black, and Hispanic inmates convince us that white inmates are disproportionately targeted for abuse.(214) Although many whites reported being raped by white inmates, black on white abuse appears to be more common. To a much lesser extent, non-Hispanic whites also reported being victimized by Hispanic inmates&hellip;Other than sexual abuse of white inmates by African Americans, and, less frequently, Hispanics, interracial and interethnic sexual abuse appears to be much less common than sexual abuse committed by persons of one race or ethnicity against members of that same group.&#8221;</p>
<p>The entire report is at:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report.html</a></p>
<p>and the section that deals specifically with black on white male rape (scroll down to section &#8220;Race and Ethnicity&#8221;) is at:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report4.html#_1_27" rel="nofollow">https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report4.html#_1_27</a></p>
<p>I get a fairly high exposure to reality-as-seen-by-the-true-left from radio KPFA here in Berkeley, and I&rsquo;ve never heard them mention this report, you&rsquo;ll be surprised to hear.</p>
<p>And, when I used to see more MSM, I noticed that prison rape was often a joke, with the perpetrator being a big white guy named &#8220;Bubba.&#8221; </p>
<p>When I first came to Berkeley 35 years ago I met a guy who had told two street persons that they could get toilet paper from the bathrooms on the UC Berkeley campus. The campus cops caught them, the two perps squeeled on Mr. Big (or, &#8220;Mr. T.P. himself,&#8221; as one person I told this story to put it), and the guy was arrested and spent the night in the regional lock-up, Santa Rita, where he was raped, I now presume by blacks, though of course at the time all of us hearing the story had to feign to ourselves disinterest in the race of the rapist, and so we didn&rsquo;t ask).</p>
<p>That white guy that dragged a black guy behind his truck some years ago  &mdash;  there were reports by some inmates who had known the white guy in prison that he probably was raped there by black inmates (but I wasn&rsquo;t able to find any statements that said more than &#8220;probably&#8221;).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an opportunity for some investigative reporter who wants to make a name for himself and his newspaper. (Yeah, sure.)</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a proven fact that rape is a crime of control rather than a sexual crime. So with what I can see here black raping only white would seem to indicate HATE CRIME of course he is a poor down trodden black so I&rsquo;m sure that won&rsquo;t be mentioned</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;ve been told for years now that sex crimes are not really about sex but about power, the implication being that men who attack women do so to force them into submission. </p>
<p>When a black man forces himself upon white men, is the same principle not in effect?<br>

<p>Anonymous at 10:03 PM:</p>
<p>There was another MSM story about this timely subject from the Houston Chronicle (?), and the end of the article had your admonition that rape is more about power than sex.  They just didn&rsquo;t link it to race and racial hate.  Another Chron article said that Mr. Hill admitted that he wanted to have &#8220;power&#8221; over someone:</p>

			<p>He will just continue to rape Whites in prison now. Blacks commit rapes at fantastic rates, especially inter-racial rape. For them it is a power trip to rape a White.</p>

			<p>A handgun is a girl&rsquo;s best friend.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Harry Browne</p>
<p>The ONLY thing that prevents a rape is a gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Raw data from the Justice Department&rsquo;s annual National Crime Victim Survey show that when a woman resists a stranger rape with a gun, the probability of completion was 0.1 percent and of victim injury 0.0 percent, compared to 31 percent and 40 percent, respectively, for all stranger rapes (Kleck, Social Problems, 1990).</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The best conclusion from available scientific data, then, is when avoidance of rape has failed&hellip; a woman&rsquo;s best option is to resist with a gun in her hands..&#8221;</p>
<p>As the crime-prone segment of our population unfortunately increases one would be foolish NOT to carry a gun for self-protection and protection of one&rsquo;s loved ones  &mdash;  legal or not, I&rsquo;d rather take my chances on a gun charge (isn&rsquo;t that what Bernie Goetz was charged with?) than an assault, rape or murder.</p>
<p>As I and my loved ones are White is this not even more imperative as Whites are being hunted and targeted for great bodily harm, robbery, assault and worse?</p>
<p>Handguns  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t leave home without them.</p>

			<p>If you read the account in the paper, the rapist tries to make himself look like a victim. He claims a white man knocked on his door when he was a child and tried to touch him and that he prayed to God. What bull. He&rsquo;s just a mean vicious criminal, that&rsquo;s all.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve never bought the argument, pushed by feminists, that &#8220;rape isn&rsquo;t about sex, it&rsquo;s about control&#8221;.  Yeah, right.  And robbery isn&rsquo;t about money, and grand theft auto isn&rsquo;t about cars.</p>
<p>I believe that control and domination is part of it, but, given the nature of the act, I assume that sexual gratification plays a role as well.</p>
<p>Which brings up this obvious point.  In what way is sending a male rapist to prison, one place where male rape is essentially condoned, punishment?  Aren&rsquo;t we just sending him to happy-land?  Wouldn&rsquo;t, in this case, sending him to Hell be a better option?</p>
<p>In many of the stories here, I have detected, shall we say - certain proclivities - of many black men (the not inconsiderable fraction of black men who are inclined toward the &#8220;thug-life&#8221;).  They seem to be into the whole man-on-man thing.  Also, they live out a pathetic existence where it is expected that one will eventually end up in stir, often for a very long time.  Perhaps these two things are not unrelated.  Perhaps the former explains their seeming indifference to the latter.</p>

			<p>Didn&rsquo;t the Knoxville murderers also sexually assault both the young white man and his girlfriend?  There is some kind of pattern here and many commentors have it exactly right:  Humiliate, rape and sometimes kill.  <br>
Everyone here who posts regularly knows this and it has been said before, but I like to repeat it for anyone passing through, especially liberals and others not familiar with reality of black crime:  You will be targeted because of your race.  The police will not be around to help you, they will show up later only to either take your report as you recover in a hospital or draw a chalk outline around your body.  If you can carry a gun do so.  Learn how to use it.  If you can&rsquo;t legally carry one arm yourself to the best of your ability, discertion and budget.          </p>

			<p>Over and over again I read about crimes of blacks against whites that clearly fall into the hate crimes definition, dismissed by the police as not falling into a hate crimes catagory, ofen before the facts are even known. This behavior, repeated over and over, skews the statistics on hate crimes in favor of blacks and renders the point of hate crimes legislation moot. Incredible!</p>

			<p>Most Whites don&rsquo;t seem to know that blacks &#8216;laaa dem White boys&rsquo; just as much as White girls!! When I was in high school a black guy sitting at the desk next to me went &#8220;pssst, Tom look,&#8221; when I looked I saw that he had his &#8220;thing&#8221; out and erect right there in class!!! I just about fell out of my chair!! I never would sit next to him after that. I was constantly being &#8220;hit on&#8221; by black males. Both my sons have told me the same. So if you have sons, I would STRONGLY advise you to pay attention to any black males that seem to be a little too &#8220;close and friendly&#8221; to them. As for the article, I couldn&rsquo;t believe the police saying that although ALL the victims were White, race had nothing to do with it and that thats just what he was attracted to!!! Do any of you think that would play if the races were reversed? So I guess if I go out and shoot JUST blacks I could say that race had nothing to do with it, that thats just the ones I liked to shoot! Im always amazed at the stupid statements that are made to cover up black on White crimes </p>

			<p>I remember a Black woman who posted on this board a few months ago about her nephew who served a year in prison in the midwest. He was in a predomiately White jail. She told stories of how he was forced to perform oral sex on certain White inmates so that he would not be harmed and how he was traded back and forth among several white inmates.</p>
<p>The fact is that there are Blacks who are raped by Whites in prison as well.</p>

<p>What an astute insight. I had never even thought about that before, but it fits the agenda of our Leviathan&rsquo;s hate, smear, and destroy Whitey propaganda perfectly. It&rsquo;s the same diabolical planning that was the catalyst for smuggling hispanics into White perp stats. But it&rsquo;s no accident that this IS ALWAYS the case.  As to never leveling charges against blacks for &#8220;hate crimes,&#8221; it is being orchestrated as set-in-stone policy from above by THOSE who own and control the media and even now our local police.    <br>

			<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve never bought the argument, pushed by feminists, that &ldquo;rape isn&rsquo;t about sex, it&rsquo;s about control&rdquo;. Yeah, right. And robbery isn&rsquo;t about money, and grand theft auto isn&rsquo;t about cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the reasoning is. Rape just like robbery is wrong, it&rsquo;s a crime and the person should be severely punished.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Which brings up this obvious point. In what way is sending a male rapist to prison, one place where male rape is essentially condoned, punishment? Aren&rsquo;t we just sending him to happy-land? Wouldn&rsquo;t, in this case, sending him to Hell be a better option?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, because again it is about choice. A male rapist may find sexual gratification forcing another male as well as satifying his need for dominance but it won&rsquo;t be happy land unless the male rapist is in control and he won&rsquo;t be if he is raped. There is no joy for anyone to be forced to do something they don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t assume that I am as obtuse as you are.  Yes, I am aware that rape is an awful crime and ought to be severely punished.  What do you think I meant when I wrote that we should &#8220;send him to Hell&#8221;?  I wasn&rsquo;t talking about giving him a ticket to see &#8220;Cats&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The state sanctioned line, &#8220;rape has nothing to do with sex&#8221; is simply insane. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out that rape, has something to do with sex. </p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t mind are some of the comments here about this crime. I would certainly enjoy seeing the information class demonize black peoples potential thoughts, too. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It does take a genius, however, and a greater power than any of us here have, to try and prevail against this &#8216;wisdom&rsquo;.</p>

<p>  Even assuming that story was true and not a fabrication, the fact remains that the overwhelming majority of prison rapes and especially inter-racial ones are committed by blacks. Blacks commit more rapes then any other group of people in the world, inter-racial, homo-hetero et al.</p>

			<p>Of course rape has to do with sexual gratification. The real point is that he got an ADDITIONAL pleasure and sense of power from raping and humiliating a WHITE person. This was a hate crime.</p>

			<p>5:48, St.Louis:</p>
<p>I was simply stating information about a post that appeared on this website. In fact, I went back and checked the archives and the post can be found under a story entitled &#8220;Hard Time&#8221; written by Jared Taylor. It was posted on June 15, 2007. The poster was named Denise and she stated that her nephew served a year in a prison in Grand Forks, North Dakota. </p>
<p>I was not arguing whether Whites rape Blacks in prison more than Blacks rape Whites. Either way, anyone who is the victim of prison rape is in a very horrible position. </p>

			<p>There are countless black rapist who go from raping white women on the streets, to raping white men in the prision system. They are called down-low brothers, and are keeping the AID&rsquo;s virus alive and well in the black community. The only difference is, this man attacked white men, before being thrown behind bars. He has even claimed he did it because he supposedly hates gay men. Ironic isn&rsquo;t it? But not at all uncommon among in their way of thinking. Most of whom will still argue that gayness is a white thing.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s hard to imagine, I suppose it can happen, nothing being beyond the realm of possibility.  I&rsquo;m in no position to try to deny it.</p>

<p>The amount of this is very small compared to the reverse  &mdash;  please see the extract from the Human Rights Watch report on prison rape in my post above at 7:28 PM on January 16.</p>
<p>Another relevant extract from that report (I link the report in my post above) is:</p>
<p>&#8220;Inter-racial sexual abuse is common only to the extent that it involves white non-Hispanic prisoners being abused by African Americans or Hispanics. In contrast, African American and Hispanic inmates are much less frequently abused by members of other racial or ethnic groups; instead, sexual abuse tends to occur only within these groups.&#8221;<br>

			<p>As someone who has served time in prison, the fact is James&rsquo;s second comment is on the money. Prison rape is unnacceptable no matter who is the victim of it. Fortunately, for me, I was in a minimum security prison where such activity hardly ever took place, although consensual sex among males did happen now and then. For the reocrd, most of these guys, including me, were straight.</p>
<p>To those of you who are engaging in the &#8220;they rape more than we rape&#8221; argument, you need to drop it. It&rsquo;s perverse! </p>

<p>No, it is not perverse!    It is statistical.   And it matters.</p>
<p>If you have one hundred rapes this way, and one rape that way, they are all wrong, yes, there is no denying it. But they are certainly NOT to treated as having equal gravity.   If you cannot see that simple fact, you are dense!</p>

			<p>Terrible true story. But, it is a potential winning issue for us. Finesse the race issue just a little bit and run for office on a platform of imposing the death penalty for men who commit multi, homosexual rapes - something like &#8220;8 is enough&#8221;. This program will play well with the general White public -the same public that can&rsquo;t understand Libertarian - free market economics. Put it this way;</p>
<p>See this ugly, nasty, multi homosexual rapists?</p>
<p>My opponent and his entire party feels sorry for the rapists of boys, young men - he and they want to use your tax dollars to fund education, counciling for this terrible rapist of boys/men.</p>
<p>I/we don&rsquo;t feel sorry for the rapist, we feel sorry for his victims - elect us and we will line this monster up against a wall and shoot him.</p>
<p>This is a winning political platform. Go with it.</p>
