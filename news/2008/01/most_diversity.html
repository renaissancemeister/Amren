<p>A comprehensive review of 31 years of data from 830 mid-size to large U.S. workplaces found that the kind of diversity training exercises offered at most firms were followed by a 7.5 percent drop in the number of women in management. The number of black, female managers fell by 10 percent, and the number of black men in top positions fell by 12 percent. Similar effects were seen for Latinos and Asians.</p>
<p>The analysis did not find that all diversity training is useless. Rather, it showed that mandatory programs &mdash; often undertaken mainly with an eye to avoiding liability in discrimination lawsuits &mdash; were the problem. When diversity training is voluntary and undertaken to advance a company&rsquo;s business goals, it was associated with increased diversity in management.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, U.S. businesses spend from $200 million to $300 million a year on diversity training, but the new study is one of the first attempts to systematically analyze its impact. What it found is that programs work best when they are voluntary and focus on specific organizational skills, such as establishing mentoring relationships and giving women and minorities a chance to prove their worth in high-profile roles.</p>
<p>&#8220;When attendance is voluntary, diversity training is followed by an increase in managerial diversity,&#8221; said Alexandra Kalev, a sociologist at the University of Arizona, who led the research. &#8220;Most employers, however, force their managers and workers to go through training, and this is the least effective option in terms of increasing diversity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Forcing people to go through training creates a backlash against diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kalev said many trainers and executives told her they were not surprised by her findings. What this means, she said, is that many companies are not just pursuing poor policies, but are doing so even though their own experts know the training is ineffective or counterproductive.</p>
<p>Several experts offered two reasons for this: The first is that businesses are responding rationally to the legal environment, since several Supreme Court rulings have held that companies with mandatory diversity training are in a stronger position if they face a discrimination lawsuit. Second, many companies &mdash; with the implicit cooperation of diversity trainers &mdash; find it easier to offer exercises that serve public relations goals, rather than to embrace real change.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kalev&rsquo;s latest research, which is not yet published, is the second comprehensive analysis that she and her colleagues have done. Her initial study, published in 2006 in the American Sociological Review when she was at the University of California at Berkeley, was the first systematic assessment of diversity training. It found that such training had minimal benefits.</p>
<p>Her new work sought to tease apart what works from what does not. Both studies compared reports that companies filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about the number of women and people of color in management positions with survey data about whether the firms offered diversity training.</p>
<p>All companies with more than 100 workers and federal contractors with more than 50 workers must submit the EEOC reports. To encourage participation in her survey, Kalev promised not to disclose the names of the companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Executives must treat diversity like any other business goal and put someone in charge,&#8221; Kalev said. When companies believe diverse workplaces give them a competitive advantage, they go beyond cosmetic changes. Companies that appointed task forces with the authority and responsibility to increase diversity in top jobs saw the number of female managers increase by 14 percent, the number of black women rise by 30 percent and the number of black men rise by 10 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Frank Dobbin, an organizational sociologist at Harvard and one of Kalev&rsquo;s co-authors, said narratives about interpersonal conflict that are sometimes featured in &#8220;sensitivity training&#8221; can be counterproductive. For one thing, he said, they upset many people, who then actively resist change. But more important, he said, they downplay the importance of organizational structure in embracing &mdash; or resisting &mdash; long-term change.</p>
<p>Women and minorities often fail to get ahead, he said, because people tend to form social groups with others who are like themselves &mdash; and many managers are simply unaware of the talent in their own organizations. Policies that require or explicitly encourage managers to meet with subordinates in different departments can alert managers to talented employees with different social and ethnic backgrounds and help younger employees figure out what they need to do to get ahead.</p>

					<p>Virtually all of the civil rights lawsuits brought against private businesses and corporations by non-whites in recent years are frivolous.  If Corporate America can spend so much money on the diversity-industrial complex, then they could have just as well defended themselves in court to win the lawsuits.  The reason they&rsquo;re so willing to fold to the pressure of the diversity-industrial complex was best said by the Late Great Dr. Samuel T. Francis, when he essentially said that global capitalism and multiculturalism were the yin and yang to each other.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;Companies that appointed task forces with the authority and responsibility to increase diversity in top jobs saw the number of female managers increase by 14 percent, the number of black women rise by 30 percent and the number of black men rise by 10 percent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Translation: what Comrades Kalev and Dobbin have found, is that forced anti-white torture sessions do little more than revolt and disgust whites. That is not very surprising, not at all. They also find that simply taking a group of people and giving them dictatorial &ldquo;authority and responsibility to increase diversity,&rdquo; gets more results then a corporate version of the Cultural Revolution. Again, is anyone surprised? Indeed, diversity is going to be amplified, when someone&rsquo;s or a group of individuals&rsquo; (probably all nonwhites and Red fanatics) sole task is promoting or hiring minorities and women; that is their job and if they don&rsquo;t get results, they would get fired. If these people were hired to increase the number of hamsters and bunny rabbits placed into managerial positions, one would find that they were probably getting smashing results as well.</p>
<p>In effect, this study simply proposes that stealth force works better than the more overt or obnoxious forms of it. </p>
<p>Moreover, it makes the assumption that &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is inherently good and benefits the company in question. They never look at the long term impact on moral and productivity for the workforce or management, only that it is there, that it has been increased. Of course, why would they; looking at such bottom line statistics, would likely burst their rainbow bubble and leave them red faced?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Yes, when they &#8216;believe.&rsquo; They simply have to believe because it cannot be <del>demonstrated</del> that diversity gives anybody a competitive advantage. Here again we have sociologists who know nothing about business simply proclaim that diversity in and of itself is a worthy goal. Because diversity is not a worthy goal with any business value their solution is to do away with sham indocrination sessions and form a task force with the authority to impose quotas.</p>
<p>Diversity training is ineffective because diversity is ineffective. Where is the sociologist to proclaim &#8216;diversity is a crock that nobody buys into&rsquo;? He doesn&rsquo;t exist.<br>

					<p>Humans know that &#8216;diversity&rsquo; of the sort peddled by Marxist Liberal social engineers, is utterly unnatural.</p>
<p>One cannot cram dozens of races and their sub-groups, their individual heritages, cultures and belief systems into one living-space in multiple territories and call it diversity because the fall-out of such social engineering will be a mixture of repetitive miscegenation and civil warfare.</p>
<p>So, the supposed evidence of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; ends up, over time, both being bred out and eliminated altogether.  But, then the Marxist Liberal social engineering destroyers of true diversity know precisely that to be the case already which, in turn, begs a further question; </p>

					<p>  Let me get this straight, first you insult people and they become upset and refuse to see the light? That&rsquo;s unbelievable!</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s really funny, you have groups of people who insult maybe not purposely because they just feel that we people and our views are primitive and take that for a granted. This is just where these people are after years of indoctrination and very little differentiation between those whom they learn the &#8220;truth&#8221; from. Schools are simply indoctrination sessions now.</p>
<p>  These are some of the characteristics which I have noticed either in progressive households or schools.</p>
<p>1.  These people learn from a young age to live with great respect from government for viability as opposed to religious truths.</p>
<p>2.  Reject the culture of their forefathers or at least tradition as a vibrant force by which to cultivate knowledge and embrace universality of all people, cultures, countries.</p>
<p>3.  Truth is essentially relative when addressing that which they embrace and absolute when discussing that which they deny.</p>

					<p>Diversity training is sponsored by racist liberal Bolshevik and racist black people who can never force feed their genocidal anti-white rhetoric down the throats of normal white people.  That is why we nod in class and go to the lunch room and re-educate each other.  We see what is going on and are resisting it every step of the way.  Major backlash I&rsquo;d say.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Diversity training&#8221; is a fancy code word for &#8220;let&rsquo;s make blacks feel better about themselves.&#8221; </p>
<p>It takes the tardy, lazy, rude, pushy, religious black and elevates them to some god-like status as a unique creature in the tapestry of &#8220;diversity&#8221;. </p>
<p>In other words, don&rsquo;t get mad when Bonisha shows up to work late and is rude or obnoxious to the other employees   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s just her &#8220;culture&#8221; and part of &#8220;diversity&#8221;. Don&rsquo;t fire her if you catch her being preachy about Jeez-Us.</p>
<p>No other group in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>benefits from &#8220;diversity training&#8221; other than ignorant and lazy blacks. </p>

<p>No kidding Einstein.  And this little phenomenom has been going on since the dawn of time.</p>
<p>My 10 year old daughter attends a public school in <span class="caps">L.A. </span> We live in a decent neighborhood on the edge of Korea Town.  Her school is racially mixed: Koreans, Whites, a few blacks, and hispanics.  I drop in occasionally during my lunch break and just meet my daughter and actually sit with her during lunch.  The school principal doesn&rsquo;t like it but I really don&rsquo;t care.  The interesting thing is that the students self-segregate based on race during lunch and recess (ie. playtime).  Well, it&rsquo;s not interesting to me, it&rsquo;s rather obvious and natural.  The teachers try to get the kids to &#8220;mingle&#8221; and &#8220;mix&#8221;.  They even have mini &#8220;diversity&#8221; days.  But nothing changes.  The kids still self-segregate based on race (not 100% but close to this).  I&rsquo;m sure it baffles the PC teachers and administrators.<br>

					<p>Diversity is a worthy goal, right up there with making a profit, and a heavy commitment of time, labor and money is required to achieve it. That&rsquo;s why people come to work each morning, to pursue diversity; that&rsquo;s what will feed your children and send them through college, diversity. Making money isn&rsquo;t important; what&rsquo;s important is showing the world that we are warm, caring human beings, committed to ridding the world of white, heterosexual, able-bodied men. That&rsquo;s diversity.</p>
<p>Notice that the principle academics involved involved in this study came from Berkeley and Harvard. Does it surprise anyone that what has been done for women and minorities so far is unacceptable to clowns resident in the squirreliest universities in America</p>
<p>How likely is it that any of us, in the next ten years, are going to be able to get through an entire 24 hours without hearing the words racist, sexist or diversity? It&rsquo;s a little less likely than our chances of winning the lottery.</p>
<p>Why do we tolerate this nonsense?</p>

<p>That could be true for a plurality of whites but at the end of the day there&rsquo;s still a diversity-king in charge and no one dare challenge them. That&rsquo;s why, to avoid discrimination complaints, they all want rock solid proof they are discriminating against whites. </p>

We all know what this is really about.</p>
<p>Diversity training is insurance against a future lawsuit.</p>
<p>If any racial problem crops up, the first thing the minority lawyer representing their aggrieved minority client is going to do is ask the company &#8216;what have you done to promote diversity and tolerance in the workplace?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine any corporation doing this for the sake of racial harmony. While AR readers see it as a waste of money, <span class="caps">CEO </span>and their law department see it as a preemptive maneuver. <br>

					<p>I remember my first diversity training session. The speaker began talking about the standards for harassment of fellow employees and stated that in a male/female situation it would be whatever was considered offensive to a reasonable woman.</p>
<p>I piped up and said &#8220;reasonable woman? that&rsquo;s and oxymoron.&#8221; E Everyone in the room, with the exception of the speaker started laughing, including all the gals. Everyone knew how ridiculous the whole presentation was and that we were all there to just  comply with a government mandate.</p>

					<p>Do I have this right? Women and blacks are openly, plainly, and proudly, discriminating against white men, at every opportunity.

When you take stock of the massive waste that our government has brought about by enacting the forced race mixing laws, you think that our politicians are fools.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather, it showed that mandatory programs &mdash; often undertaken mainly with an eye to avoiding liability in discrimination lawsuits &mdash; were the problem. When diversity training is voluntary and undertaken to advance a company&rsquo;s business goals&hellip;.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>What!  Stop right there.  You show me one successful business in the entire world, in the entire history of businesses, that&rsquo;s run by a person who actually believes that multicultural diversity will advance his company&rsquo;s goal and I&rsquo;ll walk down <span class="caps">MLK</span> Blvd. at 3 AM unarmed.  That&rsquo;s right it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>No white man in his right mind is going voluntarily to a diversity training session.  (Maybe if you offer free food and beer.)  A person smart enough to run a successful business is by definition not dumb enough to believe that multicultural diversity will make his business one bit better.  Therefore the successful business that runs a diversity program is doing it solely &ldquo;with an eye to avoiding liability in discrimination lawsuits&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Businesses have been diversity training for 31 years spending up to $300 million a year, and yet just now undertake a new study that &ldquo;is one of the first attempts to systematically analyze its impact&rdquo;.  This shows that business don&rsquo;t give a hoot about diversity training&rsquo;s merit.   They&rsquo;re in it because they have to be.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo; the problem.  To be successful a business must hire white men; the natural law.  But the government says you must hire non-white men; a law against nature.  There is going to be racial friction.  This is good for government, but bad for people.  Government now needs to expand, create new bureaucracies to enforce its law, and it must further expand, create more bureaucracies to handle the resulting side crimes such as harassment.  As Shakespeare said its appetite increases by what it feeds upon.</p>
<p>So are our politicians fools?  Think of our politicians as that fat chief in the original King Kong movie.  He&rsquo;s fatter today than he was before he passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  And he&rsquo;s going to be fatter tomorrow.</p>

					<p>Where I worked for 20 years before retiring, we started out having &#8220;Quality Days&#8221; where we all convened at some hotel to study what Deming had taught the Japanese about &#8220;Continuous Process Improvement&#8221; and the like.  Since the Japanese were beginning to clean the clocks of American business at the time, this made a certain amount of sense.</p>
<p>But soon &#8220;Quality&#8221; was hijacked and became a synonym for &#8220;Diversity&#8221;.  Quality meant denigrating anything white, male, or heterosexual and worship of blacks, browns, feminists, and gays.  It meant hiring and promoting minorities, women and gays, as a condition for positive performance reviews. It meant mandatory &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; sessions, subsidized minority workers&rsquo; councils and diversity cookbooks.  It meant wasteful, counterproductive silliness, dismissal for rejection of PC and disgruntled employees who spent more time in indoctrination than doing productive work, and who finally took early retirement or resigned to escape.  It ultimately meant the death of that facility.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is &#8220;Quality&#8221; remained the umbrella word, but quality of process or product was never discussed.  I guess they thought we wouldn&rsquo;t notice what we were being fed if they used a sensible word to describe it.</p>

<p>&gt; but when they reach the teens, the minority boys suddenly decide that they want to mix with the white females.  Neglected white girls, the less popular ones, enjoy all the attention.  And therein lies the foundation of the problem of miscegenation.</p>

					<p>Back in the day, I was actually a feminist.  Then my employer hired a diversity trainer.  She focused on sexual harassement never acknowledging the huge amount of sexual harassement White women suffer from black men. According to her, only White men could be sexual harassers.</p>
<p>We were compelled to attend her maoist brainwashing sessions for a couple hours a week for 3 weeks.</p>
<p>At the end of the sessions, I became such an anti feminist that I came to sincerely believe that women should not be allowed to vote, serve on juries, be attorneys or judges or teach.</p>
<p>I was in a bookstore the other day.  I noticed a display of &#8220;How women can succeed in the workplace&#8221; books.  There must be about 10,000 of these type of books published. Those books have advice on everything from hair styles to scheming for a promotion. But one thing none of these type of books every mention, the viciousness and hatred displayed by black women against White women in the work place and how to cope with it.</p>

					<p>Diversity training is not meant to change minds.  It is meant to humiliate and remind whites that they are no longer in control.  It serves as a symbol of the power of the new class and loudly proclaims that they will brook no challenge to their moral authority.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you sleep through these classes, the mere fact that you are there is the shattering reality of their power.  As a symbol, think of diversity training in the same way whites in the South thought of those &#8220;colored&#8221; signs in public restrooms.  As long as they were able to put those signs up, they were the symbol of a people in firm control.  </p>

					<p>The left does everything it can to make Blacks hate Whites. It tells them that they are not to blame for their failings, but Whites are the cause. The Blacks have already bought this line.</p>
<p>But some Whites don&rsquo;t believe all the garbage about White Guilt, institutional racism, systemic racism and other idiocy. This diversity indoctrination is supposed to convince those Whites that they are just disgusting racists.</p>
<p>Nobody likes being called a disgusting racist, especially if he isn&rsquo;t one. </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve posted this before.  In the 1966, just after the civil rights act was passed, my Father was sent by his company to a seminar organized by the auto industry to learn of the effects of affirmative action.</p>
<p>He came back with one sentence &#8220;From now on, every hiring, firing, assingment and promotion decision is grounds for litigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Affirmative action and diversity are nothing more than full employment acts for attorneys and other toxic liberals to earn a living by parasiting on the productive workers and businesses.</p>

<p>The failure of diversity/multiculturalism baffles liberals as does the failure of socialism/communism.  They think they can force equality and go against human nature.  As Bill O&rsquo; Reilly once said, &#8220;liberal ideas are good-they just don&rsquo;t work&#8221;</p>

					<p>Diversity indoctrination is usually trumped by an adult individual&rsquo;s personal experience, survival instincts and common sense.  A child is the most vulnerable to government brainwashing, but eventually he grows up and realizes he was deceived and another liberated born-again conservative emerges from his disintegrating communist cocoon&hellip;</p>

Posted by margaret</p>
<p>Interesting comments, as always, margaret.   I am white, and male, and management. And I know what you mean. I have often witnessed this catty behavior in action. It is a perplexing problem to have to deal with,  a dilemma really, and I don&rsquo;t know if there is <span class="caps">ANY </span>way (for a white woman) to cope with it   &mdash;   other than simply to ignore it.  That seems to be the approach used by those white women who&rsquo;ve been most successful in surviving it.  I say, &#8220;survive&#8221;, since that&rsquo;s the best they can do, because the problem never goes away.  Between the black men, and the black women, a white female can&rsquo;t win.  As for most of the black women, there&rsquo;s generally no way for her to win them over, no matter how she tries    &mdash;   especially if  the white female in question is &#8220;guilty&#8221; of being young, shapely, smart, or pretty.   Black women, I&rsquo;ve long noticed, hate <span class="caps">ANY </span>other female who&rsquo;s younger or thinner than they are, regardless of color    &mdash;   but most especially if the offender is white. To just tolerate it, be good natured, and keep smiling is a poor solution at best, But there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any other.  Above all, she shouldn&rsquo;t respond, because then it will only escalate and get nasty;  the other blacks will not go against another black, and the other whites will not defend another white.   <br>
Any suggestions?</p>

					<p>I worked in an auto plant(white male) and it was a living hell everyday i was in the place. Constant never ending harassment. People are supposed to have a right to a non-hostile work but like a laws rules and regs that doesn,t include white men. According to that one manager not white women either. If you were management, when you saw it why didn,t you stop it? The people who worked for mitsubishi let the whole country know about the conditions in the autoplants. What was one of their main complaints? They said the people they were supposed to report it to, were doing it too. Including union people. The good thing about that was that now the whole country knows about the conditions of the auto plants. The news people called the people doing it boors and children. I guess they thought they were following eeo laws as long as they hired a diverse workforce. They,re moving the plants overseas because of free trade also. Thanks bill clinton and all the other non-representatives in Washington. History shows there has never been a successful multicultural society ever. You have to start thinking they know that and are doing their best to destroy this country so they can step in with their global government.</p>

					<p><b>&#8220;According to that one manager, not white women either. If you were management, when you saw it why didn,t you stop it? &#8221; </b></p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t I?  I didn&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t attempt to stop it (where possible).  I said I &#8220;observed&#8221; that type of bitchyness   &mdash;   often in situations beyond my control.  Generally, all I could do was move someone - to another part of  &#8220;the cesspit&#8221;.   You can&rsquo;t force people to be friendly to one another. You can&rsquo;t  <span class="caps">MAKE </span>them be nice.  If someone brings in a birthday cake or box of candies and passes it around  (except to some), you can&rsquo;t force them to share with <span class="caps">EVERY</span>body. When blacks are the majority, there is a lot of childish behavior going on and there is only so much you can do. You can&rsquo;t correct people&rsquo;s basic behavior and  teach them manners that they never had    &mdash;   what they should have learned at home.   You can&rsquo;t stop people from gossiping and backbiting and giving someone dirty looks.  A hostile tone of voice is not illegal, and if people want to have their own little private cliques, you can&rsquo;t stop them. </p>
<p>As I said, fat middle-aged black women hate <span class="caps">ALL </span>other women (who are younger or slimmer than they are). But white women particularly.  If I &#8220;interferred&#8221; they would bring in <span class="caps">EEO </span>and next thing, I would have a lawsuit(on some fantastic grounds) for showing favoritism to another white. The mere accusation of racism, true or not, is the deathknell for any manager&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>And as far as interfering, there would be <span class="caps">ZERO </span>support  from upper management.  They would say, &#8220;What are you trying to do? Start a war here?&#8221;  Believe me, I know!  All they want is to keep things nice and quiet and have no trouble. The (white) management and the (black) unions would <span class="caps">ALL </span>be united on this.  White management is walking on eggshells and they&rsquo;re all scared stiff of <span class="caps">EEO </span>and legal action.  If you want to keep your job, you have to play their game, and that is &#8220;hear no evil, see no evil&#8221;.</p>
<p>Black women can be very mean. To one another. Your hands are tied, but I tried to help those being treated unkindly - both black and white - in whatever quiet ways I could.</p>

In re-reading my previous post, I want to add this:<br><br>
Spineless white management is the other side of the problem.  They  are all treading in fear for their own jobs, careers, and their own promotions.  Do you think they can do whatever they want?  Do you think they are <span class="caps">ABLE </span>to do whatever they want?  On their own annual evaluations, they  will be rated on  what  they have done to promote Diversity, and on how many <span class="caps">EEO </span>complaints have been made under their watch.  They don&rsquo;t want <span class="caps">ANYONE </span>rocking the boat.</p>
<p>Here on Amren only a few months ago, there was a story about the <span class="caps">CEO </span>of a huge Boston insuance company who told how he would <span class="caps">ORDER  </span>his managers to hire and promote more blacks, and how he would make it clear that <span class="caps">THEIR OWN JOBS </span>would depend on their success in  this. If they couldn&rsquo;t find any qualified blacks, they had better invent some!</p>
<p>Another thing, black (and Hispanic) women can be unprincipled and vicious.  They don&rsquo;t hesitate to hit below the belt in order to get their way in any way they can.  There is NO allegation, however low,  however mean and untrue, that they wouldn&rsquo;t make if it would serve their purpose. A manager has to be very cautious about this.</p>
<p>As I said, most black women over a certain age, <span class="caps">HATE </span>any other female who is younger, thinner, or  <i><span class="caps">LIGHTER  </span></i>than she is. (I neglected to mention that last one previously). By the time they&rsquo;re middle aged, they&rsquo;re likely to be in positions of some authority, so you have to tread cautiously.  I haven&rsquo;t even gotten into the topic of black males here.  That&rsquo;s a whole other story!</p>
<p>In closing, let me just say that I came to the conclusion long ago that <b>only blacks should supervise other blacks.</b> Not only can they deal with them better, and  on their own level, but they are immune to charges of racism or favoritism, so they can&rsquo;t be blackmailed on that basis. For a white person, managing blacks is a nightmare.<br>

					<p>To that white manager it looks like all white people are between a rock and a hard place. But aren,t the workers being harassed between a rock and a hard place also? This was one of the main things the people cited when they went to the eeoc that there was nobody to report anything to. It seems that the union and management would or should be working together to see that eeo laws are enforced. What happened when the news and dateline reported on this bad behavior? People and groups of people called for boycotts of autos. Look how the auto plants are in trouble. Ford calling for another buyout. With free trade they,re moving as much work overseas as possible. To homogenous societys because they are more successful i guess. All this shows (blacks should only supervise other blacks)is that no multcurtural can be sucessful. Judges have said everbody has a right to be left alone, and that everybody has a right to a non-hostile work environment. The insanity of the injustice against whites gets worse daily. Whites are treated in a draconian way and people of color are treated with kid gloves. There is a book called the death of the west. They,re right</p>
