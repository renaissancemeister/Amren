						<p>A large majority of Americans believe cracking down on employers who hire illegal immigrants is the key to immigration reform, according to a poll of participants encompassing most of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Regarding immigration, American Solutions [for Winning the Future, Newt Gingrich, chairman] found:</p>
<p>&nbsp;*&nbsp;77 percent said banning employers from hiring illegal immigrants would reduce the number of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;*&nbsp;78 percent support heavy monetary fines against employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;*&nbsp;83 percent support Internal Revenue Service audits of companies who knowingly hire illegal immigrants if those companies have not paid taxes owed.</p>

			<p>The solution to illegal immigration is really quite simple.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we really need a border fence. Nor do I think we need fines against employers who hire illegals. </p>
<p>1. Make his employer financially liable for any social services he/she has received  <br>
2. Any illegal found to have committed a crime, it is the employer (all those who have employed him) who must be held liable for restitution to the victim(s). </p>
<p>How many would hire an illegal if he thought that 2 years down the road, an attorney might be contacting him regarding paying restitution to a victim of this person&rsquo;s crime? Not many. In fact the pool of employers would dry up pretty darn quick.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
An illegal who commits rape, his employer (including all past employers) would be required to pay the victim $500,000</p>
<p>An illegal who commits a murder, his employer (including all past employers) would be required to pay the victim&rsquo;s immediate family $2,000,000. And so on&hellip;</p>
<p>As for the social cost of the illegal, again, it is the employer that must bear this cost. When an illegal is arrested, find out what social services he/she has used and make the employer reimburse the taxpayer.  This is not hard to do.  </p>
<p>Make the employer responsible for all costs associated with the illegal, as well as bear the cost of financial restitution to the victims of his crimes&hellip; and watch how fast this problem will fix itself!  Remember, it is the employer that is the reason this illegal is here. </p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t understand why attorneys aren&rsquo;t going after employers right now on behalf of past victims?  It would only take ONE precedent setting case to start the ball rolling here&hellip; </p>
<p>If anyone knows any victim(s) of an illegals&rsquo; crime (e.g. rape, assault with bodily injury, or even murder) tell him/her, or the family of a murder victim, to contact an attorney and suggest going after the employer.  </p>

			<p>This is a good start.  If an employer insists on illegal employees, it is also a good idea to strip them of a business license and add some jail time to the fines.</p>

			<p>Not only should we fine employers of these illegals but we should fine and take away the pensions of any senator or congressman/woman..that passes any law that would in any way help these criminals&hellip;and do away with welfare benefits or social security to any of these idiots&hellip;.then and only then will we get rid of them&hellip;once and for all!!!!!!</p>

This is good, but again we see that little word that was used in laws in the 1980&rsquo;s, <i>knowingly</i> (hire). Employers have an easy out  &mdash;   they just say <i>&#8220;we didn&rsquo;t know.&#8221;</i> That aspect needs to be toughened up a few notches, or it remains the weak link in the chain.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;A large majority of Americans believe cracking down on employers who hire illegal immigrants is the key to immigration reform,</p>
<p>I wonder just WHO the people being interviewed are. A large majority?  Funny I&rsquo;ve never known anyone having being polled on this topic. The &#8220;majority&#8221; of Americans I know, favor mass deportation COUPLED with a crackdown on employers.</p>
<p>Sounds suspiciously like the pollster called a few &#8220;known&#8221; cooperators to base his &#8220;majority&#8221; on. I&rsquo;ve come to the opinion ages ago, that polls have about as much validity as a Hillary Clinton campaign promise. Which is to say: ABSOLUTELY ZERO VALUE!</p>

			<p>Cracking down on employers is a good start, but is not the solution. Lots of illegals come here with no intention of getting a job, but to get on public assistance. Ending birthright citizenship and denying illegals ANY form of public assistance, except a one-way ride home, is the next logical step. If those steps are followed there will be no need for &#8220;mass deportations&#8221; as there will be no incentive for them to come here and no means for them to stay if they do. </p>

			<p>Yet again, it seems as if the American public is opposed to the new &#8220;Robber Barons&#8221; out to increase their wealth on the backs of the average American.<br>
But this &#8220;has&#8221; to happen: As long as there&rsquo;s an employment/welfare benefit for them to move to the U.S., they will immigrate - no matter how many extra Border Patrol agents are created.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s going to be another &#8220;report&#8221; about how if illegal immigrants were &#8220;shown the door&#8221;, so to speak the U.S. would enter a massive depression reminiscent to the one in the 30&rsquo;s, the collapse of America, etc etc ad Nauseum.</p>

			<p>While stopping the hiring of illegals is one tool to slow illegal immigration, it&rsquo;s only one in a long list of things which need to be done. Those who employ illegals are also the ones who employ lobbyists to to ensure they won&rsquo;t be targeted by raids. My personal feeling is that the companies that have been targeted for raids are those companies that got out of line in other ways. A percentage of illegals are employeed in small companies, under the table, where it&rsquo;s harder to trace. About 5 years ago I lost my job and applied for unemployment. There was two other people working under my social security number. The guy at the unemployment office actually showed me my printout of how much I paid in, and how much I would be recieving. Under my name were two other people who were paying into unemployment under my SS#. These people were paying unemployment, workman&rsquo;s comp, and social security under my SS#. Since those people are not eligible to collect it, or supposed to not be elligible to collect it, the government just keeps this money. It&rsquo;s aqnother part of the scam. The government knows full well that multiple people are working under one SS#, but they don&rsquo;t fix it, because these people pay in, and can&rsquo;t take out. </p>

			<p>They didn&rsquo;t ask the right question.</p>
<p>What they should have asked is, &#8220;Do you think the US should jail the owners/operators of companies that knowingly hire illegals?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty confident the percentage that say yes would be in the high 80&rsquo;s or even 90&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Other questions they should ask.  &#8220;Do you think hiring illegals is a form of slavery?&#8221;  &#8220;Do you think hiring illegals should be a felony?&#8221;  &#8220;Do you think those who hire illegals are doing so for reasons other than economics?&#8221;  &#8220;Are those who hire illegals, traitors to the United States?&#8221;  etc.</p>
<p>Also, the border fence is absolutely necessary.  But not to keep out illegals.  It&rsquo;s to put a major dent in the amount of drugs coming into the US.  Not only is this overwhelmingly important with regard to crime, social costs etc. but it is probably the most important thing we can do to stop illegals.  They are here to 1) be slaves, 2) steal welfare, and 3) deal drugs.  If the three issues, the last is the most serious.  The most dangerous.  And the one most responsible for illegals being here.</p>

			<p>Employers generally have more procedural rights and financial resources to enable them to mount sophisticated defenses;  illegal aliens themselves, not so, comparatively speaking.  On the other hand, a few active jail sentences handed down to  business owners can spread a lot more consternation among his (the illegal&rsquo;s) world of colleagues than prison sentences and deportations can likewise do among the illegal immigrant prison and street populations.</p>

			<p>Use of the words &#8220;knowingly&#8221; and &#8220;hire&#8221; creates all kinds of deliberate confusion.</p>
<p>There is no confusion, except the smoke screen that they hope will buy them just a little more time to exploit their cheap coolies.</p>
<p>Forget about &#8220;knowingly&#8221;. Require every employer to verify every employee is either an American citizen or in the country lawfully. This does not depend on phoney documents, or fake social security numbers, or sworn statements. From the moment a no-match letter is received by an employer, they are knowingly continuing that employment. Employers must show due diligence in verifying that every employee is legally able to work in the USA, just as they should verify that the employee is healthy enough do perform the work and has the necessary skills, tools and experience.</p>
<p>As long as they keep using the word &#8220;hires&#8221;, business operators are going to insist that it ONLY applies to NEW EMPLOYEES and not the ones they have been harboring for decades in the basement of their home. Employers insist that &#8220;hires&#8221; only applies to FUTURE hires and not the illegal aliens they already have on the payroll. So stop using the word &#8220;hires&#8221;.<br>

Well said, underdog.  That&rsquo;s why fines alone are not enough.  Most large employers who unknowingly (or knowingly) hire illegals would just accept a fine as the &#8220;cost of doing business&#8221;.  Even a fine of, say, $50,000 is peanuts compared to the payroll and health care costs that unscrupulous companies save by employing a workforce largely comprised of illegals.  Think of the millions of dollars that Tyson Foods, for example, has saved over the years by hiring illegals.  </p>

<p>Excellent point. It boggles my mind that people who are here illegally are allowed to get public assistance paid for by our tax money. If we cut off the jobs and cut off the public assistance, illegals will have no choice but to go home. All of this talk about &#8220;border security&#8221; is a bunch of garbage. Candidates know that by talking about securing the borders they can get the support of people concerned about illegal immigration while remaining PC enough to not offend liberals. Whenever I hear a candidate whose illegal immigration plan focuses on border security I know they are full of hot air. Half of the illegals in this country originally came here legally anyway and overstayed their visas. We must have enforcement through attrition. </p>

			<p>Politicans do not want companies in their districts fined or harrassed for hiring illegals, these companies and employers of illegals are huge contributors to the politicans, the politicans intentionally keep ICE and other law enforcement understaffed. It would not matter if 99% said they wanted employers fined, these companies are what keep politicans in office.</p>

			<p>   I wonder how many illegals who come to the U.S. actually find jobs? I bet most of them are hanging out in a relatives house. I believe most legal hispanics in the U.S. actually support the invasion. Blood is thicker than any allegiance to a country. Most mexicans actually harbor illegals. The whole community is sympathetic. They&rsquo;re bad Americans.</p>

			<p>These Mexican illegals ARE NOT blacks, they will not go to an area where there is not work. Even though they are quick to suck up the Freebies foolish Americans offer to law breakers, they for the most part Seek To Work. We need a regulated way to allow the good ones in, with absolutely no Free Stuff until they have been here 10 years (legally). Make finding work extremely difficult and they won&rsquo;t come.</p>

			<p>Individuals of companies that hire illegals need a taste of their own medicine. They need to be stripped of their job with no means to support themselves and their family. They couldn&rsquo;t ask for assistance because those illegals they were helping are taking all the help they can get. Of course, I agree, make it harder for illegals to be here and enforce tougher laws on the traitors. If we had tougher laws, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this mess in the first place. </p>

<p>Your solution sounds harsh, but considering that this is the public policy when it comes to illegal drugs (asset forefeiture) and it is proposed as solutions to drunk driving and digital piracy, it&rsquo;s not without precedent.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a consensus in comments here calling for harsher sanctions against American firms hiring illegals, as the main priority. Sorry, but I think this is wrong, wrong, *wrong*.</p>
<p>If honest business-owners in low-skill industries are continually tempted by third-world peasants who can&rsquo;t speak English walking in off the street, somebody else  &mdash;  guess who!  &mdash;  is clearly not doing their job. </p>
<p>A national boundary  &mdash;  a border  &mdash;  is not a line on a map, it is an entity that, to put it in blunt conceptual terms, exists specifically and emphatically, to divide &#8220;us&#8221; from &#8220;them&#8221;. To the Establishment, &#8220;polite society&#8221;, or &#8220;respectable&#8221; people, this is just another thought to be suppressed  &mdash;  which means the Establishment, as many here know, rejects the very idea of nationhood. They just change the subject when serious discussion threatens, because a nation is *fundamentally* about the validity of the idea of &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221;  &mdash;  about separation, distinction, uniformity, non-diversity. </p>
<p>Well, a nation&rsquo;s integrity  &mdash;  its rightful recognition of the &#8220;other&#8221; and maintaining separation therefrom for the benefit of its citizens  &mdash;  is clearly a government responsibility. No landscaper, contractor, or restaurant owner should have to worry about the citizenship of a job applicant. Those business owners and I pay lots of tax money every year to the people who should be doing that job.</p>
<p>The real questions, regarding mestizo peasants, as well as Mohammed Atta, are and should always be:</p>
<p>Why are they here? Who let them in? And these are not rhetorical questions.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d love to see those who hire illegal aliens fined to the max and placed in jail. I would also like to see something done about the huge number of companies that are promoting illegal immigration and Mexican &#8220;culture.&#8221; For instance, the supermarkets that grovel to Mexicans by placing Spanish labels and signs everywhere. And what I would most like to see is the relocation of illegals to areas dominated by the white liberals who love them. If New Englanders and Iowans adore Mexicans so much and oppose the evil racist South and West who want to deny these poor Mexicans a new life in America then they should, at their own expense, take those Mexicans into their homes and neighborhoods. I would rather see the Mexicans sent to New Hampshire and Iowa than back to Mexico.</p>

			<p>Fines are one of the keys to cutting back on Illegal Immigrants here, large employers of illegal immigrants like the low cost they provide. As soon as the cost of hiring illegals go up, they well find a different way to keep cost low (i.e. machines, out sourcing). Illegals well find America less appealing with job market drying up. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Poll: Employers Key to Stopping Illegal Immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>This has been known for years by the general public, and assidously avoided by the leftist MSM, and the President, and the Senate, and the Congress - with very few, automatically ridiculed exceptions.</p>
<p>Every citizen should realize by now that illegal immigration is an insisted-upon conscious policy by profit-morality corporations who have lost all interest in preserving America, its culture, or its people, and who own and operate the president and Congress on this isssue.</p>
<p>Any politician who doesn&rsquo;t sound like Tancredo or Hunter on illegal immigration is part of this betrayal. Use your vote and your donations to throw every one of them out of office.     </p>

			<p>Stopping illegal immigration is a dire need, certainly.  But putting a halt to ALL immigration for a period is what is really needed.  The reason is that it is impossible for so many immigrants to assimilate into America.  Of course, it is not really the desire of our current (past 30 years anyway) immigrants to assimilate anyway.  Most of them simply wish to extend their national territory to a section of the U.S.</p>
<p>After WW1, there was a slowing and then halt to immigration.  This allowed the mostly white European (yes, those Jews were white Europeans) to become Americans.  Or course, in most cases they very much wanted to become Americans.  It was this period of Americanization that allowed the U.S. to unite and fight to victory in WW2.  Now, the only people that seem to be volunteering for the services are overwhelmingly rural whites.  Most of our major cities have &#8220;no go zones,&#8221; for whites, etc., and some of our best regions are being turned into areas too dangerous to travel.  Mexico is now too dangerous for any but the foolhardy to vacation in.</p>
<p>But many Amren posters only see the liberal aspect of the problem.  The problem is the corporations and banks, and many construction companies (usually owned by white, christian men) conservatives all - who put immediate profit ahead of the survival of the real American populations - the middle classes - in the long term.  </p>
<p>I am glad to hear at least one Republican candidate who seems to understand this.  The Democrats are functionally pandering to &#8220;minority groups.&#8221;  When there is no longer a white majority, it will at least be entertaining to see how they leverage themselves against &hellip;&hellip;.. what?  The so called minorties will have to grow up at last. </p>

			<p>On the morning radio in Houston today, I heard a report about the gov.t of Sonora county, Mexico who are complaining to the US about the huge numbers of Mexican citizens who are returning to Sonora with very little money or prospects of employment, and bringing their wives and children back with them. Oh the horror.<br>
 Sonora is concerned about all these Mexicans coming to Mexico, how my heart bleeds!.<br>
 What a crock!<br>
