						<p>The Lincoln Review, a Washington-based black think tank, published an article titled &#8220;What Does the Future Hold for Historically Black Colleges?&#8221; in its September/October 2007 edition. It recalled the experiences of Bill Maxwell, a St. Petersburg Times columnist and editorial board member, when in 2004 he took a huge pay cut to teach journalism at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, Ala.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Professor Maxwell recalls his experiences in the St. Petersburg Times. The first column, &#8220;I had a dream&#8221; discusses the non-academic environment at Stillman College. His first day in his English class, Maxwell had to shout to get the class to come to order. He assigned a 500-word essay. When he read the essays, he said, &#8220;During my 18 years of previous college teaching, I had never seen such poor writing &mdash; sentence fragments, run-on sentences, misspellings, wrong words and illogical word order.&#8221; One paper read: &#8220;In my high school, prejudism were bad and people feel like nothing.&#8221; In another: &#8220;Central High kids put there nose in other people concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Professor Maxwell&rsquo;s second column, &#8220;A dream lay dying&#8221; relates more of his experiences at Stillman. He recalls, &#8220;à nothing was more appalling than the students&rsquo; disregard for college property.&#8221; He recalls the time when the Tuscaloosa Fire Department had to put out trash-can fires in King Hall, saying, &#8220;I was angry and embarrassed to see a team of white firefighters trying to save a dormitory named for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that black students had trashed.&#8221; A white firefighter asked him, &#8220;Why do they do this to their own buildings?&#8221; Touring the building, Maxwell said that even without the fire it looked like a war zone. &#8220;Holes had been kicked and punched in the walls. Windows were broken, floors were scarred and most of the furniture was damaged. The two dorms routinely underwent major repairs after each semester.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a time of gross discrimination, black colleges were crucial. Their graduates played a vital role in the unprecedented socioeconomic progress made by black Americans. Today, there&rsquo;s a question about the value of most, but not all, black colleges. According to the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, the 2005 graduation rates at black colleges ranged from a high of 77 percent at Spelman College to a low of 7 percent at the University of the District of Columbia. Only seven black colleges, out of 53 listed, had a graduation rate of higher than 50 percent. Given these numbers, the preparation and performance of students at most black colleges, one has ask whether these colleges have outlived their usefulness.</p>

					<p>I heard that most public Universities have a graduation rate of 54%. A lot of that may be minorities and the underprepared but it is still very high. Nonetheless, there rarely is property damage and a lot of the students graduate with very high marks. </p>

Only seven black colleges, out of 53 listed, had a graduation rate of higher than 50 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Graduation rates at these schools do not mean that students have successfully completed course requirements with a passing grade.  If the rate is 7%, it means that 7% of the students stayed until the completion of 4 years.  If the rate is 50%, it means the same, that 50% of the students showed up for classes most of the time over a four year period.</p>
<p>Anybody that shows up most of the time for the required time will get a degree, even though they likely will not be able to read it. </p>
<p>And when they can&rsquo;t get a job in their chosen field, because a job interview clearly reveals their inadequacies, they will blame white racism and systemic racism for &#8220;keeping the black man down.&#8221;</p>
<p>And an even more disgusting truth of the entire matter is that white liberals will agree with them.</p>

I worked at an urban middle school in the New Orleans. When I think about it, the one word that comes to mind is disgusting. These children were like caged animals. It was filthy. Students lit doors on fire, smashed desks on a daily basis, and smeared feces on the bathroom walls; just horrifying and disgusting. I quit after a year. <br><br>
Growing up in the North East, I never felt discriminated against, nor did I ever make a distinction between races. It wasn&rsquo;t until I moved south that I learned what real racism was. I get so angry when I hear ignorant white people make ignorant statements about the injustice black people endure. Obviously these white people have never had any experience in a black environment AT <span class="caps">ALL.</span> I&rsquo;m tired of catering to a race that is self destructive, ungrateful, disrespectful, has a false sense of community, and blames whites for the short comings, all the while making excuses for themselves. I&rsquo;m also tired of hearing how, as a teacher, I need to adjust my teaching style for the African American learner, especially males. The problem is that African Americans are taught to disrespect and hate whites and most teachers are white. Of course they aren&rsquo;t going to listen.<br><br>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good question to which I have never heard an answer.  For instance, why do they trash their own neighborhoods?  Why is every apartment building they occupy trashed in no time flat? <br>
I&rsquo;d really, really like to know.<br><br>
Has any black person anywhere ever offered an explanation for this phenomenom?</p>

					<p>&#8220;The problem is that African Americans are taught to disrespect and hate whites and most teachers are white.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are taught to intimidate whites, the ultimate form of oppression. They are generally well practiced at this. It&rsquo;s become an inter-generational thing. Perhaps a multi-century thing. This treatment leaves whites the hateful ones. Read what whites say. They are obsessed by blacks. They either love them or hate them (and love and hate are the same thing). A more accurate term would be to say that blacks show disdain for whites. </p>

					<p>Many blacks where I live just go to college for 1 semester so that they can join a black fraternity (they have life-long membership).  After they are initiated they just drop out of school.  It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me but that explains part of the reason why the graduation rate is so low for black colleges.</p>

					<p>I knew a black woman who graduated from an <span class="caps">HBC.</span> She was/is the stupidest person I have come in contact with. Most stupid people know they are stupid and work within the limitations they realize they have. This woman truly believed she was a genius. It was hilarious to listen to her opine about nonsense. When her stupidity was called, she would do what all blowhard blacks do, scream and act a fool and call whoever called her out&hellip;you guessed it&hellip;racist!<br>
 <br><br>
  Most educated whites know that <span class="caps">HBC </span>degrees are worth less than a high school diploma. Most employers know the type of individual that comes out of these places. If you are foolish enough to hire one of these people they will be constantly whining about perceived slights, &#8220;my chair is too hard&#8221;, &#8220;Im being disrespected&#8221;, &#8220;you wouldnt make a white employee do that&#8221; etc&hellip; If you fire them you will be paid a visit from the <span class="caps">DA&rsquo;</span>s office. <span class="caps">COUNT</span> ON <span class="caps">THAT</span>!<br><br>

					<p> The primary lesson to be learned from all of this is that Blacks cannot maintain even a modicum of civilization unless they find themselves in a society, and societal institutions dominated by whites. Blacks in majority white colleges at least conform minimally to white-i.e. &#8220;civilized&#8221;-norms, but when they lack the moderating influence of whites, they revert to form-note the behavior of Kenyans after the recent elections in Kenya, in which Kenyans roamed the streets whacking and killing other blacks belonging to different tribes with machetes, as a perfect example of what happens in black communities with no or few whites around. This is what the future holds for us and them unless demographic trends reverse dramatically in the next few years.</p>

					<p>As &#8220;Schoolteacher&#8221; noted, these schools are very useful because they keep these thugs away from majority-white schools.</p>
<p>What kills me is when blacks move into a school/housing project/neighborhood and after trashing it they then loudly demand the authorities clean up the place. They usually say something along the lines of &#8220;They never let the white folks &#8216;hood get run down like ours.&#8221; </p>

					<p>I remember an article some time ago about a scandal at Howard University (prestigous black school), seems a very small number of students graduating w/law degree could pass the bar exam, very far below the national average, I think in the single digits, the result of these findings caused some states to lower the requirements for passing.</p>

					<p>Everything went wrong for blacks when they decided to go with the ideas of radicals and agitation against the concept of slow progress through hard work. Before that, blacks were moving forward in this country. Slowly, yes, but definitely moving forward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not happening anymore. as a matter of fact, they&rsquo;re moving backward towards something worse than slavery. At least as slaves, they had value. Now, as recipients of the taxpayers dollars, they&rsquo;re nothing more than children, forever wards of the state. That&rsquo;s hwether or not they go to prison or stay &#8220;free.&#8221; It&rsquo;s all the same with them, the taxpayers are footing the bill for their existance. Somewhat like a private individual paying for their dog or cat&rsquo;s upkeep.</p>
<p>So, of course, their colleges have ceased to be relavent. It&rsquo;s the same with them, they just exist to receive tax dollars while going through this comedy of what they believe academia is.</p>

<i>A white firefighter asked him, &ldquo;Why do they do this to their own buildings?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>They do it to their buildings, their homes, their neighborhoods, and their nations. It&rsquo;s as if they&rsquo;re genetically programmed to destroy the world around them. </p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re done with the senseless destruction, they ask &#8216;why has the White man abandoned them? Why doesn&rsquo;t he give them aid and money to rebuild?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I remember an article in <span class="caps">USA</span> Today which had a picture of a black principle standing at the entrance of his black public school. They article was about how schools, black schools particulaly, were neglected and allowed to reach this stage of decay.</p>
<p>My question was how could this black principle allow this wanton destruction to be carried to this level without taking any action? Didn&rsquo;t this guy see what was going on? Are you telling me that the so-called &#8216;White&rsquo; power-structure of the public school system wouldn&rsquo;t have done anything to alleviate these problems had they been made aware?</p>

					<p>A college education today is often inferior to a junior high school education of the 1950&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>The effects of social promotion, lowered teacher credentials, and manipulative minority advantages for college entrance have decimated the quality of education in America.</p>
<p>The &#8220;college&#8221; described in the above article represents the absolute bottom created by those effects.  </p>

<p>Because when you don&rsquo;t work for and earn something, you don&rsquo;t appreciate and take care of it as much. What does it matter to them if they trash the buildings? They&rsquo;ll never have to pay for it. I&rsquo;ll bet they aren&rsquo;t even paying for their tuition. Meanwhile, my three oldest kids worked their way through college,years ago,with no federal help and my youngest is in her second year at a private college at $30,000.00 a year. You can bet my kids have never trashed a dormitory or any other piece of property, for that matter. But then again, we&rsquo;re white, hard working and civilized. Ahhh, the joys of white-skin priveledge.<br>
You get to actually work hard and pay for your own way through life. Oh yeah, all the while being taxed to death to pay for all the freeloading minorities,deadbeats that show their gratitude by hating me just for being a white,Christian, heterosexual male. Life is good.</p>

					<p> Historically black colleges and universities do not, unfortunately, keep black students away from white students at historically white colleges and universities, as poster Lothrop Stoddard suggests above, because white liberals feverishly seek out black students and lavish them with scholarships so they can attend predominantly white colleges. Because of affirmative action, most black students wind up mismatched to the institutions of higher learning they attend-a black student appropriate for state U. winds up at Harvard, for example. Who then is left to attend Historically black schools? Obviously students who have no business being in college at all. White children who are poor students, of course, have no equivalent opportunity to  obtain a college degree, and the employment options this credential commands. What type of jobs do the graduates of <span class="caps">HBCU&rsquo;</span>s get?-First, armed with a degree, they can beat private sector employers over the head with it and demand any job requiring a college degree. Failure to hire a <span class="caps">HBCU </span>grad invites a letter from the local branch of the <span class="caps">EEOC </span>threatening legal action against any company that refuses to knuckle under. Mostly, however, these grads go on to some form of government employment-most likely to teach in predominantly black school districts, where they pass on their ignorance to the next generation of blacks. Almost all blacks with doctoral level degrees have Ed.D&#8221;s-Doctor of Education-degrees. They dominate the teachers union, and of course fight mightily to assure that any pay or promotion scheme that rewards teaching excellence is voted down, because they know they wouldn&rsquo;t qualify!</p>

					<p>Kitty.. if you ask two black africans to explain &#8216;phenomenom&rsquo;, one will say he smokes it and the other will claim he injects it. Hold up a sign reading &#8216;Free Phenomenom Now&rsquo; and you will have <span class="caps">NAACP </span>demanding compensation for wrongful arrest.</p>
