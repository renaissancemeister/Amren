						<p>Federal officials are looking into an alleged immigration scam that&rsquo;s sending hundreds of Mexicans to Toronto as bogus refugees so they can earn good money working at construction sites within hours of touching down.</p>
<p>Canadian officials said large ads are being placed by unscrupulous immigration consultants in Spanish-language newspapers advising Mexicans to come here to work since the U.S. has closed its doors. Mexicans do not require a visa to travel here.</p>
<p>Officials said one ad shows the Toronto skyline and boasts that Canada is &#8220;voted the No. 1 country in the world for living four years in a row.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a fee, the Mexicans are told who to call for jobs and accommodation upon arrival as refugees at Pearson airport, immigration officials said.</p>
<p>Cosmo Mannella of Local 183 of the Labourers International Union of North America said the Mexicans take away jobs from Canadians, and pose health and safety risks on job sites because of language or other barriers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a large increase in the number of Hispanic people working in the residential sector,&#8221; Mannella said yesterday. &#8220;We need more workers but getting them this way is bad for the country and industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Union officials said most of the so-called refugees go to work for small construction or renovation firms where few questions are asked.</p>
<p>Mannella said the union has been calling for visa restrictions to be imposed on Mexico and its members met with Immigration Minister Diane Findlay last May to have the abuse stopped.</p>
<p>Immigration spokesman Karen Shadd-Evelyn said the refugee system is not meant to help people find work here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making a refugee claim is not a quick and easy way to enter the country,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The refugee system is there for those with a well-founded fear of persecution.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said only about 13% of Mexican claimants are accepted as refugees. About 5,000 Mexicans filed claims last years.</p>
<p>Her officials will be monitoring the system for possible abuse.</p>
<p>The union has signed up about 10,000 failed refugees in Toronto as members and are trying to get them status, Mannella said. He said many of the Mexicans end up getting exploited by shady contractors or undercutting others for jobs.</p>
<p>Union business agent Michael O&rsquo;Brien said there are about 70 agents who travel to job sites and check the status of workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they don&rsquo;t have papers, we stop them from working and send them home,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a huge problem and we have a lot of people coming and going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norma Kimmins of the Ontario Home Builders Association said the housing market is still strong and there&rsquo;s still a need for labour in the province.</p>

<p>So to find these guys and put an end to this, all they needed is someone who speaks spanish and who has access to a phone.</p>
<p>This SHOULD be a slam dunk but my gut tells me it&rsquo;s not.</p>

			<p>These Mexicans are all over the place!  Canada would be wise to nip this situation in the bud, or they&rsquo;ll be suffering the same fate as America in no time!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Calderon keeps saying how we must push ahead with this North American Union as it would &#8220;enhance all of our economies.&#8221;  Give me a break!  The only economy that would be &#8220;enhanced&#8221; is Mexico&rsquo;s; and of course, the rest of the continent (Canada and America) would sink.</p>
<p>Mexicans truly believe that North America should be a border-less continent, THEIR continent, and so the Mexican Invasion continues&hellip;  </p>

<p>Whatever&hellip;  Why should Canada have to pay for America&rsquo;s lax law enforcement?  Rather than wishing the invasion on Canada, why not join with Canada to STOP this invasion?  </p>
<p>Canada and America against the Mexican invasion leading to the North American Union would surely benefit all Canadians and Americans!</p>

			<p>I have not met any Mexican worker in Toronto yet.  If anyone wants to work legally in Canada, everyone needs a SIN (Social Insurance Number).  I received one when I came to Canada, and the SIN is collected by the employer every time a person is hired in Canada.  And if those guys are truly illegal immigrants who came to work in Canada, then it is very obvious they do not have a legal SIN, and I predict they are either using fake SIN or their employers are not reporting to the government that they hired those workers.  It is the method used by some less than honest employers to avoid paying taxes to the government.  But that is almost always used by small-scale, independent employers, not large corporations.   Meaning, very likely the workers are using fake SIN or someone else&rsquo;s SIN.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;voted the No. 1 country in the world for living four years in a row.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>That is a lie too.  Toronto did have that recognition a few years ago, but it is no longer true.  It is currently either Stockholm, Sweden or a well-known large city in Australia which I cannot remember at top of my head now.  And some parts of downtown Toronto are quite unlivable, not even close to what you would expect from a first-world country, and there are homeless people everywhere.  If I must give one compliment to Toronto, Toronto is relatively safe.  Not because the police officers are doing their jobs, but because as long as you do obviously right things, you are guaranteed to be safe.  </p>

<p>Korean guy with a little side story:</p>
<p>I have a friend who is in the Canadian army and he told me there are a lot of guys who have a strong desire to go to Afghanistan!  I could not believe.  I asked him, why is that?  and he told me the ones who go to Afghanistan, receive 60000 dollars when they come back to Canada.  </p>

<p>I heard that he lost one eye, one hand and one leg while he was defusing a bomb in Iraq.  And from the picture, we can also see he lost a finger on his other hand.  If he was in charge of defusing bombs, then it also must have meant that he is a brilliant, very smart man.  And he looks very handsome&hellip;  a wonderful white man.  his name is Sgt. Mark Graunke.  </p>

Vitamin D tests conducted on a group of University of Toronto students have found that virtually all non-whites had insufficient levels of the sunshine vitamin, putting them at elevated risk of debilitating diseases such as osteoporosis, cancer and diabetes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s not telling us anything that we don&rsquo;t already know, so why this soft peddling response to a serious breach of our borders? I&rsquo;m aware she&rsquo;s only a mouthpiece placed up front to ward off the inevitable flak coming their way, but do try to come up with something more original than this platitudinal response.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the lead out, Immigration Minister Diane Findlay or before too long, you&rsquo;ll be replaced by <i>Juanita Mendoza-Hernandez.</i> Start imposing immediate visa restrictions for all Mexican nationals crossing the 49th parallel of latitude. </p>

<p>I live in California, near LA, where fake SSNs, driver&rsquo;s licenses, license plate tags, California ID&rsquo;s can be bought openly in the swap meets, downtown parks, on the streets in certain areas downtown.</p>
<p>Of course, the employers of these people later claim the &#8216;couldn&rsquo;t tell the ID was a fake&rsquo; as they hire illegal Mexicans at a fraction of the rate a legal Californian would demand.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard many dry wallers (for example)on the local radio station lamenting the fact that construction workers who used to earn $17/hour 20 years ago are now competing with illegal Mexicans willing to work for $9/hour  &mdash;  cash only, of course, much of which is sent straight to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is estimated now that 40% of the economy in Los Angeles is cash based.</p>
<p>Of course, Mexicans, legal or illegal are able to freely access California&rsquo;s emegency rooms, schools, welfare system at HUGE expense to California&rsquo;s taxpayers.  Is it any wonder the tax base and businesses are fleeing the state under crushing taxes and regulations (with more to come)?</p>
<p>We have been politically taken over by Mexican socialists who are demanding universal health care for all  &mdash;  legal or illegal (fully supported by our idiot governor)  &mdash;  all the while we are 14 billion dollars in debt, with a lot more to come. The economy here is collapsing around us with the governor recommending that 20% of our beaches and parks be closed to the public.</p>
<p>Of course, the elephant in the room is NEVER discussed in the state house  &mdash;  illegal (and legal) immigrants who are destroying California.</p>
<p>I believe Whites in California will eventually suffer the same fate as Whites in Zimbabwe and SA  &mdash;  we will be killed and our land re-distributed. I read this site (http://www.southafricasucks.blogspot.com/) often and see many similarities in our fates  &mdash;  in 20 years, we will be where <br>
SA is right now. </p>
<p>Those who did this to our once-beautiful, once-prosperous state should be hunted down with dogs and hanged from lampposts (I can so dream).</p>
<p>Toronto:  This will be your fate as well as your socialist government welcomes unfettered immigration from un-skilled, un-educated, welfare-draining leeches who will eventually out-breed you with their large families and overwhelm you politically and economically  &mdash;  all the while screaming &#8216;racist&rsquo; at you.</p>
<p>It is too late for us, I believe California is too far gone at this point.  Good luck, my Candian friends, you&rsquo;re going to need it.</p>

			<p>The only reason this recieved ANY attention at all was because the Mexicans were brought into Canada by a private firm.</p>
<p>The Goverment places ads very similar to the one described above in almost every third world hellhole you can care to mention&hellip;maybe the goverment is slightly annoyed that their methods were being imitated by the private sector (lol- irony there)and muscling in on their turf&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also ironic to note that the head of a union  &mdash;  -which is  ALWAYS in favor of race replacing whites on general principal (in the deluded idea that this will mean more of the lumpen proletariat to fill their ranks-and, as a bonus, non white ones)is complaining.</p>
<p>Anyway- one a &#8220;refugee&#8221; is here and makes a claim for status, it is YEARS before their case will even be examined. Anhd by then many of these Mexicans will have dissapeared from the radar. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m no Kennedy fan either, but wouldn&rsquo;t it serve better to leave those sorts to the natural process?  The fruits of their treachery will surely be sour in their belly someday. May they live long.</p>
<p>In the meantime, rather than shooting at the hole in the boat in anger, we should patch the hole!  And bail the boat.  </p>

			<p>Some people is crying for the california &#8220;invasion&#8221; and even compare it with south africa, both places belonged to africans and mexicans and was the english that invaded that places, California, los angeles, those are even spanish names, you took california away from mexicans they are just doing the same you did to them as well as new mexico texas arizona, etc.<br>
I wonder how the first nation canadian natives felt when europeans started to take out their lands and left them a small reservoirs in what was their land.<br>
In vancouver as example 90% of the homeless are white, in a place where almost 50% are asians! is hard to find a homeless asian or latino, same in US, most of the bums are white, that means the immigrants are working.<br>
Why dont you all go back to france and england then? cos you emigrate and settle here, people all over the world emigrate always, its a natural human behavior, stop beign racist, or at least know a mexican first hand (many canadians talk without first hand knowledge, fear to the unknow is natural) and youll see most of them are good people that just wanna work.<br>
Also, canada and US are leeching many natural resources from mexico and now are aiming for the oil, make big money in the export market, etc. but people dont know that.<br>
A bit of knowledge and understanding the whole and real situation wont hurt.<br>
Im not saying the situation is good, mexican immigration should be controled in a win win situation, but most of the post i see are plain racist and not well founded.</p>
