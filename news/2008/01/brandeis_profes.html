<p>Politics professor Donald Hindley, who has taught at the Waltham school for 47 years, had a monitor placed in his classroom and was asked to undergo sensitivity training after he told students in his Latin American politics class last semester that Mexican migrants are sometimes referred to pejoratively as &#8220;wetbacks,&#8221; according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which is aiding his case.</p>
<p>A student complained to the administration, according to the foundation, which in October found that Hindley had made &#8220;statements in class that were inappropriate, racial, and discriminatory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hindley also received a letter from Provost Marty Krauss in which he was threatened with termination and told a monitor would observe his classes until Krauss determined he was &#8220;able to conduct (himself) appropriately in the classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education claims that Hindley&rsquo;s free speech rights were violated and his academic freedom was encroached.</p>
<p>Hindley, when reached at his office Thursday, claims he was never told the nature of the complaint against him and was never given the chance to defend himself. But according to the foundation, he told the class that Mexican immigrants are sometimes pejoratively referred to as &#8220;wetbacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been persecuted for some years because I am outspoken .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and this is vindictive persecution for my outspokenness,&#8221; [Hindley] said before refusing to comment further and referring questions to his lawyer.</p>
<p>His lawyer, Andrew Good, said Hindley was not allowed to appeal the provost&rsquo;s decision and has so far refused to attend sensitivity training. He received a letter from the university on Jan. 7 declaring the matter closed.</p>
<p>The university refused comment on the details of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;The university feels that this is a personnel and private matter and above all else the university is obligated is to protect the confidentiality of the individuals involved in this case,&#8221; spokesman Dennis Nealon said.</p>
<p>Calls to Krauss and President Jehuda Reinharz were not returned on Thursday.</p>

No one should  have to stand for abuse.  Youre right about that.  But that aside,  i think that what 1:o9PM was trying to say was that the work place is not the right place for discussions about race - not even for harmless jokes.  Someone is always likely to take some word the wrong way. This article isn&rsquo;t about abuse. Even the Brandies professor wasn&rsquo;t being abusive, he was just using a very minor term in a harmless way. Or so he thought, to his regret.</p>

					<p>It is because whites will not stand up for themselves, their sons and daughters, their country, their culture, their history that non-whites and marxist liberals get away with what they do. No matter where I am, at work or any other place, if anyone, non-white or white, starts denegrating white people or culture, I am right down their throats. I for one will not back down or allow myself, my children, or my culture be pushed around without answering back. Get a backbone, white race!!! The only reason all this marxist garbage is going on is because we as individuals let it happen. How are we to be respected if we won&rsquo;t even respect ourselves and defend who and what we are? Wake up!!!</p>

					<p><b>I can&rsquo;t wait for the day when you can go to jail for saying: &#8220;In Latin American countries many of the natives speak Spanish.&#8221;</b><br>
Posted by R we Nutts <br><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br><br>
Crazy as it sounds, the above is really coming to be true   &mdash;   more or less. Some would object to being called &#8220;Latin&#8221;.   Mexicans dislike the word &#8220;Spanish&#8221;.  Many would find the word &#8220;native&#8221; to be highly offensive.  Others could object that &#8220;America&#8221; is a name imposed on them by Europeans, hence invalid.   Under the rules of the game as presently played, whites can&rsquo;t win!</p>
<p>In my job, I have one firm rule:  I <span class="caps">NEVER </span>discuss or even comment on any racial, religious or ethnic topics <i><b>whatsoever!  </b></i> Others around me may tease and tell little jokes   &mdash;   just playful little friendly jokes that are harmless.  For instance: &#8220;That&rsquo;s right. Us white guys can&rsquo;t do anything right, can we? Leave it to a white guy to mess up. Only a black guy can do it right.&#8221;   I remain silent. I don&rsquo;t comment.  There is always going to be  some thin-skinned, hypersensitive person who will take it the wrong  way and complain. They&rsquo;ll say it was really sly sarcasm aimed back at them. You never know.  I treat <span class="caps">THE ENTIRE SUBJECT</span> AS <span class="caps">BEYOND THE PALE.</span></p>
<p>The other day, the topic of black reparations came up.  All the blacks thought it was a great idea and they were all for it (naturally!!!).  One white guy said slavery is all ancient history and they should just  &#8220;Get over it&#8221;. For a moment, I thought there was going to be a race war. I got out of the room!   I didn&rsquo;t even want to be there to be named in anybody&rsquo;s complaint - not even as a witness. Even though I said nothing, I could have been blamed for not speaking up in their behalf and reprimanding him. You just can&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>Rule for whites:  When on the job, DO <span class="caps">NOT DISCUSS RACE</span>!  In any form.  Do not comment, do not even mention it, or acknowledge it, or use any sort of  race-related terminology. Just say nothing!   Have no opinion! </p>
<p>This is the ridiculous situation that exists today which we have to live in.  Race has become our national obsession and mental illness.  Don&rsquo;t fall into the quicksand!  Steer clear of the entire subject. It&rsquo;s poison.</p>

(As with a poster above, the daughter of the School Boards&rsquo; president got a bad grade.)</p>
<p>And what is &#8220;Donald Hindley&#8221; doing teaching at Brandeis anyway?  Served him right.<br>
After 47 years teaching there, he should know by now what kind of place he&rsquo;s in, what&rsquo;s allowable and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>

have come home to roost. Was not Justice Brandeis one of the<br><br>
Justices who helped get us into this mess? Did he not use any and<br><br>
all means, both fair and foul, to push civil rights legislation<br><br>
on a hapless White America? These people never appreciated us or<br><br>
what we they could have shared with us. As their blind Samsons<br><br>
push over the pillars of our society, the Roof shall Fall on them<br><br>

					<p>It seems another person with Brandeis connections said something provocative but was allowed to slide. This may be old news to some but it&rsquo;s more than relevant now:</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists. Make no mistake about it, we intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as &lsquo;the white race&rsquo; is destroyed - not &lsquo;deconstructed&rsquo; but destroyed.&#8221;   &mdash;   Noel Ignatiev September of 2002</p>

					<p>I am a high school Spanish teacher in Colorado. One day one of my students made a crack about &#8220;Dirty Mexicans.&#8221; I said &#8220;Did you say &#8220;Dirty Mexicans? That is unacceptable.&#8221; There was another teacher in the room that heard the whole thing and was willing to verify exactly what was said.</p>
<p>Administration told me that I would not be back the next year because I said &#8220;Dirty Mexicans&#8221; in class. I think that they actually had an ulterior motive though, I had also given the daughter of the President of the School Board a bad grade.</p>
<p>It is truly amazing that no matter what the context, there are certain words that even if innocently uttered can get you fired.</p>

					<p>Beware! There are big gaping  traps set for all White Christians. There are words that certain people recite regularly. They use the words any way they want. They shout the words whenever a White is nearby. They will never be punished  for it, because they are not White Christians. <br>
The trap is that <span class="caps">YOU </span>can not say the words, or the strong arm of the marxists comes down hard on you. You can&rsquo;t even quote the words. You can&rsquo;t even <span class="caps">CONDEMN </span>the words - because you then said the word and you are a White Christian and you are damned.<br><br>

					<p>This is typical of the Stalinist mentality that has been oozing through the universities for decades like some kind of toxic sludge. The Soviets used political commissars to sniff out and punish ideological deviation. Now we have &#8220;monitors&#8221; placed in classrooms and compulsory &#8220;sensitivity training&#8221; which I believe is actually a form of punishment and aversion-based operant conditioning. The Soviets conducted secret trials based on the testimony of anonymous informers. Professor Hindley &#8220;was never told the nature of the complaint against him and was never given the chance to defend himself.&#8221; This is literally Kafkaesque. In The Trial, Josef K is arrested for no apparent reason and spends the rest of the novel wandering through a bureaucratic maze, trying to find out what the charges are. Like Josef K, Professor Hindley &#8220;wasn&rsquo;t allowed to appeal the provost&rsquo;s decision.&#8221; Secret charges. No appeal. Mandatory behavior modification programs under threat of dismissal. This kind of thing seems so normal today that we tend to forget how really insidious it is. How long before the Marxists in charge of the Liberal Arts departments start using the Ludovico Technique to &#8220;cure&#8221; political deviation by hapless professors who were denounced by one of their students for inadvertently using a banned word? (See A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess for a description of the Ludovico Technique). The invasion of the universities by the Social Marxists started back in the Sixties (for a good description of how it worked in a particular department, see &#8220;The Sydney Philosophy Disturbances&#8221; at https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/sydq.html. This is basically the story of how David Stove, one of the centuries great philosophers, tried to fight the encroachment). Argument has never been useful in fighting this toxic ideology and law suits don&rsquo;t even seem to do the trick. Active resistance is going to be required. Whites have got to fight back. Hard. That&rsquo;s all there is to it.</p>
