						<p>It would have been a new low in Fire Department race relations: the apparent mock lynching of a stuffed toy monkey in a city engine house last month.</p>
<p>Black firefighters called it a &#8220;terrible act of hate.&#8221; Racial tension in the department flared. City Hall requested a federal investigation.</p>
<p>After a two-week inquiry, the FBI concluded that happenstance, not hate, was the leading factor. The monkey, retrieved from a fire scene, had been draped from a coat rack to dry. The noose was actually an equipment strap around its neck. No racial bias was involved, the agency said.</p>
<p>Even so, the incident came amid an increase in noose complaints nationwide, possibly a reaction to the use of a noose in the &#8220;Jena 6&#8221; case in Louisiana. Missouri and other states are now considering legislation that targets the hangman&rsquo;s noose.</p>
<p>But, experts say, such measures can be difficult to enforce and, as the firehouse episode demonstrates, fraught with ambiguities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Potok says the noose, which is seen as an icon of racially-based lynching, has replaced the burning cross as the dominant symbol of racial intimidation in the nation.</p>
<p>The image has even worked its way into the world of golf: A television commentator&rsquo;s remark that Tiger Woods&rsquo; competitors may want to &#8220;lynch&#8221; him led Golfweek magazine to put a noose on the cover of its current issue.</p>
<p>LINKS TO &lsquo;JENA 6&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <a href="/news/2007/06/report_says_kkk.html#splc" target="splc_does_not_check_for_accuracy">Southern Poverty Law Center,</a> which tracks hate crimes nationwide, finds fewer than a dozen noose reports in a typical year. But in the last four months, the center says, there have been between 60 and 70, including incidents at a Home Depot in New Jersey, a factory in Houston and at Columbia University in New York, where a noose was found hanging on the door of an African-American professor&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Many trace the increase to events in Jena, La., where a noose display preceded the beating of a white student by black classmates. The incident led to criminal cases against six black students, which touched off a national outcry.</p>
<p>Though the local U.S. attorney has since said that the noose was not directly related to the altercation, there are calls for the passage of anti-noose laws.</p>
<p>Some, such as Potok, question whether those measures, which hinge on intangibles such as context and intent, can be effective. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe for a second that hate crime penalty enhancement laws have reduced hate crime,&#8221; Potok said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When the toy monkey was discovered, black city firefighters said they did not care that there was no actual rope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it&rsquo;s a rope or a shoe string, it&rsquo;s a noose around the neck of a monkey,&#8221; said Abe Pruitt, a vice chair of the black firefighters&rsquo; group.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The FBI also looked into a later incident at an engine house across town &mdash; where a box of crackers was hung by a cord &mdash; but dismissed it as a prank between two minority firefighters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jeannine Bell, a law professor at Indiana University who has written extensively about hate crimes, says motivation is the key.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t have a hate crime just because the victim sees something,&#8221; Bell said. &#8220;You look to the perpetrator&rsquo;s motivation.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why does anyone on this planet care what blacks like or do not like?&#8221;<br>
Posted by Pree <br>
- - - - - - - -<br>
Why?  Because they riot and loot and burn, like  spoiled three-year-olds having a tantrum. And then the politicans (and those business and real estate interests who own them) are shivering and wetting their pants. </p>
<p>And furthermore, blacks have learned, from experience, that this works. If blacks had nicer manners, no one would care.<br>
