						<p>A suburban Chicago man is accused of setting an apartment fire &mdash; killing his pregnant daughter, her husband and their young child &mdash; because the son-in-law didn&rsquo;t ask permission for the marriage, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Subhash Chander, 57, of Oak Forest, Illinois, was ordered held without bond Tuesday on three counts of first-degree murder, one count of intentional homicide of an unborn child and one count of aggravated arson.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege Chander used gasoline to start the fire late Saturday. The India native told police he disliked his son-in-law because he belonged to a lower caste and had married his daughter without his consent, said Cook County First Assistant State&rsquo;s Attorney Robert Milan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Chander&rsquo;s sister, Kamla Devi, told WBBM-AM that her brother is innocent. She said that relatives approved of the marriage and that the caste system was not a consideration for her family in India, nor is it a consideration now in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Devi told the radio station that the family is from Chandigarh in northern India.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Milan identified the victims as 22-year-old Monika Rani, her 36-year-old husband, Rajesh Kumar, and their 3-year-old son, Vansh. Rani was five months pregnant, Milan said.</p>

					<p>&#8220;The India native told police he disliked his son-in-law because he belonged to a lower caste and had married his daughter without his consent, said Cook County First Assistant State&rsquo;s Attorney Robert Milan.&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;She said that relatives approved of the marriage and that the caste system was not a consideration for her family in India, nor is it a consideration now in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>So his sister denies what he himself claims.  I strongly suspect he can discern his own biases and motives better than another.</p>
<p>One wonders is she didn&rsquo;t feel compelled to dismiss the &#8220;caste&#8221; motive in this horrific murder due to fear of a backlash and loss of her immigration status (whatever <span class="caps">THAT </span>might be).  No need to worry, Sis&hellip; We have already established that there is no crime so heinous to merit anyone&rsquo;s removal or generate a public outcry for changes in immigration policy.   </p>

					<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal? These are just decent, honest Indian expatriates coming here to do jobs, at <span class="caps">LOWER WAGES </span>than Americans would take.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t Indians have the legal and moral right to practice <span class="caps">THEIR </span>beliefs without a bunch of racist Americans complaining about a honor killing or two? Besides, back in Bangalore, this is every-day stuff that doesn&rsquo;t even cause an eyebrow to be lifted.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GET USED</span> TO <span class="caps">IT, AMERICA.</span> . .  India also has a well-deserved reputation as the Rape Capital of the World.

					<p>Pretty common values among this group.  </p>
<p>In Ottawa, Canada, an Indian man killed his wife and two daughters before Christmas, and in another celebrated case in British Columbia, one stabbed his daughter for not obeying him.  </p>

					<p>The way I understand it, the daughter was the property of Subhash Chander. Not only did Rajesh Kumar steal Chander&rsquo;s property, he had the audacity to sully the bloodline of a higher caste not once, but twice. I would suggest some type of educational program be provided to people of different cultures who make their way to the United States. They need to know that the United States will violate a man&rsquo;s property rights and even put them in prison.</p>

					<p>Please remember that India was one of the first on the list of countries condemning South Africa over apartheid, a system which was working, albeit not perfectly. There is not supposed to be a caste system now in india as all are equal under the law following much international pressure. Notwithstanding this &#8216;law&rsquo; it will take a lot of &#8216;influence&rsquo; and at least ten years to bring a case to court. Guess which castes provides the Magistrates and Police. Meanwhile, don&rsquo;t draw water from the village well if you are low caste and don&rsquo;t expect me to draw it for you as I am not a servant. I note that the prosecution in this case failed to include a charge of committing a racist hate crime in spite of the confession to police that it was indeed so.</p>

					<p>Another one of the model minority showed his true colours. I dont know how much longer we are going to fall for the drivel of the zombies that honor killings have nothing to do with arranged marriages. If all the women disobeyed their arranged marriages only then we would see the violence explode from their highly spiritual, peacefull and highly educated indians.</p>

<p>this is exactly the answer I expect from the likes of you. nothing new here. denial, hypocrisy and delusions as usual. according to <span class="caps">AIDWA </span>there is aprox. 5000 dowry and honor related murders ever year in india. it is about 17 murders of women every single day! it has become such a routine that the only way is simply not to take notice and go on deluding oneself and others  that you are by large law abiding and creative people. even if the ugly reality is screaming in our faces. how typical indian! in canada and UK there is estimated few hundred honor and dowry killings everyyear commited by law abiding indians.</p>
<p> British Columbia&rsquo;s Attorney-General Wally Oppal called spousal violence a &lsquo;cancer&rsquo; in the Indo-Canadian community. &ldquo;Spousal violence is an issue of the community at large. But it&rsquo;s more acute in the South Asian community,&rdquo; Mr. Oppal said</p>
<p>but indians go on spouting such incredible rubbish about their law abidance and civility ad nauseam.probably because these words carry completely diferent meaning with them.  </p>

<p>I believe &#8216;honor killings&rsquo; would be more common in the Indian muslim community but Indians in general do not treat women very well. The burning of widows, killing of daughter-in-laws for dowry, and killing girl babies. It really isn&rsquo;t very far out from those &#8216;honorable&rsquo; traditions.<br>

					<p>Indians still commit less crimes per capita than whites do.  We also have higher income per capita.  basically you are just taking hand picked stories of indians killing their families and saying that importing indians is bad for a country in general.</p>
<p>btw, the best way for a culture to last is for the population to remain high.  the only way for a population to remain high is to &#8220;control&#8221; women and make sure they marry young and have manny kids.    This is why the white population was healthy before feminism.</p>
<p>Now you could continue posting stories about &#8220;backward&#8221; south asians and say &#8220;look at these third world people and their primative culture&#8221; or you could realise that although indians do controle their daughters, indians have a much higher population that whites do, and that high population is <span class="caps">BECAUSE </span>of our culture.</p>
<p>and the reason that parents control who their daughters marry is because it prevents them from running off with the &#8220;bad boy&#8221; types and getting screwed in the end.  That is common with white women, is it not?</p>

<p>Yes, but you must understand that it is <span class="caps">BECAUSE </span>of your tremendously high population India is at great risk of devastating internal conflict. Water and food wars will eventually hit both India and China. </p>
<p>Both countries are now in the initial stages of feeling the impact of their dwindling resources.  This is not an opinion; it is a known fact, and there is little being done about it.  In some parts of both countries the water resources are unfit for drinking.  It will get far worse.  </p>
<p>The populations will split into warring factions like Somalia with war lords governing certain areas, while other renegade gangs roam throughout the countryside and what are left of the urban areas, getting whatever they can with AK 47&rsquo;s.  Hundreds of millions will starve; tens of millions will succumb to diseases brought about by unsanitary conditions and inadequate diets.  Literally millions more will be shot en masse, because they represent a rival group or they constitute a threat to one group or another&rsquo;s food or water supply.  The large populations of India and China will be their downfalls.</p>
<p>It is the countries that limit their populations and become mostly self-sufficient that will make it through the 21st century without imploding.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the West is going in the opposite direction, because of greed and are importing tax and consumer units to further line the pockets of the corrupt elite without a thought of the dangers facing an over-populated nation or an out-of-control multicultural one, so you might well have jumped from the frying pan into the fire when you emigrated here.</p>
<p>Small pockets of American communities will survive the coming civil upheaval if they are fortunate enough to be able to escape to covenant communities in well supplied wilderness areas, and although we will see an ethnically divided nation, it will be as a picnic compared to the devastation in store for China and India.</p>
<p>No threat is so great for humanity than over population.  Absolutely <span class="caps">NONE.</span></p>

<p>17 murders a day related to honor and dowry, you left it out somehow. other crimes and murders are much higher and that is only official numbers.with india as one of the most corrupt countries in the world the official number has to be multiplied many times to get the real picture as in any other third world country. not to mention 20 million girls killed in 10 years and many thousands young women simply dissapearing every year without trace. give me the name of any country with such appaling record of brutality.</p>

<p>&#8220;17 murders a day related to honor and dowry, you left it out somehow.&#8221;<br>
the main point you guys are making is that the culture of indians is worse than that of the west.  obviously i would only take into account the differnece in crime our culture causes, not crimes that are common to both cultures.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;(a bunch of vague statements)&hellip;give me the name of any country with such appaling record of brutality.&#8221;<br>
i am guessing that muslims inflate those statistics, but let me ask you something. can you give me the name of any culture other than the west where birthrate is below replacement levels?</p>
<p>at 8:18 AM on January 4<br>
&#8220;it is simply impossible to come to any understanding with them.common sense and dialog doesnt work here&#8221;<br><br>
for the record: i was born in canada, i have nothing in common with the indian culture, i am 100% assimalated, i can&rsquo;t read or write in my native language, etc&hellip;  I am not arguing that india is better than the west, i am arguing that indians are productive immigrants and traditional cultures are better than non traditioinal cultures.  this is because traditional cultures are set up so that birthrate remains high. i mean, only recently did the western culture have soo many divorces, career women, and lack of babies.</p>
<p>Posted by Robert Kelly at 10:17 AM on January 4<br>
&#8220;Here&rsquo;s some data in support of the above contention regarding food and water:&#8221;<br><br>
I am very skeptical that this will be a catestrophic problem.  but i will give you the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>ok so you guys are arguing for low birthrate, and i am saying that the more babies the better.</p>
<p>so india has a huge population and apperently dwindling recources and the west has a low population but are being invaded by people from clutures where the birthrate is high.   Lets see in 100 years, who is in better shape&hellip;my money is on asia.</p>
<p>and one more thing, if not south (nonmuslim) and east asians as immigrants, who do you want to come to western countries?<br>

					<p>&#8220;this mad max like situation you predict for india and china is compleatly wrong. From what i have read, india and china have the fastest growing economies.&#8221; Posted by Ronak at 12:56 AM on January 4</p>
<p>Ranger:  &#8220;Fastest growing economies?&#8221;  Pray tell what good that will do if they are reduced to fighting over food and water?  The simple fact is that report after report has been released in large numbers by experts who track natural resources and they verify that India and China are in great danger of being unable to feed their people and have enough water to drink, and many geographical areas throughout the world are in the same fix.  The above link by a poster is just one wee voice out of hundreds or thousands saying basically the same.<br>
<a href="https://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=213343" rel="nofollow">https://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=213343</a><br><br>
Here&rsquo;s another:<br><br>
<a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article1539703.ece" rel="nofollow">https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article1539703.ece</a></p>
<p>I could cite at least two dozen more.</p>
<p>Overpopulation and dwindling resources are going to be the basis for wars in the 21st century throughout the world.  In addition to that, the entire West will implode from multiculturalism,  <span class="caps">BEFORE </span>our resources reach critical mass, but it will be India and China that will suffer the greatest from their inability to feed and provide water for their teeming masses. </p>
<p>Ronak:  &#8220;also, too high of a birthrate is <span class="caps">ALWAYS </span>better than too low of one. it prevents your country from, you know&hellip;..getting taken over and stuff&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ranger:  What good do tens of millions of armed troops do against a country that can wipe them off the map with nuclear weapons and high tecnology?  And what good does having millions do if they can&rsquo;t be fed and provided with water?</p>
<p>Bottom line is that the world of the future belongs to the nations that are militarily advanced with well-armed, high tech weapons and stable populations.</p>

					<p>Anon: &#8220;so india has a huge population and apperently dwindling recources and the west has a low population but are being invaded by people from clutures where the birthrate is high. Lets see in 100 years, who is in better shape&hellip;my money is on asia.&#8221; Posted by at 4:51 PM on January 4 </p>
<p>ranger (Rkelly): The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>has a multicultural population that is on the brink of imploding in the next few years, depending on the economic factor, so India and China are better off in that respect, but both countries will be having huge water and food wars <span class="caps">AFTER </span>the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>has once again stabalized its population into various racial enclaves, with whites securing a huge portion of the country, mostly in the North.</p>
<p>In 100 years it is likely that India and China will be almost completely destroyed, because of internal conflicts, so they would not pose a serious military threat to the <span class="caps">US.</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">ANON</span>:  &#8220;and one more thing, if not south (nonmuslim) and east asians as immigrants, who do you want to come to western countries?&#8221;  Posted by at 4:51 PM on January 4 </p>
<p>ranger(Rkelly): I have no quarrel with having low numbers of Indians who can contribute to the <span class="caps">US. </span> There are a few Indians in my present area and I get on with them very well.  They&rsquo;re very friendly.  But I&rsquo;m afraid there will be no multiculturalism in the US after it has its next civil war.</p>
<p>No extremely pluralistic society in the history of the world has avoided breaking up, and since the US is more &#8220;diverse&#8221; than any other nation in history its separation along lines of race and ethnicity is assured.</p>

             I love your posts, but afraid I must take issue with you.<br><br>
I confindently predict that the Indian race will still be here in 100 years&rsquo; time, thriving, massive and totalling in the billions.<br><br>
Only they won&rsquo;t all be in India - a good billion or two will be resident in north America and Europe.<br><br>
As for the White race - well that&rsquo;s for the birds.</p>
<p>At bottom, is the question of political leadership, as always.</p>

					<p>Indian communities are among the largest contributors to the clouds of ethnic enclaves in most large cities.</p>
<p>They have an affinity for isolationism that rivals the Chinese community in that they also tend to create self-sufficient economic structures within their host cities. This is easily observable by most world-class city dwellers.</p>
<p>Indians are just another group that leeches off fully established and successful societies. To state the opposite is utter nonsense.</p>
<p>To their credit, they were quite proficient as merchants in Africa (before they were kicked out), but all that proves is that Africa is a place that can be run properly&hellip; just not by Africans.</p>
<p>The whole argument here, Anoop, is that the castle system is an archaic construct so engrained into the Indian mindset that many can not escape its primitivism even if living in societies where their obsolete philosophy is completely irrelevant. <br>

india is a very diverse country.  some indians are different than others in terms of skin color and culture.  basically the caste system was set us so that people didn&rsquo;t mix too much.  how is it primitive? and how is it irrelevent in this society?</p>

					<p>To Kenelm Digby:</p>
<p>Yes, I too agree with most everything you write, Kenelm, but not this.   I think the most over-populated countries will suffer the greatest in the coming years.  Wars, starvation, and disease, I believe will decimate their populations.  The resources on this planet are limited and just can&rsquo;t provide for many more people.  I mean the contentious masses are almost at a point now where they&rsquo;re drinking rivers dry and not producing enough food to feed all the hungry mouths.  With a continuing drop in the water supply comes the inability to grow the necessary amount of food, since reduced water for irrigation means fewer crops.  Artificial irrigation is <span class="caps">EVERYTHING </span>on this planet <span class="caps">EVERYWHERE. </span> Enough food cannot be grown by rainfall alone, especially during periods of drought.  </p>
<p>And, so far as the Indian population increasing in the West, well, I adamantly believe that the West&rsquo;s multicultural societies will literally implode, and that the resulting action will be a complete purge of all non-homogeneous tribes by the remaining white populations which will be looking for white multicult necks to fit their particular brand of neckties. </p>
<p>The Indians just may have their own enclaves, but who goes in and who comes out will be strictly up to the whites surrounding them and all the other various tribes who will have their own inter-tribal conflicts before, during, and after the big one.  Their numbers could very well be reduced from conflicts with blacks and Hispanics, who will assuredly be fighting each other.</p>
<p>I think the US might have a war with Mexico in the process of all this also.</p>
<p>Let me just say that I have no desire for a doomsday scenario.  It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m absolutely convinced from all the information available to me that our future is going to be quite bad before it gets better.  And there are a <span class="caps">LOT </span>of experts who agree.</p>

					<p>Both China and India have developed within their nations, a smaller, educated, nation, that is about a fifth of the total population.  This &#8220;fortunate fifth&#8221; have plumbing and electricity, and are the creators and beneficiaries of their country&rsquo;s modern economies.  Yes, they might have food and water crises coming, but those governments will simply let the barefoot masses die if they have to.  They&rsquo;re not going to let their computer programmers and industrial technicians starve.  And, after five years of famine, if they have populations of only 3 or 4 hundred million, they will congratulate themselves on having solved most of their social problems.  India&rsquo;s Brahmins will not miss the untouchables, nor will China&rsquo;s new Mandarins cry over the peasants, any more than Mike Huckabee would mourn the loss of the White majority or WN grieve to see the Blacks and foreigners return to their native lands.</p>

					<p>&#8220;so you think putting an exclamation mark at the end of that statement of 17 killings a day makes it a big deal? ok lets seee&hellip;1,129,866,154 people in india and 17 murders a day&hellip; that makes 1.504X10^-8% of the indiand population. OH <span class="caps">THE HUMANITY</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>of course for you it is not a big deal. it is not backward and violent of indians. the women only disobeyed and got justly punished for it. no wonder indians are offended when we bring this issue up.it is us americans who are primitives and it is very barbaric of us to deny them the fundamental human right to control their daughters so they do not run off with a bad guy as one indian neatly put it here.</p>

					<p>whether huge populations of china and india survive very much depends on the generosity or stupidity of the west, when they run out of food due to population explosion, we will invent and hand over technology of genetic modification to artificialy increase the production of food in their countries, when they pollute their water sources we  will invent sewerage plants for them, if they pollute their air we will invent air cleaners for them. when they run out of drinking water we will invent desalination plants for them, when they need huge energy resources we will invent clean power plants for them etc&hellip; so my bet is on china and india </p>

					<p>&#8220;&hellip;..when they run out of drinking water we will invent desalination plants for them&hellip;.&#8221;<br>
Posted by at 7:41 AM on January 6 </p>
<p>RK:  Yes, I think you&rsquo;re right about the altruistic nature of whites to do things that usually come back to bite them.</p>
<p>Although desalination plants are a must in the Middle-East, as they have several, the US I believe is also more advanced in the desalination process, as it is in about everything else, having completed a plant on Tampa Bay recently.  I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think the plant is a dual service one operating on nuclear energy providing both electricity and using nuclear energy in the desalination process.</p>
<p>The experts have reported, however, that multiple plants still couldn&rsquo;t provide adequate amounts of water through pipelines into the interior of any country for irrigation, but could possibly have &#8220;drinking points&#8221; in the event of a worse case scenario, but that in itself would create chaotic conditions as the people fight over whatever ration they&rsquo;re alotted, if it ever came to that.</p>
<p>Too, it&rsquo;s been reported that the desalination process has much waste left over which right now is going back into the sea, and from what I&rsquo;ve learned has negatively affected marine life, so there&rsquo;s apparently a limit as to how much water a nation can produce that way.  It&rsquo;s not nuclear waste, of course, but just the heated water is supposed to act as a pollutant of sorts, probably by reducing the oxygen content.</p>
<p>Both China and India have desalination plants, but with populations so huge and countries having gigantic interiors far from the coastlines, I doubt they would benefit much by having their coastlines dotted with them.</p>
<p>This whole problem still boils down to overpopulation.  India doesn&rsquo;t seem to care, but China has stated many times in the past that without their one-child policy they will not be able to feed their masses, and they&rsquo;ve indicated that they&rsquo;ve got to see some positive developments on that in the very near future or they&rsquo;ll be in trouble very soon.  The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>in my opinion has a long way to go before we reach China&rsquo;s/India&rsquo;s situation, but our water tables are several feet below normal permanently, so I think it&rsquo;s the height of folly to keep increasing our population so the economy can expand, as the economic geeks like to say, in order to make the corporate elites wealthier.</p>
<p>Much ridicule is given to the survivalists in Idaho and other similarly remote places, by the radical left, because of what they laughingly refer to as their &#8220;bunker mentalities,&#8221; but it is they in about 100 years plus who will still be abundant in water from the snow melts in the mountains, and tillable land that will grow almost anything. </p>

					<p>China was a lot poorer under Mao than it is today, but I&rsquo;m not aware that there was much starvation. Canada sold China huge quantities of wheat, for one thing. Now that China is becoming the world&rsquo;s banker, why can&rsquo;t it purchase enough food to support its population   &mdash;   or to support, indeed, the &#8216;necessary&rsquo; elements of its population? Ditto, pretty much, for India, another rising power. Also, to what extent can desalination address the water problem?</p>
<p>Schoolteacher: I always enjoy your posts, please keep them up. I recall you writing one or more about how society would ultimately have to deal with feminism; it&rsquo;d be interesting to hear more from you on this.</p>

              I don&rsquo;t know what will happen in the medium or long term term, but this I can say for certain:The White European race is, at present, fading away before our eyes, with deaths greatly exceeding births.Virtually no European nation has a White birth-rate excedding the 2.1 childern per woman necessary to maintain a stable population - neither does the <span class="caps">USA </span>for that matter.<br><br>
On the other hand the population of India is growing massively, and shows of sign of declining, the Indians are young, strong and vigorous whilst the Whites are in general old and weak.Most ominously of all the Indian proportion of the population in the White homelands is expanding massively.<br><br>
  As any biologist involved in the &#8216;modern synthesis&rsquo; of evolutionary biology can tell you, the situation for Whites vis-a-vis Indians is dire, and has only one logical conclusion which I need not spell out.<br><br>
  Action at the political level needs to be taken <span class="caps">NOW </span>to have any effect - and there&rsquo;s absolutely no indication whatsoever that this will happen.</p>

					<p>Furthermore,<br>
             If you care to look at the stats, a non-White majority <span class="caps">USA </span>is <span class="caps">INEVITABLE </span>by 2040 at the latest - nothing we say or do will prevent this.<br><br>
  Of course, this has all sorts of implications, one of which is that a power-bloc of recent immigrants with ties to foreign countries will enact laws to remove all immigration restrictions.<br><br>
  2040 is &#8216;only&rsquo; 32 years away, the same time in the future as Jimmy Carter and the Bicennential were in the past.<br><br>
   There is no serious likelihood of organised White opposition crystallizing as a political seccesionist movement by then.</p>

<p>RK:  Yes, you&rsquo;re correct on all the above, IF the situation is taken as unchangable and is followed to its logical conclusion, without any other factors involved that would have influence on the initial premise of declining white birth rates continuing on until zero is reached.  </p>
<p>But trends like this never continue on indefinitely.  Who is to say that conditions will dictate more stay at home mothers in 10-20 years and the white birth rate will sky-rocket?</p>
<p>Too, consider this, as another possible outcome regarding population figures into the future.  If every young and relatively young white couple in this country had one extra child, how much larger would the white population be next year? 10%? 20%? More?  And what if they had another the following year?  I mean we&rsquo;re talking about 20 to 40 million additional whites, if we want to speculate on suppositions as the leftist demographers are doing with their non-white population projections, because they don&rsquo;t anymore know if the present situations will continue or not.  They say what they say to intimidate whites and make them feel as if they are helpless in stopping the creation of their borderless utopia.</p>
<p>And what happens in the short term is important and must be considered, because it is the basis for what the long term ramifications will be.  For example, it makes no difference if Indians in the West have a high birth rate if the nations of the West have a severe economic drop&hellip;.as indications are at present that they will&hellip;&hellip; because it is my <span class="caps">FIRM </span>belief that we will face large scale upheavals that will tear Western societies apart, causing much decimation among all groups but mostly among non-whites, since some of them are battling now, and are on the verge of taking their conflicts to a more intense level.  Also, they&rsquo;re bound to fare badly being so badly outnumbered.  You can disagree with that, but the very real probability that it will occur looms just too large to be ignored.</p>
<p>Kenelm:  &#8220;On the other hand the population of India is growing massively, and shows no sign of declining, the Indians are young, strong and vigorous whilst the Whites are in general old and weak.Most ominously of all the Indian proportion of the population in the White homelands is expanding massively.&#8221;</p>
<p>RK:  Right again, but my contention is that they can&rsquo;t keep expanding as they have been, because they&rsquo;re depleting their resources to a critical level.  As you probably know, China has come out stating exactly that, which is why they opted for the one-child policy.  They announced just what I&rsquo;ve been pointing out:  They have to cut back on their population, because if it continues on at the rate it has been, they&rsquo;ll run out of food and water.  Since that program has been in effect, incidentally, it has been learned that resource depletion is occurring at a greater rate than they anticipated. </p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s another scenario that could be one of the variables I referred to:  Could we consider the possibility that either China or India, or both, will want a major war to occur to reduce their populations, while possibly acquiring more territory, as in Africa?  And maybe even South America?  Or how about an African and South American colony of several million each for their bulging masses, who can then harvest food for the homeland? </p>
<p>And what if these colonies in Africa and South America became so prosperous, as they likely would be, they would have a slight shortage of workers as the West is now claiming?  Undoubtedly large scale immigration would shift from the West to South America and Africa by third worlders, leaving whites in the West to once again be a great majority.  It&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>Kenelm: &#8220;As any biologist involved in the &lsquo;modern synthesis&rsquo; of evolutionary biology can tell you, the situation for Whites vis-a-vis Indians is dire, and has only one logical conclusion which I need not spell out.&#8221;</p>
<p>RK:  As a scientific exercise in cause and effect, science <span class="caps">WILL </span>agree to your premise, but again that&rsquo;s not taking any variables into consideration which, at this point, are numerous and are viable, especially the human one, to say nothing of the high probability of wars and famine.</p>
<p>Kenelm: &#8220;Action at the political level needs to be taken <span class="caps">NOW </span>to have any effect - and there&rsquo;s absolutely no indication whatsoever that this will happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>RK:  I agree again.  But also recognize, as you do, that it&rsquo;s not going to happen, so I&rsquo;m trying to analyze, from my experience, plus the data available from the experts, plus my own analysis and instincts, in order to determine just what all this emigration, overpopulation, and multiculturalism, will do to the West in the short term, and it&rsquo;s blaringly apparent to me that we&rsquo;re not going to escape civil upheaval that will drive us all into our own racial enclaves in each country.</p>
<p>And in a longer period of time, it looks to many of us that the overpopulation of India and China will mean large scale conflict for them as well.</p>
<p>As &#8220;Schoolteacher&#8221; said above: (Referring to China) &ldquo;And, after five years of famine, if they have populations of only 3 or 4 hundred million, they will congratulate themselves on having solved most of their social problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I also agree with that, but can you imagine the utter chaos and turmoil that will transpire from start to finish?  It&rsquo;s bound to weaken them and hammer them into having a non-aggression policy, I don&rsquo;t care who they save.  The same is true with India who I believe will be affected even worse, because they&rsquo;re so non-chalant about the whole affair they aren&rsquo;t even giving the possibility of famine or overpopulation a second thought.</p>
<p>How much simpler and easier it would be to just have smaller populations worldwide, creating sustainable societies that could carry on for another thousand years without worrying about going through a period of war, disease, and famine, in order to reach the same objective. </p>

					<p>The third-world has always striven to outbreed the industrialized world, so none of this information is new nor is it cause for alarm.  And since the government generates the birthrate statistics I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t believe them since the half-truth and the lie are the favorite tools of statecraft.  Western people&rsquo;s population levels have always been dynamic and in sync with the economy, because whites are intelligent enough to not have more children than they can afford.  Third-worlders, on the other hand, have always bred irresponsibly and their self-induced overpopulation is the primary reason they are impoverished&hellip;               </p>

             The problem is essentially mathematical being a symptom of that mathematical concept the &#8216;dynamic equilibrium&rsquo;.Basically this means the population dynamics <strong>appear</strong> to the casual observer at any specific time and place to be &#8216;stable&rsquo;, but in reality the situation is changing in a definite direction with a definite velocity.<br><br>
Ergo, ever year approximately 1/75 of a &#8216;stable&rsquo; population dies and 1/75 is born.<br><br>
But what we are seeing today is an acute shift in the dynamic in which the balance is being shifted inexorably into the non-White population.<br><br>
Yes, I am aware trends can change, but we have two things to contend with.<br><br>
1/. Living space - no self-defined population group cannot exist without a definite living-space, White living-space is being ceded over - See Frank Salter and &#8216;ethnic genetic interests&rsquo;.<br><br>
2/. The trendtowards small families appears irreversible, driven as it is by high costs (eg education, housing), which acts as a rational break on child-bearing to respectable high IQ folk.</p>

					<p>10:03 PM: The Raj was the best thing that ever happened to India.  They British built India&rsquo;s infrastructure, the railroads, the telegraph and phone lines, the roads.  They left India with a functioning government and civil service.  Without the British presence, India would look like Brazil.  India&rsquo;s problem is the caste system, that says that the son of a brickmaker with an IQ of 140 must be a brickmaker too, and that the dull-minded son of a Brahmin goes to school.  </p>
