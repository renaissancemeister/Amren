<p>The Mexican government opened its latest Plaza Comunitaria, or Community Plaza, Thursday at San Fernando Middle School, minutes from Vidal&rsquo;s house. There are 13 such centers throughout Los Angeles County, aimed at helping Mexican nationals complete their basic education. The centers offer free classes, in person or through video and the Internet, to Mexican nationals living in the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 40% of Mexican nationals over age 25 living in the U.S. had less than a ninth-grade education, according to 2005 data compiled by the Pew Hispanic Center.</p>
<p>Consular officials said the Spanish-language classes improve immigrants&rsquo; self-esteem and enable them to help their children with schoolwork. The education in their native tongue also better prepares immigrants to learn English and encourages their assimilation. Hundreds of Mexican nationals have taken classes since the first local center opened in 2003. There are similar programs elsewhere, including San Jose and San Bernardino.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Space for the program is provided by schools and community centers, and the Mexican government supplies the textbooks. Students work at their own pace with the help of mostly volunteer teachers or tutors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>San Fernando Middle School Principal Rafael Balderas said his goal is to build a &#8220;college-going culture.&#8221;</p>

			<p>So, the Mexican government is opening Mexican schools in America, and they&rsquo;re letting Mexicans in America vote in Mexican elections.  All that remains is for such territory to change its name to Mexico.  &#8220;Where there is a Mexican, there is Mexico&#8221;   &mdash;   Vincente Fox.  &#8220;Mexico is where Mexicans are&#8221;   &mdash;   AR poster</p>

Can&rsquo;t Mexicans learn in Mexico? Shouldn&rsquo;t Mexico be concerned about their educational system? Why can Mexican learn in US territory but not on Mexican soil?</p>
<p><i>Space for the program is provided by schools and community centers, and the Mexican government supplies the textbooks.</i></p>
<p>Mexico is only supplying the text books but who exactly is paying for the schools and community centers? Is this coming out of my tax money?<br>

			<p>I think we can stop worrying about the North American Union.<br>
IT&rsquo;S HERE! Welcome to the United States of Mexico. We have all witnessed the overthrow of a superpower by a violent, corrupt third wold country with the help and support of our own government. At what point do you suppose is enough offered to make one sell out his country, his fellow citizens and his own conscience? Does thirty pieces of silver sound familiar?</p>

			<p>Interesting that Mexico has money for educating their people when they are in the US, but not for educating them when they are in Mexico.</p>
<p>This hints very strongly that the poverty in Mexico is artificial.  That they are purposefully manipulating Mexican institutions in order to encourage their citizens to immigrate to the US.  The reason seems obvious to me.  They are waging a type of warfare against us.  Move their citizens here.  Gain political power.   And use our democratic institutions to take over.  That is more than enough justifications to end all immigration from Mexico permanently.</p>

<p><br>
Teaching Mexican immigrants IN SPANISH is supposed to help them learn English? </p>
<p>Teaching Mexican immigrantss IN SPANISH is supposed to help them assimilate into America? </p>
<p>At this rate, these people will NEVER speak English OR assimilate (of course, that may be the plan). But it&rsquo;s clear that these LA Times weasels are already fluent in the language Orwell called Doublespeak. <br>

<p>Dead on. Mexico is by many estimates the tenth richest nation in the world in resources and possibly in pure financial terms. Ignorant Americans of all types who vote for those people who are enabling illegal immigration, and who use illegal labor, are falling right in line with the elites in this nation and in Mexico  &mdash;  both of whom are corrupt to the core.</p>

<p>Obscuratus,<br>
At first I assumed that you said the above for its dramatic effect, but as I thought on it more I realized that we may not have the military resources to repel such an invasion/occupation!<br>
Add to that the reality that a segment of the military is comprised of people whose loyalty to this country is dubious at best (e.g. militant Blacks, Muslims and Hispanic gang members who enlisted to get combat training so that they could more efficiently take on law enforcement) and we have a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that we&rsquo;ve been asleep at the switch for so long now that short of a nationalist, authoritarian dictatorship akin to Falangista Spain or Fascist Italy of the 30s, it may be too late to turn things around.<br>

			<p>Let me just point out to you that there are billions of dallars at stake in the cross border illegal drug trade. Nothing would enhance the profits from the drug trade more than and open border with Mexico. I beleive that there are key people in our government and financial institutions that are profiting from illicit drugs being smuggled into this country.</p>
<p>For those of you out there who think this is impossible I would refer you to Alfred W. McCoys book &#8220;The Politics of Heroin in Southeats Asia&#8221;. I read this book after I came home from Vietnam and it was an eye opener. It documents how the US government not only helped facilitate but was in fact a major player in the Southeast Asian heroin traffic.</p>
<p>Raw opium was flown out of the golden triangle on Air America aircraft to Saigon where it was processed into low grade heroin in labs controlled by the Corsican Mafia. It was then flown to France where it was processed into high grade heroin and shipped to the Uited States. Hence the name (French Connection) given to the 1960s and 70s heroin epidemic by the mainstream media.</p>
<p>I urge all of the readers of this posting to pick up this book if it is still available. It will give you an idea of just how corrupt our government really is and the amount of control exerted over it by the financial and political elites who profit from these illicit arrangements.</p>
<p>Union with Mexico will open the floodgates of the illicit drug trade evenb further allowing out political and financial elites to reap even greater profits off the misery of the citizens of the United States. If you doubt what I am saying just look what is happening in the presidential primaries. We are being told the front runners for the two major parties are Hillary Clinton and John McCain. </p>
<p>On the issues most important to the survival and properity of the United States there is no difference between these two candidates. Both Clinton and McCain are open borders, corporate globalists who will do exactly as their masters in the corpoarte boardrooms and salons of the international bankers dictate.</p>

			<p>They have sent us their best and their brightest, and they have achieved just about all that most of them can educationally. Now it is time to go work in the fields, building trades, or various illegal activities. They will not go much further.</p>

<p>I sure hope that never happens because if mighty Mexico attempted a military invasion of the US, our military, along with millions of our civilians, would literally die laughing&hellip; </p>
