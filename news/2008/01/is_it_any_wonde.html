<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In a north London suburb last week, a schoolgirl was beaten, gang-raped and then had drain-cleaning fluid poured on her body apparently to destroy DNA evidence. In the eternal cesspit of senseless urban crime, I feel that a dreadful nadir of sorts has been reached, a benchmark of slaked lust and casual, sadistic cruelty.</p>
<p>Police sources say the 16-year-old will never fully recover from the injuries caused by the caustic soda and, at the time of writing, she remains under heavy sedation in a burns unit, fighting for her life.</p>
<p>One could weep an ocean for this young woman, her life ruined by these savages, who hunted in a pack like animals and dragged her to an empty house, caring nothing for her wellbeing or future.</p>
<p>Drain cleaner? The callous premeditation is shocking, and underlines the fact that some of the rootless delinquents who roam the London streets are now scraping the bottom of the barrel of humanity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost embarrassed to say that the attackers have been described as &#8220;five black youths&#8221;, in case you think I&rsquo;m being racist in highlighting this crime.</p>
<p>Yes, these are the peculiar times we live in, particularly in a week when Trevor Phillips, the chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has pointed out that &#8220;white flight is accelerating&#8221; as Britain becomes increasingly polarised along ethnic lines.</p>
<p>Following the controversy started by the Bishop of Rochester, who said that some Muslim enclaves were &#8220;no-go areas&#8221; for Christians, it all seems to suggest a country that is becoming increasingly fragmented; a patchwork of rigidly delineated little pockets of race and religion, knots of unyielding humanity who just can&rsquo;t rub along with each other.</p>
<p>This is not a Britain many of us would care to recognise, or even want to live in, although it is true that certain sectors of the middle class are fleeing from inner London like pashmina-wrapped lemmings, desperate to escape the creeping spread of urban decay.</p>
<p>Last year, nearly a quarter of a million decent, law-abiding citizens packed their bags and left the capital for good, seeking what they hope will be a better life elsewhere. They moved to outer boroughs, other city suburbs, rural areas, abroad, the back end of beyond, anywhere but here.</p>
<p>While their fairytale, roses-around-the-door belief in the safety of the countryside and the romantic ideal of a thatched cottage for two is touching, it does point to an underlying urban unease.</p>
<p>I would rather take my chances in the city than the country, but one can hardly blame them for wanting to move.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in London this week, a medical student was stabbed to death in a row over an orange in a Brixton fruit shop. A pupil who was expelled for allegedly having a knife took his school to the High Court. And about the time most of us were sitting down to dinner, watching The Bill on television or putting the children to bed, a teenage girl underwent an unimaginable ordeal in an ordinary suburban street.</p>
<p>What is going to happen to those of us left to live here if youths across the city continue to feel quite comfortable and confident in running amok? That&rsquo;s before you even factor in the older, more professional criminal gangs from more than 25 countries, who operate prosperous drug trafficking, people smuggling, prostitution, money laundering and fraud rackets on the capital&rsquo;s streets.</p>
<p>London is a welcoming city, where home-grown and particularly international criminal networks are flourishing nicely. Somewhere in the city, a great termite nest of law-breaking and corruption grows by the day, nourished by immigrants, some of them illegal, from Algeria, Nigeria, Jamaica and Pakistan, among others.</p>
<p>Is it racist to point that out, too? I don&rsquo;t know any more. All I know is that London has room to absorb them all, particularly as so many of its citizens have recently left in a hurry. And while cosy family evenings by the fire remain one of the few benefits of a wet British winter, how alarming that fewer and fewer people feel safe doing this inside their own homes.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Last year, nearly a quarter of a million decent, law-abiding citizens packed their bags and left the capital for good, seeking what they hope will be a better life elsewhere. They moved to outer boroughs, other city suburbs, rural areas, abroad, the back end of beyond, anywhere but here.</p>
<p>While their fairytale, roses-around-the-door belief in the safety of the countryside and the romantic ideal of a thatched cottage for two is touching, it does point to an underlying urban unease.</p>
<p>I would rather take my chances in the city than the country, but one can hardly blame them for wanting to move.&#8221;</p>
<p>The writer presumes to ridicule the &#8220;romantic idea of a thatched cottage for two&#8221; which he ascribes to ONE MILLION fleeing Londoners? What sort of schizophrenic arrogance is this? How does he know what the 1 million people were thinking, and how does he reconcile being himself terrified and yet ridiculing their attempt to withdraw?</p>
<p>The real dope is as follows. Everybody knows what this means now, even the writers who have to pretend that something else is afoot. Here is a person afraid for their job and maybe even their life, sending mixed signals to pretend a crisis is not a crisis. </p>
<p>Is London safe? Is the countryside safe? Are people who move away &#8220;upright citizens&#8221; or are they &#8220;racists&#8221;? All this is so confusing, its making the poor author&rsquo;s brain boil over. </p>
<p>Everyone down to the lowest newspaper boy knows that a conquest is taking place. This person just has the official job, as a journalist, of not recognizing this reality. He is doomed to speak from four different sides of his mouth. That is the hoop he has to jump through to keep his job. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so frustrated, you don&rsquo;t even know what is up anymore and what is down. Yeah right, you know EXACTLY what is happening, this confusion is printed in the hope that it catches on amongst the somnambulist classes.</p>

<p>You know the fight is lost when someone has to ask if it&rsquo;s considered racist to complain about the evil perpetrated by non-whites and acknowledging the fact that where they go crime always follows. </p>

			<p>I guess the quote &#8220;You made your bed, now go lie in it&#8221; would appear to be appropriate here. England is getting a steady dose of what the States went through in the 1970&rsquo;s. They could&rsquo;ve heeded our warning, but no. Instead, they depicted us as a bunch of racist rednecks hell-bent on &#8220;keeping the black man down&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, being the more culturally-advanced people they THOUGHT they were, they tried the same experiment, assuming everyone would be holding hands and singing kum ba ya. I guess they&rsquo;ve found out that quite a different tune is being sung than what they had expected and are now learning the hard way that oil and vinegar naturally separate wherever and whenever they are together&hellip;a revelation that was already foretold in the States over thirty years ago&hellip;a revelation they didn&rsquo;t heed.</p>

			<p>On the one hand,understatement is one of the finer points of the English character. On the other, it is cause for much of the horror we have invited to our world. Case in point:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;it all seems to suggest a country that is becoming increasingly fragmented&#8221;<br>
I&rsquo;m sorry. It doesnt &#8216;seem to suggest&rsquo;. It STATES. Loudly. &#8216;Seems to suggest&rsquo; is a figure of speech and point of formal politeness, but it is not at all true. When truth and safety, or truth and survival intersect, all forms of politeness have to be done away with.<br>
It should be said that though other Western cultures also have similar forms of circumlocution-as-kindness, none are as deeply set or socially obligatory as that of Britain. <br>
On top of this, words and phrases we use without thought tend to pervade our thinking generally, and to a certain very real extent, govern our perceptions, our thoughts, and thereby our actions.<br>
Indirectness with the truth may be fine in a few stable social environments, but in an unstable environment where there is direct and very obvious competition for control of society (esp by outsiders), only direct and explicit truth can be the rule.</p>
<p>Those societies who are causing this menace have no such system of &#8216;politeness&rsquo; in their lexicons or modes of thought or national character. Kindness to them is read as weakness, and acted on as such.<br>
Let these facts not go unobserved.</p>

			<p>So sad to see what has happened to London. When I visited London several years ago, it was my first trip to England (as a Canadian, I know Canada and the U.S. pretty well, but not Europe). But man, was I ever disappointed! Nobody spoke English on the tube, I saw little of classic English culture, and the number of women wearing Islamic head coverings was sickening to say the least. I don&rsquo;t want to go back to London, certainly not to visit and never to live there. But I fear the third world malcontents who have ruined London will follow their white prey no matter where they flee to. And England&rsquo;s not the only developed nation in a multicultural pickle.<br>

<p>Ya, and the same can be said about white South Africans who have been vilified and made to look like devils - all for having known all these things a century or two before the rest of the world started catching on about the realities of other races in our midst.</p>

			<p>There is one missed consideration.  The rape victim was probably black too.  The National Crime Victimization Survey shows that the vast majority of crimes committed by blacks are on black victims.  This is likely the case in London too.  </p>

			<p>London will become a &#8220;non-english&#8221; city in the next 5 years.</p>
<p>I look forward to that. All of those sniffy liberals in expensive houses will see the values tumble, their daughters raped and their sons stabbed. Unless of course they are gay in which case they will have a really bad time.</p>
<p>We should build a wall around London and force them to stay and experience the &#8220;vibrancy&#8221; of the multiculturalism they forced upon us.</p>
<p>It doesnt take much imagination to see that forces are now at work that will lead to a nationalist government, very tight immigration controls and mass expulsions. </p>
<p>The dragon is stirring. </p>

<p>That modus operandi sounds familiar. </p>
<p>Oh yes&hellip;..the Channon Christian and Chris Newsom <i>black-on-white</i> torture-murders in Knoxville, TN <i>one year ago</i>, where 21 yr. old Channon was forced to watch her boyfriend being sodomized, castrated, shot, burned and dumped. She was gang-raped, urinated on, mutilated and had &ldquo;cleaning chemicals&rdquo; poured into her mouth and down her throat in an effort to destroy the physical evidence they had left behind. Her body parts were found in separate plastic bags.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t rely on the multi-cult, liberal, globalist governments to do anything in the way of solutions.  If anything is done, it will be accomplished by the citizens themselves in defiance of the multi-cult governments for simple survival.</p>
<p>Not only is the evidence of racial differences in morality and violence evident.  We have far and away enough evidence to see that governments no longer (if ever) have solutions or care to even take any actions.  Things just get worse.  They move along the very programs and agendas that caused the crisis in the first place.  They aren&rsquo;t the solution.  WE ARE.  The victims and the prey they have made of us.  Vigilantiism is supposed to be a dirty word, but what it is really is a practical result of citizens filling a vacuum left by absence of law and order, or resulting from government&rsquo;s unwillingness to provide same.</p>

			<p>Britain seems to be what the U.S. was in the 60&rsquo;s. Soft on minority criminals, forgetting the victim, blaming society, etc. Well the U.S. turned around after things got bad enough in that we went back to putting them away (after enough &#8216;minor&rsquo; convictions and they finally get to killing someone). Still, we haven&rsquo;t been wise enough to keep more of them from coming into the country but maybe that will happen eventuall, too. I think Britain will probably be a candidate for a race war sooner than the U.S. simply because of space. In the U.S., unfortunately, white people still have plenty of space to retreat. The line in the sand needed to be drawn twenty or thirty years ago but it is still a long way off.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Is it racist to point that out, too? I don&rsquo;t know any more. All I know is that London has room to absorb them all, particularly as so many of its citizens have recently left in a hurry.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes, that is how Britain has become.  People are dying from violent crime, and yet the police will charge someone for an innocuous remark, sometimes made in jest, saying that it was &#8220;racist&#8221;.  No wonder so many Brits are not only leaving London but Britain as well, now that moving to another country within the EU is so easy and often it is cheaper to live there as well.</p>
<p>I now live in Spain after 25 years spent in South Africa.  Enough said about that soon to be Zimbabwe clone, with one of the latest &#8220;I can&rsquo;t believe its&#8221; being President Mbeki trying frantically to protect his Chief of Police, Jackie Selebi (former terrorist in arms) against charges of corruption and defeating the ends of justice with some very damning evidence.</p>
<p>But here in Spain, the Spanish, while rightly being against race hate, they do not stop freedom of expression as long as it is true.  Sadly a few of the Brits have imported their racist ways of life (anti- Jared Taylor, Dr. John Watson, et al) and a prime example can be seen at www.spainvia.com/solclubban.htm.  However, the laugh is going to be on them as my report has been read by many other expats here who say that is one of the reasons they have left increasingly Orwellian Britain.</p>
<p>But while all the problems must be constantly publicised (and you have many in the USA now), I urge AmRen readers to use factual and logical ways to get their message across and keep pure hate out of their comments as that is ammunition for the Marxist controller wannabees to use against the truth-sayers.</p>
<p>The racists are those who do not recognise the facts as they conflict with their messages which in many cases have made them a lot of money and acclaim from those of like mentality.  But surely, there must be a lot of nice black people in the USA?  Are they all tarred with the same brush perhaps unfairly.  I knew a few black people in South Africa who were good people but are now victims of the new Marxists government&rsquo;s policies there.</p>

<p>Yes, of course there are certainly good black people in the USA. I&rsquo;ve certainly known some blacks who are very intelligent and nice and are victims of some the same problems. However, I don&rsquo;t think it is about hate but about anger at the behavior of so many of the  bad ones and the way the media as well as too many blacks cover for the bad ones. I do agree that when dealing with Marxists, it is a good idea to stick to facts though here people sometimes need to vent. As far as the USA having a lot of problems, MOST western countries do too these days, sadly.<br>

<p>NO IT DOES NOT! You obviously did not look at the DOJ Victimization Survey racial matrix charts for victim/offender. MOST black violent crime victims are WHITE, not black.  </p>

			<p>I keep saying it because I don&rsquo;t want the liberals to say they were never warned:  inevitably the winds of change will sweep Western civilisation with a vengeance, and we will not be content to rid ourselves of all the destructive forces let loose  by insane liberals - no, they must be punished for taking the greatest civilisation in human history to the brink, punished in a way that atones for all the crime they have unleashed, punished in a way that sends a shockwave into the future, a warning to posterity to never EVER try to do this to us again.</p>

			<p>As a white person, I must say again that the white race has an inferior gene in us.  We run.  We hide.  We don&rsquo;t have the testosterone to stand up to the illegal foreign invaders.  Britain was inhabited by our race for 500,000 years.  Tell the invaders to go home.  There needs to be mass demonstrations by the whites.  </p>

			<p> &#8220;There must be a lot of nice black people in the USA&#8221;   Quite right, Brian. <br>
What a terrible shame that 70 or 80 percent of them give the rest a bad name. </p>
<p>As I have stated in other comments, I am a native of Detroit city.  Just letting you know, so you can mull over why I come to the assessment that I do. It is not from lack of experience with the situation.</p>
<p>Remember, the statistics of criminal behavior only include those caught &amp; convicted. Are you certain we have a perfectly applied infallible system of law enforcement? Or can you believe that the damning numbers may even understate the case against the wonderful nature of our black population?</p>
<p>If researching crime statistics is too tedious, then how about a casual summary of all the utopian communities created by the nice black people in America? </p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t forget to compare &amp; contrast that to the number of communities &amp; cities that black populations have destroyed and made into &#8220;no-go&#8221; zones for anybody not wanting to become a victim of violent crime- especially whites. </p>

			<p>England, by God, must be preserved by   &mdash;   and for   &mdash;   the English!!  It is time to send those horrid Mohammedan and black hordes back whence they came.  I will not rest until these bloody rotten excuses for people leave this scepter&rsquo;d isle once and for all.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;All I know is that London has room to absorb them all&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a highly debatable statement. However, let&rsquo;s assume for the sake of argument that it is true. It then entails a question: WHY THE HELL SHOULD IT?</p>

			<p>&#8220;If the English really dislike Britain so much that they&rsquo;re willing to give it away to Pakistanis and West Indian blacks, why don&rsquo;t they give it back to the Celts, instead?&#8221;<br>

No good.  Celts don&rsquo;t qualify.  Wrong color.<br>
(More precisely,  not enough color.)</p>

			<p>I weep for the Britons as their country is invaded and defiled right under their noses&hellip;perhaps they can serve as an example to the civilized world.</p>
<p>How the mighty have fallen!</p>
