<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>It was a routine e-mail from the boss sent to congratulate a junior prosecutor in Houston, Tex., who had won manslaughter convictions against an intoxicated driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He convicted Mr. Sosa of a double intoxication manslaughter, got a weak jury to give him 12 years in each, and then convinced Judge Wallace to stack the sentences,&rdquo; Harris County assistant district attorney Mike Trent wrote in an office-wide memo. Then came the odd part: &ldquo;He overcame a subversively good defence by Matt Hennessey that had some Canadians on the jury feeling sorry for the defendant and forced them to do the right thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The e-mail was sent in 2003 but came to light only this month as part of an unrelated controversy with his office, forcing Mr. Trent to defend himself against accusations of bigotry &mdash; not because he offended the people of Canada, but because &ldquo;Canadian&rdquo; has apparently become a code word for blacks among American racists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a double meaning to that word and I didn&rsquo;t know it. I was horrified when I learned what it was, and I immediately addressed the issue with the people who brought it up,&rdquo; Mr. Trent told a local Fox News reporter in a recent interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never heard of Canadian being used as a term for a black person or for a racial slur,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had, I would never send that out in an office-wide e-mail that&rsquo;s going to go to people who are going to be offended if they recognize it as such. That would be crazy &hellip; . I&rsquo;m not a racist. I&rsquo;m not a bigot,&rdquo; Mr. Trent said.</p>
<p>Mark Vinson, who was a chief prosecutor in the Harris County office at the time, said he was puzzled by the reference to Canadians when he got the e-mail but was too busy to give it much thought. Then some colleagues informed him about the slang meaning of Canadian, and he felt crushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much has been accomplished in terms of equal opportunities, and the office had a super reputation,&rdquo; Mr. Vinson, who is black, told the National Post. &ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t imagine someone in the office who would engage in that conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he believes Mr. Trent&rsquo;s assurance that he had simply repeated a term used by the prosecutor on the case, Rob Freyer. Mr. Freyer did not return a message left yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Mike. We laugh and talk about the [Dallas] Cowboys,&rdquo; Mr. Vinson said. &ldquo;I truly don&rsquo;t believe that Mike knew what he was saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is unusual that a seasoned attorney like Mr. Trent would not have wondered how a Harris County jury came to be stacked with Canadians. (There were no Canadians on the jury but there were some black members.) &ldquo;The only way that there could have been Canadians on the jury, was if they were born in Canada and then became U.S. citizens, and then became citizens of the county in which the case was tried,&rdquo; Mr. Vinson noted.</p>
<p>Mr. Trent told Fox News that was not out of the question. &ldquo;It would not be impossible or unusual for people from other countries to be on our juries,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was told, and I took it as the literal meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bigger mystery is how &ldquo;Canadian&rdquo; came to be code for black. An online directory of racial slurs defines Canadian as a &ldquo;masked replacement&rdquo; for black.</p>
<p>Last August, a blogger in Cincinnati going by the name CincyBlurg reported that a black friend from the southeastern U.S. had recently discovered that she was being called a Canadian. &ldquo;She told me a story of when she was working in a shop in the South and she overheard some of her customers complaining that they were always waited on by a Canadian at that place. She didn&rsquo;t understand what they were talking about and assumed they must be talking about someone else,&rdquo; the blogger wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this happened several times with different patrons, she mentioned it to one of her co-workers. He told her that &lsquo;Canadian&rsquo; was the new derogatory term that racist Southerners were using to describe persons they would have previously referred to [with the N-word.]&rdquo;</p>
<p>A similar case in Kansas City was reported last year on a Listserv, or electronic mailing list, used by linguistics experts. A University of Kansas linguist said that a waitress friend reported that &ldquo;fellow workers used to use a name for inner-city families that were known to not leave a tip: Canadians. &lsquo;Hey, we have a table of Canadians &hellip; . They&rsquo;re all yours.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
<p>Stefan Dollinger, a postdoctoral fellow in linguistics at University of British Columbia and director of the university&rsquo;s Canadian English lab, speculated that the slur reflects a sense of Canadians as the other. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;code&rsquo; word, is the replacement of a no-longer tolerated label for one outsider group, with, from the U.S. view, another outsider group: Canadians. It could have been terms for Mexicans, Latinos etc. but this would have been too obvious,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s left? Right, the guys to the north.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Back in  South Texas 1980 -85 my best friend was a real Canadian. And he was (ahem!) also an illegal immigrant. He said they were called &#8220;Jet-backs&#8221;  refering to the flight back to the Buffalo New York holding area. The guy was a master printer, the kind that could tell dye concentrations just by sticking a thumb in. The  favorite part of his third and final deportation hearing was when the native Hispanic court bailiff made some derogatory remark about him while  he was in handcuffs. His reply. &#8220;I`m making $86,500 cowboy, how you all doing?!?&#8221; </p>

					<p>This is funny because I didnt realize this term had a national following.  My friend from Michigan was the first to ever use Canadian to refer to blacks and I just thought it was because Michigan is so close to Canada and he&rsquo;s kind of a jokester.  I found it to be pretty funny and have used the term for the past year or so.  People need to lighten up.  I think it&rsquo;s pretty hilarious myself!</p>

					<p>I think it does come from the restaurant industry.  10 years ago when I was a waitress we called them &#8220;special tables&#8221;, but a waiter from elsewhere in the country said they were called &#8220;Canadians&#8221;.  The reason for the derision: blacks were notorious for stiffing servers on tips yet were always very demanding.  If they weren&rsquo;t known for that behavior, they wouldn&rsquo;t have earned the name.  Yet it&rsquo;s just &#8220;racists&#8221; making up this term for no reason.</p>

					<p>I do not converse with anyone, using derogatory terms about blacks or anyone else, unless I know that the person I&rsquo;m speaking with has the exact same feeling. (I still feel bad using the terms jokingly.)  </p>
<p>Mr. Trent would have to know that this would come to light eventually. Those emails/computers can get us into trouble. He should have been more careful; he should have been professional.<br>
(I don&rsquo;t think he needs sensitivity training, though.) He just got caught. </p>
<p>I think the use of &#8216;Canadian&rsquo; is a pretty good replacement for the n-word or &#8216;ninja&rsquo; (I heard that from guys from one GA town.) A made up word would have been too obvious. I&rsquo;m sure the use of &#8216;Canadian&rsquo; is overlooked much of the time. </p>

					<p> New one on me. I&rsquo;ve never heard of referring to blacks as &#8220;Canadians.&#8221; But then, I don&rsquo;t live in the South.<br>
 <br><br>
 I think this habit white liberals have of saying that race-conscious Whites view some other group as &#8220;The Other&#8221;   &mdash;   and making that accusation in a tone that suggests it&rsquo;s a horrible thing to do, peculiar to us nasty old White racists   &mdash;   is an extremely silly one. After all, to every ethnic or racial group in the world, there is some particular group, often either in their midst or living in a contiguous country or state, that is considered &#8220;The Other&#8221; and viewed with suspicion, dislike or downright hatred for a variety of reasons. The tendency is called &#8220;human nature.&#8221;</p>
<p> Lastly, I found it amusing that one use of &#8220;Canadian&#8221; might be among servers in a restaurant: &#8220;There&rsquo;s a table of Canadians who don&rsquo;t tip   &mdash;   you got &#8216;em!&#8221; I seem to recall a posted article on AmRen a couple of years ago about blacks being extremely stingy tippers. It drew a huge number of posts, many from present or former servers, agreeing wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Wow, I thought we were the only ones who said that.  I used to wait tables for a couple of years and the majority of the staff were black.  We white employees referred to black customers as &#8220;Canadians&#8221; so that we could talk about how terrible black customers were without our black co-workers catching on.  Frankly, I thought we had invented it.<br>

					<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that I found this story rather amusing only because I&rsquo;m a real &#8220;Canadian&#8221; sporting a pale face.</p>
<p>I suspect this term <i>did</i> originally come from the restaurant industry. Unlike American Whites, we Canadians have not been fully enculturated in vast numbers, to leaving tips to waitresses and waiters, assuming that management is already paying their wages. </p>
<p>New Zealand, another white commonwealth country I&rsquo;ve visited, is also on the same wavelength as Canadians.</p>
<p>So you see, it&rsquo;s really an <i>American thang</i>.</p>
<p>Black Americans, on the other hand are also reticent to leaving tips on the restaurant table&hellip;but for wholly <i>different</i> reasons.   </p>

<p>However, if I were Canadian  &mdash;  -I&rsquo;d be offended!!!</p>

<p>My ex-wife worked as a waitress in a Washington DC restaurant and they called the black customers &#8216;VIPs&rsquo;.  The funny thing is that the black waiters and waitresses who she worked with also called them &#8216;VIPs&rsquo;.  It was a code so they could commiserate with each other about either getting no tip or a very small tip.  Everyone knew that the black restaurant customer was the worst; little or no tip, bad behavior, etc.</p>
<p>I was not meant to be racist, it was simply a way of talking to your fellow employee about how much money you were or were not making.</p>

					<p>Well it all makes perfect sense!  &#8220;Canadians&#8221; don&rsquo;t leave tips to wait staff in Canadian eateries because Canada is a Socialist nation that has abandoned the concept of discretionary renumeration for varying grades of service that range from incompetent, clueless, and hostile to the respective antonyms of the previously enumerated terms. This is a gem of an etymology lesson that I will cherish for years to come!</p>

This spirit still lives now,, when the government does not.  Remember your insult when &#8220;all our&#8221; guns outnumber thiers, but theirs outnumber yours.<br>

					<p>&ldquo;Stefan Dollinger, a postdoctoral fellow in linguistics at University of British Columbia and director of the university&rsquo;s Canadian English lab, speculated that the slur reflects a sense of Canadians as the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Normally, I don&rsquo;t go along with the Ivory Tower crowd&rsquo;s explanation for things like this. However, here they may be onto something, but I would add a certain amount of my own speculative buttressing, that is not particularly flattering to the Canadian &ldquo;other.&rdquo; </p>
<p>While on the surface, the term &ldquo;Canadian&rdquo; as a Southern codeword for blacks might seem very silly (or even ridiculous,) until one considers that on some police and fire departments (at least in Southeastern Michigan) a code term for blacks was &ldquo;Democrats.&rdquo; In part, this developed out of the fact that most blacks vote for them and the Democratic party was seen as a bunch of Leftist sellouts to them, against white unionized employees. </p>
<p>Given that many Canadians have long held a &ldquo;progressively&rdquo; snooty and almost contemptuous view of Americans as &ldquo;racists,&rdquo; who have caused a race problem in our own country by not treating blacks as &ldquo;equals,&rdquo; does reflect that kind of intended humorous comparison. Compound this with the fact, that Canadians may openly to obnoxiously express such views in the South since they see it as our most egregiously &ldquo;racist&ldquo; region, having such opinions influenced by both our and their Marxist media industries, and the speculative comparison is not that wild. </p>
<p>I do not write this to be insulting to many of the fine Canadian posters here at <span class="caps">AR.</span> On the contrary, I would invite them to either support or challenge my hypothetical scenario above on the origins of the &ldquo;codeword&rdquo; presented above. I simply have had some considerable contact with Canadians in the past (particularly in the late 80s through 90s) while living in Metro Detroit, that often had me aghast at how naive and judgmental they could be regarding American &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; Moreover, the Canadian media (the <span class="caps">CBC </span>in particular) was even worse on this score. <br>

					<p>Steffan Dollinger (post-doctoral fellow of linguistics at The University of British Columbia) is about as clueless as a Dora The Explorer Doll is as to the etymology of &#8220;Canadian&#8221;.  Just ask any waitress in Myrtle Beach, SC what &#8220;Canadian&#8221; means and they&rsquo;ll universally without exception tell you that it refers to <span class="caps">ANY </span>food service customer perceived to be unlikely to tip no matter how exemplary the table service rendered might be.  And Blacks are Canadians in this context.</p>

					<p>Marxist bigots(black and white, Christian or Jew) are at it all the time; always intimating something sinister about anything a white -Christians says or does; of course this doesn&rsquo;t ever apply to any any non-white or non-Christian, that itself proves my point of their own specific bigotry type hate crime.Such double standard hypocrites the &#8220;left&#8221; is always showing.</p>

Funny. I wonder if this is happening on anything more than a very limited scale? Based on the examples provided, it may be that no more than a few people   &mdash;   all a degree of separation or two away from each other   &mdash;   are using this term so far. </p>
<p>Yet I suspect it could achieve some cultural momentum. Every neologism has to start out with just one or two people saying it. In the &rsquo;60s somebody had to make up the word &#8220;hippie&#8221; and in the &rsquo;80s somebody had to make up the word &#8220;yuppie.&#8221; So in future, phrases like &#8220;shiftless Canadians&#8221; or even &#8220;uppity Canadians&#8221; might well come into more general usage. </p>
<p>After all, as the Speech Police exile more and more old terms get exiled to the Forbidden Zone, new substitutes and euphemisms will inevitably need to be invented. Otherwise the English language, after centuries of robust expansion, will <span class="caps">SHRINK </span>  &mdash;   just like Orwell&rsquo;s Ingsoc was designed to do. <br>

					<p>I live in the South and used to wait tables for years.  The wait staff was mostly black and we white waiters used to refer to black customers as &#8220;Canadians&#8221; so that we could complain about how terrible black customers were without them knowing.  I though we had made it up but I guess not.  Also, a lot of my friends in college referred to blacks as &#8220;nogs&#8221; which I hear is  catching on.</p>

					<p>I was a waiter in northern New Jersey in 1999 and 2000.  &#8220;Canadian&#8221; was code for blacks because, on average, they were horrible tippers  and extremely demanding to wait on.  Nobody, not even the black servers, wanted to wait on a black family because it meant 3x the work and 1/3rd the tip.  Every once in a while you&rsquo;d get a generous black guest, but more often than not they would tip on the low end - like 10%, but it was common for them to tip even less, sometimes an insulting single dollar bill or two dollars on a check for 30 or 40 bux.  On three occasions in my 2 years of being a waiter, I got no tip despite providing exemplary service - all 3 times the guests were black.  And they&rsquo;d run you around like crazy - the food was never quite right, something wasn&rsquo;t cooked to their specifications, they wanted something prepared unusually, the soda didn&rsquo;t taste right, more condiments, ridiculous requests to substitute items for other things, it never ended!!  </p>

					<p>This is amazing! I couldn&rsquo;t believe it when I saw this article.<br>
 A friend of ours from Philadelpha has been using that term for some years now when describing Blacks. When I asked him the reason, he told me that he&rsquo;s heard it from someone who had told <span class="caps">HIM </span>that the term was used because when a group of Blacks are talking, their Patois combined with the decibel range at which they speak,comes out sounding like a gaggle of Canadian geese.</p>

					<p> The more authority given to them to decide what is racist; the more they will find. The black population will continue to paint the white race into an ever shrinking corner until the only thing left is our existance; which they will then find extrememly racist; at that point the wholesale extermination will begin.<br>
 Of course the federal government (not wanting to be accused of racism) will wholeheartedly support this holucaust to appease the black race.</p>

<p>Yes I worked with a black woman who stated that the service was rarely good enough to receive a tip. I asked her how much she tipped if the service <span class="caps">WAS </span>good and she said maybe 10%. On an $8 lunch tab that would only be 80 cents, and the waiter may have to visit the table 5 or 6 times for that pathetic 80 cents.</p>
<p>They wait for the tiniest thing to be less than perfect then they make a big deal out of it to justify the puny (or non-existent) tip. Then they claim that servers are racist because they do not want to wait on them. Amazing.</p>

					<p>I waited tables in college in Virginia. This was my first exposure to the &#8216;joys of diversity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Our Manager was a very refined soft-spoken southern woman who made reference to blacks by simply saying the word &#8216;people&rsquo; <span class="caps">TWICE.</span> For example: &#8220;Jay, we have a large table of <span class="caps">PEOPLE&hellip;</span>people coming in. Keep an eye on them.&#8221; </p>
<p>As backup, she would visit the table a few times to ask how everything was going and would comment on how &#8216;special&rsquo; one or two of the items were and how they were made. More often than not, she would ask one of us to get them something simple  &mdash;  -some extra rolls, etc. Her manner was that of a sixth grade school teacher and really worked wonders. Both she and the wait staff knew it was just a little game, but it really did help prevent bigger problems  &mdash;  mainly by getting the blacks to think they were getting something &#8216;extra&rsquo; when they weren&rsquo;t, and keeping them <span class="caps">DISTRACTED.   </span></p>
<p>My friend worked at a &#8216;black&rsquo; restaurant, with a black manager. Things there didn&rsquo;t go so well. After a few months she stopped saying that she was going to work. Instead she would say she had to go &#8216;slop the Zulus&rsquo;. </p>
<p>From my experiences and the experiences of others, I learned a few things.</p>
<p>The First Rule of Dealing with Blacks: <span class="caps">DON&rsquo;T</span> DO IT <span class="caps">UNLESS YOU HAVE</span> TO! It&rsquo;s just not worth it. The only people who choose to deal with blacks exclusively do so behind 2&#8221; thick bullet proof glass, e.g., the Koreans and Vietnamese.</p>
<p>The Second Rule is: <span class="caps">DUMB</span> IT <span class="caps">DOWN</span> TO <span class="caps">THEIR LEVEL.</span> Not all blacks are stupid, but many are. When dealing with LaCheryl or Kwantel, (whether in a store, post office, etc.) just <span class="caps">ACCEPT THE FACT </span>that they <span class="caps">CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU</span> ON <span class="caps">YOUR LEVEL.</span> This frightens them, and more often than not evokes a &#8216;primitive&rsquo; response  &mdash;  -such as an &#8216;attitude&rsquo;, &#8216;acting out&rsquo;, violence, etc. Your getting angry/impatient/frustrated isn&rsquo;t going to make <span class="caps">THEM </span>any smarter. They are stuck with being stupid. Our public schools and universities know this all to well. </p>
<p>Just like the Southern woman in the example above, try to gauge their &#8216;mental age&rsquo; and act accordingly. Typically this age is about 13   &mdash;  - that of an adolescent. </p>
<p>Third Rule: If things are escalating with your &#8216;13 year olds&rsquo;, <span class="caps">REASON DOESN&rsquo;T WORK.</span> Try a distraction.  For most whites, emotion is <span class="caps">NOT </span>an argument. For most blacks, <span class="caps">EMOTION</span> IS <span class="caps">THE ARGUMENT.</span> Toss them something shiny to play with. Could be a compliment, for example  &mdash;  - &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry you folks thought the service was slow. <span class="caps">YOUR SUCH</span> A <span class="caps">NICE LOOKING COUPLE, </span>let me see if I can get you something <span class="caps">EXTRA </span>to make up for it (i.e. a 20 cent bowl of ice cream)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fourth Rule: If things are getting violent: disengage, and warn everyone around you (this only works if the blacks are &#8216;off&rsquo; their turf). The idea that the po&rsquo;-leese&rsquo; may be involved soon will usually put most blacks off  &mdash;  -but not all. </p>
<p>Avoid violence if you can. Generally, you have more to lose than they do&hellip;.and they know it. Simply walk (or run) away. </p>
<p><span class="caps">FINAL RULE</span>: If you can&rsquo;t walk or run away, and fear for your life: refer to rule .357<br>

					<p>Once upon a time, the word &#8220;Canadian&#8221; was used to refer to Jews in some quarters. In recent times, it is almost exclusively used to refer to blacks. </p>
<p>Some blacks were so oblivous, that others could make remarks concerning Canadians in their presence and it would go right over their heads.</p>
<p>As for the origins of the word being used in this manner, I don&rsquo;t know for certain. Fugitive slaves using the Underground Railroad oftentimes continued North until they reached Ontario or Quebec. </p>
<p>Canadians are sometimes referred to as Canucks or Loonies (the Canadian dollar is a coin which features a loon on its reverse side).</p>

					<p>Some Canadians are poor at tipping, so that might be the basis for the reference. Given the Socialist policies in place in Canada, the tight behaviors may be a defense mechanism since nobody seems to ever have enough money up there. Everything that you do is taxed to the max. On a recent visit, the cost of a soft drink and candy bar in Canada was $3.40 (in Canadian currency). The same thing may have cost $1.75-$2.00 in the <span class="caps">USA.</span><br>
A beer purchase at a government owned store cost $14.00 in Canada. </p>
<p>Canadian retailers are complaining that almost all Canadians living in proximity to the American border are choosing to shop in the <span class="caps">USA </span>in order to save money. The recent parity in American and Canadian currency is a factor, but the real problem is Canadians are taxed so much that it interferes with their standard of living. Bear this in mind when the politicians in the <span class="caps">USA </span>want to redesign our government and health care to resemble Ottawa.    </p>
<p>Many Canadians end up pinching pennies and this habit carries over to their spending behavior when they are tourists. Canadians like to visit Cuba because it is a cheap vacation since Fidel is hard up for hard currency. As for blacks, the lousy tipping practices would qualify them to be Canadians.  </p>

					<p>&#8220;Many Canadians end up pinching pennies and this habit carries over to their spending behavior when they are tourists&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Canada and while the taxes are  higher there is also the factor of the way people are paid. Here in the <span class="caps">US, </span>waiters get a low hourly wage because the tips make up for it. In Canada and many other countries, waiters are paid a higher wage but don&rsquo;t rely on tips. When Canadians visit the <span class="caps">US, </span>they bring their practices with them. When I visit Canada, I always tip as if I were in the US and I noticed that many of the tips were in US dollars.</p>

					<p>I tipped in Canada as I would in the <span class="caps">USA.</span> The taxi cab driver almost turned cartwheels as a result.</p>
<p>I think in many Canadian establishments the tip is built into the price of the service, so fewer people tip and those who do give less.  </p>

<p>Yes, this is the case in most other countries. The tip, if any,  that&rsquo;s left is just the little loose change that&rsquo;s left over, but it isn&rsquo;t much.  And not much is expected.<br>

					<p>In addition to lousy tips, some blacks go out of their way to be rude: placing the coins on a dirty plate of uneaten food and gravy and challenging the waitress to dig it out. In the end, most refuse to pick up the coins and the dishwashers end up with the pennies and dimes. </p>

<p>You know your stuff. There&rsquo;s nothing like experience with blacks to understand blacks and you obviously had the experience.</p>
<p>Your first rule is mine: if you can, avoid blacks altogether. No contact, no problems. Since I travel in an &#8216;urban&rsquo; setting, no contact is impossible but I avoid contact and make no effort to initiate contact.</p>
<p>Dumb it down or keep it simple stupid. I have had the same experience with blacks. They get frustrated because they can&rsquo;t understand things which seem obvious to us. Explain things simply and slowly and hope they catch on.</p>
<p>Reason doesn&rsquo;t work so don&rsquo;t argue. What I do is apologize for my transgression; whatever it may be. &#8216;I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t understand the issue. It&rsquo;s my fault. You&rsquo;re right, I&rsquo;m wrong. I&rsquo;m going to walk away now. Have a nice day&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Interaction with blacks is like handling dynamite with blasting caps inserted. If you have to deal with blacks, fain caring and compassion and then move away&hellip;</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m from Alabama and racial slurs aren&rsquo;t that uncommon here, even today. I&rsquo;ve never heard blacks referred to as Canadians. It must be an upper south (North Carolina Virginia) as opposed to an deep south( Georgia Alabama) thing. </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve heard and used &#8216;Toby&rsquo; a few times, but even for them that&rsquo;s not quite subtle enough. They will search their minds a moment and then it dawns on them where that name comes from. I&rsquo;ve only done that after being called &#8216;white boy&rsquo;, or some other condescending remark, once too often for me to ignore. I reserve the right to slur back, but with a less charged word.</p>
