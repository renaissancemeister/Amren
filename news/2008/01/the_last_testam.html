<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>When 30 years ago I resurrected Flashman, the bully in Thomas Hughes&rsquo;s Victorian novel Tom Brown&rsquo;s Schooldays, political correctness hadn&rsquo;t been heard of, and no exception was taken to my adopted hero&rsquo;s character, behaviour, attitude to women and subject races (indeed, any races, including his own) and general awfulness.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it soon became evident that these were his main attractions. He was politically incorrect with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Through the Seventies and Eighties I led him on his disgraceful way, toadying, lying, cheating, running away, treating women as chattels, abusing inferiors of all colours, with only one redeeming virtue &mdash; the unsparing honesty with which he admitted to his faults, and even gloried in them.</p>
<p>And no one minded, or if they did, they didn&rsquo;t tell me. In all the many thousands of readers&rsquo; letters I received, not one objected.</p>
<p>In the Nineties, a change began to take place. Reviewers and interviewers started describing Flashman (and me) as politically incorrect, which we are, though by no means in the same way.</p>
<p>This is fine by me. Flashman is my bread and butter, and if he wasn&rsquo;t an elitist, racist, sexist swine, I&rsquo;d be selling bootlaces at street corners instead of being a successful popular writer.</p>
<p>But what I notice with amusement is that many commentators now draw attention to Flashy&rsquo;s (and my) political incorrectness in order to make a point of distancing themselves from it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they dislike the books. But where once the non-PC thing could pass unremarked, they now feel they must warn readers that some may find Flashman offensive, and that his views are certainly not those of the interviewer or reviewer, God forbid.</p>
<p>I find the disclaimers alarming. They are almost a knee-jerk reaction and often rather a nervous one, as if the writer were saying: &#8220;Look, I&rsquo;m not a racist or sexist. I hold the right views and I&rsquo;m in line with modern enlightened thought, honestly.&#8221;</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t risk saying anything to which the PC lobby could take exception. And it is this that alarms me &mdash; the fear evident in so many sincere and honest folk of being thought out of step.</p>
<p>I first came across this in the United States, where the cancer has gone much deeper. As a screenwriter [at which Fraser was almost as successful as he was with the 12 Flashman novels; his best-known work was scripting the Three Musketeers films] I once put forward a script for a film called The Lone Ranger, in which I used a piece of Western history which had never been shown on screen and was as spectacular as it was shocking &mdash; and true.</p>
<p>The whisky traders of the American plains used to build little stockades, from which they passed out their ghastly rot-gut liquor through a small hatch to the Indians, who paid by shoving furs back though the hatch.</p>
<p>The result was that frenzied, drunken Indians who had run out of furs were besieging the stockade, while the traders sat snug inside and did not emerge until the Indians had either gone away or passed out.</p>
<p>Political correctness stormed onto the scene, red in tooth and claw. The word came down from on high that the scene would offend &#8220;Native Americans&#8221;.</p>
<p>Their ancestors may have got pieeyed on moonshine but they didn&rsquo;t want to know it, and it must not be shown on screen. Damn history. Let&rsquo;s pretend it didn&rsquo;t happen because we don&rsquo;t like the look of it.</p>
<p>I think little of people who will deny their history because it doesn&rsquo;t present the picture they would like.</p>
<p>My forebears from the Highlands of Scotland were a fairly primitive, treacherous, blood-thirsty bunch and, as Robert Louis Stevenson once wrote, would have been none the worse for washing. Fine, let them be so depicted, if any film maker feels like it; better that than insulting, inaccurate drivel like Braveheart.</p>
<p>The philosophy of political correctness is now firmly entrenched over here, too, and at its core is a refusal to look the truth squarely in the face, unpalatable as it may be.</p>
<p>Political correctness is about denial, usually in the weasel circumlocutory jargon which distorts and evades and seldom stands up to honest analysis.</p>
<p>It comes in many guises, some of them so effective that the PC can be difficult to detect. The silly euphemisms, apparently harmless, but forever dripping to wear away common sense &mdash; the naivete of the phrase &#8220;a caring force for the future&#8221; on Remembrance poppy trays, which suggests that the army is some kind of peace corps, when in fact its true function is killing.</p>
<p>The continual attempt to soften and sanitise the harsh realities of life in the name of liberalism, in an effort to suppress truths unwelcome to the PC mind; the social engineering which plays down Christianity, demanding equal status for alien religions.</p>
<p>The selective distortions of history, so beloved by New Labour, denigrating Britain&rsquo;s past with such propaganda as hopelessly unbalanced accounts of the slave trade, laying all the blame on the white races, but carefully censoring the truth that not a slave could have come out of Africa without the active assistance of black slavers, and that the trade was only finally suppressed by the Royal Navy virtually single-handed.</p>
<p>In schools, the waging of war against examinations as &#8220;elitist&#8221; exercises which will undermine the confidence of those who fail &mdash; what an intelligent way to prepare children for real life in which competition and failure are inevitable, since both are what life, if not liberal lunacy, is about.</p>
<p>PC also demands that &#8220;stress&#8221;, which used to be coped with by less sensitive generations, should now be compensated by huge cash payments lavished on griping incompetents who can&rsquo;t do their jobs, and on policemen and firemen &#8220;traumatised&#8221; by the normal hazards of work which their predecessors took for granted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it makes grieving part of the national culture, as it was on such a nauseating scale when large areas were carpeted in rotting vegetation in &#8220;mourning&#8221; for the Princess of Wales; and it insists that anyone suffering ordinary hardship should be regarded as a &#8220;victim&#8221; &mdash; and, of course, be paid for it.</p>
<p>That PC should have become acceptable in Britain is a glaring symptom of the country&rsquo;s decline.</p>
<p>No generation has seen their country so altered, so turned upside down, as children like me born in the 20 years between the two world wars. In our adult lives Britain&rsquo;s entire national spirit, its philosophy, values and standards, have changed beyond belief.</p>
<p>Probably no country on earth has experienced such a revolution in thought and outlook and behaviour in so short a space.</p>
<p>Other lands have known what seem to be greater upheavals, the result of wars and revolutions, but these do not compare with the experience of a country which passed in less than a lifetime from being the mightiest empire in history, governing a quarter of mankind, to being a feeble little offshore island whose so-called leaders have lost the will and the courage, indeed the ability, to govern at all.</p>
<p>This is not a lament for past imperial glory, though I regret its inevitable passing, nor is it the raging of a die-hard Conservative.</p>
<p>I loathe all political parties, which I regard as inventions of the devil. My favourite prime minister was Sir Alec Douglas-Home, not because he was on the Right, but because he spent a year in office without, on his own admission, doing a damned thing.</p>
<p>This would not commend him to New Labour, who count all time lost when they&rsquo;re not wrecking the country.</p>
<p>I am deeply concerned for the United Kingdom and its future. I look at the old country as it was in my youth and as it is today and, to use a fine Scots word, I am scunnered.</p>
<p>I know that some things are wonderfully better than they used to be: the new miracles of surgery, public attitudes to the disabled, the health and well-being of children, intelligent concern for the environment, the massive strides in science and technology.</p>
<p>Yes, there are material blessings and benefits innumerable which were unknown in our youth.</p>
<p>But much has deteriorated. The United Kingdom has begun to look more like a Third World country, shabby, littered, ugly, run down, without purpose or direction, misruled by a typical Third World government, corrupt, incompetent and undemocratic.</p>
<p>My generation has seen the decay of ordinary morality, standards of decency, sportsmanship, politeness, respect for the law, family values, politics and education and religion, the very character of the British.</p>
<p>Oh how Blimpish this must sound to modern ears, how out of date, how blind to &#8220;the need for change and the novelty of a new age&#8221;. But don&rsquo;t worry about me. It&rsquo;s the present generation with their permissive society, their anything-goes philosophy, and their generally laid-back, inyerface attitude I feel sorry for.</p>
<p>They regard themselves as a completely liberated society when in fact they <br>
Indeed, there may never have been such an enslaved generation, in thrall to hang-ups, taboos, restrictions and oppressions unknown to their ancestors (to say nothing of being neck-deep in debt, thanks to a moneylender&rsquo;s economy).</p>
<p>We were freer by far 50 years ago &mdash; yes, even with conscription, censorship, direction of labour, rationing, and shortages of everything that nowadays is regarded as essential to enjoyment.</p>
<p>We still had liberty beyond modern understanding because we had other freedoms, the really important ones, that are denied to the youth of today.</p>
<p>We could say what we liked; they can&rsquo;t. We were not subject to the aggressive pressure of special-interest minority groups; they are. We had no worries about race or sexual orientation; they have. We could, and did, differ from fashionable opinion with impunity, and would have laughed PC to scorn, had our society been weak and stupid enough to let it exist.</p>
<p>We had available to us an education system, public and private, that was the envy of the world. We had little reason to fear being mugged or raped (killed in war, maybe, but that was an acceptable hazard).</p>
<p>Our children could play in street and country in safety. We had few problems with bullies because society knew how to deal with bullying and was not afraid to punish it in ways that would send today&rsquo;s progressives into hysterics.</p>
<p>We did not know the stifling tyranny of a liberal establishment, determined to impose its views, and beginning to resemble George Orwell&rsquo;s Ministry of Truth.</p>
<p>Above all, we knew who we were and we lived in the knowledge that certain values and standards held true, and that our country, with all its faults and need for reforms, was sound at heart.</p>
<p>Not any more. I find it difficult to identify a time when the country was as badly governed as it has been in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>We have had the two worst Prime Ministers in our history &mdash; Edward Heath (who dragooned us into the Common Market) and Tony Blair. The harm these two have done to Britain is incalculable and almost certainly irreparable.</p>
<p>Whether the public can be blamed for letting them pursue their ruinous policies is debatable.</p>
<p>Short of assassination there is little people can do when their political masters have forgotten the true meaning of the democracy of which they are forever prating, are determined to have their own way at all costs and hold public opinion in contempt.</p>
<p>I feel I speak not just for myself but for the huge majority of my generation who think as I do but whose voices are so often lost in the clamour.</p>
<p>We are yesterday&rsquo;s people, the over-the-hill gang. (Yes, the old people &mdash; not the senior citizens or the time-challenged, but the old people.) Those of ultra-liberal views may take consolation from this &mdash; that my kind won&rsquo;t be around much longer, and then they can get on with wrecking civilisation in peace.</p>
<p>But they should beware. There may well be more who think like me than the liberal Left establishment likes to think. When my views were first published in book form in 2002, I was not surprised that almost all the reviewers were unfavourable. I had expected that my old-fashioned views would get a fairly hostile reception, but the bitterness did astonish me.</p>
<p>I had not realised how offensive the plain truth can be to the politically correct, how enraged they can be by its mere expression, and how deeply they detest the values and standards respected 50 years ago and which dinosaurs like me still believe in, God help us.</p>
<p>But the readers&rsquo; reactions to the book were the exact opposite of critical opinion. I have never received such wholehearted and generous support.</p>
<p>For the first time in 30 years as a professional writer I had to fall back on a printed card thanking readers for writing, apologising because I could not reply personally to them all.</p>
<p>Most of the letters came from the older generation, but by no means all. I was made aware that among the middle-aged and people in their 20s and 30s there is a groundswell of anger and frustration at the damage done to Britain by so-called reformers and dishonest politicians who hardly bother to conceal their contempt for the public&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p>Plainly many thought they were alone in some reactionary minority. They had been led to think that they were voices muttering to themselves in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Well, you are not. There are more of you out there than you realise &mdash; very many more, perhaps even a majority.</p>

			<p>I`ve never been a fan of &#8220;Flashman&#8221; like my buddy is, being more of a John Carter of Mars man, but I`m ready to give him a second look after that refreshing dose of honesty. Also, is there anyone today who would have the courage to do a Don Rickles style stichk against political correctness?!? </p>

<p>If I didn&rsquo;t know better, I&rsquo;d think he was talking about the United States of America in general and the state of Illinois in particular.  </p>
<p>When, at any time in its nearly 200 year history, has the Prairie State simultaneously featured US Senators Dick &#8220;Turban&#8221; and Barry Obama, governor Rod Blagojevich, state house speaker Mike Madigan, mayor Richard &#8220;Green&#8221; Daley, Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrakhan, and &#8220;Crook&#8221; County chairman Todd Stroger?  A state has to work hard to contain all of these knuckleheads within our 56,000 square miles.  Couldn&rsquo;t Iowa or Indiana take a few of these clods off our hands? </p>

			<p>This is interesting comming from a writer of books, as the LEFT had always supported rabid &#8220;free speech&#8221; during the cold war. Ginsberb the &#8216;poet&rsquo; said the &#8216;F&rsquo; word on Radio around 1958, and that was a big deal. After the cold war (the 90&rsquo;s) the politics turned inward, and feminism became the &#8216;conservative&rsquo; norm. It is now the established conservative norm, so it may take the next generation to rebel against it. Hopefully not that long, though.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The philosophy of political correctness is now firmly entrenched over here, too, and at its core is a refusal to look the truth squarely in the face, unpalatable as it may be.&#8221;</p>
<p>They never seem to grasp that it&rsquo;s not just &#8216;PC&rsquo; or &#8216;Diversity&rsquo; or &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; or &#8216;enlightened liberalism&rsquo;, no, and that what they really need, for starters, is something like the BNP. Political-Correctness isn&rsquo;t about some neutral &#8216;fairness&rsquo; for all. Diversity isn&rsquo;t an agenda that benefits every group, and all groups need to give up a little bit in order to bring it about. &#8216;Diversity&rsquo; where it is carried out, begins with discrimination against whites and goes onward from there. At it&rsquo;s best, it&rsquo;s not some multicultural utopia, it&rsquo;s a one-way anti-white agenda, on all counts. It has nothing to do with playing nice and &#8220;refusing to look the truth square in the face&#8221;. Unpleasant facts demeaning whites (inciting racial-hatred of whites), aren&rsquo;t covered up at all. Not only are some unpleasant facts not covered up, it&rsquo;s literally a crime to deny them. </p>

			<p>Many of you may not know that Fraser died on January 1, receiving very little notice in the media.  He was a fine novelist and, as you can see in this essay, remarkably learned and intelligent.  He will be missed.</p>

			<p>Back in 1952 whilst living in London, I made a purchase.  Among the change I received was a penny (a copper coin approximately the size of a half-a-crown or a Nevada silver half-dollar) minted in the days of Queen Anne and 240 years later, still in circulation and still legal tender.  (Like a damned fool I didn&rsquo;t keep it but got rid of it as fast as I could.) </p>
<p>Pray indulge this relic and permit me to retrieve from my memory bank the old duodecimal English pound when it still was &#8216;sterling&rsquo;, before it will be lost in the mist of time.  In those days there were only two bank notes in circulation, the one-pound note (20 shillings = 240 pennies) and a 10/- (ten shilling) note, the rest were coins both silver &amp; copper and what magnificent coins they were, lovely to look at, delightful to handle; they had a  &#8216;heft&rsquo; to it.  On one side was the image of the sovereign and on the other side were various (depending on the denomination) the Royal Arms, the crests of England &amp; Scotland as well as a collage of the rose of England, the thistle of Scotland &amp; the shamrock of Ireland.  Compared to these coins, the coinage of all other nations the U.S. included seemed shabby.  There were the silver coins, half-a-crown (2s 6d or 2/6), the florin (2/-) the shilling (1/- or 12d) the six-pence (6d), and there was even a tiny itsy-bitsy 3-penny silver coin minted for the sole purpose to enable housewives to insert them into the traditional Christmas plum pudding.  And to round it all off, there were the copper coins, the penny (1d – Britannia ruling the waves on the reverse side), the ha&rsquo;penny (1/2d) and the farthing (1/4d).   </p>
<p>Then, in the 1970s the Utopian Marxists got hold of the levers of power and decided, amongst other things, to rationalize the British monetary system.  Never mind that the &#8216;pound sterling&rsquo; was the oldest and most trusted of currencies in the world at that time.  It was messy, illogical, inconvenient and, worst of all unreasonable &mdash; just like the human beings who handled them, which was enough to damn it in the eyes of every social engineer.   They decimalized the pound (no longer sterling); they even displaced the symbol of the penny &#8216;d&rsquo; (for denarius) with the &#8216;p&rsquo; (for penny) thus breaking the last link between Britain, (once Great) and Britain (once Roman).  As for coins that replaced the old ones, well grab a few and look at them with special attention to that sorry excuse of what once was the British Pound Sterling.  Shoddy is the term that comes to mind, slipshod is another.   Any self-respecting coiner would be ashamed to turn out such sloppy work.  </p>
<p>Postscripts</p>
<p>-o- There were various one-pound notes in circulation.  One, issued by the Bank of England (a private institution then) was worth 20 shillings all over the British Isles.  Also a number of Scottish banks had the right to print one-pound bank notes, 20 shillings in Scotland but discounted 5% in England, Wales and both Irelands (i.e. 19 shillings 6 pence or 19/6) which was another reason for Scots to bear a grudge against those Sassenachs.</p>
<p>-o- Back in those days the British caste system still functioned.  Whilst tailors, butchers, &amp; candlestick makers charged for their labor &mdash; oops, sorry &mdash; labour in pounds, professional gentlemen like lawyers, doctors &amp; Indian chiefs quoted their fees in guineas (21 shillings)</p>
<p>-o- It must be remembered that there has always been a strong republican strain amongst the English.  They are, after all, the only people in recorded history who legally executed two anointed monarchs (Mary, Queen of France and Scotland &amp; Charles I of Great Britain) with warrants for their executions properly drawn up complete with valid signatures and seals.</p>
<p>-o- As an aside, one of the many things European are upset with Americans about, is our insistence of sticking with gallons, quarts and pints, as well as miles, feet and inches, not forgetting pounds and ounces rather than behaving rationally and joining the rest of the world in adopting the metric system (but then, we were the last nation in the Western world to adopt the Gregorian calendar).</p>
<p>-o- As of today, of the 180-odd nations cluttering up this planet of ours, the United States is, politically speaking, the fourth oldest ranking right behind Denmark, Sweden &amp; Great Britain.  If and when the United States of Europe becomes a fact, we&rsquo;ll be No. 1 in seniority, and won&rsquo;t you just hate it.</p>

			<p>  Bravo!!  Now, all that is left is for the conservative amoungst us, in the united states and great britain, and actually all the &#8220;west&#8221;; is for us to show some solidarity and guts and revolt. We can revolt in whatever manner or degree that is necessary to save the &#8220;west&#8221;. No apologies to anybody, take our western countries back. Save them and ourselves. The longer we wait, the more severe the revolution will have to be to affect change. We are at a crossroad, those amoungst us whom believe it is too late, get out of the way. Our ancestors met as great or greater challenges and won the day. So can we, it is not hopeless.</p>

			<p>Thank you E David Litvak for that nostalgic reminder.  You missed the crown, or five-shilling coin.  I remember it was a great treat to get one of those for a birthday present.  They were huge!</p>
<p>When Britain issued the new one-pound coin, somebody named it the &#8220;Thatcher&#8221;, because &#8220;it&rsquo;s thick and brassy and thinks it&rsquo;s a sovereign&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Sir Harry Flashman on the outbreak of the Great War in 1914: &#8220;It isn&rsquo;t important if you win or lose, so long as you survive.  So long as your people survive.  And that&rsquo;s the only good reason for fighting that anyone ever invented.  The survival of your people and race and kind.  That&rsquo;s the only victory that matters.&#8221;  From &#8220;Mr. American&#8221;.  <br>
     I always thought that Fraser was letting Flashman speak for him in that dialogue.  I don&rsquo;t know that he was a WN, but he was a real British fighting man and patriot.  R.I.P.  </p>

			<p>Flashy was certainly non PC  i read most of the novels and plan on rereading them when I have time. You want the N word? you got it in a completely un selfconscious way with Flashy. Yet.. as I recall, in a novel where he meets say, Frederick Douglass, Flashman still treats everyone with dignity. This author will be missed, but his work will live on. We  all could benefit from a bracing dose of Flashman.</p>
<p>The post about Pounds and Guineas was so informative. I am not a youngster, and I had really almost forgotten about all that Victorian (Edwardian?) money with all its confusing charm.</p>

			<p>Oh no! No more Flashy. Some quotes for Americans who may not be familiar with the character.</p>
<p>* &#8220;For the moment though, he had the grace to look troubled; he probably thought he owed it to his princely dignity to do something for me. But he managed to fight it down - they usually do.&#8221;   &mdash;   from &#8216;Royal Flash&rsquo;.</p>
<p>* &#8220;So you can see why they resented white interlopers who bade fair to undermine their empire with poppy drug, and did their damnedest to stop the trade, but couldn&rsquo;t. To their chagrin, they discovered that their God-given superiority, their highly-refined taste in eggshell pottery, and their limitless lines of ancestors availed them nothing against any Dundee pirate with a pistol on his hip and a six-pounder in his bows who was determined to run his opium in&#8221;   &mdash;   from &#8216;Flashman and the Dragon&rsquo;</p>
<p>* &#8220;Do you mean to tell me&#8221;, says I, astonished, &#8220;that Josiah is smuggling poppy?&#8221; I know the Church is game for anything as a rule, and Hong Kong existed only for the opium trade, most everyone was in it. But it don&rsquo;t go with dog-collars and Sunday school, exactly&#8221;   &mdash;   from &#8216;Flashman and the Dragon&rsquo;.</p>
<p>* &#8220;Well, that was Ensign Wessel taken care of. He&rsquo;d cut the whole bloody German army to bits before he&rsquo;d let anyone near Irma. Likewise, and more important, he didn&rsquo;t doubt his prince for a moment. Ah, the ideals of youth, I thought, as I sorted through the keys&#8221;   &mdash;   from &#8216;Royal Flash&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Vale Flashman.</p>

			<p>Excellent article. Absolutely excellent. The Flashman was great literature. He was the supreme cad. The guy you loved to hate. The J.R. Ewing of the Victorian era British empire. However the two worst prime ministers in British history were 1) Winston Churchill and 2) Clement Atlee. The first destroyed Britain&rsquo;s stong position in the world by his anti-German policies and ruined the empire. The second brought the empire home with his INSANE 1948 Commonwealth citizenship act, the single worst thing any British government has ever done in all of history. 1948 may yet prove to be a more decisive date in British history then 1066 because it allowed another conquest of Britain. Only this time the British didn&rsquo;t even try to make a stand at Senlac hill. Give Harold credit for that at least.</p>

Excellent analysis, sorry to hear the author has left us. </p>
<p>One of Fraser&rsquo;s comic-swashbuckler &#8220;Flashman&#8221; novels was filmed in 1975 as &#8220;Royal Flash,&#8221; starring Malcolm McDowell (of &#8220;Clockwork Orange&#8221;), and directed by Richard Lester (of the &rsquo;60s Beatles movies and the &rsquo;70s &#8220;Three Musketeers&#8221; movies). </p>
<p>Although Flashman books were popular (esp. in UK), the film was not (esp. in US), so there were no sequels (as there should have been). But if you liked Fraser&rsquo;s article   &mdash;   and how could any AmRen reader NOT like it?   &mdash;   then you should find &#8220;Royal Flash&#8221; a funny, exciting, and decidedly non-PC entertainment from an earlier, earthier era when Britain was still Great&hellip; and when men still had a pair. <br>

			<p>Mr. Fraser correctly addresses the symptoms, but not the actual cause of Britain&rsquo;s current problems.  The cause is quite simply the insanely liberal policy that Britain chose to adopt on social issues and immigration.  Following the disastrously idiotic World Wars which wiped out many tens of millions of Europe&rsquo;s best and brightest, the Brits (like many other European nations) were desperate for labor manpower.  They resorted to massive immigration from the 3rd world to resolve the shortage, and as a result they have completely changed the character and destiny of their nation.</p>
<p>With the change in demographics and society that their liberal leftists policies produced, Britons are rapidly building a nation that will be just another conglomerated mishmash of multiculturalism.  What made them &#8220;British&#8221; will be gone, and their nation and people will be lost in the process.</p>
<p>They have forgotten that nations are more than just lines on a map, and they will lose everything because of it   &mdash;  - just like all the other nations in the beleaguered White world.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve read two of the Flashman books.  They were both hillariously entertaining.  Fraser is an excellent writer.  The Flashman books are meant to be a good read, not social satire.  Nonetheless, in today&rsquo;s times the un-PC life of Harry Flashman is a nice place to escape to.</p>

			<p>LIBERALISM IS BARBARIANISM.</p>
<p>This is a great article and the writer points out the various facets of &#8220;liberalism&#8221; that has been foisted on the public, and which the gullible public has accepted lying down.</p>
<p>But if you think carefully, all these &#8220;liberal&#8221; ideas are anti-truth, anti-culture, anti-society, anti-values and anti-national.  They are basically barabarianism disguised as &#8220;liberalism&#8221;.  That is why I call their proponents libbarbarians.</p>
<p>I think we can make some headway if we stop using the scam word &#8220;liberalism&#8221; and instead call it what it is:  libbarbarianism or neo-barbarianism.  It would make these perverse ideas more repugnant to more people.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Many of you may not know that Fraser died on January 1, receiving very little notice in the media. He was a fine novelist and, as you can see in this essay, remarkably learned and intelligent. He will be missed.</p>
<p>Posted by at 7:25 PM on January 7&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed I didn&rsquo;t.  I will miss him.  He is one of my very favorite writers.  I highly recommend his books to everyone I know (well, almost everyone).  They are - mostly - historically accurate, highly informative, and gut-burstingly funny.</p>
<p>Farewell Flashy.  Knock back a peg or two for us, whilst your watching the sun set on Britain from God&rsquo;s veranda.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But much has deteriorated. The United Kingdom has begun to look more like a Third World country, shabby, littered, ugly, run down, without purpose or direction, misruled by a typical Third World government, corrupt, incompetent and undemocratic&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>Some years back the British political tyrants outlawed the private possession of firearms and most British subjects didn&rsquo;t object.  Now that the sheeple have effectively been disarmed they can and will be subjected to all manner of tyranny since this was the government&rsquo;s purpose of their subject&rsquo;s disarmament in the first place&hellip;   </p>

			<p>Formally, patriotic peoples were not deterred by the lack of firearms when the rightiousness of their cause was so overwhelming that it called for insurrection.  Firearms could always be obtained illicitly.</p>
<p>Nowadays, a lot more than traditional firearms can be obtained on the black market. The availability of biological and nuclear weapons abound in the underworld. too.</p>
<p>The latter, in sufficient quantities, are perhaps the only weapons that will cure the root cause of the problem although the host body may well have to run the risk of possible extinction itself.  Then again, what native inhabitant would want to bequeath a land of hostile alien invader breeds to his progeny that guarantees their slavery/genocide.<br>

With Kingsley Amis and Anthony Burgess already gone, we&rsquo;re losing all our great right-wing British novelists! Here&rsquo;s a fitting obit for George MacDonald Fraser   &mdash;   and his &#8220;reactionary views&#8221;   &mdash;   from the Torygraph: </p>
