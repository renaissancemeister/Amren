						<p>Australia will issue its first formal apology to the country&rsquo;s indigenous people next month, a senior minister said Wednesday, a milestone that could ease tensions with a minority once subjected to policies including the removal of mixed-blood children from families on the premise that their race was doomed.</p>
<p>The Feb. 13 apology to the so-called &ldquo;stolen generation&rdquo; of Aborigines will be the first item of business for the new Parliament, Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin said. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, whose Labor Party won November elections, had promised to push for an apology, which has been debated in Australia for years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The apology will be made on behalf of the Australian government and does not attribute guilt to the current generation of Australian people,&rdquo; Macklin said in a statement.</p>
<p>Macklin and Rudd have previously ruled out financial compensation for the impoverished minority, and Macklin did not mention that subject Wednesday. But she said she sought broad input on the wording of the apology, which she hoped would signal the beginning of a new relationship between Australia and the impoverished minority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s original inhabitants, Aborigines number about 450,000 among a population of 21 million. Aborigines are the poorest ethnic group in Australia and are most likely to be jailed, unemployed and illiterate.</p>
<p>Australia has had a decade-long debate about how best to acknowledge Aborigines who were affected by a string of 20th century policies that separated mixed-blood Aboriginal children from their families &mdash; the cohort frequently referred to as Australia&rsquo;s stolen generation.</p>
<p>From 1910 until the 1970s, around 100,000 mostly mixed-blood Aboriginal children were taken from their parents under state and federal laws based on a premise that Aborigines were a doomed race and saving the children was a humane alternative.</p>

			<p>What apology is necessary?  For whites to come to Australia, create a first-world country, and for the abos to have something of a first-world existence?</p>
<p>If there is &#8220;poverty, unemployment, illiteracy,&#8221; etc. among them, it might be because their average IQ is so low, and they are so bereft of intellect, that they couldn&rsquo;t figure out by themselves that human sexuality and pregnancy were linked.  The only found out because white people came and told them.</p>

			<p>As long as white people are apologizing for everything how about an apology to the continent of Antartica for our years of neglect?</p>

			<p>In Apartheid South Africa, the government did what the aborigines wanted to let them advance at their own paces governed by themselves and were heavily criticised.  In Australia, the government tried to advance the Aborigines to European levels and are now criticised.</p>
<p>Crazy,crazy world!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Aborigines are the poorest ethnic group in Australia and are most likely to be jailed, unemployed and illiterate.&#8221;</p>
<p>They still would be unemployed and illiterate if whites never settled Australia so what&rsquo;s changed? And the ones in jail aren&rsquo;t there for being aborigines. This reminds me of the argument made that taking American Indian children and putting them in boarding schools is equivalent to genocide. Had they been left with their tribes, the same people would have been whining about unemployment and illiteracy as in this article. With primitive indigenous cultures there are two choices: 1) educate them, which will destroy their culture or 2) leave them be, which will leave them illiterate and unemployed. <br>

			<p>Sure, the Austrailians should apologize to the Aborigines once the muslims who perpetuated the Cornulla riots apologize to them</p>

			<p>Once again blacks find a way to grift upon white guilt. The only way we will salvage Western Civilization is to stand-up to weak, socialist whites and drive them back under the rocks from whence they came. Not everyone will, or should survive. True White Power.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The apology will be made on behalf of the Australian government and does not attribute guilt to the current generation of Australian people,&rdquo; Macklin said in a statement.</p>
<p>Then they need to get into a time machine and round up some of the original Australian settlers and let them apologize themselves.  That is, if they felt there&rsquo;s anything to apologize for.</p>

			<p>First the apology and then the compensation. It is just the beginning of the newly elected socialist government&rsquo;s grand plan to give away all of our tax dollars to anyone that doesn&rsquo;t want to work or is just too dysfunctional from generations of welfare dependents.<br>
I would gladly trade our Australian Aborigines for your American Indians any day.</p>

			<p>Australia to apologise to Aborigines&rsquo;-does this mean that Aborigines are not classed as Australian, or can you now apologise to yourself? Are Asian Australians also included in  the apology?<br>
I have wondered the same thing with blacks/asians in Britain..we are asked to apologise for the slave trade/colonialism etc, does that mean that black and asian &#8216;british&rsquo; should be apologising for these things, too? </p>

			<p>It certainly does take on collective guilt. This is something that the left loves: creating artificial groups and saying that everyone in the group is exactly equal. <br>
This is exactly what the left does when it keeps a White, blue-eyed boy from going to the college of his choice and instead admits someone who has been classified as a minority.</p>

			<p>I am bemused that the Australian government would first take aborigine children away from their parents under misguided notions of &#8220;saving&#8221; them, and then decades later, pay them with nonaboroginal tax monies.</p>
<p>The best thing would have been to leave the aborigines in their forests, to hunt birds and kangaroos; not to Christianize them or have them live as Caucasians. Didn&rsquo;t they realize how stupid that is?</p>

			<p>Soprano Fan, you are saying what most rational people feel should be done with blacks and abos. Just let them be to live the way they want to live. Don&rsquo;t interfere with them and don&rsquo;t let them bother you. Let them go back to the savannahs, jungle, desert, or whereever they are from.</p>

			<p>With all this fuss about religion and god&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.take a good look around at how many stupid people there are&hellip;&hellip;.what kind of god would create societies of violent imbiciles.</p>
<p>Maybe god is in over his head, maybe he has given up, maybe he is dead, maybe he never was and never will be.</p>
<p>Anyway it is a freakin mess all over, and I see it getting much worse real fast&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Religious zealots of all colors are the root of all evil.</p>
<p>A small percent of people are evil.  There was a time when those were controlled by the normal ones.  Unfortunately the normal ones are being replaced by evil ones.</p>
<p>There is a very fine line between order and chaos.</p>
<p>Take a look at New Orleans during the hurricane.  Your community will be a free for all when the thugs outnumber the civilians.</p>
<p>There was a show with Clint Eastwood, I think it was Palerider, where he had the town folk paint the place red&hellip;&hellip;and named it HELL&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.when decent folk are afraid to stand up to the thugs&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;we are in big trouble and don&rsquo;t think there will be a champion on a white horse to come and save you.</p>
