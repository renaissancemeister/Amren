						<p>Charges that five boys raped a girl at Kingston High School Friday are sparking racial tensions in the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;This girl is just like Tawana Brawley, only she is white,&#8221; said the pastor of two of the boys, both black, who are charged with criminal sex acts against the 15-year-old girl. At least one of the other three boys is black.</p>
<p>Kingston police have charged the boys with sexually assaulting the girl in a boys restroom at the school about 3:30 p.m. Friday, after classes had ended. Two are charged with rape in addition to criminal sexual acts and one is charged with unlawful imprisonment. All of the charges are felonies.</p>
<p>In 1987, black teenager Tawana Brawley claimed six white law enforcement officers abducted and raped her in Wappingers Falls. The case touched off a national furor. A grand jury declared the accusations a hoax. In 2005, a black student&rsquo;s attack on a white Kingston High School student triggered a white racist demonstration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two of the boys charged at Kingston are Sharkey F. Daniel, 19, and his 17-year-old brother, Quami, both of 2204 Spring Brooks Village. They and their mother attend the New Jerusalem United Holy Church on Tremper Avenue.</p>
<p>The boys attend church several times a week, according to the pastor and Charlene LaDay-Hill, a minister, both of whom are black. Sharkey Daniel is a Sunday school teacher who won the Kingston district&rsquo;s Martin Luther King academic award last year, the women said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The brothers are due back in Kingston City Court today to secure their own lawyer. The other three suspects, also of Kingston, are scheduled for preliminary hearings in City Court tomorrow. They are Kory D. Rogers, 18, of 160 Bryun Ave.; Christian Moore-Giles, 18, of 121 Pine Grove Ave., and Tyler J. Bryant, 16, of 43 Gage St. They are being held at the Ulster County Jail on $25,000 bail each.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She [Pamela Tack, co-chairwoman of the districtwide Parents Council.] was not surprised by accusations against the girl in the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;They always blame the victim. Unless there are confessions, she is the one that is going to be on trial,&#8221; Tack said. &#8220;No means no, and that&rsquo;s it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Why would ANY white girl want to set up some black thugs by saying she was actually intimate with them? There are so many willing white girls out there that chase these thugs down it isn&rsquo;t necessary to do so. It MUST be rape! Ironic that one of the alledged rapists was an MLK award winner- can&rsquo;t write a better comedy sitcom script using the best comedy writers of our time for that one! And what is it with blacks having to be at least three in numbers to commit ANY crimes? Hello- anyone else notice this? </p>

			<p>It sounds like at least three of these so-called boys are 18 years of age or older, one is 19. So you have three adults having sex with a minor. The fact that they are still in school doesn&rsquo;t change anything.</p>
<p> If these guys like to play around in the boys bathroom I think they are in for a real treat.  </p>

			<p>  Until charges are made and a trial happens everyone needs to take a step back and not presume these guys are guilty. Does anyone remember the Duke rape hoax? Even if these boys are indicted they could still be innocent. The bottom line is the justice system will sort out this issue. I worry about Blacks not accepting facts and rioting if these guys are found guilty. If they do riot then I say put the rioters in jail. That kind of violence would reflect the destructive culture Blacks have adopted.<br>

<p>Yes - to any black males out there, please assume that it is alright to rape &#8220;white wimminz&#8221; because:<br>
1. It is &#8220;part of your culture&#8221;.<br>
2. Your ancestors were slaves/segregated/your-great-great-uncle&rsquo;s-friend&rsquo;s-brother&rsquo;s-son&rsquo;s-friend&rsquo;s-sister&rsquo;s-cousin was lynched.<br>
3. She &#8220;wanted&#8221; it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are good kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like the &#8220;good kids&#8221; that get sentenced to death because they shot an officer trying to arrest their brother (Hint:abu-Jamal)?</p>
<p>&#8220;They always blame the victim.&#8221;</p>
<p>She should apologise for presenting an enticing opportunity for the young black males to rape her.</p>
<p>Seriously, I hear the death-knell of White America.</p>

			<p>These activist never learn.  You have to wait and hear the evidence before you decide wheather it is false or true.  Even then, it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the truth.</p>
<p>In the Twanna Brawly case and in the Duke rape lie the evidence showed the charges to be lies.  In this case, the case is just beginning.  This distinction will always be lost on these activists.</p>

			<p>Well, well. Looks like the &#8216;Minister of Hate&rsquo; is out to play God, Judge, and Jury to get these young men a &#8216;pass&rsquo;. He may even succeed. The odds are that some of these &#8216;young men&rsquo; will spend time in prison, if they haven&rsquo;t been there already. Word travels fast about this type of crime in a prison. After being worn out by the MS-13 crowd, perhaps they&rsquo;ll enjoy a &#8216;different way of knowing&rsquo; about what rape is.  </p>

			<p>Another aricle talks about how they&rsquo;re good church going kids with impeccable character and then they mention one of the guys was already charged with robbery just a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re good kids - they&rsquo;re athletic, active in the church, they aren&rsquo;t in a gang, and we&rsquo;ve never seen them drinking or doing drugs,&#8221; the couple said. &#8220;They&rsquo;re not hoodlums.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another neighbor described the boys as having impeccable character.</p>
<p>However, Sharkey Daniels was charged Nov. 1 with burglary, a felony, following a break-in at a Downs Street clothing store. Another 19-year-old was also charged, but two or three others escaped. The charges are still pending, according to police.&#8221;</p>

Guaranteed this &#8220;church&#8221; has nothing to do with teaching the Bible and everything to do with pushing a black agenda. These so-called &#8220;churches&#8221; will have a lot to answer for one day. Just like Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;church&#8221;. BTW, I see that Obama&rsquo;s racist &#8220;church&#8221; has changed their website in the last week or so in an attempt to hide what they really are - BLACK RACISTS. Up until very recently this is what, according to their own website, they are all about - <br>
&#8220;Trinity United Church of Christ adopted the Black Value System written by the Manford Byrd Recognition Committee chaired by Vallmer Jordan in 1981. We believe in the following 12 precepts and covenantal statements. These Black Ethics must be taught and exemplified in homes, churches, nurseries and schools, wherever Blacks are gathered. They must reflect on the following concepts:</p>
<p>1.Commitment to God <br>
2.Commitment to the Black Community <br>
3.Commitment to the Black Family <br>
4.Dedication to the Pursuit of Education <br>
5.Dedication to the Pursuit of Excellence <br>
6.Adherence to the Black Work Ethic <br>
7.Commitment to Self-Discipline and Self-Respect <br>
8.Disavowal of the Pursuit of &#8220;Middleclassness&#8221; <br>
9.Pledge to make the fruits of all developing and acquired skills available to the Black Community <br>
10.Pledge to Allocate Regularly, a Portion of Personal Resources for Strengthening and Supporting Black Institutions <br>
11.Pledge allegiance to all Black leadership who espouse and embrace the Black Value System <br>
12.Personal commitment to embracement of the Black Value System. </p>
<p>NOW their website says this is what they&rsquo;re about - <br>
The Pastor as well as the membership of Trinity United Church of Christ is committed to a 10-point Vision:</p>
<p>1.A congregation committed to ADORATION. <br>
2.A congregation preaching SALVATION. <br>
3,A congregation actively seeking RECONCILIATION. <br>
4.A congregation with a non-negotiable COMMITMENT TO AFRICA. <br>
5.A congregation committed to BIBLICAL EDUCATION. <br>
6.A congregation committed to CULTURAL EDUCATION. <br>
7.A congregation committed to the HISTORICAL EDUCATION OF AFRICAN PEOPLE IN DIASPORA. <br>
8.A congregation committed to LIBERATION. <br>
9.A congregation committed to RESTORATION. <br>
10.A congregation working towards ECONOMIC PARITY. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out that they are now trying to tone down their blatant racism because one of their black racist members, Barack Hussein Obama, is running for president.<br>
 <br>
I love #4. - &#8220;A congregation with a non-negotiable COMMITMENT TO AFRICA.&#8221;  These creatures couldn&rsquo;t give a rats arse about America. Anyway, this kid supposedly being a &#8220;Sunday school teacher&#8221; is totally hollow and laughable. <br>

			<p>So any public demonstration in this girl&rsquo;s honor or defense would be a racist demonstration, while a Jackson/Sharpton one is seen as a continuance of the MLK &#8220;Dream&#8221; vision.  I remember that speech when it was made, and it filled me with dread.  We already had a lot of problems at my high school.</p>

			<p>&#8220;They are good kids.&#8221;, as the article so states.  That didn&rsquo;t take long. Such is the standard line soon after young black predators are caught.</p>
<p>The next line coming soon will most certainly be, &#8220;They&rsquo;re honor students&#8221;. Then the third comment from their defenders will  be, &#8220;racists want to lynch these boys&#8221;. </p>
<p>Thought I&rsquo;d get that out of the way so this story can play itself out.</p>
<p>I once worked as a probation officer for a predominantly black court district.  I won&rsquo;t name the city. </p>
<p>In one case, two young black men, brothers, were sitting on their front porch doing 40&rsquo;s (40 oz. hi-octane beers) and smoking doobies for most of the day.  One of the brothers was charged (and quickly convicted) of killing his brother (with a stolen pistol) because &#8220;he bogarted our last joint&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Sure enough, a black preacher, street punks and family members crowded the court lobby trying to tell anyone who would listen that &#8220;they were good boys&#8221;. It was a circus.</p>
<p>As I walked by, the preacher saw my badge and got in my face, almost yelling about what a good boy the killer was, and the court should know it(!).  I responded by telling the good reverend, &#8220;no he&rsquo;s not, he just admitted he killed his brother! He&rsquo;s not good in any sense of the word.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rev glared at me and stomped off, looking for another court staffer or media talking head who would listen and maybe even believe him.</p>
<p>In the years I was there, I witnessed scenes like this almost every week, and often, the hi level of predator support was almost beyond belief.</p>
<p>Ghetto blacks have no concept of &#8220;good and bad&#8221;, and they refuse to admit their numbers are awash in predators who prey mostly on   &mdash;   black people. They choose to almost deify their vicious progeny. By all appearances, this race has truly decaded into barbarism. </p>

<p>No, they only blame the victim if she is white and the rapists are black. Of course, these &#8220;good&#8221; boys would never commit rape, right.</p>

			<p>So, these five &#8220;boys&#8221; are 19, 18, 18, 17 and 16 years of age.  I don&rsquo;t know about NY state criminal law, but just making some assumptions, I would call them three men and two juveniles.  Many states like Missouri set 17 as the age of criminal responsibility, in which case it would be four men and one juvenile.  Honestly, I would rather call all five of them men than boys.</p>

Didn&rsquo;t you have to completely suspend your sense of reality to work with blacks? I would be curious to hear more of your experience with the black offenders and their families.</p>
<p>How come so many black criminals have awards, volunteer in their churches, and are good students? What kinds of institutions are these that their best are the dregs of society? Well, I keep forgetting they are black people.<br>

			<p><b>Rape charges, other felonies dropped in Kingston High School sex case</b> </p>
<p>KINGSTON   &mdash;   An Ulster County grand jury on Thursday dismissed rape and other felony charges against the six Kingston High School students accused of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl last week in a school bathroom.<br>
 <br>
In a decision handed up about 5:15 p.m., after two hours of deliberations, the grand jury opted instead to lodge misdemeanor charges of sexual misconduct and unlawful imprisonment against the defendants.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!&#8221; the mother of one of the suspects exclaimed at the Ulster County Courthouse after learning the most serious charges against her son had been dropped.</p>

			<p>Tawana and her fellow conspirators were trying to set-up a group of white police officers, not only to stir up controversy, but also in the hopes of suing the city. Just as the Duke stripper was counting on a big windfall from boy&rsquo;s family she falsely accused, while the prosector was looking to win a election. Hardly comparable to this. Besides, black males rape white females at an alarming rate in this country. While white males raping black females, is so rare it all but non-existant.</p>

			<p>Violet,</p>
<p>First of all, in my unedited post, I misspelled &#8220;decayed&#8221;.  My error and pardon me, please. </p>
<p>In working with black offenders, one learned quickly that the predator will never take responsibility for any part of his or her life to include their latest crime. They could be on video shooting someone and almost all of them will deny it&rsquo;s them on film.</p>
<p>And did you know that the guns they use in their crimes are different than those of law abiding people?  It&rsquo;s true if you listen to the predator. </p>
<p>Those that finally admit that they pulled the trigger (when cornered in an interrogation room by police) will say, &#8220;the gun accidently went off&#8221;.  Black killer&rsquo;s guns always go off accidentally. Bet you didn&rsquo;t know that. Even when their victim was shot 6 or 7 times. &#8220;The dude bumped my hand and then I heard, &#8216;boom, boom, boom, boom&rsquo;&#8221;.</p>
<p>One young black male who came through our system stabbed his girlfriend several times in the back, killing her.  His defense was, and I&rsquo;m not remotely making this up, &#8220;she fell on the knife&#8221;. </p>
<p>Yes, Violet, I had to shut down almost all reasoning when dealing with black and hispanic offenders and those that &#8220;love&#8221; them.  It was absolutely surreal at times. </p>
<p>Then there are the black mommas.  They always used the line: &#8220;I lost my son to the prison system&#8221;.  It was NEVER, &#8220;my son killed someone, beat someone half to death, shot someone, stabbed someone or robbed someone, and was then sent to prison because of it&#8221;.</p>
<p>Their &#8220;parenting&#8221;, whatever it was, raised the predator to be what he or she is, but momma being responsible for her actions? Never. Like momma, like son.   </p>

			<p>One could say this report is even-handed in that they talk about this recent rape and compare it to the Tawana Brawley incident from 1987. A lot of these reports bring up the &#8216;historical&rsquo; rapes in this country, and black women being victims of a racist society. This report doesn&rsquo;t do that. What they never bring up are the real historical facts concerning rape. Each year 20,000 white women are victims of sexual assault at the hands of blacks while only 200 black women are raped by white men. 2,000 white women are gang (by two or more black men) raped, while there are virtually 0 cases of the reverse. Considering the demographic breakdown of the population, a black man is approximately 700 times more likely to commit one of these interracial rapes. They are 100 times rob a white, 30 times more likely to assault a white, and 11 times more likely to murder a white person than is a white person to commit the corresponding crime against a black.  </p>

			<p>This alleged rape is certainly not as serious as the female Golf Channel analyst Kelly Tilghman who just got suspended for two weeks. </p>
<p>She was responding to another analyist who said  the only way younger players can beat Tiger Woods is &#8220;to take Tiger on, maybe they should just gang up for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kiddingly replied that they could, &#8220;Lynch him in a back alley.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guess who has come out of his hole to call for her firing?  Al Sharpton.</p>
<p>Yep, I can always rely on the great black leadership to respond to the true cultural issues hurting the black race-a white person saying something about a rope.</p>
<p>The incredibly high murder, rape, robbing, and llegitimacy rates compared to other races are of no concern.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most black people think this way. </p>
<p>Stories like these black on white rapes and murders I&rsquo;m constantly seeing are teaching tools for my family.  But, how do you tell your 5 year old girl to stay away from these people without her thinking you&rsquo;re crazy and dismissing you when she gets older?  I try and do my part but it&rsquo;s scary thinking she might resent you later on as kids do.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ghetto blacks have no concept of &ldquo;good and bad&rdquo;, and they refuse to admit their numbers are awash in predators who prey mostly on  &mdash;  black people. They choose to almost deify their vicious progeny.&#8221;</p>
<p>No they don&rsquo;t. The color of crime reports blacks commit more crime on whites than they do against other blacks. This is probably the exact reason they excuse and &#8216;deify&rsquo; their criminal element. </p>

			<p>One more, Violet,</p>
<p>All stigma has been removed from the so-called, &#8220;black community&#8221;.  Social rules, it was determined by black and white leftists way back in the sixties, were for white people because whites wrote them.  One example; unwed motherhood in the ghettos really became the norm along with limitless welfare benefits, no matter how many illegitimate children were produced. Blacks were taught to believe that there should be no restrictions of any kind in regard to their birthing decisions because such rules were a method of control or enslavement.</p>
<p>Healthy shame also has been eliminated in black communities.  Healthy shame works to keep us under control through our own sense of self-government.  To the majority of whites, for example, to act out criminally is to shame one&rsquo;s self and/or one&rsquo;s family. In other words, shame is the inner voice that says, &#8220;this is wrong&#8221; or &#8220;what would people think?&#8221; Appropriate self-government through healthy shame renders institutional government impotent.  </p>
<p>To feel shame, one also needs to respect the authority that governs an action such as how commiting adultry goes against the Ten Commandments.  In the ghetto, it&rsquo;s the &#8220;ten suggestions&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Now look for the respect of laws and the black perceptions regarding obeying them. So many blacks vote for a living, looking to extend the welfare state and entitlement plantation, but to obey simple laws?  That&rsquo;s for white people.    </p>
<p>Since the black mentality is to look at all authority in America as &#8220;white&#8221; in origin, no black, as they&rsquo;ve been conditioned, needs to feel a tinge of shame, no matter how destructive they are to themselves or others. </p>
<p>Does anyone remember when going on welfare was considered a mark of personal failure and, hence, shame producing?  Most whites still feel that way, but blacks demand those checks for as long as they breathe.  </p>
<p>The result of shame removal is that many blacks live by impulse and biological drives, and they&rsquo;ll condemn anyone who suggests they learn to adopt rules of decency and/or responsibility.  That&rsquo;s too &#8220;white&#8221; and, of course, the old standby, &#8220;racist&#8221;.   </p>

<p>DNA, Eyewitness, photo-evidence, it won&rsquo;t matter. This story will drop out of site once the facts are proven and ANY of the results convicting the blacks will either NOT be divulged or buried in a short paragraph in the bowels of the paper.</p>

			<p>White Americans have received outstanding return on their investment in multiculturalism and tolerance.  Only 40 decades and a trillion dollars after the end of segregation, we have achieved the happy state where a White girl can be engaged in sexual intercourse in a public school bathroom by six black boys simultaneously.  Meanwhile the black boys are viewed as automatically &#8220;not guilty&#8221; by virtue of their race regardless of what the girl says.  The girl could have been found beaten to a pulp and completely coated in semen and the black community would still defend the boys. </p>
<p>How proud White liberals must be when their daughters come home drenched in black DNA in this fashion - it is the ultimate proof of their leftist tolerance.</p>

			<p>I am sure you can all remember a few years ago, when the jury forman (black/female) in Washington, D.C. announced that she was &#8220;NOT going to send another black man to prison&#8221;. He was charged with having murdered with a handgun, several black residents of a public housing project in the stairwell. Even though the victims were black and poor, she was determined, no matter what the evidence presented, to prevent the conviction of yet another black man, and thus prevent him from being imprisoned. Obviously, the jury system does not work very well when the defendants are black and the jury is black.</p>
<p>In the case of OJ Simpson, the jury was one elderly black man, ten black women, and one hispanic female. As soon as the jury was selected, I told everyone the trial is OVER. We may as well turn off the cameras and go home now.</p>

The MSM doesn&rsquo;t consider this sort of thing to be newsworthy; probably because it is so common. But mark my words, this story will be systematically ignored and will disappear into the memory hole forever.</p>

That is so very true!  I have seen murderers brought into the station house, covered with blood, yelling:  &#8220;I did NOT stab her. This is a set-up. They PUT that knife on me!. I never touched the bitch.  She asked for it anyway.&#8221;   </p>
<p>Sure! Cops spend their time putting knives on people and smearing them with blood. Not to mention creating corpses in order to get poor, innocent Tyrone arrested for absolutely nothing.  It&rsquo;s just racism, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Such perps will make statements, and then 30 seconds later deny they ever said such a thing. They will insist that YOU&rsquo;RE lying. They will turn the tables and accuse you of setting them up, of beating them &hellip; of ANYTHING.  They are the most irrational, irresponsible bunch of people you can imagine.  Dealing with them is a nightmare.  And, of course, they are NEVER guilty of any wrongdoing!   </p>
<p>I realize that justice is not perfect and can sometimes go astray;  but if you interviewed prisoners, to hear them all tell it, every last person in prison in this country has been falsely accused and unjustly convicted. They don&rsquo;t take responsibility for their lives or their actions.   Nobody is EVER guilty of ANYTHING.</p>
<p>And yes, there are the hysterical black mommas, as Proactive said, whose sons are all &#8220;good boys&#8221; who&rsquo;ve been set up to fail by The System.  (No acknowledgement of their role in raising him.)  And then there are the [white] lawyers who come in to defend them   &mdash;  - I won&rsquo;t even go into THAT.</p>

<p>You bring up a valid point.  Hopefully, she&rsquo;ll understand some day (and not the hard way).</p>
<p>Any parent who fails to tell his child not to pet snarling dogs is guilty of negligent parenting.  Are you being unfair to dogs?   Are you &#8220;anti-canine?&#8221;   Maybe so.  Well, I&rsquo;d rather misjudge a dog, than have a dead or mauled child.  </p>
<p>Regardless of what you&rsquo;re incessantly told about  not &#8220;stereotyping people&#8221;, your first duty is to look out for the welfare of your child.  Anything else comes after that.  You have to use your own common sense, look at the statistics, and forget the brainwashing.</p>

<p>If so, I have found the perfect weapon to use against the few black males (talented tenth - work in sales) at work who are now chiding me about my fervent advocacy of Ron Paul (&#8220;I&rsquo;m an open-minded person.  You told me to google Ron Paul, I did and guess what I found?&#8221;)  Of course, just as the evil New World Order establishment media intended, he had come across the &#8220;New Republic&#8221; article.</p>
<p>What I intend to do if I can verify the original material is print it off but reverse the ethnic terms, and tell them it is from Ron Paul&rsquo;s church and ask if they see anything wrong with it? Why OF COURSE THEY WILL.  Then I will reveal the truth, and watch them squirm.  </p>
<p>I already asked if ANYTHING he ever purportedly wrote was worse than what many black conservatives themselves write.  I&rsquo;m &#8220;evading the question of Ron Paul being a racist.&#8221;  I asked &#8220;why the double-standards when the NWO media gave Senator Byrd a free pass for the last thirty years on his former membership in the clan?&#8221;  &#8220;I&rsquo;m evading the issue&#8221; I was told.  That&rsquo;s just the clincher I need.      </p>

<p>That is the definition of rape  &mdash;  unlawful imprisonment or kidnapping and sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>In other words, the Grand Jury was either cowed by the NAACP or else they actually believed the trumped up witnesses. The only other explanation is that the girl is mentally ill and it is therefore an even greater crime. Here in Minnesota, all sex with a mentally impaired woman is RAPE, no ifs, ands or buts about it. &#8220;Mentally impaired&#8221; includes drunk or high on drugs as well. That way, there is no &#8220;she wanted it&#8221; defense. Rape is a horrendous crime with very long lasting ill effects on the person who is victimized. Its fine by me that most rapists had accidents long before they got to trial in the old days  &mdash;  something they should go back to, IMHO.</p>

			<p>In many areas of North America the formal legal system has broken down and one can not get justice against Black criminals who rape, assault, terrorize our people. That&rsquo;s just the way it is. Understand the situation and deal with, don&rsquo;t whine. There are other ways. Staying clear of these people is the best way and keeping 15 year old White girls away from Black boys over the age of 11 is a good thing to do.<br>
Also understand that in all periods of our history with Blacks in North America there have been certain groups of Whites - usually lower on the class, education, social scale who &#8220;knew how to handle blacks&#8221; - they weren&rsquo;t scared of Blacks and they didn&rsquo;t get all hung up on legal restrictions, weren&rsquo;t worried about getting sued or having a New Republic article written about them saying they were &#8220;racist&#8221;. Now is a different time and there are different groups here. I note certain Hispanic groups are now fitting into that category of people who aren&rsquo;t afraid of Blacks and seem to know how to handle them, put them in their place. Let&rsquo;s get to know them. We can marry into Hispanic families, take some trips to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic see how the locals handle criminally minded Blacks who want to insult, rape Whites. I doubt the locals in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador are going to be spending all their time obsessing about the US Constitution and the Ron Paul campaign if there are Black rapists around. Let&rsquo;s keep good records and notate where these rapists live in say ten years.<br>

			<p>I happen to live in the Kingston area and can tell you this is not new. Last year a white student was beat down by another group of blacks for some issue regarding &#8220;respect&#8221; . The black of course became the victim. This too was big news at Kingston high and the police were on high alert for a so called race war between students because a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; was supposed to come to town to lead a protest. Of course it never happend because the &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; and his supporters were hounded and denied services wherever they went. I happen to know of a certain pub that shut down for the day rather then serve these guys. Real tolerant right? Kingston used to be a great town of mostly working class Irish and German. IBM was the big employer until they left. It is still nice in many sections, but the blacks who are STILL a minority have totally taken the once excellent high school and town over. Quite a shame considering Kingston has been around since the 17th century and served as the first capital of New York State.</p>

<p>Caveat:</p>
<p>The State Department advises tourists to stay within areas of the Dominican Republic where Dominican troops are stationed in an attempt to insure that the tourists are not victimized by local criminals, of which there are many.</p>
<p>According to a study by the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute, about 90% of the contemporary Dominican population has African ancestry or has African roots.</p>
<p>Below is a photo of a DEA fugitive from the Dominican Republic. He is obviously black, but note that the DEA designates his race as white.  The DEA, for reasons known only to them and other NWO enthusiasts, lists almost all, Dominicans as white no matter their actual racial characteristics.</p>
