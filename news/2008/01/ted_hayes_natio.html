						<p>For Immediate Release<br/>
Ted Hayes, Nationally Known Homeless Advocate enters 2008 Political Race.</p>
<p>WHO:<br/>
Ted Hayes</p>
<p>WHAT:<br/>
Ted Hayes enters 2008 political cycle as Candidate for Congress.</p>
<p>WHEN:<br/>
The Primary is set for June 2008 and General election set for November 2008</p>
<p>WHERE:<br/>
Los Angeles, California</p>
<p>Mr. Ted Hayes has entered the 2008 Political Cycle with a challenge to Congresswomen Maxine Waters for the United States House of Representatives, District 35.</p>
<p>Illegal Immigration and its impact on the Black America Community will be the center point of his campaign. Hayes who began speaking out against the negative consequences taking place in the Black Community over two years ago is not alone. A recent Los Angeles Times in-depth story reported that 2/3 of all American Blacks agree with Hayes.</p>
<p>More believed illegal immigrants had a negative impact on their community than those who viewed them positively. And blacks generally supported harsher enforcement measures, such as deportation and border security, than whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;In black neighborhoods, most of the folks I encounter are leery of immigrants and most have negative perceptions of them, unfortunately,&#8221; said Larry Aubry, columnist for the black-owned Los Angeles Sentinel and an executive committee member of the action and accountability group.</p>
<p>&#8220;But black leadership throughout the community has been frankly derelict in addressing this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is this Dereliction of Duty which Mr. Hayes will address with the voters in the District.</p>
<p>Although his positions against illegal immigration have been unpopular with pro open border-amnesty politicians locally, they have been heard on a National Level and have consumed the Presidential Primary Races commencing in Iowa</p>
<p>Candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have been forced to address the Illegal Immigration issue as have the Republican Candidates. It will be the impact on the American Black Community that Mr. Hayes will spotlight throughout the election cycle and will force all candidates to take a position in defense of American Blacks.</p>
<p>Mr. Hayes has maintained his defense of the Black American Community even in the face of threats to his safety.</p>
<p>Hayes will be holding local community Town Hall meetings to give a local Black Americans a venue to voice their concerns, frustrations and fears.</p>
<p>In recent months Mr. Hayes and a group of Los Angeles Black Americans journeyed to Washington to speak with Congressman Waters about the plight of Black Americans in Los Angeles as a result of Illegal Immigration. Waters refused to speak with the group and had Mr. Hayes arrested. He was charged with disorderly conduct. He pleaded not guilty and was acquitted.</p>
<p>A major fundraiser is being held for Mr. Hayes in Washington D.C. in early March.</p>

<p>It would have been nice if they could have left out the words &#8220;the Black&#8221; and &#8220;Community,&#8221; but I guess that would be too much to ask for.</p>
<p>I moved to LA in 1995 and South Central Los Angeles was all black. By the time I moved back to Boston in 2005, South Central was 85% Hispanic and renamed &#8220;South Los Angeles.&#8221; Immigration both &#8220;legal&#8221; and illegal is causing more harm to &#8220;black America&#8221; than it is to White America, thus far anyway.</p>
<p>The black leadership&rsquo;s dream of a black-brown alliance is just that - a dream. The average Hispanic despises blacks and if given a choice, vastly prefers the company of Whites over blacks.</p>

			<p>Hopefully Ted Hayes will beat her, but depending on the district, it will most likely too hispanic for him to have a chance.</p>

			<p>I wish him well because Maxine Waters has done her best to keep as many black people in Los Angeles in poverty that she could. Again, I&rsquo;ve witnessed this for years.</p>

			<p>Honestly, if Maxine &#8220;Running&#8221; Waters (an East St. Louis, Ill. native, BTW) loses her seat, it will be to a Hispanic.</p>

<p>Way to go, political queen of the mean and obscene Maxine!</p>
<p>How typical of that arrogant and miserable Red hag; I am surprised she didn&rsquo;t try and have Mr. Hayes shot, by some underworld gangbangers too?</p>
<p>Well, I know this guy is something of an unkempt and violent ghetto dweller himself, but that is what is likely to sell in Marxist Maxine&rsquo;s district; just look at her after all, she is one step away from the food stamps and malt liquor crowd. So maybe he will pull it off and do the House a favor?</p>
<p>Time will tell, but I wish him good luck!<br/>

			<p>I&rsquo;d contribute to Hayes&rsquo; campaign.  He seems to be less anti-white than Waters that&rsquo;s for sure.  It&rsquo;s about time someone dethrones that arrogant, Marxist racist!<br/>

			<p>Today I was reading a diary portion from the book Freedom Rider&rsquo;s Diary and a 14-year-old Hispanic boy was talking about a race war between latinos and blacks and he used the &#8216;n&rsquo; word.  From the story, it sounded as if the blacks were harrassing him and other latinos.  </p>

You say that like it matters.  Like black leaders have any loyalty whatsoever to blacks.  Let me tell you something about blacks.  No one is more racist than they are, against whites, against hispanics and against their own people.  Remember.  The slave trade was created and mostly maintained by blacks selling other blacks as slaves.  To Waters, Hayes is little more than a slave who should shut the hell up and do what he is told by his white masters + her, in the democratic party.  This attitude is the dominant one among democrats and always has been.  But, blacks are simply too stupid to see it, despite it constantly being rubbed in their faces.</p>
<p>And you are about to see the most dramatic example to date with Obama.  Never meant to be a legitimate candidate, he has slipped out of his cage and is on the loose.  Eventually, one way or another, he will be put back into that cage or killed (figuratively or maybe even literally).  It&rsquo;s going to be interesting to see if blacks are able to finally able to perceive Obama&rsquo;s real position and status among democrats.  I think they will.  And I&rsquo;m just breathless with anticipation to see the consequences.  I think by the end of the next election, we may see an end to the democrats as a viable party and a serious blow to the liberal power base in this country.</p>
<p>Now, if we can only elect an republican who isn&rsquo;t just a watered down liberal.</p>

			<p>  He seems like a good man to me. As a strict Roman Catholic, anyone whom truly advocates for the poor and promotes true economic upward mobility is alright with me. </p>

			<p>Like all those before him, Mr. Hayes will be betrayed by his own people because he insists they help themselves.  Even if the illegals are removed, blacks will still insist on quotas and handouts.  </p>

			<p>Like Thomas Sowell, I support many of mr. Hayes position. I feel we should form alliances with all those who see things our way on key issues. He seems to be a rather decent man who only means well-a true patriot. Blacks need to toss aside their allegiance to hate-mongers like maxine, Sharpton, and Jackson, just to name a few. However, we need much more leaders like Hayes to make this happen, or else, blacks will contine to be misled. All you white &#8220;purist&#8221;, need to understand where I&rsquo;m coming from.  </p>

			<p>Go Hayes! </p>
<p>If Dr. Ronald Paul (and probably Duncan Hunter) lose the presidential election, we need to start a new political party, called the American Nationalist party (if it doesn&rsquo;t exist yet; if it already exists, a merge of some sort, would be possible). It will transcend (disregard) race (for membership). I support it for principle and a larger base. The Party&rsquo;s main platform will be limiting (lessening) legal and illegal immigration, promoting trade protectionsim, protecting the Middle Class, and preserving the environment. Many Americans feel out of touch with the Democratic, Republican, and even Independent parties. There is a big vacuum; we have an opportunity.  </p>

			<p>Someone made a good point above.  White conservatives vilify and dismiss any white person that is openly pro-white or openly anti-black/anti-hispanic&hellip;.yet they&rsquo;ll allow a black or hispanic to be openly racial as long as it furthers their agenda.  For example, the Minutemen don&rsquo;t want any &#8220;racists&#8221; in there, yet, as this article points out, a black is allowed to join and say how illegal immigration is affecting the &#8216;black&rsquo; community.  Such hypocrisy.  I guess even white conservative men aren&rsquo;t real men like they used to be.   I sure wish most white conservative males, and white males in general, were like my grandfathers and before.</p>

			<p>Although Maxine Mugabe Waters is one of the two or three most    racist members of Congress, her racist anti-white views are what gets her elected in her district time after time.  Ted Hayes doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance there.  As much as blacks hate whites, they&rsquo;ll never vote for an anti-immigration candidate in my opinion since it favors them.  Remember - they think of themselves first and not America.</p>
