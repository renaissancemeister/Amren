						<p>Edgar Castorena had diarrhea for 10 days and counting, and the illegal immigrant parents of the 2-month-old did not know what to do about it.</p>
<p>They were afraid they would be deported under a new Oklahoma law if they took him to a major hospital. By the time they took him to a clinic, it was too late.</p>
<p>A ruptured intestine that might have been treatable instead killed the U.S.-born infant, making him a poster child for opponents of a bill months before it was enacted as the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act of 2007.</p>
<p>The law, billed by its backers as the toughest U.S. legislation against illegal immigration, took effect Nov. 1. It bars illegal immigrants from obtaining jobs or state assistance and makes it a felony to harbor or transport illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While it is difficult to characterize which U.S. state has the toughest immigration-related law, Oklahoma&rsquo;s goes beyond most because it includes the clause about harboring and transporting illegal immigrants, said Ann Morse, program director for the National Conference of State Legislatures&rsquo; Immigrant Policy Project.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The crackdown and its consequences</b></p>
<p>The crackdown has caused Hispanics to leave for neighboring states, with as many as 25,000 leaving northeastern Oklahoma alone, according to the Greater Tulsa Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The law&rsquo;s fallout also can be seen in struggling businesses, worker shortages and widespread fear among immigrants who say they are afraid to drive to church or the market because police might pick them up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like I&rsquo;m in some kind of Nazi country where if they see your color, you&rsquo;ll be stopped,&#8221; said Maria Sanchez, a 22-year-old student who is looking to leave Oklahoma rather than risk waiting the seven years it will take to get her papers. &#8220;I can&rsquo;t work, I can&rsquo;t study, I can&rsquo;t go out, there&rsquo;s no point of me staying here.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Defending Oklahoma&rsquo;s act</b></p>
<p>Supporters &mdash; described by Dan Howard, the founder of an anti-illegal immigration Web site, as &#8220;good, American, God-fearing people of the heartland that bleed red, white and blue&#8221; &mdash; say the law is necessary because of Washington&rsquo;s bungled immigration policy. They also believe the law has helped deter crime and punishes the companies that make money on the backs of illegal labor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Terrill [Rep. Randy Terrill, author of the bill] said there is no correlation between his bill and Edgar&rsquo;s death, noting that the child died in July, months before the law took effect, and that the law provides an exception for emergency medical care.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the extent that these illegal alien parents deprived their own child needed and necessary medical care because of their ignorance of the law, then they should be in prison, frankly,&#8221; Terrill said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Leaving Oklahoma all together</b></p>
<p>Even workers with proper paperwork are leaving for jobs in neighboring states rather than split up their families.</p>
<p>&#8220;My guy who runs my framing crew, he had 70 workers, and as of Nov. 1, he lost 35 of them,&#8221; said Caleb McCaleb, who runs a homebuilding company in Edmond. &#8220;My painter has lost 30 percent of his work force, my landscaper has lost 25 percent of his work force.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Know why it&rsquo;s so easy to find a dead or dying Mexican baby for this sort of propaganda?  Because so many of them die through the actions or inactions of their ignorant, border-jumping parents.  It&rsquo;s amazing anyone would value staying in America over the life of thier baby.  Are these the kinds of &#8220;strong family values&#8221; we&rsquo;re to expect from the invaders from Mexico?</p>
<p>GH</p>
<p>Oh, and the majority of the meth in America still comes from Mexico!</p>

			<p>If their 2 year olds life was really in danger, than not taking him to a hospital just for fear of deportation is neglect&hellip; even child endangerment.</p>
<p>And the businesses that lost employees&hellip; now they&rsquo;ll just have to hire Americans.</p>

<p>I think I read somewhere that there has been a scientific study done that has shown that consuming water from the Rio Grande, such as one might do if swimming in a direction towards the South, has shown a remarkable ability to lesson the frequency of many chronic gastrointestinal ailments, such as diarrhea.</p>
<p>Perhaps other AR readers have seen this same study and can help me with the details?</p>

			<p>Why isn&rsquo;t Caleb McCaleb in prison? Oklahoma should demonstrate some willingness to enforce their new law by going straight to the heart of the illegal alien problem. The employer magnet. McCaleb is exactly the sort of person who should be shunned by society and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

			<p>Every state should have this law.</p>
<p>The medical exception goes along with the idea of human rights that this country has always upheld. </p>
<p>If one is too scared to know the law, how could he live by it, and why would he want to be here? I can have no sorrow for lawbreakers, in the first place. </p>

			<p>Sounds like a good policy to me, despite the usual whining by the AP. I&rsquo;m sure if the parents of the 2 month old were back in Mexico where they belong, the kid would have died all the same, if not sooner.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope other states mimic Oklahoma&rsquo;s new bravery.</p>

<p>These parents have nobody to blame but themselves. They should have not been in the country illegally in the first place. In Mexico, they could have used Mexico&rsquo;s socialized medical system, which incidentally, would charge American parents up front before they would treat their child  if it had the same condition. However, they came to the US illegally and despite this, could have gone to the hospital emergency room where despite their illegal status, lack of money or medical insurance, they would have had their child treated free of charge. So what if they got deported, isn&rsquo;t your child&rsquo;s life worth more then the fear of being deported, I know mine would be!!!!!</p>

<p>  Any parent that loves their child is willing to risk their own welfare  &mdash;  even if that means returning to Mexico  &mdash;  to save their child.</p>
<p>Some &#8220;family values&#8221;!</p>

			<p>I live in Tulsa.We have the brown invaders on the run.Thousands have left the state and if ICE would stage a few big raids thousands more would leave.This legislation is very popular and Randy Terrill wants to beef it up.We have had it with our communities being turned into third world slums.This shows that politically active whites can be effective.The only bad thing is that many invaders have gone to adjacent states.We need strong national legislation.</p>

<p><br>
The parents should have been arrested and imprisoned (and then deported) for child neglect and endangerment.  They are criminal fugitives in a foreign country (ours) rather than at home, taking care of their child. <br>

			<p>Hmmmm. Makes me want to become an Okie! Good for them. I&rsquo;m sure they will turn into a mecca for those who want to live in a state that doesn&rsquo;t cater to illegals (and the resulting blight upon society that includes increased crime, crowded schools, and overburdened hospitals&hellip;).</p>

			<p>If every state had the exact same laws Oklahoma has in a very short time we would have the America the Founders intended back. And I have no sympathy for employers who depend on illegal labor. If they can&rsquo;t make a go of it by using legal Americans they are guilty of poor management and hiring practices and deserve to fail. Businessmen should be patriots too. </p>

<p>How truly sad.  Now they&rsquo;ll have to hire US citizens and pay a decent wage, instead of the slave wages they love to hand out.</p>
<p>And claims of labor shortages?  Pure bunk and there isn&rsquo;t an emmployer that doesn&rsquo;t know it.</p>

			<p>The law is &#8220;blamed&#8221; for hispanic exodus? I suspect this &#8220;exodus&#8221; is exactly the result those who voted this law into existence intended. It&rsquo;s called &#8220;democracy,&#8221; a difficult concept for post-Constitutional America, where every third-world peasant is assumed to have the &#8220;right&#8221; to help himself to residency and Subsidized Everything in the US.</p>

			<p>This is great for Oklahoma, but bad for other states that don&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t enact tough anti-illegal state and local laws.  All this means is that the invaders/colonizers will take flight for states with sanctuary city policies or pro-illegal such as Illinois.  </p>

<p>Karl, your political and sexual preferences are obvious.  I am from Edmond, Oklahoma and have met both Terrill and McCaleb.  McCaleb is a White, wealthy, real estate developer in the Edmond area that will probably never see any repercussions due to his local influence.  Rep. Terrill is an extremely educated and articulate lawyer who is a true, patriotic leader&hellip;unlike our (your) cultural marxist &#8220;leaders&#8221; in Washington.  Karl, your intellectual deficiency is indicated by your typical leftist slandering of your opponents as uneducated or crazed.  Therefore, I can promise you and the faithful readers of AR that Terrill would destroy you and your ilk in any debate.  </p>
<p>The paleoconservatives of Oklahoma fully hope and expect Rep. Terrill to run for higher offices and help to forestall the destruction of this country caused by decades of liberal, marxist programs.</p>
<p>Go Terrill, go! </p>

			<p>First of all, the deceased child&rsquo;s illegal parents should not have been in the U.S. in the first place.  Are we supposed to sympathize with people who don&rsquo;t even have the courtesy to ask a country for permission to enter? By comparison, here in Minnesota, I&rsquo;ve never known a single white person who crossed the Canadian border in either direction without cooperating with border police.</p>
<p>Secondly, mandatory medical care of non-paying illegal immigrants has resulted in the closing of many hospitals which can&rsquo;t afford to serve so many deadbeats.  The end result is that everyone suffers.</p>

			<p>Perhaps this article gives Americans a glimpse of the future for the way America could divide along racial lines. When the number of blacks and Mexicans reaches a critical mass, it would only take a few states to kick out them out and you would have a stampede of white Americans into the sanctuary of a white state. You are lucky to have so much space that this is an option: better to have half of America than all of nothing. Even in the white areas of England, it is hard to be more than 50 miles from a large concentration of &#8216;ethnics&rsquo; in other cities and towns, so there is really nowhere to get away from them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I think we cannot understand the way of life these people had in Mexico, so we shouldn&rsquo;t judge them so harshly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way of life these invaders lived in Mexico is the life they created for themselves by not standing up like men against a corrupt handful of criminals who have stolen all of Mexico&rsquo;s resources for themselves.  This cowardly groveling at the feet of their masters is why Washington wants to replace us with theses spineless third-world alien parasites.  They are far easier to control and pacify than Americans&hellip;       <br>
