						<p>ALMOST two million new homes will have to be built just to cope with the immigrant influx, peers will be told tomorrow.</p>
<p>It means 263 houses must go up every day until 2026 &mdash; the equivalent of five cities the size of Birmingham during the next 18 years.</p>
<p>Four in 10 of all new homes will go to new migrants, a report by Migrationwatch UK claims. Chairman Sir Andrew Green said immigration levels &#8220;are 25 times higher than at any time in nearly a thousand years of our history&#8221;.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;The economic &lsquo;benefits&rsquo; are trumpeted by the Government at every opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;But very little is ever heard of the costs, such as the huge addition to infrastructure requirements in order to build the millions of homes required for new immigrants.&#8221; The extra pressure on schools, transport and health services &#8220;will have massive ramifications for everyone living in this country for decades to come&#8221;, he added.</p>
<p>Migration into England will grow from 130,000 a year now to 171,500 in 2026, according to the Government&rsquo;s own projections.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew said the country is already very nearly the most crowded in Europe. &#8220;We cannot allow this to continue. Our objective now must be a broad balance between immigration and emigration,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The growth of the annual influx will see the number of new immigrant households rise from 73,000 now to 96,000 in 2026.</p>
<p>It means 263 new homes will be needed just for migrants every day &mdash; or more than 1.8million over the next 18 years.</p>
<p>New households overall will rise from 223,000 a year to 246,000. New migrant homes will account for 39 per cent of those.</p>
<p>The report concludes: &#8220;The overall economic benefit of migration is small and heavily outweighed by the implications of adding 18million to our population in the next 50 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The think-tank will present its findings tomorrow to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which is examining the impact of immigration, after evidence from Immigration Minister Liam Byrne.</p>
<p>Houses are allocated on a need basis, meaning immigrants are often more likely to be given a property as they are frequently newly arrived in the country with nowhere to live. In 2006 immigrants were handed 10,000 council homes worth £1.3billion, with the Government paying almost half that amount. The remainder was funded by housing associations and developers.</p>
<p>The Government&rsquo;s equality chief Trevor Phillips recently said the fear that migrants are jumping council queues for homes is fuelling tensions.</p>
<p>The Migrationwatch report also attacks what it calls the Government&rsquo;s &#8220;four favourite fibs&#8221; on the benefits of immigration. It dismisses claims that migrants are needed to fill 600,000 job vacancies &mdash; because around 900,000 people have come since 2001 but the vacancies remain the same.</p>
<p>It rejects suggestions that immigrants account for eight per cent of the workforce but contribute 10 per cent of gross domestic product, and attacks claims that immigrant earnings are 13 per cent higher than those of indigenous workers. And claims that our pensions depend on immigrants were rejected by the Lords committee five years ago, it says.</p>
<p>The report comes as around a million migrants gather on the coast of Libya planning a sea crossing to Europe, some hoping to head for the UK.</p>
<p>Of up to two million migrants living there, about half are using it simply as a staging post to get to Europe, the International Organisation for Migration will claim in BBC1&rsquo;s Panorama tonight.</p>
<p>Of the 30,000 migrants who made it from Africa to Europe last year, about two-thirds used the Libyan route.</p>
<p>There are growing fears that Labour&rsquo;s open-door policy is putting an increasing strain on already overstretched resources.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s population could virtually double in a lifetime due to soaring immigration and rising birth rates, figures showed last year. Numbers could top 110million by 2081, the Government Actuary&rsquo;s Department said.</p>
<p>The number of children born to Eastern Europeans in Britain has soared 100 times faster than those born to British mothers, figures showed in November.</p>
<p>The Daily Express told last week how one in eight pupils does not speak English as a first language after the number of non-English-speaking new pupils soared 50 per cent in just two years.</p>
<p>English is now the minority language in one in 17 schools.</p>
<p>The Home Office said yesterday: &#8220;There are legitimate concerns about managing some of the effects of migration on communities. We are listening to these concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is why we are bringing sweeping changes to the immigration system, including the introduction of an Australian-style points-based system so only those Britain needs can come to work and study. It is also why we are maintaining restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanians.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Migration Advisory Com-mittee is advising us on how migration can sensibly fill skills shortages.&#8221;</p>

			<p>No problem.  After the British are ethnically cleansed from their own homeland, there will be ample housing for the immigrants.  The British could rise up and fight to retain their homeland, but it&rsquo;s so much easier for the educated and affluent to run off to another country than to stay and fight.  For those who might say that the British have no guns with which to fight, matches are still available, are they not?  Which is worse   &mdash;   an England with parts of its cities burned down or an England populated by alien people?           </p>

<p>It is the vicerally hostile incompatible Africans that are the threat. (Other Europeans and Far East Asians and Hindu Indians and Latin Americans on the other hand blend with and adopt the host Eurpean cultures and are friendly to them and excell within them and so are not a problem at all.)<br>
Countries fight WARS to prevent being invaded by a foreign hostile culture. But the Leftwing elite totalitarian whites betraying Europe have opened the gates to the African invaders. They are bound and determined to commit genocide against the Eurpean peoples and cultures. Indigenous Europeans: NOW is the time to RISE UP and STOP and REVERSE the African invasion!</p>

<p>Better still, fill in the English Channel. Maybe the immigrants will drift over into France once all the food and money is gone in the UK.</p>

<p>One of the causes for this may be the fact, that in these two countries, a biggest number of Gypsies lives. And these are of the &#8220;wildest&#8221; variety, some still nomadic, living in the tribal style, getting married at the age of 11-12, etc.</p>
<p>Romanian Gypsies are already (in)famous in other countries for their tribal gangs, where women beg and steal and men wait for the easy income or engaging in more violent crimes.</p>

			<p>Historically, for manifold reasons mainly arising from the chronic uncompetitiveness of British industry, Great Britain (at least in the post 1945 period), has never been able to build sufficient housing for its inhabitants.<br>
Every Borough Council in Greater London, for example, has a &#8216;waiting-list&rsquo; for subsidised accomodation of a at least 20,000 people (there are upwards of 30 borough councils in London).Typically deserving tenants must stay on the waiting-list for periods averaging 5 - 10 years - a very harsh and parsomonious &#8216;points&rsquo;  system operates (&#8216;asylum seekers&rsquo; always top the list).</p>
<p>I would have thought that every concerned and aware Briton was well acquainted of this fact of British life.Especially &#8216;socialist&rsquo; MPs - who must have taken the route from local government in which bad housing is a very, very big issue.</p>

			<p>This is simply mind-boggling.</p>
<p>I personally know people who refuse to pay the price of a postage stamp, if they can get their stamp from someone else.</p>
<p>Given that selfishness is not an unknown or uncommon trait among human beings, how is it possible that a nation could ever be willing to provide infinitely more resources for the needs of outsiders and aliens to the utter neglect their own prosperity? How is it possible that people can actually be persuaded that their nation somehow owes a living to persons not even born there?</p>
<p>It might be understandable if they were building houses in the foreign lands whence these migrants originate, but the plan as proposed in this article seems entirely like something out of the Twilight Zone.</p>

			<p>There is only one solution and that is to vote for the British National Party which will end Third World immigration and restrict other immigration to acceptable levels to ensure a stable or slightly declining population.</p>
<p>As for the Romanian and Bulgarian gypsies, they are a very great problem in Western Europe. Italy has suffered a wave of horrific violent crime by Romanians. What the media have been quieter about is that these are mainly Romanian gypsies, not ethnic Romanians.</p>
<p>Here is a photo of gypsies in Bulgaria, as you can see they are not by any stretch of the imagination a European people. They came from what is now Pakistan and in their behaviour and appearance wouldn&rsquo;t look out of place in Pakistan, apart from their non-Islamic clothing.</p>

<p>PLEASE spare us honest citizens and voters that kind of cheap shot! Haven&rsquo;t you ever heard of voter fraud? Of &#8220;stolen&#8221; elections? Need I point to Florida in November, 2000 when Bush stole the White House. Or that equally bad-smelling vote count in Ohio four years later, letting him squeak in for an unwanted second term.</p>
<p>Gun control will always be the darling of the politicians. For damned good reason. Namely that an unarmed populace is easier to control. Less to fear from, than a hundred million thoroughly angry and well-armed citizenry. </p>
<p>Fine talk about &#8220;PUBLIC SAFETY demanding the relinquishing of gun ownership rights&#8221; is transparent, but guaranteed to elicit the support of gun control lunatic fringe groups and the controlled media. (That noble &#8220;public safety&#8221; sentiment NEVER takes into consideration that only an incredibly miniscule fraction of legitimate gun purchasers/owners are psychos and sociopaths like last May&rsquo;s Korean student. Stores relating how far more guns in private hands were successfully were used to hold off rapists, robbers, muggers and other criminals does NOT have much appeal for our CONTROLLED news media. Which is why we NEVER read or hear that kind of stuff in our daily newspapers and newscasts.</p>
<p>You might reflect that in the event of a massive armed uprising against a tyrannical government (ANY government), the military often would either side with the citizens or at the very least, stay out of the conflict. Since those angry citizen mobs might contain friends, relatives   &mdash;   people the military can relate to and sympathize with.</p>
<p>So, unless you&rsquo;re a shill for the establishment &#8220;Posted by at 9:55 AM on January 17&#8221;, kindly THINK before you post comments like that one.</p>

			<p>This is why the native brits are leaving in growing numbers for places like Australia and even here in the US. If immigration continues to grow here I pray that we let in more white Europeans to counterbalance our third world numbers. What is bad for Europe could be a boon for the USA. America and Australia, western cultures last best hope?</p>

			<p>The thing is that right now any citizen of Bulgaria or Romania can go to Britain without a visa, visas are only required for working there. As you can imagine this will stop only highly educated people from these countries who don&rsquo;t want to work illegally, while gypsies have gone there already - there is no work permit requred for begging. Off the point I can tell you that in Bulgaria the liberals are pushing so hard for foreign labor force that it&rsquo;s ridiculous. Everyday some &#8220;business organization&#8221; tells us in the news they need Pakistanis, Chinese or Filipinos working in Bulgaria and the law that forbids companies from hiring foreigners should be changed. I expect in ten years Bulgaria will be full of third worlders and all the British retired people who bought houses here will be leaving.</p>

			<p>You have to wonder if they are just doing this for votes, like the Democrats want to, to &#8220;stay in power&rsquo; forever. Of course, conservative and moderate dems will just move over to a moderate sane republican candidate, and minorities have less voter turn out.

			<p>But, Fed Up, the two main parties in Britain are both left wing parties.  That poster is correct.  The British keep on voting for the same loopy policies.  By a comfortable margin.  If a significant percentage of white British really wanted change, the BNP would be getting a heck of a lot more votes.  It isn&rsquo;t.  So we&rsquo;re faced with the fact that a significant portion of the British white voter is either stupid, uninformed, or satisfied with the status quo.  I think the latter and I believe they are headed over the cliff.</p>

			<p>This dreadful situation has arisen in Britain due to the success of the Far Left&rsquo;s propaganda and intimidation.  The British have been told for the past 50 or more years that to be proud of their country, their race, nation, culture etc is immoral, the worst kind of evil, because thats what Hitler was like. If anyone expresses even the slightest disaproval of another foreign culture or race they are immediately labelled Fascists and Nazis, Xenophobes and the like. Worse still, under new legislation they can now lose their jobs or be jailed. Many people in the Public Service cannot admit to loyalty to the BNP (the Nazi Party don&rsquo;t ya know!) let alone be members.  Social stigmatization of themselves and their children at school is another price they have to pay. You cannot imagine how indoctrinated the British have become. Fifty years of relentless propaganda has done it&rsquo;s job.<br>
  This hateful attitude towards Nationalism, love of country and race is alive and kicking here in the States as well, but fortunately America has a Constitution that guarantees people&rsquo;s freedom of expression. Nevertheless, The Liberal are never ones to let an opportunity to control &#8216;the masses&rsquo; slip by; we all know about the intimidatory tactics used by college professors to silence any Nationalist or Conservative views on Campus. Just look at the placards of the marchers who support the Hispanic invasion, which is similar to Britains 3rd world invasion, they are awash with slogans denouncing folks like us as Racists, Haters, Facists etc and just look at how the hectoring mobs on the Far Left love to call President Bush a Nazi or Hitler, he&rsquo;s not even a particularly Conservative president. This is what has silenced the British, no-one wants to be compared to the most evil regime in history.<br>
 Constant repetition of an obvious lie will eventually begin to establish a familiarity that then becomes a truism. To those power-crazed individuals whose need to control is thwarted by the electoral process, name-calling, shouting and abuse seems to be a cathartic experience, an opportunity to release their deranged vitriol towards anyone who is not with them. It&rsquo;s all about power and control. <br>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;They keep on voting the same bosses in again and again, with their support of gun control and ever more diversity, so, obviously, they must want this.</p>
<p>Posted by at 9:55 AM on January 17 </p>
<p>I can see why people would think this way, I&rsquo;ve noticed several posts here and elsewhere baffled by the British people&rsquo;s continual re-election of &#8216;more of the same&rsquo;. As I&rsquo;ve pointed out in earlier posts,(and here still pending)the British people have been indoctrinated, intimidated and silenced by the bully PC tactics and propaganda of the Far Left who have infiltrated all aspects of British society from government to media education etc. And yes, it&rsquo;s taking off here in the US so don&rsquo;t feel too complacent and believe that it won&rsquo;t happen here. It will. The Left knows no boundaries when it comes to seeking power, they will side with anyone, and right now, as we all know its Islamists. But at least you have guns and more free speech than Briton.</p>
<p>As to why the British keep voting these nation wreckers in, well in a &#8216;first past the post&rsquo; Democracy its the one with most votes who wins. Up until the past decade the choice was between the Conservatives, who feebly attempted to stem 3rd world immigration and of whom J.Enoch Powell was the most outspoken -  he was sacked even though he had massive public support. The other choice is Labour who have been thoroughly infiltrated by Marxists and then there&rsquo;s the Liberals, Leftwing ditherers who are known as the Woolly Party. The BNP is the respectable outgrowth of the National Front whose front line troops were Bovver Boys in Doc Marten Boots and shaven heads,ie thugs. It is Labour&rsquo;s ceaseless tirade against Mr. Nick Griffin&rsquo;s association with the former NF that stops people voting, but it will only take a few brave but recognisable national figures to change all that. Patience is required.<br>
As to why the British no longer have guns. 1920&rsquo;s Cabinet papers released in the 1970s reveal that it was not fear of supplying the IRA with weapons, rising crime or the like  It was fear of a Bolshevik uprising similar to that in Russia, and that alone that convinced the Government to disarm the public.<br>

<p>Sorry, Xenophon, you probably are correct. Admittedly, I was comparing the British government to ours. Stolen elections and all.</p>
<p>If the BNP fails to get the requisite votes, why not blame it on the real reason&hellip; that the Brits have been so thoroughly brainwashed since 1945 that they accept the idiotic MYTH OF RACIAL EQUALITY! I recall one English friend pointing out to me that dare an Englishman say ANYTHING considered derogatory to the immigrants, regardless how true, that person gets ridiculed for demonstrated racism.</p>
<p>Having visited England on several occasions, I truly sympathize with the &#8220;common man&#8221; seeing his country degraded and destroyed by the influx of Blacks, Muslims and other primitives. I&rsquo;ve said it before, but repeat it: The destruction of England which neither the Spanish Armada, Napoleon, or Hitler could not achieve, is today being done by its worthless anti-England government officials.</p>

<p>The Roman Empire lasted much longer than America has been in existence and when they finally did lose their Empire they still kept their country.   Our Constitutional Republic form of government is new to the human experience and all the forces of evil have been brought to bear upon it.  As long as America remains free it poses a threat to the communist goal of a global totalitarian police state.  If America falls all mankind will enter into a political dark age too horrible to contemplate&hellip;     <br>

<p>Xenophon and Fed Up both, the Conservative Party in Britain is not Left wing. It&rsquo;s Conservative and feebly tries to be Right wing; admittedly it has drifted to the centre but I&rsquo;d never say it was Leftist/Socialist. Compared to the Republican Party it could be interpreted as such and it&rsquo;s all relative I guess, but hardly a soul in the UK who votes Conservative would ever consider themselves Leftists. You are correct however when you say that the reason for Briton&rsquo;s voting habits are due to Leftwing Propaganda and intimidatory tactics, see my posts above.</p>
<p>Also why do you think British elections are rigged? I&rsquo;ve only ever heard of rigging one time up North in the Muslim ghettos where they just write names in of the guy they want. Do you have any evidence from your visits of election fraud?  You sound as though you really want the Democrats to take power in the US, Al Gore, John Kerry et al (which makes me wonder if you are the real Fed Up or a troll). Here&rsquo;s some of Gore&rsquo;s immigration stances:<br>
- Al Gore denounced Proposition 187, which was a California ballot initiative posed to &#8220;deny all social services, including medical and educational programs for children, to illegal aliens residing in California. Gore called the prop a &#8216;nuevo [new] apartheid.&rsquo;&#8221; (how nice of him, more Leftist namecalling!)</p>
<p>- Al Gore supports the Amnesty proposal, which would allow certain long-term illegal immigrants to become legal residents.</p>
<p>- Gore supports medical and nutritional assistance for immigrants, as well as protection for legal immigrants who become disabled. He also supports welfare for legal immigrants.</p>
<p>- He has also worked extremely hard to improve educational opportunities for immigrants.</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t think a Leftist with those attitudes is going to help us down here in Texas, or anywhere for that matter because the Democrats traditionally welcome illegal immigrants, want to give them drivers licences, etc. <br>
 You sound as though you are really really angry (still) at the election results 2000 and 2004, presumably because they didn&rsquo;t produce a Leftwing president!?!. Not that George Bush is much better, but I&rsquo;d sooner have him than Kerry or Gore.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know if you really are &#8216;Fed Up&rsquo; but if so then I&rsquo;m quite surprised at your attitude towards the Democratic process both here and in the UK. I found your post a touch confusing.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a member of about four political forums in all and Assistant Manager of one. </p>
<p>I delight in rattling the cages of Cultural Marxist goats.  (My favourite hobby as far as the Internet is concerned.)</p>
<p>There is one such forum in particular which does not censor what people say providing no racial epithets are used.  On there, you can take the Marxist sludge apart without hinderance.</p>
<p>Of course, this frequently causes gang-ups usually comprising of about five of these cretins at a time which, although it&rsquo;s hard work taking on that many, often close together, it&rsquo;s enjoyable because I see it as an ongoing campaign of targeted dismantlement of the Cultural Marxist ideology and its associated Marxist philosophical base.  You have to be relentless and I have composed several hard-hitting names which and if asked to explain what any of them mean, it&rsquo;s almost guaranteed to send these mindless morons into a tailspin.  The more they spin, the more I jab them.</p>
<p>One upstart, in particular that I would be quick to eject off my forum for its arrogance, has tried enlisting the help of five of the thing&rsquo;s Marxist cackler (noise polluter) fiends -  oops, friends, to get me banned without success, needlesstosay<br>
 <br>
Luckily, there is a safe sprinkling of other nationalists aboard which aids the necessary moral support all round.</p>
<p>Someone, wrote on another Amren thread just recently that  Liberals can feel their approaching demise.  I agree!  Most White Nationalists, I suspect, can also feel their mounting fear which is evident in ideological exchanges with them.  I know, I can.<br>

			<p>&#8220;I have yet to hear an environmentalist talk about immigration. I guess being sensitive and not offending immigrants is more important than preserving the environment by keeping the population at a reasonable level.</p>
<p>Posted by Frank K at 2:50 AM on January 17&#8221;</p>
<p>This is precisely why I gave up on the environmental movement. I started college in 1977 and got a biology degree because I loved wildlife and wanted to do something to help wild creatures and save their habitits. When I graduated in 1981 I realized that everything had changed. The environmentalists were nothing more than a bunch of left-wing loonies. I suppose the change had been taking place before and I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it. However, by 1981 you would have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to see it. </p>
<p>I still love nature and wildlife. It&rsquo;s a tragedy that the whole movement has been taken over by the loony-tunes left.  </p>
