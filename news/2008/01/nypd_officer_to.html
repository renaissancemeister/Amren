						<p>A New York City police officer has been arrested on charges of raping a 15-year-old girl, authorities said.</p>
<p>Trent Young, 39, of Middletown, N.Y., was arrested in his home Thursday morning, police said. He faces charges of second-degree and third-degree rape.</p>
<p>Young teaches karate at the Iron Tiger Martial Arts Center in West Milford, N.J., and at his home. The girl was his student, police said. Young allegedly abused her in his home and at the martial arts center.</p>
<p>Police said the abuse started when the victim earned her green belt in 2005. That day, Young had the girl sign an oath of obedience and then took her to another room, where he told her to remove her clothes until she was naked, police said.</p>
<p>Young then sexually abused her, police said. After she put her clothes back on, Young told her it was all part of a test, according to police.</p>
<p>In 2006, Young allegedly pressured the girl to have sex, continuing to say that doing so was part of the oath, police said. Young and his alleged victim had intercourse between 20 and 40 times until October of 2007, police said.</p>
<p>Young told another female student, also 15, to remove her clothes as part of an oath, but she refused, investigators said.</p>
<p>According to the Iron Tiger Martial Arts Center&rsquo;s Web site, Young taught in the New York City school system for seven years before joining the NYPD. The Web site also says he has trained thousands of students in martial arts.</p>

					<p>With this karate teacher, a chastity belt was more desirable than a black belt.</p>
<p>What gets me is that this young woman complied with his &#8220;obedience training&#8221; for two years.  Yet the next one he tried this scam on another girl, and she refused both the disrobing and the sex.  This means the first one didn&rsquo;t quite grasp the perfidy of her teacher&rsquo;s actions.</p>

					<p>This unfortunate girl&rsquo;s parents possibly encouraged her to study martial arts so that she could protect herself against rape.</p>
<p>Not that this sort of predatory behavior never happens among just whites, but letting one&rsquo;s white teenage daughter study martial arts in the home of a black martial arts instructor?  &mdash;  I wonder if her Dad had a moment of doubt, but dismissed it as &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

					<p>A generation ago, my aunt and uncle and cousins moved out of New York City to Middletown to escape from the brown stain that was then creeping gradually over the city. So did many thousands of other whites who thought they had found a refuge in places like Middletown. </p>
<p>My cousins moved out of New York after my the brother of my cousin&rsquo;s fiance&rsquo;s shot, at ramdom, by a drunken, angry Cuban who walked into an Irish bar and just opened fire on white people. They said that was enough and left.</p>
<p>At that time, places like Middletown and Milford were all white.<br>
Now look what&rsquo;s living up there with them!  And preying on them. All over again!</p>
<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t say it, of course!, but I&rsquo;ll bet anything that young girl was white.  These are the problems and the people her family moved up there to get away from. I&rsquo;m sure. That area is all populated with ex-New Yorkers who fled the city&rsquo;s brown blight. It seems you just can&rsquo;t get away from them for more than a few years of peace before it starts again.   </p>

					<p>&ldquo;Young then sexually abused her, police said. After she put her clothes back on, Young told her it was all part of a test, according to police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This type of manipulative behavior, is the trademark of the sexual predators who prefer victims that are underage. Set up a scenario that requires trust or admiration, demand secrecy, and then engage in their twisted lusts. It is almost always the same.</p>
<p>Regardless of race, these perverts rape on all levels: emotionally, physically, and psychologically. They destroy the innocence and confidence of children. They should be dealt with accordingly, prison for life without parole; or better still, the guillotine.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

					<p>All I have to say is Young had better not be a member of any legitimate martial arts tradition.  The practitioners of the real stuff are extremely touchy on matters of honor, especially with regard to formal association with their school.  He&rsquo;s likely to be hunted down and dealt with.  Then, there is the small matter that he is a cop&hellip;.most likely going to prison.  That will be&hellip;unpleasant.</p>

<p>His victim might be black, but that is extremely unlikely.  This is a typical case, I think, where a black, comes to a white neighborhood specifically for white victims.  In other words, this isn&rsquo;t just a rape.  It&rsquo;s a hate crime.</p>

<p>Indeed.  Then again, when have frauds ever been loved by those whose names they offend? If he is a member of something real (which I&rsquo;d like to doubt), they will only be first in line.  Most likely, they will- out of respect for the law - let the law take it&rsquo;s course. </p>

					<p>Anyone who rapes a child should be executed, no second chances.  Why even consider giving someone a second chance to rape a child?  I don&rsquo;t care what color they are, they need to be put in prison for a year in general population, then executed in some old fashioned way.  I&rsquo;m all for chemical castration too.  As long as the chemical they use is gasoline!</p>

<p>You comment is very callous.  <br>
Anyway, regardless of her willingness, that&rsquo;s completely irrelevant.  Legally, even if she begged him for it, sex with such a minor is still Statutory Rape, period.  As a police officer, he if anyone, would be aware of that. He knew what he was doing.</p>

<p>Thanks for those stats.  I&rsquo;m sure that a few decades ago the area was 100% white, but  now it&rsquo;s &#8220;changing&#8221;.   He&rsquo;s the 1% who&rsquo;s got his foot in the door.  And now just check back in 20 years!</p>
<p>Also, for the record, he works at the 26th Pct.  which is on 126th Street <i><b>in Harlem. </b></i>  Why doesn&rsquo;t he live there too?   Instead, he live in Middletown which is 85 miles away!!!   <span class="caps">NYC </span>is trying every incentive (even housing subsidies) to get its officers to live in the city.  It&rsquo;s obvious why white cops no longer want to live there.  But this guy would be among his own people and would get favored treatment for it. But clearly, he prefers to live among white people.   </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be blunt:  raping teenage white girls is a hate crime directed at the white race.</p>

					<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes the perpetrator was a black male or a white male made up to look black. There is something wrong with this report. The only answer I would seek is, what did the white man do to cause him to do this? But then again he has the badge and gun so he isn&rsquo;t even bound by the same laws we are, is he?</p>

					<p>A really good Affrimative Action African lawyer only needs to point out that white racism is the motivation of these charges against him. A good Affrimative Action Lawyer only needs to point out that he is black and thus is a victim of white lynching tactics.</p>

					<p>This young girl in this article seems to have been led to believe that martial arts training has some magical aspects to it by believing that this black was going to impart some kind special knowledge to her.  I mean, doesn&rsquo;t <span class="caps">T.V.,</span> Hollywood, and all the people in the business always make these claims?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in favor of martial arts training for all women, but I think it&rsquo;s important to emphasize its limitations, because to be effective, like any other fighting, it still takes speed, strength, and size to really be effective, though I believe the training can enable women to get in a punch or two against a male attacker that may allow her to escape.  And on an equal one on one, woman against woman; man against man, the well-trained martial arts student will more than likely win.  But it offers no magical qualities as those who love to fantasize about it and earn money from it claim.<br>
 <br><br>
If this girl had been adequately informed as to the pluses and minuses in an honest way I seriously doubt that this black could have fooled her. </p>
<p>Martial arts training for women is misrepresented to a great extent by these people who tell their young women trainees that they can whip most any man, once they&rsquo;ve reached a level of expertise, and that there are &#8220;secrets to be learned.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s a farce in that respect.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m going to be laughed at by relating this experience, and it&rsquo;s a bit off-topic,  but it tells a lot about karate in general, and in that regard IS relevant to the above report.</p>
<p>My girlfriend took Karate training four nights per week for four years and believed it when she was duped into thinking she could annhiliate any man who was inexperienced in martial arts, just like Hollywood depicts constantly.</p>
<p>She got really heated at me once for guiding her out of my house through the front door in response to an argument we were having.    When we were on the ground she turned, assumed the standard Karate position for fighting, gave me a kick to the groin, which missed the vial parts and hit my lower stomach, then followed with a karate smash to my face with the heel of her hand.  </p>
<p>Before I knew it, I instinctively threw a fast punch in her direction which knocked her flat on her back.  She got to her feet, her eyes were crossed and glazed, she was wobbly, looking as if she were going to go down again on her own, but she stayed upright, alternating between holding the limp hand she had struck me with and holding her jaw where I had hit her, and she was limping on the foot she kicked me with.  All the while she was lamenting that now she was going to have to go to the doctor and that she was going to phone the police to let them know I &#8220;beat up on her.&#8221; </p>
<p>When I turned my back on her to go into the house, she struck out at me again, on the back of my neck, with her good hand, and I almost instinctively swung in response again, but checked myself this time.  When she realized she did no harm,  she walked out to her car, shaking her other hand, limping and crying, and I thought to myself I wonder if she understands <span class="caps">NOW </span>that she&rsquo;s been duped for four years.</p>
<p>The answer to that came later when we had made amends, were on our way to dine out, when I had to stop and run into the store for something.  It wasn&rsquo;t a great neighborhood, so I told her to lock the door after I got out.  She said, &#8220;No, I&rsquo;m going to leave it open and hope somebody tries something.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably already guessed that she&rsquo;s a bona fide, dyed in the wool liberal, and a rabid feminist to boot.  How we ever got together in the first place I&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>I say encourage our women to take defensive training, but level with them on what to expect that they&rsquo;ll be able to do.  I believe it&rsquo;s criminal to misrepresent what it&rsquo;s all about, and could be, as in this case, very dangerous.</p>

					<p>Can anyone on this board imagine a thirty nine year old white cop repeatedly raping a fifteen year old black girl? Or any girl for that matter? </p>
<p>What barbarism. </p>

<p> This poster makes a good point. The Martial Arts have been sold to a gullible public like a load of used cars. If you are going to study them, employ the <span class="caps">KISS </span>(keep it simple stupid) principle. Concentrate hard on just a <span class="caps">FEW </span>key moves and learn them very well. Even then be realistic about your capabilities. There is nothing more dangerous then a false sense of security. This message is posted with all due respect to practitioners of the Martial Arts.</p>

					<p>What woman needs &#8220;Martial Arts&#8221; training when one can pack a pistol in a purse? Every white woman <span class="caps">MUST </span>own a gun or in my opinion she is one stupid person. </p>
<p>America is not safe for white women.</p>

					<p>While we&rsquo;re talking stats - Middletown, NY where this thug lives, is in the throes of a massive demographic shift toward an ever more Black and Brown complexion! I grew up in this area and know it well. I recall a time, back in the 70&rsquo;s or 80&rsquo;s when Middletown had basically that one typical Black &#8220;area&#8221; which was one street and a few blocks in size. Since the 90&rsquo;s and especially in the past ten years, the flood gates have opened and the whole city/town has changed dramatically for the worse. Crime has skyrocketed and the schools are a mess! <br>
America is rotting away, one town at a time&hellip;</p>

<p>Because he can&rsquo;t afford $2,000 a month for an 800 sq. foot box?</p>

					<p>One word will restore this bastard&rsquo;s honor&hellip;but it&rsquo;s doubtful that he will understand it, given the truth of &#8220;Ranger&rsquo;s&#8221; post, above.</p>
<p>I am six feet, 200 lbs, and used to be in fairly decent shape. i took martial arts classes until the lack of spots medicine knowledge on the part of the instructors caused me to get injured. (Guys just aren&rsquo;t designed to do &#8220;the splits.&#8221;) One of the students there was told to spar with me. She was 5&rsquo; 0&#8221;, 120 pounds and told me that she was scared to death to do it. I now realize she was right to be sacred.</p>
<p>But I digress. The word that will restore the bastard&rsquo;s honor?</p>

Don&rsquo;t be silly.  Do you think people in Harlem pay that kind of rent?  There are plenty of affordable apartments in Harlem, but whites cant live there, not because of the cost but the crime.</p>
<p>And besides, as said above, he is also eligible for a rent subsity, as a cop, that someone else would not get.<br>

					<p>Viewing this hapless buffoons picture he is oozing narcissism. He purposely moved up to that white town looking for niave white females,the younger the better.Ever the schemers useing that hokey karate school as a front and his cover as a <span class="caps">NYPD </span>officer. Ol Trent is in love with himself and amazed at how dumb ( in reality innocent ) these small town white gals really are.Once again an endless supply of white womanhood slowly is defiled by the predations of the Trent Youngs esconsed in every part of post America. Which way Western man ?</p>

Thank you, McGraw.  It&rsquo;s ludicrous that his apologists would attempt to claim that he can&rsquo;t afford to live in Harlem!!!   Poor thing.  Among all those millionaire blacks, you know! </p>
<p>No, he had to move 80 miles away to find something affordable.<br>

					<p>&#8220;And in West Milford, there is a good chance these girls were White, as it is very Caucasian by Jersey standards.&#8221; Posted by HH at 6:13 PM on January 2 </p>
<p>Yes indeed. This fits <span class="caps">YET ANOTHER </span>one of the sickening black <span class="caps">PATHOLOGICAL </span>patterns. We saw this same sort of thing in Kansas City Kansas where a black law-enforcement officer was using his position of authority to rape Hispanic migrants (knowing they&rsquo;d be afraid to report the offenses). We also saw this where black Army sergeants in boot camps were using their positions of authority to force white female recruits to submit sexually to them. (And in the latter case you&rsquo;ll remember some years back when a whole long series of these scandals came to light, as usual, the black supremacists like in the <span class="caps">NAACP </span>tried to portray the <span class="caps">BLACK SEXUAL PREDATORS </span>as the victims of racism! Why? Because IN <span class="caps">EVERY CASE</span> IT <span class="caps">WAS</span> A <span class="caps">BLACK PERPETRATOR AND WHITE VICTIMS</span>! They could not point out any examples of white perpetrators or black victims. Don&rsquo;t even try to figure out the tortured mentality of black <span class="caps">NAACP</span>-type racists.)</p>

<p>Obviously he had to move to a low-rent white neighborhood,  a big step down I&rsquo;m sure, Harlem and the Bronx being beyond his means.   </p>
<p>That 160 mile a day commute, and having to put up with those awful white people and all their racism must have been a real hardship.   Poor guy.  But what can a poor, oppressed black man do?</p>

The ignorance is frightening. </p>
<p>Both for the ignorance of the statistical trends of blacks, plus the whole martial arts thing for women.</p>
<p>If a women wants to defend herself, get a goddamned gun (like my dad bought my sister for Christmas), or at least a taser or stun gun. Or at the very, very least, just teach them to kick hard (and to aim it at the balls), then run, run, run and scream, scream, scream.</p>
<p>My girlfriend fell into the martial arts trap, having done it for like 10 years. And, she&rsquo;s athletic and strong for a girl. And, it did serve her well when 5 black girls attacked her. </p>
<p>But, she got quite a lesson when she challenged me to spar (I&rsquo;ve never been formally trained in anything (but I had a heavy bag since I was a teen and watched and practiced some Muay Thai), I am more like 15-20% fat than the 8-10% I used to be at 210 lbs, and I&rsquo;m quite out of shape and slow and drink alot of beer (and was drunk at the time).  </p>
<p>It hurt her leg when I blocked a kick to the head with my forearm. It really hurt her leg when she tried a low-kick or body kick and it hit my flexed, raised leg/knee. </p>
<p>And, she felt really silly when I&rsquo;d tap her in the head while she was trying her moves, or when I just grabbed her arms and pulled her down and sat on her and just kissed her on the forehead over and over. </p>
<p>She still can&rsquo;t believe it was so easy for me. </p>
<p>Bottom line, martial arts/self-defense classes just give a very dangerous bit of confidence to a woman. </p>
<p>And, having a black man teach it is just as dumb as it gets.</p>
<p>And, let&rsquo;s be honest, this girl who the original story is about was very likely taught lessons far worse than the idea that a girl can take on a man physically with a little Budo.</p>
<p>The lesson : Get them a real weapon and teach them about statistical realities of race.</p>

					<p>So many of you seem to have not read the article.  If the sex truly was coerced, as you seem to believe by your assertions about female&rsquo;s abilities to fight off males, why did she have sex with him 20 to 40 times over the course of 2 years?  The article does not say whether intial sexual assault was a willingly permitted one, but it seems like it probably was. This is not an overly horrific act and does not deserve anything like the death some of you prescribe.  If precautions were taken to prevent pregnancy and disease it was probably an overall harmless act.  </p>
<p>This is my opinion even though I believe that blacks <span class="caps">ARE </span>genetically predisposed to criminality, so do not assume that i am some jewish person who automatically sides against whites.</p>
<p>Whites have a right to segregate themselves from other races and it is unjust that the government prevents them from doing so through their use or sale of their own property</p>

You&rsquo;ve proven nothing   &mdash;   except that some people in Harlem have plenty of money to burn.    We all know that.  No surprise.  Sure, there are expensive apartments and townhouses in Harlem.   Do you mean to imply that <span class="caps">EVERYONE  </span>lives in a townhouse?   Where do you think the other millions live?  There are plenty of apartments that are available cheaply.  You don&rsquo;t have to travel 80 miles to find one.   And all those  places in the Bronx are just too unaffordable as well, I suppose?</p>
<p>I could quote you townhouses in Manhattan that cost millions. That doesn&rsquo;t mean every New Yorker lives in one.</p>

					<p>A training designed primarily for women, called &#8220;Model Mugging,&#8221; was  popular some years ago. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s still around, but it sounded effective. The male instructors wore an extreme amount of padding (they looked like huge teddy bears) that protected absolutely all parts of their body, and they trained the women to attack them with  very simple moves (such as slamming their foot down with full force on the aggressor&rsquo;s arch), carried out with total ferocity and lack of restraint immediately upon being grabbed or threatened by the trainer. </p>
<p>The women practiced the very simple moves (none requiring any special training  &mdash;  you just had to train your body to the point that it wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to, say, gouge out an eyeball) against the padded instructors over and over until their immediate ferocious responses had become automatic. The padding enabled the students to practice the simple moves without having to hold back  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s very important, to overcome the training that most of us have (certainly women) to launch something less than the most vicious attack we are capable of.</p>
<p>In the excellent novel, &#8220;The Collector,&#8221; the captive ends up dying because she involuntarily holds back slightly when she hits her captor over the head with a shovel in an attempt to escape. </p>
<p>As some have posted above, martial arts are often sold as a ridiculous sort of magic.</p>
<p>I once searched the net a bit for what the best move might be for an untrained person like myself if I were attacked by someone without a weapon. I settled on trying to gouge out an eye as quickly as possible. (Any comments by experienced, or militarily trained fighters?)</p>

<p>You seem not to have read all the comments.  It was  pointed out that sex with a minor of 15 constitutes Statutory Rape, and that&rsquo;s the crime right there. Period. Whether it was consensual or not is irrelevant in New York State.</p>

					<p>Three students accused of sex assault at Kingston High School <br>
By Dietrich Knauth, Freeman staff<br><br>
01/05/2008</p>
<p>There has been a similar (but worse) gang-rape of a 15 year-old girl by blacks [obvious from their names] in a highschool bathroom in Kingston, <span class="caps">NY, </span>a similar once-all-white community north of <span class="caps">NYC. </span> Three &#8220;students&#8221; thus far have been arrested.  &#8220;More arrests are expected.&#8221;  Police refused to say how many are being investigated. The newspaper refuses to divulge if the girl was white or to allow that question to be posted on its website.  (That means she was.)</p>
