						<p>In a quiet act of defiance, the Senate approved a $555 billion omnibus spending bill that removed legal requirements mandating the federal government fund 854 miles of a double layer border fence spanning America&rsquo;s southwestern border.</p>
<p>The funding requirement was codified into law when Congress passed, and President George W. Bush signed, the Secure Fence Act (SFA) in 2006.</p>
<p>When the spending bill, which combines appropriations for a number of federal agencies, reached the Senate, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) attached S.Amdt. 2466 to the measure in order to silently gut the SFA&rsquo;s spending requirement.</p>
<p>The Hutchison amendment reads, &#8220;Nothing in this paragraph shall require the secretary of homeland security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.&#8221; Thus, critics argue the amendment results in a de facto repeal of the SFA.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hutchison amendment gives DHS virtually total discretion over how and where the fence is built,&#8221; commented Steve Elliott, president of Grassfire.org. &#8220;In fact, DHS would not be required to build fencing in any particular location &mdash; and the double-layer mandate is totally gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But with the Senate&rsquo;s amendment, the fate of the fence remains in limbo and sets the stage for another congressional showdown on immigration now that the amended Senate version comes back to the House for consideration.</p>

			<p>I think it is just as well.  The fence is a waste of money in my opinion.  All you have to do is enforce the laws that are on the books against employers that hire illegal aliens.  As long as our government continues its nonenforcement of the immigration laws, people will come here.  A fence wont stop anyone.</p>

			<p>Didn&rsquo;t you just know that the Senate would ultimately stab us in the back on the fence? Face it folks, our government is determined to erase our international borders. In such case, it would make no more sense to have a fence between the U.S. and Mexico as it would to have one between North and South Dakota.</p>
<p>And by the way: regarding yesterday&rsquo;s posts in favor of Fred Thompson for President, it should be noted that he has Spencer Abraham as his campaign manager. The former senator from Michigan was one of the most strident supporters of open borders immigration in the Senate. Duncan Hunter, who was the architect of the idea to put a fence on the border to begin with, is far more reliable on the immigration issue.</p>

			<p>What can I tell you.  It&rsquo;s an election year.  Look up on numbersusa, who voted for it and vote against them.  Be sure to send them a nice letter telling them why they are no longer in office.  Also, send a nice letter to their replacement, explaining why they are in office&hellip;.and that you are watching them.</p>
<p>Quite frankly though, the point is moot.  La Raza and the rest are pretty open about the fact that they intend civil war in the United States.  Once they start shooting (and these guys are pretty clear that they intend violence), Congress will be forced to respond.</p>
<p>In other words, Congress thinks addressing the issue is optional.  That if they ignore it, it will go away.  That&rsquo;s a dangerous self-deception that is leading our country to war with Mexico.</p>

			<p>Just another sneaky yet blatant and outrageous act of treason by our so-called &#8220;representatives&#8221; in the White House!  Their total lack of regard for the rule of law and for the citizens of this country is absolutely astounding!  In fact, our &#8220;representatives&#8221; no longer look at us as &#8220;citizens&#8221;&hellip;  They&rsquo;re quite simply royalty and we&rsquo;re their subjects or rather, their cash cows.  As long as we keep paying our taxes, they&rsquo;ll keep slotting us into tinier and tinier stables!  What a life!  </p>
<p>Please google &#8220;Border Fence Emergency Petition&#8221; and sign it!</p>
<p>We must not ever give up our determination to save what&rsquo;s left of America!</p>

			<p>Both parties have already sold out. They are afriad of LaRaza,Hispanic lobbies, &amp; Mexico front for the drug lords.<br>
If they really wanted to protect &amp; defend the border it would have been done a long time ago. (Just look at the candidates for President/those who would protect borders and enforce the laws are electable)Whatever has happened in recent past is result of a plan laid a long time ago.   They sold US out to become the United Nations! <br>
Treason, betrayal, deceit, lies, &amp; fronting for foreign interests are possibly criminal acts upon the nation.  Even treaties made are not congruent with US Constitution.   V</p>

			<p>My good friends. If the border fence could be built for FREE or if I could just whip out my magic wand and &#8220;poof&#8221;, the fence suddenly appeared tonight, would it solve the problem? Uh&hellip;.NO.</p>
<p>I actually enjoy watching you squirm in your overstuffed computer desk chair. You still think this can be solved by peaceful means. No one will get hurt, everyone will leave&hellip;.like when they turn out the lights after a ball game. The fanatics and radicals will kick the dirt and curse over their apparent defeat, as they pick their way to their waiting cars, bitterly disappointed that their team had somehow lost.</p>
<p>As I have written to AmRen before, the time for compromise has passed. They (illegals and their friends) have no reason to make a deal with the citizens of this once-great country. They know they are here to stay and so do you. Every day their kids spend in school makes their argument for staying all the stronger. Every time they deposit their pay in a Wells Fargo or Bank of America, they know they have a good gringo friend in the banker. Every purchase they make, every politican they campaign for, every payment they make on a car or home, means they have a reason to stay here, even if that reason is purely emotional. The argument for expelling the illegal alien is just as valid on the first day as it is decades later. While the force to expel the invader remains an unchanged constant, their argument for staying only grows stronger every day they spend in this country.</p>
<p>Retreat is no longer an option. There is no place where American citizens can hide or escape from the inevitable. Either this country is worth fighting for or it is not. </p>
<p>The world population is expanding rapidly and the American population, especially white, is not even replacing itself, except in Utah. Every person in the world that can get here will show up to take what they want. If you cannot keep this country, you will lose this country. You will not keep it with words, no matter how angry you shout. You will not keep it with a fence, or a wall, or even surrounded with a moat or angry sea. You must say NO to the invasion and back up that NO with direct action against those who have already invaded and their friends. The time for compromise has already passed. There will be no deals to cut. The invader already knows your government will protect him from being forced (by you) to leave. Is this enough of a cause or are you simply waiting for the situation to become impossible to restore?<br>

			<p>The failed Amnesty was nothing. It did nothing in terms of removing the 20-30 million illegls here. It did nothing to stop new ones from coming. It did nothing to stop LEGAL immigration. It did nothing to stop the flow of refugees et&hellip;.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been aiming at the wrong target all along. The government is owned from the top down by Corporations who want cheap labor and a surplus of consumers. </p>
<p>Until we can figure out how to bring the corporations to their knees, we&rsquo;ll just be wasting time that we no longer have!&hellip;.</p>

			<p>Oh look&hellip;another Republican turncoat. Anyone surprised? Most of us here knew this grand fence scheme would never see the light of day anyway. This Illegal Invasion has gone on with the full, if deceitfully unspoken support of the Federal Government - they WANT the flood to continue. You cannot entrust those who are essentially the cause of a problem to fix the problem. That never works. Let us not pretend we are surprised - this is just business as usual in Washington. </p>

			<p>Apparently the open borders lobby didn&rsquo;t get the message sent by the defeat of the Bush amnesty in all but name.  To say that this is a democratic country, or even less, to say that the wishes of the vast majority of citizens are respected would be a mistake.  The elites do what they want, no matter what the people say.  This is exactly the opposite of the type of government that the founders created.  Somewhere along the line, and I have my own opinions on just when, we ceased to be a constitutional republic. </p>

<p>Hutchison continues to be the patsy for the NWO engineers who are proceeding apace with the implementation of the North American Union.  She has been a phony conservative and traitor to the Texas people her entire career.  She is taking such a gamble because she KNOWS that should the worst happen and she were to lose her Senate seat, she&rsquo;ll be retired out to pasture on the backs of the state taxpayers to a posh retirement befitting aristocracy.  </p>
<p>May my former fellow Texans sear her treachery in their memories, remember the broader meaning of &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Mess With Texas,&#8221; and do everything in your collective power to put her where she really belongs:  behind bars! </p>

			<p>Kay B Hutchison is represents the border area of Texas, and there are many people there that are angry about the fence because it would take some of their property. On one hand she has people telling her &#8220;protect my property rights or I wont vote for you&#8221;, and on the other hand she hears &#8220;stop immigration and build the fence or I wont vote for you&#8221;. She&rsquo;s damned no matter what side she takes.</p>

			<p>Listen everyone, a fence is meaningless.  Build it, and they&rsquo;ll dig under or swim around it.  In the end, it&rsquo;ll just be a waste of $$.  </p>
<p>There is one easy and guaranteed way to stop illegals from arriving, and get rid of those who are already here: ENFORCE THE LAWS AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON TO FUNCTION IN THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT LEGAL STATUS.  It&rsquo;s all about incentives.  </p>
<p>Bankrupt employers with massive fines who insist on using illegal labor.</p>
<p>Prevent any illegal from using any public service (education, health, welfare)   &mdash;   period.</p>
<p>Permit local authorities to investigate and enforce immigration laws.</p>
<p>Mass deport by force those who are found to be here illegally.</p>
<p>Fine banks who undertake wire transactions from a US to a Mexican account where the account holder is an illegal.</p>
<p>Enforce or impose these laws, and the flow of human traffic will reverse with an exodus of illegals OUT of the U.S. and back into Mexico, wall or no wall.</p>

			<p>Originally I thought that the Northeast was almost totally responsible for this betrayal over the years, and in a way they very much are. No movement can have leaders without followers though, so all of our senators are complicit in this unless they have taken a stand against the immivasion. </p>

			<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve been aiming at the wrong target all along. The government is owned from the top down by Corporations who want cheap labor and a surplus of consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not the only reason. These Corporations span the whole world. Their stakeholders are everywhere, they are not American Corporations anymore. They belong to the world and they serve the world.</p>

			<p>Dear Reader-1:</p>
<p>Thank you for your congratulations&hellip;I was one of those who foretold that the construction of this fence would never be built.  </p>
<p>How did I know?  Simple.  Because I understand clearly that the Cultural Marxists who control the federal government (both parties) have been working deligently for decades to rid the U.S. and the West of the White majority.  The Cultural Marxists (an alternate term I use due to politically correct sensitivities) require a multicultural society devoid of any one dominant ethnic majority (whites) in order for them to survive, thrive and retain power.  I calculated in 2006 that the fence-building bill was just a facade to appease the angry White voters while the Marxists continued to push for an increasingly cloaked version of amnesty.  Simply put, the Cultural Marxists will never allow a fence to be built when their decades of effort to ethnically cleanse this country of the White majority is finally coming to fruition. </p>

			<p>Listen everyone, a fence is meaningless. Build it, and they&rsquo;ll dig under or swim around it. In the end, it&rsquo;ll just be a waste of $$.</p>
<p><br>
No it&rsquo;s not.  The fence is only partly about stopping humans.  It&rsquo;s more about stopping goods.  Specifically drugs.</p>
<p>A person can hop a fence (with great difficulty).  But moving a tractor trailer full of drugs?  That&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>Drugs are what give these foreign invaders power.  Mexico funnels treasure out of the US through 4 means.  Oil.  Stolen welfare benefits.  Slave wages.  And DRUG MONEY.  Of these, drug money is the most dangerous and the most damaging.  The other three can be handled without a fence.  Cut off welfare to them is the easiest.  Simply stop giving it to them, lol.  Wage theft is harder to deal with.  But throwing their employers in jail is a very effective means.  Oil, is much harder still.  However, in a few short months, nuclear fusion power will be a reality.  And even if it wasn&rsquo;t, the US has a nice, 500 year supply of oil within our continental borders in the form of heavy distilletes. It is actually cheaper to harvest those (just ask Canada, which sells their heavy distilletes to us for a tidy profit) than to buy foreign oil.</p>
<p>Hardest of all is dealing with the drugs.  But it can be done, if we simply cut it off through the supply chain.  And the supply chain is only one place these days&hellip;.our southern border.  That cannot be done without a fence.  And it MUST be done.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Hutchison amendment reads, &ldquo;Nothing in this paragraph shall require the secretary of homeland security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.&rdquo; Thus, critics argue the amendment results in a de facto repeal of the SFA.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Department of Homeland Security&#8221; is a joke. Really!!! Any terrorist, criminal, person with a contagious disease, can come across.</p>

<i>Listen everyone, a fence is meaningless. Build it, and they&rsquo;ll dig under or swim around it. In the end, it&rsquo;ll just be a waste of $$.</i></p>
<p>Quite on the contrary.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that we have so many morons in America who, although completely unfit to reason, keep offering their moronic advice.</p>
<p>A fence is one of the most effective protections against Mexican invasion, just as strong door and locks are effective against burglary, and fences around gated residential communities are effective against trespassing. </p>
<p>If a fence were just a waste of money, the cheerleaders of Mexican invasion would not oppose it as vehemently as they do. Also, there would be no fence around the White House.</p>
<p>Of course, if you left a fence unguarded (or your locked house uninhabited), there would be intruders who, eventually, bypass it one way or another. But this is why we have Border Patrol to prevent it from happening.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, without a fence we won&rsquo;t be able to protect the border at all. Imagine tens of thousands of Mexican women with children crossing the American border at the same time. No &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; and no &#8220;technology&#8221; will stop them. And the BP agents will just watch them helplessly violating our border and country. It&rsquo;s like having a sophisticated alarm system in a house with open doors and no locks. As soon as there are enough determined criminals willing to get inside it, it will be impossible to stop them.</p>
<p>There is one more flaw in the above moronic advice. </p>
<p>Hardly anything is 100% effective. Flu vaccine is about 80% effective. Cancer treatment (chemotherapy) roughly 50% effective. Bullet-proof vest is no protection against military caliber teflon projectile. But it would be idiotic to insist that these partially effective measures are but a waste of money, so they should not be employed. So is the fence. If it is &#8220;only&#8221; 90% effective, it&rsquo;s well worth building it. </p>
<p>So, beware of all half-baked political &#8220;analysts&#8221; who use <b>idiot&rsquo;s logic</b> of kind <b>&#8220;Show me a 10 ft fence and I will show you an 11 ft ladder&#8221;</b>. These are the morons who are largely responsible for surrendering up front where there is a good chance to win.</p>

			<p>In response to A Reader in response to my original post:</p>
<p>You miss my point entirely, which was: rather than spend millions of dollars building a fence that illegals will surely circumvent anyway, I believe a much more effective approach would be to eliminate the incentives for illegal immigration in the first instance.  </p>
<p>You analogize the situation to building a fence around a private residential community or the White House.  I think a much better analogy is one where each home owner is permitted to use a gun and shoot any intruder / trespasser on his property (and that any such intruder spend the rest of his life in prison, if caught alive).  Of course, you can still build a fence around your house to prevent the crime, but the more important thing is making sure we DETER THROUGH PUNISHMENT of those who trespass / burglarize our residential homes.  After all, if someone can burglarize you with impunity (or even be rewarded for it), they&rsquo;ll probably find a way to get around your physical fence.  </p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the real problem with immigration: we need to DETER BY PUNISHING the illegals for their illegal behavior.  Therefore, in my mind, it is much more important that we impose and enforce a system of harsh penalties, which will deter the immigrants from coming here in the first place.  Of course, you might still want to build a fence even after we&rsquo;ve established a proper system of law enforcement / sanctions.  My point is that the system of deterrence is the most pressing need, because it will be many, many times more effective at ending and reversing illegal immigration than any physical impediment.</p>
<p>There is nothing &#8220;moronic&#8221; in this view.  It is based on basic principles regarding human psychology and economic behavior.  Moreover, my approach not only has the benefit of PREVENTING further illegal immigration, but also REVERSING the flow of illegals who are already here.  In contrast, a fence will do nothing to reverse the situation about the illegals already in the US.</p>

			<p>Some years ago, the hype from Congress was that a guest worker program would primarily serve to create a permanent underclass of people for America. Now the traitorcrats in Congress are busily doing exactly that   &mdash;   creating a permanent underclass by allowing us to be overrrun with third-world immigrants, legal and/or illegal.</p>

			<p>Show me a ten foot fence, and I&rsquo;ll show you an 11 foot ladder.  You do that, then I&rsquo;ll show you a sharpshooter with a good rifle, picking off the ladder climber.  A few of those, and the deluge will stop.  Fences work.  One good one lasted the Chinese for hundreds of years.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Quite frankly though, the point is moot. La Raza and the rest are pretty open about the fact that they intend civil war in the United States. Once they start shooting (and these guys are pretty clear that they intend violence), Congress will be forced to respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>la raza would be foolish to use violence because the US government is doing all it can to make la raza&rsquo;s dream come true.</p>

			<p>Dr.Gutberlet: The Confederacy was foolish to fire on Fort Sumter.  All they had to do was ignore the Federal authorities for a few years, and in 1865, President Breckinridge or whoever would have recognized the new government.  But the southerners thought they could whip ten Yankees each, and did not put a leash on fools like General Beauregard, who started the fighting.  Do you think that the raza boys will be more prudent than the South?  They want to whip the gringos, they dream of it.  Cholos go to bed at night and tell themselves stories about taking it all from the White man.  No, I don&rsquo;t think they will wait for it to be handed to them.  </p>

			<p>The Confederacy did not fire on Ft Sumter. The sovereign nation of South Carolina fired on Ft Sumter and only did so to get Marxist troublemaker Lincoln out of their nation who had sent them there to goad them into firing so he could easily whip them and teach them a quick lesson. <br>
People forget easily that the great SC Senator John C Calhoun was the father of secession decades earlier and wrote about it many times watching how the Tory weak brain crooks in the north were mistreating his very wealthy state with its great world class seaport in Charleston who was good friends with most of Europe. <br>
The other 10 states only joined in to help SC and the new America was born that was actually the old America since the south is where the nation was founded and created original called Virginia. </p>

			<p>To those posters who are arguing that the fence is meaningless anyway, even if you were right as rain, that is not the issue. The issue is it was voted on by &#8220;our representatives&#8221; and signed by El Presidente. In as much as we call ourselves a representative democracy, this refusal to do the peoples will, and mandated by a democratic process, is treason, pure and simple. How will the citizenrys will be violated next??</p>
