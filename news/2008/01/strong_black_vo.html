						<p>Landslide margins among black voters powered Barack Obama to his win Saturday in South Carolina&rsquo;s Democratic presidential primary, allowing him to overcome the telling edge Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Edwards had among whites.</p>
<p>Blacks made up 55 percent of the voters in Saturday&rsquo;s contest, slightly more than turned out in the state&rsquo;s primary four years ago and by far their biggest share in any presidential contest so far this year. Obama won 78 percent of their votes, with black men and women supporting the Illinois senator by about that same margin, according to exit polls of Democratic voters conducted Saturday for The Associated Press and the networks.</p>
<p>Clinton and Edwards split the white vote about equally, with each getting support from nearly four in 10 and Obama getting about a quarter. Obama&rsquo;s high-water mark among white voters so far this year has been the 36 percent he got in New Hampshire, where he finished second overall to Clinton; he also got a third of the white vote in the year&rsquo;s first contest in Iowa, enough for him to win overall in that state.</p>
<p>Highlighting the decisive role race played in Saturday&rsquo;s voting, eight in 10 of Obama&rsquo;s votes came from blacks. About six in 10 of Clinton&rsquo;s and nearly all of Edwards&rsquo; came from whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racial attitudes were also in play in voters&rsquo; perceptions of how effective the candidates would be if elected. Whites were far likelier to name Clinton than Obama as being most qualified to be commander in chief, likeliest to unite the country and most apt to capture the White House in November. Blacks named Obama over Clinton by even stronger margins &mdash; two- and three-to-one &mdash; in all three areas.</p>
<p>Following a week of criticism between the Obama and Clinton campaigns in which race became a factor, Obama&rsquo;s relatively small share of white supporters in South Carolina could raise questions about his ability to attract those voters in the crucial Super Tuesday contests on Feb. 5, when nearly half the country will vote.</p>
<p>Because of his heavy support from blacks, Obama negated the advantage Clinton has enjoyed among women in most of this year&rsquo;s contests. He got more than half the female vote, compared with three in 10 supporting Clinton, the New York senator.</p>
<p>But the gender breakdown was heavily affected by race. Though Obama won eight in 10 votes of black females, Clinton and Edwards led among white women, getting about four in 10 of their votes, about double Obama&rsquo;s share.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a race featuring candidates who would be the country&rsquo;s first female or first black president, about three-quarters of Democrats said they thought the country was ready for either historic event to occur. And in a show of general Democratic satisfaction with their choices, more than eight in 10 overall said they would be satisfied if Obama were the nominee, while about three-quarters said the same about Clinton.</p>

			<p>Of course, only an idiot would see that &#8220;every&#8221; non-white racial group in the U.S. is &#8220;racially concious&#8221;:<br>
Asians are racially concious.<br>

			<p>While I seriously doubt Obama has a chance, particularly since he will need a LOT of white voters to actually win, I do wonder what might happen if he did?  Would the black folks in America suddenly lose that chip they have for anything white?  Unlikely.  However, on the other side, maybe white people will be less inclined to listen to the endless whining about how evil whitey is holding the black man down.  Where will the proof be then?  It will be gone.  Why?  Because the ONLY way for Obama to get into office is if Evil, Racist, Bigoted white people vote for him.  But the black community is so accustomed to hating whitey that most are too stupid to realize how all that kind of talk has eroded their chances for success in America.  Most white people aren&rsquo;t racists.  If they were, we would likely NEVER have had a civil rights act passed, slavery wouldn&rsquo;t have ended and Obama would be working on a farm.  Think hard before you hate whitey.  It can&rsquo;t go on if you REALLY want to see success in America.</p>

			<p>After witnessing the events unfolding in Kenya over the last few weeks, I think we&rsquo;ve gotten a pretty clear picture of how blacks react when a candidate of their ethnicity loses a national election.  At this point, I don&rsquo;t believe black America has enough emotionally invested in Obama&rsquo;s campaign to riot if he fails to get the nomination (plus they&rsquo;ve still got left-wing Hillary to fall back on and cushion the blow).  However, if Obama gets the nomination and loses to a Republican in the general election I think we may witness the most widespread ethnic rioting in American history.  This may be the wake up call white America needs.</p>

			<p>This is the only MSM piece I have read so far that does not sugar coat, or deny the tribal behavior which took place in the South Carolina Democratic primary. And the last paragraph gives a glimpse at the PC poison afflicting Democratic Party members on the topics of race and gender. I wish them more of the same, unitl they disapear from the national scene.</p>

			<p>If the democrats or John McCain win the white house this year you are looking at the end of the republican party and an end to a two party system. I can see Illegal Aliens being given AMNESTY by either winner and given the right to vote happening almost over night and with the hispanics and blacks allegiances being toward the democratic party you will never see another republican or conservative elected to even the lowest of positions in either state or national races&hellip;&hellip;the nation is dead!</p>

If whites performed in similar fashion, the PC police and the anti-white talking heads(sharpton,jackson,et al) would be throwing themselves down in the streets screaming racism to their dying breath. When, OH when, will white people realize and come to the aid of THEIR brethren and  stop this insane blame whitey for everything game. God Help Us All Indeed.</p>

			<p>There are few times in modern America one can observe naked displays of racial solidarity more so than when it comes to Blacks and election time. The candidates openly court their own kind and the voters make no pretense of colorblindness, the way dopey, misguided Whites do. Identity-politcs are the order of the day in this country, and it is never more shameless and open than when Blacks are involved. Naturally, all &#8220;right-thinking&#8221; Whites, the media, other candidates, etc., all dutifully pretend they don&rsquo;t see any of it!  </p>

			<p>Amren&rsquo;s subheadline reads:</p>
<p>Blacks continue to vote mostly along racial lines</p>
<p>But the numbers presented in the article show that BOTH races voted along racial lines.  78% of blacks vote for Obama; 75% of whites voted for the two white candudates.</p>

			<p>He got roughly three quarters of the black vote, and the two white candidates split three quarters of the white vote.  This is hardly a &#8220;voting along racial lines&#8221; mandate.</p>

			<p>I looked over the exit polling, and the reasons why Obama won in SC are the reasons why HRC will ultimately win the nomination.  The combination of blacks and young whites can only win him states in the Deep South; outside of those I think he&rsquo;ll probably only win Illinois.</p>

<p>Well, there is the silver lining in this story; that whites (even ones as pathetically stupid, as to have the Democrats as their party of choice) are still capable of consciously factoring race into a decision of political importance, even when the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media is openly encouraging them not to. Heck, today I was able to witness the Kennedy troika endorse &ldquo;savior&rdquo; Obama (due to an unexpected day off of work,) to the much gushing and glowing delight of the media swine on FOX and MSNBC. The race of choice for the &ldquo;talking heads&rdquo; and &ldquo;pundits&rdquo; seems to be McCain versus Obama in 2008, with the distinct hope that Obama will trounce McCain in the general election. So deeply do they desire, our race blind acceptance of the multicultural ideal, that is their fantasized Utopian States of America. </p>
<p>Amazingly, I have found myself inexplicably gravitating toward rooting for a Hillary victory in the primaries. Ever since his victory in Iowa, that was so lauded by the media &ldquo;elites&rdquo; and other establishment fools as his &ldquo;unstoppable&rdquo; momentum toward the nomination, I have somewhat delighted in Hillary&rsquo;s &ldquo;upsets.&rdquo; It is not that I really want her as our president (God and all Heaven forbid that,) it is simply my natural inclination to desire the public crushing of their collective multicultural hopes and dreams; a Hillary victory in the primaries (driven by white and even Hispanic votes, against the blacks&rsquo; trend toward Obama) would achieve this. Watching their angst at &ldquo;the first black president&rsquo;s&rdquo; coded racial entreaties on behalf of his wife, and the ever growing racially motivated rifts in voting patterns that surround the contenders, simply warms my heart. </p>
<p>This would be because we the people ultimately decide elections, not them, despite all of their machinations and sophistry!</p>
<p>Hopefully, their little darlings Obama and McCain will crash and burn next Tuesday, leaving them to sneeringly watch in their sanctimony, as Mitt Romney defeats Hillary Clinton by about his 57% to her 43% of the popular vote in the November 2008 general election?  Let them emotionally writhe and seethe, at our still unrepentant and unmitigated rejection of their version of &ldquo;nonracially&rdquo; oriented Communism. Let them lay awake at night, whimpering  like the spoiled child denied the paper butterfly or kaleidoscope by their parents at Toys R Us, that they so had to have, and so did not need to add to their bursting toy box of undeserved trinkets and baubles.</p>
<p>What more to say, other than, God let it be so!<br>

			<p>The strange thing about this win in South Carolina is that the top issue was predicted to be the economy.  But come to find out the top issue was race afterall.  In fact Obama hasn&rsquo;t said much at all about the economy.  So race was the crucial factor.  Its race before anything else for the blacks.  Maybe its time whites started to view things the same way.</p>

			<p>This is GREAT news! Now if only all white politicians would realize that they are cutting their own careers short by pandering to minorities. These results should send a strong message that regardless of how much they proclaim to feel minorities pain, all their a**kissing is for naught when they eventually compete for office against a slick-talking, polished minority candidate. And if Hillary Clinton is the first one to be sacrificed at the alter of multiculturalism, the alter that she and her ilk have shoved down our throats, then that makes it all the better. <br>
Equally amusing is watching her squirm when trying to debate racial issues with Obama. Hillary-ous!!! Good riddance, Commie!</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think Obama has a chance to win the November election.  With all the fawning coverage, the best he can do is 36% of White Democrats?  Liberals lie, but most of them know as well as we do what Black power means, and they want none of it for themselves.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering out loud:</p>
<p>If Obama does not become the Demo-rats presidential nominee, will blacks riot?</p>
<p>If Obama is the Dem candidate, but the Presidency goes to a Repug-la-can instead, will the blacks riot?</p>
<p>If Obama becomes the first African  &mdash;  his father was an African, not an American  &mdash;  President of the US; and if said President Hussein fails to get the Congress to provide slave-pay and many other goodies for the native&rsquo;s, will the blacks riot?</p>
<p>Seriously, how can we go wrong with a prez born in Honolulu to a black father named Barack from Kenya; and to a crazed white woman named Stanley from Kansas? If any of us have doubts concerning Obama&rsquo;s qualifications to be prez, know this: He used alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to &#8220;push questions of who I was out of my mind&#8221;. An out-of-his-mind prez is just what we need right now. You just have to love the Dem-wits for trying to push this guy onto the American people.</p>
<p>After eight years of Clinton, followed by eight years of Bush, to pile on four or eight more years of similar loony leadership would be absolutely criminal, which is all our government in Washington is anyway: a loony, organized crime syndicate that would make Capone envious as hell, its loony-bin nature notwithstanding.  </p>
<p>Last question: Can you truly waste your vote if voting is truly a waste?</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the big surprise? It&rsquo;s Human nature!  Everyone votes along racial lines and no protest to the contrary is credible.<br>
Whites will cast their votes for the White half of Obama because they feel that his White genes make him less of a threat. He&rsquo;s playing on that but make no mistake, he considers himself Black. <br>
The sad thing is that there is absolutely no decent alternative on the White side in either party. </p>

			<p>I suppose the fact that he is 1/2 caucasion didn&rsquo;t register along racial lines either. This is just like when you see that new $32000.00 Chrysler 300 or Charger for $99 down and $99 per month. Some people just don&rsquo;t have the ability to think about what&rsquo;s wrong with the picture.</p>

			<p>I hope everyone witnessed the clip of Obama standing before a group of Latinos and chanting &#8220;Si, se puede.&#8221; This brought back upleasant memories of the illegal alien marchers who were demanding equal rights. Doesn&rsquo;t the senator know that illegals are taking many jobs formerly held by blacks? Jesse and Al seem clueless on this, so I guess it&rsquo;s lost on Sen. Obama too.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Highlighting the decisive role race played in Saturday&rsquo;s voting, eight in 10 of Obama&rsquo;s votes came from blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, Blacks vote black 80% of the time.</p>
<p>Can we now dispense with the whole &#8220;I have a dream&#8221; rhetoric, and acknowledge that WHITES need to vote for their own, and that this is no more &#8216;racist,&rsquo; than what BLACKS did in SC?</p>
<p>If not, why not?</p>
<p>Because the whole house of cards that is multiculturalism would come &#8216;a tumblin&rsquo; down,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure of that Blogmeister.  How do you explain Iowa?  He was also pretty close in New Hampshire and Nevada.  I would agree that Hillary won&rsquo;t win any Deep South states and I so enjoy watching her being slapped in the face by the very people she grovelled to.  She&rsquo;s in for the fight of her life.     <br>

			<p>Let me say I have no love for Hillary and that I prefer Obama. There was a recent poll in South Carolina, and 2 out of 3 black voters marked Obama&rsquo;s experience as being greater than that of Hillary Clinton. This result is just proof blacks lie, and that polls can&rsquo;t be trusted as anything other than a measure of stated opinion, or in this case, lies. Actually, for the most part I already knew blacks are all about lying. </p>

			<p>Frankenstein obama is the least of all the candidates.  I saw a picture of him on the news(headshot)today that I swear bore a strong resemblance to Frank N. Stein. He is not a good looking man, if in fact he is a man.</p>

			<p>Blacks prove over and over again who the &#8221; true racists &#8221; are, inspite of liberal Marxist media or corrupt politicians, esp. demo-rats, who blame &#8220;whitey &rsquo; for being evil; un contraire, you commies.</p>

			<p>Back in the day, when Ronald Reagan was president, Black folks would tell me: &#8220;He&rsquo;s your president&hellip;mmmmm hmmm, he yo prezzident alright&#8221;.  In other words they wanted nothing to do with him or the policies (politics) he espoused even though he was the last presidential candidate - White or Black - to actually place himself among them in the open street while trying in earnest to win their votes during the campaign that resulted in his first term in the White House.  Much of what he worked for  while in office benefited Blacks tremendously.  Yet the overwhelming majority simply could not allow themselves to get past his &#8220;whiteness&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Oh well.  4 years or so after Reagan left office they got their &#8220;first Black president&#8221;.  So how are they doing - those darkly-hued doubting Thomas&rsquo; of my youth - since, say, 1986?  What are their and their progeny&rsquo;s prospects for tomorrow?   </p>

			<p>blacks are very conflicted of a race it seems.  They want whites to judge them by their character, yet they want to preserve their race.  What hypocrites</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know about NH, but IA and NV were caucuses, not primaries.  This gives dedicated radicals more political fulcrum.</p>
<p>Look at the D-FL beauty contest yesterday.  HRC 50%, BHO 33%.  If BHO gets trounced in FL, then he can&rsquo;t win the whole thing.  Here in MO, which votes next Tuesday, HRC has a 15-20 point lead depending on the poll.  MO, of course, being one of those bellwhethers  they&rsquo;re always talking about.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that Blogmeister. How do you explain Iowa? He was also pretty close in New Hampshire and Nevada.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have a theory although I can&rsquo;t prove it.  I think Republicans are voting in the Democratic Primaries for Obama in order to foil Hillary&rsquo;s grab for the nomination.  I think they&rsquo;re doing this in the open primary states.  I also think they re-registered as Democrats weeks ago in the closed state primaries.  If it&rsquo;s true, the strategy is brilliant.  If Obama is nominated, the Republicans win the election.  As we already saw in SC, even alot of White Democrats won&rsquo;t vote for Obama.  The only flaw to this plan is that the Democrats are probably doing the same thing in the Republican Primaries.  It would explain why one of the sorriest of the candidates, McCain (next to Guiliani) has been coming out on top. Clinton would win hands down against such a match. </p>
