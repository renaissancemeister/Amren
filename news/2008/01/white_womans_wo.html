<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>I know a Romanian student who is studying classical dancing on scholarship in Delhi. One evening, an autorickshaw driver extended his hand and tried to grope her thighs. She hit him so hard with her bag that he is not likely to forget that in a hurry. Many foreign women I&rsquo;ve met have similar India stories to tell.</p>
<p>Why do Indian men behave so badly with foreign women? Recently they arrested a security guard in a backwaters resort in Kerala for trying to molest two Canadian girls aged 12 and 14. The family cut short their holiday and left. The police in Goa are looking for a man who allegedly raped a British woman after giving her a lift. An American tourist was sexually assaulted in a temple in Pushkar. A guesthouse owner in Udaipur is accused of raping a journalist from England. The list is endless. All this and more happened in the last month or so.</p>
<p>If this state of affairs continues, word will spread that India is no longer a safe place for women to travel. In Saudi Arabia, women are not allowed to drive, they cannot teach male students or treat male patients. We are much more civilised. We just don&rsquo;t allow them to walk safely on our streets, especially if they happen to be white.</p>
<p>By the time you read this, the alarm bells would have rung in the Union tourism ministry, and the minister would have called a meeting to see how female visitors can be protected from our desi louts. The situation might improve for a while in the coming months, but you can bet your tourist dollar that it will be business as usual after that.</p>
<p>Sudhir Kakar, who lives in Goa, says that a white woman walking alone there is likely to be stopped by someone on a motorcycle and asked point-blank, &ldquo;Do you want to be f*****d?&rdquo; Or words to that effect. Kakar is an authority on human behaviour and I asked him why this should be so. &ldquo;The Indian woman is a maa, a beti or a bahu for these men. The white woman, on the other hand, is fair game. She is a whore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sexual harassment of women is a worldwide problem. They get their bottoms pinched in Rome. In New York, men on construction sites will make lewd remarks to pretty women passing by. The behaviour of Indian men is less innocuous; there is nothing playful about it. He wants to bed that woman, nothing less. And he is prepared to use force if necessary. He has the impression that westerners treat sex as casually as shaking hands.</p>
<p>This is racism, but there is more to it. Indian men prefer fair women to dusky ones. And there is nothing fairer than white. If you need convincing on that point, I suggest you turn to the matrimonial pages of our Sunday newspapers. All the potential brides have fair complexions. The dozens of creams in the market that claim to whiten the skin all do brisk business.</p>
<p>An Indian man may not be willing to marry a white woman but, if he had a choice, he would prefer to have sex with a white woman rather than an Indian one. There are other factors involved in the harassment of white women &mdash; lack of sexual outlet, men still being virgins well past puberty, sometimes frigid wives &mdash; but the colour of the victim&rsquo;s skin plays an important part. You will not find African women being harassed in this country.</p>
<p>Tourists are more vulnerable. They usually haven&rsquo;t been long enough in the country to read the signals right, to figure out that their polite response to what seems to be a helpful, friendly gesture is often construed as a readiness for sex. White women who have made India their home have less of a problem. They have taken to wearing salwar kameez, they have some knowledge of Hindi, which establishes their local credentials, they don&rsquo;t accept invitations for a drink or a movie or a ride from men they do not know. They have learnt how to freeze someone who is too persistent in his attentions or getting uncomfortably familiar, and to walk in a manner that puts out a clear signal: don&rsquo;t mess with me.</p>
<p>The Lonely Planet guide advises female tourists to refrain from wearing sleeveless blouses, tight-fitting clothing or from trying the bra-less look. &ldquo;Getting constantly stared at is something you&rsquo;ll simply have to get used to. Just walk confidently and refrain from returning male stares, as this may be considered a come-on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sound advice. The Indian woman would have learnt these tricks with her mother&rsquo;s milk!</p>

			<p>I can tell you that I witness sexual harassment of White females every single day! My advice to White women is this: get a White boyfriend/husband and take him every where with you. If you are walking down the streets of Las Vegas(or any other big city) your life is literally in the hands of non-whites. You are nothing, but a piece of meat to non-whites. You have Larry Flynt and Hugh Hefner to thank for this. Also thank Britney Spears, Anna Nicole Smith and &#8220;sluts&#8221; like them.</p>

			<p>Wasn&rsquo;t this the view of that charming Arab fellow in Sweden in relation to Arab-immigrant rapes of white Swedish women?</p>
<p>But, to be fair, our &#8220;Big Media&#8221; loves to throw out the &#8220;white whore&#8221; archetype - should we be surprised if others pick up on it?</p>

			<p>One issue Mr. Patel conveniently missed is the mass infanticide of female infants and the gender imbalance it has caused.  With less females around, those who are left will feel more pressure - and those perceived as vulnerable (or more attractive) will be pressured even more.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why do they treat foreign women so badly?&#8221; <br>
Answer~ Cause they ain`t no foreign men around. Sorry, they just don`t have the physical size or cultural arrogance to pull it off with out getting slapped into next week. Like a punjabi kitchen worker I knew who wanted to bartend for four times the money. Got turned down again and again. He put it down to racism and asked what I thought. I told him he couldn`t do the job. He said that he knew how to mix drinks. I told him, &#8220;Yeah but when it comes time to say Fu@& you cowboy! Pay me! they`re just gonna laugh at you. He gave a gulp of understanding and quietly dropped it&hellip;</p>

			<p>It really is quite simple really.  In all cultures, in all time periods, women were protected by men.  Molest a woman and you would be killed by her husband, sons and community.  There was a time when an indian man, accosting a white woman would be unthinkably dangerous, as whites, being technologically and culturally advanced far beyond indians were far more adept at violence, than they were.  Definitely carrying a sword (and knowing how to use it), probably carrying a pistol, and possibly surrounded by bodyguards.  Well, it&rsquo;s obvious what would happen&hellip;..so it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Things have changed.  Women have become emancipated (and men have become feminized).  This was done out of a sense of fairness and an attempt to make women equal.  But all it has really done is stripped white women of the protection of her men.  This is the reason (and the ONLY reason) vicious non-whites feel free to attack them.  Whites have evolved to the point where a woman can mostly feel safe in the company of other whites she does not know.  Non-whites have not evolved this way and probably never will.</p>
<p>In the short term, the solution is easy.  Stay away from non-whites.  Don&rsquo;t go to india or any other non-white country.  Segregate minorities from white neighborhoods and police them heavily.</p>
<p>But, in the long term, whites MUST strike a balance between enlightenment and warriorship.  This issue is not unique to us.  It has happened before with other cultures at different time periods.  Those cultures that failed and chose enlightenment and non-violence were exterminated by their violent neighbors.  Humans are not allowed to make this choice, at least not yet.  We haven&rsquo;t evolved to that point.  The price of disobeying this biological imperative&hellip;.is death.</p>

			<p>Reversing the colors, the situation is similar here in my South East Asian 3rd world country. It is so common for foreign men to treat the local women like whores, we don&rsquo;t even notice it. When I am talking to a foreigner (mainly white men), I completely ignore his girl friend, he will probably have a different one next week.</p>
<p>So, I am not offended with India&rsquo;s situation. It is perfectly natural for people of differrent colors to look down on each other.</p>

			<p>This reminds me of an instance a long time ago when my family was traveling in Turkey.  As we were making our way through a narrow street my mother told me to put my six-year old sister on my shoulders. I thought my sister was tired and needed to be carried but quickly knew differently when my mother told me that a bunch of men were pinching my six-year old sister&rsquo;s bottom. She thought me carrying my sister would prevent the &ldquo;men&rdquo; from groping her. It became apparent this was not working as the &ldquo;men&rdquo; relentlessly continued pinching my six-year old sister&rsquo;s bottom and now breast area. My family then formed a tight physical barricade around my sister to keep the &ldquo;men&rdquo; off her. </p>

			<p>White women have become extremely promiscuous as of the latter half of the 20th Century.  White men may like the ease of scoring but in the end it has cost them their dominant place, not only in the home, but in the world itself.  The very first thing to go in Western society was morals and ethics.  All the other dominoes fell right behind them.</p>
<p>By the way, just how low will you let your daughter&rsquo;s jeans sit on her pelvic area?  I am shocked at some of the outfits the young ladies in our country are allowed to leave their homes in.  All too often mommy and daddy are intentionally raising a whore.  Poor behavior that used to be ostracised is now not only acceptable but heavily promoted.<br>

			<p>As an Indian reading this article it has really annoyed and surprised me that this is happening, I&rsquo;ve heard of harrasment in Arab countries of white women but not India.<br>
Whereas I totally condemn this sort of behaviour the western pop culture should shoulder some of the blame for how white women are portrayed, girls in western societies are sexualised at a young age and the traditional roles of women totally debased.   </p>

			<p>White women are called &#8220;whores&#8221; because non-white men lust for them so strongly and the ones who (thank god) deny their advances get called whores.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Who lives in Goa&hellip;&#8221;<br>
 There is a movie scene about how things used to be, I`m thinking, in colonial times in Goa and Idida perhaps.  It shows a sentimental version of White condfidence and eager native aquiescense in a way that doesn`t demean either and builds up both. <br>
  Trevor Howard plays the business man trying to &#8220;buy&#8221; a brothel for the night as a wartime distraction for enemy troops so that they will  liquored  up and away from post. <br>
 Trevor: Are you the propieitor here?<br>
 Native: Yes!  All them clean girls.. You wish something sir?<br>
 Trevor: Once I was a sailor&hellip; now I am an old and wealthy man.<br>
 Native: Yes! But always a sailor in your heart! Continue sir..<br>
 Trevor:I want to buy every man in the port a special gift&hellip;<br>
 Native : Magnificent Sir! What a grand gesture you make.<br>
 Finally Trevor Howard asks,&#8221; Good! Now can we agree to price?&#8221;<br>
 The scene ends as they walk arm in shoulder inside to arrange details. I am always strcuk by two things. The White man is not perturbed by native squalor and the native is helpful but not pushy in getting his business. Mutual respect all around with both White and Native and client and shopkeeper knowing their roles and boundries. Its &#8220;The Sea Wolves&#8221; about the raid on nuetral Goa. </p>

			<p>I work in the hi tech/computer industry, and there are MANY Indians in this field.  They are absolutely, the most depraved and sexually deviant people I&rsquo;ve ever encountered.  I have no problem believing the things in this article.  They lust after white women even more than blacks and have made comments here even about white children.  I have no doubt they would rape a pre-pubescent white girl if they had half a chance.  Why anyone would want to visit the 3rd world hellhole of India is beyond me.</p>

			<p>Of course Indian men would prefer to have sex with white women.  They are prettier, more feminine, smell a lot better, and have a more pleasing demeanor than do Indian, African, and semitic women.   It is a simple fact and I challenge anyone to contradict me with fact.  Any dark skinned person who makes a lot of money will first of all find a white woman to marry and give him fairer skinned kids.  End of story.</p>

<p>If you ever watch the show &#8220;To Catch a Predator&#8221; about adults trying to meet children on-line and then meet them to have sex, you will notice that this is true.  Whenever they go somewhere like California with even a somewhat small Indian population, they catch a large number of Indian men trying to meet and have sex with what they believe is a 13 or 14 year old white girl.</p>

<p>The white women I know who have been to India were there on business, not for pleasure. I haven&rsquo;t heard them say anything about being sexually harrassed on the streets. I got the impression that the companies they worked for made sure they were safe and wouldn&rsquo;t have to walk around alone. These women are in their forties, which might also make a difference. The Indian men probably prefer younger women.</p>

			<p>Fairer skin is simply more pretty, rare and exotic among the human population.  </p>
<p>When I see articles like this, I wonder if white supremacists are actually right:</p>
<p>-Lighter people and pale skin are considered more beautiful in almost every part of the world<br>
-Most important inventions came from or were developed to use by European peoples, who brought the world into modernity.  Chemistry, physics, calculus, almost everything by White people.</p>
<p>When I think of things like these and the recessive and more rare genes of white people, I ask if &#8216;white seperatism&rsquo; has grounds.</p>

<p>This is true. I have worked in Hong Kong as an Engineer. White men go completely crazy over there - the name is yellow fever. Even for white men who would never have considered  an Asian women back home. And they treat the Chinese girls like objects. This happened even in the 1950s and 1960s. Chinese girls were referred to as LBFMs - &#8220;little-brown-you know what-machines.&#8221;<br>
I have seen white men feel Chinese girls up in nightclubs, grope them and even kiss them on the lips - without the consent of the girl in question. </p>
<p>It is a well known phenomenon of expatriate life in East Asia - white men go for Asian women and eschew white women expats. The white women expats want nothing to do with the local Asian men - so most of them go dateless.</p>
<p>Whites shouldn&rsquo;t get too uptight about how non-whites look at their women. White men treat East Asian women no differently.</p>
<p>If white women were not so brainwashed by feminist propaganda and started acting like women and treated their men as men, maybe white men would act with more confidence and keep their own women away from blacks- and then start themselves staying away from Asian women. Feminism has truly made a mess of things for everyone.</p>

			<p>Some of the other posts were correct in this aspect, meaning the we, white society, are partly to blame for this stereotype.<br>
I&rsquo;m referring to the way women dress and behave today.</p>
<p>I remember a few years back, I got into a disagreement with some Mexicans.  They (males and females) believed that all white women were promiscuous.  They pointed out the moral laxity in TV shows and movies.  Then they said &#8220;We see them on vacation in Mexico, the way they behave, drinking, having sex in public&#8221; and provided many anecdotes of their experiences.</p>
<p>I really wanted to point out the hypocrisy in their own culture in regards to these matters, but somehow they&rsquo;d just taken the wind out of my sails.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m always aware of how I conduct myself and my manner of dress.  I aim to represent white womanhood with dignity.<br>
But oftentimes we don&rsquo;t help our own cause with our own behavior.</p>

<p>How could you possibly be so ignorant about your culture? These stories are well known, sheesh on one of the reality travel shows the american women were forced to ride a bus Delhi and were molested horribly by hoards of Indian men.</p>
<p>As far as Arab countries go, I have heard Egypt can be a bit sketchy but in many strict Arab/Muslim countries touching an unknown woman in public would quickly land you in a jail cell.</p>
<p>I have to agree with some of the other posters, the Indian men I have met through work are complete degenerates and I can&rsquo;t stand them.</p>

			<p>Avoid going to India and the middle-East completely. Other south Asian nations are even worse. Except Bhutan which is like paradise but to get there you have to pass through India itself. <br>
The only place left safe for going is te western world and maybe the far east. <br>
But if you are India or the middle East always remember:<br>
1] Always travel in groups of whites.<br>
2] Women should always have White men around them.<br>
3] Women should dress as conservatively as possible. Try wearing Salwar Kameez in India or a similar western outfit. In Egypt, if required wear a burqa. Indeed always wear cloths one step more conservative than the local girls.<br>
4] In india, men should grow moustaches and in the islamic countries, beards. These people give a lot of respect to men with facial hair. </p>
<p>    It is unlikely if white tourists follow the above rules, their women will face any harrasment. And always remember to bargain for everything. Do not let them cheat you.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Kakar is an authority on human behaviour and I asked him why this should be so. &lsquo;The Indian woman is a maa, a beti or a bahu for these men. The white woman, on the other hand, is fair game. She is a whore.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;authority&rdquo; Kakar (sounds like something you wouldn&rsquo;t leave un-flushed in a toilet) needs to get something straight, the only white women who is a &ldquo;whore&rdquo; is one that would willing sleep with or marry one of his kind. Considering the levels of contempt these vile anthropoids express for white women, the adjectives stupid and worthless should qualify exactly the kind of &ldquo;whore&rdquo; she is, if she willing to have any form of intimacy with some Indian male. </p>
<p>The proper response toward the advances of one of these curry Casanovas, was the Romanian student who clobbered the &ldquo;autorickshaw&rdquo;  predator in the head. </p>
<p>In white countries, I think that all decent white women should be armed with tazers or something equally debilitating to deal with the crude and unwelcome advances of the &ldquo;amorous&rdquo; nonwhite male. If they get mouthy or intimidating then, zap, zap, zap; there they are writhing on the floor and mewling like fecklessly wretched baboons they actually are.</p>
<p>Say what you will, but I would bet dollars to doughnuts that it would be a far more effective form of sexually predatory behavior modification for them, then do the various sexual offender &ldquo;cognitive/behavioral restructuring&rdquo; programs in our prisons now!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sexual harassment of women is a worldwide problem. They get their bottoms pinched in Rome. In New York, men on construction sites will make lewd remarks to pretty women passing by.&#8221;</p>
<p>A matter of degree, Huh? I understand the Italian government has taken stern measures to crackdown on the bottom pinching problems. It&rsquo;s interesting that nowhere else in the world are white women treated better than in America and Western Europe,  and yet nowhere else are white males as vilified by feminists as in these same countries. I suggest American women travel to Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and India to observe firsthand these cultures to find out how good they have it at home. However, on second thought, with increased Third World Immigration, I guess our women can observe these cultures right here in places like California and New York?<br>

			<p>Well let&rsquo;s face it, the men of those country are far less likely to face the burden of political correctness.  These nonwhite, low-life men are simply responding to what they have seen of a good many white women and have carried forth that stereotype. It is an extremely disturbing trend, the whorishness of so many white women.  This is played across the internet and in real life scenarios.  A conservative movement by responsible white women is needed and must assert itself if we are to care for our race and give our generation and future generations of white people the dignity they deserve.</p>

			<p>In India the lighter ones skin the higher they are up the Indian social totem pole.  The East Indians being imported as second-rate cheap labor by American corporations are predominantly the dark-skinned untouchable class.  If they didn&rsquo;t speak English they would never be hired.  India ranks right behind Red China in people willing to work for a slave&rsquo;s wage and once Red China produces enough English speakers every American back office job in India will be moved to Red China and India will once again fade into obscurity&hellip;     </p>

			<p>I can tell you that I witness sexual harassment of White females every single day! My advice to White women is this: get a White boyfriend/husband and take him every where with you. If you are walking down the streets of Las Vegas(or any other big city) your life is literally in the hands of non-whites. You are nothing, but a piece of meat to non-whites. You have Larry Flynt and Hugh Hefner to thank for this. Also thank Britney Spears, Anna Nicole Smith and &ldquo;sluts&rdquo; like them.</p>
<p>Posted by Howard in Las Vegas at 4:28 PM on January 30 </p>
<p>I understand the sentiment Howard, but, after years of experience, I respectfully disagree.</p>
<p>As someone who lived most of his life in NYC, and with girlfriends, dates, and a bunch of sisters (very large Irish Catholic family) I am lucky to be alive today.  I feel now that I have nothing to prove and that turning my life into a protector is foolhearty.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget the fact that today most women view chivalry of ANY kind as the behavior of a sucker who tries too hard (says more about them than the men they are judging, and points to the overall decay of manners in the West, but that&rsquo;s another matter).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that it does feel good to have a woman tell you that you&rsquo;re brave.  And any Man living in NYC, and not just in NYC, knows that they will have more than their fair share of opportunities to defend their women from one sort of abuse or another.</p>
<p>But we are living in a time when people with no conscience, low-intelligence, and a compulsion to act out violently, ARE PLACED ABOVE CRITICISM!!!!</p>
<p>Unless you have a gun you don&rsquo;t stand a chance.</p>
<p>I could launch into a long list of anecdotes and maybe in another post I will.  But for now, it&rsquo;s enough to say that I am glad I got out of NYC.</p>
<p>My personal experiences gave me lots of inspiration, not to mention the experiences of those close to me (meanwhile the EVIL NY Times routinely writes love letters to the Offenders in the form of &#8220;news articles&#8221;).</p>
<p>But the worst story was that of a friend whose Mother was living and working in Asia and came to visit him when he was very, very sick. </p>
<p>She flew half way around the world to be with him and after only two days in the City was raped and murdered in her Hotel room in the middle of the day while preparing to go to the Hospital to see her son. Her offender was a black male. No news coverage, and a couple of Police Officers on the case who approaced it like apathetic loafers barely concealing their indifference.</p>
<p>That did it for me.  I feel NOTHING for Blacks, at all.  Or for their Primary Enablers.</p>
<p>But I feel EVERYTHING for ANY White who wants to make something of their life and finds it so hard because we&rsquo;re getting it from all sides and on a daily basis, and from people whose own lives consist of constantly placing demands on others while offering nothing in return. </p>

			<p>A friend of mine has a 19 year old sister who went on holiday to Egypt with her baby daughter and boyfriend. Both the baby and boyfriend have blond hair, which apparently in Egypt is considered very desirable and lucky.</p>
<p>All sorts of strangers would come up to the baby and try and touch her hair. Even her father was sexually pestered by camel-herding boys because of his blond hair, even though homosexuality is illegal in Egypt.</p>
<p>A more amusing story was told to me by my great uncle who lived for many years with his wife in Tenerife. He became heavily tanned and grew a beard and moustache. One day he went into a shop owned by an Indian man, and after purchasing something the shop owner said quietly to him &#8220;you are very lucky to have married a white woman&#8221;!</p>
<p>I am fairly convinced this is one of the cases where such behaviour is culturally conditioned rather than genetic (we all know that the Marxists insist that all other behaviour that reflects badly on non-whites is culturally conditioned, usually by the evil white man both past and present). People are naturally attracted to individuals of their own race. Even within races it has been shown that people tend to be attracted to and have more successful relationships with individuals more similar to themselves in appearance and behaviour. This has also been shown in many animals, such as pigeons which prefer other pigeons of the same colour as their parents (in this case the pigeon is not aware of its own colour, but imprints on its parents). This makes sense from an evolutionary point of view as an individual tends to be adapted to its immediate environment. An individual with very different characteristics is unlikely to be adapted to the same conditions and therefore makes a poorer mate choice.</p>

			<p>RE Sonya&rsquo;s comment<br>
Thousands of English, German, Finnish etc families vacation in India (especially Goa and Kerala) every year and most enjoy their experience that they come back again. I do not deny harassment might occasionally happen but that happens to blonde women who visit Italy, Greece and Japan as well. I would never judge all white men who visit Thailand for sex with young girls or white women who go to Jamaica for sex tourism as representative of whites collectively. As for ARAB/MUSLIM men they only respect THEIR women, a white woman is just a kaffir in his eyes. A British family I knew said in Tunisia the men couldn&rsquo;t stay away from their two teenage girls and that the holiday was hell for that reason. In some western nations like Australia and Sweden the rapes are committed by Middle Eastern youth gangs.    </p>

			<p>This is true. I have worked in Hong Kong as an Engineer. White men go completely crazy over there - the name is yellow fever. Even for white men who would never have considered an Asian women back home. And they treat the Chinese girls like objects. This happened even in the 1950s and 1960s. Chinese girls were referred to as LBFMs - &ldquo;little-brown-you know what-machines.&rdquo;<br>
I have seen white men feel Chinese girls up in nightclubs, grope them and even kiss them on the lips - without the consent of the girl in question.</p>
<p>It is a well known phenomenon of expatriate life in East Asia - white men go for Asian women and eschew white women expats. The white women expats want nothing to do with the local Asian men - so most of them go dateless.</p>
<p>Whites shouldn&rsquo;t get too uptight about how non-whites look at their women. White men treat East Asian women no differently.</p>
<p>If white women were not so brainwashed by feminist propaganda and started acting like women and treated their men as men, maybe white men would act with more confidence and keep their own women away from blacks- and then start themselves staying away from Asian women. Feminism has truly made a mess of things for everyone.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re distorting what is going on a bit.  First of all, white men are doing that because the women egg them on.  After a white man in one of these countries has had 4 or 5 weeks of a different woman every night, they tend to get a bit, presumptuous.  The asian response to this should be, quite naturally, to kick the ass of any man, including whites, that gets that way with his wife, girlfriend, mother, sister etc.  That&rsquo;s normal.  I&rsquo;ll go even further and say it&rsquo;s your duty.  But in the club.  That&rsquo;s the way things are and its not going to change any time soon.  Don&rsquo;t go there.  Definitely, don&rsquo;t go their with a woman.</p>
<p>As far as expat women not wanting asian men, that also is a bit distorted.  Expat women want asian men just fine.  It&rsquo;s asian men who have no interest.  In many ways, western women have the worst aspects of both a slut and a prude  Western men accommodate this, even compensate for this.  Other cultures do not.</p>
<p>This accommodation is a big part of why western men are successful with asian women (other than the direct sex for money trade, I mean).  In most asian countries, only evil men are aggressive.  Sexual aggression and dominance is one of the most important, if not the most important trait that makes a woman of any culture, attracted and turned on to a man.  It&rsquo;s pretty much a cultural universal.  Western white men are different than almost other types of men, including asians.  We are taught to be aggressive, competitive, achievement oriented as part of virtue as well as vice.  In the western world, a man can be sexually dominant and aggressive and also a good person and high quality mate.  A rare combination in most of the world, it&rsquo;s very common, especially in the US.</p>

			<p>I too actually believe that what we consider &#8216;attractive&rsquo; has more to do with cultural rather than genetic conditioning.<br>
Look at the art of ancient China and Japan. The women considered beautiful had puckered up red lips, and very narrow slanty eyes. Also look at the religious statues such as the Buddhas - they are distinctively oriental in appearance - again with narrow eyes.</p>
<p>Round eyes were once considered by the Chinese to have barbarian associations. And the hairy skin of Caucasians was a turn-off (in fact still is to many Chinese men). Chinese use to laugh at the prominent noses of whites and called them &#8220;big nosed&#8221; foreigners.</p>
<p>Now because of Western predominance, many Chinese have changed and view large eyes to be attractive. And just look at the David Beckham mania right across Asia. </p>
<p>Whites, by pushing Hollywood, multi-national status products onto the East are actually, in the long term, creating a rod for their own backs. By portraying everything &#8216;white&rsquo; as desirable, you are indirectly encouraging miscegenation and dilution of the white gene pool on the one hand, and also the destruction of non-white cultures on pride on the other. </p>
<p>And based on Western movies and television alone, any non-white man unfamiliar with the West in other respects, can hardly be blamed for thinking white women are &#8216;easy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hollywood and the Western mass-media in general is causing huge problems for people of all different backgrounds.</p>

			<p>Those who think that most non-white men desire white women above all others are making assumptions clearly not based on the evidence. Most Chinese men find Chinese women to be far more <i>physically</i> attractive than white women (although snaring a white woman does have some status symbol value). They talk of the ageless smooth skin and gentle feminine features of Asian women, compared to the &#8216;mannish&rsquo; aspect of some Western women. Some are appalled by the fact that many white women need to shave their legs. In fact it is quite rare to find Chinese men hitting on white woman, but extremely common for White men to hit on Chinese women.</p>
<p>So objectively speaking (based on Michael Levin&rsquo;s reasoning), Chinese women are more attractive than White women, since the vast majority of  Chinese men prefer Chinese women, many White men like Chinese women, but few Chinese men like white women.</p>
<p>Note that one could also say Chinese cuisine is objectively superior to Western cuisine. Few Chinese enjoy Western cuisine, but a significant number of Westerners enjoy Chinese food.</p>
<p>In music however, Western music is enjoyed and played by vast numbers of Chinese, but few Westerners enjoy Chinese music. So it could be said that Western <i>classical</i> music is superior to Chinese music.</p>

<p>Everywhere white men have gone they have always availed to themselves the sexual services of non-white women - whether it is the Deep South ala Strom Thurmond, Japan, SE Asia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>White men have even bred with Australian aboriginal women for heavens sake. Do you think they went up and aske dthem on a date and shouted them drinks?</p>
<p>White women should just stay away from places like India if they feel there would be a danger of being harassed. And most of all we need to keep these sub-continentals out of white countries. Then problem solved.</p>

<p>And this comment</p>
<p>&#8220;and more often than not the Asian girls find Asian men as unattractive as white women find them&#8221;  </p>
<p>then why is it that in Toronto it is still 95% same race dating?  If the above comment is true, then I should be able to see much higher number of Asian women dating non-Asian men.  But I will agree that there will always be two or three rude/moronic/unintelligent Asian girls who would openly say to people &#8220;I do not find Asian men attractive&#8221;.  And if that is the case, then I will tell every white man, black man, and Asian man around me never to date her until she finds out what she is doing wrong and admits what she is doing wrong.  What she is saying is, basically, &#8220;my dad is ugly, my brother is ugly, my uncle is ugly, my grandpa is ugly, my cousin is ugly&#8221; and she does not deserve to date any man of any ethnicity, and no great man of any ethnicity ever deserves to date such a rude, ignorant person.  </p>
<p>I am currently in love with a white girl, but I would never, ever say I find all Asian women hideous and unintelligent.  I always see fantastic women of all nationalities in Toronto, and I have every bit of respect and I had a sincere gratitude for my grandmother, aunts, female cousins and sisters for who they are and what they teach me and things they do for me and the love they give me.  </p>

Real white Americans are of Northern European origin, and everything that is (or rather was) good about America is directly of Northern Europan, English, Scottish, German and Scandinavian origin. Charles Lindbergh and such people were right, of course. That&rsquo;s all there is to it.</p>
<p>It is also white people like this that are the most liberal, the most affected by feminism, multiculturalism and so on. Read the works of Kevin MacDonald. Northern Europeans are probably genetically more philantropical and even sometimes more naive than other races. We are also the major threat, the really big remaining obstacle, to world domination by the forces of globalism. That is why whites of Northern Europan origin have been the main target of marxism, feminism, liberal political correctness and so on. It is ironic since historically we are by far the ones who have treated our women the best and most fairly. s.</p>

			<p>My family&rsquo;s first encounter with non European men occurred when my Mother took my 11 and 9 year old sisters back east on a Canadien train.  Mom did not want to drive 2,000 miles cross country, but she would need the car when she got to Grandma&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Mom discovered that the Canadien train system had a deal where your car could be shipped on the same train.  Wonderful!!!  A relaxing train trip through lovely Canadien scenery and your car at the end.</p>
<p>The first night my 11 year old blonde sister woke up with an arab train waiter on top of her.  She managed to fight him off before she was raped.  Like many children who are molested, she never told my Mother, so the arab ^#*^* got away with his attempted rape.</p>
<p>That was 20 years ago.  Of course nowadays, if my sister and mother had reported the attempted rape to the authorities, they would probably be charged with hate crime, racism and sentenced to re-education camp.</p>
<p>In my experience, only North western European men treat women decently.  That is where the feminazis go wrong.  They hate and despise North Western European men and worship and exhalt the rapist races such as Africans, Indians, Arabs, and some Pacific Islanders.</p>

			<p>&#8220;My advice to White women is this: get a White boyfriend/husband and take him every where with you. If you are walking down the streets of Las Vegas(or any other big city) your life is literally in the hands of non-whites. You are nothing, but a piece of meat to non-whites.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
One of the happiest days of my life was at the beginning of the 7th month of my first pregnancy.  You know how the baby doesn&rsquo;t show for months and then all of a sudden your abdomen bulges out and it so obvious you are pregnant?</p>
<p>Well, it was great.  I went downtown and did errands all day and not once, not once did one of the dark races harass me. I had 2 kids in 2 years and took them with me everywhere for the next 18 years.  Children protect Mothers from harassement Thank God!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Another tip, eyes on the ground at all times.  Never look at them or they will take advantage.</p>

<p><i>It is spelled Northern Europan Germanic culture and genes!</i></p>
<p><i>This is normal among most non-whites, especially in the Arab world. It also is quite common among the swarthier regions of Southern Europe though. It really is a descending scale of whiteness and goodness from the north down.</i></p>
<p>Also the constant waxing lyrical over blonde hair and blue eyes is getting mighty tiresome. Are we a race-realist site or a Nordicist site?</p>
<p>In terms of sexual depravity it is funny how it is mainly Northern Europeans who get off on child-sex. And Scandinavians and Germans are renown for bad behaviour in South-East Asia - never Italians or other Latins.</p>

<p>Yup, that&rsquo;s good old white bashing for you. Make it sound like only caucasian man are sexual deviants when non-caucasians really monopolize this behaviour, as Drew&rsquo;s posted clearly indicated.(Have you ever heard of a 6 year old turkish girl getting her rear pinched in Germany or Sweden by the natives? I think not, that&rsquo;s a non-white exclusive right there.)</p>
<p>Just look at the rape and other sexual crimes statistics around the world, especially in caucasian countries. The numbers speak for themselves.</p>
<p>And what about that Canadian child who disappeared in Portugal this year?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of the world but here in Montreal greeks, italians and mediterraneans in general are notorious gropers.<br>

			<p>I am an average looking, medium dark and of medium height Indian/American that came here about 40 years ago and my experiences have been that I was the one who was approached by white women both single and married on multiple occasions, including a married woman coming to my apartment in her neglige on my first night in my first appartment. I married the only white woman that I ever asked out on a date, all of the others just came to me to have sex. I am not a hunk but am a professional and am perceived to make a good income. Western women have been too sexualised and this is the price they pay. Vast majority of porn stars are whites and so are people flashing their racks on the internet. I am appalled at the number of men who put their own wife&rsquo;s naked pictures on the net. Sorry but you won&rsquo;t find an Indian man doing that to his wife.  My Indian friends who have spent time among the Nordics in Scandinavia while attending graduate school or working say that they hardly ever slept in a cold bed while there. Eastern European women throng to Bombay to prostitute and take back money to Romania or where ever to start their own boutiques. Back during the hippie era a lot of Westerners went to India for dope and sustained themselves by whoring, just a fact, braless gauze skirts and tops etc mostly in Goa. It would be interesting to find out about the rate of rapes in different countries, also of incest which to the best of my knowledge is highest among whites. The phrase for picking on women that is commonly used by the law in India is &#8220;Eve teasing&#8221; and has existed for quite sometime and the teasing was done to Indian girls/women.  This happens because boys and girls are segregated in school and boys don&rsquo;t really know how to approach girls/women. Western men and women need to start truly respecting themselves and not have Paris, Britany etc be their icons. It is not your race that matters it is your behavior.   </p>

			<p>I saw a post a while back that angrily mentioned how many american/white women are considered to be &#8216;wh@res&rsquo; by foreign men due to the women not having much respect for their bodies and for their lack of modesty. I concur with that poster. </p>
<p>I am appalled by white girls&rsquo; behavior during spring break, while they travel, and their wild early sexual habits. Older white women going on sex tours to black and hispanic countries is a disgrace. This sends the wrong message to the younger generation. BTW, the males&rsquo; behaviors have a lot to be desired but the women used to keep the males in check but now there is nothing to keep the boys marrying the girls since they just put out.</p>
<p>Another poster Violet mentioned that most white women are not slutty and that it is media portrayal of white women. But I disagree with that view. My experience has been that many average white women are sexually promiscuous and behave wildly at home and abroad especially when falling down drunk. The women prowling the bars looking to pickup men is considered to be a norm in most parts of the US. Many women consider one night stands to be a notch in their sexual conquest belt. How grotesqe. I heard all this when my friends&rsquo; college age nieces were discussing &#8216;boys&rsquo; and through personal observation.</p>
<p>I am ashamed of many, but not all of average white women&rsquo;s behavior and wish that this could change. White culture used to be modest, conservative, and very careful of one&rsquo;s behavior and dress. Culturally we have to root out this disease of immodesty, crudeness, excessive drinking, and early sexualization of boys and girls from our media and schools. </p>
<p>Research has shown that it is unhealthy for teens to become sexually active early. How can the parents be so indifferent and permissive. Oh right, many of them were pot smoking loosy goosy whatever goes hippies in the 60s, 70s, and even now. </p>

But at least they marry mostly capable men with money, unlike English and American women who go with blacks for sex and to appear non &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, of course you have mostly &#8220;Germanic types&#8221; when you&rsquo;re speaking about Belgium and Nordic countries. However, I suspect that the reason you hear about &#8220;Belgium and the Nordic countries is because these are precisely those countries where it&rsquo;s outlawed and they&rsquo;re seriously trying to stamp it out.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in Africa, India, much of the Arab world, etc. it&rsquo;s simply taken for granted and given no attention.  Just because there&rsquo;s no hullabaloo about it in Yemen, Pakistan, Thailand or Nigeria doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t going on there.<br>

<p>I agree with this. Civilization requires restraint. We have lost some of this and one of the reasons could be the rise of black influenced popular culture and music. Primitive tribes lack sexual restraint, go round unclothed and the women display their breasts. Due to black influence, white women have recently tilted towards this type of behaviour. Civilized peoples, <i>especially</i> the women, do not go round thinking of sex every waking minute. Our American culture is now suffused with sexual enticements. And most of us do not even realise it because it has been with us most of our lives. But most do not realize is that this over-sexualization of society can be related to blacks and their jazz and their rock and roll.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I am appalled at the number of men who put their own wife&rsquo;s naked pictures on the net.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been living in Canada for a few years by now and I have never heard of a white husband or any husband doing that to his own wife around me.  What you see on the internet is full of dishonesty, built by money-greedy businessmen.  There are video clips where two men drive around towns in a truck and they approach women randomly and pay them money to have intercouse with the men.  And guess what, these are all set-ups.  The women in those clips are porn actresses.   </p>
<p>And if you think it is white American women&rsquo;s fault that they are harassed by foreign men, then aren&rsquo;t you being ridiculous?  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say there is a young white woman and her skirt is a little bit short.  Does that make her a wh*re?  If a non-white man harasses her simply because she was wearing a short skirt or sleeveless blouse, then are you honestly going to say it is the woman&rsquo;s fault?  &#8220;I harassed her or raped her because her arms were exposed.  I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.  It is totally her fault&#8221;  Isn&rsquo;t that a muslim point of view?  Do you want to hear one more thing about the radical muslims?  They stone women to death after she is raped.  </p>
<p>Especially in North America, It is a woman&rsquo;s right to wear what she wants, and it is a man&rsquo;s responsibility to respect her right.  There was a thread similar to this one, the Iranian Ph D student who harassed the girl in Canada recently.  Can we honestly say the man did not do anything wrong?  Can we say it is all her fault because she must have been wearing a little bit revealing outfit?  I have seen a plenty of white women, black women and Asian women in unbelievably revealing outfits, but did I once lose control or did I ever harass her because of her revealing outfit?  NO~!!!!  I have to be very careful too because the police officers started to be merciless towards East Asian males just the way they are towards white males.  I told women they are very beautiful openly and directly countless times, I sometimes kissed their hands and kissed their cheeks very carefully and politely, and many times I received one back on my cheek, and but not once, not once did I ever sexually harass a woman in my life or lose control simply because she was wearing a revealing outfit.  Sexual harassment, or sexual assault, is never the victim&rsquo;s fault.  That is the radical muslim point of view.  The circumstance or the victim&rsquo;s outfit can influence how harsh the punishment will be on the criminal, but it is never the victim&rsquo;s fault.  I do not care if there is a woman completely naked in front of me.  I should never ever sexually harass her.</p>

<p> Incest is not highest in the western world but in the Arabic regions. At least a third of all marriages in the middle east are between FIRST-cousins. Pakistanis in Britain have the highest levels of family-kin marriage and corresponding birth defects.</p>
<p> You also say Whites commit the most rapes. WRONG. Blacks are in a class all by themselves in this domain.</p>
<p> Finally I really, really, really doubt all those beautiful Nordic women were just dying to jump into bed with your Indian buddies. Most Indian males are socially inept dopes, (but think they are all that).</p>

<p>Absolutely true. Most whites find this horrifying but many of these brown people don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that big of a deal. I heard some middle eastern men say they don&rsquo;t understand why in America we make such a big deal about men having sex with underage girls. They were grinning lewdly and suggesting that the younger ones were the best for sex. It was absolutely disgusting and sad that we are importing these low IQ creatures.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, the only people with stronger sexual morals than us are the e. asians. I&rsquo;ve talked to Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans and they were absolutely against perversions such as underage sex or even pre-marital sex. </p>
<p>I found out that most asian kids were not sexually active as teens when I first started working with them. Even the troubled kids were focused on making something of themselves and had to be helped to see themselves as not being failures for not being as academic as other asian kids. If these troubled asian kids were black, hispanic, or white, they would be considered a success in their group. It completely opened my eyes as to the difference in the groups.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that we or the asians are perfect but the majority don&rsquo;t accept these types of backward tribal attitudes towards sexual behavior. We are beyond these types of issues. let&rsquo;s not import these backward people who have not developed enough to join our society!</p>

Dear Guru, you are appalled at the number of men who put their own wife&rsquo;s naked pictures on the net. &#8220;Sorry but you won&rsquo;t find an Indian man doing that to his wife&#8221; - True, you indians have more pragmatic approach to women. The numbers speak for themselves. There are some thousands of women killed in india only because they turn down your grand offer to  marry them. Half a million of them are killed at birth every  year. Violence against women  is so omnipresent and brutal  in india that even indian government had to enact special emergency laws just to address this issue. And you are not appalled at such widespread barbarism all over inda? Well it speaks volumes about your nature despite your western education. Indians behaving so rudely with western women is just new outlet for their thousands of years old, deep ingrained lust. Just because there was not anything like this few decades ago it only means there was no media attention. Thanks to our technology india is exposed as being as much violent and barbaric as it has been for millenia.<br>
And you have the nerve to say..  &#8221; Western men and women need to start truly respecting themselves and not have Paris, Britany etc be their icons. It is not your race that matters it is your behavior.&#8221;<br>
I say you need to stop indulging in your phony holiness and start respecting your women. Because it is not your race but your behavior that matters.</p>

			<p>I am glad I wrote something provocative and made a few people fume. I am an American and I care and that&rsquo;s what makes me write occasionally on this site.</p>
<p>To the person who wrote at 7.29 AM on Feb 04:  You are absolutely right about infanticide and female abortion in India, which also happens in China, and they are absolutly  appalling (we of course have our own abortion issues).  Me thinks that both of those cultures have a rude awakening coming and are going to see a huge cultural shift because of an extreme shortage of women.  I hope it will also drastically change Indian attitudes about dowry and the dowry murders, and Chinese attitudes about one child.  Sorry if I was sounding sanctimonius about respecting each other but don&rsquo;t you think we ought to do that? Sorry I don&rsquo;t think there is any pent up lust among the darkies just a look at easy and cheap, plenty of lusy here, female teachers etc..</p>
<p>My comments about Britany, et al were referring to our youth being so overly sexualised.  This is a result of our movies, television, left over permissiveness of the 60s and 70s, etc etc.</p>
<p>For those of you that got exorcised about my incest comment, I was particularly refering to fathers molesting daughters.  Sharia law, to the best of my knowledge, allows marriage between half sibs not just first cousins - &#8220;as long as they don&rsquo;t share the same milk (mother&rsquo;s boosom)&#8221; - muslims correct me if I am wrong.  Some of that it also Biblically accepted, pastors and priests can call me on this one.  Granted in some societies they have rationalized the acceptance of these close marriages for their own reasons (ie European royalty).<br>
 <br>
7.29 AM, all of my education is from India FYI, I was invited here as an exchange scientist and stayed on because the roads were better and so were the cars, love Porches, my last 911 S 0-60 5.64 secs.  Actually because funding and the political attitude towards research was much better here than in India, unfortunately it is not so any more, another story another time. </p>
<p>This site has had many a postings maligning Indians, however they in my humble opinion tend to ignore facts that a lot of the scientists, doctors, college deans and CEO&rsquo;s( CEO of Pepsico) in the US are Indians. The richest man in the world not Mr Microsoft. Six of the fourty junior Nobel Price contestants are of Indian extraction, just facts nothing else. By the way 7.29 I am just as fluent in about nine more languages and logically consistant.</p>
<p>To Korean guy:  I didn&rsquo;t say anything about revealing clothes being a license to molest.  What I was talking about was a perception of being easy because that was the issue at hand -  nobody confers dignity upon you, one brings it on their own.  I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re such a gentlemen.  But do you mean to tell me you&rsquo;ve never come across a woman, no matter how she was dressed, who behaved in a less than lady-like manner towards men? Did you notice that 7.29 aggrees with me about husband&rsquo;s putting their wife&rsquo;s nude pictures on the net?  </p>
<p>11.32 No, I catagorically did not say that most rapes were comitted by whites, more precisely I begged the question as to who commited the most rapes and from my information yes, you are probabbly right about the black&rsquo;s, however, our politically correct media etc doesn&rsquo;t bring it up and most of you whites are handcuffed and tounge tied. About a hundred white women are raped by blacks to every single black that is raped by a white roughly. I am trying for reason and personally have no racial aspirations, I already know I belong to the human race.</p>
