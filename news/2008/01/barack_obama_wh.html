<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Barack Obama may not be the first African American to run for president, but he is certainly the first who is being taken seriously. When the media&rsquo;s anointed one lost narrowly in New Hampshire following his shock victory in Iowa, and after having a clear lead over Hillary Clinton in the days before polling, it was almost as if somebody had died. Not only were the pollsters humiliated, but the TV, radio and newspaper commentators who had touted his presidential ambitions were hugely embarrassed. Having declared Obama as the Democratic candidate sans pareil, they suddenly discovered that there was life in the Clinton campaign yet, and that this primary season was to be a real contest. </p>
<p>What has changed that allows an African American to be a serious candidate?  Does it mean the end of race as a political issue in American politics, or is something else afoot? </p>
<p>Obama follows in the footsteps of Dick Gregory (1968), Shirley Chisholm (1972), Jesse Jackson (1984 and 1988) and Reverend Al Sharpton (2004) in challenging for the presidency. Chisholm and Jackson made a decent showing of it, but none were near being nominated. </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s campaign got off to a slow start. He failed to gain early support among blacks, but that was largely due to the fact that the junior senator from Illinois had less name recognition than the junior senator from New York. That&rsquo;s hardly surprising, given Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s provenance. But once he became the media darling, and the subject of a pseudo-coronation as the man who could orate America back to pre-eminence, that all changed. </p>
<p>Obama has had to work hard to gain support from the old-school black leaders, and in some cases has not tried too hard. Some of them derided Obama for not being black enough. Ever the insider, Clinton quickly gained support from the traditional powerhouses in the Democratic machine, civil rights leader Andrew Young, Congressman John Lewis from Georgia, business leader Vernon Jordan, basketball star Magic Johnson, music producer Quincy Jones and others. Meanwhile, Obama has gone out of his way to court non-traditional black leaders. Not for him the Al Sharptons and religious black leaders from the South. Oprah, Jay Z and Kanye West are more his style. This is a somewhat dangerous strategy, given that young people are not historically great at turning out to vote. However, the excitement about his candidacy is palpable, and dinner-party conversations about him verge on the hagiographic, among young and not-so-young liberal Democrats, black and white. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like all other sections of society, blacks want their guy to win, and if they perceive that Obama can carry the day will support him. If it appears that Clinton will carry the day, then she will get their support. The reality is that come November, blacks will overwhelmingly support the Democratic candidate. Many strategists are convinced America has moved on from looking at a candidate&rsquo;s colour when deciding for whom to vote. Just as Oprah, Jay-Z and Kanye West have huge numbers of white fans, so does Obama. As in any other election in any country, there are some voters who will never vote for a woman or a minority candidate. But as David Bositis, of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, told the New Yorker: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that white people are not going to vote for a black candidate. That is so yesterday.&rsquo; (6) </p>
<p>Bositis is right. A significant majority of people do look far beyond a candidate&rsquo;s race or gender when deciding whether to vote for him or her. But Obama&rsquo;s candidacy reflects a lot more than that. Many white liberals feel that his success in coming this far &mdash; and especially if he wins &mdash; tells us so much about how the United States feels about itself. David Greenberg called him the &lsquo;great white hope&rsquo;, and quoted social critic John McWhorter as saying: &lsquo;What gives people a jolt in their gut about the idea of President Obama is the idea that it would be a ringing symbol that racism no longer rules our land.&rsquo; (7) </p>
<p>The reality is that white America has more invested in this candidate than does black America. </p>
<p>Given the way the campaign has been run so far, it&rsquo;s a bizarre thought that if Clinton wins, she will be more beholden to African Americans than Obama will be if he wins. She will owe them in a way that Obama will never do. If Obama is the candidate, we can safely expect black Americans to vote in unprecedented numbers, but he will owe them nothing because he is black. Hillary, on the other hand, while she may not have to rely on them to win the presidency if she is the eventual candidate, will need many black votes to beat Obama in the first place, so will owe them big time. </p>
<p>The fact is that Obama&rsquo;s race matters more to whites than it does to blacks. Race is still a huge issue in America, but in a very different way than before. Today, white liberals have more invested in Obama than do African Americans. And for that reason, if he is not the eventual nominee it will hurt them. But not as much as if he is the nominee and falls to some no-mark Republican. That, for liberals, will confirm the endemic racism they see everywhere, ignoring the fact that it is Obama&rsquo;s race, not his qualities as a leader, that they most love about him themselves. <br>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;it is Obama&rsquo;s race, not his qualities as a leader, that they most love about him themselves.&#8221; </p>
<p>This quote describes very well the huge number of White Liberals I know who support Obama.  They talk about vague things like hope and change without ever giving specific details about what is good for or bad for the USA. </p>
<p>Most avoid mentioning his race at any point during our conversations as if they know very well that his Blackness is the only reason they like him so much.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s campaign is being run on the sentiment &#8220;Hey look at me, I&rsquo;m a Black man.  Vote for me or you are a bad, evil, backwards person.&#8221;  The spineless White Liberals can&rsquo;t weather such condemnation and thus fall in lock step with the least experienced but most politically correct candidate in the whole race.</p>
<p>The Democrat&rsquo;s level of anti-White male campaigning however, is unusual.  The political fallout from this could be massive if Liberal White males percieve that they have a second class future in Liberal politics.  Perhaps they will continue to take delight in their mental slavery to morally &#8220;superior&#8221; men and women, but I doubt it will last very long.  They have been shamed into servitude and will be increasingly ready to hear that they deserve more reward for doing more work than others.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all get out and spread the word.</p>

Have you seen Ted Kennedy gushing over Obama?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a guy who lives the life of a patrician elite in lilly-white Hyannis Port and who sees himself as the champion of the dark-skinned and alleged-oppressed.</p>
<p>Kennedy is the embodiment of white liberalism. I can only imagine that in his mind he truly believes he&rsquo;s the man who can save Americas soul by ending &#8216;racism&rsquo; all the while living in two dream worlds; his guarded white enclaves and the fantasy of racial harmony. He may not have to live with dark people but by goodness, he&rsquo;s going to ensure that every white American has the opportunity to experience blacks at every turn.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll go to his graving believing, in the end, that the future America will thank him for all he&rsquo;s done.</p>

			<p>Those of you who may have attended high school and/or college in the early to mid 70s KNOW that there is a huge amount of truth in this article.  I know it was true in my Texas high school *and* college, which were both 98 percent White, that it became the chic thing to do to seek out a black or mex student to name as &#8220;Favorite&#8221;, &#8220;Prom Queen&#8221;, or the like.  All those &#8220;kids&#8221; have brought their teenager values with them into their 50s and 60s and the black senior class &#8220;favorite&#8221; is now about to be tagged as President of the U.S.A, just so these self righteous fools can feel good about themselves being &#8220;color blind&#8221;.  </p>

			<p>Obama appeals only to white liberal chumps. After Bill and Bush 2, the presidency is pretty much of a joke. If Hillary or Obama win it will be just another signpost on the road of decline. Too bad I won&rsquo;t be around to read the history of America&rsquo;s final decline into third world status but I am sure it will track closely with the complexion of the presidents.</p>

			<p>Obama is the high water mark for blacks.  In 2012, the population of hispanics eligible to vote will almost certainly greatly outnumber black voters, and that will be it for black political power.  As others have posted on these pages, demographics is destiny.  </p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s a media creation who appeals mostly to white liberals. He&rsquo;s a &#8220;safe black&#8221;  &mdash;  at least he&rsquo;s been presented that way  &mdash;  and his main appeal is based almost entirely on white guilt. White liberals can demonstrate their enlightenment and supposed indifference to race by supporting Obama, though the race factor is really his main attraction. It can&rsquo;t be his position on issues. Does anyone actually know what those are? He&rsquo;s marketing himself as the candidate of &#8220;change.&#8221; As far as I can tell, he&rsquo;s just a typical establishment candidate running on meaningless abstractions.</p>
<p>Lately, though, he&rsquo;s been drawing in more black voters strictly on the basis of race. Blacks vote for him because he&rsquo;s a black Democrat. That&rsquo;s all it amounts to. If Hillary Clinton gets the nomination, they&rsquo;ll vote for her because they always vote democratic regardless of the candidate. Obama&rsquo;s skin color was the major factor in his winning South Carolina, but the more he becomes identified as &#8220;the black candidate,&#8221; the less chance he has of winning the nomination, never mind the general election. And Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s endorsement couldn&rsquo;t have helped him much. I mean, would you support anybody who was endorsed by Ted Kennedy?</p>

			<p>The media is in Obama&rsquo;s pocket: his wrongs and slips are easily explained away (slum landlord connection, inanities about the Middle East, etc.), his coverage is warm and fuzzy with few if any indiscreet questions about his bi-racial, dysfunctional family (that he sugar-coated in his autobiography), Muslim affinities (enrolled in two private schools as a Muslim), stunning lack of administrative experience, disconnect with the military (does he even know how to fire a rifle?), abandoned by his mother during his teen years (raised by White grandparents in Hawaii), a polygamous, philandering father who was hardly the icon that Obama celebrates, his naivete towards Iran and the sectarian tribal feuds in the area, and we could go on and on.  If indeed he is elected president, this will be an unnerving apprenticeship of power.  The analogy with JFK that daughter Caroline has been dredging up is faint at best.  This would be another post entirely.  </p>
<p>Hillary looks attractive by comparison. She will be beholden not only to the blacks but also the Hispanics who will assure her victory in key states.  McCain cannot pursue the path he is on and expect to gain the crossover vote needed for victory.  It&rsquo;s a pick&rsquo;em election.</p>
<p>  The next four years will be difficult for readers of AR.  Gird your loins.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What has changed that allows an African American to be a serious candidate? Does it mean the end of race as a political issue in American politics, or is something else afoot?&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously this bigot assumes that it is only whites that have voted their own race, completely oblivious to the fact that black candidates have won many times in majority sectors, but white candidates in mostly black areas have not.  To assume that a majority of blacks or Hispanics will vote for a white in their districts over one of their own is the height of naivete and the depths of stupidity.</p>
<p>The country is degenerating further, as Pat Buchanan so aptly describes in his many writings, and it is appearing more and more certain as time goes by that we have accelerated well beyond the point of no return.  </p>
<p>Today we no longer have a country.  It is, as Roosevelt warned, &#8220;a boardinghouse of squabbling nationalities,&#8221;  which has assumed empire status.  And, unfortunately, the center, getting ever smaller and smaller, cannot and will not hold.<br>
We&rsquo;re in the final days of the Roman empire.</p>

			<p>This morning my path crossed an Obama rally.  My commuter line is right outside the College that hosted the rally. A very large and excited crowd, young, more females then men and yes, predominately white, very predominately white.  I don&rsquo;t&rsquo; necessarily blame these young people after eight years of  George W Bush.  But to witness this &ldquo;white&rdquo; crowd riding high on emotion, but clearly deluded by years of PC public education, years of being fed the propaganda of the media elite is truly depressing.  Well they ever wake up? Does it take getting assaulted, robed, raped or slain by person of color?  Do you wake up when they take your job?  When will reality ever seep in, after they have robbed you of your will, ambition, creatively, all the wealth you have created for yourself, community and nation?  All this, stripped from you, by those who never created or shared anything of real worth. Sorry, I&rsquo;m still shaking my head in disgust. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see what the big fuss is, really. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly be any more anti-white than Hillary Clinton or John McCain or even the idiot we&rsquo;ve already got in the White House, Jorge &#8220;The First Mestizo President&#8221; Boosh. </p>
<p>I hope he wins. </p>

			<p>For some time, all over America, in our schools and universities, our mainstream news media, blacks have been pushed upon American society, especially the younger generations, their overwhelming short comings, have been ignored, white washed, explained away, condoned by society because their ancestors were so oppressed, and now we maybe looking at the American people electing a totally unqualified, very possibly a racist, and certainly someone who would favor ignoring our constitution and becoming an even more socialist country, all because his skin is dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a great symbolic action it would be to have a black president! What a great symbol!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Its about time for a black president.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he would be good, you need something new.&#8221; </p>

Here is a video of the good Rev Wright giving his churches yearly life acchivement award to his mentor and morale compass Louis Farrakhan. <br>

<p>Well, I predicted long ago that most blacks would vote along racial lines for Obama. You don&rsquo;t need to be a genius to predict this. John Browne is either naive or blindsided. The black vote was almost 80% for Obama in South Carolina. I know Oprah likes Senator Obama because he is from Illinois. </p>
<p>Are guilt-ridden liberal whites voting for Obama because he is black  &mdash;  Yes. Are blacks voting for Obama because he is black  &mdash;  Yes again. Where is this guy coming from?</p>

			<p>Yup, a lot of White people like blacks. Esecially here in NJ. Of course they&rsquo;re deranged, but that&rsquo;s the way things are anymore. Maybe obama actually can win the nomination. I can&rsquo;t figure out in my mind which would be worse in the White House, him or Billary. That&rsquo;s a tough one.</p>

			<p>Here is my take on the near future: If Hussein loses to Hilary in the primaries, blacks will boycott the election. They will NEVER vote for a white male republican and they will hate Hilary for denying Hussein the &#8220;right&#8221; to be president. They will stay at home since, as children, they will pout. There will be violence.</p>
<p>They will NOT eat their breakfast.</p>
<p>For Hilary to re-gain (re-purchase) the Canadian vote, she will have to have Obama as Vice-President. That will guarantee many white  democrats to either stay at home or vote Republican. She will probably give up as many white votes as she gains by making the canadain VP. There are numberous democrats who are &#8220;racist&#8221; but don&rsquo;t know it (yet).</p>
<p>Plus, with a canadian VP, Hilary  may have to fear for her situation. Could there be blacks angry and insane enough to want Hussein to gain the Presidency by having Hilary out of the way? I am sure they talk about this ALL THE TIME.</p>
<p>If the canadian is on the Democommie ticket, the vast majority of whites, cubans and a huge segment of Mexicans, will vote republican. I feel, knowing what I do about Mexicans, is that they would prefer a white president rather than a canadian. Cubans as well know a canadain president will be bad for their tribe and the cubans can get more goodies from the white tribe.</p>
<p>In any case, if Obama can not become THE president, you will see alot of hostile and angry blacks in the next few months. If the Democommie convention is roudy, and if Obama is close to winning, but does not, I can see some real racial (canadian) vjiolence resulting from the white lady denying Hussein the right to be President. All this bodes ill for the Democommies now and in the future.</p>
<p>If they insult the canadia voters, that is a good thing. If we can elliminate them in the voting process, that leave a bit more power to the whites. SInce I feel Hussein will not make it to the Presidency, nor be picked as VP, this may be the last election where blacks vote. They will turn to the streets and riot as they do in EVERY African nation when their tribe can&rsquo;t steal the election.</p>
<p>Our future is going to be very interesting, as the Chinese would say.</p>
<p>One more question, if Hussein gets the Democratic Presidetial nomination, will he chose a white VP?</p>

<p>There is a difference. We didn&rsquo;t actually want to. The US and the rest of the significant West were applying sanctions against us and threatening a military invasion.</p>

			<p>&#8220;can&rsquo;t be his position on issues. Does anyone actually know what those are? He&rsquo;s marketing himself as the candidate of &ldquo;change.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes. Here from South Africa I also picked up his almost hysterical bleating about &#8220;change&#8221;. I also wonder. Change to what? Is the American populace really that mindless?</p>

			<p>&#8220;If Barrack Obama has a white mother and black father, why is he called an AFrican-American?&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, Obama really is an African-American.</p>
<p>He is a half-breed between his black African (born in Kenya) father and his white American mother.</p>

			<p>What disturbs me about Obama is not his race, but somethimg else. A candidate for presidency of the USA must be born in the USA. The reason is not some miraculous chemical property of US soil which makes a baby born there automatically fit for president, but the idea that the president should not have too close ties to a foreign country, neither enviromental nor genetic ties. He should noz have parents who are foreigners and live in a foreign country, and he should not have siblings who are foreigners and live in a foreign contry. Obama&rsquo;s father was a Kenyan, and he has several half-brothers and half-sisters who live in Kenya, not to mention uncles, aunts and cousins. Now. Kenya is on the brink of a civil war between the tribes of the Kikuyu and the Luo. Obama&rsquo;s father was a Luo.<br>
If a civil war really breaks out, will the USA intervene? Remember, Clinton intervened in Somalia, I don&rsquo;remember for which reason, nor do 99.9% of Americans, including Clinton himself. Whatever, the intervention cost American lives and some billions in money without resulting in anything beneficial. Will a president Obama intervene in a civil war in Kenya, and on which side? If, for political and moral reasons (I don&rsquo; know anything about Kenian inner politics, but anything is possible) it would be better for the US to intervene on the Kikuyu side, will these reasons be stronger than Obama&rsquo;s loyalty to his fathers tribe?<br>
These are the questions which every voter should ask himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yup, a lot of White people like blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much as they like blacks, it&rsquo;s that they don&rsquo;t like themselves very much. They&rsquo;re looking for absolution for their white guilt&hellip;even if they have to shoot themselves in the head to achieve it. Only white people (of which I&rsquo;m one) are capable of diving into the deep end of self defeating absurdity.<br>

			<p>Obama is stridently pro gun-control. He sits on the board of directors of the Joyce Foundation, an organization that is pro gun-control,and gives millions of dollars to gun-control causes and politicians.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s wife recently stated that she could see why people living in rural areas needed guns for protection - but said nothing about why people in urban areas would need them. Obama himself, thinks the Second Amendment is about hunting.</p>
<p>An Obama regime would be like Ray Nagin&rsquo;s in New Orleans, when Katrina hit. Need I say more?</p>
<p>&#8220;Any politician that spits on the right of the people to defend themselves, is unfit to govern a free people.&#8221;  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Many strategists are convinced America has moved on from looking at a candidate&rsquo;s colour when deciding for whom to vote.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Those strategists are wrong. No presidential election has ever been MORE about color than this one. Obama&rsquo;s white supporters aren&rsquo;t &#8220;colorblind&#8221;   &mdash;   on the contrary, they are judging him by his color first and foremost. His color is the very REASON they support him. They have been duped into the wishful thinking that a black (or at least nonwhite) president would finally bring blacks into the American family: make them stop committing crime, stop dropping out of school, get off welfare, and allow them to (belatedly) achieve their full potential. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t need to convince anybody here that no such general transformation among African Americans will take place even if BHO were to win by the biggest landslide in history. </p>
<p>What self-hating white Obamaniacs don&rsquo;t understand is that &#8220;full potential&#8221; for blacks, well, it just ain&rsquo;t all that full. If blacks truly had the same potential as whites, we would surely have seen more of it by now. </p>
<p>Putting one of their own in the Oval Office can&rsquo;t make blacks more than what they are. It won&rsquo;t help them. But it would surely hurt the rest of us. <br>

			<p>If an Obama were ever appointed to the White House by our communist shadow government American blacks might become intoxicated with what they perceive to be their having attained the ultimate power and go on a rampage of death and destruction against all other races as happens periodically in Africa when blacks take power from whites.</p>

			<p>I heard some of Obama&rsquo;s early writings quoted today on a radio talk show, and indeed he is a stealth anti-white racist.  His last book was written after he realized that the truthful depictions he made earlier that were anti-white would harm his chances for getting elected, so he embarked on a journey to create a paper trail that was meant to give the impression he had now resolved his racial issues and was not only in the Christian camp, but he was dedicated to bringing the races together as well.<br>
   Even his religion has been changed to a more electable one in a country of Christians.  But is he the &#8220;666&#8221; the religious community has been watching for?  Is this the &#8220;mark of the beast&#8221; they fear who fools the world into thinking of unity when his ulterior motive&rsquo;s are pure evil in and of themselves?  He certainly fits the picture created by the religious sector.</p>
<p>These are valid questions, because if any politician has left a trail easy to follow and decipher as to intent it is this man.  And this trail unequivocally points to a man who will say anything and do anything to realize his goals.  Of course Hillary is the same, but, unlike her, this man gives every indication that he wants the presidency STRICTLY for pushing anything and everything that will give even more privileges to blacks.  Everything else to him is secondary, INCLUDING national security. To him, coming together and &#8220;change&#8221; mean doing anything and everything possible to elevate blacks, especially black males.<br>
   However, whether it is reading the tenants of his adopted &#8220;curch,&#8221; or the racist rants and writings of his spiritual advisor and his embrace of the radical Louis Farrakhan, it is obvious that Obama is ad libbing much of his lines and actions as he goes along, things that haven&rsquo;t been &#8220;spun&#8221; enough to negate and can be easily seen for what they really are, because the image he wants people to believe is really him is very easy for an astute person to reject and realize that who this man really is is how he defined himself in those years he had no ambition for the Senate or the presidency. </p>
<p>And 666?  Personally I think he is far more dangerous than that.</p>

			<p>David Greenberg called him the &lsquo;great white hope&rsquo;, and quoted social critic John McWhorter as saying: &lsquo;What gives people a jolt in their gut about the idea of President Obama is the idea that it would be a ringing symbol that racism no longer rules our land.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The majority of blacks are voting for Obama. In Nevada it was 4 out of 5 blacks supporting him. I guess it is racism if whites dont vote for a black candidate. But what do we call it when the vast majority of blacks dont vote for a white candidate? </p>

			<p>I look at the field of presidential candidates, and when Obama speaks, I think: &#8220;OK, the adults are done talking now.&#8221;  When compared to McCain, or even Romney, Obama does not come across as an adult.</p>

			<p>On a smaller scale, white liberals had the same reaction when the people of Minneapolis elected Sharon Sayles-Belton as the city&rsquo;s first black mayor several years ago. Anyway, she quickly turned out to be a hugely unqualified, inarticulate embarrassment and an eco-liberal white male was elected in the next election. So the white liberals got what they wanted and then got burned. It is improbable the lesson will stick over the long term but I think the same thing will happen to the first half-black, white-raised presidential candidate Obama.</p>

			<p>This is total baloney.</p>
<p>Obama and Clinton both played identity politics. White feminists vote for Clinton and blacks vote for Obama. End of story.</p>
<p>Obama is in absolutely no danger of being the nominee of the Democratic party, simply because of the numbers. The two biggest states that vote Democrat in Presidential elections is New York and California. Duh! Democrats in New York have elected Clinton twice to the US Senate, and they are unlikely to turn their back on their Senator now. California is ONLY 6 percent black. Hispanics are not going to leave Clinton to vote for the black candidate. Without New York or California, Obama has no chance whatsoever.</p>
<p>Does not matter who won South Carolina. That state has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1964, except for the 1976 election (Jimmy Carter). What purpose is served to win the Democratic primary (or caucus) in a state that always gives it electoral votes to the Republican nominee??? To win in November, the Democratic nominee must win the electoral votes of every blue state won by Al Gore and John Kerry&hellip;.and more. I seriously doubt Clinton (or Obama) can pull it off.<br>

			<p>A lot of naive White liberals hope by voting for Obama blacks will see how they are not racist and hopefully stop blaming Whites for their failings. They hope blacks will have some kind of magical change of heart and behave more civilly. Wishful thinking.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If Barrack Obama has a white mother and black father, why is he called an AFrican-American?&#8221; (Posted by at 8:30 PM on January 30).</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s obviously not white (racially liberal whites not yet having been allowed by blacks to give up the very notion of &#8220;white&#8221; itself), and in our &#8220;two party&#8221; racial classification system for blacks and whites, black is the only other classification available.</p>
<p>Blacks are a little more refined in their classifications than whites are: many blacks who hate whites still respect light-skinned (i.e., &#8220;whitened&#8221;) blacks more than they respect dark-skinned blacks.</p>
<p>Our &#8220;two party&#8221; racial classification system (for whites and blacks) is a result of our history, of course. Early Latin America, with a very different history (much more racial interbreeding) had a complex system of racial designations for the numerous different percentage mixtures, and different laws were written and enforced for each.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But is he the &ldquo;666&rdquo; the religious community has been watching for?&#8221; ~~ Robert Kelly</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s a white fools choice but, the case can be better made that John McCain fits the &#8220;666&#8221; discription better.</p>
<p>From VFR:</p>
<p>Not all comebacks are nice </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a nightmare. When we remember what we went through last May and June with the Comprehensive Open Borders Act, the horror we were looking at, and how it was stopped by a tremendous wave of popular indignation, how the whole country was waking up to the amnesty and open borders agenda that the elite was trying to foist on us, and how the presidential candidacy of one of the principal villains, McCain, was justly wrecked for his having fanatically pushed this atrocity of a bill, with him being reduced from front-runner to dead in the water, and how the mass uprising against amnesty had produced new political realities. And now, after all that, this same McCain is miraculously returned from political death and is poised to clinch the Republican nomination? It&rsquo;s a nightmare. <br>
It is also unavoidably reminiscent of the story in chapter 13 of the Book of Revelation, about the beast who is given great authority by the dragon, and then receives a deadly wound, and yet (in a parody of the resurrection of Christ) recovers from his deadly wound, and all men are amazed at his power and bow down to him. Let us remember that President Clinton also received a deadly political wound, and recovered from it, and people were amazed and bowed down to him, sealing America&rsquo;s corruption. </p>
<p><br>
Revelation 13:1-4<br>
And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. </p>
<p>And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. </p>
<p>And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. </p>
<p>And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?&#8221; ~~ Lawrence Auster </p>

<p>Not for THIS WHITE MAN! I personally can&rsquo;t decide which of the three, McCain, Clinton OR OBAMA happen to be the most despicable candidates. A sentiment shared by more than a few White Voters.</p>
<p>The idiotic idea of a &#8220;dream ticket&#8221; with Hillary and Barak does have one side. That it would virtually GUARANTEE a Republican win. If Romney beats out AMNESTY McCain, then a Republican win would be infinitely better than four years (shudder) of a Clinton-Obama Administration. I can&rsquo;t believe that so many airheads would VOTE for Hillary. Haven&rsquo;t we all had more than enough of the BILLARY CLINTON White House</p>

<p>McCain who wants to revive the old southern Golden Circle idea with Mexico and central America becoming part of the United States.  This would mean every White person out of work and Latin American style corruption and dictatorship. Doesn&rsquo;t really hate Whites, just considers &#8220;White&#8221; concepts like minimum wage, decent working conditions, workmen&rsquo;s comp etc incompatible with his concept of the United States of America turned into just another poverty stricken Latin American corrupt dump.</p>
<p>Hilary, elderly communist feminazi and hater of White men. Wants to establish a commie type dictatorship, think Kruschev, Breheznik,  not Stalin.</p>
<p>Obama, puppet of George Soros, hates Whites, would do exactly what Soros wants. </p>
