<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A retired school principal is attacked by two young toughs, an awful beating captured on surveillance cameras and aired on television for days in what has become Germany&rsquo;s equivalent of the Rodney King tape.</p>
<p>But in a country that has seen all too many neo-Nazi racist attacks against immigrants over the years, this video turned ethnic violence on its head: It was a young German-born Turk and a Greek attacking a 76-year-old ethnic German who had advised them to stop smoking on the Munich subway.</p>
<p>They threw him to the ground and kicked him, cracking his skull, excoriating him all the while, calling him a &#8220;pig&#8221; and a &#8220;German&#8221; with a particularly nasty adjective attached.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, the issue of immigrant crime has become the center of elections scheduled for today here in the state of Hesse. Gov. Roland Koch, long seen as an heir apparent to Chancellor Angela Merkel, has played the anti-immigration card with vigor in his bid for reelection,  and stirred up a backlash among many voters who see uncomfortable echoes of Germany&rsquo;s Nazi past.</p>
<p>Not far into the campaign, Koch called for deporting non-Germans convicted of serious crimes, even those who may have been born in Germany. He also called for a code of public conduct that would include &#8220;German&#8221; values such as good manners, punctuality, respect for the elderly and speaking German.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That stance has bolstered Koch&rsquo;s popularity among the conservative Christian Democratic Union&rsquo;s older followers. But it has turned off many younger Germans deeply uncomfortable with the quasi-racist rhetoric, and has dragged Koch from a substantial lead to running neck-and-neck with his opponent, Andrea Ypsilanti of the left-leaning Social Democratic Party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet the topic is becoming unavoidable in cities such as Frankfurt, the financial heart of the European continent, where a stunning 66% of children younger than 5 come from an immigrant family.</p>
<p>The first waves of migrants from Italy and Turkey who came to rebuild the country after World War II were referred to as &#8220;guest workers,&#8221; and it was assumed they would one day go home. Many didn&rsquo;t, and today millions of immigrants, mainly Turks, Russians and Poles, live in Germany and have the right to apply for citizenship, but their children are not automatically entitled to it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Elderly Germans often say they are afraid to take the subway after dark, fearful of a run-in with gangs of hoodlums, sometimes German, but often Turks or other minorities.</p>
<p>Although immigrants&rsquo; share of crime is actually decreasing, it still is higher than their proportion of the population in many areas. In Hesse, about 27% of those arrested come from migrant backgrounds. But this reflects in part the fact that police often are quicker to arrest immigrant youths.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I was actually not surprised about the campaign of Koch. What has surprised me is the intensity of humiliation that is brought on those who look different,&#8221; said Fessum Ghirmazion, a 27-year old doctoral student in political science at Marburg&rsquo;s Philipps University, who sat listening quietly at a recent rally for the Social Democratic Party. &#8220;When I enter a room, people just look at me. It makes you feel like somebody who does not belong here.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A fifth of all migrant students drop out before earning their diplomas; the unemployment rate among migrants is double that of ethnic Germans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Thursday night&rsquo;s rally, more than 3,000 of Koch&rsquo;s supporters filled the square outside Frankfurt&rsquo;s ornate old opera house as a Dixieland band played the &#8220;Battle Hymn of the Republic.&#8221; There were also at least 500 protesters, most of them young ethnic Germans, carrying banners reading &#8220;Anti-Fascist Action&#8221; and shouting &#8220;Nazis out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Koch, seemingly undeterred by his plunge in the polls, stayed on message.</p>
<p>&#8220;You yelling youths without any manners, you are not the majority here!&#8221; he proclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to deal with the issues of integration and internal security, especially here in Frankfurt, where 66% of the children born have a migration background &mdash; we have to talk about that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And when we see the problem of the violence, and when we see that immigrants are perpetrators of half the crimes, then we have to discuss these problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>On stage with Koch was Merkel. The election is a litmus test for her awkward grand coalition in Berlin, which includes the Social Democrats. The chancellor opposes Turkey&rsquo;s bid to enter the European Union, and won applause at a recent party conference for saying that mosques should not be taller than churches.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have a good public transport system if people don&rsquo;t want to use it after dark,&#8221; she said at the rally. &#8220;Integration is a key issue for the future of this country. And at the same time, we have to talk about how to punish crimes like what happened in Munich.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s just show, Koch, like basically all our leadership since ww2, is of Ashkenazi descent and does not care at all! It&rsquo;s just theater to create the impression that they at least try to do something! We have a first class third world government; corrupt, incompetent, dishonest!

			<p>Any people here who think and lay back on the assumption that &#8220;Western Europe is still 95% white&#8221; (compared to the US figure of 65%) and thus reckon a higher chance for Europe to survive, I as an European can tell you: Forget it!<br>
Very soon, vast parts of Western Europe will have a percentage of non-whites that will equal US&rsquo;s number. Porous borders within the European Union, low fertility rate of native whites and in contrast a high fertility rate of muslims will make sure that countries in Western Europe will become majority non-white sooner than you think - in case the same people (self-hating liberals) will remain being in power. I know that the United States, having a border to Mexico among other things, is currently in a bad shape, but at least the birth rate among whites is not as low as in Europe. I dare to predict that if we&rsquo;re going to lose the game (on which I certainly don&rsquo;t count on), Eastern Europe and parts of Mid-West (Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, the Dakotas) will be the last reservations for whites.</p>

			<p>Muslims cannot co-exist with any other people.  Germany could absorb Russians, Italians, or others from Christendom, as they will assimilate within a generation, but one day muslims will have to be expelled or they will take over the country.</p>

			<p>For the most part, &#8220;migrant&#8221; is codeword for non-White. Also: Why won&rsquo;t Germans just go straight to the heart of the matter, and seek genetic preservation? To be honest, I don&rsquo;t want Germany to be just pure European, but also virtually pure German in important areas (other European ethnicities and Jews could make up some of the population in my opinion, although it&rsquo;s really up to the Germans), although I am not pure German. Go Germans! (Stay German, and don&rsquo;t go &#8220;Turk.&#8221;)</p>

			<p>Most white Europeans do not practice Christianity anymore. They often feel too &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; for religion. Their complacency results in Muslims dominating their countries. The Europeans&rsquo; ancestors shed so much blood to protect Europe from Muslim invasion.  It is sad to see modern Europeans so passive. Many European men would rather indulge in sex tours in Thailand than fight the liberals and invaders for their civilization and religion.</p>

			<p>Three things: the first is that migrants are heavily concentrated in the bigger cities. Not all of them are non whites. This concentration exaggerates their numbers, which is good, since it helps scare the complacent into action. </p>
<p>The second is that it is good that so few europeans are christians. All christians in Europe are heavily involved in migrant trafficking and support, physical as well as political. I dont think they will escape their just punishment once the civil wars start. </p>
<p>The third is that america is already around 50% european white by genetics. Probably 40something if you remove all those who are mixed. I am amazed at the colored americans who count themselves as white and amazed that it is accepted by other americans. <br>

<p>For whatever reason, he was not able to do so, or did not choose to do so.</p>

<p>On the one hand I agree with what you said about Christinas in Europe as far as their support of migrants. On the other hand I tend to say that the refusal of Christianity results in a very low birth rate we have in Europe right now. However, believing in Christianity does not guarantee a healthy birth rate. Poland as an example is very catholic, but is suffering from too less kids and too much emigration. Same applies to Italy and Spain.</p>

<p>&gt; Oh, you mean the bible that tells Christians to &#8220;turn the other cheek, love your enemies, and do good to those who harm you?&#8221;</p>
<p>You are referring to verses from the Old Testament, the Jewish part of the bible.  Jesus supposedly trumpted all that with his &#8220;new covenant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Actually, when it comes to actual US citizens, the percentage of whites is about 80 percent but when you count the millions of non-white non-citizens, illegals and legals alike, it drops. I don&rsquo;t have a whole lot of hope that this will change.</p>

<p><b>Were it not for the treason of indigenous leaders and their gross disregard for the physical and mental wellbeing, and safety of their own kindred peoples, their heritages, languages and cultures,</b> no unfettered masses of nonwhites hordes would be let invade white homelands as is happening at present and certainly not the ancestral ones. </p>
<p>Predominately, nonwhite immigration <b>being permitted</b> into white homelands today, is coming from territories that have seen these homelands returned during the course of the last century. Subsequently, such nonwhite invaders have no entitlement or rights in white homelands.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe this nonwhite multi-ethnic invasion assault upon the homelands of white nations, in spite of having had their nonwhite lands returned to them, shall ultimately have to be forcibly reversed regardless of the consequences. <br>

<p>While I agree with Ms. Swain, let me add furthermore that this article is about Frankfurt and Germany, which didn&rsquo;t have any non-white homelands to return. So the silly argument about the wages of colonialism, and &#8220;karma&#8221;,  used by 5:55,  is specious and irrelevant.</p>

			<p>A Swain, it is eastern bluebloods, and whites who are the traitors to their own homelands. No one else. If you would consider it carefully, it could not be anyone else, but the very power structure that allows it for their own reasons. This is true,in fact,in every Western nation. Take as an example, the Weimar Republic of Germany in the twenties. It was brought down by the very elites that thought they would use a certain loud mouthed Corporal,called the drummer among his peers, who had a considerable following. They thought they could use him to eliminate the communists in the government and when he did this eliminate him as well. The problem is he outsmarted them with the very Parlimentarian tricks they were trying to use on him. Thus,it is the elites in every society where the subversion of the society always beginns.</p>

<p>Actually, I think Deutschland will be the most powerful white country as time goes on, and the last great hope for Caucasian civilization.  They have had the better sense not to make their non-whites citizens (for the most part, and against the massive pressure from the Yankee Gov&rsquo;t and the Yankee military in Deutschland).  And it won&rsquo;t be too long before Yankee can&rsquo;t afford his empire anymore, ergo the boot will be off Deutschland&rsquo;s neck.  Most of the rest of the white world is becoming more and more non-white.</p>

<p>You are wrong, it is someone else. The white elites are an instrument, they are traitors of their own people, but they are not the cause nor the originators. You simply must read the book &#8220;The Culture of Critique&#8221; by Kevin MacDonald and all will be explained.</p>

When you think about it, considering the tremendous US debt and the plummeting value of the dollar,  it seems extremely strange that even today, 63 years after the end of the war [!], the US still maintains troops and bases inside Germany. During the Cold War, they served (presumably) to keep out any invaders.   What invasion are they staving off today?</p>
<p>In fact, and to the contrary, when Europe is presently under assault by the entire Third World,  the USA is ignoring that  invasion and is actively sponsoring the accession of Turkey into the European Union (which should be none of America&rsquo;s business), and is trying to twist Europe&rsquo;s arm to force her to accept Turkey.  The admission of Turkey to the EU will swamp Europe demographically, changing its racial and cultural character forever. Apparently, there are elements in the US who would like to see this happen!  Meanwhile, the racial invasion of Europe continues apace with Uncle Sam blindly looking the other way.  Is the American military presence there, presiding over this demographic debacle,  meant to help Europe&rsquo;s defense or to hinder it?</p>
<p>Perhaps the treatment that the US gave little Serbia provided a glimpse of where the American government&rsquo;s  sympathies lie, when it comes down to a matter of force and when sides must be taken.</p>

Bobby</p>
<p>It certainly IS someone else! Or are you immune from these problems in California?</p>

			<p>Every year, there are between 100-200 violent attacks attributed to &#8220;Neo Nazis&#8221;. In comparison, there are tens of thousands violent attacks committed by immigrants. Yet, the media only hypes on the Neo Nazi violence (of which most turn out to be fakes - Sebnitz, Potsdam, Mittweida, etc.)</p>
<p>Germans are slowly starting to fight back though: <a href="https://www.nonkonformist.net/?p=1243" rel="nofollow">https://www.nonkonformist.net/?p=1243</a></p>

			<p>These degenerate Muslims don&rsquo;t dare act that way in America because they know we are itching for an excuse to teach them a lesson.  Europeans should learn from Americans and teach those Islamic invaders some manners&hellip;</p>

			<p>Voter and Swede, so what you are really saying is whites are simply powerless people who are at the mercy of various forces, they have no control over. I see. Sounds like an easy out.</p>

No, Bobby, nothing is easy about it!  It is extremely complex. I suggest you follow Swede&rsquo;s excellent advice and do some reading.</p>
<p>PS. You should be thankful to be far away from the influence of  those evil &#8220;Eastern bluebloods&#8221;.  No wonder California is in such great shape while the rest of the country is going to the dogs. That would explain why we&rsquo;re all trying to move out there.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know browser. Is New England in such great shape? Is New Jersey? Is Chicago? About a million and a half there? How about New York? How about North Carolina, 400,000 plus illegal aliens there including gangs. I could go on, but notice one thing before you criticize California too much,(I say too much, because I get your point,) these states are thousands of miles from the southern border. You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d have an easier time of it. </p>
<p>P.S.You can&rsquo;t move out here(California),the housing prices are too steep. </p>

Bobby&#8221; you have again mis-read me!   (Evidently you don&rsquo;t get irony.) I said  &#8220;while the rest of the country is going to the dogs&#8221; [meaning everything EXCEPT California].  </p>
<p>If those &#8220;eastern bluebloods&#8221; aren&rsquo;t in control in California, well then, ask yourself, who is?  Who runs the state?  You might start by asking  either of your two California senators: Feinstein or Boxer. </p>
<p>And Bobby, there&rsquo;s a lot more afflicting this country than illegal aliens. They&rsquo;re big, but they&rsquo;re just one facet of the problem.</p>
<p>PS:  I wish Swede would return to defend his own statement.  I get so tired of other posters who wander off, and I am left to explain their comments for them.  As he said, do some reading.</p>

			<p>Browser, I have said/written before that the massive illegal alien phenomemon and all the problems it brings, is just one of the bigger symptoms and illustration, that the problems affecting this nation are completely out of control and that most Americans don&rsquo;t give a rats a  &mdash;   about it, and must therefore be honest and take responsiblility and accept the blame for it. Too many people in this nation have some kind of mental problem because we simply can&rsquo;t get our a  &mdash;  es off of both chairs. We don&rsquo;t know what we want. We don&rsquo;t care about the serious issues. We want someone else to do it for us and we are going to get exactly what we asked for because we won&rsquo;t accept the responsiblitly for our own destiny. This unconcernedness of the greater American public, manifests itself in almost every article on Mr. Taylors forum.  </p>

			<p>Browser, I forgot to add, that you are right. I did miss the irony on California. However, my contention as to who is to blame for the problems is the same, we are. I think this is the crux of the disagreement in our argument, you and Swede cite the great influence and power of other groups as the cause of our problems, and I say accept responsibility and blame those who do nothing at all about it and even facilitate it. Just to cite illegal immigration again as an example of our ignorance as Americans. If voting is real and nothing was tampered with, how can somone like &#8220;open borders,&#8221; &#8220;jobs are not returning,&#8221; &#8220;ther will be more wars&#8221;,John McCain, have possibly won in California.</p>

Does bobby think New York doesn&rsquo;t have illegal aliens?   Every international airport nowadays is in effect a border.  And they&rsquo;re pouring in as refugees, tourists (who don&rsquo;t go home, HB workers, etc, etc. Every big airport  and the area around it is just another Tijuana.</p>
<p>And what do illegal aliens have to do with Easternbluebloods?</p>

			<p>I guess we&rsquo;ve gotten somewhat away from the topic of &#8220;ethnic tensions in Germany&#8221;, although in the broader perspective we all do share the same problems of invasion, ethnic tensions, treasonous politicians, a dumbed-down media-drugged populace, etc. </p>
<p>No, Germany doesn&rsquo;t have &#8220;Eastern bluebloods&#8221; to subvert it, but it sure has the rest of the problems that we&rsquo;ve got. As for your question how McCain could possibly have won California, I am left open-mouthed and speechless after Super Tuesday. Are the American voters deaf, dumb, and blind? I don&rsquo;t know what to say, Bobby!  I readily agree with you that most of our problems are what we have allowed to happen to ourselves.</p>
<p>Now get busy as Swede said and do some reading!!!</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
Well, MY question is:  Who were those people in California doing the voting?  Were they &#8220;American&#8221; voters? </p>
<p>If not native-born Americans, it&rsquo;s understandable why they would be in favor of more immigration, more welfare, more government jobs, etc.  For them, it makes sense.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dumbfounded only because you&rsquo;re looking at as an American. But in California, Americans [real ones] are now the minority.  You&rsquo;ve got to get used to new-style politics. We all do. California is leading the way.</p>

			<p>The Jews in Germany were not a threat, the Muslims in Germans are.  Germany needs a rebirth of the fascist movement to deal with the Muslim problem.  German fascism is vastly preferable to Islamic fundamentalism and the German people will be forced to live with one or the other&hellip;</p>

			<p>Browser, you still don&rsquo;t understand the essesence of my original post. I HAVE read many of those things Swede pointed out. My point is, when do Americans take responsiblility for their own state of ignorance and apathy and start to do whatever it takes  &mdash;  form groups, organizations,etc. and in short, get down and dirty in asserting their rights in THEIR NATION  &mdash;  if they feel so alienated?</p>
