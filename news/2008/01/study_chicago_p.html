						<p>Researchers have concluded in a yet-to-be published study of the economics of prostitution in Chicago that the women claim they were forced to service police officers, worked more on holidays and varied pricing based on race.</p>
<p>University of Chicago professor and &#8220;Freakonomics&#8221; author Steven D. Levitt and sociology professor Sudhir Venkatesh of Columbia University are the authors of the two-year study of street-level prostitution in Chicago&rsquo;s Roseland, Washington Park and Pullman neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prostitutes taking part in the study &mdash; who were paid $150 a week &mdash; reported that about 3 percent of the sex acts they performed were &#8220;freebies&#8221; given to Chicago police officers to avoid arrest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study found full-time prostitutes made on average less than $20,000 a year. If they had a pimp, the women made a little more, even after giving up a 25 percent cut of their earnings. The women reported being beaten about once a month on average.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study also found white and Hispanic men were charged more, while blacks and repeat customers paid less. Seasonal spikes in demand drove up prices, bringing more women into the market. Markets in Roseland and Pullman operated differently, the study found. In Pullman, prostitutes worked with one of four pimps, while in Roseland prostitutes worked the streets on their own.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The full draft of the paper is on the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Web site, marked &#8220;extremely preliminary and incomplete.&#8221; A university spokesman said a final version of the paper is expected to be released in April.</p>

			<p>There are no surprises in the study.  Most cops are men and therefore there will be no shortage of sexual predators.  </p>
<p>Price Discrimination, where prices vary based on customer willingness to pay, explains discounts to black customers.  A group with lower income will either pay less or not rent the hooker.  Just good business sense.  They might charge younger customers less too  &mdash;   let&rsquo;s see if the study addresses that or if it just reported on race for sex appeal (pun intended).</p>

			<p>This article seems to gloss over this part to focus on the prostitution:</p>
<p><i>Prostitutes taking part in the study &mdash; who were paid $150 a week &mdash; reported that about 3 percent of the sex acts they performed were &ldquo;freebies&rdquo; given to Chicago police officers to avoid arrest.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting mostly black cops, mostly court-mandated affirmative action hires on the Chicagograd PD.  I used to have a black woman neighbor that admitted that she &#8220;put out&#8221; to a black St. Louis cop to keep from being arrested, and she also said she wanted an all-black SLPD for that reason.<br>

			<p>The study should also look into the pattern, both in the U.S. as well as Canada, of black pimps intimidating/tricking naive vulnerable white females into prostitution, using drugs and threats. The white female prostitutes become literally modern day slaves of the black male pimps. </p>

<p>Somehow I doubt a &#8220;Racial Equality in Prostitution Committee&#8221; will be established for those poor, white/Hispanic unfortunates.</p>

<p>Gee, since they are employed in a very illegal profession, you don&rsquo;t think they might be a little biased toward the police, now do you?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but I find Mr. Levitt a gross pervert. I had the displeasure of hearing him speak at a professional conference my company paid $1500 for me to attend.  I don&rsquo;t go to a computer conference to hear someone go on and on about the economics of drug dealers and prostitutes. </p>
<p>We all know these things exist, but his best selling book and the articles like this are just another part of of the &#8216;porno-ficaiton&#8221; of America. </p>
<p>Some topics are still best discussed in graduate-level academic seminars, army barracks, or not at all.  </p>

			<p>These women degrade themselves, get beaten by sleazebag pimps and risk being raped and killed by their customers, and for less than $20,000 a year?</p>
<p>They could make more money in McDonald&rsquo;s or Burger King.   </p>

			<p>Most white prostitutes come from homes where they were abused as children. In fact, most prostitutes and porn actresses suffer from BPD  &mdash;  Border Line Personality Disorder. This mental illness is, again, a product of their youthful abuse. When people claim that prostitution is a &#8220;victimless crime&#8221;, they are ignoring the studies which point to these forms of mental illness which accompany these people.</p>
<p>In other words, these women are vulnerable due to these illness&rsquo; and are being preyed upon.</p>

			<p>Anonymous at 9:59 PM Jan 14:</p>
<p>I was waiting in the lobby of a certain major hospital in St. Louis, waiting for a cab to come after a doctor&rsquo;s appointment.  Because I grew a little impatient, I went outside the lobby. </p>
<p>A few minutes later, I saw two Federal Prisons Bureau vans parking on the street-level spaces specifically reserved for law enforcement agents (this hospital&rsquo;s ER services a lot of victims of the ghetto wars, and for cops that themselves get shot therein, so cops are often involved in that hospital&rsquo;s affairs).  Eight guards got out of both vans, to transport one shackled prisoner, a relatively tall and obese black man who appeared to be in his 30s.</p>
<p>Six of the guards took him in through the hospital, while two stayed in the front lobby (there must be a security reason for that   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m guessing they want two guards familiar with him to remain at the hospital&rsquo;s main entrance in case he somehow gets out of his shackles and makes a run for it).  </p>
<p>I struck up a conversation with what looked to be the more congenial of the two guards that remained in the lobby.  He told me that the prisoner was a guest at the Federal government&rsquo;s Greenville, Illinois facility, and he was convicted of transporting minors across state lines for the explicit purpose of child prostitution.</p>
<p>A few days later, I talked to someone I know about this, and he told me the bad news that these black pimp gangs will prey on white girls of Scandinavian origin from the upper Midwest and haul them in to the black ghettos of big cities to pimp them out as prostitutes.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is definitely true.</p>

			<p>I used to be friends with a prostitute (or escort as she preferred) when I lived in a certain part of London. Once I was in her flat when she was taking calls and she said to one guy &#8220;Are you black? Your black aren&rsquo;t you? &hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry but I don&rsquo;t do black guys.&#8221; and hung up after a little excuse making. It kind of surprised me and I asked her about it. She said that the blacks were just too rough and demanding and other working girls had arrived at the same policy simply through experience. And this call-girl was mixed race which is why it surprised me.</p>

			<p>Studies like this are done to desensitize the population. Make you think it is &#8220;normal&#8221; and you are asked to be tolerant. </p>
<p>Gee, just don&rsquo;t be such a bigot. Be open minded. Be accepting, just get along.</p>
<p>It is all part of the Grand Plan for the take over.</p>

			<p>A couple of decades ago, I was a close advisor to a mayoral candidate in Memphis (who ended up finishing #2). All of the porn and peepshows in the city at the time belonged to two brothers, who were not partners. One of them came to the candidate with a video tape and $50,000. The video tape was made using a hidden camera, showing the police vice squad members raping and beating the hookers who worked for the firm. The porn operator offered the candidate $50,000 to make the video public and hopefully lead to some cleanup of the city vice police. I advised the candidate to take the money and make the video tape public. If the candidate did not want the money, it would still be good to publicize the video of the filthy and cruel cops. A week later, I was told there would be no deal, because if the candidate won the election, they would need the support of the police department. Nothing was done and the video was never released to the public. I suspect this is the same reason why abuse and crimes by police in many larger cities are not stopped or punished.</p>

<p>How times have changed. Today that video would be on YouTube in nothing flat if the candidate refused to use it.</p>
