						<p>About eight in 10 black children in Indiana are born to unwed parents &mdash; a start to life that sets them up for problems during adolescence and beyond, according to an Indiana Black Expo report.</p>
<p>Indiana&rsquo;s black youths fare significantly worse than Hoosier youths in general across 18 indicators of well-being, such as graduation rates and poverty levels, and do worse than black youths in the U.S, according to the report being released Friday.</p>
<p>Tanasha Anders, acting president and chief executive of Indiana Black Expo, said the problem comes down to education &mdash; making sure young people finish school and understand the consequences of having a baby.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The explosion of births to unwed parents is driving many of the state&rsquo;s social problems, such as increases in poverty and child abuse and the growing cost of public aid, said Bill Stanczykiewicz, president and CEO of the Indiana Youth Institute. He added that the problem is not exclusive to any one race.</p>
<p>Indiana&rsquo;s out-of-wedlock birthrate is at an all-time high, with unwed mothers accounting for nearly 40 percent of all births, he said. Nationally, about 36 percent of all births are to unwed mothers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another complicating factor is that a growing number of the single-parent births are to young adults, instead of teens, and that requires a new and different kind of message. But finding a way to address the situation is critical, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The issues that spin out of struggling single-parent families show up throughout the new Black Expo report, including the teen birth rate of 81 per 1,000 for blacks. That is almost twice the state&rsquo;s overall teen birth rate of 43.5 per 1,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To address the growing out-of-wedlock birthrates, the Black Expo report calls for increasing resources for sex education programs with proven track records and public education campaigns that promote healthy marriage.</p>
<p>Curt Smith, president of the Indiana Family Institute, which advocates for traditional families and values, blames the sexual revolution, no-fault divorce and the more recent discussions about same-sex marriage and other &#8220;marriage substitutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the battles over social values are being waged in churches and the Statehouse, Betty Cockrum, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Indiana, said young people need accurate and comprehensive education about sex and family planning.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cockrum said Indiana is struggling, at least in part, because of the state&rsquo;s strong conservative bent and a belief that information about sex should be taught by parents.</p>
<p>That philosophy shows up in state requirements for insurers: States such as California, Washington and Wisconsin require insurance companies to provide coverage for contraception; Indiana does not. And Indiana&rsquo;s Medicaid program &mdash; which pays for more than half of all births in the state &mdash; does not provide family planning services. At least 25 other states do.</p>
<p>Black Expo&rsquo;s Anders said officials hope the new report, based on data from 2004-05, will be a call to action for families, civic and faith groups, public agencies and political leaders.</p>

					<p>A few years back there was a strong rumor that a soda pop called Tropical Fantasy contained this very sort of thing and this rumor set off a panic in the ghetto. Turns out the company was black owned and it was suspected that big name brand competitors started the rumor to try and put them out of business!</p>

<p>They talk about the overwhelming problems in the black community yet always a disclaimer that &#8216;the problem is not exclusive to any one race.&rsquo; Pray, it it a big problem in asian families? I don&rsquo;t think so. Incredible.</p>

					<p>The fact is that out of wedlock births, to use a traditional term, have been averaging over 70% for blacks for years now, since the 1970&rsquo;s.  The usual suspects are government incentives, low <span class="caps">IQ, </span>social attitudes in the black community, etc.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that single &#8220;motherhood&#8221; has become the norm in the US black community.  However, there was a time, prior to the civil rights movement of the early 60&rsquo;s, when the black family structure was much more stable and rates of out of wedlock births were near the then low white norm(in the early 1950&rsquo;s).  What this implies is that there is nothing inherent about low IQ blacks which necessarily leads to this problem as black <span class="caps">IQ&rsquo;</span>s have not changed during the last 50 years. </p>
<p> Rather, blacks appear to be especially susceptible to incentives which result in family break down, crime and single parenthood.  Such susceptibility is no doubt linked to low <span class="caps">IQ, </span>poor impulse control, etc.  What is truly amazing and will be well known to anyone who knows any blacks is just how much such behavior has been transformed into the norm.  There is no longer any social stigma in the black community attached to single motherhood.  It is the new norm and the problems which it engenders will be with us for as far as one can see.</p>

					<p>This has nothing to do with social values, sex education, no-fault divorce, the sexual revolution or the availability of contraception, and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to refer to it as a &#8220;problem with the black community.&#8221; With an 80 percent illegitimacy rate, there is no &#8220;community&#8221; involved here and calling it a &#8220;problem&#8221; implies that the situation is out of the ordinary somehow. This is completely normal for blacks. White liberals can yammer all they like about &#8220;family planning,&#8221; but it won&rsquo;t change a thing.</p>

					<p>Actually it is higher, since many blacks feel common law marriage is the same as the real thing, while others  are confused what the word marriage really is/means and a few lie  about being married (being actually embarrassed about their out of wedlock children). </p>

					<p>Here&rsquo;s a scary projection: the future children of  the <span class="caps">CHILDREN </span>of these minority unwed teenage mothers, statistically speaking, are virtually preordained to &#8220;evolve&#8221; in less than a decade from now (2018 on),  within patterns of black social pathology that  are sure to be worse than even today (when statistical trends are taken into consideration). </p>
<p>&hellip;/&hellip;</p>
<p>Consider post-colonial Africa: every country there save SA  has <span class="caps">DEVOLVED </span>considerably since the continent-wide societal breakdown that commenced - uncomfortably for the cultural marxists - a mere five years after the end of European rule. </p>

					<p>This is an effect, not a cause.  Everything the report attributes to the bastardization of blacks would be there regardless.  It&rsquo;s those things that have lead to the unwed state.</p>
<p>This is extremely important to know.  You cannot fix this.  More money.  More <span class="caps">WELFARE. </span> More incentives to get and stayed married&hellip;.completely ineffective.  The root cause of the increase is simply that our socialist system allows these people to survive even though they engage in this depraved behavior.  Normally, this behavior would be a death sentence for the individual and the families.  It is counter to survival.  And we are doing something wrong by preventing these consequences.</p>
<p>We should end all welfare for blacks immediately.</p>

<p>Eight in 10 black babies are <span class="caps">NOT </span>born to unwed parents, they are born to unwed mothers. The &#8220;fathers&#8221; have moved on to other women or prison long before the babies arrive.</p>

					<p>I don&rsquo;t know why this statistic would be suprising to anyone. Illegitimate babies appear to be a cottage industry in the black culture. You see, it&rsquo;s just a matter of dollars since each kid is worth welfare handouts to the mother. Just another way they have found to milk those of us that actually contribute something meaningful to society.</p>

<p>So in other words: expecting teenagers to keep their legs shut until marriage is hopeless, and the state, not parents, knows best on teaching kids about sex.</p>
<p>Same song&hellip;millionth verse. Typical liberal nonsense at work here. The <span class="caps">REAL </span>reason Indiana is struggling is because their teenage population (I refuse to call them young adults) <strong>refuse</strong> to stop screwing like alley cats.</p>

					<p>      Daniel Patrick Moynihan, one of the great Liberals of his<br>
day, reported on the beginings of this in his report on breakdown<br><br>
of the Black family. In it, he correctly pointed to welfare as<br><br>
the cause. A woman can make more alone with a baby than she <br><br>
could with the typical Black husband. Shortly after this report,<br><br>
the Marxists strengthened their hold and it became impossible to<br><br>
talk straight about this. Any politician who said what he said<br><br>
now would be drummed out of public life. Cant reigns supreme and<br><br>
our leaders rave and wax eloquent about things they don&rsquo;t be-<br><br>
lieve. Honorable men would not do so. As the Chinese classics<br><br>
teach, honorable men retire from public life rather than live a<br><br>
life of falsehood and thievery. With one or two exceptions, none<br><br>
of them will be allowe public office after the Fall.</p>

<p>Does Africa have a strong conservative bent too?  Look at blacks anywhere in the world, and you&rsquo;ll see they breed and procreate like mad, completely out of wedlock.  Their males impregnate the females and then conveniently exit to repeat the process with another female someplace else.  Black females are only partially able to care for their offspring and many die from neglect unless whites are there to pick up the slack.  It&rsquo;s always been this way with blacks since the dawn of time   &mdash;   in Indiana or not.</p>

					<p>This is the result of the village raising kids, per <span class="caps">HRC&rsquo;</span>s &#8220;It Takes a Village&#8221;, in the black community it is the village idiot, and they impregnate them, and our goverment rewards them with welfare and social services from the craddle to the grave.</p>

					<p>The point here I think is that blacks in general don&rsquo;t have any plan of living. They just go along in life being blown here and there with little consciousness. Every minute of the day is as if they just opened their eyes from a deep sleep and are bewildered at finding themselves wherever they happen to be.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t always this bad. There was a time when they weren&rsquo;t like this. However, it&rsquo;s now clear those years that they were near normal were an aberation and that the way they are now is their natural state.</p>
<p>At one time they did have a wonderful leader in Booker T. Washington. A fine man. Too bad that they finally rejected his precepts, or more likely, were unable to measure up. I definitely believe that if they had been able to follow his concept of living, we wouldn&rsquo;t be going through what we are today. As things stand now, unfortunately, blacks are going to have to be dealt with harshly. Too bad, but they brought this state of affairs on themselves.</p>

					<p>Come on man. Marriage is a white system. Anything white gotta go and you know that. White is a non-color. White ropes for nooses, white crosses for burning, white robes, white knights, white snow, white Christmas espec those who dream of it, white Jesus, white crackers, white rice, white rule, white White House, white America, white world. All thats gotta change to non-white using whitey female as a tool to get impregnated and get those good genes but the offspring still be 100% black or African American labeled. <br>
Never mention the fact that Obama poster child had a white mother and thats why he appears intelligent and not ebonic like Jesse or Al. </p>

					<p>As an Englishman, I had to &#8216;google&rsquo; <span class="caps">HOOSIER </span>for a definition of the word. This research was a hoot and far more entertaining than reading about the breeding habits of black africans, of which much has already been written on <span class="caps">AMREN </span>and elsewhere and will no doubt be writ in times to come. I see that the zimbabwe inflation rate has now reached 100,000 percent and that presidential elections are called for in March 2008. Well, that should solve everything over there in black africa and perhaps black africans living in White countries such as <span class="caps">UK, USA, NZ,</span> Canada, Australia etc etc et al should stop bitching, whining, complaining and generally being a complete pain in the arse and thank us for funding these &#8216;welfare&rsquo; scams, as scams they surely are. Breed and collect benefit. What a load of utter tosh!  </p>

That method seems to be working well and the ironic part is we are unwillingly complicit in our own destruction because we are forced to subsidize their unfettered copulation.

					<p>I wonder? It&rsquo;s been demonstrated that young Black males have 3-19 times more testosterone level than their White counterparts. And White males have about 20+ times more T-level than White females. So how much T-Level do Black females have? The obsolete T-levels of male Blacks has contributed to the most dangerous of them being incarcerated, etc. My guess is that Black females might have near levels of the T-level of White males? If so, combined with their overall low <span class="caps">IQ, </span>a plausible theory could made to explain their propensity to gangs, unwed motherhood, and so forth?</p>

					<p>  I thought americas first black president Bill Clinton signed a bill limiting welfare to 5 years. Guess like all laws that only applys to white people. Bill cosby told the blacks to straighten up.Oprah made her money in America but decided to build a school in Africa. Bill gates made his fortune in America but goes to other countries to give it away, except for the minority schloraships. It looks like everybody has given up on this country. For good reason. All thats really left is the fight over what to name it. United states of Atzlan, United states of Afmerica, or United states of Asia.</p>

					<p>Anonymous posters at 11:28 am and 11:57 am both asked about the supposed &#8220;Welfare Reform&#8221; enacted in 1996.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually news about that today.</p>
<p>The 1996 Welfare Reform Act has turned out to be an abject failure.  Between the time when its provisions took effect and 9/11, <span class="caps">SSI </span>was the fastest-growing line item in the Federal budget.  What this meant is that former <span class="caps">AFDC </span>recipients who would have received <span class="caps">TANF </span>switched over to <span class="caps">SSI, </span>based on the presumption (and probably the reality) that they and/or their children were crazy or retarded.</p>
<p>Now, for the relatively few <span class="caps">TANF </span>recipients left, one of its &ldquo;reforms&rdquo; has been weakened.</p>
<p>The Federal bureaucrats that run <span class="caps">TANF, </span>at the behest of most state governors, and under opposition of the Bush Administration,  will now allow a year&rsquo;s worth of college attendance to count toward <span class="caps">TANF&rsquo;</span>s &#8220;work requirement,&#8221; and furthermore, there will be no more homework monitoring.</p>
<p>What will probably happen is that many <span class="caps">TANF </span>recipients will appear to register for classes at a junior college or technical school.  Based on the fact that they have low incomes, Federal grants will pay the tuition.  However, they won&rsquo;t actually attend the classes, and since there&rsquo;s no homework check anymore, they have no incentive to do so.</p>
<p>So combine that with the increased recipient rolls of <span class="caps">SSI, </span>and the 1996 Welfare Reform did nothing.  In fact, the Federal government would probably be spending less without it.</p>

					<p>Indiana IS a wonderfully conservative state.  Folks I&rsquo;ve known from there are down-to-Earth, respectful, and industrious.  </p>
<p>If you could take half of Indy and stick it in Alabama and then drop Gary into Lake Michigan, Indiana would be a great place.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, if births to single African women are 8 of 10 in Indianapolis, what must they be in Gary?  </p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know about the Hoosier state&rsquo;s northwestern corner, Gary makes Camden, East St. Louis, and Compton look like garden spots.  Sometimes I think that Gary is a &#8220;work&#8221; in progress in its drive to outdo Detroit.  Like its aforementioned &#8220;sista&#8221; cities, Gary was a productive, civilized place to live and work just 45 years ago.  <span class="caps">RIP.  </span></p>

<p>You mean 3-19% not 3-19 times! 3-19 times normal levels are what you find in bodybuilders, with some hardcore idiots going above 30x normal levels. If you are interested, I suggest you procure a 5mg tablet of dianabol (around $0.20 or so) at your local black market dealer. Consumption of this will give you a day dose of testosterone which will rapidly disseminate troughout your body, temporarily giving you a testosterone level thats 5 times greater than normal. You will not rage nor have a constant boner. The source of black behaviour is not in their testosterone levels but in their brain structure, which is different from european or asian brain layouts. If it was just in their testosterone levels, it would be trivial to fix them, there are testosterone release inhibiting medicines available. I would say that the minimum fix includes a cybernetic axuillary brain, which is beyond current technology. </p>

					<p><i>They gotta get that check. They think of their babies as dolls. They dress their toddlers in expensive, hip baby clothes. They don&rsquo;t think about next week.</i></p>
<p><i>Posted by GAonMYmind at 7:54 PM on January 25 </i></p>
<p>There was a rundown mall I used to pass through occasionally in an &#8220;urban&#8221; area.  On the first floor, by the city bus depot, there was a store that exclusively sold overpriced hip-hop baby clothes and giant fake-gold earrings and necklaces.  I used to call it &#8220;the baby mama store&#8221;, and it was always good for a laugh!  </p>
<p>It was owned and run by Pakistani immigrants - I guess they looked around the neighborhood and saw what would sell.  I wonder if the blacks who shopped there realized how foolish they looked to those store owners?  Teenage dropout LaKisha spent her check on enormous trashy earrings and tracksuits for her illegitimate baby, while immigrants who showed up from 3rd world seeking opportunity made their fortunes off her ghetto spending habits.  Talk about laughing all the way to the bank - no one &#8220;disrespects&#8221; ghetto blacks like hardworking immigrants.  </p>
<p>Although I hate to see all the 3rd world immigration flowing into this country, I do enjoy watching blacks get shown up over and over by everyone who gets off the boat!  And yet they still blame whitey with a straight face.</p>

<p>Good catch!!  They wouldn&rsquo;t dare show it.  It would be <span class="caps">WAY </span>too embarrassing.  They list the black illegitimacy rate and compare it to the black/hispanic/white/etc <i><b>combined</b></i> rate.  </p>
<p><i>Actually it is higher, since many blacks feel common law marriage is the same as the real thing, while others are confused what the word marriage really is/means and a few lie about being married (being actually embarrassed about their out of wedlock children).</i></p>

<p>Hispanics often do this too - they call their longtime live-in boyfriend their &#8220;husband&#8221;.  Most ghetto &#8220;fiance&#8221; relationships have no weddings plans in sight and neither party&rsquo;s family pushes the issue; I guess that&rsquo;s a common-law way of &#8220;going steady&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Have you noticed that when some black thug gets killed the media sometimes interviews &#8220;his fiance&#8221; but <i><span class="caps">NEVER</span></i> &#8220;his wife&#8221;?  Even mainstream media reporters would probably not report that someone was married when they clearly weren&rsquo;t, but are fine with letting the old &#8220;fiance&#8221; slide.  Funny how black thugs always get killed <i>right before</i> they were about to marry their baby mama.  </p>
<p>I know very few young black women who have gotten married <span class="caps">BEFORE </span>having a baby.  Although the national black illegitimacy rate is officially 68.8%, I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s at least 85% if you fact-checked using marriage records.  </p>
<p>In fact, the only young black mothers I have met who were married before getting pregnant with their first child were Carribean or African immigrants.  </p>

<p>I understand that testosterone released only at critical periods such as during the fetal or adolescent stages makes all the difference to later behavior, otherwise as you state there&rsquo;s not the effect.

<p> Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that even in the ghetto there is money to be made and business opportunities. Even here though blacks fail to achieve. I recall watching some part of a Spike Lee movie once (I forget the name). There was a scene where some Korean immigrants are in a run-down black neighbourhood and are looking at some corner real estate. Anyways a group of black men are standing around sullenly and making derogatory comments about them &#8220;those Koreans will probably be running the place and owning the stores there in a few years&#8221; etc. They are rueing the predicted future success of the Asians. I kept thinking to myself, well you idiots why not beat them to the punch? You guys were born in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>speak English and have the home team advantage. Why not open the stores yourselves? Why let Koreans benefit from the economic activity of your own community? But the blacks just kept standing there. Talking, but doing nothing. Nothing points to the pathology of black failure like the success of other non-White groups. When blacks can&rsquo;t even be successful business people serving other blacks in their own black areas that is really saying a lot.</p>

<p></p>
<p>For the first time in 35 years, the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>fertility rate has climbed high enough to sustain a stable population, solidifying the nation&rsquo;s unique status among industrialized countries.</p>
<p>The overall fertility rate increased 2 percent between 2005 and 2006, nudging the average number of babies being born to each woman to 2.1, according to the latest federal statistics. That marks the first time since 1971 that the rate has reached a crucial benchmark of population growth: the ability of each generation to replace itself.</p>

<p>Perhaps what it is saying the most is that we really should consider cutting off welfare to blacks.  The money to spend in the Korean grocery did not come to the blacks working a job and earning a paycheck.  There is a word for this situation&hellip;.socialism.  Every single time socialism has become the economic system, the nation that used it, collapsed.  The US is not immune to this.  Also, democracy and capitalism are the rule of law here, not socialism.  We need to reign this problem in.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;d heard about the black-induced collapse of Gary, Ind.; now others here have confirmed it. A real-life <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_Man#Background_and_productions" rel="nofollow">Prof. Harold Hill would be turning in his grave. No doubt the blacks would long ago have burned the &#8220;Gary Conservatory&#8221; to the ground.</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which is more bizarre: a) a sociopathic race with a 70% (or higher) illegitimacy rate having the gall to demand inclusion into polite society, or b) polite society being so stupid and/or spineless as to cave in to that demand.</p>

Previous poster said: </p>
<p>&#8220;a Spike Lee movie once (I forget the name). There was a scene where some Korean immigrants are in a run-down black neighbourhood and are looking at some corner real estate. Anyways a group of black men are standing around sullenly and making derogatory comments about them &ldquo;those Koreans will probably be running the place and owning the stores there in a few years&rdquo; etc.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The movie is &#8220;Do the Right Thing&#8221; (1989). To be fair, one of the black men in that discussion does ask: &#8220;Well how come we blacks don&rsquo;t do this ourselves, open our own stores? What&rsquo;s wrong with us?&#8221; </p>
<p>If I recall, none of them really has an answer for that. So the question is left unresolved, and they go back to playing dominoes. <br>

					<p>The only way to reduce the illegitimacy rate is to drastically cut the welfare state. The problem is far too many white liberals would cry &#8220;cutting welfare is cruel to the children&#8221;. Actually black boys born to unwed mothers are statistically so likely to become criminals that we should have tiny handcuffs ready for them from the second they are born. I would also tie the tubes of any single mother who even applies for welfare. </p>
<p>My ideas might seem extreme to some. But doing nothing will just give us more of the same.</p>

Actually it is higher, since many blacks feel common law marriage is the same as the real thing, while others are confused what the word marriage really is/means and a few lie about being married (being actually embarrassed about their out of wedlock children). </p>
<p><br>
Marriage may provide a stable structure for some people, but it is unnecessary for others. Marriage is not a requirement for functional families.</p>

One poster made the point - &#8220;Bill Cosby must be shocked and saddened at how dismally the three generations of blacks following his time in the sun have turned out.&#8221;<br><br>
I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of you, but when I was a kid, Cos was very popular, and his success came through a lot of hard work in college academics, sports, and entertainment . This was the choice he made; unfortunately, not too many blacks seem to makepositive life choices. <br><br>
I still remember many of his stories, and a recurring theme is the fact that he obviously had a <span class="caps">DAD </span>around that cared enough to stay around and straightened him and his brother out when needed. <br><br>
This is obviously what is missing in black society; any sort of positive role models. </p>

					<p>Blacks are a failed race.  They know that their only hope for survival comes from grafting themselves (socially, economically and genetically) to the white race, which is why they constantly bleat &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221;, while moving constantly closer and closer to whites, in every conceivable way, no matter how far away whites try to move, and no matter how impotently &#8220;racist&#8221; whites manage to be.</p>
<p>If whites were truly so evil and racist, blacks would be running <span class="caps">THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, </span>as hard and as fast as they possibly can.  Instead they keep lobbying, in every conceivable way, for more handouts from, and integration and race mixing with, white people.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they know that, without it, their race is destined for the ash heap of history, and they would prefer to drag us down into the jungles with them, rather than just admit defeat and bow gracefully out of the evolutionary race.</p>
<p>At this time, the subconscious, animalistic survival instinct of the black race is much stronger than their social conformity instinct, and now that the pressure from &#8220;racist&#8221; white america for the latter has been neutered, we see the former in all it&rsquo;s grasping, bug-eyed, bare-fanged, detrousered ignominy.</p>
<p>Until the noble, upward advancement instinct of the white race overpowers the animalistic survival instinct of the non-whites and their false white guilt trip weapon, the white race will continue to be dragged down into an evolutionary, economic and technological quagmire.</p>

					<p> Blacks have never had the internal compass or ability to defer gratification that whites do: nevertheless, blacks were doing a lot better 50 years ago than today. Their trends were improving then, whereas today they are getting worse.</p>
<p> Blacks need discipline and structure, when that is provided, they can live decent lives for the most part. They are only weakly capable if at all of providing this structure for themselves.<br>

I well remember that, having seen it.  Many of them were undiciplined, unpunctual, quarrelsome, couldn&rsquo;t take orders, had no work ethic, thought they could do whatever they pleased, didn&rsquo;t respect rules, and did very little work.  What little work they did do, was often so terrible, it had to be done over -  by somebody else.</p>
<p>Therefore, puttling them &#8220;to work&#8221; was only an illusion, because a lot of them proved to be useless. They were a drag on the organization, and they knew they couldn&rsquo;t be fired.</p>

<p>I think there is no doubt that the &#8220;Sexual Revolution&#8221; (which has been promoted by the <span class="caps">MSM </span>and entertainment industry) has hit the black community harder than it has the white community.  The reason is simple: blacks are much more gullible and susceptible to indoctrination than whites.  This is why almost every commercial you see today has a &#8220;hip hop&#8221; theme and is directed towards blacks.  It is not that these companies are trying to alienate white comsumers or think that blacks make up the majority of the purchasers of their products, rather they recognize that these ads will have a marginal effect on white consumers and have a huge impact on getting black consumers to buy their products.  For these same reasons, blacks seem to have a hard time differentiating between pretend and reality.  They simply mimick what they see on t.v. and this includes the Sexual Revolution.  <br>

					<p>I think illegitimacy rates have more to do with the behavior of men than with the behavior of women.  As many posters have pointed out, many of the babies born to unwed white mothers probably have black fathers.  Let&rsquo;s be honest, premarital sex is the norm amongst both blacks and whites and accidents do happen.  The difference is, when a black man gets a woman pregnant, his first impulse is to run.  When a white man gets a woman pregnant, his first impulse is to start a family.  This is not to say that all black men do the wrong thing or that all white men do the right thing.  This is simply what I have observed in my life.  Many of my friends and family members have gotten girls pregnant and all of them married these girls either before or shortly after they had the baby.  On the other hand, virtually every black man I have ever worked with had multiple children with multiple women and thought nothing of.  It seems that black men view their children as conquests or burdens whereas white men view their children as a part of themselves that they have a duty to take care of.  </p>

<p>This exemplified the central error in your post. Blacks are several times likelier to be on welfare than whites. The white illegitimacy rate is about 25%, the black rate hovers around 70%. Blacks commit violent crimes at ten times the white rate. Control for economics, and blacks are still far more violent and welfare-dependent than whites. Race correlates with social pathologies much more strongly than does any economic factor. Before hauling out tired, ad hominem acccusations of &#8220;ignorance&#8221; you&rsquo;d be well advised to master a few basics of statistics.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Tanasha Anders, acting president and chief executive of Indiana Black Expo, said the problem comes down to education &mdash; making sure young people finish school and understand the consequences of having a baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the way Mexican illegals have driven down semiskilled and entry level wages, often the best way for a girl to earn a living is to have a couple kids where she can get on welfare.</p>
<p>Welfare reform means that after five years of county welfare she will have to do a lot of Dr. shopping and hire one of those taxpayer paid <span class="caps">SSI </span>attorneys to get herself and the kids on <span class="caps">SSI </span>which goes on forever. The food stamps, section 8 and free medicalcare aren&rsquo;t cut off after five years, only the <span class="caps">TANF </span>cash payment.</p>
<p>Another benefit of life long welfare and <span class="caps">SSI </span>is that one is never laid off, never outsourced and your job is not given to illegal Mexicans.  The combined <span class="caps">SSI </span>and other benefits adds up to an earned income of about $25,000 per year, which is more than most of these girls will be able to earn.</p>
<p>The real way to get Americans off welfare is to send all the illegals home and stop bringing legal immigrants.  This will cause upward pressure on wages and low skilled Americans will be able to support themselves and their kids.</p>

<p>Calvin Murphy of the Houston Rockets earned millions of dollars playing basketball. During his long career, he fathered a total of 13 children by nine different women. How does welfare explain that?<br>
Murphy went to Niagara University, so you can&rsquo;t say it was a lack of education.</p>
