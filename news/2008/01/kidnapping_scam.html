						<p>A chilling voice mail came over Delfino Ramirez Diaz&rsquo;s cell phone: His pregnant and sobbing girlfriend told Ramirez she&rsquo;d been snatched by kidnappers and only a ransom of $10,000 would stop them from inducing labor and selling their twins on the black market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me, my love! Help me!&#8221; Maria Isabel Puente said in Spanish. &#8220;They said they are going to give me an herb to remove my babies,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I love you so much. Whatever happens, I love you so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incident, which police said played out quietly in Houston last week, turned out to be a scam.</p>
<p>Kidnapping scams, such as people staging their own abductions, are common in Mexico, the birthplace of both Ramirez and Puente. But authorities said they now appear to be popping up in Houston, with three in the past few months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police say Puente, 38, had conned Ramirez into believing she was pregnant. Officers arrested her on a felony theft charge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Targeting immigrants</b></p>
<p>Immigrants are falling victim to the old crime with a new lease on life, and police are spending numerous hours scrambling to save a supposed victim, said Lt. Murray Smith of the homicide division, which handles approximately six legitimate kidnappings a year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Retired FBI agent Raul Salinas, who taught anti-kidnapping courses to Mexican police and is now mayor of the border city of Laredo, said kidnapping scams are so common in Mexico that there is a term for them &mdash; <i>autosecuestro</i> &mdash; which basically translates as &#8220;self-kidnapping.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I read a story in a travel magazine about a very  wealthy expatraite who was living in Mexico and befriended a local he saw every morning  at the store. After about three months of  conversation and kindnesses shown to him by his wealthy friend the  man  wanted to return the favor. <br>
 He asked the ex-pat if he would like it if he were to  meet him at the  Americans  apartment and  then spend a whole day showing  him the  art galleries, churches and ruins etc. The American loved the idea. What kind of price can you put on that kind of  local &#8220;expertise&#8221;.  <br>
  The morning went great but by afternoon something had come up. His friend seemed to  become more and more agitated and/or preoccupied and  spent every five minutes on his cell phone. Finally they parted ways at the coffee shop they both frequented.  After the American wallked the short distance to his apartment, he found nothing there, not even socks or toilet paper.  Price tag on lesson learned, $250,000 U.S. Dollars </p>

			<p>This is just one story in the larger story of the Mexican migration into the United States. What we&rsquo;re seeing isn&rsquo;t an invasion. It&rsquo;s a migration, similar in many ways to the migration of the Germanic tribes into Roman Gaul which eventually led to the collapse of the Western Empire. The comparison isn&rsquo;t exact, though. The Romans fought pitched battles to keep the Germans on their side of the Danube. At other times, they invited the barbarians into their provinces, hoping to use them to cultivate unpopulated land and fill the ranks of their armies. Our government is only waging a virtual war against the migration  &mdash;  a simulation designed to keep the population sedated  &mdash;  but, like the Romans, our traitorous &#8220;leaders&#8221; and corporations see the Mexicans as a source of cheap labor and cannon fodder for the military. </p>
<p>A Visigoth working a farm in Gaul or serving as a Roman auxiliary was a net benefit until he decided to join his brothers and march on Rome, but our Mexican migrants only serve to depress wages and drive Americans out of jobs, and there&rsquo;s no reason for them to burn Washington to the ground. They&rsquo;ll take over through sheer numbers. But the real problem isn&rsquo;t economic or political. It&rsquo;s racial and cultural. Oswald Spengler considered the Mexican (Aztec-Mayan) civilization as one of the eight High Cultures of the world, but they&rsquo;ve long since collapsed, returning to &#8220;mere zoology&#8221; to use Spengler&rsquo;s term. Nowadays, we&rsquo;re more polite. We call Mexico a Third World nation. If one Mexican comes to the United States, he can find work and assimilate, more or less, into the dominant culture, but if thirty million Mexicans move here, what we have is a de facto extension of Mexico&rsquo;s borders  &mdash;  an extension of the Third World into American territory.</p>
<p>This is an unmistakable sign that the United States is collapsing. In fact, I believe that the United States as a nation with a unifying culture  &mdash;  the American Republic  &mdash;  has already collapsed. It started back in the Sixties, though its roots can probably be traced back to the War Between The States. We&rsquo;ve been living through the collapse for the last fifty years, but it has happened so gradually in terms of a single human lifespan that we barely noticed until the symptoms became so glaring that they couldn&rsquo;t be ignored any more. In reality, the collapse has happened very rapidly in historical terms. In my opinion, history will show that the American experiment lasted for approximately 200 years at the most. The Seleucid Empire lasted longer than that and how many people even know what it was anymore? The final stages of the collapse probably won&rsquo;t be very dramatic. The country could break up into separate regions. Most likely, it will drag on for hundreds of years, maintaining the form of its present institutions, gradually losing its economic and military influence, a diverse, crime-riddled surveillance society ruled by the likes of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and George Bush.</p>

			<p>Spengler is 100% correct and I have been predicting for some time just the outcome he has outlined. I have only differed in the time frame, I believe that our children and certainly our grandchildren will live to see the break-up of the United States into a number of smaller seperate nations based on ethnicity and language. The elites in Washington don&rsquo;t have a clue and believe they can hold things together by force. However, when the break-up comes it is going to happen so quickly that there will be no putting the genie back in the bottle.</p>
<p>If you want an example of what I am talking about, you simply have to look at Yugoslavia. What used to be Yugoslavia is now been broken up into several smaller entities. Interestingly enough one of them, Kosovo, is a Muslim nation.</p>

			<p>Fascinating post by Spengler.  I agree with Spengler overall, but I believe that the US hasn&rsquo;t collapsed yet, but it will.  I also believe that the collapse will be swift and violent, and a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; of external and internal problems explode all at once.   </p>

			<p>Sounds like a typical story to me.  As the United States embraces Third Worlddom, expect this to be just part of business as usual.  If I had a dime for every time someone tried to scam me in Latin America..</p>

			<p>If Mexicans would only put all that effort and creativity in legal pursuits instead of  scams and drug trafficking. </p>

			<p>Kidnapping is the number one cottage industry in Mexico.  I remember reading decades ago that Mexicans were complaining that &ldquo;traditionally it has always been the wealthy that are kidnapped, but now criminals are also kidnapping those who are merely well off&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
