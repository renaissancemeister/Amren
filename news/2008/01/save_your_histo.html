						<p>Evelyn Johnson&rsquo;s father has never liked talking about his time in the Army during World War II. He was angry that black servicemen like him fought for freedom overseas only to come home to face discrimination, she says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Saturday, Johnson learned how to best preserve the box full of letters &mdash; written in pencil, still folded in their original envelopes &mdash; at an event organized by the Smithsonian&rsquo;s National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p>
<p>Held in collaboration with the Chicago Public Library, the daylong event featured classes where attendees could learn how to safely handle and preserve photos, clothing, textiles, collectibles, books and paper items.</p>
<p>The program was the first in a Smithsonian series called &#8220;Save Our African American Treasures.&#8221; Similar events are planned for Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York City and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Attendees also were able to meet one-on-one with conservation experts, similar to the PBS show &#8220;Antiques Roadshow.&#8221; However, the emphasis was not on financial worth, but cultural and historical significance.</p>
<p>Wearing cotton gloves, the conservation experts dispensed advice on preserving more than 100 items.</p>
<p>Some of the items included a cap worn by a sleeping-car porter working for the Pullman Co. and a gold-colored pin given to a top saleswoman by Madam C.J. Walker, a black entrepreneur who built a fortune by developing and marketing hair care and beauty products to African-American women in the early 1900s.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lonnie Bunch III, the museum&rsquo;s founding director, said he came up with the idea for the event while thinking about how the museum will build its collection. The museum, created by an act of Congress in 2003, is to be built on a site on the National Mall in Washington, with construction expected to be completed in 2015.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bunch said some items examined during the &#8220;African American Treasures&#8221; events might eventually get into the museum&rsquo;s collection. He would particularly love to find a uniform worn by a soldier during the early period of World War I, or signage related to segregation.</p>
<p>But he also wants people with historical items &mdash; if no one in the family is interested in caring for them &mdash; to consider donating them to local libraries, museums and institutions where they could become part of a research collection.</p>

					<p>Instead of wasting millions of dollars in taxpayer money to construct this museum on the National Mall, we could offer narrated bus tours thru the city of Detroit. </p>
<p>There, comfortably seated behind bullet proof glass, with a police escort in tow, we could all marvel at the rich history and wonderful culture of African Americans.</p>

					<p>I live in Northern Virginia and go to the Smithsonian frequently.  The National Gallery of Art and the Air &amp; Space Museums are basically White History &amp; Culture celebrations in my eyes.  The Black Pandering Museum will look pretty poor in comparison!  It can&rsquo;t be worse than the Native American Museum, though - other than a fantastic cafeteria, the Indians screwed up royally with that convoluted waste of space.   </p>
<p>The year the black museum opens will be a <span class="caps">GREAT </span>year to visit the Natural History Museum at the Smithsonian, which is usually overrun with public school &#8220;students&#8221; on field trips.  All the obnoxious DC school kids will be bussed over to the Black museum instead, and the rest of us can <i><b>finally</b></i> look at dinosaur bones in peace.  </p>
<p>In fact, I plan to spend Martin Luther King Day 2015 (the symbolic D-Day of the new Black Pandering Museum) at the Smithsonian&rsquo;s Air &amp; Space Museum.  There is <i><b>NO <span class="caps">CHANCE</span></b></i> there will be any &#8220;urban students&#8221; at looking at pictures of white astronauts that day!  </p>

<p>Funny, neither did my grandfather, and it wasn&rsquo;t because he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to eat with certain people who did not want him near them in the first place.</p>

					<p>Sigh&hellip;another case of white pandering. </p>
<p>Now I know some may argue, &#8220;Oh let them have their fun&hellip;what harm does it do? Where is your generosity of spirit?&#8221; Well there are four reasons this is offensive to whites, or at least should be:</p>
<p>1. It will be primarily funded by white taxpayers.</p>
<p>2. It will be another monument to white guilt (little or no mention of black slaveholders, and certainly no mention of the fact that blacks sold fellow Africans into slavery in the first place). Every exhibit will have something about how blacks were oppressed here there or somewhere else.</p>
<p>3. It will deliberately perpetuate falsehoods, like the traffic light was invented by a black man, etc. If we are concerned about educating our young people, then the perpetuation of deliberate falsehoods is certainly something to be angry about.</p>
<p>4. Where is the white history museum? Before anyone argues that &#8220;all the other museums in Washington are white history museums,&#8221; that is the biggest insult to blacks of all. Although there is some truth to that argument, we&rsquo;re certainly not allowed to call them that.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m wondering how that will work out.  They tried to get an African-American museum started around here, and there was always the problem of lack of funds, funds disappearing, constant in-fighting as to who was in charge, etc.<br>
I haven&rsquo;t heard about any progess (or lack thereof) in a long time.</p>

					<p>Let&rsquo;s see. They want us to do away with stereotype representations of blacks but they&rsquo;re going to amass a museum full of &#8216;racist&rsquo; iconography.</p>
<p>Will it be a celebration of black heritage or a condemnation? I can see both extremes of the black community fighting over what the exhibits should be, how they&rsquo;re to be presented, and how they should be interpreted. This will be the razors edge of political correctness infighting.<br>

					<p>Hey St. Louis CofCC Blogmeister, white people have a lot more saved history than black people. Have you ever been to the Smithsonian? I have my race&rsquo;s (white) history in the US saved so why can&rsquo;t black people?</p>

					<p>  Somehow, I have the feeling that white diversity liberals will be the main patrons of Smithsonian&rsquo;s National Museum of African American History and Culture. Of course, mixed public school student groups will file through the museum for &#8220;enrichment.&#8221; I doubt the black masses will ever come, except for a few well educated black people  &mdash;  W.E.Dubois&rsquo; &#8220;talented tenth.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;I have my race&rsquo;s (white) history in the US saved so why can&rsquo;t black people?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because it would be the very definition of Racism.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is blacks are already overrepresented, not in our history museums, but in museums such as the Inventers Hall of Fame in Akron, <span class="caps">OH.</span> Do you believe they aren&rsquo;t? I have no problems with this at all, personally. I do, personally, have a problem with &#8216;museums&rsquo; pushing a black-achievement/white-guilt agenda. That would be another example of blatant racism. Perhaps you should catalog that </p>

					<p>My uncle was at the Battle of the Bulge and black truck drivers had to be threatened with death to drive into the danger areas, either die here by us or dodge the Germans.</p>
<p>It works both ways, he never talked much about the War, just  a few isolated incidents detailed, but he did avoid blacks his entire life.  </p>
<p>He loathed blacks more than the Germans and the battle where he left a leg.</p>

					<p>The true legacy of black soldiers during <span class="caps">WWII</span>: Interestingly, even though there were relatively few black soldiers, with almost all of them serving in non-combat roles, the vast majority of claims of rape, murder, etc. made by civilians during the American occupation of Europe were against black soldiers.</p>

					<p>This and all museums should be built and supported by private investment and admission fees, not taxes or any other funds extracted without the consent of the extractee.  That would take care of this nonsense. I don&rsquo;t think the average black would pay to see a porter&rsquo;s cap any more than I would. </p>
