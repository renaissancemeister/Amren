						<p>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) &mdash; Denmark&rsquo;s National Library said Wednesday it plans to archive the original Prophet Muhammad caricatures that sparked violent protests across the Islamic world two years ago.</p>
<p>Despite objections from some Muslim leaders, the library in the Danish capital will preserve the 12 cartoons for research purposes but will not make them available to the public for at least 10 years, spokeswoman Jytte Pedersen said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 12 cartoons first were published by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten on Sept. 30, 2005, and then reprinted by a number of Western newspapers early the following year. Mass protests erupted in Muslim countries where the cartoons widely were seen as insulting. One showed Muhammad wearing a turban shaped as a bomb with a lit fuse.</p>
<p>The Copenhagen-based Islamic Faith Community, a network of Muslim groups that spearheaded protests against the cartoons in Denmark, said archiving the original drawings was a bad idea.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Danish imam Abdul Wahid Pedersen disagreed, saying it was important to preserve the cartoons as part of the historical record of &#8220;a very important event that turned the world upside down.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eleven of the drawings remain in the hands of the cartoonists, while one was sold to a private buyer, said Claus Seidel of Denmark&rsquo;s cartoonists&rsquo; association.</p>
<p>The library spokeswoman said she believed the artists would agree to donate the cartoons to the archives.</p>

			<p>Why not just plaster them across the cities and deport any &#8220;Muslims&#8221; that riot, assault native Danes, burn churches etc?</p>
<p>It would certainly go a long way in &#8220;easing ethnic tensions&#8221;.</p>

<p>And, ten years hence, when Denmark is so heavily Muslim that it changes its name to Danmarkistan, Sharia Law will have the cartoons destroyed and its cartoonists beheaded.</p>
<p>However, I have them stored (my server is down at the time of this writing):</p>

			<p>Anything to do with them doesn&rsquo;t affect anything one iota.</p>
<p>All we have to do to see them is pull them up on one of our files.</p>
<p>What that silly little government does makes zero difference to anybody really.</p>

			<p>Have the people running Denmark&rsquo;s National Library not heard of the Internet? Where nothing ever dies? What a bunch of fools!</p>

			<p>The cartoons that really whipped up the violent frenzy in the Muslim world WERE NOT THESE! They were instead some inflammatory PHONIED UP ones created by the Eurpean-based Muslim Imans THEMSELVES who went on a tour of the Muslim world to whip up hysteria. But the supposedly &#8220;professional&#8221; journalists manage to leave that little fact out of their subsequent reports.</p>

As other posters have pointed out, the Internet makes this &#8220;archiving&#8221; (read: PC censorship) irrelevant   &mdash;   and thank heaven for that! </p>
<p>So this is no more than a symbolic gesture. Unfortunately, it is a symbolic gesture of entirely the wrong sort. It&rsquo;s just more &#8220;pre-emptive surrender&#8221; from people who seemingly just can&rsquo;t wait to be whipped, extortion-paying dhimmis under Islamic domination. </p>
<p>Even more unfortunate is that this is being done in Denmark   &mdash;   which we&rsquo;d been led to believe was one of the last remaining places in Europe that still possessed some common sense. Apparently not. <br>

			<p>The problem is that these college educated white collar people have not done an honest days work in their life.</p>
<p>And they are filled with all sorts of theoretical leftist philosophy about race, that in an ideal perfect world will bring peace and tranquility and respect for all.</p>
<p>They will get the wake up call, when their throats and those of their families are slit like a barnyard chicken.</p>

			<p>Fools. They&rsquo;re on the Internet already, do you think that putting your copy in a steel vault somewhere will do jack squat?</p>
<p>Reacting like an ostrich months after the fact will do nothing.</p>
