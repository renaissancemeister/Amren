<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Judicial Watch, the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption, today released a U.S. Border Patrol report titled, &#8220;Mexican Government Incidents &mdash; 2006 Fiscal Year Report,&#8221; obtained under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). But for Judicial Watch&rsquo;s September, 2007 FOIA request, this information would not have been made public. The report describes 29 confirmed incidents in 2006 along the U.S.- Mexican border involving Mexican military and/or law enforcement personnel, 17 of which involved armed Mexican government agents. Among the incidents cited:</p>
<p>MEXICAN MILITARY ENCOUNTER (ARMED/INTENTIONAL) EL PASO &mdash; FORT HANCOCK STATION &mdash; At 2 P.M. on January 3, 2006, [Troopers] attempted to apprehend three vehicles believed to be smuggling contraband on I-10&hellip;As the vehicles approached the border, [Troopers] stated that a Mexican Military Humvee armed with a .50 caliber weapon and several soldiers were seen assisting smugglers return to Mexico&hellip;Officers then noticed several armed subjects dressed in fatigue type clothing unload the contraband into the Humvee. These subjects set fire to the stalled vehicle before leaving the area&hellip;</p>
<p>MEXICAN POLICE INCURSION (ARMED/INTENTIONAL) TUCSON NOGALES STATION &mdash; On June 2, 2006, a Border Patrol Agent assigned to the Nogales, Arizona station encountered two Mexican Police Officers that had illegally entered into the U.S. one mile west of the Mariposa Port of Entry&hellip;the Mexican Police Officers ran back into Mexico when ordered [by Border Patrol] to remain for questioning.</p>

			<p>The Mexican government/military are rife with corruption - the Mexican cartels, despite all this talk about &#8220;the war on drugs&#8221;, are still in control of most Mexican organisations.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d be surprised if Mexican military units *weren&rsquo;t* helping the drug lords!</p>

			<p>Lying George Bush and his lapdog, chertoff, are too busy to worry about armed Mexican (drug dealer) incursions. They&rsquo;re too busy looking for hypothetical terrorists. No wonder so many Americans no longer believe the official 9/11 story.</p>

			<p>All of this silly bureaucrateese laden report writing, document classifying, FOIA request reponse, and document censoring and declassifying could be easily (and who knows?, perhaps in a fashion more economical than writing these &#8220;reports&#8221;) eliminated by simply making the US-Mexican border strip a place where the birds just don&rsquo;t sing.</p>

<p>Wish Sheriff Joe could run this Department&hellip;  Now he&rsquo;d get the job done!</p>

			<p>I think people are missing the broader implications of this report.  It&rsquo;s assumed that these are rogue soldiers aiding criminal because they are corrupt.  I rather think the problem is much more serious than that.  These soldiers are working under orders of the mexican government.  Mexico gets its money from 4 sources&hellip;.oil, money sent back home via job theft and welfare theft&hellip;.and drug revenues.  The drug revenues rival what they get from oil.  With the near complete lack of any enforcement on the mexican side (besides token joint ops with the US), it is quite obvious that the mexican GOVERNMENT is probably getting a large amount of those drug dollars.  One thing is for certain.  They do not patrol their side stopping drug dealers and illegal aliens.</p>
<p>The only reason they aren&rsquo;t more actively involved in bringing the drugs over is this invites a military response from the US.  If you have mexican heavy vehicles and obvious soldiers moving the drugs on a regular basis, the expected response would be air strikes against them whenever they are detected.  That would mean open warfare.  Compared to our military, the mexican military is a joke.  With even these few incidents, perhaps they need a reminder.</p>

			<p>What does the government care about any of our borders?? They are too busy kissing china&rsquo;s butt and making sure the iraqi people are doing fine on our dollars&hellip;and if per chance some terrorist comes across the border they can always blame us, after all&hellip;they pass the buck so often in washington that the dollar has lost all value&hellip;they don&rsquo;t care about that either.</p>

			<p>Run for your lives, the Mexicans are coming!  Oh wait, I forgot, they&rsquo;re already here.  Over 30 million of them have invaded and infiltrated every community in America and millions more are joining them every year.  If you are unwilling to fight this  uneducated conquering enemy I suggest you learn to say, &#8220;what is thy bidding my master&#8221; in Spanish and say it to every Mexican you see.  If you grovel at their feet perhaps they will allow you and your family to live and serve them as slaves&hellip;        </p>

			<p>When an armed military crossed our border that is an act of war.<br>
But I suppose the poppy fields in Afghanistan and democracy in Iraq have priority over such trivial things as an invasion on our Nation. </p>

			<p>What is clear that a double row fence with anti-car ditches and an access lane in the middle would have stopped most of these incursions.  Where is it?</p>

			<p> If we want to destroy the drug cartels all we have to do is legalise drugs and prostitution and  say if you want to destroy yourself go right on ahead and do it and then if we treat the addiction problem and stigmatise the behavoir as hard as we do cigarrete smoking and racism we&rsquo;ll take the profit out of the trades  and control the vices while we&rsquo;re at it the taxes can be spent on more useful applications. </p>

How about legalizing it where you live and not where I do?? I&rsquo;d love to see the relative value of my house increase.</p>

<p>That sounds like a great idea.  We could set aside special legalization zones (New Orleans for example) where drugs are perfectly legal.  You&rsquo;d need a special pass in order to live there but would not be allowed to leave.  If you were caught outside the designated area, you&rsquo;d be subject to arrest.  If you were caught outside the area with drugs, you&rsquo;d be subject to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  This would be to preserve the rights of non-drug users to live a lifestyle free of the influence of drugs.  It would also solve our race/liberal problems fairly quickly.  Minorities and white liberals would naturally choose to live where they can have a lifestyle they prefer, while the rest of us can live they way we want to, away from them.</p>

<p>&gt; I used to think that Pat, but I don&rsquo;t now and here is why;  Can you imagine what would happen is drugs and prostitution were legalized with the agreesive marketing trends of today?  I bet you prostitutes would go door to door and so would drug dealers.  (Ding, dong&hellip;.. Hello sir, how are you tonight, need some dope?  No?  Well, I think you need some! - Ding, dong&hellip;.. Good evening, sir, how would you like to have some hot sex right now?  No? Well, look at - this!)</p>
<p>No kidding, funny as it sounds, it would not be funny and would probably bring it all right into your living room and life.  It would be a front for home invasion robberies and ID theft, etc., etc.!</p>

			<p>Speaking from a purely logical perspective one adult does not have the right to tell another adult what intoxicants they can or cannot imbibe.  Society has the right to protect itself by keeping inebriated people from posing a danger to others by driving under the influence for example, but that is all.  The unprecedented prohibition against alcohol in the early 20th century proved so lucrative to the criminal element and the bureaucrats they bribed that when alcohol was made legal once again Washington needed other intoxicants to make contraband.  The pain and grief caused by illicit drugs isn&rsquo;t simply caused in some cases by the drugs themselves, but by the unwarranted high cost of the drugs that leads to acts of theft and violence.  Add to that the waste of police resources utilized to fight this war they cannot win.  Since the dawn of humankind right up to the day before the criminalization of intoxicants criminal activity didn&rsquo;t accompany the trade in drugs that were legal to sell and possess.  It is as simple as that&hellip;        </p>
