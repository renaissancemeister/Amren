						<p>Fulton County school officials have a new program to encourage selected students to study after school: cold, hard cash.</p>
<p>The Fulton school system is instituting &#8220;Learn &amp; Earn,&#8221; offering 40 students from Creekside High and Bear Creek Middle schools in Fairburn $8 an hour to study after school. The privately funded program will also offer cash bonuses to students who improve in-school performance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 15-week trial run will be conducted with students in the eighth and 11th grades. The students chosen for the program were picked by school staff, based on attendance, grades, test scores and free- or reduced-lunch status. The object, according to the school district, is to determine if paying students to study will improve classroom performance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fulton schools spokesman Kirk Wilks would not release further details of the program Tuesday, saying all questions would be answered Thursday at a news conference. There will be a community kick-off Thursday at 3 p.m. in the Creekside High media center.</p>
<p>The initiative is funded by Charles Loudermilk, chairman and chief executive officer of Aaron Rents, through the Learning Makes A Difference Foundation, a local nonprofit designed to improve education.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Michael Petrilli, vice president of national and programing policy for the Fordham Foundation, based in D.C., said it seems worthwhile.</p>
<p>He said there is the concern about sending the &#8220;wrong message,&#8221; but for needy students who must work after school, the concept might be a good option.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the percentage of blacks we&rsquo;re talking about here?  This is Atlanta, so let me guess.</p>
<p>I hate to the break the news, but if you&rsquo;re having to resort to bribing students to study with cash, you&rsquo;re dealing with a lost cause.</p>

			<p>No surprise here but Creekside High School and Bear Creek Middle School are 86% and 82% black, respectively. Liberals will go to their graves tauting the virtue of these silly initiatives that, for some mysterious and unexplained reason, never seem to pan out the way liberals intend.</p>
<p>It is only a matter of time before some genius proposes the idea to directly compensate blacks not to rob, rape or murder.<br>

			<p>Yep, probably mostly black/hispanic kids. Last ditch effort by desperate schools to &#8216;uplift&rsquo; them by any means necessary. So pathetic. Just send them to trade schools. Stop wasting your time and my money.</p>

There are studies and experiments that have proven that paying people to improve their lives doesn&rsquo;t work. Self-improvement must arise from a drive within, not outside.</p>
<p>Those involved in this program will quickly learn the most important lesson: what is the minimum amount of work they need to do to get their money.</p>

			<p>McPaper had an article yesterday claiming that that &#8220;money for good grades&#8221; works.  My reaction was that punishment for bad grades used to work as well.</p>

			<p>It had better be &#8220;privately funded&#8221;, or the entire administration of the school should be fired. Americans are sick of their taxes being squandered on everything under the Sun,  except things that actually might benefit them.</p>

<p>The article neglects to state whether the administrators were seeking low-performance or high-performance students for their experiment, but I&rsquo;m betting it was the former.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to hand it to these people   &mdash;   I couldn&rsquo;t have devised a better incentive to slack off.  I can see the smart kids now:  &#8220;I used to be a straight A student, but I&rsquo;ve got to stop showing up this quarter so I can get into that special &#8216;Learn &amp; Earn&rsquo; program!&#8221;</p>

			<p>It would be FAR more effective to pay these students to stay home so that the white and asian kids that remained could actually get the benefit of an education.</p>

			<p>Maybe a few paid students will see the benefits of learning and will excel, while the others will just do it for the money.  Ghetto ethics don&rsquo;t see the long-term benefits of learning, for mainstream Black culture will tell those learning that they&rsquo;re sell-outs and &#8220;Acting White&#8221;.</p>

			<p> I think that good old fashion discipline  (That means corporal punishment!) and reintroducing the stigma of stupidity ( That means dunces caps and social banishment!) would clear up the study problem and as for money since when do my tax dollars that I work hard as hell to provide deserve to be spent pushing some kid to read and write, I mean where are the parent/parents? When I grew up in my single parent home getting A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s was the expected minimum to maintain any privilidges and continued stupidity would result in a severe lashing with razor strap and tongue! Thanks Mom!!!</p>

<p>Good luck stopping the gravy train once it starts rolling. </p>
<p>With these glorious social programs, a generous benefit becomes a God given right in the blink of an eye.  I wager come 15 weeks from now when the program is revealed to be an abject failure, we are gonna have a lot of riled up, hyperventilating obese single mothers at some public forum howling and moaning about how &#8220;greedy&#8221; school administrators are trying to take their boy&rsquo;s money and the reason the program isn&rsquo;t working is $8 isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;living wage&#8221; and with just a little more money&hellip;.</p>

<p>School has already been made too easy. GED? (Paying now is not going to put off having to pay later.) I know there are more problems in the world these days, continual world &#8216;progress&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But, now if they can&rsquo;t attend the program or the program doesn&rsquo;t last, they&rsquo;ll have another excuse for not having &#8216;achieved their dreams&rsquo; in school. </p>
<p>Individual responsibility/motivation/life choices&hellip;. (I don&rsquo;t know what motivations this private fund has, but they&rsquo;re not helping.)</p>

All will be revealed on Thursday!  I can hardly wait!  One question I have is how to differentiate actual &#8220;studying&#8221; from merely sitting at a desk and staring mindlessly at an open book?</p>

			<p>Whoever posted about trade schools is absolutely right. College college college is pushed to every kid out there and not everyone needs a 4 year batchelor degree, some are worthless. Offering a trade to kids who are not A students would give them opportunities for jobs and they would not end up with a huge student loan that they would have to pay off at a low paying job. However most black students are still offered scholarships and aid that is not availible to White students and would not have this issue. </p>

			<p>Jackie Cushman, daughter  of Newt Gingrich, and co-founder of &#8216;Learn &amp; Earn&rsquo; program. Those two probably haven&rsquo;t spent much time in Fairburn, GA and would&rsquo;t want to stay long. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that the words &#8216;bribe&rsquo; and &#8216;initiative&rsquo; refer to the same &#8216;means&rsquo; for future development, but I know we won&rsquo;t like the &#8216;end&rsquo;. </p>
