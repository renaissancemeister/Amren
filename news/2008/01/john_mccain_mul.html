						<p>We all know John McCain is terrible on immigration. For years he held America&rsquo;s sovereignty and security hostage to amnesty and increased immigration, and his newfound support for &#8220;enforcement first&#8221; is so insubstantial and transparently insincere that it insults our intelligence. He&rsquo;s so bad that Americans for Better Immigration ranks his performance in office as the worst of all the presidential candidates &mdash; including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. {snip} And as Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation has pointed out, passage of McCain&rsquo;s bill &#8220;would represent the largest expansion of the welfare state in 30 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his support for de facto open borders is merely one manifestation of a larger problem &mdash; John McCain is a multiculturalist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean he eats tacos at the Cinco de Mayo parade (nothing wrong with that!) &mdash; I mean he&rsquo;s an ideological multiculturalist. Francis Fukuyama has described the ideology of multiculturalism this way: &#8220;not just as tolerance of cultural diversity in de facto multicultural societies but as the demand for legal recognition of the rights of ethnic, racial, religious, or cultural groups.&#8221; At almost every turn over his entire public career, John McCain has supported the <i>pluribus</i> over the <i>unum.</i></p>
<p>Take bilingual education. McCain has been an enthusiastic proponent of this divisive and discredited program for years. He was honorary co-host of the 1995 convention of the National Association for Bilingual Education; <i>The New Republic</i> reported that he wrote to convention participants that &#8220;[t]o reject a native language as a tool for teaching as well as enriching our national heritage makes learning all the more difficult and makes us a poorer nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the fact that he mentions the long-discredited &#8220;transition&#8221; rationale for bilingual education, McCain has embraced foreign-language maintenance as the real goal, buying into the &#8220;we didn&rsquo;t cross the border, the border crossed us&#8221; justification for Hispanic group rights. This is what he means with his frequent references to the historical primacy of Spanish in Arizona.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More recently, he voted for the Salazar amendment to his 2006 amnesty bill, which would have codified Clinton&rsquo;s Executive Order 13166. That order enshrines official, legally mandated multilingualism, requiring all government agencies and all recipients of federal funds to provide any services in any foreign language requested. {snip} With his eye no doubt on the coming presidential race, he flip-flopped and voted against the very same amendment this past summer during the debate over his most recent amnesty bill.</p>
<p>In last June&rsquo;s presidential debate in New Hampshire, when Wolf Blitzer asked if any of the candidates opposed official English, would they speak up &mdash; McCain spoke up, starting with a weasely &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s fine,&#8221; then expounding on the language rights of American Indians. Another part of his response was revealing: &#8220;Everybody knows that English has to be learned if anyone ever wants to move up the economic ladder. That is obvious.&#8221; True enough, but that begs the question: The source of the public appeal of official English is that it asserts not merely a practical reason for newcomers to learn English but a moral obligation to do so. Throughout his public life McCain has repeatedly rejected the idea of such an obligation.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is more than language, of course. McCain has also supported racial preferences and racial-identity politics. As Ward Connerly wrote in NR:</p>
<blockquote>
[In 1996], when a number of Republicans and others in Arizona sought to pass a bill in that state&rsquo;s legislature outlawing race preferences, we were told by several Republican legislators that they had received calls from Sen. John McCain urging them not to support such a measure because &mdash; again, as always &mdash; it might &#8220;send the wrong message.&#8221;
</blockquote>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He did likewise in opposing Arizona&rsquo;s Proposition 200 in 2006, which would have required proof of citizenship to register to vote, and legal status to access certain state benefits, saying that it would result in &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even on trivial matters, McCain adopts the racial-grievance worldview of the multiculturalists. When speaking to LULAC in 2000, the AP reports him saying this:</p>
<blockquote>
I am ashamed when demeaning stereotypes of Hispanic Americans substitute in our popular entertainment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for honest and realistic portrayals,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;I know that for you to achieve fairer representation in popular media, you will have to achieve a greater representation in the executive suites and boardrooms of corporate media.
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s not all. McCain also supported the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, which would have established a parallel government for people of Hawaiian ethnic origin. And on the Kennewick Man controversy, he sided with the American Indian tribes against the scientists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, and American nationality, not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house.</p>

			<p>If John McCain wins the nomination then it becomes a moot point as to whether you vote republican or democrat because Amnesty for Criminal Illegal Aliens will be a done deal and all your calls and e-mails to Washington will be like your trip to the polls&hellip;..30 minutes of your life wasted that you can&rsquo;t get back.</p>

			<p>The fact that John McCain is now considered the &#8220;front runner&#8221; to win the Republican nomination just confirms my fears that the vast majority of Americans are hopelessly uninformed.  I&rsquo;ve gotten into countless arguments with McCain supporters who insist that McCain never supported Amnesty and, no surprise, this supposed &#8220;Straight Talker&#8221; actually makes this assertion at his rallies. Of course, the MSM never calls him out on it.  As much as I distrust him, I am starting to become convinced that Romney may be the only hope we have at getting a somewhat decent conservative nominee this election.  The fact that the MSM has virtually endorsed McCain and tries to marginalize Romney every chance they get seems to make me believe that maybe he is not so bad after all.  I originally supported Ron Paul but, at this point, nothing is more important than stopping McCain.  If he gets the nomination we can literally kiss our country good bye and the conservative movement as we know it will be shattered.</p>

			<p>The entire idea of the American people today being able to pick a good President seems far fetched.  Doing something lasting about Third World Immigration is going to be even tougher.</p>
<p>For exhibit A, I give you the ordinary light bulb.</p>
<p>Where was the public outrage when the President and Congress recently banned the sale of the light bulb in 2012?  There was none!</p>
<p>When I mentioned the banning to some acquaintances, it was met, at least half the time, with approval!</p>
<p>If we have come down so far that we are allowing the government to tell us that the light bulb, which is a fabulous invention and has done no harm, is illegal, how much more brainwashed can we get?</p>
<p>The average American is letting the government run their lives.  Things our forefathers would have rebeled over are met with an accepting shug of the shoulders.</p>
<p>Where does it all end?&hellip;..  With Obama as President and another 200 million Third Worlders at the trough.</p>
<p>These people (the Americans) are who we expect to start another civil war?  Don&rsquo;t count on it.</p>
<p>As I like to ask, &#8220;Is there anything that the government could do that would make you take up arms?&#8221;  I am usually greeted by a blank stare.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Even on trivial matters, McCain adopts the racial-grievance worldview of the multiculturalists. When speaking to LULAC in 2000, the AP reports him saying this:</p>

<p>The word multiculturalist is synonymous with the word traitor; of all the presidential hopefuls, none are lower on this score than Senator No Brains McCain. He is beyond all shadow of a doubt the worst possible &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; choice in the primaries, and even in the general election should it come down to a contest between him and Hillary or Obama. And while some here will balk at that statement, while some will think &lsquo;well at least he is a white man,&rdquo; I for one would counter that he is nothing of the sort. He is not white in any sense of the word that you or I would use that qualifier; what he is, is a conniving Red swine.</p>
<p>Right there above in his own words spoken at a LULAC coven, he whines about the &ldquo;demeaning stereotypes&rdquo; of Hispanics as portrayed in the media; however, if I recall correctly, didn&rsquo;t this cur dog taunt an unemployed American protesting the invasion of these mestizo wage competitors, by insinuating that he would not pick lettuce even if offered $ 15.00 an hour to do it. Thus implying that this fellow was the &ldquo;typical lazy American&rdquo; of 1980s Japanese yore and our current treacherous Red elites. That was the incident that had his primary candidacy in the toilet, earlier this year. That is until the ever &ldquo;unbiased&rdquo; media resurrected him like some satanic political version of Lazarus. </p>
<p>Speaking of which, isn&rsquo;t it funny that they seem so desperate to have him as the Republican nominee? They know one of their own, and have promoted his candidacy well beyond its expected shelf life. He should have been politically dead and buried a long time ago; that he isn&rsquo;t, that he has been sustained as the &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; candidate to beat Hillary or Obama, is evidence enough of just how fashionably anti-white this wretched imp really is.    </p>
<p>In the end, I will vote for Romney in the primaries and pray for the best,</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>Amnesty John McCain is horrible.Terrible on immigration and every other racial issue.It must be a priority to oppose his bid for the presidency. He is an unstable man with a terrible temper.It is a two candidate race between Romney and McCain.I will vote for Romney.<br>
I just received the Number USA rating of the candidates and Romney was 28.Four points higher than Paul and Huckabee.A vote for Paul is a wasted vote. he is under5% in polls.I vote on race and Romney is the best-however imperfect.Stop Amnesty McCain.</p>

			<p>McCain is a smarmy weasel who belives he always knows best despite the overwhelming evidence by the American people&rsquo;s opinion  to the contrary. The Gang of 14 is another example of McCain going against the will of the Republican Party.  McCain, Graham and 5 other Repubs joined with 7 dems to defeat the &#8220;nuclear option&#8221; that would change the rules of the senate to prevent the dems from filerbusting conservative judicial nominees. McCain&rsquo;s outrages over the years against Republicans and American in general is truely shocking. Hopefully, he will be defeated tomorrow in Fla. and again defeated on Feb.5 and hopefully be flushed out of the senate by his next election.</p>

 Voters who are supporting McCain may soon find that they&rsquo;ve<br>
stepped into a trap; that the candidate who got a free pass<br>
from the left-liberal news media through the primaries is<br>
suddenly having his involvement in the &#8220;Keating Five&#8221; spread<br>
all over the headlines.</p>
<p> Either a McCain candidacy or a McCain presidency would be<br>
a disaster. </p>

			<p>McCain has an ABI rating worse than any democrat. At first opportunity he would eagerly and immediately sell American citizenship for the price of a small fine. And then dispense with the fine. Hordes of third-world criminals will not be punished for their crime of invasion, or their countless felonies since. Instead, they will be greatly rewarded with the most precious title in the world&hellip;U.S. Citizen. That reward would amount to the biggest amnesty in the history of the earth, no matter how much McCain might deny it. Citizenship for 30 million of the least worthy humans on the planet, and then to 100 million more of their relatives through chain migration. Unacceptable. American soldiers and patriots of generations past would see the value of their lives and dedication reduced to nearly nothing. They, and we, deserve better. </p>
<p>McCain, an American hero? He did contribute something once. Something foul a thousand times since. In my opinion, none of the Founding Fathers would stand in the same room with McCain, and neither will I. Vote for him just because the weasel adds an &#8216;R&rsquo; behind his name? Never.</p>
<p>No amnesty, no sanctuary. And none for McCain.</p>

			<p>McCain clearly is not unique. He is representative of elite thinking on matters of race and culture. Why? The only conclusion I can come to is that our elites simply have no experience of what it is to live cheek by jowl with blacks and hispanics. They live in a bubble, a protected bubble. It&rsquo;s all unreal to them. What&rsquo;s real is saying the right things, being praised by other elites for saying the right things and feeling good about yourself. As for The People?..let them eat cake.</p>

			<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there a novel about 40 years ago called &#8220;The Manchurian Candidate&#8221;, about an American who had been brainwashed by his communist captors, and years later was about to be elected President?  The scenario may not really be true in McCain&rsquo;s case, but would his views be any different if it was?  </p>

			<p>I think McCain is a little &#8220;off&#8221; because of his treatment as a POW in Vietnam. He suffered tremendously and today it&rsquo;s obvious he has limited use of his arms. I would be surprised if he could comb his own hair. He is noted for an explosive temper and is avoided by many of his fellow senators because of it. He would also be the oldest man ever elected president. And he has a history of being open borders all the way. McCain&rsquo;s presidency would be an absolute disaster. I&rsquo;m sick of him and while I&rsquo;m not that wild about Romney I feverently hope Romney beats McCain in the upcoming primaries. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;&hellip;his newfound support for &ldquo;enforcement first&rdquo; is so insubstantial and transparently insincere that it insults our intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was beginning to think I was the only one who saw that.  And immediately, too, I might add, right as he was announcing he wanted to make it plain he wanted secure borders first, but failed to include a retraction of his amnesty scheme.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening for some perceptive talk show host to denounce that, but apparently it flew right by them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But his support for de facto open borders is merely one manifestation of a larger problem &mdash; John McCain is a multiculturalist.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it is due in large part to the people who advise him, which are part of the Bronfman group,(Seagrams Seven) Neo-Cons who have the same views as the ones who advise Bush.</p>
<p>Before I can criticize the people who are supporting him right now I have say the biggest disappointments are the talk show hosts who should be keeping them informed.  Rush Limbaugh is the only one I&rsquo;m aware of who is denouncing this man, as he should.</p>

I spotted a clip on TV last evening with Obama and the &#8220;chosen&#8221; ones chanting, &#8220;Si,se puede!&#8221; How many illegals do they want? How many does it take to ruin a once-proud nation? answer: 12 million - we passed that long ago!</p>

			<p>Amnesty John is the worst possible candidate of all the presidential aspirants on BOTH sides of the aisle. He is on the wrong side of virtually every issue that is important to the continued sovereignty of the United States and it&rsquo;s survival as a nation. He is also very unstable and the thought of John McCain with his finger on the nuclear trigger gives me the willies..</p>
<p>My first choice was Duncan Hunter but when he dropped out I began looking at Romney. He looked like the best of the mainstream candidates and the only one that could keep McCain from locking up the Republican nomination. I urge all the readers of this site to begin supporting Romney, I, like many of you, also like Ron Paul but I don&rsquo;t think he has a chance of stopping McCain.</p>

			<p>Lets bring in more Vietnamese.  They can&rsquo;t sneak across the border, but I am sure that their economic situation is no better than Mexico&rsquo;s.  Then we can have all products, signs and education translated into Vietnamese.  Would Mr. McCain be comfortable with that?</p>

			<p>If you look at McCain&rsquo;s foreign policy issues he has always taken the most belligerent confrontational position possible. This is the guy who wants to stay in Iraq for 100 years and says there will be more wars. Very scary guy.</p>

			<p>     It&rsquo;s easy to see why the MSM supports McCain. If he gets the nomination, it will destroy the Republican Party. Conservatives, like me, will vote for a third party candidate or just stay home on election day and the Republicans will be lucky if they can elect a local dog catcher. In the unlikely event he wins, ( even a blind pig finds an acorn once in a while ) what&rsquo;s the difference between McCain and Hillary or Obama ? Six of one or half-a-dozen of the other.</p>

It&rsquo;s only a matter of time. There is one thing though. Try identifiying these individuals. Instead of saying the ACLU this, The New York Times that. Print the names of these people in the ACLU and the New York Times who are trying to destroy the white race. We could bomb them with e-mails. They would have to watch their backsides.</p>

Traditionalist who favor small government, border integrity, a sane immigration policy and sound money have no choice but to coalesce around a new party.  This might be the right time for libertarians to get serious. </p>

			<p>tacitus, I am voting for Paul no matter what.  Voting for the lesser of two evils is still voting for evil.  Of all the candidates in either party, Paul is the only one who will eliminate our $500 billion annual federal budget deficit in a humane and achievable way   &mdash;   by ending the empire.  No one has given me a coherent explanation for why we still have troops in Japan, 62 years after we won the war.  Paul is also against illegal immigration, and against birth right citizenship for children born to illegals.  Paul is not a racist (and didn&rsquo;t write those articles that appeared in his newsletter) but he is against affirmative action, recognizing that it is just a politically correct form of racial discrimination.  People like Paul don&rsquo;t win precisely because too many people say, &#8220;I like Paul best, but he&rsquo;s not going to win, so I&rsquo;ll vote for this media approved candidate instead.&#8221;  And then they whine that things never get better.</p>
<p>For the first time you have the chance to vote for an honest man for President.  Don&rsquo;t pass it up.</p>

			<p>I read an article where a woman who considered immigration her #1 issue voted for McCain. She never even heard of the McCain-Kennedy bill and just assumed McCain shared her anti-immigration views.</p>
<p>Many of the people who support and vote for John McCain honestly have no idea how liberal he is. There are lot&rsquo;s of uninformed voters out there. They are generally apathetic but feel it&rsquo;s their patriotic duty to vote. they pay no attention to the issues or where the candidates stand. They often vote on pure emotion. Yet their vote counts just as much as those who take the time and interest to be fully informed.</p>
<p> This explains why John McCain will probably get the nomination despite the fact that the conservative base loathes him more than any other politician.</p>

			<p>I was talking to my neighbor the other day and I ask him who he was &#8220;leaning&#8221; toward for president. He said &#8220;probably McCain.&#8221; I then took him inside and had him look at McCain on ontheissues.org and he was shocked to say the least. He said he was never aware of how liberal he was until I showed him this. He said all he knew was that McCain was a war hero and a P.O W. and he felt he &#8220;deserved&#8221; his vote. Not any more, he will now go for Romney. This neighbor of mine is like ALOT of White Americans- - he can tell you all about ANY ballgame in the last 50 yrs.[scores,who the players were etc.] but does &#8220;0&#8221; research on who will run this country. Sad, but true! Another good thing that came out of this talk with him is that I turned him on to this site. I had to &#8220;pry&#8221; him off my computer and told him &#8220;you know, you CAN get this site on YOUR computer.&#8221; With that, he ran out and went home. Didn&rsquo;t see him the rest of the day!!!!</p>

			<p>John as always I enjoyed your comments on McCain, right on the mark, but he is even more insulting than you wrote. He said, believe it or not, that Americans wouldn&rsquo;t pick lettuce for FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. I had to check the sources because I did not want to believe it myself, when first hearing it. Whoever votes for him certainly thinks low of his fellow Americans.</p>

			<p>Well, here is an article and link from the FOX NEWS website, that details just what a lowlife bottom feeder, Comrade No Brains is. If he would sellout the fools stupid enough to be his &ldquo;fundraisers,&rdquo; is there any question he would do the same to our country? Oh wait, he already attempted it with that paragon of virtue Teddy Kennedy, in their jointly sponsored amnesty bill. </p>
<p>This article not only proves how corrupt and debased this Red weasel is, it also demonstrates just what the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media did for him as well, up to New Hampshire. They basically gave this traitor life support, by pretending that this multicultural zombie still had a viable campaign, when all he really had was derailed caboose of cynical desperation and debt. </p>
<p>It is said his campaign is now on &ldquo;solid financial ground,&rdquo; but what does that mean? Has he got five pennies in a shoebox and another &ldquo;special life insurance policy&rdquo; called Marxist media hype still sustaining him?</p>
<p>Read on and draw your own conclusions:</p>

<p>The Lengths John McCain Went to for His Campaign to Stay afloat</p>
<p>Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:</p>
<p>Blood Money</p>
<p>John McCain&rsquo;s presidential campaign was so strapped for cash last November that he offered his fundraising lists as collateral for a $3 million dollar line of credit  &mdash;  and took out a special life insurance policy to seal the deal.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reports the policy was necessary to ensure the continued value of the fund-raising lists  &mdash;  which would not maintain their worth if he were not alive.</p>
<p>McCain&rsquo;s Internet fundraising consultant says  &mdash;  &#8220;I can&rsquo;t imagine any other campaign doing what he did. We were down to nobody. To nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And one campaign finance expert says  &mdash;  &#8220;It was a big gamble, but I think one of the most important strategic moves the McCain campaign has made.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCain used the money to concentrate on the New Hampshire primary  &mdash;  which he won. Now the campaign is said to be back on solid financial ground.</p>

			<p>Thank you John PM for making the effort to further expose this creep. I&rsquo;m again sadly moved to ask those Americans supporting this guy, can you really be this uninformen or outright stupid?</p>
