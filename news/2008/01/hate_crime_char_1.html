						<p>Prosecutors in Baltimore have decided not to charge the nine middle school students accused in the beating of a 26-year-old woman on a city bus with a hate crime as a judge postponed their trial yesterday until Jan. 31.</p>
<p>Judge Edward R.K. Hargadon, the head of the city&rsquo;s juvenile judges, granted a request from the state to postpone a Jan. 4 trial date despite objections from the juveniles&rsquo; attorneys. A hearing on the teenagers&rsquo; home-detention status will take place Jan. 4.</p>
<p>In court yesterday, Assistant State&rsquo;s Attorney Janet S. Hankin requested the addition of two charges: malicious destruction and disorderly conduct. The teens had previously been charged with aggravated assault and destruction of property.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys said they had not been informed of the additional charges, which will be dealt with at the Jan. 4 hearing.</p>
<p>The Maryland Transit Administration Police Force, which has jurisdiction on buses, had said early in the investigation that it was reviewing the case as a possible racially motivated incident. All nine suspects are black, and the victim is white.</p>
<p>But the charges listed at yesterday&rsquo;s juvenile hearing did not include hate crimes.</p>
<p>Margaret T. Burns, a spokeswoman for the city state&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;s office, would say only that the charging process is complete, and that no more charges are expected to be filed. She would not elaborate, noting confidentiality laws surrounding juvenile criminal cases.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that to pursue a hate-crime violation, they would have to prove intent, that the attack was &#8220;because of another&rsquo;s race, color, religious beliefs or national origin.&#8221; Interviews with the victim and some of the young suspects indicate that racial slurs might have been used during the fight, but that the fracas might have started over a fight for a seat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Dec. 4 attack on Sarah Kreager was the first of four violent incidents this month aboard MTA buses. Two passengers on a No. 64 bus in Brooklyn were attacked by five men Dec. 10. Eight days later, a girl was stabbed in the arm on a No. 51 bus near Mondawmin Mall. And on Dec. 26, a 14-year-old boy was shot and wounded on a bus in West Baltimore.</p>
<p>The attack on Kreager in the 800 block of W. 33rd St. led to the arrests of nine Robert Poole Middle School students. The six boys and three girls, all 14 or 15 years old, were charged as juveniles with aggravated assault and destruction of property. Kreager, who has been put in a witness protection program, suffered broken facial bones and other injuries after being punched, kicked and dragged off the bus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to [Sarah Kreager&rsquo;s] account, she sat in the rear of the bus and was threatened by a teenage girl who said her friend wanted the seat. Kreager said she went to sit an another part of the bus with Ennis and said to him, &#8220;They don&rsquo;t got no manners,&#8221; causing one of the girls to take a swing at them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s pretty standard now. In most jurisdictions &#8220;hate crime&#8221; laws are applied only when the perp is white. <br>
Seems to me that that was the original purpose of the laws. </p>

			<p>This sort of thing-multiple black assaliants and one white victim-has been commonplace in San Francisco for decades now and there has never been a hate crime charge in any of the cases.A white victim was beaten and severely brain damaged on a bus by a black mob, and there were no hate crime charges.If you are white and use public transportation, always assume that you are on your own as far as safety goes.San Francisco sorely desires our own version of Bernhard Goetz, but we havent gotten one yet.I hope this changes soon.</p>

<p><br>
This is what needs to change in hate crimes laws.  Quite frankly, ANY violent crime where the victim and the criminal are of a different race, should trigger a special circumstances, hate crime statute.  This could easily be sold to liberals and blacks who are too stupid to know that 85% of the time, this will mean draconian punishment for a black, not a white.</p>

			<p>*Interviews with the victim and some of the young suspects indicate that racial slurs might have been used during the fight, but that the fracas might have started over a fight for a seat.*</p>
<p>Imagine: 10 white youths enter a bus, target and gang up on a black woman, demand that she give up her seat for absolutely no reason, and when she refuses, they violently assault here without provocation while repeatedly calling her a certain racially-charged expletive that begins with &#8220;n&#8221;.  Would this be viewed as a mere &#8220;fight for a seat?&#8221;  No, I don&rsquo;t think so.  But when it comes to White victims and black perpetrators / cops / prosecutors / juries, the law turn a blind eye.</p>

After the &#8220;justice&#8221; system gets through throwing out all the charges, one by one,  against these fun loving kiddies, it is likely they will still suffer from having their free bus passes having been taken away, but a smart lawyer should be able to get them back.</p>

			<p>Another poster has previously pointed out, the well paid government employees of Baltimore&rsquo;s MTA are almost 100 percent black and look nothing like the rest of America. I&rsquo;m quite sure the MTA emphasis affirmative action, diversity, and sensitivity too, as do the private companies operating in Baltimore. </p>

			<p>So who are these prosecutors, actually? What motivates them? Why would they choose to withhold a charge with one set of suspects, but use it with another?</p>
<p>I mean, the central point in this article hinges on a decision made by a specific group of people who have a specific set of professional responsibilities.</p>

			<p>So why aren&rsquo;t Whites in the streets marching and protesting these &#8220;hate&#8221; crime laws that are directed ONLY at Whites? Even a White victim gets no justice with these ADL instituted laws being shoved down our throats! Come on White people it is time to take a stand and demand our country back. Are we all so foolish as to think this is our country any longer? Remaining silent never got us a hill of beans.</p>

			<p>And if that woman were black and those kids white we all KNOW the first charges brought would be under the hate crime laws.  This is blatant discrimination against whites, as usual.  But I don&rsquo;t see this making headline news as it would if the race roles were reversed.</p>

			<p>BTW, that &ldquo;because of another&rsquo;s race, color, religious beliefs or national origin&rdquo; qualifier that makes fighting someone because of his national origin a hate crime will make it pretty difficult to fight back if Mexicans launch armed invasion of the U.S. For how would you justify shooting at soldiers of invading army (and not at, say, soldiers of U.S. Army) other than that they were Mexicans?</p>
<p>The bottom line is that we keep electing morons with law degrees that pass laws of scandalously low quality. If a software company would try to sell this kind of badly flawed code then they would have been out of business now.<br>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s what we need to try: In ANY case where the perps and victims are of different races, or where the victim of the crime belives that a hate crime might have occurred, the case goes before a randomly-chosen panel. The case is not presented personally, but the panel will read transcrips and all the evidence. All the panel will know is that the perp and victim were of different races, and the transcript will be purged of anything that might give a reader any indication of who was what race. The panelists will not be able to discuss the matter between themselves, just read and vote.</p>
<p>That might not work with high-profile crimes, but it might be worth a shot otherwise.</p>
<p>BTW, if you want to see a video of the victim of black-on-white violence describing the attack, you can check out this link:  </p>

<p>I categorically hate hate-crime laws.  But given that they exist: Why is it necessary to prove intent?  Intent is never required in cases of alleged employment discrimination.  There, the presumption is that racial bigotry is to blame for any disparity in hiring or promotion outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what needs to change in hate crimes laws. Quite frankly, ANY violent crime where the victim and the criminal are of a different race, should trigger a special circumstances, hate crime statute.

			<p>This reinforces why blacks should not have political power over whites. They are too racist to deal fairly with whites. They look at power as an opportunity to &#8220;get even with whitey&#8221;. The mayor of Baltimore and other officials have no interest in justice. They know their &#8220;constiuents&#8221; want to see this kind of abusive treatment of any unfortunate white are live and/or have be in Baltimore. This has shown many times for example when David Dinkins was mayor of NYC,or when Wilder was governor of Virginia. Dinkins allowed and encouraged outrageous, lawbreaking by blacks. Wilder,for no logical reason, pardoned or commuted the sentence of Allen Iverson freeing him from prison where he was serving a sentence of attempted murder. Who can forget the cheering, and other expressions of happiness by blacks when the multiple murder O.J. Simpson was acquitted despite tons of evidence including DNA evidence. Blacks feel they can justify any violence towards whites by claiming the victim(s) used the N word.</p>

			<p>Just like with the Jena six attacks, and the Long Beach attacks. Once again, Blacks get a free pass for ganging up on whites, and violently assaulting them. Small wonder such crimes are occuring more and more frequently, when none of them are ever punished. This is also exactly why I have no pity for them when they complain about Hispanics targeting them.</p>

			<p>If mythically the reverse had occured 9 white students has beaten up a black female what do you think the verdict would have been? HATE HATE HATE &hellip;<br>
Isnt it funny how the only so called white hate crimes they can come up with are the these old black and white 50s and 60s film clips where cops try to keep the order and use dogs or fire hoses? <br>
Yet we have millions of clips of modern film footage pics etc  of black hate crimes against whites by the millions of times and this is never shown.</p>

<p>True, but as I and many others have repeatedly posted:  Speaking out puts one&rsquo;s career, pension and the safety of one&rsquo;s loved ones and own life at great risk.</p>
<p>This is how hog-tied Whites are in their own country by their own government. The very laws upon which this country was founded do not apply to us and are often not enforced when we are involved (as in the specious Hate Crimes Law). This breakdown of the Rule of Law (and our economy)is what is going to break this country apart and plunge us into an era of violence. </p>
<p>California will lead the way as our local politicians legislate mightily to disarm us, tax us to death and welcome and encourage ever more uneducated, unskilled, entitlement-draining, White-hating leeches into the state.</p>
<p>I cannot afford so speak out as I need my job and pension and I would never put my family at risk. I&rsquo;m sure many other Whites are in the exact same position and only vent behind closed doors or on sites such as this one. Some have written that they are nervous posting here anonymously on their home computers.</p>
<p>The one thing I am able to do at the moment without risk is donate money to causes which promote the interests I believe in.<br>
I also trust these sites to not reveal my identity.</p>

			<p>In view of the gushing enthusiasm the MSM expresses over the relatively meaningless Iowa Caucas victory by Obama the question is why would an almost totally white state vote for a black candidate with almost no experience who has ties to anti-white individuals.It shows how brainwashed whites are.The malicious disinformation by the mainstream media is illustrated by the lack of coverage of this vicious assault. If whites don&rsquo;t access sites like this on the internet they would never know about the outrageous assaults on whites in Baltimore and the racist behavior of Baltimore&rsquo;s black mayor towards the victims.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;racial slurs might have been used&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah the wonder of the passive voice.  Yes the racial slurs just might have happened to occur.  It is so indefinite.  Maybe a black let slip something unseemly, but of course true about his white oppressor, or more likely a white called an innocent black the N-word.  We will never know.    All we know is that racial slurs might have been used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;the fracas might have started over a fight for a seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A seat on the bus, how racist of a white not to be aware that blacks can be hurt by the public placing of a white derriere on a bus seat.  Burning crosses, lawn jockeys, nooses, Confederate flags, the N-word, a nappy head, a hoe that was not raped, and now a white buttocks on a bus seat; all things whites must be sensitive to because blacks in America find them offensive.  <br>

Anon. poster said: </p>
<p>&#8220;ANY violent crime where the victim and the criminal are of a different race, should trigger a special circumstances, hate crime statute. This could easily be sold to liberals and blacks who are too stupid to know that 85% of the time, this will mean draconian punishment for a black, not a white.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this idea has real merit. We should try to &#8220;sell&#8221; this one to libs and minorities under the guise of &#8220;expanding hate-crime legislation&#8221; and &#8220;making society more fair&#8221;   &mdash;   then sit back and watch it blow up in their faces. </p>
<p>I have friends in a Jewish part of LA that is nowhere near a ghetto. Yet they and many of their friends have been mugged while walking in their own neighborhood   &mdash;   by blacks who pull up alongside them in cars. The black perps, therefore, have made a point of driving from their ghettos to target a specific ethnic area where they expect the pickin&rsquo;s will be easy. No doubt their &#8220;rationale&#8221; is along the lines of, &#8220;All dem Jews be wearin&rsquo; Rolexes an&rsquo; be carryin&rsquo; stoopit bank! An&rsquo; dem Jews don&rsquo; fight back, neither!&#8221;  </p>
<p>That sure sounds like a racially-specific &#8220;hate&#8221; crime to me. If we could get it charged as such, it could set a precedent that might benefit ALL white people. <br>

			<p>Why all these TECHNICALITIES? A crime is a crime and the reason someone commited the crime really is of little importance. What is important is that they did PERIOD.<br>
Joe robbed a bank to buy a new car he couldn&rsquo;t afford on his own. Jim robbed a bank because he didn&rsquo;t like the manager. Tom robbed a ban because he was bored. Who gives a rats a** why they did it? The fact is they did it and the punishment should be the same..<br>

			<p>why would an almost totally white state vote for a black candidate?<br>
<p>/&gt;<br>
You forgot to mention that these were Democrats (not the state) that voted for </p>
<p>him. They, most likely, wanted to send a message that they were not racists. </p>
<p>Besides, you don&rsquo;t believe the majority of Democrats make rational choices while </p>
<p>voting, do you?</p>
<p>Posted by A Reader at 4:50 PM on January 4</p>
<p>This is exactly what I thought when I saw the interviews of whites drooling over their black savior.  I honostly don&rsquo;t see how any white, particularly white man, can vote for a Democrat when the democratic party openly endorses discrimination against whites in favor of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  Insanity.</p></p>

			<p>eqal protection under the law? you cant pass a law for one person that dont apply to another person? pedge of allegiance says and justice for all? all ideals that are not put into practice. action speaks louder than words. blacks know this so they march no matter whether their brothers and sisters are right or wrong. theres no solidarity with whites. its hooray for me forget you. whites try to organize and the gov will find some way to shut them down. did they have cameras on the bus? it dont matter i never saw the rodney king vid played the whole way except on rush limbaugh. when i did i knew the news is all slanted against whites. would someone come up with a solution.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m live in Baltimore and have been watching this story develop. The black girl who was held most responsible for beating the white woman has some attorney claiming that the black girl is the victim because the white woman provoked her! Students from this same black middle school have beaten and taunted other whites on busses here and in the neighborhood, too. The whole transportation system in this sorry city belongs to the blacks.  White people who ride take big risks. I wouldn&rsquo;t get on a bus in Baltimore if I got a free lifetime pass.</p>
<p>By the way, John Galt, I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more! I&rsquo;ve seen more white men in this area wearing &#8220;vote for obama&#8221; T shirts than anyone else.  It makes me sick on several levels.  </p>

			<p>Omarosa is a perfect example of what an educated black woman is truly like in real life. She tries to present herself as a professional, highly educated, and classy woman on the outside. She uses big words, acts superior and condescending. Oh yeah, if you look fast, she could be just like a white or an asian woman. </p>
<p>However, as with many blacks when you delve into her behavior towards others, work/personal history, and background, you see a much different picture.</p>
<p>She lies, accuses anyone of being a racist, is verbally abusive, bullying, and is extremely aggressive and unladylike. She is a grotesque parody of what normal white and asian women are like in real life. </p>
<p>Most blacks cannot get ahead on merit alone, it is common to see some level of deception and accusations of racial discrimination to rip money off of government, workplace, and people.</p>
<p>They are scared of losing this privilege, they don&rsquo;t care about what is right, that&rsquo;s why they ignore anything that isn&rsquo;t beneficial to them. </p>
<p>Very few blacks are going to actively help a hurt white or asian person or to lobby to redress wrongs. They don&rsquo;t have the mental capacity or the personality to act on principle.</p>
<p>No other race likes blacks because of these reasons. Whites, stop being stupid and don&rsquo;t let blacks bamboozle us into making buffoons out of our government, legal, and judicial system. </p>

			<p>&#8220;during the fight, but that the fracas might have started over a fight for a seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at how the media LIES! NINE black &#8220;youths&#8221; viciously attack and beat a white woman and this is called a &#8220;fight&#8221; and a &#8220;fracas&#8221;????!!!! <br>
Reminds me of when in Kansas City MO at 27th &amp; Benton a mob of black &#8220;youths&#8221; started attacking non-black motorists including pulling a Chinese man out of his car, beating him to within an inch of his life, then turning his car over and torching it, and the Kansas City Star later would simply refer to it as a &#8220;melee&#8221;!!!</p>

			<p>&#8220;The eternal question being what is the MOTIVE or REASON for our controlled media to go about deliberately hiding the truth from White Americans. That there IS a motive or hidden agenda stands to reason, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple: to make the White majority into second-class citizens. You can&rsquo;t, obviously, have a dominant, nationalistic majority standing in the way of the Marxist plan to &#8220;socialize&#8221; the United States, culturally and economically. Thus, illegal immigration must go forward, with &#8220;hate crime&#8221; and other discriminatory laws aimed at White America to insure that we, as a whole, are finally dispossessed of our inheritance. It&rsquo;s straight out of Trotsky&rsquo;s playbook. </p>

<p>&#8220;Strong black women&#8221; is an oxymoron. Most of them tout themselves as being &#8216;survivors&rsquo; as if they survived a holocaust, and of being strong. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s so strong about being a drug user, a hooker, or a criminal and then trying to reform. I think it&rsquo;s just not acceptable to become an irresponsible wreck in the first place. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they survive since they are just staying on with their criminal relatives. They are just as scary and violent as the black males. </p>
<p>The mind games these people play with themselves and others to put a postitive/heroic spin on their depravity, irresponsibility, and stupidity is astounding.</p>
