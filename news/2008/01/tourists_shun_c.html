						<p>Assaults on American tourists have brought hard times to hotels and restaurants that dot Mexican beaches just south of the border from San Diego.</p>
<p>Surfers and kayakers are frightened to hit the waters of the northern stretch of Mexico&rsquo;s Baja California peninsula, long popular as a weekend destination for U.S. tourists. Weddings have been canceled. Lobster joints a few steps from the Pacific were almost empty on the usually busy New Year&rsquo;s weekend.</p>
<p>Americans have long tolerated shakedowns by police who boost salaries by pulling over motorists for alleged traffic violations, and tourists know parts of Baja are a hotbed of drug-related violence. But a handful of attacks since summer by masked, armed bandits &mdash; some of whom used flashing lights to appear like police &mdash; marks a new extreme that has spooked even longtime visitors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Baja California peninsula is known worldwide for clean and sparsely populated beaches, lobster and margaritas and blue waters visited by whales and dolphins. Surfers love the waves; fishermen catch tuna, yellowtail and marlin. Food and hotels are cheap.</p>
<p>News of harrowing assaults on American tourists has begun to overshadow that appeal in the northern part of the peninsula, home to drug gangs and the seedy border city of Tijuana. The comparatively isolated southern tip, with its tony Los Cabos resort, remains safer and is still popular with Hollywood celebrities, anglers and other foreign tourists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexican officials acknowledge crime has threatened a lifeblood of Baja&rsquo;s economy. In Playas de Rosarito, a city of 130,000, police were forced to surrender their weapons last month for testing to determine links to any crimes. Heavily armed men have patrolled City Hall since a failed assassination attempt on the new police chief left one officer dead. On Thursday the bullet-riddled bodies of a Tijuana police official and another man were found dumped near the beach.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tourist visits to Baja totaled about 18 million in 2007, down from 21 million the previous year, Escobedo said. Hotel occupancy dropped about 5 percentage points to 53 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the city&rsquo;s Puerto Nuevo tourist enclave, which offers $20 lobster dinners and $1 margaritas, restaurant managers said sales were down as much as 80 percent from last year. One Saturday afternoon in October, masked bandits wielding pistols walked the streets and kidnapped two men &mdash; an American and a Spanish citizen &mdash; who were later released unharmed. Two people who were with them were shot and wounded.</p>

			<p>This opinion isn&rsquo;t going to be very popular here, but I have to say it anyway.</p>
<p>Some American tourists in Mexico bring some of the hate and violence directed against them by Mexicans on themselves.</p>
<p>After all, let&rsquo;s say you were a financially indignant Mexican living inland in any given tourist trap Mexican beach town, such as Acapulco.  Let&rsquo;s say that, a couple of times a year, young white Americans come down to your country, your city, your beaches, to swill, screw, glutton, and chug beer.  In spite of the economic benefit from such tourists, average Mexicans don&rsquo;t see a peso of it.  So what incentive would you have not to commit or condone acts of violence against the &#8220;Ugly American&#8221; tourists?  </p>
<p>With Mexico&rsquo;s current desperate situation, which would have already resulted in a revolution if not for mass immigration to the USA, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s proper for Americans to vacation there and act like elitist fools.  Even if they weren&rsquo;t so desperate, this is not a good thing to do anyway.  Evidently, this admonition is being heeded.  </p>
<p>I expound a little more at:</p>

			<p>Having to share a common border with Mexico is punishment for something. Whatever it is, I&rsquo;m truly sorry  - now, can we build the fence, deport the illegals* here and forget there is a violent and corrupt country to our south?</p>
<p>* Don&rsquo;t say we can&rsquo;t deport them - Mexico did!</p>

<p>I highly doubt you are going to be open to hearing the truth - but here goes&hellip; the truth is that Americans (and just about everyone else) go there for one reason, and one reason, only.  To screw Mexican women, who occupy a relationship niche between whore and girlfriend. You give them money and things, and they have sex with you. and act as your girlfriend, until it&rsquo;s time to go home.</p>
<p>Those women aren&rsquo;t around anymore, because they are being raped by the Mexican criminals, on the beach.  No women?  No reason for American tourists.</p>
<p>Straight up.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;Average Mexicans&#8221; - If anyone dares to cause trouble, the authorities drag them someplace, and put a bullet in their head.<br>

<p>We used to go to Rosarito Beach and &#8220;Lobster Town&#8221; all the time but then the cops (little brown men with big guns) started stopping us&hellip;  They never shook us down, but they sure did make us feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s been seven years since our last visit to Mexico; and of course, we&rsquo;ll never go again!</p>
<p>Why the heck should we spend one single dime visiting Mexico when we&rsquo;re already paying tens of billions of tax dollars a year to &#8220;visiting Mexicans&#8221; up here?</p>
<p>I hope they continue to suffer along the Baja Coast&hellip; </p>

			<p>Read what the US State Dept. has to say about travel to Mexico:</p>
<p> <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_970.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_970.html</a><br>
 </p>
<p><br>
If you visit Mexico you stand a very high chance of being raped, robbed, having your credit cards stolen, and being beaten BY THE LOCAL POLICE.  Then you have to watch out for the criminals and drug dealers.  Not to mention the various diseases caused by poor sanitation etc.</p>
<p>I love to travel, but I will never go to Mexico again.</p>
<p>BOYCOTT MEXICO.</p>

			<p>St. Louis CofCC Blogmeister,</p>
<p>That is the stupidest thing I hear from time to time.  It&rsquo;s now our fault?  They don&rsquo;t want tourists now?  You say they don&rsquo;t receive a peso from the tourist industry but what benefit do we get from their people?  According to your idea, we should outlaw Americans from visiting Mexico and stop illegal immigration into this country.  Sounds good to me.  Let them fight their own revolutions.  </p>
<p>Btw, I know people who were shaken down by their corrupt police in Baja. They are giving out tickets to foreigners that would be the equivalent of a month&rsquo;s salary down there.  It IS getting bad. </p>

			<p>If we can just get the border fence built states can themselves enact legislation that will eliminate employment opportunities to the illegals.  </p>
<p>They will self-deport.</p>

			<p>Mexico has forever been a corrupt and crime ridden country sometimes w/criminals actually running the government. crime in Mexico is not a new thing, the criminals are just going where the money is. There are fairly safe resorts there who have their own security forces, but if you venture into public areas you are difinitely at risk.</p>

			<p>There IS a bright side to this news article. Namely, that more and more Americans are getting smart enough to BOYCOTT Mexico&rsquo;s resorts. Sure, most resort hotels are probably owned by American corporate interests, but at least they employ Mexican labor   &mdash;   so let the damned Mexican criminals in the police and government agencies feel the pinch.</p>
<p>By all means, SPREAD THE WORD about Mexican crime and corruption. Every time you hear an aquaintance is considering vacationing in at the Mexican resorts. If the owners of those ritzy hotels and resorts feel the pinch, maybe, just maybe, they&rsquo;ll turn some heat up on our Congressional whores. Sort of a &#8220;trickle-down effect,&#8221; if you get my drift. </p>
<p>Speaking of boycotts, please boycott Mexican restaurants and be sure to avoid the Mexican slop wagon and pushcart vendors infesting our cities   &mdash;   like the plague. That is, unless you LOVE the idea of being infected by those loathsome diseases and parasites the Mexican parasites (pun intended) bring in their bodies. Remember those recent stories about Mexicans passing on THEIR diseases and parasites?</p>
<p>Given the reality so many restaurants use cheap [illegal] immigrant labor, you&rsquo;d be doing your health AND your wallet a big favor by eating out less. Particularly avoiding those infamous fast-food franchises like Slop-in-the-Box, McVomit and Burger Barf. Those franchises thrive on using illegal immigrant labor and eating there you sure as hell will put yourself at risk   &mdash;   given the indifference of Mexicans to cleanliness and sanitation. Also good points to mention to co-workers, friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>Hey, I concede it will take time&hellip; but the MORE we hurt businesses employing illegals, the more likely business owners will eventually feel the pinch and let the Congressional traitors hear THEIR anger. We are not totally powerless, as Americans.</p>

			<p>I guess morals and the right thing to do, just aren&rsquo;t enough to prevent Mexicans who receive no benefit from tourista money from committing crimes.  That is the conclusion I draw from what St. Louis C of CC Blogmeister had to say.  There&rsquo;s no reason to be moral if you ain&rsquo;t getting the goodies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no benefit and lots of problems for most Americans from the Mexican illegals, according to the logic presented, it should be open season.  It&rsquo;s not through.  25% of Los Angeles county&rsquo;s welfare goes to illegal aliens, according to one of the supervisors.  <br>
<a href="http://mayorsam2.blogspot.com/2008/01/cost-of-welfare-for-illegal-aliens.html" rel="nofollow">http://mayorsam2.blogspot.com/2008/01/cost-of-welfare-for-illegal-aliens.html</a><br>
We educate, feed, clothe, house, and generally treat with respect, the criminal element (illegal aliens are criminals-6 months in jail plus a fine is the punishment on the books for even first time offenders) but somehow it&rsquo;s all our fault they rape, rob, and murder us.  Gosh, why do so many of these morally superior beings keep coming here, to be with us racist pigs? (sarcasm)</p>

			<p>I believe the assaults are being sanctioned by the Mexican Gov&rsquo;t and the Mexican people who are starting to worry about the foreign invasion into their own country.  While they yell and scream for their right to come here illegally, they are creating fear and intimidation for &#8220;tourists&#8221; who go there.  This method does work though and should be a lession for us.   </p>

<p>I agree. We, your fellow Americans, need your tourist dollars and will treat you with the respect and kindness you deserve. Come to Pennslyvania! Just stay out of Philadelphia,or at least be very careful.It&rsquo;s urban chic is way overrated, IMO. A very dangerous city, too.  And don&rsquo;t forget about New England, which was once, before all this international travel, known for its wonderful beaches. They&rsquo;re still wonderful!! Lots of historical sites in both places! And handcrafters and B &amp; B owners will welcome you!</p>

<p>When I was in Peru on business in the nineties the locals told me that if they were in their cars and were stopped by the police, they would roll down the window just an inch or so, just enough to be able to put their driver&rsquo;s licence through the space. Otherwise, they risked the cop pulling a gun on them and robbing them. They said it happened all the time. <br>

			<p>&#8220;Some American tourists in Mexico bring some of the hate and violence directed against them by Mexicans on themselves. Some American tourists in Mexico bring some of the hate and violence directed against them by Mexicans on themselves.After all, let&rsquo;s say you were a financially indignant Mexican living inland in any given tourist trap Mexican beach town, such as Acapulco. Let&rsquo;s say that, a couple of times a year, young white Americans come down to your country, your city, your beaches, to swill, screw, glutton, and chug beer. In spite of the economic benefit from such tourists, average Mexicans don&rsquo;t see a peso of it. So what incentive would you have not to commit or condone acts of violence against the &ldquo;Ugly American&rdquo; tourists? &#8220;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t disagree more. Yes, on occasion tourists can be rude, obnoxious or disorderly. Disorderly drunkeness is common during spring break.  If tourists behave in this manner, the Mexicans have the right to either be rude or obnoxious back to the tourist or arrest them for disorderly conduct, fine them or kick them out of the country. They do not have the right to condone or commit crime or violence against people. As far as &#8220;ugly americans&#8221;, they pale in comparison to the &#8220;ugly mexicans.&#8221; &#8220;Ugly americans&#8221; only get obnoxious and drunk while &#8220;ugly Mexicans&#8221; invade the USA in the millions, steal jobs, commit crime such as theft,rape and murder as well as drain are welfare. If being ugly invites violence, by your logic americans would have the right to shoot mexicans on site.LOL</p>

			<p>We have several Mexican co-workers. One of them went to one of the resorts a year ago. While on the beach, his hotel room got RANSACKED and he lost money, clothes and a laptop computer. (Probably poetic justice, in HIS case.)</p>
<p>Any American who goes to Mexico or any of the banana republics for a vacation iS ASKING to be robbed. In Mexo, wave enough money and you can buy anyone   &mdash;   from a policeman to president. Go figure! Visit Beautiful Mexico&hellip; CRIME CAPITAL OF THE WESTERN WORLD!</p>
