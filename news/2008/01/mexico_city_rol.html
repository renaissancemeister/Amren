						<p>Groping and verbal harassment is an exasperating reality for women using public transportation in this sprawling capital, where 22 million passengers cram onto subways and buses each day. Some men treat women so badly that the subway system has long had ladies-only cars during rush hour, with police segregating the sexes on the platforms.</p>
<p>But that hasn&rsquo;t helped women forced to rely on packed buses, by far the city&rsquo;s most-used form of public transportation &mdash; until this week.</p>
<p>Acting on complaints from women&rsquo;s groups, the city rolled out &#8220;ladies only&#8221; buses, complete with pink signs in the windshields to wave off the men.</p>
<p>As word spreads about the buses, the women seem delighted, while some men forced to wait a few minutes longer have shown their anger. Still others have stumbled on board despite the signs, much to their embarrassment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico City&rsquo;s female-only buses run along three busy routes throughout the day for now, but the city plans to add them to 15 other routes by April, said Ariadna Montiel, who directs the public bus system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women were asking for this service because of the sexual harassment, especially groping and leering,&#8221; Montiel said.</p>
<p>And while some men have complained that they have to wait longer for a bus, she said the women are thrilled: &#8220;The women are really happy and we have been getting a lot of e-mail and letters from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Women-only buses or subways have been rolling for years in India, Brazil, Japan and other countries. Mexico City finally took the action as part of a growing responsiveness to complaints about discrimination against women, Montiel said.</p>

			<p>And this is the kind of society our &#8220;leaders&#8221; (many of who are stark raving mad femi-nazis) would put on an equal footing with the US and Canada in terms of trade, migration, regional integration, and &#8220;security&#8221;.  Unbelievable.  Turkey&rsquo;s treatment of women by way of analogy as a candidate for the EU would be comparatively far more compatible with say Norway&rsquo;s treatment of women than what Mexico would be when examined under the same light beside the US and Canada.</p>

			<p>If any of you have any doubts about what fine gentlemanly people Mexican illegals are&hellip; this little story should serve as an eye opener. But here in Houston, being &#8220;blessed&#8221; with a very large Hispanic population, stories of rape, incest, child abuse   &mdash;   by Latinos are far from uncommon. Rape, to a Mexican is about as horrific a crime as double-parking. Go figure!</p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t Jared Taylor&rsquo;s favorite country Japan have this SAME problem also.</p>
<p>&#8220;Japan also has its own peculiar problems probably found nowhere else. Japanese have long had what seem to Westerners a juvenile attitudes towards sex. Many men, for example, like to grope women on crowded trains and subways. The problem is so bad that on some notorious lines there are separate cars for women at rush hour.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The horror. I&rsquo;d not heard of this in ANY major news outlet&hellip;shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, really.</p>
<p>So much for the &#8216;honest&rsquo; people who &#8216;just want to make a better life for themselves&rsquo;. This is a poignant insight into what Mexicans *really* act like when they aren&rsquo;t on their best behavior to sob for newscrews and march in public!</p>

			<p>To 8:59 Poster; RE: Jared Taylor&rsquo;s favored Japanese society.</p>
<p>To be sure there can be many legitimate cultural criticisms leveled at any society regarding treatment of the more vulnerable members of same society.  I am reasonably conversant with aspects related to &#8220;Geisha&#8221; culture, workaholism, &#8220;organizational honor&#8221;, chain smoking, and Sino machismo.  And there may very well be some sexual harrassment problems on Japanese metro public transit systems as there are also on US public transit systems, but don&rsquo;t think for one minute that they remotely approach the level described in this Mexico City article.  In any event, when a place is overpopulated (Mexico City, NYC, and Tokyo) stuff happens in anthill public transit systems. I can also comment as an aside, that the best time and place for a sporting man to be in a Caberet Club in the US is when a sizable group of Japanese businessmen are out for a night on the town.  Gringos do not have to put any bills in any stripper&rsquo;s garter belt when this scenario is going on.</p>
<p>As to the segregationist measures undertaken by the Mexico City transit authorities, if only God would permit (without Supreme Court intervention) that the same measures be undertaken in US public transit systems on a racial basis!!</p>

			<p>Why do some people continue to point out things that happen elsewhere also, that happen in Mexico. Those places are not on our border. Millions of folks are not coming here from those other cultures. Americans will never solve anything, when we continue to intellectualize every problem. Action is the American way, and precious little has been taken against a massive invasion of foreign nationals to this nation who are then used in a threatening way by the racist RAZA groups, whos only intention is to take power and self determinatioin away from Americans in their own nation. Anyway, that is how I see it. </p>

			<p>I guess this treatment of woman by the &#8220;macho&#8221; Mexican male is just another example of our President&rsquo;s &#8220;family values&#8221; that he thinks the people of Mexico possess. Wake up, Mr. President, most of these people are criminals. They are born into a criminal culture and it&rsquo;s a way of life. And you want to bring it here!</p>

			<p> Drive around any large suburban area in the rich part of town and look at the walls around the homes. Armed guards at the gate and unbelievably sophisticated surveillance equipment, sensors and a whole host of other items to insure thier security. These are the people that push for ever more unchecked illegal immigration. The reason; unlimited amounts of willing, docile slave labor.<br>
 They are totally apathetic to the disease, crime,and tax burdens put on those people who live (according to them) in diarrhea land.<br>
 The politicians only listen to the people with money.If 10,000,000 people marched on Washington demanding a the end of illegal immigration and a member of the illuminata called the President and told him to kill all of them; the bombs and artillery would be falling in a matter of minutes. No questions asked, no reprisals, no impeachment, and with thier full backing and guarantees of safety for the remainder of his or her life.</p>

			<p>Again, I blame white racism and the legacy of slavery for this. Had we white men not mistreated the native Mexicans when we first arrived here, and enslaved them, there would be no need for &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; buses.</p>
<p>When will the Mexican homosexual population get their own buses? And the cross-dressers? The metro-mexicans? Can&rsquo;t leave them out.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Women-only buses or subways have been rolling for years in India, Brazil, Japan and other countries. Mexico City finally took the action as part of a growing responsiveness to complaints about discrimination against women, Montiel said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Women only buses?&#8221;  Let&rsquo;s see if I have this straight:  Women want to go into the military and bunk and train with men; they want to work on the police force with men, even going so far in some cases declaring that they should be allowed in men&rsquo;s locker rooms if it&rsquo;s for the purpose of interviewing sports figures.  Some even want to go to the same restrooms as men at the same time.  </p>
<p>But they need separate buses?</p>
<p>Years ago they started these, &#8220;Stop violence against women&#8221; marches.  And at the same time were complaining because they were denied combat roles in the military, making their two expressed wishes something like, &#8220;STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN SO THEY CAN GO TO COMBAT!&#8221;  A reflection of the insanity that is political correctness today.</p>
<p>Will the absurdities never end?  I&rsquo;m all for treating women with deference if they submerge the radical feminist elements who are not just dopey they&rsquo;re insane.  Fortunately conservative women seem to be pretty level-headed and reject such nonsense.</p>
<p>And so far as female liberals?  I think male and female liberals are all the same, and the only way you can tell them apart is by the clothes they wear.</p>
<p>As the joke goes:  &#8220;Hear that Clinton is going to divorce Hillary?&#8221;  </p>
<p>No&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Why?</p>
<p>&#8220;She keeps leaving the seat up.&#8221;</p>

  &mdash;  -<br>
This IS the point to the article. The Mexicans behave so badly in Mexico, why would we want to allow more of their kind to immigrate to the USA?</p>
<p>PS- Yes, millions of folks ARE coming here from those other cultures. How do you think we got the 12 million illegals here in the first place? (actually, there are 22 million).</p>

			<p>Yes, exactly why would we want millions more of these misogynistic goofballs when we could import millions of oppressed white South Africans and Zimbabweans instead?</p>
<p>Our fellow white people are being murdered and raped in huge numbers in Africa, and the liberals in this country want us to care more about&hellip; Mexicans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>

			<p>The only purpose of communist engineered feminism in America was to destroy white male patriarchy so that non-whites could invade our borders, institutions and gene pool unimpeded.</p>
<p>That, and decreasing the number of &#8220;white devils&#8221; on the planet, by funnelling white women out of the home and into male insitutions and careers, so they&rsquo;d stop having babies, effectively destroying our demographic and political power.</p>
