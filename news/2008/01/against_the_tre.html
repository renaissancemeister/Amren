						<p>Bucking the trend in many other wealthy industrialized nations, the United States seems to be experiencing a baby boomlet, reporting the largest number of children born in 45 years.</p>
<p>The nearly 4.3 million births in 2006 were mostly due to a bigger population, especially a growing number of Hispanics. That group accounted for nearly one-quarter of all U.S. births. But non-Hispanic white women and other racial and ethnic groups were having more babies, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Experts believe there is a mix of reasons: a decline in contraceptive use, a drop in access to abortion, poor education and poverty.</p>
<p>There are cultural reasons as well. Hispanics as a group have higher fertility rates &mdash; about 40 percent higher than the U.S. overall. And experts say Americans, especially those in middle America, view children more favorably than people in many other Westernized countries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To many economists and policymakers, the increase in births is good news. The U.S. fertility rate &mdash; the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime &mdash; reached 2.1. That&rsquo;s the &#8220;magic number&#8221; required for a population to replace itself.</p>
<p>Countries with much lower rates &mdash; such as Japan and Italy, both with a rate of 1.3 &mdash; face future labor shortages and eroding tax bases as they fail to reproduce enough to take care of their aging elders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 2006 fertility rate of 2.1 children is the highest level since To be sure, the fertility rate among Hispanics &mdash; 3 children per woman &mdash; has been a major contributor. That&rsquo;s the highest rate for any group. In 2006, for the first time, Hispanics accounted for more than 1 million births.</p>
<p>The high rate probably reflects cultural attitudes toward childbirth developed in other countries, experts said. Fertility rates average 2.7 in Central America and 2.4 in South America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some complain that many illegal immigrants come here purposely to have children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fertility rates were also relatively high for other racial and ethnic groups. The rate rose to 2.1 for blacks and nearly 1.9 for non-Hispanic whites in 2006, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>Fertility levels tend to decline as women become better educated and gain career opportunities, and as they postpone childbirth until they are older. Experts say those factors, along with the legalization of abortion and the expansion of contraception options, explain why the U.S. fertility rate dropped to its lowest point &mdash; about 1.7 &mdash; in 1976.</p>
<p>But while fertility declines persisted in many other developed nations, the United States saw the reverse: The fertility rate climbed to 2 in 1989 and has hovered around that mark since then, according to federal birth data.</p>
<p>Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania sociology professor, and others say the difference has more to do with culture than race. For example, white American women have more children than white European &mdash; even though many nations in Europe have more family-friendly government policies on parental leave and child care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other factors include recent declines in contraceptive use here; limited access to abortion in some states; and a 24/7 economy that provides opportunities for mothers to return to work, he said.</p>
<p>Also, it is more common for American women to have babies out of wedlock and more common for couples here to go forward with unwanted pregnancies. And, compared with nations like Italy and Japan, it&rsquo;s more common for American husbands to help out with chores and child care.</p>
<p>There are regional variations in the United States. New England&rsquo;s fertility rates are more like Northern Europe&rsquo;s. American women in the Midwest, South and certain mountain states tend to have more children.</p>
<p>The influence of certain religions in those latter regions is an important factor, said Ron Lesthaeghe, a Belgian demographer who is a visiting professor at the University of Michigan. &#8220;Evangelical Protestantism and Mormons,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>For the &#8220;white mothers&#8221;, are they going to announce how many are having &#8220;white&#8221;, as opposed to &#8220;mixed-race&#8221; children?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that it&rsquo;s going to be &#8220;just below enough&#8221; births to end immigration to the U.S - no matter how high the birth rate is, the U.S. still needs as many foreigners as it can get.</p>
<p>Right?</p>

			<p>Yep, the least desireable have the most babies. Where are the Asians? I bet they aren&rsquo;t breeding like blacks/hispanics even when they have higher income. Jeez, why can&rsquo;t educated, healthy, and responsible people have more kids and penalize the less desireables for having more kids.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t get too enthusiastic about the White birthrate increasing.  VDARE did a story about a month ago that the increased birth rate is attributed to North Africans and Middle Easterners who are counted as White by the Census. </p>

			<p>&#8220;a drop in access to abortion&#8221;</p>
<p>SO it seems that the so-called &#8220;pro-life&#8221; position is actually increasing the Hispanic portion of the population pie; ain&rsquo;t it great???</p>

<p>The high birth rate among low end Hispanics means greater numbers of gang members, higher crime rates, plus a generally worse society than we have right now.  These are additions to the population that are harmful.</p>
<p>If the birth rate among whites reached 3 per couple, as with Hispanics, we would see a tremendous increase in the white population. But if the trend continued at an average of just 2.5, this country would still be adding people to the population in larger numbers than either Hispanics or blacks, since whites are still the most numerous race here.  </p>
<p>All we&rsquo;ve been hearing up to now from the radical left is how the white birth rate will mean that our race will die out in a few decades.  It would be a laugh at the expense of the loonies if their slanted propaganda turned against them, and the white birth rate steadily increased.<br>

			<p>&#8221;..Experts believe there is a mix of reasons (for the baby boomlet):&hellip;.poor education and poverty&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221;..To many economists and policymakers, the increase in births is good news&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>An increase in population of the impoverished and poorly educated is &#8216;good news&rsquo;?  &mdash;  I&rsquo;d like those economists to explain clearly how a growth in the entitlement-draining, school-destroying, un-educable, non-tax base segment of the population is &#8216;good news&rsquo; to anyone except those who welcome the destruction of the US economy  &mdash;  specifically the destruction of the White population. </p>
<p>Do the economists and policymakers REALLY believe that this non-(anti-) White population will support elderly Whites in their retirement? As Pinchegabacho and other Californians have posted, many in this population and their race-based organizations HATE Whites and gleefully, openly call for their ethnic cleansing(they&rsquo;ve already started on the blacks).</p>
<p>This miserable population is coming your way soon, ready to destroy your state as they&rsquo;ve destroyed California, and will bring gangs, crime, social service demands and other third world miseries with them as they expand and metastasize.  Our friends in Canada are already getting a taste of this parasitic host-destroying population group. </p>
<p>From the article: </p>
<p>&#8221;..Hispanics as a group have higher fertility rates &mdash; about 40 percent higher than the U.S. overall&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The expansion of this population is nothing but bad news for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Hispanics commit violent crimes at roughly three times the white rate.</p>
<p>Hispanics are 19 times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs.</p>
<p>Hispanics are also more likely than whites to drive drunk. </p>
<p>Hispanic babies are twice as likely as white babies to be born with fetal alcohol syndrome, which leaves them disfigured and mentally retarded. </p>
<p>Hispanics are even less likely than blacks to finish high school. The billions America has poured into bilingual education and other programs to boost Hispanic performance and keep them in school is not working</p>
<p>Hispanic&hellip;jobless rate is nearly double that of whites&hellip;Hispanics (are) more likely than whites to be on welfare.</p>

<p>There is no silver lining here. America is already greatly overpopulated and this will only increase in the future. The population, even without the illegals is about 300 million.<br>
In 20 years that could easily swell to 400 million, with a billion people very possible by centuries end just 92 years from now&hellip;</p>

			<p> I predicted several months ago on Amren that the low birthrate should right itself if left alone .The biggest problem is that for the last fifty years one group has been paid to proliferate while young whites do not have to have but one or two children before they figure out there is no way under the sun they can continue to afford it . We should continue to pray and hope that the low birthrate in Europe will right itself also .   </p>

			<p>The big un-researched contributor to increases in the white birth rate is disaster, either natural or war. After 9-11 there were stories of couples getting back together who hadn&rsquo;t been talking. The women&rsquo;s shelters emptied out for a short time. Also look at the white birth rate in Bosnia durning the war there in the 90&rsquo;s. Sad to say, it might take a catastrophe to get healthy male-female relationships in the U.S. again.</p>

			<p>Good news regarding population decline. A new company, Telomolecular Corporation (an American company) is developing a new anti-aging therapy that looks very promising. It&rsquo;s based on the observation that the biological clocks of cells reside in the telomeres (the ends of chromosomes): telomeres get progressively shorter, and the shorter telomeres are, the closer the cell is to aging and dying. In 1998 scientists succeeded in creating immortal (but normal, non-cancerous) cells by adding the gene for telomerase (the enzyme that elongates telomeres) to normal (aging) cells.</p>
<p>Now the next step is to do the same with whole organisms. The company controls patents for a couple of technologies that sound very promising: nanocicles, a telomere-elongating technology created at Stanford University, and a delivery technology for nanocircles and telomerase (the enzyme that elongates telomeres, a second technical possibility) called PLGA nanoparticles (from the University of Nebraska, I believe).</p>
<p>If these technologies go ahead, it will mean the demographic salvation of the West: we won&rsquo;t need to win a birth-rate race with the third-worlders (a disaster in itself, because overpopulation is no solution), we&rsquo;ll have something much better: experienced and mature persons will be able to contribute to the welfare of society much longer, leading to a greater accumulation of vital knowledge.</p>
<p>A warning, however; Telomolecular doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a very serious company. They promised, many months ago, that they would create a telomerized (with elongated telomeres) sheep called Dolly II (a reference to Dolly, the cloned sheep). It didn&rsquo;t happen. They also promised that in March 31, 2007, they would launch an anti-wrinkle cream based on their telomere-elongation technology. It didn&rsquo;t happen, too, and they promised the cream for 48 months later. These are not good omens.</p>
<p>And there is something else: they seem to be furious anti-racists, which is a very bad sign regarding their intellectual honesty. Their personnel is full of non-Whites, which seem to be hired more for their politically correct race than for their competence. Bad omen, indeed.</p>
<p>But the technologies seem to be worth a close look.<br>

			<p>Look folks the party is over. Black folks are at zero population growth with 2.1 child. I believe the numbers are spun because Blacks have the second highest rate of abortion in America, second to white people. Factor in that 66% of all women with HIV in America are Black women and you have a population that is going to die off. </p>
<p>You need to stop thinking about America in terms of &#8220;White America.&#8221; The America you knew is dead and in many ways I think it&rsquo;s for the best. Your largley white leadership has sold you out for globalization. You must accept the fact that most of America&rsquo;s white population is looked at by the financial elite as &#8220;white trash&#8221; that was dumped here to clean out European countries during the 1800s. You had your shot with the Homestead Act of the 1800s and the FHA and GI Bill programs of the 40s&rsquo; and 50s&rsquo;. </p>
<p>The world now has a well educated work force from China and India that will work better and cheaper than most Americans regardless of color. </p>
<p>I suggest you get ready for extreme poverty, high addiction rates to alcohol and METH, unstable families, white on white violence, and vice. We are entering a &#8220;New Dark Age&#8221; it is the age of Corporate Feudalism. Corporate Feudalism doesn&rsquo;t care what color you are, nor what nation you claim, its about money and control. If you have no money, you have not access, if you have no acess, you have no control. If that is the case, then you are nothing more than &#8220;white trash.&#8221; </p>
<p>But America gave you a chance to think you something more than you are. Because of that I can understand your lamenting and complaining. It was a nice ride while it lasted. But in the end, you have to look to yourself as the cause. Because even if there were no people of color in America to scapegoat, I&rsquo;d bet you&rsquo;d still end up with the same current situation. Whites have to address their own class structure of white trash, rednecks (I actually like rednecks), middle class, upper class, and the financial elite. <br>

			<p>  I am one of many who know the solution to this problem-just simply have more children, raise them correctly to your ethics and morals, and either attempt to send them a private school, home school, or being intimately involved with their public schooling experience is simply enough yet never simple.</p>

Americans are White. There is no other kind of American.<br>
If America ceases to be White, then America ceases to exist&hellip;</p>
<p>Non-Whites have never demonstrated the ability to develop, let alone sustain, an advanced Civilization. An Advanced Civilization being -as it has been for the past three thousand years- the exclusive domain of European peoples.<br>
 As Whites become more disillusioned with the course their society has taken for the past 50 years, they will -after enduring a long list of grievances- at long last stand up, and rectify the situation&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of &#8220;how long&#8221; we are willing to let Civilization spiral out of control&hellip;<br>

			<p>1.9 for whites still means a declining population of whites&hellip; and certainly OJ&rsquo;s children are counted as &#8220;white.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am reminded of a trip to Japan where one of my business associates bemoaned that the current birth rate would result in a population of 1 person in Japan in the year 3000.  They would truly accept this fate for their country before allowing the tragedy that has happened in the United States.</p>
