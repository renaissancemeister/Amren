						<p>Milton Blahyi, a former feared rebel commander in Liberia&rsquo;s brutal civil war, has admitted to taking part in human sacrifices as part of traditional ceremonies intended to ensure victory in battle.</p>
<p>He said the sacrifices &#8220;included the killing of an innocent child and plucking out the heart, which was divided into pieces for us to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>There had been numerous rumours of human sacrifices during the 1979-93 conflict but this is the first time anyone has admitted publicly to the practice.</p>
<p>Mr Blahyi, 37, is better known in Liberia as &#8220;General Butt Naked&#8221; because he went into combat with no clothes on, to scare the enemy.</p>
<p>He is now an Evangelist preacher, who prefers to use the name Joshua.</p>
<p>He was speaking to the BBC, after telling Liberia&rsquo;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) that his forces had killed 20,000 people.</p>
<p><b>Forgiveness</b></p>
<p>Mr Blahyi said he had first become exposed to killings in 1982 when, at the age of 11, he was ordained &#8220;the traditional priest of my tribe.&#8221;</p>
<p>He explained that when a rebellion broke out against President Samuel Doe, he had to go to war on behalf of the president, as they were from the same Krahn ethnic group.</p>
<p>Forum for the Establishment of a War Crimes Court</p>
<p>He fought against the militia of Charles Taylor, currently on trial for war crimes in The Hague.</p>
<p>As the traditional priest, he says he persuaded the &#8220;hesitant&#8221; political leaders of his faction to make a human sacrifice before going into battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;They asked me to do it in secret; but some of the sacrifices are supposed to be as a ceremony; so my boys and I made some of the sacrifices in the open.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Blahyi did not say where they had found the children to be killed.</p>
<p>He said he thought that confessing to what he had done and asking for forgiveness could help heal the country&rsquo;s wounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been looking for an opportunity to tell the true story about my life; and every time I tell people my story, I feel relieved,&#8221; he said, drinking a bottle of tomato juice in the capital, Monrovia.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Ashamed&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Mr Blahyi stopped fighting in 1996, saying God appeared to him as he was charging naked into battle and told him he was doing Satan&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>He is now often seen preaching on street corners and churches in Monrovia.</p>
<p>&#8220;I now preach against murder and making human sacrifices,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people see me and congratulate me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Others see me and say I should not be walking down the streets of Monrovia posing proud. But I continue to tell such people I am not proud, I am ashamed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Between the time he was ordained a &#8220;traditional priest&#8221; and the time he stopped fighting, he said, &#8220;more than 20,000 people fell victim &mdash; they were killed.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Warlord</b></p>
<p>Liberia&rsquo;s TRC, modelled on South Africa&rsquo;s post-apartheid commission, began hearings earlier this month.</p>
<p>Some Liberians, however, say their body is too weak and argue that a war crimes court should be established &mdash; Mr Taylor is being accused by a court set up to investigate the conflict in neighbouring Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have an individual admitting that he and his group killed over 20,000 people, certainly there should be a mechanism put in place for such people to face justice,&#8221; said Mulbah Morlue, who heads the Forum for the Establishment of a War Crimes Court in Liberia.</p>
<p>The war is now over but some 15,000 UN peacekeepers remain in the country.</p>
<p>While asking for forgiveness, Mr Blahyi says he&rsquo;s ready for whatever the TRC decides to do to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could be electrocuted, I could be hanged,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I think forgiveness and reconciliation is the right way to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also urged other former fighters to confess their doings because &#8220;wherever they go there is a stigma on them&#8221;.</p>
<p>But another former warlord, Prince Johnson, says he will not appear before the commission unless he is compelled to do so.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson, now a senator, led the forces who tortured and killed then President Doe in 1990. The video of this brutal killing is still on sale in Liberia.</p>
<p>He says that he has already made his peace with the Doe family but would testify at the TRC if they lodged a formal complaint.</p>
