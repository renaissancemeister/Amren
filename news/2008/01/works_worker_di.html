						<p>For <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Avdare.com+%20VDAWDI">several years</a> we have tracked a destructive, albeit seemingly inevitable, trend: the  displacement of native workers by immigrants. The government&rsquo;s employment figures tell the story. Since the start of the Bush Administration (January 2001) through December 2007,</p>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="50%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="baseline" width="42" align="left"><big><b>&#149;</b></big>
    </td>
    <td width="100%" align="left">National employment rose by 8.433 million (+6.1 percent)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="baseline" width="42" align="left"><big><b>&#149;</b></big>
    </td>
    <td width="100%" align="left">
Hispanic employment rose by 4.4 million (+27.3 percent)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="baseline" width="42" align="left"><big><b>&#149;</b></big>
    </td>
    <td width="100%" align="left">Non-Hispanic employment rose by 4.0 million (+3.3 percent)
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Bottom line: Over the past seven years Hispanic employment (the best available proxy for immigrant workers ) grew more than 8 times faster than native (non-Hispanic) employment.</p>
<p>Since late summer, however, the roles have been reversed. From August through December 2007 Hispanics either gained jobs at lower rates, or lost jobs at greater rates, than non-Hispanics. Over this period,</p>

<p>The past four months marked the longest stretch of declining  native displacement in seven years &mdash; as seen in our VDAWDI graphic:</p>
<div class="text-center">
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><a href="/news/2008/01/15/displacement-large.gif" target="displacement-large"><img src="/news/2008/01/15/displacement.gif" alt="displacement"></a><br>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Obviously, four months do not (necessarily) a trend make. The sharp contraction in residential construction, a sector notoriously dependent on illegal alien workers, undoubtedly played a role. A housing recovery could send VDAWDI back to record levels.</p>
<p>But 2007 was also a year in which the federal government ramped up enforcement efforts. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made 4,940 workplace arrests [Worksite Enforcement fact sheet, ICE] last year, a 13 percent increase from 2006. (In 2002 only 510 such arrests were made.)</p>
<p>Although fewer than 100 of the arrestees were employers, ICE obtained more than $30&nbsp;million in fines, restitutions, and civil judgments against them in just the first three quarters of FY2007. (In FY2005 these fines totaled a laughable $6,500.)</p>
<p>Equally relevant, ICE <b>&ldquo;fugitive operations teams&rdquo;</b> arrested 30,408 criminal aliens in fiscal 2007. That&rsquo;s nearly double the 15,462 arrests made in 2006, and a whopping 15 times the 1,901 arrested in 2003.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get carried away. There may be 10 to 15 million illegals working in the U.S. At 50,000 removals per year it would take a century to reach half of the current alien work force.</p>
<p>Employer sanctions offer a far more efficient way to resolve the problem, by switching off the jobs magnet.</p>
<p>The 1986 Immigration Act promised heavy fines on employers who <b>&ldquo;knowingly hire&rdquo;</b> illegal aliens &mdash; but provided no easy way for them to verify the authenticity of documents presented by illegals.</p>
<p>However, twenty years have passed. The technology to verify work papers instantaneously is available and is already used by a few employers. Unfortunately, it is voluntary &mdash; except in <a href="https://newsok.com/article/3189130/1199513942">Arizona.</a></p>
<p>But the word is out. Employers read stories of companies who have lost their entire workforce and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. [<i><a href="https://newsok.com/article/3189130/1199513942">NewsOK: Employers may pay price for not embracing changes</a></i>] Illegal workers are increasingly anxious: More than half of Hispanic adults in the U.S. fear that they or someone they know could face deportation.</p>
<p>Perception is everything. ICE may have deliberately created a false sense of strict enforcement. This Potemkin Village can produce significant levels of voluntary deportation &mdash; at least initially.

<p>Are the past four months the start of a longer-term trend?</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

			<p>A housing recovery could send VDAWDI back to record levels.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t count on it.  Reckoning day has arrived for our Leviathan&rsquo;s unsustainable debt, and there will be NO housing recovery.  The coming economic depression, as bad as it will be, may actually be just what the American people need to shake them out of their stupor, get them off them public trough themselves (54% of americans receive some form of government subsistance), and rid ourselves of our massive illegal immigrant population.  </p>
<p>When one considers what our elites have done through NAFTA, the WTO, and the other phony free-trade agreements to plunder the wealth of this once mighty nation combined with the treachery of insourcing 1.75 million foreigners every year, the degree of treason to this country is unfathomable.  Oh, but our plutocrats continue to live extremely well, and their wealth upon reaching our Congress appears to be limitless.  There was a story today on Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s latest contribution to our reeling nation&rsquo;s economic plight of how she managed (despite gridlock) to get the Senate&rsquo;s cafeteria upgraded to serve haute cuisine (oh dear, how was this unspeakable horror overlooked for so long) fare.</p>
<p>I hope everyone will take the time to read one of the most important stories on the web today regarding taking a closer look at who&rsquo;s running for our Presidency (replete with photos of their residences), and how even those who start out in politics (like the Clintons) with even nothing and never having worked a real job their ENTIRE lives wind up as multi-millionaires.  Also worthy of mentioning was yesterday an article posted on Worldnetdaily regarding 10,000 people lined up for 300 job openings for positions at a new WALMART.  Please see the following link and email it to everyone you know:</p>

			<p>Those figures represent a dubious value at best. Firstly, they supposedly originate from the federal government. A government, it might be remembered, FALSELY LISTS Hispanic criminals as Whites or Caucasian. Furthermore, the percentages given, Hispanic employment FALLING by -0.3% while non-Hispanic employment GAINED +0.4% is hardly worth crowing over.</p>
<p>Reading this article smacks too much of the Washingtonian spin-meisters at work&hellip; trying to soothe and placate the White American Voters.</p>

			<p>There are other backlash factors as well - I own a construction and handyman service in the south.<br>
The amount of houses built in the last 2-4 years has rapidly become my bread and butter. I have observed that sub-standard building practices seem to be the standard in most cases. <br>
I attribute this to the skills and abilities of our &#8220;friends and neighbors&#8221; from south of the border, where a rusty coca-cola sign to patch a wall is the epitome of craftsmanship. <br>
They just don&rsquo;t get it, and I even have seen one hombre get annoyed and argue(and subsequently fired)when the site super told him he was doing a job wrong, and forced him correct it.<br>
Hopefully, housing contractors have learned that &#8220;cheap labor&#8221; can be real expensive.</p>

			<p>The traitors in the Whitehouse, courts and congress have devastated this nation&rsquo;s economy more thoroughly through their corruption and abuse of power than any foreign army could have done through military action alone.  Civilian tribunals convened to place these traitors on trial prior to their imprisonment or executions will soon become the order of the day&hellip;    </p>

			<p>Real inflation is now running at 11%(g. beck 1/15).  I wonder how much gas prices and food prices have gone up due to criminal migrants?</p>

			<p>In case any of you missed it&hellip; Last October 15th, Hershey Chocolate Company, headquartered in Lancaster, PA, announced it was laying off thousands of workers and moving its candy production TO MEXICO! (Google this on the Internet, if you want.)</p>
<p>Well, you good folks just might want to consider this when you buy a candy bar or box of chocolates in the future. Mexicans are not exactly renowned for cleanliness or good sanitary habits&hellip; That brainworm parasite we heard of, for one. Also people getting sick from eating stuff from those infamous slopcart vendors and taco trucks, for another. Dirty restaurant facilities, their workers not following sanitation codes. NO, I AM NOT ACCUSING anyone of anything. But pointing out that you might want take the precaution of avoiding future purchases of Hershey products. (The risk factor.) However, food products coming from China have also had their share of adverse publicity. Maybe, just maybe, if American consumers started THINKING about where the food purchase they&rsquo;re about to make comes from&hellip; and avoid that specific selection&hellip; a message might actually sink into the heads of our greedy capitalist/corporate CEOs&hellip; if sales (and profits) start to drop&hellip; that they&rsquo;d have been better off with American production workers in American facilities and plants.</p>
<p>In other words, use your wallet (your purchasing power) to tell the profit hungry CEOs where to get off.</p>

			<p>Supply and demand have a huge influence on the price of goods and 30-40 million recently added Hispanic illegals totally distort market demand and drive prices skyward.  Foreigners also are transferring billions of dollars out of this country every year and contributing to inflation.  Deport them all and watch how quickly prices drop and the value of our dollar escalate&hellip; </p>

<p>Well, they already shut down the Brachs Candy factory down in Chicago in favor of one in Mexico. And they just destroyed one of the buildings last year for the new Batman movie, &#8220;The Dark Knight.&#8221;</p>

<p>I would think the gas price rise is due to the stock market (options buyers). Yes, I despise immigrants as much as anyone on this site. But will NOT falsely blame them for what they are not deserving blame for.</p>
