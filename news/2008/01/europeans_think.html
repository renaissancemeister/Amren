						<p>AN &#8220;overwhelming majority&#8221; of Europeans believe immigration from Islamic countries is a threat to their traditional way of life, a survey revealed last night.</p>
<p>The poll, carried out across 21 countries, found &#8220;widespread anti-immigration sentiment&#8221;, but warned Europe&rsquo;s Muslim population will treble in the next 17 years.</p>
<p>It reported &#8220;a severe deficit of trust is found between the Western and Muslim communities&#8221;, with most people wanting less interaction with the Muslim world.</p>
<p>Last night an MP warned it showed that political leaders in Britain who preach the benefits of unlimited immigration were dangerously out of touch with the public.</p>
<p>The study, whose authors include the former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey, was commissioned for leaders at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>It reports &#8220;a growing fear among Europeans of a perceived Islamic threat to their cultural identities, driven in part by immigration from predominantly Muslim nations&#8221;.</p>
<p>And it concludes: &#8220;An overwhelming majority of the surveyed populations in Europe believe greater interaction between Islam and the West is a threat.&#8221; Backbench Tory MP David Davies told the Sunday Express: &#8220;I am not surprised by these findings. People are fed up with multiculturalism and being told they have to give up their way of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people in Britain expect anyone who comes here to be willing to learn our language and fit in with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Davies, who serves on the Commons Home Affairs Committee, added: &#8220;People do get annoyed when they see millions spent on translating documents and legal aid being given to people fighting for the right to wear a head-to-toe covering at school.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people are very uncomfortable with the changes being caused by immigration and politicians have been too slow to wake up to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report says people have little enthusiasm for greater understanding with Islam and attempts to improve relations have been &#8220;disappointing&#8221;.</p>
<p>And with the EU Muslim population expected to reach 15 per cent by 2025 it predicts: &#8220;Any deterioration on the international front will be felt most severely in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>But leading Muslim academic Haleh Afshar, of York University, blamed media &#8220;hysteria&#8221; for the findings. She said: &#8220;There is an absence of trust towards Muslims, but to my mind that is very much driven by an uninformed media.</p>
<p>&#8220;To blame immigration is much harder because the current influx of immigrants from eastern Europe are by-and-large not Muslim.</p>
<p>The danger is that when people are fearful of people born and bred in this country it is likely that discrimination may follow.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;A lot of people are very uncomfortable with the changes being caused by immigration and politicians have been too slow to wake up to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is actually stated backwards! Its the PEOPLE, the electorate, who have been fatally slow in waking up to their traitorous politicians&rsquo; agenda, which is entirely inimical to their interests. The politicians know exactly what they are doing; after all, they were smart enough to get elected.</p>

			<p>If an &ldquo;overwhelming majority&rdquo; of people actually put this issue in the forefront, their leaders wouldn&rsquo;t be in office.</p>
<p>Perhaps the root of the problem can be found in the word Cult-ture,  IE: Cult. The left and middle and some on the right have been &#8216;brainwashed&rsquo; by the cult, that is only normal, culture is the national identity so that PC is normal. So when it is a perverted cult-ture, then that is what you get, a perverted (mutli-cult) world view.</p>

			<p>Correction: ALL non-white immigration, regardless of religion, nation, wealth etc is bad for Europe.</p>
<p>But hopefully it starts with the Muslims, then moves onto more non-white immigrants/descendants of immigrants.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve never known how politicans can sleep at night. Everyone, politicans included, know that multiculturalsim and diversity are creating, not solving problems. To what standards are politicans upheld? (Everyone has a different view and nothing is concrete.)It&rsquo;s obvious that a taxpaying voter&rsquo;s opinion doesn&rsquo;t matter. </p>
<p>Fundamentalist Muslims and &#8216;everyday, peace-loving&rsquo; Muslims read from the same book. They believe all knowledge is in the Quran.</p>
<p>The Quran teaches no tolerance for other religions and followers of Muhammad, God&rsquo;s apostle, are &#8216;ruthless to the unbelievers&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Nonsense. Europeans at least share a common heritage, while Muslims are wholly alien, and are pronounced much more boisterously in society.</p>
<p>&#8220;The danger is that when people are fearful of people born and bred in this country it is likely that discrimination may follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is somewhat vague, but Europeans have PLENTY of reason to be fearful and disdainful toward Muslims. Even to discriminate.</p>

			<p>Discrimination is a good thing. As is its close relative, freedom of association. I discriminate every time I choose not to drive through the &#8216;hood&rsquo; on the way to work. I discriminate every time I choose to eat healthy food instead of a bag-o-razor blades. Discrimination does follow fear&hellip;fear of making inferior choices in life. We discriminate when we choose not to allow the enemies of our lives, liberty, religion and our government institutions to immigrate. And rightly so. The People understand intuitively that discrimination is the source of a successful life. It is the politicians whose powers of discrimination are mind-bogglingly  absent.</p>
<p>The report says people have little enthusiasm for greater understanding with islam.</p>
<p>Oh, we understand it just fine. What they really intend is that we replace understanding with submission. Yep. Little enthusiasm for that foul option. Have the same demands ever been issued to the immigrants? To demonstrate a little respect, a &#8216;greater understanding&rsquo; for our Western values? Thought not. For if anyone had  bothered to ask the People first, they would never permit any immigration from islamic nations as a matter of self-defense. And self-respect. </p>

			<p>Political experts correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but I think Putin wants to hold on to the reigns of power because he realises if he doesn&rsquo;t, Russia could be taken over by neo-liberal fascists who would turn the country into a multi-cultural hell-hole.  </p>
<p>Let me illustrate the strength of multiculturalism.  There&rsquo;s a lot of political tension between the UK and Russia at the moment. Just suppose, for hypothetical purposes, that the UK and Russia went to war, and we needed to recruit conscripts. I am far from alone in my position that under no circumstances would I fight in a multiracial army against a white country.  Indeed, we will soon reach a point where many would welcome Russian invasion, if you&rsquo;re reading, Mr Putin, as perhaps the last ditch attempt to save Western Civilisation.  What may sound over the top now will be rational thinking twenty years hence.</p>

&#8220;The report says people have little enthusiasm for greater understanding with Islam and attempts to improve relations have been &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
That&rsquo;s because we are incompatible with Islam, and Islam is incompatible with us. Islam is incompatible with anything that is not Islam. Their holy book the Koran is quite explicit about this: the ONLY choices it offers non-Muslims are convert, die, or pay extortion for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>The people of EVERY WESTERN NATION who&rsquo;ve allowed Muslims in know this. It&rsquo;s only our own &#8220;leaders&#8221; who don&rsquo;t. Or who try to deny the undeniable. </p>
<p>Which is why I blame liberal whites more than I blame the immigrants. The Muslims are merely taking advantage of what&rsquo;s offered to them. They&rsquo;re just pushing their own agenda   &mdash;   like every group on earth does except white people   &mdash;   and I can&rsquo;t really blame them for that. </p>
<p>But our white liberal leaders have no such excuse. They are, in effect, playing for the opposing team   &mdash;   kicking goal after goal into our own net   &mdash;   in order to make themselves feel virtuous and clever. </p>
<p>And for this grand-scale racial betrayal they will one day be punished, and punished severely. <br>

How is it dangerous to discriminate against people that you fear?  The Moslems may have been born in Europe, but they should have been born in their Moslem homelands, where they could riot harmlessly and rob and rape one another in peace.  </p>

<p>Well to my mind it is really this kind of informative article in the Daily Express that is enlightening the people of Britain, finally; and we need more of this. Just imagine if every day for the past 10 to 15 years, every media outlet had warned about the dangers of Islam, what different countries there might be in Europe, how many people would still be alive instead of having had their lives destroyed or been murdered by Islamic thugs and terrorists. <br>
Of course this woman is going to whine and complain, it puts her and her ilk on notice that the worm is turning.</p>
<p>Newspapers and news organisations exist to sell their product, obviously this kind of article is reaching out and filling a void so they&rsquo;ll print more. I don&rsquo;t care why they do it, just as long as they do. The media have finally cottoned on and as we&rsquo;ve all noticed, there&rsquo;s an article like this coming from &#8216;respectable&rsquo; papers and journals on a weekly basis. I don&rsquo;t think this genie is going to go back into the bottle very easily. The government is going to have to act or they&rsquo;re going to take a pasting at the next election.<br>

<p>Its not immigration of white Christian Europeans that is the problem. Its Muslims - purely and simply. Take them out of Europe and most of our community tensions would disappear.</p>

<p>Posted by Eugene at 7:46 PM on January 29
<p>Eugene, you might be right here and I don&rsquo;t think it sounds over the top at all. For the vast majority of people it&rsquo;s a natural and instinctive reaction to do anything to survive, hence drowning people with fight others for the last place on the lifeboat. The hero who swims away dies. Who really knows who is doing a noble act? What guides us?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently examining my own seemingly instinctive belief that war is always bad.  I say &lsquo;seemingly&rsquo; because  I know enough to realize that 50 years of hearing  &lsquo;never again&rsquo;, make love not war&rsquo;, &lsquo;&rdquo;peace&rdquo; man&rsquo;, tolerance, passivity and peace vigils have brought us nothing but devastated nations. Where does this passivity come from? The West has always promoted Jesus of Nazareth as the pre-eminent advocate of pacifism and tolerance because he left a legacy in his native land that promoted multiculturalism.  This legacy has trickled down through the centuries, leading us to believe we must tolerate Islamic invaders and other alien cultures and races that are bent on destroying us.  Is the Marxist Far Left using our vulnerability, with regard to war and intolerance, against us? I think we need to ask difficult questions (if the PC brigade will give us permits!)</p>
<p>I truly believe it is time we all examined all our beliefs and assumptions if we want to be around in 20 years.<br>

<p>Oh, no it hasn&rsquo;t!  Not always.  Recently, absolutely; but for most of it&rsquo;s christian history, Europe had no problem raising and deploying armies &amp; navies all over the world,  resisting multiple islamic invasions, and eventually creating that empire upon which the sun never set. </p>
<p>But you are quite right in your assessment of the present: the West is under a massive assault, and if we will not realize that &amp; defend ourselves, we are in real danger. </p>

<p>&gt; I so agree!  But everthing means EVERYTHING including that pathetic myth of Christianity you mentioned.  Jesus never taught multicultualism, ROME DID.  A good objective reading of Western history is one of the first items in the order of remaking ourselves into a cultural model that can survive.</p>

			<p>All roads lead to Auschwitz and Europeans are so fearful of being labeled &#8220;racist&#8221; that they will do nothing to save themselves.  It is useless to offer them common sense at this point.  Nothing less than catastrophe will cause them to shift their itty bitty brains and reject multiculturalism.  But a cursory glance at European history reveals a whole series of catastrophes.  So be it.  Here comes another one.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Islam is becoming increasingly popular with many so called &#8220;American&#8221; Blacks. First, it gives them an opportunity to play &#8220;dress up&#8221; and secondly, it puts its Nihil Obstat on their egregious behavior. After all, don&rsquo;t Imams in the Mosques of Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Oslo declare that the indigenous women are &#8220;whores&#8221; and deserve to be brutally raped due to the manner in which they dress?<br>
Sounds like the perfect religion for sociopaths!</p>
