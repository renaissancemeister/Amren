						<p>One of the first calls Sundeep Bhatia received Monday was from the principal at Dorsey High, a few blocks from his South Los Angeles 7-Eleven store.</p>
<p>Bhatia is the store owner I wrote about Saturday after his 7-Eleven was hit by a group of rowdy kids last week on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. (See <a href="/news/2008/01/callous_disresp.html" target="sacred" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>&#8220;&lsquo;Callous Disrespect Taints a &lsquo;Sacred Day.&rsquo;&#8221;</b></a>) Bhatia was disgusted that the teenagers &mdash; most of them black &mdash; would act so disrespectfully on what he called a &#8220;sacred&#8221; day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Readers suggested the kids be publicly shamed &mdash; the video posted online, shown in school assemblies and linked to our newspaper&rsquo;s website. Bhatia said he&rsquo;s willing to make it public if he can get permission from his corporate bosses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sure someone would recognize a kid or two&#8221; if images from the video were posted at neighborhood schools and churches, a teacher from Pasadena said in an e-mail. &#8220;A few students who can&rsquo;t sit down for a week (as I would have been, had I pulled a stunt like that as a teenager) would be a good start.</p>
<p>&#8220;But from my experience,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;I can tell you what most of the parents of these teenagers would say: &lsquo;Stop picking on my baby.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>And a former high school principal suggested the young looters themselves might relish the notoriety. Students at her school used to swarm local clothing stores, she said, &#8220;and scoop up jackets, hats and anything else they can carry &hellip; then have the nerve to show up at school &hellip; wearing the items and purposely keeping the tags on so people would know they had participated.&#8221;</p>
<p>So much for putting the tape on YouTube and turning junior thieves into Internet celebrities.</p>

The problem is that these &#8220;Black&#8221; &#8220;youths&#8221; are not as stupid as those who enable their behavior believe them to be. While it is true that they seem to be incapable of scholastic achievement, they are bright at playing the system and laughing at it.</p>
<p>It is often noted by our governing rulers that requiring such miscreants to preform community service at hard labor in order to repay society for the damage they do to it puts them at physical risk and exposes the little darlings to ridicule from their fellow hoodlums. This is undoubtedly true.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it about time our corrupt political-legal system begins kicking butt so that they fear them more than they do their fellows?</p>

					<p>For many years I worked in an office located near a small family owned neighborhood <span class="caps">IGA </span>grocery store. This was not a convenience store or gas station that sold snacks, but an old style traditional grocery store that was common in the 40s and 50s. Although it was in a predominately white neighborhood, the nearby elementary and middle schools had large numbers of black &#8220;students&#8221;. </p>
<p>After school these kids would drift around the neighborhood in groups that sometimes got quite large. On occasion they would try to mob this litle grocery store, but the owners would always lock the door and admit them two at a time and follow them around the store. Of course they would curse and spit on the floor complaining about how they were being treated, but the owners would always tell them they could go somewhere else if they didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>I guess you could say those kids were being stereotyped, but hey, they were stereotypes! These groups of young thugs were constantly fighting, running through people&rsquo;s yards, cursing endlessly, and always stealing bikes and anything else not nailed down. Whenever the police would arrive, they would scatter in every direction, just like a flushed covey of birds.</p>

					<p>The only discipline that would actually work for young blacks is severe corporal punishment.  This has been known for most of history by anybody who&rsquo;s lived among them - especially blacks themselves.  Any other kind of discipline or shaming will have little or no effect.</p>
<p>Back when I was in high school (ghetto high school) they used paddling.  It worked and the man (a white man) who did the paddling actually had some respect from those kids.  Force and the threat of force is really the only thing they do respect.  Anything else is seen as weakness and is laughed off.</p>

					<p>And all this time I thought the Martin Luther King holiday was a celebration of black civil rights. Funny to find out it&rsquo;s really just about candy. Hell, we give the stuff away on Halloween. Why not just combine Martin Pinko King day with Halloween and give the little hooligans all the candy they want? Lord knows, with their baggy trousers and cockeyed hats, they&rsquo;re already dressed for it. </p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s so hard because they&rsquo;re beyond all discilpline. There is absolutely nothing that can be done to young blacks because their lives are completely empty. They can&rsquo;t be threatened or punished in any way that will make them desist. It&rsquo;s as if we&rsquo;re living with rabid animals in our midst.</p>
<p>The store manager was lucky they didn&rsquo;t kill him.</p>

					<p>Why do these kids act this way? First, they have no parents, are taught no values and given no dicipline. Their fathers are absent if they know who they are, their mothers teach no values and are probably too high on crack to care only stopping to excuse their bad behavior. Society, black leaders and marxist whites, tell them they are oppressed and all their failures are due to whitey. Voila, instant hoods.</p>

					<p>As a poster suggested yesterday, the solution is to put everything behind glass and don&rsquo;t let these creatures get their grubby hands on merchandise until they hand over the legal tender.  There&rsquo;s no reason why a store can&rsquo;t be run as &#8220;general store,&#8221; where the customer requests an item from a clerk, who then goes into a stockroom to retrieve the requested item.  </p>

					<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s why Robert S. Rodgers of Culver City believes that countless black youths will pay the price for this isolated incident of lawlessness. &#8220;The good will suffer as well as the bad&#8221;</p>
<p>This is <span class="caps">FAR </span>from an &#8220;isolated incident of lawlessness&#8221; Mr. Rodgers. This kind of thing occurs daily across the nation. This particular incident only got media coverage because it coincided with a celebration of &#8220;Saint&#8221; Martin Loser King and the store owner was also a member of the &#8220;Sainted Minority&#8221; club. Had the store owner been White, there would have been Zero coverage and the owner himself would be reviled as a racist for even reporting it to the police.<br>
No, Mr. Rodgers, as usual, there will be NO consequences of any kind for the Bad, even if caught and a mountain of concrete evidence points to their guilt (i.e. The Jena Six, <span class="caps">OJ, </span>etc&hellip;) </p>
<p>Mr. Rodgers then follows up with &#8220;The owner and his family and friends can&rsquo;t help but harbor negative thoughts about us African Americans.&#8221; </p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t the whole gist of this article supposedly to reject the notion of the &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221; mentality and stereo-typing and &#8220;group-blame&#8221;?</p>
<p>And, as always, the article ends up focusing on how racist America is and worrying about how it will effect blacks  rather than address the Actual Crimes committed by the Black Thugs themselves.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m still trying to find out how to cash in on  the &#8220;privledge&#8221; part of my &#8220;White Skin Privledge&#8221;.</p>

					<p>Primitive people need primitive justice.  Jail Mammy when her baby steals something.  Watch her yank that grill out of baby&rsquo;s mouth with a pair of pliers when she finishes her 30 days of gathering trash along the highway.  Young Darfur will think before he enters a store again without any money in his pockets.  </p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that so many blacks like this one think that documented crime, violence, and a lack of intelligence are incorrect stereotypes of blacks, when there&rsquo;s an absolute wealth of information proving that blacks are the least intelligent and most crime prone race on earth.</p>
<p>The truth is <span class="caps">NOT </span>a stereotype.</p>
<p>She probably thinks she got her position writing silly, worthless columns because of her ability and not because they needed a token black on the staff to satisfy the <span class="caps">EEOC.</span></p>

					<p>Mr. Sundeep does not really know American culture.  <span class="caps">MLK </span>day is a white marxist holiday.  The blacks couldn&rsquo;t care less.  </p>
<p>In more affluent area of <span class="caps">LA, </span>idle trustfunders occasionally give birthday parties or even weddings for their dogs.  Let me assure you, the dogs do not really know it is their birthday.</p>

					<p>I have worked in black areas for the past 20 years. Its extremely common among &#8220;Black Owned&#8221; convenience/liquor stores that are run exactly as described, glassed off with bulletproof plexiglass, and a rotating drum where cash is deposited and merchandise dispensed. Nobody touches anything until its paid for. Restaurants work the same way, no seats, everything is carryout. The <span class="caps">FEW KFC</span>/Burger Kings in these areas are always well supervised by off duty (black) security. Not surprisingly, the McDonalds play place was removed quickly from the new McDonalds, which went with a rapid &#8216;remodeling&rsquo; just a year or two after its&rsquo; grand opening. Aparently a free indoor playground became a problem for management when blacks are assumed to behave like whites. </p>
<p>   If the higher IQ blacks can see that its not profitable to leave merchandise wide open to their &#8216;brothers&rsquo;, why would anyone else think otherwise? </p>

					<p> If we all just grabbed merchandise as we pleased the economy would come crashing down upon our heads and we wouldn&rsquo;t have stores to buy from or the prices would be horribly inflated to offset the theivery. Hmmm! isn&rsquo;t that what happens at convienence stores now?</p>

					<p>You also know your area is going black when the condiment stand goes behind the counter, blacker when they begin to charge for each condiment. Free coffee refill decanters quickly become a thing of the past. Actually anything based on the honor system quickly disappears.</p>

					<p>Why do these &#8220;kids&#8221; act this way?  The grim truth of the matter is that the human experience for them isn&rsquo;t the same as it is for whites.  They do the unthinkable, because they don&rsquo;t think the same way.</p>
<p>Something is wrong with them, as evidenced by their complete lack of any society that predates contact with the white man.  They do not form societies because individuals have a <span class="caps">STRONG </span>genetic predisposition toward psychopathic behavior and a sociopathic outlook.  Groups of people cannot cooperate when the focus of the individuals is that of a fish eating a smaller fish, eating a still smaller fish.  Constantly looking for victims while trying to avoid being victimized.</p>
<p>Not being able to build their own societies means they most certainly cannot integrate into ours successfully, even as slaves.  Supremacy and social control is pointless with them.  Only separation is a viable solution, and only for us.  Once separated, blacks will face a grim fate as every single institution for them, dissolves.  We maintain that for them, as they cannot maintain it themselves.  This would not be a problem so much except they hate us for it and actively seek to harm people every chance they get.  We really have no choice but to leave them to their fate.  Eventually, they will force us to act.</p>

Blacks <span class="caps">ARE </span>a stereotype. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s impossible to rid society and consciousness of racial differences and realities.</p>
<p>I ride mass transit and not a ride goes by without a group of blacks talking jive which is straight out of the crow scene from Dumbo. I more than anyone wish the real stereotype would stop so I didn&rsquo;t have to experience it every day.</p>
<p>Even if you could purge society, art, and culture of the stereotype, the stereotype would still be right in front of you.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure their explanation would be that the memory of &#8220;slavery&#8221; caused the actions of these out of control thugs. So, it will be excused and &#8220;whitey&#8221; will be at fault. I&rsquo;m waiting for the day when people take responsibility for their own actions.</p>

					<p>The difference between white and black behavior (and I&rsquo;m talking adults) can beasily be perceived on a trip by Bay Area Rapid Transit.  At any station, you will be threatened and harrassed for money by both the adults and the children.  The distance between parent and child is as endless as the station, no matter how young the child.  They know their bratty tots won&rsquo;t be kidnapped.  Threatening behavior continues during the ride, but it peaks right around Oakland, the pedominantly black city.  Everyone lets their breath out after those stations.  These stations are also the only ones where you will find no bus maps or paper flyers available of any kind.  Black people can&rsquo;t be trusted with them.  At any other station, you can easily figure out where you are and where you want to go because there are stacks of paper maps available for you to take and keep.  But never in Oakland, of the several stations in the city.  The maps are all bolted to the ground and hidden behind plastic, with scribbles all over them.</p>

					<p>I see from the postings that a lot of people are fed up with anti-social, criminal behavior that is excused by liberals and so-called black leaders. Fed up. Had it up to here! </p>

					<p>&#8220;On occasion they would try to mob this litle grocery store, but the owners would always lock the door and admit them two at a time and follow them around the store. Of course they would curse and spit on the floor complaining about how they were being treated, but the owners would always tell them they could go somewhere else if they didn&rsquo;t like it.&#8221; Jim</p>
<p>Unfortunately, today Jim, the &#8220;youths&#8221; could sue the small grocery store owners for violation of their civil rights and collect huge damages. I feel sorry for these small independent business people today.  They have to charge high prices in most black neighborhoods because of pilfering and shoplifting. In addition, they stand a real possibility of being robbed or worse.<br>

					<p>There once was a cafeteria-style sandwich shop in a mall in downtown St Louis I used to patronize while attending conventions in town.  In addition to lunch, they served a decent breakfast of eggs, choice of meat, hash browns, toast, and coffee for $3.50 - albeit, on paper plates with plastic utensils but still a welcome break from hotel restaurant prices. (The shop is now gone, in line with a general evacuation of downtown St Louis by businesses over the past decade due to crime and corrupt city politics)</p>
<p>One morning I was having breakfast there when a scruffy-bearded, stoned-looking, middle-aged black man came in and sat down.  He bought nothing; just sat staring silently at other patrons. After a while, the white female counter clerk asked him if he wanted to order.  He replied, loudly, &#8220;Hell no, b*tch!&#8221;  As the rest of us looked at each other stunned, he got up quickly, walked to the counter, picked up a handful of sausages from the warming tray, and began stuffing them in his mouth as he walked out.  The clerk saw him and told him to put them back or she&rsquo;d summon mall security.  He called her another obscenity, threw the rest of the sausages at her, and ran out.  &#8220;Mall security&#8221; - a mostly disinterested black man in uniform - eventually showed up, but it was clear by then the sausage thief was blocks away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to believe many blacks simply don&rsquo;t view shoplifting and property crimes in general as morally wrong.  To them, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of paying back whitey for slavery. </p>

<p>I completely agree with the post above.  Let&rsquo;s take it one step further.  There is a reason why we used more severe punishment against blacks. That was the only thing their simple minds could understand and the only thing that maintained law and order in society. </p>

					<p>  I think a great deal of this goes even as far as their faith. Most are Baptists and have essentially no guidance towards reading the Bible beyond their own intellect/imagination. Their churches and Biblical interpretation are often nothing more than the feelings of their particular pastor and what side of the bed he awoke. They believe in no centralizing authority on the word of God and anyone can interpret it as they please. Just as they see life and the law in general but more spefically white people. </p>
<p>  How many times have you heard them reference the Bible for their own justification? Today I had a black non demominational preacher basically tell me that slavery is acceptable because it is found in the Bible and Hitler made a good Christian if he accepted Jesus as his personal lord and savior. Amazing really.</p>

					<p>Of course Black behavior has gotten worse since King died, and not because King died; but because of the extent of the enabling, which of course led to an automatic and twisted relationship between Enabler and Dependent that continues to this day.</p>
<p>Blacks in America went from being victimized to being spoiled. I doubt if any Black American has had a psychologically healthy day in his or her life.  </p>
<p>In any event, the enabling led to lower standards of a people who still had yet to be acculturated into the mainstream.  The result, ignorance, surrilousness, and violence.</p>
<p>All this and yet for the LA Times the bad thing is that these &#8220;youths&#8221; were disrespectful on a &#8220;sacred day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Missing the point entirely, ie; it was the enabling following the death of King that was responsible for the behavior they are complaining about in this article.</p>
<p>I guess what&rsquo;s implicit in this piece is that the more out of control their behavior gets, the more &#8220;sacred&#8221; MLK day will become.<br>

					<p>  Do not take this as a personal attack against Protestant beliefs. I am merely talking about the odious ramifications of far too much desentralization and it&rsquo;s effects on the black populace. </p>
<p>  When you are free to interpret anything in whatever way you please and then of course teach others whom look to you as the truthful interpreter it becomes quite the dangerous scam.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;Primitive people need primitive justice. Jail Mammy when her baby steals something.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This would be tantamount to &#8220;sippenhaft.&#8221; </p>
<p>(Go to : <br>
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sippenhaft<br><br>
please). </p>
<p>Left-wing Wikipedia of course explains this particular form of collective punishment only by its evil association with Naziism. </p>
<p>I have long felt that Islamic radicalism would be defeated if a modern form of Sippenhaft were introduced in the Middle East: Johnny Jihad would think twice before blowing his dirty beard self up if he knew that his burka-covered dark ages  mom and indeed his entire family would be punished for his sickening deed (for which the family will venerate him anyway, which by itself should be a crime in the civilized world).  </p>
<p>Isreal practices a similar form of collective punishment using bulldozers. Can you blame them?</p>
<p>The three foundations of all forms of political correction are: </p>
<p>1 - slavery <br>
2 - colonialism <br><br>
3- naziism </p>
<p>Somebody please post a short history of sippenhaft, or an analysis of it. </p>
