						<p>Belarus on Friday jailed for three years an editor of an independent newspaper who reproduced cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad that first appeared in Denmark in 2005 and caused mass demonstrations across the Muslim world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Belarussian authorities shut down the &#8220;Zgoda&#8221; (Consensus) paper in March 2006, around the time when other European journals began reprinting the cartoons. The security service, still known by its Soviet-era name, the KGB, began an investigation after Muslims in the ex-Soviet state complained.</p>
<p>Editor Alexander Sdvizhkov was sentenced to three years in jail in a closed session of the court for incitement of religious and national hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;May God and the holy cross be with us,&#8221; Sdvizhkov said afterwards. His lawyer said she would appeal.</p>
<p>Muslims constitute about two or three percent of the 10 million residents of the country wedged between Russia and three members of the European Union. The Muslim community had called for leniency in the case.</p>

															<a href="https://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=3202573" target="_new">Golfweek Fires Editor Responsible for &lsquo;Noose&rsquo; Imagery</a> 
						</div>
										<p>

								ESPN.com, January 20, 2008

						</p>
										<p>
						<p>Ten days after a Golf Channel anchor was suspended for her use of "lynch" in commentary on Tiger Woods, an editor was fired Friday for illustrating the controversy with a noose on the cover of Golfweek magazine.</p>
<p>Dave Seanor, vice president and editor who took responsibility for the noose cover of the Jan. 19 issue, was replaced by Jeff Babineau.</p>
<p>"We apologize for creating this graphic cover that received extreme negative reaction from consumers, subscribers and advertisers across the country," Turnstile Publishing Co. president William J. Kupper Jr. said. "We were trying to convey the controversial issue with a strong and provocative graphic image. It is now obvious that the overall reaction to our cover deeply offended many people. For that, we are deeply apologetic."</p>
<p>Turnstile is the parent company of Golfweek, which has a circulation of about 160,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem called the Golfweek cover "outrageous and irresponsible" and accused the magazine of tabloid journalism. He distanced himself from the firing of Seanor with a statement from the PGA Tour that Finchem merely was responding to an inquiry, and that his comments were not a "call to action."</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The episode began Jan. 4 during the second round of the season-opening Mercedes-Benz Championship when Tilghman and analyst Nick Faldo were discussing possible challengers to Woods.</p>
<p>Faldo suggested that "to take Tiger on, maybe they should just gang up [on him] for a while."</p>
<p>"Lynch him in a back alley," Tilghman said, laughing.</p>
<p>Golf Channel issued a statement four days later to say it regretted the comment and that Tilghman had apologized to Woods. But when the Rev. Al Sharpton demanded on CNN that she be fired, Golf Channel suspended Tilghman for two weeks.</p>
<p>The Golfweek cover shows a noose against a purple sky with the title, "Caught in a Noose." The subtitle said, "Tilghman slips up, and Golf Channel can&rsquo;t wriggle free." For many, the noose is symbol of lynchings in the Old South. According to Tuskeege University, 3,466 blacks were lynched in the United States from 1882 to 1968.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an editorial, the magazine explained why it felt the Tilghman story deserved so much attention. It was accompanied by a cartoon that showed Sharpton holding a noose and offering it to a pair of Golf Channel employees staring into a hole of thin ice, presumably where Tilghman had been standing.</p>
<p>"One [potential] cover we had this week was on the young Australian phenom Jason Day," Babineau said Friday in an interview on the Dan Patrick radio program, "and had we had to do it over again, certainly we wish we could go back to Monday and put that one on the cover."</p>
<p>Babineau said he will write a story in the next issue of Golfweek to address the controversy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The harshest criticism came from Finchem. The PGA Tour is in the second year of an unprecedented 15-year contract with Golf Channel to broadcast its weekday coverage and full coverage of 14 tournaments.</p>
<p>"Clearly, what Kelly said was inappropriate and unfortunate, and she obviously regrets her choice of words," Finchem said in a statement. "But we consider Golfweek&rsquo;s imagery of a swinging noose on its cover to be outrageous and irresponsible. It smacks of tabloid journalism. It was a naked attempt to inflame and keep alive an incident that was heading to an appropriate conclusion."</p>
<p>The tour issued a statement Friday that said Finchem&rsquo;s comments were "a response to an inquiry and an expression of the tour&rsquo;s dissatisfaction with Golfweek&rsquo;s choice of a cover image." The tour said Golfweek&rsquo;s decision on its editorial leadership was an internal matter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CBSSports.com reported Thursday that Jack Peter, chief operating officer of the World Golf Hall of Fame, said tour officials had told the magazine it might withdraw $50,000 in advertisements for the World Golf Village.</p>
<p>"Jack was not speaking on behalf of the PGA Tour," spokesman Ty Votaw said Friday. "I can categorically tell you the PGA Tour has not threatened any advertising pull."</p>

<p>Sheesh   &mdash;   Belarus? I thought the former-Soviet states were supposed to be the last remaining repositories of caucasian ethnic loyalty and pre-PC racial sanity? </p>
<p><span class="caps">PLUS </span>the <span class="caps">USSR </span>was officially <span class="caps">ATHEIST, </span>so why should the people of Belarus care what Muslims think   &mdash;   especially if they&rsquo;re only &#8220;two or three percent of the population&#8221;? </p>
<p>And what happens when they reach 10%   &mdash;   like in France? </p>
<p>Presumably the answer is: &#8220;Civil unrest, low-level terrorism, and 10,000 torched autos&#8221;   &mdash;   like in France.<br>

<p>The jailing of the independent newspaper publisher under the auspices of promoting racial hatred demonstrates that Belarus is operated by the same people who own Germany and Austria.  </p>

					<p>Just a guess - but I suspect more than 95% or golfers and the consumers of golf-related products in the US are White or Asian. But perhaps for a tiny group of Tiger Woods wannbes, who exactly was it that was so &#8220;offended&#8221; by any of this foolishness? Woods himself evidently said the original flap was much ado about nothing. The hysteria continues apace&hellip;</p>

					<p>I <i>suspect</i> the Belarus thing falls a bit outside the typical Amren experience of <span class="caps">PC. </span> Belarus seems to be Russia&rsquo;s last remaining closely allied former satellite; if her PC laws are like Russia&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re actually enforced across the board.  As in, I read a blurb in a <span class="caps">CIS </span>&#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221; monitor journal some time back about how <strong>shock!</strong>  <strong>horror!</strong> a <i>Jew</i> had been convicted under Russia&rsquo;s laws for printing hate speech or somesuch against Mother Russia - not at all business as usual.</p>
<p>Someone please correct me if I&rsquo;m in error.</p>

					<p>  I will henceforth cancel my subscription to the racist publication GolfWeek, and I will never hit a golf ball again. GolfWeek&rsquo;s fawning over Tiger Woods was just a trick to distract us from their racist machinations. Now we all can see through their hateful schemes. I am very glad that we have unmasked those elitest, cryto-racists  &mdash;  long live diversity!</p>

					<p>People need to understand that this sort of event is a warning sign of a second rise of nazism.

					<p>Every day they change the rules. Suddenly, within a day or two the word &#8220;noose&#8221;, or a depiction of a noose has become a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;. Where they are going with this is a criminalization of everything that a White person says, does or thinks, or doesn&rsquo;t say, do or think but is accused of.<br>

8:52 is right.  the &#8220;gutless corporate greed mongers&#8221;   are obsessed with protecting their investments in their shopping malls and their supermarkets.<br><br>
These timid capitalists  will not escape the civil upheaveal that they have actually brought about through their anti-American, pro-alien policies which have dispossessed the American middle and working classes and turned us into their serfs. The wrath that they reap will be richly deserved.</p>

					<p>A similar case is ongoing in Canada. Ira Levant, the publisher of the Alberta magazine the Western Standard, was hauled before the quasi-judicial body know as the Human Rights Commission (an Orwellian term-the job of the <span class="caps">HRC </span>is to deprive-Whites only of course- their human right to free speech). Mr Levant&rsquo;s magazine published the Muhammed cartoons and was promptly the subject of a complaint made by a radical Muslim immam-a person who has called for jihad and the murder of Jews and Christians (all without the <span class="caps">HRC </span>becoming involved of course) and was suspected by many to be the insigator of the firebombing of Levant&rsquo;s place of worship. So this is what Canada, with its creeping Marxist totalitarianism has come to: a genocidal Muslim fanatic using the Marxist organs of the Canadian goverment to enforce his fatwa. The whole gist of the interrogation seemed to be an attempt to discover Levant&rsquo;s intent  &mdash;  -his <span class="caps">THOUGHTCRIME.</span> To his immense credit Levant, when facing his inquisitor, told them to do their worst and called them what they really are: thugs. He also-with very reluctant permission by the <span class="caps">HRC</span> Marxist female inquisitor-was allowed to vidio tape the encounter. He has posted the incredible sessions on You Tube, where it has accumulated 250,000 hits. It is with no surprise though, that the Canadian media has not reported this in any way, leaving it up to the Americans to do. MY country&hellip;.how sad and sickening.</p>

&gt; That&rsquo;s right the <span class="caps">USSR </span>was &#8220;officially&#8221; atheist, but few if any people were ever arrested for being Christians (although Jewish arrests did still occur).  The vast majority of Stalins purges were of ethnic groups that represented underground smuggling and crime rings.  The remainder were of suspected political foes (which he came to believe were all around him - he was a psychotic paranoid).  If you have been around many Russians or other slavs from other former communist countries, (and I lived and worked in one for two years privately) you would soon learn that few actually gave up their religion or practices even though the chruches were closed down.  The communist state was against the interferrence - the huge power of the establishment church in government affairs and in that one instance, I think they got it right.  Recall that a &#8220;crazy&#8221; Orthodox priest had greatly helped the fall of the Romanoff&rsquo;s.  And then they had the long history of political preachers in Europe that helped foment the devastating religous wars in Europe.  </p>
<p>But Belarus has always been a region of reactionary extremes, one way or another. <br>

					<p><i>I suspect the Belarus thing falls a bit outside the typical Amren experience of <span class="caps">PC.</span> Belarus seems to be Russia&rsquo;s last remaining closely allied former satellite; if her PC laws are like Russia&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re actually enforced across the board.</i></p>
<p>You are right here. Laws in the former Soviet states which superficially resemble our PC laws are not just for the benefit of minorities. They exist to maintain social stability (and sometimes also to serve foreign policy) - and are applied evenly across the board. They are similar to laws in Asian countries such as Singapore. Singapore has laws against racial vilification - not to &#8216;uplift&rsquo; Malays at the expense of the Chinese majority, but simply to maintain stability and prevent ethnic riots. Malays are just as likely to be convicted as Chinese.</p>
<p>Russia banned &#8216;Borat&rsquo; last year - not a PC move in a Western sense, but rather done to maintain the peace and not annoy their close neighbours. I understand that Belarus is on good terms with  countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Byelorussians perhaps think that this harsh sentence will help maintain these relationships. After all Belarus is a pariah in the West and has really no choice but to turn to China and the Middle East.<br>

					<p>It is absolutely ridiculous pandering to the very people who would/will destroy us when they obtain enough numbers/power.</p>
<p>If it is &#8220;incitement&#8221; to have that magazine cover, then is it not also incitement to racial hatred for the blacks and muslims to make big issues over nothing, inciting <span class="caps">THEIR </span>people to hatred, animosity, and even rioting?  At least the readers of Golf magazine, and white people in general, don&rsquo;t burn down vast neighborhoods, burn hundreds of cars, throw rocks at police, rape and kill folks who are a different ethnicity while expressing their &#8220;displeasure&#8221;.</p>
<p>All we are doing by showing this kind of slavish weakness is embolden the enemies of civilized culture.  We are proving to them we are weak, gutless and have no strength of purpose which only hastens the day they will turn on us all merely because we exist.  We convince them we are too gutless to stand up for ourselves and <span class="caps">OUR </span>values.  No wonder they think they can be successful in eliminating ours and forcing theirs on us.  We help them do it with our tails between our legs.</p>
<p>Does anybody remember when the entire Hollywood crowd boycotted Sammy Davis Jr&rsquo;s wedding?  Even though they were commies back then, they at least respected their own white culture enough to vote displeasure by non-attendance.  <span class="caps">NOW </span>those gutless, immoral commies in Hollywood are doing everything they can to destroy their own culture while pushing third world culture on us. </p>
