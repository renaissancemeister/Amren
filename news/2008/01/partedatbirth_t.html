						<p>A pair of twins who were adopted by separate families as babies got married without knowing they were brother and sister, a peer told the House of Lords.</p>
<p>A court annulled the British couple&rsquo;s union after they discovered their true relationship, Lord Alton said.</p>
<p>The peer &mdash; who heard of the case from a judge who was involved &mdash; said the twins felt an &#8220;inevitable attraction&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said the case showed how important it was for children to be able to find out about their biological parents.</p>
<p>Details of the identities of the twins involved have been kept secret, but Lord Alton said the pair did not realise they were related until after their marriage.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Truth will out&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The crossbench peer, a former Liberal Democrat MP, raised the couple&rsquo;s case during a House of Lords debate on the Human Fertility and Embryology Bill in December.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were never told that they were twins,&#8221; he told the Lords.</p>
<p>&#8220;They met later in life and felt an inevitable attraction, and the judge had to deal with the consequences of the marriage that they entered into and all the issues of their separation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told the BBC News website that their story raises the wider issue of the importance of strengthening the rights of children to know the identities of their biological parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you start trying to conceal someone&rsquo;s identity, sooner or later the truth will out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you don&rsquo;t know you are biologically related to someone, you may become attracted to them and tragedies like this may occur.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pam Hodgkins, chief executive officer of the charity Adults Affected by Adoption (NORCAP) said there had been previous cases of separated siblings being attracted to each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a resistance, a very strong incest taboo where we are aware that someone is a biological relative,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when we are unaware of that relationship, we are naturally drawn to people who are quite similar to ourselves.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Incredibly rare&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;And of course there is unlikely to be anyone more similar to any individual than their sibling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mo O&rsquo;Reilly, director of child placement for the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, said the situation was traumatic for the people involved, but incredibly rare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty or 40 years ago it would have been more likely that twins be separated and, brought up without knowledge of each other,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Today, however, adopted children grow up with a greater knowledge of their birth families &mdash; and organisations try to place brothers and sisters together.</p>
<p>If that were not possible, the siblings would still have some form of contact with each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;This sad case illustrates why, over the last 20-30 years, the shift to openness in adoption was so important,&#8221; Ms O&rsquo;Reilly added.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how these Brits feel it&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s business to enforce certain types of taboos, but not to enforce other types of taboos - to forbid some marriages because of an increased risk of birth defects, but not to forbid others.  I wonder if it ever occcurs to them that they arbitrarily assume certain attitudes that, if held by others in an equally arbitrary way, they would dismiss as bigoted.</p>

			<p>As an adopted child who was adopted when I was 5 years old back in 1955&hellip;I can attest to the fact that being adopted&hellip;and not told who your biological parents are&hellip;if you have biological sisters or brothers&hellip;or family members of any type&hellip;to not know what your ethnicity is&hellip;what diseases run in your family&hellip;to have a piece of yourself missing is truly traumatic!&hellip;I was adopted in New York which still keeps adoption records sealed!&hellip;we adoptees will never know who we truly are!&hellip;people are born into their ethnicity&hellip;you can&rsquo;t give that to a person!<br>
While there are some who would say that the adoptee who wants to know their roots, heritage and who they are&hellip;should be grateful to the parents that adopted and loved them&hellip;that they shouldn&rsquo;t be so ungrateful to their parents&hellip;what about those of us who were adopted by mentally unstable parents&hellip;in my case it was my mother&hellip;who, from the day she finally told me I was adopted&hellip;at the age of 12 under very unpleasant circumstances&hellip;told me every day of my life til she passed away that she should have left me in the gutter where she found me and that I belonged to her as she had bought and paid for me&hellip;to those people out there who live in that fairy tale land where all adopted children are wanted by their adoptive parents&hellip;wake up!&hellip;however, while everyone is clamoring about civil rights and equal rights&hellip;there is another class of people who are being denied their basic fundamental right to know their background and heritage!&hellip;what about US?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like to see more proof of this story. Articles like this  prove why American citizens adopt outside of their country and many go to other races. They won&rsquo;t have to worry about the birth mother coming forward all of a sudden claiming her kid, or trying to hook up with him at another time.  What I&rsquo;m say is if you adopt you need to know YOU ARE THE PARENT without interference.  When the kid is old enough to seek out his biological parent and IF he chooses, then it would be their decision.  &#8220;Knowing the identify of your biological parent&#8221; is a private matter.  Sounds like more butting in from the gov&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>In one generation there probably would not be any birth defects unless the parents carried some particularly bad genes. Birth defects start showing up when inbreeding occurs again and again over the generations (ie small towns, or the Hapsbergs, etc&hellip;)</p>
<p>In the animal world dog breeders frequently will breed half siblings, and cousins to magnify desirable traits (yes it can turn bad and magnify negative traits too if they are not careful). But a one time breeding is usually not a problem for otherwise healthy people.</p>

			<p>There is an extremely easy way to prevent this. Twins should NEVER be separated for adoption! There are countless families that will adopt twins (at least here in the US.</p>
<p>Of course part of the problem is that the Brits and Europe in general are not known for altruism. EU citizens expect the government to do everything for them. That&rsquo;s why for example, the average American gives 14.5 times as much to charty as an average German. As much as the French are disliked they give more per person than any other EU people. But Americans on average still give 4.5 times as much as the French. </p>

			<p>Howard I doubt there would have been any disasterous effects. </p>
<p>You do not see retarded race horses or retarded show cows. Let&rsquo;s get over the myth of blood realtions. A myth created so Europeans would marry outside of thier race. </p>
<p>In the European religions of Asatru and Odinism on would often marry within the kindred. Ancestory came before universalism. At one time I supose Europe was one big family, cousins amongst cousins. </p>
<p>A sister might be a little close, but a first cousin would maintain a line of genetics. </p>

<p>remember Hera is Zeus&rsquo; wife and sister, which can be interpreted as ancestor worship. inbreeding is how homogenetic nations are born. countless of such accounts can be researched in the Bible and other traditions.</p>

<p>it is interesting to point out that within a race Caucasians exhibit the most heterogenetic features. in contrast, the Chin(g) (Chan in Cantonese, Chen, Chun, Tan) (pop. 1.6 billion) people from China, descendants of Han are one of the most homogenetic nations, which contradicts ideas of races dying out because inbreeding or lack of diversity.</p>

It is my understanding that Cleopatra was the descendant of an uninterrupted brother and sister union for 13 or 14 generations.  She was considered to be the most beautiful women in the world at that time and her intelligence was well regarded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as I understand it, the Catholic Church made incest illegal as a means of breaking up and weakening the large family fortunes.  The church did this about the same time they did away with polygamy which was a tactic used so they could recruit soldiers&hellip; they promised wives in exchange for military service.</p>

			<p>Here in Czechia we had also a similar sad case of half-siblings having a child together. The mother of both was a Gypsy. If I remember it correctly, the fathers were Czechs and the boy was raised in the family of his father. Later he met his half sister at a disco, they fell in love and had a child without knowing anything about their common ancestry. </p>
<p>Only then the Gypsy mother found necessary to go to police and accused the young couple of incest&hellip;They can&rsquo;t get married, but they live together and raise thir child, who is completely healthy. They were prohibited by court to have further physical contacts.</p>
<p>I only wonder what stories we will hear in the future, when all the kids from the now so popular assisted reproduction procedures, made from donor eggs and donor sperm, will start their search for partners&hellip;the chance of meeting someone made from the same donor material is not negligible&hellip;<br>

			<p>Two points occur to me regarding incest-</p>
<p>We are told that eugenics is wrong, because it is associated with fascism, etc. But when you think about it, isnt the injunction against incest basically a primitive form of eugenics, ie it society/the state trying to ensure the health of the gene pool? Laws against incest are basically biblical eugenics, yet are not seen as &#8216;evil&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Witnessing the high number of illegitimate births in the rougher (or &#8216;deprived&rsquo; if you prefer) areas where often the mother does not know who the father is, it occured to me that in twenty years time we may see evidence of interbreeding taking place in Britains council estates. In such areas there is already a strong tendency to breed with people on the same estates (naturally enough) but more and more young people may find that they are inadvertantly breeding with their half brothers and sisters. Another unforseen consequence of the breakdown of marriage and sexual morality in Britain. I daresay the same problem may inflict parts of inner city America, too. </p>

			<p>&#8220;We are naturally drawn to people similar to ourselves.&#8221; </p>
<p>The only ones who seem naturally-drawn this way are non-whites. It&rsquo;s not just that whites want to use non-whites for sex, marriage, and making babies, whites are the only ones NOT practicing this &#8216;ethnocentrism&rsquo; or, &#8216;racism&rsquo;, across the board. Visit the fan pages of non-white stars like Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, or Usher, or sports stars: They are filled with adoring white fans, while the number of non-whites who are serious fans of white personalities is virtually zero. It is non-whites who practice this &#8216;bigotry&rsquo;. They revel in it. It may be true that people are &#8216;naturally&rsquo; drawn to those like themselves, however, the media&rsquo;s anti-white guilt tactics seem able to overcome this natural proclivity or &#8216;survival mechanism&rsquo; where whites are concerned, no matter how afraid they may be. No matter how much real danger they may actually be in.</p>
<p>When I read, &#8220;We are naturally drawn to people similar to ourselves&#8221; I think, Ok this may be true, but considering the real world situation, where non-whites are segregating, hating, and being proud of who they are, while whites are proud of them too&hellip; considering our real world, I think that this rational, this focus, is one that simply gives credence to the very real actions of our non-white colonizers.</p>

			<p>In Pakistani culture, marrying your first cousin is totally acceptable and widely practised among those living here in the UK. However the MSM never questions this part of their culture. <br>

<p>Skank though she may be, Aguilera is white.  Semi-nude photos of her are easy to find, &amp; pretty conclusive.</p>

			<p>Why is this article on Amren? Is it supposed to be an argument against interracial breeding? It could just as easily be used to argue against an Anglo-Saxon breeding with a Greek. Maybe we should all just keep it in the family.</p>

			<p>Chrisitna Aguilera is not white? I have seen pics of her father, and he looks like a White man to me; unless you are judging him solely based on ethnicity and not race(as Americans are prone to do).</p>

			<p>&#8220;I have often wondered if this type of thing had ever happened. I hate to think of the disastrous results if they would have bred.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be silly!  Nothing &#8220;disasterous&#8221; would have happened.  It is just that if this happens repeatedly, certain genetic problems can occur.  For some reason, this incest thing has become a psycho-drama for Western socities.  This does NOT mean that I am in favor of it!</p>
<p>If you study genetics and history you will have to realize that close relatives interbred for centuries.  That is how race and certain physical characteristics came to develope.  Not long ago it was possible to distinguish which part of England you were in by the look of the local populace.  The same for many other regions of Europe.  Do you imagine for example, that everyone in Sweden has not sister or cousin there and everyone somehow was able to avoid some inbreeding?  Yet Swedes could be said to be amoung some of the most attractive people on the planet, and not short on IQ ratings either.  Marrying cousins not only used to be widely practiced, but it was considered good sense.  Do yo think that tribes contained members with no genetic relationship?</p>
<p>I wonder if many American Amren posters are actually brainwashed against the mind that could help the white race survive and even revive - tragically  not realizing it?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help throwing this one in;  If Adam and Eve were the first humans, didn&rsquo;t their kids commit incest and must they not have created a race of genetic goons?</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;re drawn to people similar to ourselves - this usually means people that have similar views, dress code, economics; Not necessarily race. Aesthetics often works the opposite way. People who look different (ex skin color) may be MORE attracted to each other because of that difference. The other similarities are what keep relationships intact.</p>

<p>I just love it when you white Europeans insult us Americans about our race relations. Just you wait. In a few years when you have enough Arabs and Africans in YOUR country, you will have the &#8220;American Disease&#8221;.</p>
<p>You will regret this suicidal act your nation is committing. You have no crime in your cities, no hate, no forced busing or integration. You have peace and harmony but ALL OF THAT will end when the Arabs and Africans assault your white society.</p>
<p>Just you wait. But, then it is too late.</p>

			<p>It reminds me of an incident in my travels in Europe. I meet this very nice lady who was with her children. As we were talking she mentioned (without a wince) that her husband was her first cousin. She was from Tunisia where this is common. She had 3 children with her husband. His first child was with another woman (not blood related) and the difference was amazing. The first child DEFINETLY looked much more healthier. The skin looked nourished and strong and overall she looked more &#8220;natural&#8221;. The other children looked weaker, paler and under nourished when in reality they weren&rsquo;t. Very nice people but I think inter-breeding does make a big difference with humans&hellip;We are not animals&hellip;.</p>
