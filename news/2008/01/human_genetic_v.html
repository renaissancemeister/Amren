<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In 2007, researchers were dazzled by the degree to which genomes differ from one human to another and began to understand the role of these variations in disease and personal traits. Science and its publisher, AAAS, the nonprofit science society, recognize &#8220;Human Genetic Variation&#8221; as the Breakthrough of the Year, and identify nine other of the year&rsquo;s most significant scientific accomplishments.</p>
<p>&#8220;For years we&rsquo;ve been hearing about how similar people are to one another and even to other apes,&#8221; said Robert Coontz, deputy news editor for physical sciences who managed the selection process. &#8220;In 2007, advances on several fronts drove home for the first time how much DNA differs from person to person, too. It&rsquo;s a huge conceptual leap that will affect everything from how doctors treat diseases to how we see ourselves and protect our privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The genomes of several individuals have already been sequenced. As technologies advance, many of us will have some, perhaps all, of our own genomes sequenced and will be able to learn the diseases for which we are at risk.</p>
<p>Since the sequencing of the human genome, biologists have been charting minute variations as small as one base, called single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These variations were key to a dozen research projects in 2007 called genome-wide association studies in which researchers compared the DNA of thousands of individuals with and without a disease to determine which small genetic variants pose risks. This information can help lead researchers to disease-related genes, as in the case of several type 2 diabetes genes found this year.</p>
<p>Genome-wide association studies this year provided insight into many diseases, including atrial fibrillation, autoimmune disease, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, type 1 and 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>In 2007, biologists also learned that within DNA&rsquo;s billions of bases, thousands to millions of them can get lost, added or copied in ways that can change genetic activity within a few generations. The effects of these &#8220;copy number variants&#8221; have been shown in populations with high-starch diets, as they have more copies of a gene for digesting starch than members of societies of hunter gatherers. Geneticists who studied the genomes of children with and without autism have found a new DNA modification that leads to increased risk for autism.</p>

<p>Other notable research advances include:</p>

<p>* Game Over: In a tour de force of artificial-intelligence programming, checkers became the most complex game ever &#8220;solved&#8221; by computers. Researchers show that the game will end in a draw if neither player makes a mistake.</p>
<p>Areas to Watch in 2008 include microRNA, human-made microbes, new computer-chip material, genomes of human bacteria and the Neandertal, human neural circuitry and data from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.</p>

			<p>Wow. Boas and Stephen J. Gould had me just about convinced that the differences between chimps and humans were all cultural. You mean to tell me that genes actually matter? Where is this all leading?</p>
<p>Some other areas to watch in 2008: geologists find not all rocks the same; astronomers think moon might be different from sun; linguists find evidence that people talk different in other countries &hellip;</p>

			<p>Proclamation to save our independence:</p>
<p>Today is the right time to start Resistance. We have to unite ourselves morally and ideologically. We must start from passive yet powerful resistance. Stop talking. Do as much  as you can to keep our land and race alive.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t respond to any advertisement using blacks and Latinos, ignore them absolutely. <br>
Don&rsquo;t use service of blacks and Latinos, neither doctors, nor laborers.  <br>
Don&rsquo;t watch movies supporting blacks and Latinos. <br>
Don&rsquo;t  buy from black and Latinos, neither proprietors, nor employees. <br>
Stop, Stop, Stop!!! supporting black and Latinos by watching and listening to them in any sports and entertainment. <br>
Don&rsquo;t vote for creatures, neither republicans, nor democrats, supporting welfare for blacks and Latinos, justifying criminal illegal immigration. Let the &lsquo;lawmakers&rsquo; know your attitude. Do it anonymously, yet do it.</p>
<p>Blacks and Latinos ignore our culture. Why do you have to be different!!!</p>
<p>Start reading more and read quality authors. Talk to your family. Aspire to the highest possible level of knowledge and consciousness and bring with you your family. Stop wasting your life  in front of TV. Don&rsquo;t invest money in the black and Latino business. </p>
<p>Economical and moral resistance is a powerful weapon. Use it. Use it persistently and methodically. The result will be here soon, and they will be only positive.</p>
<p>God help us.<br>

			<p>And in another related story, scientists isolate most of the genes responsible for variations in IQ. They all are in a state of shock to discover that intelligence is not distributed evenly amongst the races. Ohh how i wish this happens in 2008!!!!!</p>
