						<p>This is a good time to put in a word for the white working class.</p>
<p>For days, the Democratic campaign for president was mired in a discussion, started by Hillary Clinton, about Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s role in winning passage of civil rights laws. There was also much talk of the crucial part women played in the New Hampshire primary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the long term is another matter. To build a majority this fall and make history, both candidates would need a lot of help from a group with its own reasons to be discontented: the white working class.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working class&#8221; seems an antique term, but the people it describes still exist, more now in the service industries than in manufacturing. Demographers often use education levels as a surrogate for class position, and the past three decades have not been kind to Americans who are not college graduates.</p>
<p>For white male high school grads, average wages stood at $18.44 an hour (in constant 2006 dollars) in 1979. They dropped to $16.06 an hour in 1995. There was then a brief upturn &mdash; wages for such men hit $17.49 in 2002 &mdash; but by 2006, their hourly earnings had fallen to $17.31. White female high school graduates have gained ground, but their wages have recently stagnated too. In 1979, such women earned $11.75 an hour. Their wages peaked at $13.42 in 2003, but dropped to $13.08 in 2006. Similar patterns, at somewhat higher wage levels, are visible over the years for men and women who attended college but didn&rsquo;t graduate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both Clinton and Obama know all this. So does John Edwards, who deserves credit for pushing his competitors to address class issues and whose policies &mdash; and &#8220;son of a millworker&#8221; speeches &mdash; are aimed directly at working-class voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama knows that Clinton has had an edge on him so far among white working-class Democrats, and he has long preached that social reform transcends race and ethnicity. {snip}. &#8220;[What] would help minority workers are the same things that would help white workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>But these themes have been garbled, obscured and distorted by the recent distractions. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not going to win on identity politics,&#8221; said Rep. Artur Davis, an African American Democrat from Alabama whose words should be chiseled on the walls of both campaigns&rsquo; headquarters. &#8220;The Republican Party is sitting there salivating at the prospects of a battle between white females and blacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re dead wrong, Artur old buddy.  The entire FUTURE of America is now ethnic identity politics, whether you or any other slick politician likes it or not.  And, I think it was Peter Brimelow who said once that in any political environment such as that - those ethnic groups who don&rsquo;t figure this out and play the game the way they should - these groups will get steam-rolled by the ethnic groups who DO play the game.</p>
<p>But then, maybe Artur isn&rsquo;t naive at all.  Maybe Artur and his message is merely designed to con white Americans into keeping a lid on THEIR ethnic solidarity - while Artur and other groups continue to advance theirs?</p>

<p>The past is our guide and all the GOP will do is drool in its pablum.</p>
<p>If elected, they&rsquo;ll spend money like libs, give only lip service to conservative issues, and back down on issues directly affecting White people.  At one time I had great hopes for the Republican Party of the last 25 years.  After people such as Trent Lott, Bush I, George Ryan (in my state), Arlen Specter, and John McCain, however, I see little hope.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hold my nose, vote for the least objectionable candidates, and do my utmost to keep my fate in my OWN hands. </p>

<p>Yes, all three of these Red swine know this and are happy to engage in their class warfare rhetoric, however they also all revel in their plans of flooding this country with illegal aliens, because it is &ldquo;the right thing to do.&rdquo; The very &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; people who are driving down the wages of white and black workers alike in many once lucrative occupations, such as construction. Indeed, diversity has a price and that is one of them; however, according to this troika of jackasses, it is more than worth it. </p>
<p>In the end, they, like most of the Republicans in this race, don&rsquo;t give two hoots about the white working class or the middle class for that matter. They sincerely wish to engulf and drown them with a tsunami of Third World wage competitors, thus equalizing our people with the &ldquo;developing&rdquo; nations hoards of peons and build a global socialist super state. </p>

			<p>Only us the working whites know how our wages have gone down while other cost of living has gone up&hellip;.our taxes go to welfare and other perks for the lazy asses like blacks..illegals&hellip;muslims&hellip;asians ect&hellip;.and our white students must pay full tuition for college&hellip;and soon&hellip;being the fact we can&rsquo;t afford it&hellip;our white college students won&rsquo;t be able to go to college and get that education. I ask this&hellip;who will pick up the slack, who will pay the taxes &hellip;who will educate our children???? We will be a full fledged third world country in a few more years.  You don&rsquo;t think for one MOMENT that blacks or any of the other garbage getting all those perks, will do it??? Hell no, they are busy making more babies for others to support or killing, raping, and doing other things like taking dope ect ect&hellip;well you get the idea&hellip;.we are doomed!!</p>

<p>I wonder how those white high school graduates feel about affirmative action, and the implied &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; aspect of a black man becoming the nominee of a major party? I think the left-leaning Mr. Dionne has figured out for us why Obama won&rsquo;t be the nominee.<br>

Is there any way for a candidate to speak to white voters?</p>
<p>The candidates can go to black churches and hispanic community centers and address black and hispanic issues but how do they speak to whites?</p>
<p>There really isn&rsquo;t a forum or venue where &#8216;white&rsquo; issues (whatever they are) can be discussed or even acknowledged as issues.</p>
<p>Could any candidate go to relatively white neighborhood in a white community center and discuss white on black violence? Blacks dragging down public schools? Jobless illegal aliens milling about? As I said, these issues can&rsquo;t be discussed let alone acknowledged as legitimate concerns of whites. We aren&rsquo;t allowed any place other than here and the Internet to speak our minds and tell things we see them.</p>

			<p>Democrats have traditionally taken the white working class for granted, as if they expect these people to go along with their socially Marxist schemes.  </p>
<p>Just because a person is for labor rights and wants to work for a living wage and good health benefits doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean that (s)he supports gun control and open borders.  If anything, the white working class tends to be rather socially and culturally conservative, which explains why Nixon and Reagan were both elected to the presidency twice.</p>

			<p>I feel that no candidate cares anything about white working class people anymore.  The only people that matter are poor minorities that are always the victims of racism by evil white people and don&rsquo;t really break the law when they illegally sneak into the country.  My son is in Kindergarden and the school did not say a word about the brave men and women who stormed the beach in Normandy on Veteran&rsquo;s Day.  The kid can tell you all about Martin Luther King though because they spend a week talking about him him.  </p>

			<p>When it comes to the issue of wage stagnation, the Democrats must share in the blame, even though it is the Dems who posture as the &#8220;working class party.&#8221;  </p>
<p>In fact, given the Democratic Party&rsquo;s penchant for supporting large-scale immigration and high taxes, one could conceivably make a convincing case that the policies of the Democrats have been more damaging to the working class than the policies of the Republicans.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s my take that the media feeds on these discords between the two front runners in the Democrat party running for president, Obama and Clinton.  All of the talking heads on TV, i.e. Chris Matthews, Wolf Blitzer, et al were going over the same bull about what Hillary said about ML King Jr. the other night and if it would cause a rift within the black community.  The same goes on with the socalled Hispanic vote.  You never, ever hear ANY of these politicians talk about the white working class male and his needs and votes.  They are, like the members of the elitist media, have a contempt for the average white male that knows no bounds.  That&rsquo;s my take on it.  They never talk about the impact that the affirmative action policies and racial set-asides have had on these white workers.  Young whites are kept out of colleges, universities, medical schools and law schools and there is never any mention of it or about it by the likes of Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, Shawn Hannity, or Lou Dobbs.  It is really sickening.  </p>

<p>The problem for Obama is that his two biographical books and his actions make clear his disdain for the white half of his family. His mother was tricked by his father into marriage when his father was already married in Africa, and Obama has never denounced that crime against an American.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget that white working class people are threatened by affirmative action, by new immigrants, and by the export of jobs abroad. Those three policies are embraced by Obama&hellip;what room is left for members of the white working class in his &#8220;bring us together&#8221; kumbaya moment? What could he promise them? The Christmas stocking is empty for them.</p>

			<p>Why should any of them pander to Whites? They know they can count on the dummy Whites to keep on voting for them and never consider themselves a racial group with racial interests. That is reserved only for nonwhites. Don&rsquo;t want to be called a &#8220;racist&#8221; now do we, by insisting we aren&rsquo;t to be taken for granted. That is reserved only for the minorities because we have allowed it to be so&hellip;.</p>

<p>How nice that Mr. Dionne FINALLY addresses this timely topic, but it is too little too late.  After all didn&rsquo;t his paper of note along with every other instrument of dissemination of information totally ENDORSE economic globalism and the phony free-trade agreements, mind numbing over-regulation and taxation of the industries we HAD (what capitalist could RESIST the slave labor the third-world promised) and worshipful praise our new glorious &#8220;service economy.&#8221;  Our country has lost 50 - 60 million manufacturing jobs since the 1980&rsquo;s.  Notice this data is NEVER accounted for by our Leviathan.  A nation that produces NOTHING in the way of desirable goods is NOTHING. Our country manufactures only liars, thieving politicians and financiers anymore.  There is nothing left to plunder.  Considering our current picked-over carcass-status as a &#8220;service economy&#8221; and our freewheeling plunge into utter financial ruin, we don&rsquo;t need your crocodile tears anymore than we needed the NYT&rsquo;s hand wringing over the following:</p>
<p>Blue-Collar Jobs Disappear, Taking Families&rsquo; Way of Life Along <br>

 <br>
Oh, and while weeping tears for the devastated blue-collar workers, how about putting a word in too for the white-collar professionals who are the latest targets for displacement through the assortment of &#8220;Visa&#8221; programs you likewise endorse. And please note that with all those &#8220;blue-collar&#8221; manufacturing jobs, our white-collar management and engineering jobs went too. </p>
<p>We are a nation of rubes and drones, and any White who would even think of voting for anyone other than Ron Paul denotes the formidable odds of salvaging our beloved Republic. Maybe we deserve to fall.</p>
<p>Please I urge everyone to read the following (so important to all Americans&rsquo; in this election) I previously posted, but in the hopes of getting wider exposure with a weekend audience (and please email to others):  </p>

The &#8220;Theory of Democracy&#8221; holds that if the White people can be divided, their votes will effectively cancel each other out, which then permits a focused minority to become the &#8220;balance of power&#8221;, and thereby to rule them for its own purpose. </p>
<p>Until they turned against them following the 60&rsquo;s 70&rsquo;s revolution, the &#8220;new&#8221; Democrats effectively convinced  many worker (&#8220;middle&#8221;) class White people that it was in their best interest to support them on economic grounds only.</p>
<p>With fewer and fewer places available where White people of all classes can flee in order to escape &#8220;Black&#8221; violence, though, this scheme is coming under stress.</p>

<p>Huckabee bragged in a debate a few months ago about getting 48% of the black vote during one of his runs for Gov. of AR.  The only reason he got that is that he was more left-wing than Clinton.  Even with all that, he never got a majority of the black vote.  Proving your point.</p>

			<p>White people still make up about 75% of the US population.  How any educated, self respecting, free-thinking white person can vote for the Democratic party is certainly one of the great mysteries, scams and joir of the universe.</p>
<p>The Dems capitlize on the ignornace of the masses by pandering to them and blaming there situation on rich white men running the corporations and the &#8220;system&#8221;.  The ignorant masses find that theory easy and convienient to believe.</p>
<p>Remember one thing white voters, what will you do when you are outnumbered by the peasant class and they vote to plunder the public treasury, vote to confiscate your home and vote more benefits for themselves while simultaneously complaining of racism, white privilege and the corruption and oppresion of the rich?  What will you do then?  The money to support the parasites will come from taxes.  Taxes come from people who are productive, have property, consume goods, have equity and own companies.</p>
<p>Remember, a highly successful survival tactic in nature is to outnumber your enemy. To produce overwhelming numbers of offspring. What do you think the new peasant (and Muslim) people are doing? And who is cheering them on amd for what reason?</p>
<p>Whites and Asians should united against the socialism of the Democratic party. they should work together to preserve decency, common sense, a civil society and  an end to this suicidal insanity and social experimentation called the Demon-cratic Party.<br>

I agree, acsnyc, but the only candidate on the GOP side so far who has directly done so is Mike Huckabee.  Ron Paul has done so indirectly, blaming the Federal Reserve for devaluing the currency and creating inflation that has more than wiped out any wage gains made by the working class.</p>
<p>As far as the others, they are too busy with their macho posturing against Iran and Pakistan, as if spreading &#8220;democracy&#8221; is more important than fixing America.</p>

			<p>&#8220;John Edwards father was no ordinary millworker. He was actually the boss of the entire mill and a very prominent member of the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, maybe it was his career as a personal injury lawyer suing large corporations (the employers who pay the highest wages to low skill workers in America) including the American Red Cross three times, maybe it&rsquo;s this that keeps Edwards so in touch with the concerns of everyday folk. </p>

<p>I agree with the spirit of your remarks but I&rsquo;m compelled to correct you on one point: No &#8220;women&#8221; stormed the beach at Normandy. It&rsquo;s become nearly a reflex nowadays to refer to the &#8220;men and women&#8221; of the armed services no matter what the context. With no offense intended toward you, Carl, this is another part of PC nonsense that irritates me.</p>
<p>For the record, I&rsquo;m not sure that Obama has to worry since many white Democrats will vote for him simply BECAUSE he&rsquo;s black. It&rsquo;s a way for guilt-ridden whites to show everyone and prove to themselves how righteous and &#8220;fair&#8221; they are. This phenomenon often occurs in high school elections for student body president. I offer my nephew&rsquo;s highly regarded private high school as an example: The school is 70% white and less than 10% black. The rest is roughly a 2 to 1 ratio of Latinos to Asians. A black student has been voted president in 4 of the last 5 years. It&rsquo;s my understanding that this is not uncommon in similar high schools across the country.  </p>

			<p>The Democrat party has always been surprised that so many working class whites, especially men, vote Republican. They think the working class isn&rsquo;t voting their economic interests. What the Dems don&rsquo;t understand is the working class resents seeing poor, lazy, and ignorant people getting welfare, food stamps, HUD, WIC,etc. It&rsquo;s unfair that a hard working person who plays by the rules has to pay taxes to support bad people who make bad life choices.</p>
<p>When the Dems talk about taxing the &#8220;rich&#8221;, a working person doesn&rsquo;t throw his fist in the air in approval, instead he realizes that the Dems consider him rich and he fears for his wallet.  </p>

			<p> Prophetic wisdom from Friedrich Nietzsche:<br>
&#8220;THE values of the weak prevail, because the strong have taken them over as devices of leadership&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Further analysis from the sorely missed Sam Francis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The values of the weak prevail,&#8221; wrote Friedrich Nietzsche, &#8220;because the strong have taken them over as devices of leadership.&#8221; This brief and rather cryptic remark contains virtually all we need to know about why contemporary movements like multiculturalism, feminism, homosexualism, and anti-white racism are such powerful trends in modern American and other Western societies. It is easy enough to say that these movements are merely the revolt of Nietzsche&rsquo;s Untermenschen and the natural consequence of mass democracy and civilizational decline. But what Nietzsche grasped that many modern conservatives, who dislike Nietzsche almost as much as Karl Marx and Hillary Clinton, don&rsquo;t grasp is that what looks like decline, decadence, and decay to conservatives appears to the champions of such trends as progress and the birth of a new civilization. Because conservatives often fail to understand this, they perceive an apocalyptic collapse into anarchy and disorder where there is only an emerging structure of alternative power. The strong &mdash; those who like and want to use power &mdash; make use of unfashionable and forbidden ideas to gain power for themselves. Insofar as they are successful, the results do represent the decline of the kind of social and political order that conservatives are disposed to defend, but that does not mean that some sort of order is not at the same moment about to lurch forth from the apparent chaos.<br>

<p>Every other race, ethnicity, and special interest group votes in lockstep with one another along democratic party lines. Whites, on the other hand, have been so effectively disenfranchised by the &#8220;progressives&#8221; in this country that we shudder at showing any solidarity within our race. Merely thinking or acting in our own best interest is to invite an onslaught of derogatory accusations from these clowns. And make no mistake, it is primarily other Whites that have brought this upon us.  Look no further than the ones planning to silence the honorable Jared Taylor at the upcoming AR conference and at Michigan State University. It is these puppets that have wrought such devastation on our country and way of life. As far as the puppetmasters, I&rsquo;ll leave that up to you to decide.</p>

This is indicative of the fact that too many conservatives believe that Republicans are automatically conservative.  George Bush Junior is no more conservative in terms of his overall policies than your average Democratic U.S. Senator of 25 years ago.  Sam Nunn, for example, had an overall record in the Senate that makes Junior look like Barbara Boxer.  Your own Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, has been far more conservative on immigration matters than &#8220;Dumbya.&#8221;</p>

			<p>New York Guy I know exactly what you mean. The schools I went to were something like 85-90% White with maybe 10-20 blacks in the whole school. Almost every year the Whites would vote for one of those blacks [usually a thug at that] for class president. They would also vote for some hideously ugly black girl for prom queen and a thuggish black guy for prom king. Even back then I knew something was odd about that because there were some VERY gorgeous White girls and handsome &#8220;all American&#8221; White guys that I thought were more deserving. And to top it off, most of these blacks that the Whites voted for were openly anti-White racists!!!!! You will NEVER see the reverse being done at mostly non-White schools. I will go to my grave never understanding Whites that do this!</p>

<p>Understood. My concern is whether the &#8220;class warfare&#8221; approach is ultimately the strategy that wins the hearts and minds of working class whites for the GOP. Hucklenut may gain an advantage in the primaries versus the other GOP candidates with this rhetoric, but in a general election against the party of class warfare, the Democrats, I am not so sure of the prospects for success.</p>
<p>Call me naive, but I am of the belief that a political strategy which imbeds an implicit racial plea to working class whites may be more fruitful. My theory is as follows. Working class whites are taking the brunt of job displacement by lower paid third world immigrants. Furthermore, many working class whites can&rsquo;t escape living among these immigrants and the baggage they bring to the community. So the political pitch becomes this: vote for me and I&rsquo;ll make sure immigrants won&rsquo;t take your jobs and your wife and daughter won&rsquo;t be murdered or raped. </p>
<p>The GOP naturally has &#8220;God and Country&#8221; alignment with these loyal, patriotic and God-fearing Americans. Address the implicit racial angle and my bet is working class whites will vote for that Republican candidate in droves.<br>

 According to columnist Steve Sailer of vdare.com, every <br>
presidential election result in the U.S. throughout our<br>

			<p>Not enough thought and discussion takes place on the folly of having women and blacks vote.  Without these two groups&rsquo; natural proclivity to muck up the political state of affairs, the American government would be less oppressive.   Our wise founding father explicitly excluded them from voting.</p>
<p>Both groups look on the government as agents to extort money and benefits from white men.  </p>
<p>The cute little cub of extending voting to blacks and women grew into a giant ugly monster.  The black affirmative action monster that throw white men out of jobs and promotions just because he&rsquo;s not a privileged black </p>
<p>Women have used their vote to kill unborn babies.  Their crowning achievement has been the Violence against Women Act.  Here white men can go to prison after a date with a scorned woman.  That&rsquo;s power!<br>

			<p> At the end of World War 2 and the passage of the GI bill for education; more white males went to college and recieved the best education America had to offer. Students were taught to think logically and with analytical processes. These are conditions that no politician can stand in thier respective districts.<br>
 Therefore in 1965; Ted Kennedy and others introduced immigration reform, civil rights legislation, and other bills all aimed directly at the white male.Women joined in the mix and as a result, more anti white male laws were brought into being than at any other time in recorded history.Education oficials changed standards in order to brainwash the masses to think in terms of being a member of one world government as opposed to being American. They rewrote the history books to reflect their views and to destroy the image of the white men of the past.<br>
 White males were so busy trying to support thier families that we didn&rsquo;t realise just how bad the situation really had become.<br>
 The future; God only knows. However;with logic and analysis of the present one can get an idea of what lies ahead. To borrow a phrase&#8221; soon the time will come between doing what is right and what is easy&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Although racially conscious whites certainly don&rsquo;t make up a majority of the Republican Party base, we make up a large enough minority of the vote to hand the election over to the Democrats if we stay home on election day.  I say that if some liberal like McCain gets the nomination, we should announce that we are sitting out the election and will continue to do so until the Republican Party addresses the needs of white Americans.  When the Democrats win in a landslide, this will send a message to Washington that we aren&rsquo;t going to take it anymore.  We might as well - there&rsquo;s not much of a difference between McCain and Hillary anyway.  They are both for higher taxes, amnesty for illegals, and gun control.</p>

<p>No, no, no, no, no.  Whites made up about 67% of the population in the 2000 Census, which undercounted illegal aliens and classified all middle eastern type people as white.  Today, real whites are probably something like 62% of the population and dropping fast. </p>

Excellent point, one that I already knew by reading your fine blog.  It&rsquo;s just that I get more upset when the Republicans endorse open-borders policies than the Democrats do, simply because the Republicans are supposed to be the &#8220;law and order&#8221; party, even though I discovered otherwise around 1995 or so (shortly after the &#8220;Republican Revolution&#8221; in 1994 in which the GOP won both houses of Congress).</p>
<p>With regard to the spoiled brat in the White House, you would think that most paleocons would be out in force to support Ron Paul (my pick), Duncan Hunter (your pick), or even Fred Thompson (my prediction to win), instead of an open-borders neocon like John McCain, since supporting McCain essentially means supporting a third Bush term, policy-wise.</p>

<p>Thanks for the compliments, though since I have two blogs, I have to apologize for putting you through twice the trouble.</p>
<p>Thankfully for you, your guy is still in the race   &mdash;   mine dropped out last night.  I personally blame conservative talk radio for never giving Hunter a chance.  Even Michael S., who has DH on as a guest a lot, dismissed his candidacy.  So it became a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more upsetting is that SC Republicans gave 63% of their votes to the two most liberal Republicans.  The silver lining there is that, JM&rsquo;s 33% in victory was less than his 42% he got in his 2000 defeat in SC to Bush.  Since JM hitched his wagon to Lindsey Grahmnesty, I still think Buddy Witherspoon has a good chance to beat Grahamnesty in the R primaries in SC this June.  </p>
<p>One of JM&rsquo;s big troubles is his hot head.  I could easily see him summarily dropping nuclear weapons on a small (or big) country for no reason.  If he&rsquo;s the R nominee, it won&rsquo;t be a third Bush term, it would guarantee a third Clinton term.<br>

			<p>See how the white males have self-destructed within the Democratic Party. Edwards and the others are &#8220;only just white guys&#8221;. I believe Hillary has hoodwinked American women into an antiwhite majority which will carry her to victory. Like the Communists liked to say, Capitalists will sell us the rope to hang themselves. White men providing affirmative action, support of illegal immigration, etc have provided the rope to squash any white political power base. Congressman Dornan saying how wonderful it was for Hispanics to populate California and then losing his seat to one was the first sign of this antiwhite process. Future generations of whites will spit on the graves of their antiwhite forbears selling them out.</p>

			<p> Great post factualist, that&rsquo;s clarity . The time is coming when no white, except maybe a few grovelist will be elected to office . Frankly, I hope Obama obliterates Hillary and Edwards . I would like to see them totally consumed by the multi-cult nation they have so foolishly ushered in . A bitter pill but maybe it will wake a few people up .</p>

<p>Obama beating Feminazi Hillary and special interest sell-out Edwards, wouldn&rsquo;t be a bitter pill to me!<br>

			<p>It makes no difference who is &#8220;president&#8221;. Don&rsquo;t you all know that? The powers behind the scenes, who control our currency, control our government. Been this way since 1913 and Woodrow Wilson even lamented the fact that he sold out his nation under his administration.</p>

			<p>I agree with several posters and have had this view for many years now, despite the fact that my family has voted for Democrats going back to Kennedy, that, any White person who is not employed by the government, local,state,federal, and is voting for the Democrats is certifiably insane, or simply utterly ignorant about the Democratic party.</p>

			<p>&#8220;White people still make up about 75% of the US population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another poster just above has corrected this figure. It was recently reported that U.S. NON-whites now number 100,000,000 people out of a total of 300,000,000.</p>
<p>Yes, American whites are actually now less than 67%   &mdash;   astounding!</p>

			<p>For the record, I&rsquo;m not sure that Obama has to worry since many white Democrats will vote for him simply BECAUSE he&rsquo;s black. It&rsquo;s a way for guilt-ridden whites to show everyone and prove to themselves how righteous and &ldquo;fair&rdquo; they are. This phenomenon often occurs in high school elections for student body president. I offer my nephew&rsquo;s highly regarded private high school as an example: The school is 70% white and less than 10% black. The rest is roughly a 2 to 1 ratio of Latinos to Asians. A black student has been voted president in 4 of the last 5 years. It&rsquo;s my understanding that this is not uncommon in similar high schools across the country.</p>

<p>What you say is unfortunately true. I read other message groups, blogs etc that are not overtly political, i.e. concerned with music or other interest I have and you would not believe the liberal, self loathing guilt that emanates from these people-white people who probably live a fairly segregated life. The TNR Ron Paul attack was posted on one site I frequent. Ron Paul had attracted some interest as an anti-war candidate but after just the hint of racism implied in that hatchet piece led these liberals fools to double over in self serving attacks on Dr. Paul. </p>
<p>It is an example of the difficult road we face in righting wrongs in our country. </p>

			<p>The bottom line here is that either we White Americans make up our minds and TAKE our country back   &mdash;   kicking out the unwanted immigrants, or we reconcile ourselves to deservedly losing it!</p>
<p>Time to put the gray matter in gear and start THINKING! For starters, forcing an HONEST ELECTION   &mdash;   by creating an Internet database with your name, voter ID number. Then the day AFTER election day, stating HOW you voted. A week later, using this data to show/claim fraud and vote stealing. Even our controlled media would love it. If a hundred million White voters would sign a notarized affidavit stating how they voted and DEMANDING a recount!</p>
<p>Sort of holding the polticians&rsquo; feet to the fire, by preventing YOUR VOTE from being stolen or misdirected! These electronic voting machines CAN be &#8216;fixed&rsquo; to misregister votes. Don&rsquo;t you think the political hacks WANT that flaw in today&rsquo;s voting machine system?</p>
<p>Bush stole the presidency in 2000 with the connivance of Florida&rsquo;s governor, Brother Jeb, and his stooge of an attorney general. Then four years later, by the Ohio scandal.</p>
<p>We need to think up a scheme to prevent the same think in November   &mdash;   TIME IS RUNNING OUT!</p>

			<p>Hillary Clinton is certainly not the only BAD candidate running for the presidency. She and Obama are just the Democrat panderers. You might want to read this story on today&rsquo;s MSN NESWS spotlighting Giuliani (a favorite of Prez. G.W.B.). Here&rsquo;s the link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22776911/" rel="nofollow">https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22776911/</a></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;While in office, Republican&rsquo;s toughness edged toward ruthlessness</p>
<p>Rudolph W. Giuliani likens himself to a boxer who never takes a punch without swinging back. As mayor, he made the vengeful roundhouse an instrument of government, clipping anyone who crossed him.</p>
<p>You can imagine what he&rsquo;d be like in the White House. If you thought Richard M. Nixon was bad, Giuliani would be about ten times worse&hellip; for decent, HONEST people.</p>
<p>We Americans need new blood in the White House. We neither need nor want the business as usual political hacks   &mdash;   Clinton, Obama, Giuliani, McCain   &mdash;   who either would sell America out to buy votes, or use the White House to attack and bludgeon perceived enemies.</p>
<p>Get active. Get Ron Paul in the White House. If you want to know WHY the media hates him&hellip; it&rsquo;s BECAUSE THEY CAN&rsquo;T FIND ANY DIRT TO STICK ON HIM!</p>

I recall meeting a Canadian from Western Canada (Alberta), who mentioned to me that the sole black student in his high school was also the most popular student in the school and was voted class president.</p>

			<p> Most of those who live a lilly white existence have no idea . I graduated in &#8216;71 from an 87% black public school in the South . In two of my classes I was the only white in there, even the teacher was black . Can you imagine the effect of nearly forty years of this on the minds of young whites ?  It&rsquo;s hopeless .</p>

<p>Heap the blame where it belongs: Firstly on the Hollywood Propaganda Machine, secondly on our controlled media. Both actively trying to make black perceived as white and white as black   &mdash;   NO PUN intended.</p>
<p>That so-called contribution by Blacks to music   &mdash;   rap music   &mdash;   if you can call it that. The constant brainwashing our young people are exposed to   &mdash;   from cradle onwards. Even kiddie cartoons showing racial mixing. The subsequent peer pressure in their teens   &mdash;   to have sex with non-Whites in order to be cool.</p>
<p>Why do you thing we have the occasional posts on this and other sides, predicting an inevitable race-based civil war? Given that all logic points to that solution as being the only way to undo or rectify the collossal damage misguided liberal thinking has caused.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s hard to imagine. I sympathize.  I went to high-school in Rochester (NY).  There were NO blacks in the school at all. None. In another nearby high-school, there may have been 4 or 5.  Nobody would have been unkind or rude to them. Absolutely not!  There just weren&rsquo;t any, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>In all those years of grade-school and high-school, I never had a black school mate.  I don&rsquo;t feel &#8220;deprived&#8221; because of the lack of it. I didn&rsquo;t encounter them until entering the working world.  In fact, like all Northerners, we liked blacks and thought well of them   &mdash;    we just never knew any!</p>
<p>That was some years ago. I imagine it&rsquo;s greatly changed now. I wouldn&rsquo;t even want to know.</p>
