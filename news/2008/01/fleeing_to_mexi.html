						<p>A methamphetamine dealer who gunned down a deputy during a traffic stop in Southern California. A man in Arizona who killed his ex-girlfriend&rsquo;s parents and brother and snatched his children. A man who suffocated his baby daughter and left her body in a toolbag on an expressway overpass near Chicago.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, these would be death penalty cases. But these men fled to Mexico, thereby escaping the possibility of execution.</p>
<p>The reason: Mexico refuses to send anyone back to the United States unless the U.S. gives assurances it won&rsquo;t seek the death penalty &mdash; a 30-year-old policy that rankles some American prosecutors and enrages victims&rsquo; families.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find it extremely disturbing that the Mexican government would dictate to us, in Arizona, how we would enforce our laws at the same time they are complaining about our immigration laws,&#8221; said Barnett Lotstein, special assistant to the prosecutor in Maricopa County, Ariz., which includes Phoenix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even in the most egregious cases, the Mexican authorities say, &lsquo;No way,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s not justice. That&rsquo;s an interference of Mexican authorities in our judicial process in Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico routinely returns fugitives to the U.S. to face justice. But under a 1978 treaty with the U.S., Mexico, which has no death penalty, will not extradite anyone facing possible execution. To get their hands on a fugitive, U.S. prosecutors must agree to seek no more than life in prison.</p>
<p>Other countries, including France and Canada, also demand such &#8220;death assurances.&#8221; But the problem is more common with Mexico, since it is often a quick drive from the crime scene for a large portion of the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can get to Mexico &mdash; if you have the means &mdash; it&rsquo;s a way of escaping the death penalty,&#8221; said Issac Unah, a University of North Carolina political science professor.</p>

			<p>This is not good news for us.  Mexico won&rsquo;t willingly deport him because of our death penalty, so if they ever find him, they won&rsquo;t give him up without concessions.  And I fear those concessions will involve amnesty for illegal aliens, along with no death penalty.</p>

			<p>It is my understanding that Mexico, Europe and the UN not only oppose the death penalty but endorse a maximum twenty-year sentence regardless of crime. </p>

			<p>For the past few years we&rsquo;ve watched numerous cases come and go, Emily Sander, Dani Countrymen, Emily Goodwynn, and now the Marine debacle. It&rsquo;s just pathetic. When white girls won&rsquo;t have sex with them, they rape them, murder them, and flee to Mexico. The other trend involvled is how the MSM slanders the victims. Now Chertoff says, we must &#8220;grow up&#8221; and accept Orwellian ID cards to stop the invasion. Forcing Americans who go surfing in Rosarito to get biometric ID isn&rsquo;t going to slow the tide of illegals any more than detaining little old ladies from Duluth carrying nail clippers on a plane is going to stop terrorism. Our supposedly elected officials just continue to take away our civil liberties while dancing around the problems they claim to be trying to fix. </p>

			<p>Remember these cases when someone tells you that it is unthinkable to deport millions of illegal Mexicans because these tumbleweeds have put down &#8220;roots&#8221; here. They are here only because it is convenient, and when it is no longer convenient, they will leave and never shed a tear. </p>
<p>These people have thousands of years of roots in Mexico, and if that does not matter to them, then why should their five or ten years of &#8220;roots&#8221; in the US matter to us? </p>

<p>We are not without effective means of retaliation,  retaliation that would bring Mexico around very quickly.   We hold some powerful cards in our hand   &mdash;   if only our pathetic politicians dared use them.  In fact, we occupy the dominant position. But you&rsquo;d never guess it! Instead we see the constant spectacle of the lion appeasing the mouse.  Why?</p>
<p>For example:  We could put a tax on remittances to Mexico;  or we could threaten to suspend them entirely; we could put a tax on tourism (Americans to Mexico); we could charge a heavy border-crossing tax (some countries [Chile] charge $100.)  </p>
<p>Any of these measures would cause economic havoc in Mexico. They would dry up the flow of US dollars into that country.  The authorities there would very quickly see the light. In fact, you wouldn&rsquo;t have to enact any of these measures.  Merely the threat of it would do the trick quite nicely.  Why are our politicians so gutless?  </p>

			<p>No, I believe the Mexicans will hand over a gringo facing the death penalty in the US, they just won&rsquo;t hand over a Mexican citizen who faces the death penalty for a crime committed in the US. The Mexicans are also now squawking about handing over their fellow citizens for crimes committed in the US if they face a life sentence saying that this is &#8220;cruel&#8221;. My answer to this problem is that we start emptying our prisons of our most murderous and depraved criminals and give them a plane ride to Mexico city and refuse to take them back. </p>

			<p>In a nutshell because of our screwed up laws and the traitors who created them, Mexican crmininals escape justice while American criminals pay. Interesting how illegal immigration affects every type of American. The innocent and the criminal.</p>

			<p>This is nothing new and not unique to Mexico. The European Union, Australia and New Zealand also will not return fugitives to countries with the death penalty - unless assurances are given that the death penalty will not be applied.</p>

<p>Yes but people from those countries aren&rsquo;t breaking into ours by the millions, killing our citizens and then running back across the border.</p>

Well, nowadays some are. There was that Zacarias Moussaouri, for instance.    I wouldn&rsquo;t personally consider him to be a &#8220;Frenchman&#8221;,  but unfortunately, the French government  did. They considered him &#8220;French&#8221; based on the technicality that he was born there; and they defended him.</p>

			<p>One option is to lie to Mexican authorities, and sentence criminals to death upon their return.  When dealing with Mexicans I see no reason for honesty as they are dishonest anyway.</p>

			<p>Cesar Lorean, whom our tax dollars paid to learn how to kill and evade, has now killed a fellow Marine and her unborn child, and has gone into hiding, presumably back to Mejico. <br>
Anyone for a  a &#8220;shoot on sight&#8221; law for murderous immigrants?</p>

			<p>Mexico has one of the most corrupt governments in the world. They desperately need the death penalty. If they would start executing their corrupt goverment officials and the Drug Lords that are in league with them, they just might do something for their poor people instead of shipping them to our country to deal with. I for one am sick and tire of a third rate country dictating what the U.S. can and cannot do!</p>

<p>Wrong. That won&rsquo;t work.  After one such incident, they won&rsquo;t return any others. <br>
They may be crooked, but do you think they are stupid?</p>

			<p>Cesar Lorean was born in Mexico; ergo his is, and always will be, a Mexican regardless of his immigration status.  The American female marine he raped and later murdered was I believe his &#8220;roommate&#8221;.  One has to question the young white woman&rsquo;s intelligence at choosing a Mexican male as a &#8220;roommate&#8221;, just as one has to acknowledge that the outcome to such an arrangement was entirely predictable&hellip;             </p>

If that&rsquo;s really so, then I have to question also the intelligence of the Marine Corps to be allowing such things!!   What in the world is going on there?  </p>
