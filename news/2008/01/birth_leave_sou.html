						<p>Pregnant students in a Denver high school are asking for at least four weeks of maternity leave so they can heal, bond with their newborns and not be penalized with unexcused absences.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two counselors from East High School approached the school board last month, saying the policy at their school is unfair and inconsiderate because it forces new moms to return to school the day after being discharged from the hospital or face being charged with unexcused absences.</p>
<p>Kayla Lewis, who is five months pregnant and a senior at East, requested that the board establish maternity leave for students at a Dec. 20 public hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;After you have the baby, your body needs time to heal,&#8221; the 18-year-old said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;To just assume that two days after having a baby they can go back to school is ridiculous at best,&#8221; Grope [Dr. Sarah Grope, pediatrician at HealthOne&rsquo;s Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children in Denver] said. &#8220;During that time, they should be able to do their schoolwork and give time to bond with their children.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Denver has one of the highest teen-pregnancy rates in the state. Of every 1,000 girls ages 15 to 17, 54.5 will become pregnant in the city, compared with 24.3 throughout Colorado, according to state health statistics.</p>
<p>The district has a school for pregnant teens and new moms, Florence Crittenton School, but it has a waiting list. Plus, many students want to remain at the school where they started, said Head, the counselor at East.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several districts have special schools with child-care services for new moms. Others have programs that allow students to receive high-school credit.</p>
<p>{snip}based credit-recovery program that students can use during evening hours.</p>
<p>Douglas County has had a program for 19 years called WINGS, or Winning in New Growth Situations, that offers support and instruction for the girls once a week, allowing them to earn elective credits in nutrition and parenting. The program has 20 students, said coordinator Susan Anderson.</p>
<p>The district has a school that begins at 4:30 p.m. for new parents that is attached to Highlands Ranch High School. Students also are able to stay in their schools, but that is not easy for many new moms, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Teen mothers face a challenging future, with many dropping out. A third of teen moms receive their high-school diplomas and 1.5 percent get college degrees before they turn 30, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students at one high school in southern Colorado wanted to set up a child-care center, but the principal forbade it, saying it would encourage teen pregnancy, she said.</p>

					<p>And don&rsquo;t forget the &#8220;father&#8221;!</p>
<p>He needs about four weeks to bond with the baby, another four weeks to get acquainted with the mother, perhaps learn her name, and then he should be guaranteed a job in the six-figure range so he can provide in a manly manner.</p>
<p>Or maybe they should just raise our taxes so we can provide for this lovely lady and her baby. The father, too.</p>
<p>We are so loving; such a loving people, full of good works.  </p>

					<p>I am doubled over with laughter right now, because neither I, nor anyone else should seriously believe that this &#8220;woman&#8221; is actually going to raise her own child! We all know that the girl&rsquo;s mother, grandmother, and possibly even great-grandmother, in addition to aunts, and female cousins are going to take care of the baby, and this girl is going to go right back to doing the things that got her pregnant in the first place. </p>
<p>Whatever happened to shaming? This girl needs a hard lesson in the social history of teen pregnancy.</p>

					<p>I had a baby in September and could not imagine going back to work the day after I got home. If these girls are really serious about their education then they should try to do some sort of home study or <span class="caps">GED </span>study. The real answer would be to not get pregnant in high school.</p>

					<p>I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s wrong with that. Women at work get maternity leaves, so why shouldn&rsquo;t students?</p>
<p>How does maternity leaves encourage teen pregnancy?</p>

					<p>It just goes to show where their priorties are - sex before education.  They are so use to getting it all. So these sex-crazed animals get all kinds of benefits while the good kids go unrewarded. In Baltimore, the 30 something grandmothers always raise these kids&rsquo; kids while the young mamas get their <span class="caps">GED </span>so that they can go to college and become doctors!</p>

					<p>I love how the journalist deftly side-steps the fact that:<br>
&#8220;Most teenaged mothers are non-white.&#8221;</p>
<p>You want to have children as a teenager, that&rsquo;s okay by me - just don&rsquo;t expect everyone to &#8220;support&#8221; your bastard offspring.</p>

<p>And school credit for nutrition and parenting?  <span class="caps">WHAT</span>??<br>
Taxpayers shouldn&rsquo;t be paying for their daycare, either.</p>
<p>These girls should be discouraged from making another mistake, <span class="caps">NOT </span>rewarded.  Yes, make life as hard as possible!  Why make it a viable option, like just another life choice?<br>
If their life turns out to be a miserable existence, that&rsquo;s not altogether a bad thing.  They will serve as an example of what <span class="caps">NOT </span>to do (for other girls), and perhaps their children will decide that they don&rsquo;t want to grow up and be like Mommy.</p>

					<p>Back when I was in high school, a girl that got pregnant was shunned and ostrasized, which was probably the best form of birth control. Now tax payers are going to forking over money for day care for illegitimate kids of teenagers. 20 years ago this would have been inconceivable. Where&rsquo;s the money coming from, the baby daddy? She&rsquo;s probably already on welfare. We are condoning kids ruining thier lives, at taxpayer expense.</p>

					<p>Yeah, dem chilluns needs time to bond wif they babies.  After all, de white oppressor is responsible for their condition, right? Expecting them to finish high school, get a job and maybe even get married before having babies is &#8216;acting&rsquo; white, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s like blaming the victim.  Let them have the time off so they can do they bonding and watch Oprah for a few weeks.  The school should hire baby sitters for them too, along with tutors to keep them up with they studies.  </p>

<p>PincheGabacho, you got that right. I was a teenager in the fifties. You better believe we girls thought about that. What would our parents say? What would my friends say? What would they say about me at school? If I had gotten pregnant my father would probably have shipped me off to a convent and my reputation would have been ruined. Shunning was a very effective way to keep young girls in line. By today&rsquo;s standards it sounds harsh, but it worked. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying all girls were saints in those days, but my guess is that the majority of girls who married were either virgins or had only slept with their would-be husbands. Getting pregnant out of wedlock in those days had bad consequences and society was the better for it.<br>

					<p>So now this subsidized population displacement (of native-born Whites, of course) is happening in Colorado, just like it&rsquo;s overtaken the rest of the Southwest.  This is old hat in California and Arizona  &mdash;   if anything, there&rsquo;s direct encouragement of teen pregnancies by local authorities to push the White population to minority status even faster.  The Corrupt Classes know who&rsquo;s buttering their bread, and they can&rsquo;t wait to have a Latin American style Hourglass Society  &mdash;   with a tiny elite kept rich and afloat by a massive underclass and little to no middle class  &mdash;   as opposed to the annoying White &#8220;Burgher&#8221; society which actually values things like community and shared sacrifice.</p>
<p>Again, it bears repeating  &mdash;   if you live in a Third-Worldizing state that is becoming White minority and where we are increasingly powerless  &mdash;   California (especially California), New York, Arizona, New Mexico, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan  &mdash;   please do as many others of us soon-to-be-ex Californians are doing, and move your family to a White-majority Swing state, which is our only chance to consolidate political power, stop the Clintons in 2008 with their plans to inundate White communities in Red States with Third World &#8220;diversity migrants,&#8221; and preserve some remnant of our society in North America.  The added benefits are a lower cost of living, and a more Western, European environment for our kids.</p>
<p>The states we need to concentrate in: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Delaware, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Ohio, New Jersey and Idaho.  And I&rsquo;ll repeat, for those of you who&rsquo;ve been emigrating to your &#8220;ancestral homelands&#8221; in European countries like Germany, Italy and Scandinavia  &mdash;   while this is not something I&rsquo;d consider myself, I can respect your decision.  But please, take note that events in the 2008 election affect you out there as well.  The Clintons hate Western civilization anywhere, and Europe is a target for them (with an advocated Turkey accession to the EU) after they&rsquo;re finished ruining Western society in North America.  Even if you spend every day now speaking and raising your kids in German or Italian, register to vote in US elections  &mdash;   you have that right for many years after leaving the country, and you must maintain that connection, for all our sakes whatever side of the Atlantic we&rsquo;re on!</p>

					<p>Teen pregnancy and out-of-wedlock birth used to be stigmatized, but that ended in the late 1960&rsquo;s era of the &#8216;rights of the individual&rsquo; and the extension of welfare benefits to single mothers.</p>
<p>The unintended consequence of the destigmatization of teen motherhood and single mother welfare has been the rise in births of children who are born to teen or unwed mothers, to a greater degree among blacks and hispanics. </p>
<p>Becoming a single mother, with the state paying your bills, is now an acceptable lifestyle choice, socially and financially, thanks to decisions made forty years ago.    </p>

					<p><i>it forces new moms to return to school the day after being discharged from the hospital or face being charged with unexcused absences.</i></p>
<p>I think they should let them stay at home as an excused absence. When I remember my state of mind and body after the birth of my son (in my early thirties) I don&rsquo;t think the girls would learn much, regardless of their racial, social and marital status. Their body is programmed on something completely else in that time period.</p>

					<p>Not only should they not get maternity leave, but the law should be used to remove the children from mothers not equipped to raise them and prosecute the men who impregnated underage girls. A free education was never intended to include IN <span class="caps">EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE.</span> It needs to return to the standard structure - if you attend, behave, speak English, and study and try to learn. All others should be making private arrangements at their own expense - not the taxpayers!</p>
<p>This just illustrates how society has replaced the role of husband for minorities. 70% of blacks born are illegitimate because life is easier with aid for dependent children compared to two people trying to work and juggle marriage, children, and bills.</p>

					<p>The end goal of the left is to set up as many unmarried girls as possible as baby mills, supported by the government. That way more babies can be born outside of marriage, and the government can get its marxist hands on them at an earlier age.<br>
This also serves another goal: tearing down the institution of marriage.<br><br>
Leftists know what they are doing.</p>

					<p>Actually, in 2000, I worked as a substitute teacher at a special high school in Denver, just for pregnant girls. Those in my class were all hispanic. A public nurse came to check on everyone&rsquo;s health. I remember thinking how I – whitey – was the only one in the room with no medical care. One girl informed me, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t do no work.&#8221; I ended up kicking her out of the class. An administrator then came and kicked me out: the pregnant girls were supposed to chill out all day. <br>

					<p>I must be missing something here. <span class="caps">WHY </span>should teenagers have to get themselves pregnant to begin with? No, I am not naive enough to expect abstinence. But with birth control means universally available?  </p>
<p>This bad joke is really on society. As in the <span class="caps">AMERICAN TAXPAYER, </span>who ultimately foots not only the hospital bills, but the interminable welfare checks until the children are 18.</p>
<p>Sure, you expect this kind of craziness from Blacks and Mexicans. But at least <span class="caps">MOST</span> White girls will take precautions. At least those with above moron-level intelligence.<br>

As I&rsquo;ve said before, only a very rich society    &mdash;   and hitherto a very secure one   &mdash;    could afford to lavish this kind of  indulgence on its social pathologies.  Or engage in Marxist social-engineering experiments.</p>
<p>All traditional societies, down through history, have frowned on and penalized childbirth outside of marraiage.  There was good reason. Were our ancestors all bigots and fools?</p>
<p>Like wealthy playboys and heiresses squandering a trust fund, we&rsquo;ve been living off the gains of two world wars, and the benefits of our past inventiveness and productivity,  our vast open spaces, and  our previous isolation in the world.  Plus our once-high ratio of resources to population.   All formerly so.</p>
<p>But&hellip;  How long are we going to be able to keep up this lavish lifestyle?   How long can we keep pampering and indulging our least productive elements?  America is declining. We are losing our industry, technology, capital, jobs. The dollar is plummeting, our debt is massive, and the population is soaring   &mdash;    while simultaneously becoming dumber, browner and more dependent.  Somewhere down the road, there is going to be a reckoning.  At some point, people are going to have to face harsh reality. That  eventual crisis, when it comes,  will be a bitter experience for a great many.  When the governmental umbilical cord is cut, the spoiled  Kaylas and Keishas and LaTeeshas (and their baby-daddies)  may not be able to cope.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve probably said so many times here, 20-30-40 years ago, this stuff today would all have seemed like wild fantasy, the sheerest fiction.</p>

					<p>[No one]should seriously believe that this &ldquo;woman&rdquo; is actually going to raise her own child!   We all know that the girl&rsquo;s mother, grandmother, and possibly even great-grandmother, in addition to aunts, and female cousins are going to take care of the baby, and this girl is going to go right back to doing the things that got her pregnant in the first place. <br>

That is very true. In the places where I&rsquo;ve worked, the black mothers hardly ever raised their own kids.  (And the black fathers were long gone and completely out of sight.)</p>

&#8220;Women at work get maternity leaves, so why shouldn&rsquo;t students?</p>
<p>How does maternity leaves encourage teen pregnancy?&#8221;<br>

<p>So by your logic female students would want to have babies because they can stay home for a few weeks? Sure that sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>I bet that all of these students never even had such an idea in mind when they got themselves pregnant. Have a kid so you can miss some school, you are being overly cynical of people. It&rsquo;s unfortunate for these kids to have a child at that age, some of you are not helping them get past the time but are treating them as outcasts.</p>
<p>For all of you who don&rsquo;t agree with this:<br>
This has nothing to do with race, because it applies to all students. Why don&rsquo;t men get &#8220;paternal&#8221; leaves? Because they didn&rsquo;t give birth to a baby and lose a whole lot of blood and suffer from postpartum depression. If a women got terribly sick because she had to go to school after child birth then that is just Medieval brutality.</p>

You can&rsquo;t have it all! Sometimes for some things, there shouldn&rsquo;t be an &#8216;out clause&rsquo;. I know this isn&rsquo;t biblical times. But, learning to be responsible, for yourself or for society, was never a bad idea. </p>

<p>I have no idea what you are saying in reply to a previous poster. But if a girl wants to get pregnant that&rsquo;s her business just don&rsquo;t force others to adjust to her and her problems. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ostracize such a person but I wouldn&rsquo;t want to associate with them. It would be better if they finished school with others girls like her on their or their parents money. If no money, abortion. If they are not smart enough to plan their lives better, let them go to trade school and prepare to care for their usually fatherless child. Just don&rsquo;t ask me to pay with my money for your mistakes.  </p>

					<p>When you have a kid in his 20&rsquo;s who won&rsquo;t leave the coop, it&rsquo;s usually b/c the parents are making life too easy for him. Why should he leave when Mom makes dinner, Dad pays his car insurance, Mom does his laundry, etc? You make it as uncomfortable as possible so he&rsquo;ll <span class="caps">WANT </span>to leave home.</p>
<p>These girls who get knocked up in high school (or worse, junior high school) do not need to be babied any more than they already are. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already so easy for them that they&rsquo;re not encouraged to give the child up for adoption. They get government assistance, food stamps, free medical care, free child care, etc. so they figure hey, having a baby is easy. So they make even more demands   &mdash;   maternity leave!</p>

No, not at all.  It&rsquo;s just that  [whether you approve of her baby or not]  you can&rsquo;t expect a woman who&rsquo;s just given birth yesterday to be sitting in a classroom today. She&rsquo;s not in any physical condition for it. And in that shape she won&rsquo;t learn anything anyway.</p>
<p><br>
Maybe you&rsquo;d like to send her back to school the very same day?<br><br>

					<p>Someone here said that the fathers should be prosecuted for impregnating underaged girls.  I wonder how many of these men are in and out of jail all of the time for all kinds of stuff.  Since inmates are often paid little sums of money for work done inside prison, the State certainly knows how to collect the child support.  That is much better than allowing inmates children to live on welfare on the outside while daddy is being fed and obtaining medical care at State expense on the inside.</p>

<p>They found a quarter of heart attack victims waited 50 minutes or more before seeing a doctor in 2004. Waits for all types of emergency department visits became 36 percent longer between 1997 and 2004, the team at Harvard Medical School reported.&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The above quote was from a news story today on <span class="caps">MSN NEWS.</span> . . I couldn&rsquo;t resist printing a part of it. Particularly, given the ugly reality hospital ER rooms are literally <span class="caps">CLOGGED </span>with illegal immigrants and their families demanding (and getting) <span class="caps">FREE </span>(as in tax-payer funded) healthcare. Leastways in Texas and most assuredly in California, from what friends tell me.</p></p>
