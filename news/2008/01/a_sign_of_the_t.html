						<i>Peter Bronson, Tucson Citizen, January 2, 2008</i></font> 
					</div>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A snapshot on his Web site shows Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones with his hands on his hips, standing between a creosote bush and a cholla cactus, with the rugged sepia-brown mountains of southern Arizona in the background.</p>
<p>He was a long way from home at his own expense to make a point: The border is closer than we think.</p>
<p>In Cochise County, south of Tucson, 300 people are caught crossing the border illegally every 24 hours, Jones learned during an October visit. But Border Patrol officers told him that more than 1,000 slip past every day. And some wind up in the Butler County Jail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He cites a Quinnipiac poll showing that more than 80 percent of Ohio opposes driver&rsquo;s licenses and welfare or health benefits for illegal immigrants. Two-thirds want a fence on the Mexican border. National polls are just as lopsided. The people &#8220;get it,&#8221; but the political and media elites don&rsquo;t, Jones says.</p>
<p>They argue for amnesty, driver&rsquo;s licenses, health care benefits and welfare for illegal immigrants, who they say only want a better life for their families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At home in Butler County, he has seen cocaine, marijuana and crystal meth from Mexico increase. &#8220;A 100-pound bust of marijuana used to be a big thing. It&rsquo;s not anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When anybody comes into our jail, they are asked if they are a U.S. citizen, and they are asked for a Social Security number. If the answer is no to either one, that sets off a signal and we notify ICE.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six ICE agents working out of a Butler County Jail office cover southwest Ohio. And each month they deport 40 to 50 people. At jail costs of $55 per day for each prisoner, that adds up to a monthly bill of more than $80,000.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a drop in the overflowing bucket, the sheriff says. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a mess. It&rsquo;s getting worse and now it&rsquo;s starting to get more violent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones has put up billboards to protest the problem, fought with and billed the federal government, and gone on radio and TV nationwide to demand federal and state help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody has to do something,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This isn&rsquo;t Texas or Arizona, but it&rsquo;s becoming that way. They&rsquo;re now moving to the inner part of the country where the jobs are.&#8221;</p>
<p>He favors increasing legal immigration, but says illegal immigrants cause problems besides crime: reduced wages, exploited workers, public health problems and the economic drain of wages sent south of the border. A backlash against people here illegally causes unfair suspicion of all Hispanics.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He favors increasing legal immigration&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Absolutely not.  At over 1 million a year, legal immigration is just as big a part of the problem as illegal.  Violence, drugs, crime, balkanization, incredible costs to taxpayers are caused just as much by legal immigrants as they are illegals.</p>
<p>The myth is that, well meaning whites are against illegal immigration but for legal immigration.  That&rsquo;s bull-ony.  Everyone I know, knows the score with immigrants and wants them gone, legal, illegal, whatever.  And those that don&rsquo;t, want immigrants to not be allowed things like welfare, at all, ever, and to have their citizenship revoked immediately if they engage in crime.</p>
<p>The only major candidate this election who plans to cut legal, as well as illegal immigration, is Fred Thompson.  And that includes Ron Paul, who, other than a vague reference to not allowing these people welfare, is curiously silent about the issue.</p>

			<p>Is anyone  else sick and tired of hearing &#8220;they just came here for a better life&#8221;? When did this suddenly become such a noble pursuit? I&rsquo;ve never veiwed opportunists&rsquo; as being noble, just the opposite in fact. sneaking into another country to take advantage of that society is not noble. the next time I&rsquo;m caught burglarizing a home, I&rsquo;m going to pull the &#8220;but officer, I just wanted a better life&#8221; card out</p>

			<p>I must be older than I thought&hellip;  Years ago, I learned in school about the growth of the country- manifest destiny &amp; expansion from coast to coast. It was considered a good thing, the path to this country&rsquo;s greatness. </p>
<p>Since when did it become a point of proper American thinking to desire to cede territory to the people of other nations?</p>

I have predicted all along that Fred Thompson will win the presidency.  His impressive performance in Iowa tonight has only solidified by opinion.</p>
<p>That said, Ron Paul is still the best candidate overall in terms of true liberty and sovereignty.  He has repeatedly and explicitly stated that we need to cut off welfare for illegals, and has spoken out against NAFTA, CAFTA, and other globalist &#8220;free-trade&#8221; scams.  Duncan Hunter has also expressed similar sentiments.</p>
<p>I will say that Fred Thompson is better than the other neocons, though, and he does have a loyal band of followers.  Hence, I predict that he will be our next president.</p>

			<p>There is a little story about the arab, camel and tent.</p>
<p>It was cold outside in the desert and the camel  wanted to put his nose in the tent, so the arab said ok, then the camel wanted to put his head in the tent, so the arab said ok&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;well to make a long story short, the camel ended up inside the tent and the arab was outside.</p>
<p>In our case the US European is the arab and the foreigners are the camel.</p>
<p>Kiss the good life goodbye fools.</p>

			<p>ICE is a joke.  The Border Patrol agents are being used as pawn by the worthless FED Gov. They are getting attacked everyday and nothing being done about it.  I feel sorry for them. They have been abandoned by the very people they work for. Homeland Security is a joke all set up to be a diversionary tatic to stonewall the coming of the New World Order and Global Gov, ramrodded by El-Presidente Jorge Bush-o!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see that he is taking some action. It is odd though that a sheriff in the Midwest would take the time to have immigration come to his jail and so many other sheriffs in our heavily infested states don&rsquo;t. Hispanics seem to be like Blacks, when they cross a threshold in community people turn silent and plan on moving &#8220;away&#8221;.</p>
<p>You can move away from them but they will just have more children, often at your expense.</p>

<p>Third world immigration, even if legal, causes these same problems. The truth is we need to do away with ALL illegal immigration and have these people removed from our country. We also need to stop all legal immigration from the 3rd world. We&rsquo;ve already had enough. We need to severely reduce legal immigration to people NOT from 3rd world countries who are educated, self-supporting and have some type of skill, such as scientific or medical, that will benefit the US.</p>

			<p>@ 7:14PM,</p>
<p>Exactly where does Thompson propose cutting legal immigration? His website states:</p>
<p><i><b>The United States is a nation of immigrants.</b> We must continue to welcome immigrants and foreign workers who come to our country legally, giving priority to those who can advance the nation&rsquo;s interests and common good. Immigrants and foreign workers who play by the rules <b>need to be rewarded with faster and less burdensome service</b>, not delays that last years. Advancing the following initiatives will require close cooperation between all levels of government, the business community, and concerned citizens.</i></p>
<p>As for Ron Paul, he does (unfortunately) support legal immigration, but he does so with restrictions: </p>
<p><i>&#8220;I think it depends on our economy. If we have a healthy economy, I think we could be very generous on work programs&hellip; I think the economy is going downhill. People are feeling pinched &mdash; in the middle, much more pinched than the government is willing to admit.&#8221;</i> - VDARE Interview with Peter Brimelow, 9/12/07</p>
<p>Ron Paul&rsquo;s enforcement plan   &mdash;   denying immigrants the ability to work and recieve government services (school, medical service, welfare, housing, food stamps)   &mdash;   is only part of his greater plan: erecting a border fence, reinterpreting the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s &#8216;citizenship clause,&rsquo; and enforcing visa rules (to prevent people from overstaying and crashing planes into buildings).</p>
<p>But why pick Paul over Thompson? </p>
<p>Thompson is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, which according to historian Carroll Quigley (late professor of history at Georgetown and former mentor of Bill Clinton): <i>&#8220;The CFR is the American Branch of a society which originated in England, and which believes that national boundaries should be obliterated, and a one-world rule established.&#8221;</i> Other candidates on both parties are also members of this organization.</p>
<p>Paul would like us to regain national sovereignty by withdrawing from the UN, NAFTA, CAFTA, the WTO, the IMF, and all the other alphabet organizations that strip the U.S. of its ability to make its own decisions.</p>

<p>That said, Ron Paul is still the best candidate overall in terms of true liberty and sovereignty. He has repeatedly and explicitly stated that we need to cut off welfare for illegals, and has spoken out against NAFTA, CAFTA, and other globalist &ldquo;free-trade&rdquo; scams. Duncan Hunter has also expressed similar sentiments.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In my opinion, neither candidate performed acceptably in the Iowa primary, unfortunately, but for different reasons.  Thompson has simply not been working hard enough to get elected.  I don&rsquo;t know his problem is, but he better buckle down, and soon.</p>
<p>Paul, on the other hand, has a far more serious problem.  The fringe of his supporters don&rsquo;t know how to keep their mouths shut and they are ruining his reputation.  And it&rsquo;s really starting to anger me.  Paul should be doing far better than he is, but every time a Troofer, Nazi, or &#8220;new world order&#8221; fanatic shows up, they embarrass him.  Mostly, he&rsquo;s ignored them, but lately, I see him having to defend himself from criticism over it.  If these people don&rsquo;t stop, and I mean, right now, he&rsquo;s finished.</p>
<p>This is a problem.  With implication far beyond Paul&rsquo;s candidacy.  Many politicians know the score with regard to race.  They would like to do something about it but are worried about killing their careers.  When people act the fool and it hurts a candidate like Paul, the others take notice of it.  They become less likely to make the hard decisions based on racial reality and more likely to cover their asses.  Worse.  Far worse.  Is if the issue is successfully used to destroy candidates.  If we don&rsquo;t watch it, we will all be talking about the disasters being caused by President Obama.  And make no mistake, there will be plenty of them.</p>

			<p>In regards to Fred Thompson, I think that he did relatively well, although Mike Huckabee undeniably has major momentum going into South Carolina and Florida.  The Evangelical vote will certainly help Huckabee in the South. </p>

			<p><i>Fred Thompson?!?<i> Fred Thompson is a joke. Just the fact that he starred on that anti-White tv show <i>Law &amp; Order</i> (or as a friend of mine calls it, <i>Flaw &amp; Odor</i>) is reason enough for me not to support him. Also the owner of that awful, so-called &#8220;Republican&#8221; website Free Republic has given his support to Thompson (a site that doesn&rsquo;t allow any articles from Amren.com or VDare.com, and which vilifies true conservatives like Pat Buchanan and Ron Paul).</i></i></p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s good that mexican illegal immigration is spreading. As long as it was in the southwest, nobody in the rest of the country knew or cared. Now that it is coming home to places like Ohio, the rest of the country will get off their rear ends.</p>
