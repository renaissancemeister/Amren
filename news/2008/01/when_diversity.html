<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Initially, Courtney Halligan, a first-year student at the University of Delaware, was not opposed to attending a diversity training session that was required of all incoming freshmen. In fact, the 18-year-old New Jersey native assumed that the experience would be an opportunity for her to learn more about students from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Halligan to change her mind.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In one-on-one and group sessions conducted in the dormitories by resident assistants, Halligan and dozens of other White students complained that they were made to feel like racists. She adds that they were blamed for the legacy of racism that Blacks and other minority groups have endured through the years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I was personally offended,&#8221; says Halligan, who is majoring in communications. &#8220;I was angered when a document was used in the training that stated that &lsquo;all people of European descent are racist.&rsquo; When I attempted to express my opinion against such statements, I was silenced.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to complaints by students like Halligan, and pressure from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a Philadelphia-based civil liberties advocacy group that monitors freedom of speech issues on campuses across the country, the university decided last semester to suspend the controversial program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our concern was not the substance of the program but the way that it was administered,&#8221; says Samantha Harris, director of legal and public advocacy for FIRE. &#8220;It crossed the line from education to indoctrination.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a message to the community that was posted on the school&rsquo;s Web site last November, University of Delaware President Patrick T. Harker explained his rationale for suspending the program. &#8220;There are questions about [the program&rsquo;s] practices that must be addressed, and there are reasons for concern that the actual purpose is not being fulfilled,&#8221; Harker wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The debacle at UD is the latest embarrassing incident in which diversity training has backfired, possibly causing more harm than good and alienating students in the process. Diversity experts point to these examples as cause for college officials across the nation to re-examine and reform their own campus diversity training programs.</p>
<p>The major problem, experts agree, is that there is no uniformity in training, and some individuals who call themselves diversity trainers have received little or no instruction at all in facilitating discussions on sensitive issues such as race, class, gender and sexual orientation. Additionally, no independent agency exists that has the authority to certify or sanction trainers, leaving the task to colleges and universities to weed through résumés to figure out if those applying to conduct the trainings are indeed qualified.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some trainers facilitate around diversity issues with the goal of raising social justice issues, while others may use diversity training to focus on behavior modification or ensuring that a college or university is in compliance with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And even when some colleges contract to bring in a professional trainer, the tactics used by the individual have sometimes caused great concern on campus. For example, in 2006, Wilkes University, located in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., fired the school&rsquo;s multicultural affairs coordinator after a diversity consultant hired to conduct a training session called one student of Indian descent a terrorist. Other students were allegedly made to hurl derogatory slurs at each other in an effort to take away the negative sting of the words.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity training needs to be ongoing. You can&rsquo;t do it one time,&#8221; says Jane Elliott, a diversity trainer who is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;foremother&#8221; of diversity training, in part because of the &#8220;Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes&#8221; exercise that she conducted on a group of third-grade students in the 1960s. This now-famous exercise labeled participants as inferior or superior based solely upon the color of their eyes and exposed them to the experience of being a minority.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happens is that so many colleges do diversity training once a year and they figure that it&rsquo;s taken care of and that they&rsquo;ve done their job,&#8221; says Elliott. &#8220;But we don&rsquo;t teach American literature for one hour and expect students to know it for the rest of their lives. It has to be an ongoing process.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Elliott and others argue that colleges should implement a year-long class where students regularly challenge their own biases in a safe environment that is facilitated by expert trainers and reinforced with readings and lectures.</p>
<p>While some form of diversity training has become common on most college campuses over the last decade, it is often implemented in response to a polarizing incident on campus, like the discovery of a noose, a swastika or anti-gay epithets scribbled across a bathroom stall.</p>

			<p>Yes, just like the brainwashing of 1984 was continuous, so must &#8220;diversity training&#8221;.</p>
<p>If white college students are &#8220;waking up&#8221; to the nonsense that is &#8220;diversity&#8221;, is there still some hope for America?</p>
<p>This AmRener certainly hopes so.</p>

			<p>White students should do one of two things in response to this anti-White indoctrination:  transfer to other schools in droves or have &#8220;sit-ins&#8221; and make a major national protest out of the issue.  In fact White college students nationwide should have an annual White Rights Week in which they have protests and demand that campus &#8220;diversity training&#8221; and other &#8220;Whites are the problem&#8221; brainwashing, cult-like seminars be dropped and banished from campuses.  If they don&rsquo;t suppress this nonsense in school, they will have to deal with it at work.  </p>

			<p>So a politically motivated process of indoctrination which typically yields results opposite to those intended must be a &#8220;life long&#8221; process in order to be effective.  This is like saying that the fact that every time you burn a 100 dollar bill, even thought it makes you poorer, just needs to be done every day for the rest of your life in order to make you rich.</p>
<p>The fact is that diversity training is a business; one which attempts to distort reality for political purposes.  The fact that it does not work reminds me of psycoanalysis.  It begins with highly distorted, non-empirical principles and when it fails to work, it is said that one needs it indefinitely.  This is all very good for the diversity and psycholanalysis businesses but has very little to do with reality(except for the real money they both charge).</p>

			<p>When Diversity Training Goes Awry<br>
The brainswashing must be continuous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity training needs to be ongoing. You can&rsquo;t do it one time&#8221;, says Jane Elliot&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The very method propagandists use is repetition. Repetition is the only method used. Repeat something enough, and whether it is true or false, the mind will finally accept it. As the subheading of the article says, brainwashing IS what it is. I feel it&rsquo;s unnatural and criminal, totally against what an authentic experience should be, and &#8220;authentic experiences&#8221; are what most psychologists believe people need for a healty psyche. Shame on Miss Elliot.</p>

			<p>Interesting stuff here. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned. I wish they would make White students go to this &#8220;diversity training&#8221; every day for two hrs. It wouldn&rsquo;t be long before the diversity training people would be lucky to get off campus with their skins intact. That&rsquo;d be the end of that.</p>

The people who offer this type of training generally have an ax to grind, so it isn&rsquo;t surprising that the content of the training reflects their slightly off-balance psyches. They don&rsquo;t see the dividing line between a basic concept of fairness and their one-sided personal agendas.</p>
<p>The good news is that white students are slowly waking up to the scam, and are complaining. If they keep complaining, the slimy university administrators might decide that it&rsquo;s easier to do away with the programs altogether.<br>

<p>How utterly laughable; quoting this vile old Red gorgon on this topic, is like quoting Heinrich Himmler or Lavrenti Beria on the &ldquo;kinder and gentler&rdquo; aspects of secret police work and making it more acceptable to its victims!</p>
<p>Who the devil does this Comrade Jane Idiot think she is, other than a pioneer in torture; she is also the lowest of them, since she began these &ldquo;psychological&rdquo; exercises of white &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; mongering on innocent children who had done no harm to anyone? It is by her unqualified example, in untrained &ldquo;behavior modification&rdquo; group &ldquo;therapy&rdquo; to cure &ldquo;racism&rdquo; in vulnerable white eight-year-olds, that has allowed for every other untrained: dolt, lout, loon, and buffoon to set up shop as a &ldquo;diversity trainer.&rdquo; That is her &ldquo;legacy,&rdquo; pure and simple; all one needs is a &ldquo;passion&rdquo; for social injustice against whites and brainwashing them to &ldquo;celebrate&rdquo; it, and one is good to go.</p>
<p>Laughably, this paragraph is most telling of that state of affairs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The major problem, experts agree, is that there is no uniformity in training, and some individuals who call themselves diversity trainers have received little or no instruction at all in facilitating discussions on sensitive issues such as race, class, gender and sexual orientation. Additionally, no independent agency exists that has the authority to certify or sanction trainers, leaving the task to colleges and universities to weed through résumés to figure out if those applying to conduct the trainings are indeed qualified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Given what they are doing, one would think that the American Psychological Association (APA) might step up to the plate? After all, &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; and &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; are an ever growing aspect of that behavioral science&rsquo;s nomenclature and &ldquo;research.&rdquo; So much so, that faulty &ldquo;interpretations&rdquo; and &ldquo;inferences&rdquo; are routinely allowed to be drawn as &ldquo;proving&rdquo; such things as &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and &ldquo;white privilege.&rdquo; Also, cognitive and behavioral modifications are the primary objective and dominantly accepted therapeutic method of approaching clinical disorders in the field currently. So why not?</p>
<p>Here is my guess, they know that they would be quickly approaching the Soviet model of psychology, that has been so widely discredited. In such a model, socially or politically held personal thoughts and values, are labeled as being a &ldquo;clinical disorder&rdquo; along the lines of a psychosis at worst and a personality disorder at best. They know, that a field that is already largely misunderstood by the public, would be severely damaging itself by accepting politicized brainwashing techniques that are now handled by only fanatical mavericks, as the trained and licensed clinicians bailiwick. </p>
<p>Indeed, it is one thing to play lip footsy with such nonsense, and quite another to engage in full blown cranial sodomy with it.</p>
<p>Diversity &ldquo;training&rdquo; will never have any form of professional sanction or oversight, simply because it is based on absurd and unnatural politically fashionable assumptions that are not fully quantifiable. Thus, it will remain in the hands of &ldquo;expert&rdquo; incompetents and outright psychopaths, who only have their self-righteous extremism as their guide.</p>
<p>That, no matter how well intentioned, is the road to a utopia called hell! </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

<p>Fair enough.  But diversity is clearly not much of a strength then, since the time used (wasted) to imbibe it is time that could be better spent in more productive actitivities. </p>

			<p>This is not an example of diversity training &#8220;going awry,&#8221; it&rsquo;s an example of it doing exactly what is intended to do   &mdash;   facilitate the cultural dispossession and genocide of whites.  Gen Xers and Yers are the ones victimized by this diversity training, while the crummy boomers order it and direct it.  No wonder X/Y are more right-wing on race.</p>

<p>So they admit, these exercises are being, &#8216;conducted on&rsquo; white children.</p>
<p>&#8220;several colleges mandated diversity training after a series of incidents involving themed parties at which White students dressed up in blackface and partygoers perpetuated racial stereotypes by carrying 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor and wearing Afro wigs, necklaces with large medallions and name tags bearing traditionally Black and Hispanic names&#8221;.</p>
<p>Perhaps these kids should go on TV, as does singer Beyonce in a commercial for direct TV, dancing around half naked, saying, Let me upgrade you, and holding a gold chain in her mouth, reading &#8216;Upgrade&rsquo;. Honest to god, if you have direct TV you&rsquo;ve seen this commercial a million times. The first time I watched it I almost fell out of my chair when she put the &#8216;Upgrade&rsquo; chain in her mouth. Let nothing stand in our way of respecting &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. </p>

			<p>These days, probably it would be a good idea for anyone planning on attending a university to get a lawyer first. That, and take notes on what any of these people tell you, maybe even ask them to sign their signature to what they have just told you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to think that the first duty of any white person is to prepare oneself for litigation.  </p>

			<p>Jane Elliott needs to go to Guantanamo and learn a lesson in diversity herself.  Typical of all Marxists, she grew up in a lily-white area and believes she is an expert on the subject.  She has miraculously gotten others to agree with her.  But, she isn&rsquo;t.  You have to live it to know if it really works and people that live it with their eyes wide open know it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I, personally, can&rsquo;t wait for the blowback.<br>

the blue eyed people be the masters for once. If not, they must<br>
explain why not. Beyond that, they must acknowledge their com-<br>

particular, the Frankfurt School. Once they come clean, America<br>

			<p>I attended Indiana University in the early 1990&rsquo;s.  &#8220;Date Rape&#8221; was the hot issue back then. The &#8220;Take Back the Night&#8221; crowd held vigils on a weekly basis.  They put a posters all over campus that read &#8220;Every Male is a Potential Rapist,&#8221; and behind that slogan had randomly pulled and printed various male names from the student phone directory.  My name showed up on that list.  I was a freshman and still a virgin at that time (sad but true).  My old man was a former president of the alumni association, as well an accomplished attorney who had received his degree from the same beloved institution.  I informed him of the libel that was taking place on not only my name, but his, and within a 24 hour period, all posters were taken down and a public apology was issued to all the young men &#8220;indicted&#8221; on said posters and that was that.  Is their anything more dishonest than politcal correctness?</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s shocking that there isn&rsquo;t MORE opposition to this racist brainwashing.</p>
<p>&hellip;Also of interest is the fact that there is almost no scholarly work being done on this diversity &#8220;training&#8221; phenomenon. No major studies. Nothing. Nothing in the fields of sociology or evolutionary psychology. </p>
<p>Even social psychology has ignored it. Social psychology!!! You&rsquo;d think by now that it would be a major branch in their field. </p>

<p><br>
No   &mdash;   the major problem is that the entire exercise is UNNECESSARY. An obnoxious solution to a nonexistent problem. Not to mention an assault on white people&rsquo;s civil rights. </p>
<p>Myself, I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough never to have been subjected to one of these Khmer Rouge re-education camps. So I&rsquo;m curious: are they mandatory? I&rsquo;ve seen references to diversity training in workplaces being voluntary   &mdash;   but the one at UD sounds like it was obligatory. Can anyone tell me what happens to a white person who simply REFUSES to attend? Could your company fire you over it? Can anyone with first-hand experience tell me what&rsquo;s the deal? </p>

			<p>What bothers me about the whole deal is that the diversity course was &#8216;required&rsquo;.  My son will be attending a local college this fall and I guarantee that if they had a &#8216;required&rsquo; diversity training session before he could attend, he would NOT be attending that college.  I will not pay for a college to attempt to reprogram my child&rsquo;s beliefs and upbringing.  College is for learning English, math, science, etc. - or at least it was when I was of college age.  If more students and parents refused to funnel money into colleges with these &#8216;requirements&rsquo; then perhaps they would get the message.</p>

<p>(And btw, what is a &#8220;diversity expert&#8221;?  And while I&rsquo;m at it, what is a &#8220;multicultural affairs coordinator&#8221;?  Whole new professions have been created in this new science of mind manipulation.)</p>

			<p>I heard about this travesty on Hannity&rsquo;s radio show last year and it was also featured on TV on Hannity and Colmes, with Alan  trying to make excuses for thought reform by suggesting 18 year old students should be able to stand up to this kind of intimidation; here&rsquo;s the youtube link: (sorry, I don&rsquo;t know how to make it blue and underlined, - can someone help an old lady with tech stuff?)</p>

<p>Limbaugh also brought it up, together with expose&rsquo; of the University of Wisconsin&rsquo;s &#8216;Think Respect&rsquo; campaign against racism,sexism, homophobia and the rest.</p>

			<p>&#8220;My old man was a former president of the alumni association, as well an attorney who had received his degree from the same institution. I informed him of the libel that was taking place&hellip; and within a 24 hour period, all posters were taken down and a public apology was issued &#8220;<br>
12:10AM</p>
<p>An heartening outcome   &mdash;    for once.   I only regret that they were allowed to slither out of that one so easily, suffering no pentalties or humiliation, and doubtless go on to make yet more mischief tomorrow.  They mustn&rsquo;t be let off the hook so easily.</p>

Rationalism?  I think you meant rationalization.   I have nothing against being rational; I only wish more people would be.  Otherwise, I agree with you completely.  Yes, it is remarkably like Cambodia. I couldn&rsquo;t think of a better analogy.<br>

			<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough never to have been subjected to one of these Khmer Rouge re-education camps. So I&rsquo;m curious: are they mandatory?&hellip; Can anyone tell me what happens to a white person who simply REFUSES to attend? Could your company fire you over it?  Can anyone with first-hand experience tell me what&rsquo;s the deal? &#8220;<br>
*****************<br>
In any company or organization, if you&rsquo;re on THEIR time, you don&rsquo;t have the option of refusing. You go where they send you.  College may be different. Still, every school has required courses.  <br>
I was in the NYPD and we had to attend sessions that were mandatory. No one that I know of challenged it.  You were assigned and had to attend,  period.  It was assumed that if you didn&rsquo;t you would be fired   &mdash;   or at least severely &#8220;disciplined&#8221;, probably leading  up to dismissal.  For anyone who ways &#8220;No&#8221; (to any legal order), suspension is automatic.  I doubt that even the unions would defend you in a matter such as this, as they tend to be on the same side and populated with the same types of people. Race today is a hot potato that no one will touch. So you&rsquo;d probably be abandoned and left on your own.<br>

			<p>Coming soon to the USA.  Multicult propagandais the reason I never let my kids watch Sesame Street. But London children who are in day care because their parents have to work are now subject to racist propaganda.  This is one of old communist now islamofacist Red Ken Livingstone&rsquo;s program for London. </p>
<p>I assume that in a few years London parents who refuse to send their children to one of these brainwashing sessions will be found guilty of neglect and abuse.  Their children will be placed with newly arrived African illegals. </p>

<p>CHILDREN as young as three are being taught anti-racism lessons as part of the first State Government-funded program designed to stamp out bigotry from a young age.</p>
<p>The program will be rolled out at a preschool in western NSW and youngsters will be given regular lessons in tolerance and multiculturalism. </p>
<p>The move comes as NSW councils investigate implementing a similar program across all council-funded daycare centres across the state.</p>
<p>The Menindee Children&rsquo;s Centre, a preschool in far western NSW, has just received a $4000 grant to launch the first State Government-funded program of its kind.</p>
<p>The focus on racism follows the 2005 Cronulla Riots and a recent Australian Government survey which found more than 40 per cent of migrants surveyed had come across &#8220;some&#8221; or &#8220;a lot&#8221; of racism in Australia.</p>
<p>Claims of racism also blew up recently in the Sydney Test between India and Australia. </p>
<p>NSW preschool&rsquo;s director Hayley D&rsquo;Ettorre said the centre would use the funding to launch the program, which was to include guest speakers and lessons on international music as well as foods and books.</p>
<p>But she said the centrepiece of the program would be regular discussions about racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the biggest part of the program, it will be about teaching tolerance and positive diversity every day,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Premier Morris Iemma said it was necessary to teach our youngest about tolerance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important for our children to learn acceptance of different cultures at an early age,&#8221; he told The Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we set our children up with the right messages we will ultimately enjoy a more tolerant, accepting and peaceful society.&#8221; </p>
<p>Local Government Association of NSW president Genia McCaffery said they would study the anti-racism program of one western Sydney daycare centre with a view to rolling out a simular curriculum across the state.</p>
<p>While the Australian national anthem is sung regularly and with gusto at the Auburn Long Day Care Centre - children are also taught how to sing national anthems of Russia, Japan, China and Greece and celebrate Chinese New year as well as Muslim holidays.</p>
<p>Children Services Co-ordinator Gerard Moon said race-fuelled events such as the Cronulla Riots and international incidents were discussed with the children, who range from newborns to school age.</p>
<p>&#8220;Children understand what is going on in the news and they want to talk about it so we will use it and discuss it in a way that is non-threatening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aliya Caraman, mother of three-year-old Aidan who welcomed the move.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like the diversity and for my child to know all sorts of rituals and traditions and celebrations,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Ms McCaffery said the LGSA would investigate launching a similar program in all council run daycare centres but would lobby the State Government for funds to run the program.<br>

			<p>Diversity training has been bloodlessly incorporated into the highest circles of American life   &mdash;   corporations, govenrment, higher education, philanthropy.

			<p>In 1974 I was subjected to one of these brainwashing schools by the US Navy.  About the second day in, I told the moderator that I wasn&rsquo;t buying all the white guilt crap he was putting forth, and that I was going out of the class with the same mindset I came in with.  He was dumbfounded, and couldn&rsquo;t really come up with a good argument to challange me.  Most of the guys in the class agreed with me (they were all white and shipmates of mine).  The odd thing is, that even from the Navy&rsquo;s standpoint, the training was unnecessary, as we were a submarine crew, and in a 140 man complement, less than 10 were black.  With odds like that the blacks behaved themselves and tried to get along with us whites, instead of us having to pander to their feelings.  For our part, we never really gave them an excuse to holler &#8220;racism&#8221;.<br>
Apparently the moderator never ratted me out to my superiors; we finished the class, and never heard anything more about it.<br>
On other ships where black made up a much larger percentage of the crew, trouble was the norm.  During this period a race riot broke out on the aircraft carrier Constellation.  I had a friend that was on board at the time, and he told me that Marine guards were posted at the stern of the ship to make sure no bodies were tossed overboard.  The Navy, of course, tried to hush the whole business up.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I attended Indiana University in the early 1990&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Date Rape&rdquo; was the hot issue back then. The &ldquo;Take Back the Night&rdquo; crowd held vigils on a weekly basis. They put a posters all over campus that read &ldquo;Every Male is a Potential Rapist,&rdquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>12:10 AM, I remember those days! I went to university in the mid/late 1980&rsquo;s.  I too, did not have a sexual history of any kind when I was a freshman. Nor when I was a sophomore, or a junior&hellip;  That is not sad, by the way. It is not anything to be other than proud of. With no small amount of temptation about, I did not abandon my integrity or my respect for myself or for the women around me. </p>
<p>The point is that I was at least a moderately serious student, intending to complicate my life with women only after succeeding in school &amp; becoming able to support myself- and perhaps someone else as well.</p>
<p>The campus sheriff conducted a date-rape program in the dormitories (I always thought it badly termed.).  Attendance was voluntary. Now, I was also active in an all-volunteer anti-street crime group at the time, quite willing to risk my own safety to help fight the predatory violent criminals that are out there. </p>
<p>Every male there was required to line up, told to line up in order of how capable we believed ourselves to be of committing rape. </p>
<p>What a program! There&rsquo;s the sheriff ( a female officer), with her gun &amp; her badge, saying, &#8220;Just get in line!&#8221; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s already 20 years ago.  Now that I&rsquo;m reminded of it, guess what?  Yup- still outraged! </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I will ever forgive that. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try, if I&rsquo;m ever offered an apology. <br>

It appeared to me to be nothing but a Whitey bashing session, with her saying that because we live in a country that is majority white,nothing bad can happen to us, and &#8220;minorities are always victims&#8221;.And some of the wimpy whites were actually shedding tears while she was verbally abusing them.That would not have been my response. </p>

			<p>What they are trying to do is head of basic human nature, I mean at the most basic level. If you take one ethnic group, and give it power over whites, will whites be treated the same by this ethic group? Are you allowed to ask such a hypothetical question? Are they allowed to talk about why dark skin males may make people feel uncomfortable, and maybe that is a NORMAL reaction for saftey sake? Are they telling blond women to watch out for black and latino males? That would be useful diversity training.</p>
<p>No of course not, they start out with an anti-white guilt trip from a LEFTWING position. Now if the left is so up on race, why did this &#8216;training &rsquo; get banned?</p>

<p>That proves how artificial it is.  Diversity is contrary to nature. But there are some people who are determined to force it upon us no matter what. It is their wish, not ours.</p>
<p>As with anything, when you&rsquo;re promoting something unnatural, as soon as you stop the pressure, everything will revert back to normal.   Things will sort themselves out.  And that means Like unto Like, as nature intended.</p>

Let the students who want to listen to this drivel PAY for it themselves.  If the &#8220;diversity trainers&#8221; can&rsquo;t earn an honest livng in the free market, let them get real jobs, like working the night shift in a convenience store in the infamous South Central LA or Trenton, NJ.  </p>

			<p>  White college kids have no pride in their race. They seem ashamed to be white. They are being brainwashed by the liberal commie professors. In every other race the people are proud to be who they are. I contend that the parents must instill in their children pride in who they are, white people. They must tell the kids that white people invented mosst of the important things in the world. That white people are the greatest race ever. They must discard the multicultural nonsense. The future of the white race lies in the parents lap. If all this happens we will be okay.</p>

			<p>Arcadian,</p>
<p>Since there&rsquo;s no &#8220;Code&#8221; section on here as on tech sites (where you can post actual code and it won&rsquo;t translate into results), I&rsquo;m not sure if the below will show up as code or with the results of that code, but I&rsquo;ll give it a crack.</p>
<p><b>Every</b> site is different and supports different formats/codes/etc. (which is too complex and too long to get into here), so I&rsquo;ll just give you the basics:</p>
<p>First of all (to Cliff), AmRen doesn&rsquo;t support the Underline tag. There ARE a set of keystrokes which will inadvertently result in an underline (or a strikethough), but I won&rsquo;t put them here (obviously).</p>
<p>Arc - to show you the code, I&rsquo;m going to type a &#8220;[&#8221; or a &#8220;]&#8221; (without the quotes). For the five examples below, wherever you see a &#8220;[&#8221; (without the quotes), replace it with a &#8220;&#8221; (without the quotes).</p>
<p>1.) To <b>bold</b> something, type [b]bold (or whatever text)[/b] (and replace the brackets as I explained above).</p>
<p>2.) To <i>italicize</i> something, type [i]italicize (or whatever text)[/i] (and replace the brackets as I explained above).</p>
<p>3.) To <b><i>bold and italicize</i></b> something, type [b][i]bold and italicize[/i][/b] (and replace the brackets as I explained above). Also note that whichever tag you use on the outside in the beginning (bold, in this case), <b>has</b> to be the outermost tag in the end (like an algebraic equation).</p>
<p>As I mentioned [u]underline[/u] (using the carats (GE and LE) above in place of the brackets), isn&rsquo;t directly supported on this site.</p>
<p>4.) As far as including a URL link so it&rsquo;ll appear in the format where you can click on it directly, you type:</p>
<p>[A HREF=&#8221;&#8221;]AmRen Home Site[/A]<br>
(Again, don&rsquo;t forget to replace the brackets as I explained above).</p>
<p>5.) And lastly, to include an e-mail link so it&rsquo;ll appear in the format where you can click on it directly, you type:</p>
<p>[A HREF=&#8221;mailto:amren@amren.com&#8221;]Click Here To e-mail Amren[/A]<br>
(Again, don&rsquo;t forget to replace the brackets as I explained above).</p>
<p><b>Please note that this is no longer a working e-mail addr. for AmRen. I&rsquo;m just using it as an example to show you how it&rsquo;s done. For obvious(!) reasons, I&rsquo;m not going to include the valid AmRen e-mail addr.</b></p>
<p>Hope this helps you (and whomever else) out&hellip;</p>

<p>The better idea is to ignore college students, because they don&rsquo;t vote that much anyway.  They&rsquo;ll grow out of their liberalism once they get into the real world.  In college, though, they&rsquo;re easily influenced by the pied pipers with Ph.Ds.</p>

			<p>When I was in the service many years ago, most of the non-southern Whites had little exposure to Blacks, but a few weeks in the training barracks was enough diversity training to last a lifetime.  The pithiest comment I recall is, &#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t racist until I met these n  &mdash;    &mdash;  -s&#8221;.  <br>
     I expect that most of these Whites, even the ones who seem to go along with the diversity routine, are salvageable.  Everyone who can&rsquo;t avoid dealing with Blacks is getting a facefull of Black behavior, just as everyone on the planet sees the sun in the east every morning.  In both cases, the phenomena are undeniable, the dispute is over their respective causes.  Until 500 or so years ago, it was generally accepted by most people on Earth that the Sun went across the sky, and until a better explanation came along that was good enough.  In the case of Black behavior, the world already had a good explanation until about 50 or 60 years ago when an alternative explanation, the theory of White racism, was put forth.  Unlike Galileo&rsquo;s heliocentric idea of the solar system, this theory has not worked out.  It does not explain the phenomenon of Black brutishness well, and it does not allow accurate prediction of future effects.  It simply leaves too many questions unanswered.  The theory of racial difference however, the &#8220;prejudice&#8221; of our grandfathers, is a good, workable  theory and will regain it&rsquo;s place, backed by genetic research.  And those Whites who insist that &#8220;racism&#8221;is the culprit will be consigned to the dark corners of society, along with their flat Earth cousins.  Perhaps the mental health professions, newly purged of fanatics, will add anti-racism to their list of mental disorders requiring confinement in an institution.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Arc - to show you the code, I&rsquo;m going to type a &ldquo;[&rdquo; or a &ldquo;]&rdquo; (without the quotes). For the five examples below, wherever you see a &ldquo;[&rdquo; (without the quotes), replace it with a &ldquo;&rdquo; (without the quotes).&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I see that only partially worked. I guess you can&rsquo;t type in one carat (GE and LE) symbols without the corresponding closing carat.</p>
<p>With that in mind, modify the above sentence to read:</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;So I&rsquo;m curious: are they mandatory&hellip; Can anyone with first-hand experience tell me what&rsquo;s the deal?&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Posted by The Incredible Shrinking White Man at 8:49 AM on January 25 </p>
<p>Unfortunately, in my case, the forced multi-culti indoctrination was mandatory in order to receive my California Teaching License.</p>
<p>AND, worst of all, I had to take and pay for my own debasement as an expensive college class, not a two-weekend &#8216;seminar&rsquo;  &mdash;  I think the correct title of the class was something like Multicultural Education.</p>
<p>Actually, that wretched class and other continuing-ed type classes that I have been forced to attend to keep my credentials have had quite the opposite effect  &mdash;  I learned to resent non-Whites as I had to sit through specious classes explaining how Whites are the scourge of the earth, busing and Head Start are the best gifts the government has ever given to its people, Whites are responsible for the condition of the entire Third World and must pay, blacks and immigrants are noble and to be given special privileges and money, at all times over Whites. And Whites are never to question anything non-Whites say or do against Whites because they (non-Whites) have &#8216;earned&rsquo; the right to abuse Whites after suffering at Whites&rsquo; hands, and so on.</p>
<p>At no time are Whites&rsquo; accomplishments ever ever ever mentioned  &mdash;  including the fact that Whites established the entire educational system &mdash; hell,the entire country.  The Founding Fathers are laughed off as dead White men; they and their ideas to be ignored, if not excoriated.</p>
<p>Can you imagine sitting through this day after day? <br>
Believe me, I hated every minute of it but I needed my license.<br>
 <br>
Many Whites teachers are very angry and resentful and feel the exact same way I do &mdash; but only say so behind off-campus, heavy, closed doors in the company of time-trusted colleagues &mdash; and even then they only speak in whispers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become more outspoken as I&rsquo;ve aged but I still have to measure everything I say  &mdash;  I cannot risk my salary and pension as I work at ground-zero in the PC insane asylum.</p>
<p>I also keep the Pacific Legal Foundation&rsquo;s website bookmarked in my computer just in case.</p>

<p>I WILL GET THIS RIGHT!!</p>
<p>Last time:</p>

<p>NOW I&rsquo;m done   &mdash;   sorry for my typos&hellip;</p>

What a story!  Does this sound like something coming from a free, democratic society   &mdash;    or more like some nightmarish tale from behind the Iron Curtain that we were taught to loathe and fear for so many years?  Thank you, Bon. </p>
<p>Incidentally, you are wise to protect your salary and pension. You never know.  We used to have a frequent poster here, Betty, from whom we don&rsquo;t hear anything anymore.  She too was &#8220;outspoken&#8221;.  Too much so, as it turned out. I recently learned that she was fired, lost her job of 20 years AND her pension, all for making the foolish mistake of accessing this site on her computer at work.  (She admits that it was an indiscrete thing to do.)   Yes, it pays to be careful.  We&rsquo;re not so far-gone as Europe - yet - but we&rsquo;re all moving in that same direction. And no, I won&rsquo;t sign this either.</p>

			<p>I still say&hellip;shove the diversity training where the sun don&rsquo;t shine..it was tried on me ONCE&hellip;I kept on disrupting the class and voicing my own opinions&hellip;I passed the course but I certainly made sure that none of us in the class was brain-washed &hellip;so they passed the whole class (there were 14 of us). They threw up their hands because if a person won&rsquo;t give in &hellip;what can they do to you???? If they would have fired me I would have hired a lawyer..I also made that perfectly clear&hellip;.you fight fire with fire!!</p>

			<p>&#8220;When I was in the service many years ago, most of the non-southern Whites had little exposure to Blacks, but a few weeks in the training barracks was enough diversity training to last a lifetime.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a friend who grew up in a small Northern california town close to the Oregon border. There were no blacks in the town and surrounding area.  The county had probably 1 percent blacks. The draft was still in effect when she graduated from high school.</p>
<p>Some of her class went to college, some went to work and many of the boys went off to the military.  The next summer there were re union parties.  All the military boys came back well aware of how horrible blacks were.  Most were totally shocked at first when they found out that the blacks were not the sainted martyers marching with Michael King that they had been taught about in their high school classes.</p>

			<p>One thing about generation X. With all this immigration, generation X includes hispanics, asians, middle easterners russians and others.</p>
<p>Absolutely none of this group has any sympathy or liking for blacks.  Many were forced to attend school with blacks and learned all they needed to know about blacks&rsquo; rudeness, violence, bullying, loudness and inability to work and function.</p>
<p>Here in California many of the workplaces have maybe 5 White Americans out of one hundred employees.  The rest are various non White and middle eastern immigrants.  The hispanics, asians, Aremians, Philipinos Persians, Lebanese etc etc definitley do not accept the diversity brainwashing. </p>
<p>These ethnic groups also have the old nieghborhood watch system.  Old ladies call 911 the minute they see a black in the neighborhood.  Men congregate at the businesses and around the streets and parking lots.  Part of this is middle eastern culture, the women stay at home at night while the men go visit Rashid at the convenience store, but much of it is driven by the necissity of keeping blacks away from the neighborhood.</p>
<p>To know blacks is to know the truth about them.</p>
