<p>Vietnamese who entered the U.S. illegally after the former foes normalized relations in 1995 could now be forced to return to their birth country, said Julie Myers, director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>About 6,200 Vietnamese were given final deportation orders before the agreement&rsquo;s completion, and 1,500 more are involved in proceedings to eventually be sent home, Myers said during a visit to Vietnam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The repatriation agreement provides steps for the U.S. to deport the Southeast Asian country&rsquo;s citizens who lack required documents, and for Vietnam to receive them.</p>
<p>The deal has been under negotiation for 10 years. Vietnam had previously been reluctant to accept citizens back.</p>

			<p>I used to live in Westminster, Ca.(next to Huntington Beach) where Little Saigon is. That part of Westminster is a Vietnamese stronghold. I don&rsquo;t recall of any violence against Whites, but I doubt any Whites into that area. I do resent the fact that there is a Little Saigon. I say send them all back.</p>

			<p>About time deportations begin!  I hope it is sign of many more millions to come. I am at a loss to understand WHY USA needs permission to return people to country of origin!  This sounds very weak to me.   Here in S CA I see as many people with NO English and no attempt to try here as I see average English users.  This is how I know they are NOT Americans.   I bet most are recently illegally here in CA on Visitor visas with NO intentions of returning home!   V</p>

			<p>Little Saigon is a great place! It&rsquo;s true, you will be the only White guy around, and many Viets will treat you as an alien from outer space, but they are Asians and civility rules all around. I went shopping in a Vietnamese supermarket there 20 years and all these Vietnamese women with strange looks on their faces kept ramming their carts into my cart. No, they were not being hostile. White man is hot commodity there. Interesting place. Vietnamese are in many ways the model minority. I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t send them all back, but these ppl really are good for our country.</p>

			<p>Deported at who&rsquo;s expense? Let me guess, taxpayer&rsquo;s (you - me) expense. Why is it that whenever the government deports invaders<br>
WE, the people who actually own this country and play by the rules, have to pay for it? How does that work? I have a novel idea. Build walled-in work factories and make the invaders work to earn the money to pay for their return trip, and also, any expenses they have caused the American people. Confiscate any wealth and belongings that they have aquired while illegally in our land. No person should benefit whatsoever from breaking into our country. Anything they have gained while here is actually stolen property since they had no right to be here in the first place. I could go on and on but you get the point.</p>

			<p>I disagree with many of the sentiments expressed here. While I <br>
would encourage the expulsion of illegal aliens, why not start <br>
with the Mexicans? When they&rsquo;re all gone, then we can talk about <br>
Asians, if it&rsquo;s necessary. I live amongst a large number of <br>
Vietnamese and Mexicans, and I&rsquo;d much rather have Vietnamese <br>
around. They are, for the most part, law abiding, hard working, <br>
and intelligent. </p>

			<p>I agree with the previous sentiment.  Why pick at a pimple when you have a cancer raging.  Let the asians alone until we can get ALL the illegal mexicans and south americans out of here and keep them out.  Then we can start on the African &#8220;refugees&#8221; we are importing as if we don&rsquo;t have enough blacks of our own.<br>

<p>Law Enforcement around the world would not agree:</p>
<p>There are nearly 500 Asian street gangs in California with the majority of them belonging to Vietnamese, Chinese/Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, and Mien gangs and are commonly referred to by law enforcement authorities as Southeast Asian gangs. The presence of Southeast Asian gangs in California began in the last 30 years after the fall of Saigon in 1975.</p>

 <br>
Vietnamese Organized Crime is a Worldwide phenomenon ranging from the Czech Republic to Oceania.(Google it.)  <br>
 <br>
They have ties to both Chinese organized crime and to violent black street gangs such as the Crips and Bloods.</p>
<p>Along with their many violent criminal activities, they are the main manufacturers and distributors of a new and extremely powerful form Cannabis in the UK.</p>

			<p>Some of these posts are foolish. Let me restate what I have stated many times before:Asians are not interchangeable with Native Born White Americans within the borders of America.</p>
<p>Both Vietnamese and Mexican immigrants can be deported at the same time. </p>
<p>You think Vietnamese aren&rsquo;t a problem? Tell that to the Native Born White Texas  shrimp fisherman who were murdered by the &#8220;nice&#8221; legal immigrant Vietnamese fisherman back in the late 1970&rsquo;s during shrimp wars.</p>
<p>The Legal immigrant Vietnamese and their &#8220;American&#8221; born offspring already a potent pro-immigration political force, part of the larger Asian racialist political movement growing in strength with each passing year-within the borders of OUR America. And as consequence, the California State University system is now 40 percent Asian and is now being refered to in major newspaers-NYT-as the Asian University. If you have no problem with this state of affairs, you are not a White Nationalist and you are the enemy of Native Born White America.</p>
<p>Let me state something manifestly obvious and true:Legal immigrant Asians and their &#8220;American&#8221; born offspring do not harbor benign intentions towards Native Born White Americans.There are no racial/demographic,economic and environmental reasons to import Vietnamese immigrants into America.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans are not required to be even-handed in their attitude towards immigration policy. Do you think the Legal immigrant Asians-Vietnamese variety- and their offspring are?</p>

<p>Exactly right. That&rsquo;s why Garmin, started by Dr. Min Kao, employs 3,000 Americans (Mostly White) near where his White Buddy co-founder Gary Burrell is located. And why SureFire owner Paul Kim employs lots of Whites in his factories making the products his White citizens need in Iraq and Afghanistan. Damn racist Asians!</p>

			<p>Yes, send them packing, but I have a soft spot for the Viets because of their demonstrations in support of Vietnam vets. &#8220;Vietnam vets are our heroes&#8221; the placards read when the Vietnamese President came by for a visit.</p>

			<p>This is a tragedy: The Vietnamese have been model citizens. Lower crime rate that whites. They have EXCELLED in business and technology. A great asset to this country. They are patriotic, self-sufficient, love this country, and are rabidly anti-communist. Quite unlike our RAPIDLY INCREASING black imports: In case you have not been paying attention, our government has been importing millions of LEGAL black Africans and Carribeans in the last decade. Some posters on this site are truly CLUELESS as to where the REAL threat is! (Clue: It&rsquo;s not Vietnamese immigrants.)</p>

			<p>SE Asian gangs are not that big of a deal, but I guess you don&rsquo;t want to be a White boy in their neighborhoods. I have been living around these Hmong, Lao, Vietnamese and Khmers for a long time now, and I would take them over Hispanics and Blacks any day of the week. Even though Fresno is swarming with SE Asians and it is true there are many gangs, the Asians (almost all SE Asians) still have a much lower crime rate than even Whites in Fresno. I am not sure what is going on. Maybe the Asian gang crime is balanced out by almost zero crime by the older SE Asians. Or maybe the gangs themselves don&rsquo;t even do much. I think maybe they just fight amongst themselves and sell drugs, probably mostly weed. They do commit violent crimes, but that&rsquo;s mostly home invasion stuff and they only target their own kind. It&rsquo;s pretty rare they would target a non-Asian.</p>
<p>Chinese gangs are really nothing. They are important to LE but not to you or me. They are like the Italian Mafia. They run protection rackets, gambling dens, maybe smuggling, but they don&rsquo;t do street crime and the protection rackets are all on Chinese businesses. There&rsquo;s almost no risk of them targeting a non-Chinese. </p>

<p>It is really disgusting to see some &#8220;White Nationailist&#8221; in this thread making the case for Asian Legal immigration because they excell academically. If you are a real White Nationalist you will advocate the develpment of home-grown Native Born White engineering and scientific talent. &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; who justify both LEGAL and illegal Asian immigration are arguing the following:without LEGAL immigrant Asians-including the Vietnamese variety-America would never be able to fill its engineering and scientific needs if America had to rely upon the Native Born White population.This is obviously false and reeks of contempt for the Native Born White American population. </p>
<p>How did Native Born White America ever manage to survive without all these &#8220;super&#8221; smart Vietnamese and other post-1965 Asians? Quite well thank you. Prior to the passage of the 1965 immigration refrom act, the economic status of Native Born White America was much higher. Forty years after mass post-1965 Asian LEGAL immigration, the economic status of Native Born White Americans is in rapid decline. The pro-Asian &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; who post here would have US believe that without the presence of post-1965 Asian LEGAL immigrants and their &#8220;American&#8221; born gene-line, Native Born White Americans would be worse off economically if the post 1965 LEGAL immigrant Asian immigrants had never been allowed into OUR America. This, Ladies and Gentleman,is a massive lie that WE should never accept.</p>
<p>About the Asian mob. About a decade ago, Peter Brimelow wrote about the Asian mobs in America in the pages of the National Review. He presented data that the Asian mobs are costing OUR America billions of dollars ever year-this in addition to the theft of Native Born Whie American jobs by the &#8220;nice&#8221; legal immigrant Asians. To paraphrase Peter Brimelow:We have a choice between choice between Canonese variety of organized asian crime syndicates or Mandarin varety of organized crime syndicates. </p>
<p>WE are truely being blessed by diversity-Asian variety aren&rsquo;t we foks.</p>
<p>The economic case for post-1965 Asian LEGAL immigrant is  fundamentally a race replacement argument-street by street,town by town,city by city,county by county, state by state. White Nationalists reject the economic case for post-1965 Legal Asian immigration.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;m not a &#8220;boy&#8221; regardless of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been living around these Hmong, Lao, Vietnamese and Khmers for a long time now, and I would take them over Hispanics and Blacks any day of the week.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s called &#8220;setting a low bar.&#8221; That these people are preferable to blacks and mestizos is hardly evidence of their desirability.</p>

			<p>I suspect most of you people out there on this board who have no problem with Asians are Asians yourselves.  If there are any White people on here against immigration with the exception of Asians, I suggest you re-evaluate whether your on the wrong side of the debate or not.  </p>

			<p>Cassiodorus: The SE Asians are a problem for young White boys who live in their neighborhoods. One of my White friends grew up in one of their neighborhoods in Fresno and said he had to fight them coming home from school every single day in the 5th grade. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like for a White boy in those neighborhoods. Which is why I referred to White boys. There&rsquo;s not much problem if you are a White adult in these areas.</p>
<p>SE Asians lower the aggregate crime rate. Despite the gangs, they still have a much lower crime rate than the general population. They even have a lower crime rate than Whites. So the more SE Asians, the more the aggregate crime rate goes down.</p>

			<p>I agree with Jupiter, Cassiodorus, and the anonymous poster who posted right after him.  There is a disease on this website.  Sometimes I get the feeling that some people on here love Asians more than fellow whites.  My opinion is that if they are not white, they don&rsquo;t belong here.  And Jupiter is right to point out that we certainly don&rsquo;t need Asians here.  The West did just fine pouring out 90% of the world&rsquo;s science without any help from Asians for centuries.  If you think Asians have a place in our society (in large numbers) then you are a traitor and you aren&rsquo;t part of our cause.  We deserve our societies all to ourselves just as the Chinese and Japanese deserve their societies to themselves.  And as Cassiodorus pointed out, if you think that Asians belong here just because they &#8220;are better than blacks&#8221; then you are bringing forth a sorry, lame argument.  </p>

			<p> &#8220;Maybe the Asian gang crime is balanced out by almost zero crime by the older SE Asians. Or maybe the gangs themselves don&rsquo;t even do much. I think maybe they just fight amongst themselves and sell drugs. They do commit violent crimes, but that&rsquo;s mostly home invasion stuff &hellip;.<br>
Asians (almost all SE Asians) still have a much lower crime rate than even Whites in Fresno. I am not sure what is going on.&#8221;<br>

I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s going on.  They don&rsquo;t report crimes and don&rsquo;t deal with the police, so of course we don&rsquo;t have accurate crime stats.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean the crime isn&rsquo;t occurring.</p>

			<p>Robert Lindsay-even if he will admit to this-is making the case for race replacement. He and other enthusiast for LEGAL Asian immigration would have us believe that If LEGAL immigrant Asians come in and colonize a previously Native Born White AmericanTown  &mdash;  through wage/job theft and the bidding up of the price of scarce resoutces in a town-the town is still an America town. This is a MASSIVE LIE. America is not an idea nation. America like other on nation on the planet-including the Asian ones-is a nation of blood soil and genes. It is completely irrevelant whether Vietnamese are top students and Asians bring down violent street gang violence in the aggregate. I want to live in a WHITE AMERICAN NATION, I do not want to live in a Asian &#8220;American&#8221;  nation. Change the racial composition of America and America will no longe exist. This obvious truth goes to the heart of White Nationialism.</p>
<p>Native Born White Ameicans are fleeing and avoiding Asian infested California. The Asianization of America provides 0 benefit to Native Born White America.</p>
<p>The economic case for LEGAL Asian immigrants is fundamentally a race repacement argument.</p>

			<p>I do not harbor any dislike for Asians. I respect them and get along with them personally. That said, I also do not see them as immigrants. They have their own countries/societies, and we should have ours.  High fences make good neighbors, as the saying goes. We can like each better when not stepping on each other&rsquo;s feet. Students, tourists, and businessmen: fine!  NOT imigrants.</p>
<p>As for the claim that Asians do well academically, or are intelligent, or are law-abiding   &mdash;   those arguments are all irrelevant and specious, whether true or not,  because they avoid the point that we need our OWN space to ourselves.  Just as they have theirs. Actually, I find the current importation of high-tech, educated Asians to be the worst kind of immigration. They snatch up (or are simply given!) the best jobs and positions for themselves - at the expense of our own people, who don&rsquo;t get those jobs.  It&rsquo;s an insult to our people to imply that they can&rsquo;t do these jobs just as well.</p>
<p>Formerly, Asians (and all other immigrants too) came in as lowly laborers and started at the bottom of the ladder, then worked their way up.  Essentially, we were importing a coolie class - what the Mexicans are right now.  At present, however, we are importing a managerial/professional class whose grandchildren will be our new aristocrats and owners, and our grandchildren will be working for them.  Is that what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they spoke of preserving this land for &#8220;our posterity&#8221;?</p>
<p>If I had to make a choice, I would prefer the lowly workers who will at leave me as the owner of &#8220;the farm&#8221;, rather than the slick capitalist/professional who is going to take over the family farm and turn <b><i>me  </i></b>into a lowly worker. </p>
<p>But even better, I say why make a choice? Why choose ANY? Why import either one? We need to have our OWN workers, and our OWN managers.  We&rsquo;ve got to get over this troublesome notion (incessantly peddled by some who have an agenda) of &#8220;a nation of immigrants&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s history. It&rsquo;s past. Let&rsquo;s bury it. We&rsquo;re 300 million now. This is the 21st Century. We don&rsquo;t need imigrants.</p>

<p>This is the position that most of us here on Amren take. I don&rsquo;t know why people are accusing others of preferring Asians. I personally like E. Asians better than many other groups, does that mean I want a huge influx of them? No! I feel that if there is to be deportation, deport the most problematic first, but in the end all illegals must go!! Deport Mexicans and blacks while deporting Asians, not just Asians. </p>
<p>Reality is that we have a very symbiotic relationship with many advanced Asian countries. I don&rsquo;t mind having their students or their high skilled workers, I am not talking about Indian cheap tech workers or uneducated mainland Chinese. </p>

<p>Answer: A good start.</p>
<p>By the same token, this deportation is also a good start. Think of it as a &#8220;dry run&#8221; for the future deportation of the Mexicans, Haitians, Central Americans, etc. The lessons learned from the pimple surgery can be used later in the cancer surgery. Illegals need to leave (voluntarily or otherwise) regardless of their nationality. We no more need a &#8220;Little Saigon&#8221; than we need a Little Havana, Little San Salvador, Little Port-Au-Prince or any other such place. </p>
<p>BTW, I hope these deportees receive a quick homeland geography lesson before they leave. Saigon is now called Ho Chi Minh City, and has been since 1975.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s true I am not a White Nationalist. I am like the anti-White Nationalist.  I come here mostly to see the arguments of the other side. Also I am a subscriber to Amren.</p>
<p>I do support legal Asian immigration and also from other places, but I think we should be very picky about our legal immigrants. Legal Asian immigrants do not take jobs from or bid down the wages of US workers. Mostly, legal immigrants want to work for US wages. It is mostly illegals that are taking jobs and bidding down wages. But importing low skill legals is not good and it may result in a surplus of low skilled labor and therefore bidding down low skill labor by sheer numbers. I want to limit legal immigration to 200,000/yr.</p>
<p>As far as the US being a White country, it is too late for that. The horse is already out of the barn and running down the street. I don&rsquo;t know what to say to you except move to Idaho or Canada or Iceland, or even move to this nice White town in the California Sierra Nevadas where I type this post.</p>
<p>Where I live in the Central Valley, Whites are miscegenating out in huge numbers. Not just White women, but White males too. I don&rsquo;t see what you guys can do about this.</p>

			<p>Realist stated in his post that he doesn&rsquo;t mind if America imports her students or skilled tech workers from Asian. Realist is entitled to his racial preferences. However, White Nationalist must be in favor of 0 Asian Legal immigration-including the skilled Asian legal immigration.</p>
<p>Post-1965 skilled LEGAL Asian immigrants have formed a massively powerfull racialist political movement within the borders of a majority White Nation. The consequences of post-1965 for Native Born White Americans has been devastating. Post-1965 Asian LEGAL immgrants are actively involved in the deskilling and destruction of thousands of years of collective engineering and technological expereince that resides in the brains of Native Born White America. This is in the realm of incipient genocide against the the majority Native Born Whie population. And when ever Native Born White Americans organize and revolt against there dispossession at the hands of LEGAL immigrant Asians and their &#8220;American&#8221; born gene-line. Asian &#8220;Americans&rsquo; issue public threats to Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Here are three examples of public threats made by Asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; to Native Born White Amerians:</p>
<p>Threat numeber1)A few months after 9/11, representatives from the Pakistatni &#8220;American&#8221; community worried that Native Born Whie Americans might shut all immgration down completely issued a public threat that stated1)Ameria can&rsquo;t survive without skilled Pakistani LEGAL immigants and that if 2)Pakistani LEGAL immigration were to be shut down, Pakistani &#8220;Americans would use their wealth and political clout to retaliate&#8221;there will be serious consequences&#8221;. This was a front page story in the NYT.</p>
<p>Threat number 2) Four years ago, Lou Dobbbs had a representative-a multimillioniare-from the Indian &#8220;American&#8221; community to discuss the H-1 B  and L-1 visa visa programs. This Indian &#8220;American&#8221; issued a stark threat during the interview with Lou Dobbs. In no uncertain terms on national TV, this Indian &#8220;American&#8221; said that if Americans-White Variety of course-shut down the H-1 B and L-1 B visa programs,  Indian &#8220;Americans&#8221; would retaliate. Lou Dobbs ask this Indian &#8220;American&#8221; to clarify what he meant by retaliation. No answer was forthcomming.</p>
<p>Threat number 3) A few months after threat number two was made on the Lou Dobbs show, another Indian &#8220;American&#8221; came on to defend the outsourcing of American tech jobs-high paying jobs for White Americans. This very wealthy young Indian &#8220;American&#8221; stateded unequivocably-in his heavy hindi accent- that if Americans-White variety obvioulsy-shut down outsourcing, the Indian &#8220;American &#8221; commuity would retailiate.</p>
<p>Realist, if you like Asian students and Asian skilled workers, you are free to move to India,China or Pakistan. WE don&rsquo;t want asian students and asian skilled workers imposed upon US.</p>

			<p>It amazes me how you &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; contemplate the suicide of this country so casually.  Whites are gradually losing political, cultural and economic control of America.  If we stay on this course, in a 100 years when Japan is still Japan and China is still China and every nonwhite nation in the world retains it ethnic homogenity, America (and probably the rest of the West) will be buried in nonwhite populations. Unlike the rest of the world, we will be marginalized and unable to pursue our own destiny.  Make no mistake, pnce the majority nonwhite population comes to power they will discriminate against us with laws, taxation and their own immigration quotas.  I could say think about your grandchildren, but I think the biggest chunk of you people are either gay or unable to attract a White spouse because of certain shortcomings.    </p>

<p>Just for the record, I am quite pro-Asian and pro-Hispanic, and have often posted in defense of these two groups on this site. However, when it comes to blacks, there is more truth on this site than you will find anywhere. (You won&rsquo;t admit it, but to survive you act in accordance with this truth. You know what neighborhoods not to venture into at night. And most certainly not to live in.) If you are on a crusade to fight &#8220;racism&#8221;, may I suggest you get your &#8220;racism meter&#8221; properly &#8220;calibrated&#8221; first:<br>
