						<p>With suicide bombers in the capital, spiralling opium production and half the country prey to Taleban guerrillas, Afghanistan&rsquo;s spiritual guardians have discovered a dangerous new peril: Indian soap operas.</p>
<p>In an echo of the strict religious laws of the Taleban era, the Islamic Council of Scholars won the backing this week of a powerful government minister in its campaign to get dozens of wildly popular Bombay dramas off Afghanistan&rsquo;s television screens.</p>
<p>The Minister of Information and Culture has written to television executives to threaten prosecution if they show footage that offends morality. He is particularly concerned about Indian soaps.</p>
<p>His announcement came after dozens of clerics met President Karzai a week ago to demand a ban on shows that they claim are &#8220;spreading immorality and un-Islamic culture&#8221;. The dramas have won thousands of devotees in Afghanistan who enjoy the escapist world of the fictional Bombay rich. Anywhere else, the family dramas with wooden acting and creaking sets would be thought tame. They have, however, offended the country&rsquo;s new moral enforcers, who fear that the soaps will fuel a craze of &#8220;stone worship&#8221;, or veneration of Hindu idols.</p>
<p>The enforcers are also urging the Government to take action to get a young generation of rappers and pop stars off air. The old men accuse the musicians of polluting the nation&rsquo;s moral standards and they have chastised Afghans who watch television when they could go to the mosque.</p>
<p>Before turning their sights on Kabul&rsquo;s buoyant new media world the scholars&rsquo; main campaign was to bring back public executions, last seen in the capital when the Taleban were in control. The battle to censor television is also a throwback to the days of Taleban rule when entertainment was banned and Kabulis had to watch smuggled videos in the secrecy of their own homes at the risk of jail.</p>
<p>The campaign is also an illustration of the renewed grip Islamic fundamentalists have in Kabul six years after the Taleban&rsquo;s fall from power.</p>
<p>New television stations have proliferated in the past three years, offering a mix of hard-hitting news, which is often critical of the Government, and light entertainment shows, which draw the wrath of religious hardliners.</p>
<p>Tolo TV, Afghanistan&rsquo;s first commercial channel, shows three Indian dramas, The Story of Every House; The Trials of Life; and Because a Mother-in-Law Was Once a Daughter-in-Law Too. Some channels show as many as six daily. Clerics accuse the dramas of encouraging &#8220;stone-worship&#8221; even though Hindu images are pixellated and scenes of Hindu worship are cut.</p>
<p>The hardliners also oppose Tolo TV&rsquo;s pop programmes &mdash; Hop, a local MTV-style show, and Afghan Star, a talent contest.</p>
<p>After meeting the President, an Islamic council spokesman said: &#8220;The unrestrained programmes on TV have angered and prompted the ulemas [scholars] to react. Hop .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is spreading immoralities and hurts the sacred religion of Islam. Afghan Star encourages immorality .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and is against Sharia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saad Mohseni, the director of Tolo TV, said: &#8220;We have so many problems in this country &mdash; kidnapping, terrorism, inflation &mdash; so why is the Government making a big deal about something which is pleasing to the eyes and ears of most Afghans?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Oh dear - it seems that even our &#8220;friends&#8221; the &#8220;Islamic fundamentalists&#8221; are grappling with the loathesome creature known as &#8220;the Western lifestyle&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Perhaps, the ulemas will broadcast their own soaps and sitcoms.  &#8220;As the Worm Turns&#8221;?  &#8220;No Sex in the City&#8221;?</p>

			<p>A much more effective tactic would be using footage from these soap operas themselves while ridiculing the content.  Nothing is preventing conservative Afghanis from operating their own TV station.  If foreign programming appeals to their fellow Afghanis, they could attract viewers by offering carefully chosen &#8220;clean&#8221; foreign programming, interspersed with their own messages.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll never do this, though.  A clergy that is accustomed to giving orders and murdering people who won&rsquo;t obey is not savvy enough to conduct a slick propaganda campaign that will convince people en-masse.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably also worried about nothing, except the rap music.  I find the notion of a Pathan rapper-wannabe with his pants sagging, a hat on backwards and a medallion the size of an alarm clock, chanting moronic &#8220;lyrics&#8221; while flashing gang signs, every bit as revolting as any Taliban Imam would.  Perhaps an exception to the ban on public executions could be made in these cases.  An Pathan rapper would probably be good at it, though; they already have the misogeny bit down pat.</p>
