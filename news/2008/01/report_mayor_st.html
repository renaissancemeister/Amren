						<p>Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick exchanged romantic text messages with a top aide, contradicting their denials in court that they had romantic ties, a newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The county prosecutor&rsquo;s office declined to comment on the legal implications of the report, posted Wednesday on the Detroit Free Press&rsquo; Web site. A conviction of lying under oath can bring up to 15 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick and Christine Beatty testified last summer in a police whistle-blower lawsuit and denied any sexual or romantic ties in 2002 and 2003. But the Free Press said it examined about 14,000 text messages on Beatty&rsquo;s city-issued pager from those years and found many examples of such ties.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick is married, and Beatty was married at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m madly in love with you,&#8221; Kilpatrick wrote on Oct. 3, 2002.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you feel that way for a long time,&#8221; Beatty replied. &#8220;In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, I am madly in love with you, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>On Oct. 16, 2002, Kilpatrick wrote Beatty: &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been dreaming all day about having you all to myself for 3 days. Relaxing, laughing, talking, sleeping and making love.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his testimony last summer, at one point Kilpatrick expressed anger about claims of an affair between him and Beatty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it was pretty demoralizing to her &mdash; you have to know her &mdash; but it&rsquo;s demoralizing to me as well,&#8221; the mayor said. &#8220;My mother is a congresswoman. There have always been strong women around me. My aunt is a state legislator. I think it&rsquo;s absurd to assert that every woman that works with a man is a whore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s disrespectful not just to Christine Beatty but to women who do a professional job that they do every single day. And it&rsquo;s also disrespectful to their families as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whats we all gots here, is a perpetrated mix up of Ebonic Detroitoid vernacular and the &ldquo;wicked white&rdquo; Suburban equivalents of such. Let me please exemplify right here, without objectifications or qualifications in my translations:</p>
<p>Relaxing, is meant to indicate banter over wine prior to Crack or <span class="caps">PCP </span>consumption;</p>
<p>Laughing, would indicate the euphoric state of obtaining the Crack or <span class="caps">PCP</span>;</p>
<p>Talking, would indicate the intensely agitated and sexualized ravings of post Crack or <span class="caps">PCP </span>consumption;<br>
 <br><br>
Making love, would indicate the animalistic unromantic rutting of two such intoxicated individuals or officials;</p>
<p>And sleeping, would be the post intoxicant coma (or &ldquo;crash&rdquo;) of two such individuals or officials.</p>
<p>Thus, we gots the dope on systematic racisms&rsquo; purposeful misinterpretations applied ruthlessly, to bring down a powerful black mayor and his little Crack pipe full of easy-ho and go!</p>
<p>Oh Mother Africa, help us all!!!</p>

I would like to put in a good word for Mayor Kilpatrick. Based on the text messages that I have seen in this article and other articles, he clearly has the ability to write a grammatically correct English sentence. That rare trait should be applauded.<br><br>

					<p>As I suspected, the &#8220;Clinton&#8221; defense is already on the table. One black woman who was interviewed stated &#8220;it&rsquo;s his personal life and that don&rsquo;t mean he can&rsquo;t run the city - besides, President Clinton did the same thing.&#8221; <br>
I thought the Republican zeal during the impeachment was a bit over the top, but we cannot escape the negative impact that his lying under oath has caused. To think otherwise is nothing more than foolishness. Even if you think it was only sex and he was just trying to protect his family, the bottom line is &#8220;if you don&rsquo;t make <span class="caps">TROUBLE </span>there will not be <span class="caps">TROUBLE</span>!&#8221;<br><br>
If you lie about anything the old saying &#8220;fool me once, shame on you - fool me twice shame on me&#8221; should be on the minds of all voters. But, since we are talking about black voters, forget everything after hello!</p>

&#8220;A conviction of lying under oath can bring up to 15 years&rsquo; imprisonment.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
It <span class="caps">CAN </span>  &mdash;   but for a big-city black mayor it almost certainly will not. It takes a lot more than that to bring one of those guys down. Not even video evidence of hookers and crackpipes were enough to kill Marion Barry&rsquo;s career. </p>
<p>But on the bright side, the name &#8220;Kwame Kilpatrick&#8221; always brings a smile to my lips. It sounds like a minor character in some old Hope &amp; Crosby &#8220;Road&#8221; movie. &#8220;The Road to Social Catastrophe&#8221; perhaps, or maybe &#8220;The Road to Irreversible Devolution.&#8221; <br>

					<p>I was criticized long ago for making issue of the many moral shortcomings of particular Blacks in the news. It was pointed out that particular Whites, Asians, and others do the same sort of nonsense. I accept that argument, and Amren might do our cause well to focus only on interracial nonsense, and of course there&rsquo;s no shortage of that bad news. For example, in the situation of a Black boss sexually harassing a White female aide.</p>
<p>One interesting update to this situation was that the mayor&rsquo;s pastor justified Kilpatrick&rsquo;s staying in office because in his words, &#8220;we should all remember that all of us have done some wrong in our past&#8221;. Hmmm&hellip; I guess Nixon should have thought of that one?</p>

					<p>He will not be prosecuted and, if he is, all he has to do is ask for a jury trial.  Detroit, being mostly black, will give him a mostly black jury.  A mostly black jury would never, ever, convict one of their own for something like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember if there was ever a white politician, caught doing something like that, who was given similar moral support by his constituents.  If so, I wonder if the media reported on it the same way.</p>

					<p>As the bruthas&rsquo; say in Detroit in regard to Kwame, &#8220;he a gangsta&#8221;.  Since he&rsquo;s been in office, he&rsquo;s been the ear-ringed playboy &#8220;maya&#8221; who has constantly been caught in various and sundry shennigans and crimes, without accountability.</p>
<p>Some stippers he hired for one of his mayoral mansion parties ended up murdered when &#8220;da maya&rsquo;s&#8221; obedient serfs believed them to be telling the press about all the fun. Shot dead, both.</p>
<p>With city funds, he bought a Cadillac <span class="caps">SUV </span>for a family member, and when caught, he just acted himself - dumb - and said he&rsquo;ll pay for it. No penalty or punishment was forthcoming, and he was re-elected.</p>
<p>And this is the same guy that demands state and federal bailouts on a regular basis. </p>
<p>The city lost a lawsuit (over 8 million bucks) from two black police officers when they blew the whistle on brutha number 1 in regard to his partying, wasting tax money and abusing staff who wouldn&rsquo;t kneel in his presence. </p>
<p>Now he is getting a federal charge for lying during the above mentioned circus. Note:  when first accused of playing with that &#8220;gurl&#8221;, he wailed loud, indignant &#8220;victim&#8221; rants to the press, like a common hoodlum.  The fool doesn&rsquo;t know when to stop digging, but then again, why should he?  He&rsquo;ll cash in on his adolescent acting out. He&rsquo;ll now be raised in status among blacks.  </p>
<p>Blacks have a reverse value system where failure and crime is admired and rewarded, and that, commonly, with more votes along with federal and state help in the form of continued grants.  When black communities can&rsquo;t account for the money given them, they ignore the complaints, demand more cash and they get it. Their pimps, the black congressional caucus, sees to it.</p>
<p>Kwame will be goin&rsquo; places because lying and other adolescent, aberrant behaviors (that hurt them) is considered legitimate behavior in the ghetto. Can anyone say, &#8220;Bell Curve&#8221;? </p>
<p>When re-election comes around, he&rsquo;ll be a shoo-in by a huge majority. If he wants a congressional seat, it&rsquo;s his.  It&rsquo;s the black way.  Where most whites punish, blacks empower.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s black politics, folks.  Third world and they are lovin&rsquo; it.    </p>

					<p>Hey, guys, stop. Here are my words in defense of this Romeo. I&rsquo;m not trying to be another Shakespeare, yet we need one to sing such love. Love, the all-beautifying love was his impulse and goal. </p>
<p>Here is my appeal to American women. Please, don&rsquo;t kill Patrick, vote for Kilpatrick. Make him a senator. And after he becomes a president, he will share his love with all American people, especially women, especially nice looking. Women, vote for Kilpatrick. He is able to make you happy. <br>
As Shakespeare would say:</p>
<p>The size of his love,<br>
Is good for every lady enough.<br><br>

					<p>It is nearly unbeleivable that a major city in America, with such a huge budget, large population,etc. etc. is being ran by such a group of totally inept and corrupt fools, but the sad truth is that there are several major cities in America, that are suffering thru similar problems, the one thing they all have in common is black leadership. God help us.</p>

<p>Good Point!  Maybe he took lessons from Bill Clinton who set the standard for thinking below the waist.  The liberal philosophy ignores social values, folkways and mores. Look how many people still fawn over that sexual predator today.</p>
<p>But black politicians are still elevated in status when caught exploiting and then using and abusing others, particularly their constituents.  Blacks are politically into pain, very much so, especially if a government check arrives every month.  </p>
<p>If Detroit&rsquo;s &#8220;gangsta maya&#8221; read your post, he&rsquo;s probably planning for that higher office right now.</p>
<p>To the male Democrat, fidelity in marriage and faithfullness is so&hellip;..pre-sixties.  How quaint, they believe. And those gals that &#8220;talk&#8221; can be &#8220;taken care of&#8221; in order to silence them.  Look at Juanita Broderick and that poor young woman who hooked up with the former Senator Gary Condit. </p>
<p>btw:  Sharon McPhail, the seemingly white woman in Kwamee&rsquo;s cabinet, is black.  He does not have any whites in his inner circle.     </p>

					<p>Honestly who really cares? Obviously you have to lie about having romantic relations with a woman if she has a husband.  Judging a leader�s worth based on his sexual discretions is inane and childish. </p>
<p>As alluded to above with the Marion Barry, blacks certainly aren&rsquo;t going to turn their backs on one of their own just because of a few indiscretions.  Quite the contrary this will certainly only bolster his image as a playa&rsquo; who lives large and does little productive work while showering his peeps with lavish gifts from the pocketbooks of the taxpayers. </p>
<p>While the corruption of his regime is beyond comprehension, including the proposed selling off of Detroit&rsquo;s public parks to satisfy a libel judgment against himself (!) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Kilpatrick#Sale_of_City_Parks," rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Kilpatrick#Sale_of_City_Parks,</a><br>
as long as he remembers Mayor Nagin&rsquo;s first rule of politics and remembers to ratchet up the anti white hatred, when your incompetence is exposed, he will remain in power for as long as he likes.</p>

<p>It all has to do with standards and respect for the traditions of the country.  Fidelity in marriage demonstrates how much a candidate honors his or her commitments.  If they can&rsquo;t commit to being faithful to a spouse, how can they be trusted by those he or she was elected to serve. </p>
<p>In my work, I found it to be common for a highly paid executive to have a &#8220;kept woman&#8221; while the trophy wife was at home keeping busy raising the children and volunteering at a local charity.  Both adults sort of accept the arrangement as long as the money is flowing.  Of course, both parties end up completely miserable and usually dependent to alcohol or drugs to keep the dishonesty going.  Moral codes serve a multitude of functions.  </p>
<p>Black communities have lower standards all around and the citizens therein have contempt for blacks in their midst who have high standards. Look to see what their neighborhoods have become.  </p>
<p>It does matter   &mdash;   very much   &mdash;   if a person in office honors their commitments.  </p>
<p>The problem with Detroit&rsquo;s brutha number 1 is that he lied about it to a federal investigator. His infidelity is but a by-product.        </p>

					<p>Poster &#8220;10:17&#8221; above has provided us all with a &#8220;teaching moment&#8221;, as he says :</p>
<p>&#8220;Would anyone of us be surprised if a high elected politician in this country didn&rsquo;t have a mistress? This is such an ordinary transgression that I can&rsquo;t understand why it was posted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks, 10:17, for showing us all the meaning of completely missing the point. Here&rsquo;s the <strong>first sentence</strong> of the article that you&rsquo;re commenting on:</p>
<p>&#8220;Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick exchanged romantic text messages with a top aide, <strong>contradicting their denials in court</strong> that they had romantic ties, a newspaper reported&#8221; [emphasis added].</p>
<p>10:17, do you know the word &#8220;perjury&#8221;? What&rsquo;s important here is that if you (probably) or I (certainly) did this same thing, we&rsquo;d be in <strong>jail</strong>, because it&rsquo;s a <strong>crime</strong>.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  but apparently not our esteemed Hip-Hop Mayor, just like our first &#8220;black President&#8221;, the Man from Hope. </p>
<p>In other words, we&rsquo;re not talking about an &#8220;ordinary transgression&#8221;, to use your words. Common, maybe, but not ordinary.  Now are you beginning to understand why this was posted?</p>
