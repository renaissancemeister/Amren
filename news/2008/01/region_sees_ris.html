						<p>While homicides fell significantly, serious crime in the dozens of communities patrolled by the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department rose 4% overall in 2007 &mdash; prompting Sheriff Lee Baca to warn that a worsening economy could present a tough crime picture for 2008.</p>
<p>An increase in robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries and other property crimes drove the crime uptick, according to statistics compiled by the department, which protects about 3 million people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Baca&rsquo;s concerns are borne out by Los Angeles County&rsquo;s unemployment rate, which stood at 5.3% in November, nearly 1% higher than the same month a year before. It was the largest year-to-year increase since 2002.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, serious crime dropped 4.9% on neighboring turf patrolled by the Los Angeles Police Department, which also recorded its fewest homicides &mdash; 392 &mdash; in 37 years. LAPD Chief William J. Bratton, in comments Wednesday, differed sharply with Baca in his analysis of crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Malcolm Klein, professor emeritus of sociology at USC and a gang expert, said Bratton is mistaken in deriding socioeconomic factors but said it&rsquo;s overly simplistic to draw a direct connection between unemployment and the crime rate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Baca said that his 17% reduction in homicides, coming on top of a 13% plunge in 2006, is a success story. Deputies investigated 273 slayings, down from 328 the previous year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Baca credited aggressive gang enforcement and a close partnership with communities such as Compton for the turnaround in homicides.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anti-gang deputies have concentrated on getting guns out of the hands of gang members. Last year, sheriff&rsquo;s officials and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shut down a Compton gun store that had sold nearly 900 weapons that ended up being confiscated during criminal investigations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rapes declined 7%, but robberies rose 3% and aggravated assaults jumped 6%.</p>
<p>Burglaries climbed by 6% and larceny/thefts went up by 7%, while vehicle thefts declined by 5%.</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s officials said there was also a 12% jump in arson &mdash; from 904 in 2006 to 1,015 last year.</p>

<p>Does this mean that the gun shop sold weapons to those who are not legally permitted to have them?  Or did it just happen to sell legit guns to legit people who had them stolen from their premises?</p>

			<p>Hey, I live close to L.A. Bratton the police chief, and Villaragossa the Mayor have made several appearon local television, mouthing off on how crime is way down. Of course, no one who has lived in the area for the last twenty years believes a word of what they say  &mdash;   because they&rsquo;re flat out lying.</p>

<p>Translation??: A huge donkey-load of taxpayer cash was spent on heroic law enforcement &#8220;programs&#8221; in Los Angeles County that have temporarily saved the lives of 50 to 75 people (of which 90% could never qualify for &#8220;innocent victim&#8221; status) from gangland slayings while the other critical indices of felony crimes against people and property have ascended at a rate that comports with the general level of collapse of civilization in the region.</p>

			<p>This crime is designed to force whites to move out of California.  The US Congress has decided to return California to Mexico.  The plan is to allow the Mexicans to drive out the Americans so at some future date Mexico can annex California and Congress will allow it citing that few Americans live there anymore.  </p>

<p>Bobby is likely correct. Even if the political-legal complex is able to construe Governmental statistics to indicate &#8220;crime is down&#8221;, (as they usually do unless they want to increase taxes, in which case crime is &#8220;out of control&#8221;), anyone living in the Long Beach - Compton area knows it is only so because people only leave their homes when it is absolutely necessary to do so. </p>
<p>Even those who stand talking with their neighbors  outside their homes in the area are in danger of being shot down in the course  of a random or, more likely, a racially targeted drive-by shooting. </p>
<p>Well, look at the GOOD side! There were &#8220;only&#8221; 392 murders in Los Angeles last year. Now, if we could &#8220;only&#8221; figure out how that figure was arrived at&hellip;</p>

<p>Could this increase possibly have anything to do with the elephant in the room?  GET RID of all the Illegal Aliens and Gang Bangers already!  Then perhaps this increase would decrease&hellip;</p>

<p>How about just getting rid of the gang members?  If they&rsquo;re &#8220;legal&#8221; gang members, throw them in jail; if they&rsquo;re &#8220;illegal&#8221; gang members, deport them!</p>

			<p>California is becoming a carbon-copy of the crowded, crime-ridden slums of Calcutta or Dhaka.  And it&rsquo;s the ruins of places like Compton and South Central LA in general that extend their litter and general societal breakdown to the rest of the region.  Coupled with other factors leading to major declines in standard of living, it&rsquo;s no wonder that hardly any White person with a family wants to live in the not-so-Golden State anymore.</p>
<p>My advice to other Whites moving away from those 3rd world zones aka California, Arizona, New Mexico, Illinois, New York and Michigan, considering I&rsquo;m a refugee from California myself: Get set up in a solid Midwestern or Upper South State, or a Mountain state like Idaho or Montana.  Best states overall?  Not the most glamorous-sounding ones, but solid, with good cost-of-living and most of all, strong Euro-American demographics and values (unless Hillary Clinton were elected, with the Clintons&rsquo; plan to inundate remaining White enclaves in the USA with &#8220;placement schemes&#8221;):  Wisconsin, Idaho, New Hampshire, Iowa, Ohio, Missouri, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Delaware, Wyoming and Montana.  Be active in your communities and politically.</p>
<p>For those Whites who&rsquo;ve been taking off to raise your kids in a European country of your ancestors  &mdash;   whether you&rsquo;re in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Austria or Italy  &mdash;   don&rsquo;t ignore political events in the USA.  Campaign to prevent Turkey from joining the EU, and vote by absentee ballot in the USA.  What happens here in the States, still affects you over there, and the world your children grow up in.</p>

			<p>If homicides are down that much in L.A. County and City, it&rsquo;s only because of advances in trauma care. Can&rsquo;t have a murder if the &#8220;victim&#8221; (read gangsta&rsquo;) lives, you know.</p>

			<p>The only proven deterrment to crime is punishment, our prison systems are more of a vacation for some of the criminals, anyone with half a mind should figure this out by looking at the numbers of returnees. Larger prisons, more harsh sentences, less amenities to prisoners, taxpayers are gonna support these people one way or the other, might as well be locked up rather than running the streets terrorizing honest citizens.</p>

			<p>Does anyone else see the irony in our situation? We are, or were, the greatest superpower in the world. Now, we are a debtor nation whose industries have been shipped overseas, who imports foreign labor and who quakes and jumps when the leaders of that violent and corrupt country to our south demand, threaten and insults us. Our leaders are in the pay of the multinational corporations and have turned their backs on us. We must stand by while a constant stream of impoverished, uneducated people ignore our borders. We are forced to pay for their upkeep while they take jobs away. We must fear the criminal elements because the law is not able to ask their immigration status. We are prisoners in our own land. Our culture, traditions and language have been lost. My new voter&rsquo;s registration came a couple of days ago. It is in Spanish as well as English. I guess to make it a little easier for illegal aliens to vote in their own kind. I have often wished, that if our country has to be taken over, it would have been by a magnificient army of people who were brighter, more industrious and better equipped than the U.S. Instead, these cast off from their own country, who have little education and only want to remain loyal to the country that choses not to care from them continue to come across our borders.<br/>
What a sad ending to a once-proud nation. I had hoped for a brave candidate who would tell the world that the United States will immediately cease being a dumping ground for the world and all who do not belong here will be sent home. But, it doesn&rsquo;t seem we have anyone yet with a backbone. Thanks, Washington. Mr. President, I see where you stated that Iraq will be what you&rsquo;ll concentrate on in the last year of your presidency. Well, it always has been - what&rsquo;s different? You&rsquo;ve shown us, clearly, that you care nothing about us and the wefare of illegal aliens comes first. I wonder what 30 pieces of silver is worth on today&rsquo;s market?</p>

			<p>Funny how crime stats change with the wind. When the LAPD wants a budget increase (read property tax hike) they scream that crime is up.</p>
<p>When they are pandering to the gullible public/liberals/ and illegal groups crime is down. </p>
<p>Rudy did the same thing in NYC. He calls it the &#8220;safest big city in the US&#8221; what incredible nonsense!!! All they do is recategorize different crimes and presto-chango! crime is up or down depending on what you want the public to know.</p>

			<p>If you could make statistics meaningul for LA you must acknowledge most of these crimes are non-citizens attacks on U.S. citizens, but it&rsquo;s only a slow invasion/crime wave.  Hope you can surf. </p>

			<p>Los Angeles is filled with blacks and possesses two of the most blackest areas in america   &mdash;   Compton and south central LA.  Since africans moved there after WW2 those places have become one of the most crime ridden and dangerous parts of the country.  You want to lower the crime rate?  You&rsquo;ve got to get rid of the blacks; it&rsquo;s a universal truth anywhere in the world.</p>

			<p>This crime is designed to force whites to move out of California</p>
<p>I sympathize with the posters view but do not think that this is true.  The crime is simply the result of large scale hispanic illegal immigration.  Crime is what these people do for a living  &mdash;  -whether it be in gangs or otherwise.  If you allow the people in, you allow the crime to flourish.</p>
<p>One other point should be made and that is that the crime statistics are those compiled by the LAPD; they do not include all of the no-go zones in the city where the police are too smart to appear.  When those crimes are counted, the numbers increase dramatically.</p>
<p>LA is the poster child for open borders.  Would anyone in his right mind want to live there?  The obvious answer is &#8220;No&#8221; but our elites are just to sensitive to recognize the truth of their own policies  &mdash;  -there are always other explanations, no matter how far fetched to account for crime  &mdash;  other than the giant elephant looking into your face, i.e. illegal hispanics and open borders.</p>

			<p>The Pacific Northwest is a great place to move to from Kalifornia. Great gun laws; concealed carry, places like Oregon and Idaho are Class 3, where even machine guns are allowed to be owned and manufactured. <br/>
In Spokane, decent houses can be bought for as low as 115,000. Nicer homes are available for well under 200,000. <br/>
Most Northwest communities are clean, safe and have a sense of community. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Bobby&#8221; is correct. There has been no drop in any crime at all, just a steady rise. I live in LA and in fact know several police officers who will tell you off the record that the numbers are cooked. They same crime is worse than ever and the job is worse than ever. They also say the Salvadorans are more violent and impulsive than blacks. </p>
