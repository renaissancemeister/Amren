<h1>Lacrosse Party Dancer Still Claims Assault</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), October 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The escort service dancer who claimed she was raped by members of the Duke University lacrosse team described herself today as wrongly maligned and insisted that she had wanted only justice.</p>
<p>Crystal Gail Mangum appeared at a news conference to promote a book about her life. She continued to say that she was assaulted in March 2006 at a lacrosse team party where she had been hired to dance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am still claiming that a sexual assault happened,&#8221; she said. But she declined to go into detail, and she brushed aside a question about what she would say to the players.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Joe Cheshire, one of the defense lawyers for the players, said this afternoon that Mangun is being used by the people who helped her create the book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her press conference and her continued assertion that an assault happened is really pathetic,&#8221; Cheshire said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She says she&rsquo;s writing this book to help other people, and what she&rsquo;s continuing to do by lying is continuing to hurt people, including women who really are victims of sexual assault. She&rsquo;s clearly doing this to make money. By continuing to lie, she makes everything in the book, everything she says, a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mangum, 30, who graduated from N.C. Central University, said she hopes to get a PhD from the University of Georgia and open a group home for troubled girls. She appeared today in a neat gray suit and stylishly-cut hair, far different from her stumbling image in photos taken at the team party.</p>
<p>Mangum, who has suffered from alcohol abuse and mental problems, said she wrote the book for closure and to help others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t mind, I guess, being sort of a sacrifice to help others as long as I can share my experience in a positive way,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She wiped away tears at times, saying, &#8220;A lot of things went wrong in my case.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The memoir, &#8220;The Last Dance for Grace. The Crystal Mangum Story,&#8221; is being promoted by its co-author, Vincent &#8220;Ed&#8221; Clark, a former columnist for The Chapel Hill News and a self-employed publicist. Clark said the self-published book will be available through his Web site at midnight on a print-by-demand basis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In excerpts released today, Mangum says: &#8220;Even as I try to move on with my life, I still find it necessary to take one more stand and fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to assert, without equivocation, that I was assaulted. Make of that what you will. You will decide what that means to you because the state of North Carolina saw fit not to look at all that happened the night I became infamous.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the book, Mangum also says that her story &#8220;has never changed&#8221; and that some of those who participated in discrediting her were motivated by race.<br>

		<p>That floozie Crystal Gail Mangum belongs in jail with her collaborator Nifong, not writing a book. We all know that her so-called ordeal was a hoax. A big lie just like Obama is a big lie.</p>
<p>Real people would not purchase junk books like the one she is about to write.  It&rsquo;s going to be full of junk and lies about White men of the Duke Lacrosse team &#8220;raping&#8221; her. It&rsquo;s clear that she&rsquo;s not stable and that she&rsquo;s setting a bad example to her kids and to impressionable black girls in general.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that there&rsquo;s only 100 rapes of black women by White men whereas there is over 20,000 rapes of White women by black/mulatto men every year.</p>
<p>The point is:  Don&rsquo;t feed this ingrate.  Don&rsquo;t purchase the book period.</p>
