<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1001/p04s02-woeu.html">&#8216;Xenophobic Climate&rsquo; Fueling Policies, Violence in Italy</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Momigliano, Christian Science Monitor, October 1, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the poisoned fruit of a process that began in the early 1990s, when the first boats of migrants came from Albania,&#8221; says Jean Leonard Touadi, a lawmaker in Parliament and an African-Italian born in Congo. &#8220;Since then, a syndrome of invasion, fueled by extremists, has been spreading in the broader public, even though until recently Italy [had] a lower migration rate than the rest of Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tensions between Italians and immigrants have run high this year. On Aug. 18, the son of an Angolan diplomat was beaten in Rome by a neo-Nazi group. Earlier in the summer, Roma (gypsy) camps were set on fire near Naples. Six African immigrants were killed in September in a small town in central Italy, though some reports say it was a Mafia killing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately the life of someone who is perceived as different is not worth much these days&#8221; says Mr. Touadi, who adds he is deeply troubled by what he calls &#8220;a climate of growing xenophobia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Touadi accuses parts of the right-wing government, which includes the anti-immigration party Northern League, of appealing to Italians&rsquo; economic and social concerns by scapegoating foreigners. Some 12,000 illegal immigrants have been apprehended here in 2008. Recently, the government passed a series of anticrime measures that seem designed to target migrants and minorities.</p>
<p>In July, Italian authorities began a gypsy census, creating files on the Roma living in some 700 camps across the country. The measure was seen as discriminatory by some human rights organizations, as many Roma hold Italian citizenship. But 60 percent of Italians supported the census, according to one poll.</p>
<p>This summer, the military began monitoring Italy&rsquo;s 16 detention centers for migrants waiting either for asylum or expulsion, in response to a declared &#8220;state of emergency&#8221; on immigration. The government also introduced a law allowing illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to be held up to one-third longer than Italians convicted of the same offense.</p>
<p>The shop owners have admitted beat ing Guibre, who was born in Burkina Faso, but deny any racial motivations, saying that they chased him intending only to get their money back. The men were charged with voluntary manslaughter, but were not charged with participating in a racially motivated attack, which would have come with a harsher sentence.</p>
<p>Milan&rsquo;s African community, which includes both immigrants and Italian citizens, met the prosecutor&rsquo;s decision with anger. Some 7,000 attended a protest on Sept. 20 in the city center. While the protest was mostly peaceful, several black youths damaged motorcycles and garbage bins. Riots were reported in Cernusco, a Milan suburb with a significant black population, where Guibre used to live.</p>

			<p>Evidentaly because dark people are incapable of creating sustainable high standards of living in their own enviroments, they penitrate into white societies and into white gene pools, to tap into these more progressive advantages. Unfortunately what is benificial for these dark people is detrimental to the white people and cultures they en-darken.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not sure of most cases referred to in this article, but I do remember reading about the Gypsy case here on AmRen.  This revolt against gypsies was started when an Italian baby was kidnapped by one.  I&rsquo;m sure the other cases referred to in this article had similar beginnings as well.  How telling it is that this author chose not to go into such detail.  Very telling, indeed.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not it at all.  The real issue is the life of those trying to destroy people&rsquo;s country, community, even family, is dangerously close to becoming not worth much.</p>
<p>It was NEVER that the immigrants were welcome or there ever was a time when their presence was either positive or popular.  What&rsquo;s happening is the will of the people who live in Italy has been worked against by people like Touadi&hellip;.to disasterous effect.  This is purposeful and people KNOW it&rsquo;s purposeful.  Where once they tolerated it, that tolerance has run out.  The immigrant will eventually flee or be forced out with military force.</p>
<p>But people like Touadi?  He runs the very real risk of swinging from a gallows.</p>

			<p>Mr. Touadis, I know THE perfect solution. Go and stay in YOUR country with YOUR people. Italy is the home for Italians. They did not build this home for you, TouadiS, they did not invite you, and they DO NOT welcome you, and Italians have a perfect right to know who they want in their house. They dont want you, TouadiS, come to Italy to build Africa. </p>
<p>Arrivederchi, Roma! Welcome, Africa, TouadiS!</p>

			<p>      Hey great subtitle. Indeed Whites must create a chilly<br>
climate for immigrants interspersed with an occasional hot night<br>
in the old town. This will gradually wear them down and they will<br>
evict themselves. Italians are becoming leaders again. I&rsquo;m happy<br>
for them and for the rest of us. Someone had to do it before it<br>
got any later.</p>

<p>Reprisals against criminals and malcontents are regarded as repercussion against those who are &#8220;different.&#8221;  What absolute lies and nonsense, and an obvious attempt by a left wing nut case to spin the issue to make it appear as if these rabid black criminals are innocent bystanders whose only crime is to be &#8220;different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good for the Italians.  They and the Spaniards are the only whites who have enough guts to let them know enough is enough. </p>

			<p>While the government cleans house, the Italian people should be targeting the 40% of their &#8220;fellow citizens&#8221; who disagree with their concerns. Nothing ever changes in a society until average people confront the traitors within; whether family, friend, or acquaintance. </p>

			<p>Good grief, spike lee will be drooling over this and is probably already planning a movie about how the Italians invaded albania, the congo and burkina faso all on the same day. Of course, the invaders were repelled by the well trained organised black resistance armed with nothing more than loud rap and dressed in baggy pants. Heroes every one of them.

			<p>Mass black immigration into Italy is a new story, only really 10 to 20 years old.<br>
Italians had ample time to study the tragedy of the USA and the destruction wrought on France and Britain by mass third world immigration to act and &#8216;nip the problem in the bud&rsquo;.<br>
The mystery is why they did not.</p>

<p>  Alas, the same Neo-Marxist brainwashing by leftish intellectuals was used on the Italian public. The Italian man in the streets was against it, but the greedy privileged elite and leftish intellectuals, and their influenctial friends in America and Great Britain, were all for it.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m proud of the Italians who are rightly demanding their sovereignty.  They are helping to ignite the rest of the first world against the racist attacks by third  world invaders who are not welcomed and who by and large come to first world countries and diss it.  When we yell in unison and demand sovereignty as we are doing more and more, we&rsquo;ll root out the racist third worlders and send them back home!  Power to the people!!!</p>

			<p>The big difference between Italy and English speaking countries is not the racial attitudes of the man on the street, but the willingness of the elites to listen to their own people.  We in the English speaking world have leaders who care less about their own people than in any other white countries.  </p>

<p>Sorry, but that&rsquo;s not true.  A lot of other Whites, it seems, are getting enough of the so-called &#8220;gorgeous mosaic&#8221; being forced down their throats by self-serving bureaucrats.  It&rsquo;s just being downplayed by the internationalist media here.  This must be very disconcerting to all the dopey leftists who buy into this multicultural garbage.</p>

			<p>To 8:11 PM - <br>
Regarding those news links you gave, while I cannot deny that such violent racists and skinhead types must doubtless exist,  somewhere, I can only say that I have never seen anyone such as that.  I suspect that those types get a great deal of attention in the world press because it likes to paint the specter of neo-nazis hiding around every corner and lurking in every shadow.   That&rsquo;s much more exciting (and paper-selling) than stories of peaceful villages.  And of course, it&rsquo;s always open season on Germans.</p>
<p>I can say, however, that I have seen Germans (as in a store)  pandering and fussing slavishly over any black person in sight, in order to show their love and tolerance, while ignoring a line of annoyed white customers standing behind them. This is the far more common example that I have seen.</p>

			<p>In fact, there is a growing tension these days here in Italy. There were some beatings and the homicide in Milan which is reported in the article. What happened near Naples with 6 africans killed, was just a matter between the 2 criminal organizations active in that impoverished area, the local &#8220;camorra&#8221; and the african gangs who control prostitution.<br>
Aniway the other episodes show that we are running out of patience, especially in the big cities, where most crimes are committed by immigrants.We see what happened to France and England after 40 years of 3 world immigration, we don&rsquo;t want to end up like that. The Austrians are waking up too, and they showed it at the elections.</p>

			<p>What is an &#8220;African-Italian&#8221; anyway? Somebody who was born south of the Sahara desert and emigrated to Italy? That makes them Italian, all of a sudden?</p>
<p>Nope. You can take the Bantu out of Africa, put him in a country like Italy, Turkey or Japan, but, they&rsquo;re STILL A BANTU!</p>
