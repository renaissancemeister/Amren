				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carolyn Jones, Matthew B. Stannard, Jill Tucker, Rachel Gordon, San Francisco Chronicle, Oct. 31, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BART closed three East Bay stations for a time this morning, one of them twice, after hundreds of youths jumped fare gates on their way to a protest in San Francisco against federal immigration policies, authorities said.</p>
<p>The Fruitvale and Coliseum stations in Oakland and the Richmond station were all closed starting about 9:15 a.m. as the youths evaded fares. All three reopened by 10:30 a.m., but BART closed the Fruitvale station for a second time from about 11 a.m. to just before noon as more youths jumped the gates.</p>
<p>When the station reopened, security officers with dogs stood watch to make sure everyone paid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The protesters were heading to a rally at Ferry Park on San Francisco&rsquo;s Embarcadero, where they began a noontime march through the Financial District opposing enforcement actions taken by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The protest briefly tied up traffic on several streets but was peaceful.</p>
<p>One of the protest organizers, Sagnicthe Salazar, said she had been told that three students were detained at the Richmond BART station while &ldquo;trying to peacefully get to the action in San Francisco.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Salazar, who is with an East Bay youth organization called Huaxtex, acknowledged that protesters were jumping fare gates. She said the demonstrators were organized independently and had no funding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the rally in Ferry Park, protesters said the BART ride from the East Bay was tense as students delaying trains argued with commuters and other passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a peaceful protest. We were not trying to start anything,&rdquo; said Kenya Ramirez, 17, who traveled from San Diego for the rally. &ldquo;We were just trying to get our message out. Our message is civil disobedience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said the students held train doors open at several stations so fare jumpers could get on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other people were getting upset because they had someplace to go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing it for them. They were being a little selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Students from Oakland&rsquo;s Leadership Charter School, Richmond High School and Contra Costa Community College were among the roughly 400 protesters.</p>

			<p>What right do BART officials have in trying to demand that these Hispanic youths pay to ride on the transit system?  California belongs to Mexico.  These are Mexican children!  The few European-Americans remaining in California have absolutely no right to tell these people what to do in their own country.  Those European-Americans should leave Aztlan immediately and go back to their own countries.  Yankee Go Home!  Si, Se Puede! </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like fare-jumpers to be subjected to lashes with the cane, about ten of them. Believe you me, they wouldn&rsquo;t forget it. For stories of caning inflicted on an eight-year old child for trivial matters, see the book &#8220;Boy&#8221; by Roald Dahl, who is better-known for his children&rsquo;s stories, such as &#8220;James and the Giant Peach.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Notice how the story repeatedly quotes the lawbreakers (excuse me, &#8220;youths&#8221;), but refuses to give voice to those who rightfully thought their actions were outrageous. This is a common trick the MSM uses to inject bias into their stories: talk to only those on the &#8220;politically correct&#8221; (that is, media preferred) side of any story.</p>

<p>No, they were breaking the law but of course why should they be stopped. I mean they obviously support illegal migration, why wouldn&rsquo;t they support other illegal activity.</p>

<p>Plus burglary. In California, if you enter a building with the intent of committing a crime, you have also committed burglary. This would make them ineligible to vote if convicted.</p>
<p>Now wouldn&rsquo;t that be a shame? </p>

			<p>Plan for you&rsquo;re future now. </p>
<p>I recommend concerned whites take a trip to latin america or south africa and start taking notes. You&rsquo;ll have to learn how whites in these societies deal with the crime and poverty as well as devise methods to sustain a living in nations where you&rsquo;ll find employment difficult to obtain. I think we all know the likelihood of being whites hired by the blacks and browns. If in doubt, just review who gets employed by most latino organizations. </p>

			<p>Who&rsquo;d expect that those promoting the &#8220;right&#8221; of persons to enter our country illegally, as well as the &#8220;right&#8221; of these illegal noncitizens to seek any employment, get driver&rsquo;s licenses, obtain city ID cards, to collect welfare, to get free health care and home loans and buy houses, would break the law en masse on a public transit system?</p>

			<p>These sorts of things are just what SHOULD happen.  White Americans have been warned for 200 years to make &amp; keep this country a white nation.  Obviously they have not done this. Therefore, anything that happens to whites is well deserved.  We may fix this in the future but until that is done we are going to receive the natural outcome of our stupidity.  I call this the Neanderthal Option.  </p>

			<p>I lived in SF for 9 years and this is a direct by-product of special rights for minorities.  They live beyond the bounds of a civilized society then whine because they ware treated like they are not civilized.</p>
<p>No one moves out of SF MORE liberal than they were when they arrived.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, all attempts to stop the immigrant invaders have been fanatically crushed by the federal government.  We can&rsquo;t do much at the current time, but when the government finally bites the bullet, we&rsquo;ll be able to redraw the lines and reclaim what&rsquo;s ours.</p>

			<p>When things are going to get interesting is when there&rsquo;s a bunch of incidents like this that occur simultaneously, and local police can&rsquo;t respond and sent men with dogs, etc. to each scene.  Then we&rsquo;ll have another New Orleans, but without all the water. </p>

<p>True enough. But the federal government doesn&rsquo;t run itself. <br>
In this case, then, we have to look at WHO runs and controls the federal government.  Who is behind the curtain?<br>
