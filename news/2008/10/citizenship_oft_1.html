<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-dialysis29-2008oct29,0,2166155.story?track=rss">Citizenship Often Determines Who Gets Medical Care</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Zarembo and Anna Gorman, Los Angeles Times, Oct. 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Roughly 2,000 times over the last 17 years, Marguerita Toribio, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, has climbed into a cushioned recliner for the three-hour dialysis treatment that keeps her alive.</p>
<p>She has never seen a bill.</p>
<p>U.S. taxpayers have covered the entire cost of her treatment in California: more than $500,000 and rising, not including a kidney transplant in 1993.</p>
<p>The kidney failed when Toribio briefly moved to North Carolina, which refused to pay for her anti-rejection drugs. She needed to go back on dialysis three days a week to clear toxins from her blood, but North Carolina didn&rsquo;t cover that either.</p>
<p>The best a social worker could offer was a prepaid plane ticket back to California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Health services and other benefits available to illegal immigrants can vary by the state. Welfare, prenatal care or in-state college tuition might be available in one place and inaccessible across a state line.</p>
<p>The disparities reflect the nation&rsquo;s conflicting attitudes toward its estimated 12 million illegal immigrants. With limited federal guidance, states often are left to make their own decisions, frequently shaped by political winds.</p>
<p>Dialysis offers a striking example of the dilemmas &mdash; and the occasional absurdities &mdash; that result.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many states draw the line at illegal immigrants. But officials in California, New York and a few other states figure that not treating patients whose kidneys are failing costs more.</p>
<p>That is because patients without regular dialysis frequently end up in emergency rooms, on the brink of death. At that point, federal law requires that they receive dialysis until they are stable enough to be released &mdash; usually only to deteriorate again within weeks and return to the ER.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In grappling with what services to provide for illegal immigrants, some states tip toward the need to care for the sick. Others see free healthcare as a de facto endorsement of their presence.</p>
<p>Congress tried to establish a balance. In 1986, it barred illegal immigrants from the federal health benefits generally available to the poor, with one notable exception: emergencies. The federal government agreed to share the cost of caring for poor illegal immigrants through state-run Emergency Medicaid programs.</p>
<p>The problem is that the federal definition of an emergency is open to interpretation: an acute condition that, without immediate care, would seriously jeopardize a patient&rsquo;s health or impair bodily functions, parts or organs.</p>
<p>When does an emergency start? When does it end?</p>
<p>Debates have flared over chemotherapy, life-support and dialysis. In 2002, Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, cosponsored a bill to provide dialysis and other chronic care needed to prevent expensive ER visits.</p>
<p>It failed. What&rsquo;s left is an ambiguous policy that the federal government itself has struggled to clarify.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not pay for chronic care for illegal immigrants,&rdquo; Mary Kahn, a Medicaid spokesperson, said when asked about the issue in early 2007.</p>

			<p>I was turned down because I still have a little unemployment left. 20+ years of paying taxes and the first time I hit hard times they kick me to the curb but the place was full of illegals and their babies right? </p>

			<p>&#8220;When does an emergency start? When does it end?&#8221;</p>
<p>The minute they cross the border and the minute they get deported. </p>
<p>Any &#8216;emergency&rsquo; for illegal aliens, once stabilized, SHOULD result in an &#8216;emergency&rsquo; trip back across the border. Hospitals should comply with the law and report these thieves to ICE, BEFORE they leave the hospital, and before they can steal any more services. I would put chronic abusers of our generosity, and our emergency rooms on the fast track home. First in line.</p>

			<p>Why is it that they don&rsquo;t just TRANSPLANT HER BACK TO MEXICO???? She is illegal&hellip;thus, why is she getting medical aid in a country that is NOT HER&rsquo;S TO BEGIN WITH??? SEND HER BILL TO UNCLE TED KENNEDY OR NANCY POLASI?????? They seem to love these morons and maybe send that bill to Bushwacker who has protected her  for 8 of those 17 years???</p>

			<p>Well what&rsquo;s the answer? Take them out and dump them over the border? Let the patient stay but deport his family? Take them out and shoot them? I don&rsquo;t know the answer either, though I&rsquo;m pretty sure the last option is NOT the viable one! The best idea yet is spread the word that there will be no care for new arrivals, so there is less incentive for them to come here, and build a secure border fence so the physical hardships are further discouraging of attempted illegal border jumping.</p>

			<p>If states start paying for chronic hemodialysis therapy for anyone lucky enough to make it to the US, there will be a world wide recruitment of patients by the Megacorporations that provide dialysis services in the US. You can guarantee that what is estimated to be a 500K dialysis bill today would almost immediately balloon into a 5 billion dollar boondoggle if the states were foolish enough to sanctify the payment for illegal immigrants. There are an estimated 10 million patients around the world who are dying of kidney failure in countries that don&rsquo;t provide for universal dialysis therapy. It would pay the hospitals to recruit these people to come to the US to receive free care.</p>

This is one of the techniques useful for dealing with the illegal alien problem.  Conservative state FORCE their liberal counterparts to absorb the lion&rsquo;s share of the problem they cause.  They are far less likely to be altruistic with their own money.  So they ask the feds for help.  Problem is, handouts to illegal aliens is political poison outside these small liberal controlled areas.  The feds will eventually deal with the problem but by getting rid of these people.  More and more, they are turning to our way of thinking.  The liberals might actually give on this issue too&hellip;seeing as how it is turning the places they live into dangerous ghettos.</p>
<p>A similar process is happening in europe&hellip;.except it&rsquo;s whole countries being forced to shoulder the burden&hellip;.as one country after another comes along to this way of thinking.  The issue is so serious that the EU could fall, if it refuses to cooperate.</p>

			<p>This makes me ill! My husband works hard to pay for insurance, which does not cover everything and they get platinum coverage for free. I need foot surgery in a few years or I may be crippled but insurance only covers 70%. I would be stuck with a bill for about 3000.00 while Jose illegal could get his feet fixed for free. </p>

			<p>&#8220;California using Medicaid to Fund Chronic Care for Illegal Aliens&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely true, even though Medicaid was paid for and supported by the very people who often don&rsquo;t receive it, to wit, the California citizens. Hey, Americans can keep paying medical insurance though,even if it means losing their car, house, and whatever else they possess. WE DESERVE IT.</p>

			<p>The only thing required by federal law for an uninsured person is one free blood transfusion.  Thats it.</p>
<p>When your state says they have to provide all this care to the illegals, they&rsquo;re lying to you.  Again.</p>
<p>You go to Mexico and see how much free medical care you get as a gringo without insurance or money.  Then come back here and see all the goodies the illegals get.  And if you&rsquo;re white without money or insurance in this country, you get zip.</p>

**************<br>
And you will notice she didn&rsquo;t stay in North Carolina! Let that be a lesson. When or IF all states stop providing free care to leelgal aliens, they won&rsquo;t stay in those states, So by extension, they will leave the entire United States. Adios Amigos!</p>

			<p>The answer is delivering the illegals to the nearest Mexican consultate; after all, aren&rsquo;t they there to help the &#8220;Mexicans Without Borders?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;If states start paying for chronic hemodialysis therapy for anyone lucky enough to make it to the US, there will be a world wide recruitment of patients by the Megacorporations that provide dialysis services in the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>That happened in England more than 40 years ago. Indians and Pakistanis swarmed in to take advantage of expensive long term national health services such as dialysis and other life long treatments.</p>
<p>Of course if an American goes to Mexico, he or she has to make the full payment in cash before even seeing a triage nurse.  And there are numerous incidents of families having to pay what amounts to ransom so that an American can leave Mexican hospitals.</p>
