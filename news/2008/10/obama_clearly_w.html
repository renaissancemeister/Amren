<h1>&#8220;Obama Clearly Will Work a Magic in the Islamic World&#8221;</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fareed Zakaria, CNN, October 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ZAKARIA: I&rsquo;m here in Singapore with three very distinguished analysts of international affairs: Kishore Mahbubani, the dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; Simon Tay, the chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>You wrote in Newsweek that, if Obama were elected president, 50 percent of the anti-Americanism in the world would disappear.</p>
<p>Why is it that Singapore is Obama-crazy?</p>
<p>KISHORE MAHBUBANI, DEAN, LEE KUAN YEW SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY, SINGAPORE: Well, let me emphasize, not all of Singapore is Obama- crazy. But there are many in Singapore who are actually troubled by the growing divide between America and the world.</p>
<p>And you must remember that Singapore lives in a region where, indeed, Singapore is surrounded by more Muslims than Israel is. Right?</p>
<p>And so, as a consequence of that, we have to put our finger on the pulse of what&rsquo;s happening in the Islamic world. When it gets angry, it affects us. If it calms down, it&rsquo;s a better environment for us.</p>
<p>And Obama clearly will work a magic in the Islamic world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MAHBUBANI: The president of Indonesia. And he was very clear. And he said, and several other people said that, if Obama &mdash; if the Indonesians could vote, 200 million Indonesians would vote for Obama, partly because he will be the first Bahasa-speaking American president.</p>
<p>And also, at the same time, I think he understands, you know. He can connect with the rest of the world in a way that I think McCain cannot. The psychological universe of McCain is a very confined one. The psychological universe of Obama understands the diversity of the world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So, there is a magical effect that Obama is having on the rest of the world. And that&rsquo;s why, frankly, all the polls show &mdash; most of them, with some exceptions &mdash; the Muslim world for Obama.</p>
<p>ZAKARIA: But the lowest number is in India, Raja.</p>
<p>RAJA MOHAN, COLUMNIST, &#8220;THE INDIAN EXPRESS,&#8221; AND PROFESSOR, RAJARATNAM SCHOOL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, SINGAPORE: I think in India, I think our heart is with Obama, but our head is with McCain. Our heart is with Obama, because I think Obama represents not only, you know, the American system&rsquo;s capacity to change, it&rsquo;s also we&rsquo;re debating in India, about how do we empower our minorities, how to empower our lower castes.</p>
<p>If Obama can become the U.S. president, there&rsquo;s also a debate in India that the Dalit leader, Mayawati, can become the next prime minister.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MOHAN: {snip}</p>
<p>But at the same time, when we look at the issues on trade, I think any day I would take the Republicans. On outsourcing, I would take the Republicans. On immigration, I would take the Republicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ZAKARIA: Because the Republican position, you wouldn&rsquo;t accept it.</p>
<p>MOHAN: And the problem with the Democrats is that they come with their single-issue groups. Somebody does nonproliferation, somebody does human rights, somebody does workers&rsquo; rights. I mean, you have them going around pricking everyone in Asia, without a sense of a coherent vision.</p>

			<p>The foreigners understand race and culture.  BHO is one of them, and they know it.  They also recognize that his election signifies the collapse of the Western world they hate so much.  To the 3rd world, President BHO is blood in the water, the call to all non-Whites to come and feed on the carcass of America.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;CARVILLE: Let me be clear, I said you can call the dogs and light the fire and leave the house. I think it sounds over.</p>
<p>Now let me be clear here, if Obama goes in this race with a 5- point lead and losing this election, the consequences are &mdash; bull, man. I mean I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to happen, but I think David it&rsquo;s a point to bring up.</p>
<p>But you stop and contemplate this country if Obama goes in and he has a consistent five point lead and loses the election, it would be very, very, very dramatic out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the vicious Marxist viper (his own wife&rsquo;s nickname for him in the past was &#8220;serpent head&#8221;) Comrade Carville hisses his insinuated &#8220;premonitions&#8221; of riots and attacks on whites by blacks, should the mulatto &#8220;savior&#8221; not be elected. </p>
<p>Particularly, if he maintains a 5-point lead up to that day of his defeat at the sneaky &#8220;racist&#8221; hands of whitey?</p>
<p>Give me a break!</p>
<p>I once said not too long ago that people like Comrade Serpent Head, are not just predicting such race riots to push Comrade BO into the White House through a campaign of terrorism tolerance, but encouraging it to amuse themselves when they (once again) lose an election because of their Marxism. Here we have a good example of this, from one of their seasoned Clinton politico &#8220;masterminds;&#8221; a call to stick it to whitey, no matter what. <br>
Indeed, a measure of madness, or just plain hopeful abominations and audacious hatreds seen in the light of day?</p>
<p>These people are not normal; they border on being inhumanly warped by the level of their truly evil and depraved passions that pass for thought, in a Marxist abyss of masochistic anti-white racial &#8220;dialectics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did anyone else catch that old queen Chris Matthews&rsquo; near ecstatic and (Harlequin Romance novel) sexualized style of describing of how he &#8220;thought&#8221; the debate should play out, on MSNBC last night in the pre-debate &#8220;discussions&#8221; on Hardball?</p>
<p>He went into a bizarre homoerotic frenzy of predicting that Senator McCain would be the &#8220;charging,&#8221; &#8220;pawing,&#8221; and &#8220;sorting&#8221; old bull, to Comrade BO&rsquo;s &#8220;slim, young matador&#8221; in the debates. With Comrade BO sidestepping him with his flashy Red &#8220;cape,&#8221; at every turn.</p>
<p>Again, give me a break!</p>
<p>Say what you will about the AR crowd here or in the anti-multicultural movement in general, but we do not feel compelled to describe Senator McCain as a man wearing a General Custer uniform and slapping at Comrade BOs flimsily loin-clothed bottom with his own feathered headdress!</p>
<p>These strange and freakish creatures are what they are, but we can Thank God they are more often wrong then right.</p>
<p>Let us hope the same holds true this time, </p>
<p>Because if not, then God truly will have to help us all!</p>

			<p>The ONLY reason people of color like Obama is they think he is going to kill all the whites.  They think greedy whites horde all the world&rsquo;s magic and if we were all gone, than wealth and prosperity would fall out of the sky for them.</p>
<p>The truth is, it&rsquo;s people of color who are greedy.  Greedy and stupid.  And what little wealth they have, is basically given to them by whites in one form or another.  It&rsquo;s basically charity.</p>
<p>But, who can blame them&hellip;.when so many whites hold basically the same view.  No, they don&rsquo;t literally believe in magic (well, for the most part).  But they DO believe, that, somehow, with the evil white man gone, the deserving races of color will be free to create the perfect utopia where everyone is happy, contented and wealthy.  Not only is that delusional in extreme, and VERY far divorced from the reality of what colored peoples of all types actually do, if the opportunity presents itself, but it somehow escapes these people that they ARE the &#8220;white devils&#8221;.  That they basically support their own violent extinction.</p>
<p>Quite literally, a vote for Obama is a vote to kill yourself and your family in the hopes that evil dark skinned folk will prosper of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sick.</p>

<p>Funny, third world hates America, despite the fact that it is American corporations that created wealth and education all over the third world. In Mr Kishore Mahbubani&rsquo;s Singapure even more than anywhere else.Lessons learnt. The venner of civilization exposed. About time to withdraw from the world.Let the divide grow and see how the civilized and enlightened third world manages without the decadent America.</p>

			<p>Obama was born a muslim and carries a muslim name for life therefore he is phony christian and knows if he assume power he can never go to war against his own religion or face death by jihad. <br>
Jihadists will not allow Obama to kill a single muslim and should he attempt to do so will ensure a speedy assasination for him as a traitor. <br>
Muslims will not tolerate a traitor of any form and this is the worse enemy as in any group. Obama is fully aware of his fate. </p>

<p>Oh, great, but just how much of the Americanism in the USA will disappear?</p>
<p>&#8220;And Obama clearly will work a magic in the Islamic world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why not Osama? They would LOVE the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama understands the diversity of the world&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, dumb whitey can never understand diversity. But we&rsquo;re allowed to praise it. And what&rsquo;s more, McCain has never been abroad, right?</p>

<p>Watch these Frenchies pine for Obama:<br>
&#8220;I like the way he speaks.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;he is handsome&#8221;</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same all over the world. The indonesians are obama crazy because he&rsquo;s a minority and because he lived there as a child for 2 years.  Big deal. I was in Indonesia during the world cup and the Indos were cheering for Holland; the colonial power that brutalized them for over 200 years. </p>

			<p>&#8220;According to Statistics Singapore, around 51% of resident Singaporeans (excluding significant numbers of visitors and migrant workers) practice Buddhism and Taoism. About 15%, mostly Chinese, Eurasians, and Indians, practice Christianity&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think that buddhists would know better than to associate with muslims, especially with what&rsquo;s happening in Thailand.  Wherever muslims are, violence will follow.</p>

			<p> Mr. Obama is not a Muslim, but I&rsquo;m afraid a large part of the Islamic world still consider him one. Many believe that he will fundamentally change America&rsquo;s foreign policies. I really can&rsquo;t make any predictions in this area. People change when they become president  &mdash;  look at Bush. </p>

<p>Yes, but this is Singapore  &mdash;  the only place on earth where Islam is actually controlled, rather like an STD in a city&rsquo;s Red-Light District.</p>
<p>In Singapore, all imams have to have their sermons and addresses approved by the Singaporean government  &mdash;  jihadist messages are NOT allowed in this Asian city-state.</p>

<p>Who cares about anti-americanism. We can&rsquo;t elect a leader simply to appease the rest of the world. The truth is America would get a lot more respect if we started acting like the rest of the world and stopped caring whether others like us. Does Russia or Iran go around caring what the world thinks about them or whether the world likes them? What about Mexico? China? The answer is no. It&rsquo;s time we Americans looked out for ourselves for a change. This means no more foreign aid wasted on countries that hate us. Instead this money should be spent on us. It means leaving other countries to their own devices. It&rsquo;s high time we  americans start doing what is best for us.</p>

<p>Notice how bad things are&hellip;it&rsquo;s either Obama, or the Republicans who this Indian knows are for destructive free trade, outsourcing of jobs to India, and massive Indian immigration.</p>
