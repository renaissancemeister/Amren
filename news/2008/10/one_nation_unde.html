<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t see a way to unite a people as divided as Americans are today. We are trying to pretend we&rsquo;re one nation when we are really two.</p>
<p>One of those two nations clings to the promises and covenants of the past, the Bible, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, as the guiding principles. The other believes in and lives with no immutable standards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a Republican vs. Democrat split &mdash; as the current election illustrates. {snip}</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it time for separation? Is the breakup of the union really such a difficult thing to consider? When there are no new lands to discover, what choice do we have?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>America was founded as a sovereign, independent nation. The vandals want to yield sovereignty to global authorities and make America interdependent.</p>
<p>America was founded with a federal government that was to be constitutionally limited in scope. The vandals have already succeeded in obliterating the enumerated powers.</p>
<p>America was founded as a nation of self-governing free people and sovereign states with significant authority reserved to them. The vandals have placed America under the shackles of a central government to which the states and people are subordinate.</p>
<p>America was founded as a nation of people &#8220;endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8221; The vandals deny the Creator, invent man-made rights and deny life and liberty are sacred values.</p>

<p>I listened to several call in talk shows today. Many of them Christian shows. All the shows were taking a lot of black callers. Without exception, they all supported obama. Even Christians black and white can&rsquo;t seem to come together and recognize a militant angry black man. I see no way to come together, nor do I really want to.</p>

			<p>I have thought for some time now that at some point in my lifetime the US will break apart.  One of the reasons that the Soviet Union broke apart were the differences in ethnicity and language.  When people no longer share a common culture the union cannot survive.</p>

			<p>Lincoln intended shipping BLACK SLAVES out of the country at the end of Civil War but was murdered by Democrats.  Its not too late to carry out Lincoln&rsquo;s plan.  Every BLACK family would be given $1M, a ID tatoo, and a one way ticket.  They may never return.  We have the hard working Mexicans to take their place and move into their gutted homes. We cannot afford to keep BLACKS in their free ride anymore.  Leave but leave the lights on.</p>

			<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s keynote speech to the DNC in 2004, that supposedly great oratory which launched him as a national figure, stated that there is no such thing as a black or white America, and no liberal or conservative America, just America.</p>
<p>First off, with ghettos and white flight, you know the first part is true.  But the second part is also becoming more and more true with time.  I received my paper AR in the mail today, the one with Sarah Palin on the cover, but the one before that had a feature article that stated that the percentage of Americans that live in &#8220;landslide counties&#8221; (i.e. counties where one Presidential candidate beats the other by at least 20% margin) has gone up from 35% in 1980 to 48% in 2008.  Meaning that people are moving to areas that are politically more like themselves.  Especially in the internet age, where you really don&rsquo;t need to be anywhere in particular.</p>
<p>Boulder, Colorado has always been left-wing, because of the University.  Once the word got &#8220;out there&#8221; that Boulder was a good place for liberals, more liberals came.  This made Boulder even more liberal, which made it attractive for even crazier liberals, meaning the place became even crazier liberal&hellip;.see the dynamo here?  St. Charles County, Missouri is the conservative/Republican equivalent in the St. Louis metro area, though its conservatism isn&rsquo;t wacky   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s the place to be for St. Louis area conservatives and Republicans.</p>
<p>The point is, with time, every place isn&rsquo;t becoming more like everywhere else, it&rsquo;s becoming more like itself.  I think there is a good opportunity in the Heller SCOTUS decision from earlier this year   &mdash;   cities like Chicagograd and New Yorkscow that don&rsquo;t agree with it should be allowed the option of seceding and becoming an independent city-state.  As long as they have a triple border wall between themselves and the outside world.  That way, Republicans might be able to win NY and IL once again.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s right.  He won&rsquo;t say so aloud, but the third world rabble and blacks are as much a part of the unsavory elements in this country as the radical leftist ideologues, and most of us don&rsquo;t want any of them as part of our country, so the fight with many is not just with non-whites.  It&rsquo;s with their prompters and supporters as well.</p>
<p>So, two America&rsquo;s is something worth fighting for, and I could even agree to having a few non-whites&hellip;.other than blacks&hellip;.as part of the America I&rsquo;d like to see finally emerge in the near future.</p>
<p>Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation, on television a few years ago, called on all social conservatives to work toward a second parallel society in this country, strictly along conservative ideology, rejecting the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Farah is going the necessary step further and calling for secession, which receives quite a response wherever it is seggested.  I wrote him and told him that I agreed whole-heartedly and that goal would be my goal from now on.  He welcomed me aboard.</p>
<p>Farah, as might already be known, advocates voting for neither mainline candidate, because we always get somebody like McCain who has been pre-selected by the party bosses for us, and we&rsquo;re forced to accept the lesser of two evils.  The system is corrupt and ordinary citizens do not have a chance to hold important political offices as should be the case, which was intended by the founders. </p>
<p>So my big mantra from now on will be secession along lines of ideology.  The race issue will take care of itself. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I could stand to live around leftist ideologues even if they were white, because I find them even more dispicable than the Jeremiah Wright racist black types.  They are far more dangerous to all whites in general than the blacks.</p>

			<p>Mr. Farah, surely you jest. What about all of those comfortable (dependent) people that will be cast to the air like chafe? That&rsquo;s right, according to the last article on secession. It seems a lot of folks are scared of freedom and self government. Besides were will the ignorant and lazy folks go? It&rsquo;s true the American experiment has run its course. Separation (secession) is the only remedy left. Vice President Stephens said it best. &#8220;There will come a time when the cause of the South, will be the Cause of All&#8221;. It&rsquo;s too bad that it took millions of American lives and forced coercion, to maintain this wretched &#8220;union&#8221;.DeoVindice</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, this rings rather hollow to me as the same old Movement Conservative complaints about Constitutions, religion and seccesionist fantasy. &#8220;Invent man-made rights&hellip;&#8221; Farah wails. All &#8220;rights&#8221; are man-made - that&rsquo;s what so many today, left or right, refuse to accept! And America has strayed FAR from any ideals this nation was founded upon a looooong time ago - not just in the last few decades. Not everything that afflicts us is leftist/marxist in design.  </p>
<p>What we(White/European peoples) need to do is stop worrying about ceturies old constitutions and declarations and various governmental dogmas of bygone eras and start afresh! The US Constitution is wielded AGAINST our people today, just as often as it may ever protect. Away with it! In one respect, I&rsquo;m totally with Farah, in that we must separate. But he is talking about loosely defined ideologies and cultural philosophies, not even mentioning race or ethnicity. Thus, his plan is hopelessly flawed from the get go. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have all the answers, but what Farah proposes is far too simplistic and ignores the ethno-racial realities we can never forget for a second. AR continues to be too caught-up in this right versus left business, rather than focusing on race and the genetic realities thereof - which is what they do best! </p>

<p>Absolutely.  Let us have the truth and stop living a lie.</p>
<p>&#8220;it&rsquo;s time for an amicable divorce   &mdash;   with each people free to pursue their own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surely liberals would be as happy to be rid of us as we would be to be rid of them.  Imagine having a president, a congress and a Supreme Court that represents our thinking.  Imagine having conservative presidential candidates from which to choose, instead of the choice we currently face of a liberal Republican president or a liberal Democrat president.  Imagine living among people who share our cultural values.  Yes, this seems like a beautiful dream, but American independence was once only a beautiful dream.</p>
<p>The more the subject of separation is discussed, the more possible it will seem.  </p>

			<p>Please, dear Lord God, lead us to secede from this abomination created by America&rsquo;s Elites, an abomination that makes the most crime ridden, incompetent, and politically corrupt races effectively sacred - like rats in an Indian temple.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, this is another reason that the South SHOULD have won. Question Diversity notes above that conservatives gravitate to where conservatives live and rule, while Liberals gravitate to where Liberals live and rule. if the Souht had won its independence, its secession, over time, more and more conservatives from the North would ahve moved to Confederate states, while the Liberals from Confederate states would have fled them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>That is the best hope for us now to save ourselves from the fate of whites in Zimbabwe and South Africa.</p>

			<p>The central issue pointed out by Mr. Farah is this: &#8220;America was founded as a sovereign, independent nation. The vandals want to yield sovereignty to global authorities and make America interdependent.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the second most important issues, being these questions: &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t it time for separation? Is the breakup of the union really such a difficult thing to consider? When there are no new lands to discover, what choice do we have?&#8221;</p>
<p>Most here clearly recognize that what is being done in the name of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;tolerance,&#8221; by the fools who run this country transcends the two political parties. Within that framework, &#8220;globalization&#8221; is the fundamentally critical point of divergence between true Americans and the &#8220;vandals&#8221; as Mr. Farah calls them, or Red traitors as I call them. </p>
<p>Uncontrolled &#8220;immigration&#8221; and forced racial integration are merely symptoms, of the larger sickness; even the official state religion of Multi Cultism, can be classified in the symptom category, when the bigger picture is looked at. </p>
<p>It is the concept of being a citizen of the United States versus a &#8220;citizen of the world,&#8221; that is the crucial intersection that all of these issues bottleneck into and cause our primary source of conflict as a &#8220;country.&#8221; On this point, I am adamant in my assessment of the situation and will boldly state here and now: that baring some wild Sci-Fi scenario or my emigration to another country (even within the geography of a dissolved United States,) I will never consider myself anything but a citizen of the USA and an inhabitant of this planet. Yes, I agree with economic and even (at times) military cooperation with other countries and peoples, but never a merging of them into a border-less and amalgamated hodgepodge of humanity that finds &#8220;equality&#8221; in the impoverishment of the many and the enrichment of the few. </p>
<p>For Westerners in general and Americans in particular, that is madness and any who say differently are deranged idiots or power hungry  plutocrats!</p>
<p>If the only way to avoid the total destruction of our way of life and of the American ideal, is to see the country breakup into several smaller nations, then so be it; it is not what I really want, but it is an acceptable solution to the alternative of a &#8220;global village.&#8221;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>The difficult thing about splitting America up is that people on both sides live in proximity to each other.  Without Los Angeles and San Francisco, California would turn red.  Same thing with New York and New York City.  Dump the twin cities in MN and you have Republican country.  You have counties in states side by side where one is conservative and one is liberal.  These kinds of problems would make for an erratic border. </p>

Amen brother, more and more people are coming to the same conclusion I came to years ago. Separating ourselves from the leftwing loonies and the multicults is the only logical answer I can come up with. Let them have their messiah, their illegal invaders, their Jihadist nutcases, their black criminals, their 60&rsquo;s hippy terrorists, their racist preachers and their paranoid,delusional followers with their lockstep politically correct nonsense. Let the people who are absolutely disgusted and tired of this stuff make their own way. This country was founded on getting out from underneath the British and the British were no where near as bad as the leftwing evilness we are dealing with now in this country. Besides, the leftwingers want the end of American anyway it&rsquo;s the reason they want this country swamped by third worlders.</p>

			<p><i> Is the breakup of the union really such a difficult thing to consider?</i> </p>
<p>Actually, it is. The very roots of this nation lie in the concept of &#8220;manifest destiny&#8221; or &#8220;from sea to shining sea.&#8221; If race realists try to send out the message that in order to solve our racial problems we must break up this country, it will cause even more resistance to our message. If, however, we deliver the message that if we <i>don&rsquo;t</i> start talking honestly about race it could lead to a breakup, that is a different matter. The one message sends out hope and the other one doesn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Remember that when Teddy Kennedy pushed through his immigration reform in the &rsquo;60s, he lied and said it wouldn&rsquo;t substantially change the racial makeup of this country. If he had said &#8220;let&rsquo;s pass immigration reform, so we can eventually break this nation into pieces,&#8221; do you think it would have flown? So why do we think it will fly any better for us? It will just cause whites to push their heads even deeper into the sand.</p>

I am sure they are turning over in their graves at the inheritance we have squandered. Assuredly they would approve.<br>
I am sick of ungratefull non whites, coercive govt. and cultural egalitarianism.<br>
I WANT A DIVORCE.<br>
I have thought about this since I first listened to a New Century Foundation CD on this very subject. The name of the gentleman speaker escapes me at this time. I thought it a novel concept upon first hearing the subject.<br>
This would be a very tricky and complex move.<br>
What to do with all the nukes?<br>
We can&rsquo;t leave them in the hands of simps like obama and other angry libs. We would get nuked in the name of peace and divirsity.<br>
Nonetheless, I heartly approve of trying. We have nothing to loose.<br>
No neoconlibdems though. No central banks. Most of all no mtv.<br>
A worthy goal to work for.</p>

			<p>To those who are interested in what the above article asserts is the authors studied evaluatuion and desire, they might want to consider that the most important thing we can do in order to support the two America theory right now is to make the commitment that we want to branch off from the leftist multicults in academia, the media, Hollywood, and all the rest, and get behind a leader who is hell bent on just that proposition.  Movements are an incremental process, so it&rsquo;s vitally important that those interested must first agree that if it is separation and secession they want, it is necessary to work towards that goal first of all.  </p>
<p>If someone requires an explicit set of tenants lined up and listed that must be followed to the letter, then the separation and secession plan might not be for them.</p>
<p>Mr. Farah will not advocate any proposition that is race based, and that aspect of separation and secession will not be discussed, but use your analytical powers and abilities at deduction and understand that any such movement is going to draw a vast majority of people who think along the same general lines as we do.  Can you imagine our enemies interested in separation and secession?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been looking for a leader with a plan to do something besides talk.  This is a chance to take advantage of an opportunity to take our wishes a step further, and it&rsquo;s an exciting notion that we just might be able to build a very powerful organization with some real clout and still support everything else we believe in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to write Mr. Farah and ask if he can start a forum on his site discussing the prospect of separation and secession.</p>
<p>It would be very helful to us to have Amren on which to discuss and debate racial realism and another board to discuss separation and secession.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s heartening to read the thoughts of so many who think as I do&hellip;who are sick and tired of our tax dollars being used to fund our own destruction.  The idea of a separate country is like a cool clear breeze, the same feeling as when one suddenly admits to oneself that a marriage is over.  That&rsquo;s the thing about hitting your head against a wall   &mdash;   it feels so good when you quit.  Let the liberals have their own country and let them support with their tax dollars all of the Third World trash they insist on letting into the country and do-nothing, violent blacks.  They keep telling us how wonderful these people are, but for us racists.  So let&rsquo;s do them a favor and leave and let them have all these wonderful people all to themselves, without our corrupting and bigoted influence&hellip;as well as our tax dollars.</p>

			<p>It will be either secession or tyranny for the USA in the near future.  </p>
<p>When people ask me if I am a liberal or a conservative or a Democrat or Republican I always answer that I am a Secessionist.  I don&rsquo;t mention that I am for an all White nation until it comes up later in the conversation. Done right, you will find a lot more people will agree with you.</p>
<p>But there are two major problems with secession.  One, I don&rsquo;t see how it can be done peacefully, although that is what we all want - to be left alone, to be alone with our own kind.  No government will give up power without a fight. But, it is hoped, that we will be the exception to this historical rule. </p>
<p>And the government isn&rsquo;t our only source of resistance.  The nitwit elite libs will not tolerate the exposure of their hypocrisy.  This would be no big deal except the libs control all the nation&rsquo;s propaganda machines like the media, schools, colleges, newspapers, movies, theaters, etc.  (Which of course is why the country is in such a mess.)  </p>
<p>And we all know the blacks and browns will never agree to peaceful  separation.  They know they cannot survive let alone thrive without the White man.  Perhaps reparations can be used as a quick bribe to get them to agree.  We would have to act quickly though after they are paid so that by the time they get done blowing the money and stealing it from each other they won&rsquo;t know what happened.  </p>
<p>The second major issue facing secession is economics.  What kind of currency would we use?  The dollar is useless and it would keep us tied to whatever the rest of the former USA remained.  Gold backed money is the answer but where will we get the gold?  How will we structure the society monetarily, etc?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have all the answers but I know which direction we must work to get to an all White republic.    </p>

<p>Sorry, friend. Your &#8220;hardworking Mexicans&#8221; are just as big a problem (bigger really, since they outnumber Blacks more than two to one). We need to evict BOTH groups from our country&hellip; that is if we want a clean, decent America to raise our families. Probably over 90% of domestic crime can be fairly attributed to these two racial minorities. Showing that Blacks work twice as hard at crime as Mexicans, being outnumbered as they are.</p>
<p>Mexicans might &#8220;work hard.&#8221; But drink hard, too. Per the horrendous number of DWI accidents they cause. Add that $90 billion it costs taxpayers to provide supplemental welfare checks, food stamps, free healthcare and free educational benefits to illegals and their families&hellip; so you just might want to rethink YOUR position, friend. (P.S. Having visited NJ a few months ago&hellip; I do agree with your general thinking, however.)</p>

			<p>Another secession article and more flights of fancy. It is politically and logistically impossible to create two separate countries based on left/right or ethnic grounds, at least in a peaceful, orderly manner. We are heading towards a left/non-white soft totalitarian government as anyone can plainly see. Do you think they will entertain any kind of separation talk? Nonsense. They will see whites as the cow to be milked and therefore not be allowed to stray off the farm. If however we allow for the possibility of events causing the conditions for a separation I can easily foresee a number of scenarios that might lead to such a result. </p>
<p>There would have to be massive wide-spread social upheaval, economic collapse and near anarchy for a separation scenario to be plausible. In this scenario, whites are forced by circumstances to come together and organize in self-defense. I think such a possibility could happen very quickly under the right set of circumstances. Under thsese conditions, as at many other times and in many other places, a large scale migration would start with whites moving to safer places and non-whites moving to be with their ethnic and racial cohorts. Such a migration-driven scenario could create at least three separate proto-nations within six months to a year. This is the only plausible way I can see to effect a very desirable separation.</p>

			<p>All these suggestions sound great, but there is one key ingredient missing. We need real Statesmen to make it work. The founding fathers were a unique blend of people who shared the same hunger for freedom and were prepared to die for the Constitution they penned. Where are these Statesmen today? They are just too busy getting fat at the trough of special interest and besides they don&rsquo;t see any of problems that we have. Everything is working out just swell for them.  Can there be a ( Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc) Joan of Arc spring from among us.  </p>

			<p>Tim in Indiana quotes Farah and then writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is the breakup of the union really such a difficult thing to consider?&rsquo; </p>
<p>Actually, it is. The very roots of this nation lie in the concept of &ldquo;manifest destiny&rdquo; or &ldquo;from sea to shining sea.&rdquo; If race realists try to send out the message that in order to solve our racial problems we must break up this country, it will cause even more resistance to our message. If, however, we deliver the message that if we don&rsquo;t start talking honestly about race it could lead to a breakup, that is a different matter. The one message sends out hope and the other one doesn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>The first great problem post is that Indiana Tim assumes that people give a flip about &#8216;manifest destiny.&rsquo; The good folks I know do not have an abstract love of any such fool concept or of an abstract USA that is an eternal, indivisible constant. Their patriotism is, as the word&rsquo;s etymology demands real patriotism be, for their families and friends and local communities - not for an empire stretching from ocean to ocean.</p>
<p>The second great problem is that Tim fails to see that it was very much that sense of Manifest Destiny that got us to this mess. Manifest Destiny was a major justification for Lincoln and the Republicans refusing to allow the South to secede, which led to the greatest slaughter of whites in this country&rsquo;s history. Without that slaughter, none of this we see today would be as it is. That war cost the lives of seemingly an entire generation of white Southerners, almost all of whom were conservative in every way. It also cost the lives of a latge number of younger white Northerners, at least half of whom were solidly conservative - limp wristed Liberal Yankees tended to sit the War out and plan for Reconstruction, a REPUBLICAN party culture war against the white South.</p>
<p>The third great problem that Tim ignores is demography. When blacks were not more than 10-12% of the population and there were precious other nonwhites, and a definite majority of whites were conservative in most ways (when even pro-black Liberals could admit they felt and acted so because they knew blacks to be inferior intelltually and morally and so required their help), then we could have acted as 48/50 states to prevent mass immigration and never allow affirmative action. Those days are long gone.</p>
<p>What would have better for whites in southern Africa? Trying to keep both Rhodesia and South Africa as white ruled, or making a deal in which Rhodesia became Zimbabawe and South Africa was dovided 50-50, with all whites from all parts of both countries told to move to the new  white half of SA or accept black rule and all blacks told that the white part of SA would never allow them to vote much less hold office.</p>
<p>Stupid greed eventually does everyone in. Retreat and entrench to save the culture. Otherwise, your fate is what whites in Southern African have seen and will continue to see until they are exterminated.</p>

			<p>Should this is ever happen it will likely start as a secession movement by individual states, such as Wyoming or one of the Dakotas. I doubt that the US military has the stomach or will to kill their fellow former citizens in order to force them maintain their loyalty to a union they clearly despise.  Should it come to the use of military force to threaten secessionist states, bear in mind that the overwhelming majority of the combat arms of all the services are white or Hispanic and unlikely to fire on their former citizens.</p>
<p>The US could go the way, and very quickly, of the former USSR.</p>

<p>Absoulutely true. The anti-white Left cannot rest as long as any white people in any land are free from being dictated to by blacks and the white-hating Liberals who control blacks so that they can maintain power over decent whites.</p>

			<p>&#8220;social conservatives to work toward a second parallel society in this country, strictly along conservative ideology, rejecting the rest of the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social conservatives are no friend of whites.  They will not come our against affirmative action, immigration and black on white crime.  They&rsquo;ve totally ignore these issues for 50 years.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, their only issues are abortion, gays, sexual habits etc.</p>
<p>Let one of those southern mega churches preachers come out against affirmative action and black on white crime and I might respect them.</p>
<p>And why should racially aware whites unite with social conservatives anyway?  They have totally lost on every issue.  Abortion is here forever.  Think what a struggle it was to get that law that decreed physicians must give a failed abortion live baby the same treatment other live birth babies get.</p>
<p>And gay issues?  The social conservatives have lost on every issue but gay marriage.  But the courts will institute that soon enough.  </p>
<p>After all it was the courts, not the 1968 quota system civil rights act that turned affirmative action for 12 percent of the population into &#8220;no whites need apply.&#8221;  And it was the courts who made affirmative action apply to every non white immigrant who managed to come here.</p>
<p>America is not ruled by 3 separate powers, legislative, executive and judicial.  America is ruled by the judicial branch.<br>
It is hardly worth while to have legislators make laws any more.</p>
<p>Judges and liberal lawyers backed up by the wealthiest foundations routinely overturn every law that doesn&rsquo;t fit their agenda.  When the liberal can&rsquo;t get their new laws past the legislature, they just file more Ford Foundation funded lawsuits and liberal judges make up a new law.</p>
<p>Did Paul Weyrich make any mention of just how the parrelel conservative society would support itself?  How it would defend itself against black on white crime?  No</p>
<p>The immigrants have their own parrellel societies.  But they are firmly based on economics.  Before we start talking about conservative values, let&rsquo;s start talking about how a parrallel society would support itself.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Lincoln intended shipping BLACK SLAVES out of the country at the end of Civil War but was murdered by Democrats. Its not too late to carry out Lincoln&rsquo;s plan. Every BLACK family would be given $1M, a ID tatoo, and a one way ticket. They may never return. We have the hard working Mexicans to take their place and move into their gutted homes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes Lincoln did. But moving the hard working Mexicans in to take their place would result in the same undesirable results I promise you. Just pulled open the paper this morning and saw gang membership among youth in my city jumped 50% with 98% of that 50% being latino. You don&rsquo;t want that in your community friend. You think the Mexican replacing the black will make everything OK then you need more experience. Come to Los Angeles. We have plenty of experience here for you to gain regarding the hard working Mexican. You&rsquo;ll leave shocked I promise you.</p>

			<p>Separation of Liberals and Conservatives is only common sense!</p>
<p>Ultimately, people with conflicting values and beliefs NEED to separate. </p>
<p>It is in the very nature of modern political liberalism to create a One World government. Even the Oxford Companion to Philosophy acknowledges this fact (see article on Liberalism). Liberalism needs to force its will on the entire world or else it will fail its mission.</p>
<p>The belief in absolute equality requires world unity to enforce itself. </p>
<p>It is only natural for people to split along cultural, religious, racial and language-related lines. Though some of these conflicts can be exacerbated or even rooted in ignorance, there is another factor: the need for environmental support.</p>
<p>A human being has an absolute need, psychologically speaking, to be among like-minded people. Greater peace   &mdash;   including peace of mind   &mdash;   can best be achieved through geographic separation of Liberals and Conservatives; in fact, it is the only way to secure a lasting peace.</p>

<p>  You are so right. They would use cluster bombs, fuel-air explosives anything sort of Atomic bombs to destroy such a nation. Of course, constant propaganda and economic warfare would be tried first. There is no hope in this country until the government collapses into anarchy, but maybe some European country will emerge in the next decades.  </p>

			<p>One way to get new recruits into the White Nationalist movement is to force White Liberals to live among non-whites. Non-Whites are socially conservative,so good-bye homosexual marriage. Also Non-Whites will want to run the show where they are numerous. Good-bye White liberal county and state politicians. White Liberals have no future in America.</p>

<p>But after reading Farrah&rsquo;s article, I would not care for his narrow vision of it.  If he wants to live in a theocracy, then he can go live in Afghanistan or Iran right now, where they already have one.  Frankly, I wouldn&rsquo;t like that. There are better options.

			<p>I have long given much thought to this topic.  We currently are experiencing a Cold Civil War.  There is an American population, but no American people.  The &#8220;red&#8221; and &#8220;blue&#8221; sides clash to produce one large purple bruise.  America, land of divorces, may well soon become a divorced nation.</p>
<p>The one big obstacle is geography.  In the last Civil War, it was loosely the &#8220;North&#8221; vs. the &#8220;South&#8221;.  This time, the coastal urban centers of the Left are widely scattered, as are the midwestern pockets of liberalism.  Even more importantly, the two competing ideologies exist side by side in suburbia.</p>
<p>The Left has much to lose, the Right has little if anything to lose and everything to gain, should we split up.  So, for all the talk of liberals who lyingly vowed to &#8220;leave the country&#8221; when Bush was elected, it will be the Right who initiates the divorce.  Obama&rsquo;s historical role will one day be seen as the instigator of this movement.</p>
<p>Think about it:  the Right includes the geography and mentality of production.  From agriculture to manufacturing to the work ethic itself, the Right will do just fine, whereas the Left will be severely hurting.  Racial problems will all accrue to the Left, who will no longer be able to champion the cause of the oppressed, once they are the ones in charge.  They won&rsquo;t have the right to blame anymore; instead, they will be stuck with the unpleasant realities.  The Left will keep the pathologies, such as drug use and immorality.  The Right will be glad to be largely rid of them.  The Left will try to cross the Right&rsquo;s newly established borders, but not vice versa, which will be a testimony to which side has the superior society.  The Left will uncharacteristically militarize to get what they cannot build on their own.  For the Right are the builders, the Left are the users and takers.</p>
<p>It begins when we on the Right choose to visibly opt out of the Left&rsquo;s usurped establishment.  I cannot foresee how the geographic issue will be overcome - the Left cannot be allowed to unilaterally keep all the cities and areas of natural beauty, and it is possible that the Cold Civil War will turn hot.</p>

If conservatives were allowed to go our own way, who would the lefties have to force to pay for their pie-in-the-sky wealth-redistribution schemes?  The modern welfare state they love so much would completely collapse without the tax money extorted from the productive majority.</p>

			<p>  Mr. Farah is a very insightful man. Yes, it is time, past due time that we divided the country. And yes, we can do it without bloodshed if we ALL try. Needless to say, the libs will still want us to pay their way thru life. There will and must be bloodshed to break away from the leeches. We should give them the southwest. In the southwest, which is already lost, they could all live together and be happy with their mexican masters. Like Xenophone says, sooner or later, preferably much sooner, like right now!</p>

			<p>The best way to legally breakup this nation is to get paleoconservative control of at least 36 state legislatures (2/3rds of states) and call a constitutional convention. The founders wrote this into the constitution and it can be done, especially if under Obama we have foreign and/or economic catastrophes. It can be done.</p>

  <br>
A (Brilliant) Zebra Victims Memorial Speech by Stephen McNallen‏ <br>
From: EaifPresEmeritus@aol.com <br>
Sent: Mon 8/04/08 1:44 PM <br>
To:   </p>
<p><br>
A Call to European-Americans<br>
The following address was written for a Zebra Victims Memorial observance in San Francisco.</p>
<p>My European-American brothers and sisters, it is an honor to speak before you today!<br>
In that simple act of greeting lies the essence of my message - for we ARE brothers and sisters, men and women of one blood, one bone, one spirit, far-flung sons and daughters of the ancient tribes of Europe reunited on this land.</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, the challenges before us are the greatest we have faced in the many millennia of our journey. Our people&rsquo;s heritage is dismissed as the product of &#8220;dead White males.&#8221; Discrimination against us is not only allowed, it is mandated by law. </p>
<p>Our men and women and children are daily victimized by racially-motivated crime, at a rate far greater than any other group - yet the world &#8220;racially profiles&#8221; us as the perpetrators! Our birth rate plummets, our population ages and creaks toward death; we have become a dispossessed majority&hellip;and if you know the demographics, you know that we are well on the way to becoming a repressed minority not only in California but across the country, and around the world.</p>
<p>I shudder when I consider the fate of our grandchildren, or our elders in their helpless years.</p>
<p>What is the answer? Our political leaders refuse to lead. Indeed, they have abandoned us. The Democratic party has given us the mayor of San Francisco - who says he doesn&rsquo;t care about the &#8220;idiot children&#8221; of European-Americans and who repeatedly uses the term &#8220;white boys&#8221; to refer to our men. I hate to think what he calls our women.<br>
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET ANGRY?</p>
<p>The Republicans have given us Ron Unz, a man who can write an article titled &#8220;California and the End of White America&#8221; and leave us with the implication that the end of White America is somehow not so bad, that it is acceptable.</p>
<p>WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET ANGRY?</p>
<p>James Brulte, a leading Republican official in southern California, stated outright that he would not support White males as aspiring candidates in his party.</p>
<p>WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET ANGRY?</p>
<p>When are we as European-Americans going to realize that we have been HAD by the current managers of the political system?</p>
<p>In justified anger and in frustration, we search for answers. But the first answer must come from within - a spiritual answer. We lost the political battles years ago, decades ago, as those who hate us made their &#8220;long march through the institutions&#8221; of academia, law, art, and literature. </p>
<p>We have been routed from those places of power, and we will not easily regain them. We must start at a more basic level, the level of you and me, the level of attitudes and values. We must change ourselves, and then change others. And the good news is, we can start to do this today, and every day, without passing a law or getting a permit.</p>
<p>First, we must learn to love ourselves! We must reject, wholly and emphatically, the guilt that our enemies would lay on us. We must feel our goodness, take pride in our achievements, and stand tall with firm self-respect.</p>
<p>As we learn to care about ourselves, we must learn to love our European-American brothers and sisters. We must understand that we don&rsquo;t have to like each other as individuals, but that, paradoxically, we must love each other if we are to survive. Our differences of opinion and habit and taste shrink before our common heritage and our common interest. </p>
<p>We must help each other, support each other, hire each other, trade with each other, discriminate in favor of each other in every facet of our lives.</p>
<p>Having decided that we are worthy of self respect, and having opened our hands and our hearts to our extended family of Eurofolk, we must turn to our ancestors - that long line stretching away into the mists of time, gone from us yet always with us - and honor them. They live in us, as we will live in our descendants. We have an ancient and powerful reservoir of might on which to draw. Have you ever stopped to consider that each and every one of us standing here is the latest in a long line of winners? It&rsquo;s true: </p>
<p>If a single one of your direct ancestors had died before having children, that golden chain of ancestry would have been snapped. Our forebears were tough and smart. They had to be, or they would not have survived. We, too, are tough and smart, and we will need all that smartness and toughness in the coming years.</p>
<p>It is not fashionable to think of ancestors as mattering. But I say to you - our ancestors watch, and they and history will pass judgment on what we do, or do not do, in the months and years and decades to come.</p>
<p>Finally, we must link to this land, because there are those who would push us off it. Activist and Democratic Party official Art Torres crowed about &#8220;the last gasp of White America in California.&#8221; Another minority racist well known in political circles, Mario Obledo, said outright that California will be a Hispanic state and that anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like it, should leave. Sorry, Art! Sorry, Mario! Our roots are in this land! We will not run. </p>
<p>We will stand here, fighting for our rights, our culture, our heritage, our people. We will not abandon the graves of our ancestors!</p>
<p>My kinsmen, I said at the beginning of this address that we face the greatest challenge in our existence as a people. But that should not dismay us. Rather, it is an honor to be alive in this time, to take part in our historic task, to safeguard our people in this age of crisis. The blood of heroes runs in your veins. I ask you, here and now, to listen to that bloodsong and make a commitment. </p>
<p>Before your feet leave the place where you now stand, I ask you to look into your heart and decide that you will not submit to our dispossession, our dissolution, as a people! What will you do today to respect yourself as a European-American? What will you do today to help your European-American brothers and sisters? </p>
<p>What will you do today to link with your ancestors? What will you do today to sink your roots deeply and immovably in this sacred soil? You don&rsquo;t need anyone&rsquo;s permission or approval to do these things, all it takes is will and love.</p>

			<p>An enticing idea, but impractical for two reasons:</p>
<p>1) The &#8220;Red Nation&#8221; would be much more successful, both in terms of economics and quality of life.  Without intelligent &amp; hardworking people to tax, the &#8220;Blue Nation&#8221; would quickly collapse into 3rd World anarchy.  So everyone would emmigrate to the Red Nation, and we&rsquo;d be back where we started.  Look at what happens when liberals from states like California and Massachussets move to conservative states like Idaho and New Hampshire.</p>
<p>2) If the Red Nation is successful but displays even a HINT of white nationalism, the rest of the world will come down on it like a ton of bricks.  Look what happened to South Africa and Rhodesia.  The global elites will strangle the Red Nation with sanctions and boycots, and shower the Blue Nation with subsidies.</p>

			<p>The best you can realistically hope for is that Russia/China nukes the USA. It would destroy all the big cities and wipe out 90% of all liberals (who really are marxists in liberal disguise) and most of the coloreds as well. It is not as unrealistical as you think, both Obama and Mccain are neoconservative puppets, and the subjugation of Russia is a major goal for their neoconservative masters, and they just might go one step too far, especially if they believe the ABM shield works. But what if the russians have effective countermeasures against it? </p>

			<p>Seccession is not plausible.  We are too mixed.  As others have noted, Red and Blue elements are everywhere.  The logistics of a peaceful, organized separation would require untold billions of dollars and a couple of generations to complete.  Getting even a general agreement on separation (i.e. who gets what and where) would take decades.</p>
<p>Balkanization is what is coming.  Take a look at a map of Bosnia.  Ed Steele has a map of a balkanized America on his website that is worth glancing at as well.  It will be neither peaceful nor organized.  This is our future.  </p>

			<p>Posted by HH: &#8220;What we(White/European peoples) need to do is stop worrying about ceturies old constitutions and declarations and various governmental dogmas of bygone eras and start afresh! The US Constitution is wielded AGAINST our people today, just as often as it may ever protect. Away with it!&#8221;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more. I want this country to fall, but I don&rsquo;t want it to become another far-fetched utopian idea as it is now. Many people on the right honestly believe that we can turn this country into some type of Judeo-Christian Fantasy Land. They live in a dream world about what America supposedly used to be like. It&rsquo;s time for the White World to start fresh. We need new ideas. The old ones clearly failed. I want a White Society based on rational ideas, and the commitment to the survival of our race. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Please, dear Lord God, lead us to secede from this abomination created by America&rsquo;s Elites, an abomination that makes the most crime ridden, incompetent, and politically corrupt races effectively sacred - &#8220;</p>
<p><br>
Unless you take precautions (and I see no evidence of it), don&rsquo;t you think those same &#8220;elites&#8221; will infiltrate you, gain economic and political control (very subtly, of course), and within two or three generations you&rsquo;ll be in the same predicament all over again?  In other words, the same way as they already got control here.</p>

<p>Not race-based?   Then what&rsquo;s the purpose?  <br>
If it isn&rsquo;t, then he and his proposition are of no interest to me!  </p>

			<p>Another secession article and more flights of fancy&hellip;.<br>
I agree but also the first thing to do is to create a third party movement based on the ideas of secession and we will be accorded the visibility that is deserved. The secessionist feeling is definitely there but it must be formally announced. I don&rsquo;t see way a political party can be legally deterred in this country. As the chaos of a fractured society becomes more and more apparent the party itself (whatever it calls itself) will be the antidote to the illness of the larger society. Recast the electoral process to reflect how people actually feel&hellip;and polls indicate fully 20 percent of the people want secession. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Should this is ever happen it will likely start as a secession movement by individual states, such as Wyoming or one of the Dakotas. I doubt that the US military has the stomach or will to kill their fellow former citizens in order to force them maintain their loyalty to a union they clearly despise. Should it come to the use of military force to threaten secessionist states, bear in mind that the overwhelming majority of the combat arms of all the services are white or Hispanic and unlikely to fire on their former citizens.</p>
<p>The US could go the way, and very quickly, of the former USSR.</p>

<p>john is WRONG when he writes, &#8220;I doubt that the US military has the stomach or will to kill their fellow former citizens in order to force them maintain their loyalty to a union they clearly despise.&#8221; See the War Between the States and Reconstruction. If not for that willingness to slaughter white Americans to FORCE them to stay in the Union, we would not be in this mess. All promotion of the black race by the Federal Government proceeds from that long process by which the Liberal northeastern Elites waged war, physical and cultural, on the most conservative people in these United States, using blacks as their pawns and weapons.</p>

			<p>Response to Gray Ghost:</p>
<p>Please explain in detail how you propose to secede from the Union or solve ANY of these problems. If you&rsquo;re talking about a state secession movement, can you name a few in existence which have a chance of succeeding? I&rsquo;d also like to hear specifics about how a Free State would (1) purge itself of minorities, and (2) support itself economically. Take Missouri or Indiana, for instance. They&rsquo;re landlocked. How could a &#8220;Free Missouri&#8221; survive as an independent state surrounded by the rest of the country? How about foreign alignments? The Alaska Independence Movement, for example, has been talking about aligning with Canada of all places. Personally, I can&rsquo;t see the point in separating from the United States only to bind yourself to a Social Marxist police state like Canada. At any rate, please let us know exactly what we are supposed to be doing to either secede or to fight the existing problems. Be specific, please. Saying that we&rsquo;re &#8220;afraid of freedom and self government&#8221; is not only insulting and incorrect, but makes me think that you haven&rsquo;t thought any of this through. And speaking of &#8220;self government,&#8221; what kind of government would you propose? What about taxes? Would they go up? Go down? Please be specific. And going back to the Missouri example, let&rsquo;s say Missouri seceded. Assuming the new Missouri is now a &#8220;white nation&#8221; or wants to be, what would you do about all the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of blacks in St. Louis and Kansas City? Details, please. Instead of berating us for our cowardice, tell us what we should be doing. </p>

			<p>&#8220;One of the reasons that the Soviet Union broke apart were the differences in ethnicity and language.&#8221;</p>
<p>True. The Soviet Empire kept it all together by force and when the Soviets cracked up, everybody took advantage of their weakness to break away and establish their own states. More accurately, they RESTORED their own states.</p>
<p>I guess the Federal government in the States is in more or less the same role as the Soviet regime in Russia, riding herd over the rest of the states. If the Feds vanished, we&rsquo;d be back where we were supposed to be: a decentralized confederation of semi-autonomous states. This is how this country was set up.</p>
<p>Worrying about secession, if you ask me, is misdirected  &mdash;  a waste of time and energy. The problem is the Federal government. They&rsquo;re the key to this puzzle. We&rsquo;ve got a good system here or we would have if it hadn&rsquo;t been so distorted by the out-of-control growth of that malignant tumor in Washington DC. Radical surgery is required.</p>

			<p>  We don&rsquo;t need to break up into two countries. Just protect white neighborhoods and schools at ALL costs. Sure, there are a lot of broken white neighborhoods but there are also thousands still intact. We must keep them that way. If we have to fight to maintain white culture, so be it. Anything worth having is worth fighting for. I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way. Neighborhood councils will have to spring up to accomplish this. However once underway it will gather momentum like a snowball rolling downhill. So, white people start hunkering down, protect your communities! </p>

			<p>The only problem with Farah&rsquo;s position and suggestion that we should divide is the dependent half is not about to let the productive half leave.  They&rsquo;d be dead without us and they know it.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s whole platform, such as it is, is about taking from those who have earned what they have and giving it to those who haven&rsquo;t.  That he&rsquo;s leading in most of the polls would seem to indicate that about half the nation seems to like this Marxist suggestion.</p>

<p><br>
If left alone from government tempering and social engineering, those neighborhoods,  within 15 years, would  sort themselves out and re-segregate again as they were before. This would be a perfectly natural process as people chose to live where they could be among their own people. It is only the force of government that is preventing this normal process from happening.</p>

			<p>When we break up (for we shall, it is inevitable) the realization will soon come that this is not a GEOGRAPHIC split ( as the late &#8216;war between the states&rsquo; was) but an IDEOLOGICAL one. And because it is ideological, no side is willing to be ceded the Mojave Desert to live in, while we keep Santa Barbara, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, WAR will be the ONLY solution. That means we must understand that it will be either &#8216;them or us&rsquo; conflagration, as Shrub put it some years ago. Am I advocating such? Not if by that you mean inciting to riot, etc. I am a peaceloving Christian&hellip; but I am also an American, and our national history as White men of European descent clearly posits that we will defend our nation, &#8216;from all enemies, foreign or domestic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Are you willing to die for Liberalism, or for Christ? The Wars that enabled Columbus to find the New World just as the &#8220;Other&#8221; were expelled from Catholic Spain, the war that sought to maintain state&rsquo;s rights in 1860, the war that made Russia endure 70+ years of atheistic Bolshevism, is the same war we are talking about.</p>
<p>Are you ready? Or are you going to debate the fine points of why it is not needed, when it is at your doors? Or, are the riots over Obama merely empty rhetoric?</p>
<p>Ummm, yeah.</p>

			<p>To posted at 1:55pm Oct 23.  The first thing we must do is free our mind of the conditions which imprison us. For instance, Missouri is landlocked. Physical obstacles can be overcome. I notice an abundance of water tributaries and large air space within the States boundaries. Are we to believe these are handicaps? What about railways? You do have those don&rsquo;t you? As for as food. Some of the best farmland and dairy producers are already present. So lets see. You have food production, good water sources and of course air to breath. I personally don&rsquo;t know all of Missouri&rsquo;s&rsquo; natural resources. But oil products will play a significant role in an industrial society. If oil is not plentiful, it can be imported with &#8220;real free&#8221; trade. If not, fuel can be made from grain and other products. So far, we have food, water, air and some form of fuel product. Now for the people who will be the protectors and productive citisens. Separation will begin in &#8220;parts and pieces&#8221;. Like minded people are drawn to each other by nature. These people will congregate in self-sufficient communities. Voluntary forces will protect the people and resources of that community. I think we call those townships. Laws will be established by the inhabitants of the towns. Law and order will be maintained not only by citisen constables, but also law abiding citisens. When this is accomplished. The unproductive and lawless will move elsewhere. To explain a certain plan for a specific area is easier said than done. But should we submit mind and body to the state through the coercive force of government? If you are satisfied with your status as &#8220;taxpayer&#8221; instead of a worthy citisen with full and unrestrained God given rights. I&rsquo;m sure they have a place for you in their system. I am not satisfied with being a second class citisen and referred to as a &#8220;taxpayer&#8221; by those in the government. I take offense to see my family suffer in a Godless and lawless society. The choice is upon us. The decisions are being made. Submit or Secede&hellip;</p>
