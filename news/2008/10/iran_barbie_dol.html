				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adnkronos International, September 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Iranian children seem to prefer the popular western dolls, Barbie and Ken, rather than the Islamic Dara and Sara dolls, that were created to instill Islamic values.</p>
<p>&#8220;This data is a clear sign of a failed policy adopted by the government with the aim of stopping the western cultural invasion,&#8221; said website &lsquo;Tabnak&rsquo;, which is close to Mohsen Rezaii, former commander of Iran&rsquo;s Revolutionary Guards.</p>
<p>The Dara and Sara dolls are modestly dressed and wear Islamic garments, but have failed to make a name for themselves unlike their &lsquo;western&rsquo; counterparts, Barbie and Ken, which can be found in one out of every two Iranian children&rsquo;s rucksacks and notebooks, claimed Tabnak.</p>
<p>Dara and Sara were marketed by the Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults, a government agency with links to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<blockquote>

			<p>What a paradox. If the world loves white people so much, why are they trying to destroy us? Probably has something to with IQ. As a white person, I recognize that Asians on average are more intelligent than whites. I have no desire do mix with them, but I recognize their value to the world. I believe that the world wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without Asians. I believe the same about Jews. It shows how unintelligent some of the other races are when they fail to see what a benefit white people are to the world. There&rsquo;s an old saying about Montana. It says something to the effect of &#8220;If you love it, leave it&#8221;. If the rest of the world loves the benefits that white societies create, they should stay away so those societies can continue. No other race is capable of producing the same types of civilizations that whites do. Since they obviously love what our civilizations provide, they should stay in their own parts of the world and learn to emulate us.</p>

			<p>Iranians (in general)are Caucasians. Asia is a only a geographic label. They donÂ´t &#8220;like&#8221; or &#8220;dislike&#8221; &#8220;white people&#8221;. They think in themselves like &#8220;whites&#8221;. In fact, they built the first &#8220;Great White Empire&#8221;, Persia. <br>
Besides, if the Mongolian Race (what you call &#8220;Asian&#8221;)is superior, why the Civilization started in Midle East, populated by Caucasians-Whites? <br>
Which kind of Asians do you think that are Semites like Isaelites and Assirians, or Indo-Europeans (Arians) like Hittites or Persians?  </p>

			<p>What is not generally known is that Dara and Sara are both &#8216;speaking dolls&rsquo; in the sense that if a small cord with toggle located near to their throats are pulled, an internal grampohone mechanism allows the dolls to utter few phrases.<br>
  - Only no-one has ever plucked up the courage to pull the cord.</p>

			<p>Some Persians may have pale skin, but that&rsquo;s as far as the similarities with whites goes. </p>
<p>They are very different from us, and I&rsquo;ve not met an Iranian living in the West who didn&rsquo;t confirm that.  </p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a similar &#8220;study&#8221; done in the states:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_2919.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_2919.shtml</a></p>
<p>&hellip; it&rsquo;s a lousy study but does imply that lighter complexions are considered more attractive even among black children.  Of course leftists see this as something to be fixed.  I wonder what their take is on the Iran situation.</p>

			<p>IMO, implying that the preference for a white doll over an arab one because of the unpopularity of Sara is a stretch.<br>
Dara and Sara, according to Wikipedia etc, were introduced in 2002, while Barbie had almost half a century to build up a fan base.</p>

			<p>FOr the first poster, let me remind you that civilizations did exist in other races until the white man did it.  The white man is the most destructive specie that evolution has created. Thats is why religion was invented to control them.   They are not very smart people, more prone to jealousy so you have to brainwashed them from an early age there is a higher being that controls them.</p>
<p>They are prone to backstabbings and stealing other people ideas.  </p>
<p>I wonder what we have accomplished more if the civilizations were not destroyed by this scourge of the earth.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What a paradox. If the world loves white people so much, why are they trying to destroy us?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer is it&rsquo;s not a paradox at all.  The world of non-whites WANT to be like Whites.  They want TO BE White.  They are jealous that they themselves are not or were not born White.  They are sensing Europe&rsquo;s and America&rsquo;s weakness right now and they don&rsquo;t have to be politicians to know that America is fast weakening what with unchecked legal and illegal immigration and Whites fighting each other and calling other Whites racist if they don&rsquo;t want a flood of 3rd-worlders entering their country.  To put it briefly   &mdash;  THEY WANT WHAT WE HAVE.  They sense our weaknesses and are moving in for the kill so-to-speak.  We are better than them in their minds - on a looks basis and also intellectually - but we have these terrible weaknesses of nobles oblige and a penchant for falling for the conditioning that the media masters have programmed into us to accept our own racial destruction.  </p>
<p>So no paradox at all.  They want what we have and they see an opportunity or opportunities now to take it from us and destroy us.</p>

They are prone to backstabbings and stealing other people[&rsquo;s] ideas.&#8221;<br>

I&rsquo;m white, and I fit few, if any of Liz&rsquo; generalizations about my race and gender.  I&rsquo;m a pretty smart guy, not particularly prone to jealousy, not subject to backstabbing others, and I can&rsquo;t think of any ideas that I&rsquo;ve stolen from another person.  If anything, I&rsquo;m polite and deferential to a fault.  <br>
Liz, I fear, may be fighting demons that are unseen to the rest of us.</p>

			<p>Actually the islamic version of the doll is still much more popular among adults buying gifts for children.  It is Iranian men who are buying up all the white blond dolls for themselves.  </p>

			<p>Liz may consider herself invited to divest her life of everything that owes its origins to white men. She&rsquo;ll have to abandon electricity, running water, modern medicine, computers, and myriad other things, but I&rsquo;m sure it will be worth it.</p>

			<p>Funny, I, too, am a White Man, and a Christian, and I never heard that White Men &#8216;invented&rsquo; religion to &#8216;control them.&rsquo; </p>
<p>I always was taught, and teach myself that God, in His great Mercy, incarnated Himself to be &#8216;just as we are, yet without sin&rsquo; to die for His People. [Matt. 1:21] That&rsquo;s not control, that&rsquo;s LOVE.</p>
<p>As Belloc noted of that, &#8220;Europe is the Faith; the Faith, Europe.&#8221;<br>
In case you ever wondered who the &#8220;His People&#8221; is&hellip;.</p>
<p>I believe Liz has her facts skewed&hellip;probably from a liberal university professor who actually believe he is &#8216;god.&rsquo; She can go worship him&hellip;.</p>

Which kind of Asians do you think that are Semites like Isaelites and Assirians, or Indo-Europeans (Arians) like Hittites or Persians?</p>
<p>As the poster of the article you seem to be taking on, allow me to retort? First of all; Persians are close to whites, but they aren&rsquo;t white. When I say white, I&rsquo;m not just speaking of skin color. I mean white people of &#8220;European descent&#8221;. There are Iranians who have white skin, but that&rsquo;s as far as it goes. Second; when I say Asian, I&rsquo;m refering to &#8220;East Asians&#8221;, specifically &#8220;Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc&hellip;&#8221;. Third; I never said that Asians are superior to Whites, I simply said that the average Asian has a higher IQ than the average white person. Anyone who has read this site or any research on IQ knows that this is an un-deniable fact. If you believe that higher IQ means superior, then that&rsquo;s your personal opinion. Don&rsquo;t ascrbie beliefs to me that I never said. I believe that high IQ is just one part of a successful people. Fourth; when I speak of Jews, I&rsquo;m refering to Jewish people of European ancestry. They are for all practical purposes white. They do have slight physical variations; and many of them maintain a seperate culture from whites, which is why I put them in their own category. I apologize for any confusion that my racial-generalizations have caused you. I hope that this clarifies my position for you. Please feel free to respond.</p>
