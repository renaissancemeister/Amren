				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gillian Gaynair, AP, September 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the racially diverse Washington suburb of Greenbelt, the term &#8220;progressive&#8221; is a badge of honor. But the city that began as a New Deal-era cooperative and overwhelmingly voted for Barack Obama has never had a minority serve on its council in its 71-year history.</p>
<p>The gap has drawn the attention of the U.S. Justice Department and civil rights activists and is remarkable for Prince George&rsquo;s County, well known for its middle- and upper-middle-class black communities.</p>
<p>But even some residents who see a problem don&rsquo;t blame racism. Rather, they describe a chasm between the older, central Greenbelt, which is still mostly white and politically active, and the newer, outlying neighborhoods, where most of the city&rsquo;s minorities live and vote less often in city elections.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland and the county NAACP suggest that Greenbelt&rsquo;s at-large election system &mdash; in which all residents can vote for all the seats &mdash; is to blame. They claim it dilutes the minority vote and discourages minority participation, which violates the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>They also contend that turnout is low in more diverse neighborhoods because local elections don&rsquo;t coincide with state and federal races.</p>
<p>Some longtime residents bristle at suggestions that Greenbelt is unfair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are these outsiders who know nothing really about our community and the demographics and all of that, and they&rsquo;re telling us how we ought to act and want to change our government system,&#8221; said 88-year-old Virginia Beauchamp, who has lived in Greenbelt since 1957 and said she participated in restaurant sit-ins in 1952 in Missouri.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s all a great irony,&#8221; said Cathy Knepper, author of a book about the city&rsquo;s legacy said of the current spotlight on Greenbelt. &#8220;It has always been liberal and considered left-wing, or even socialist.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t they know you must elect a non-white to not be considered racist. The NAACP is a joke, their terror of words by calling any one racist if they don&rsquo;t do what the NAACP is coming to a end. </p>

			<p>So blacks can&rsquo;t even get themselves elected in areas where it should be a cake walk/ What does that tell us?</p>
<p>This reminds me of an interesting election I read about a few years ago. Seems there was a local election to fill some minor position and only one candidate (a black guy) filed for the seat. The law was that as long as he received at least one vote, he would be elected.</p>
<p>Well, as things turned out, he didn&rsquo;t vote, his wife forgot to, and nobody else bothered casting a vote, so he wound up losing an uncontested race. (He was later appointed to the position by whoever had authority to do it.)</p>

			<p>I live close-by.  Old Town Greenbelt is a cozy old place, about half working class whites, half old hippies.  A few minorities I guess, but not too many.  Sometimes I walk around the town center, with its various co-ops and small businesses, and imagine that this is what an all-white, Scandinavian-style socialist America might have looked like.  Nothing fancy, but safe (as far as I can tell), cheap and pleasant.  A breath of fresh air in the multicultural dystopia of metro DC.  </p>
<p>Damn, I hope it stays that way!  </p>

			<p>Just more proof you can never, NEVER make Blacks happy&hellip;never! No matter how liberal/progressive, no matter how much fawning, how much outreach, uplift, access, opportunity, diversity, or affirmative action is lavished on these people - it is just never enough! </p>

			<p>This is in House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer&rsquo;s district.</p>
<p>The reason they&rsquo;re being accused of racism is precisely because they&rsquo;re that liberal.  The good &#8220;progressive&#8221; whites of the People&rsquo;s Republic of Maryland have thus exposed their weakness, and thus opened themselves up to these charges.  For those making the charges know that &#8220;progressive&#8221; communes like Greenbeltgrad will be far more likely to bend.</p>

			<p>The progressive Greenbelters and their kind have been intrusive outsiders to most of the rest of the country.  It&rsquo;s good thing for the Feds to look under their skirts.  I hope they&rsquo;re forced to integrate every block in town, let them enjoy diversity up close.  </p>

			<p>This article is so rich that it&rsquo;s suitable for framing.  </p>
<p>That there is a double standard among leftists, see also liberals, is no secret.  To them, self-destructive minorities are their pets to be nurtured and parented by mother government.  They love humanity but hate people, and heaven forbid the thought of those they care for so much should live near them. </p>

			<p>Greenbelt definitely has too many enemies, who want to destroy the town by bringing &#8216;the bright minority&rsquo; in power. Once you have these &#8216;shimarts&rsquo; around   &mdash;   the good life is gone.<br>

			<p>This article makes it clear: for blacks, it&rsquo;s not about ideology   &mdash;   it is, and has always been, about race and its relation to power.  That the city government is all but communist matters little if they do not have their hands on the taxpayer&rsquo;s money.  </p>

			<p>I grew up in the DC area and know the Greenbelt area very well. There is nothing &#8216;diverse&rsquo; about Greenbelt except the shade of black a person is.</p>
<p>The fact that a black has not served on the council in its 70 year history, and considering that Greenbelt has been majority black for over 20 of these years, illustrates the ineptitude of blacks in general, and the lunacy of an impending Obama administration.</p>

<p>One thing that I think is becoming clearer and clearer is that a socialist model, if it can function at all, can only work in the context of completely homogeneous society consisting of Northern Europeans   &mdash;   far and away the most altruistic and egalitarian of the world&rsquo;s peoples   &mdash;   and even there has insidious side effects that may doom it in the long run.  Among almost any other race, the temptation to corruption is simply too great.  Meanwhile, the introduction of non-white elements into a white socialist society undermines the trust and common identity that keep socialism working in the first place.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as others have pointed out, these white &#8220;progressives&#8221; are their own worst enemy, as they repeatedly extend their altruism to hostile groups who will never return the favor and who may, in time, destroy them.  This habit, when reinforced by white guilt, also makes them highly susceptible to racial threats and intimidation   &mdash;   as appears to be happening in Greenbelt.</p>

			<p>Accusations that the election excludes minorities?  How can liberals let this happen, and so close to home at that?<br>
Now the questions become, which liberal politician will be the first to step forward and volunteer to give up their seat to a minority?  And if none steps forward, which ones will have their areas diluted through racial gerrymandering so as to allow an increase in minority representation?  I&rsquo;d love to be a fly on the wall during their closed door discussions on this dilemma.  HILARIOUS!!!</p>
<p>Also of note is the timing of these complaints.  I mean, wasn&rsquo;t this entire financial meltdown started when minorities complained about being excluded from home loans?  We are now witnessing yet another example of what happens when caving to minority demands. Hopefully this town will find the same level of success that their tolerance has bestowed upon the rest of us.  Afterall, it couldn&rsquo;t happen to a more deserving group of people.</p>

			<p>In checking this out (on Wiki), I learned that:</p>
<p>&#8220;While the present city population is racially diverse, only two African Americans have run for Council in the past 30 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what do they expect?</p>

			<p>Anybody who thinks that Greenbelt is still some sort of socialist utopia has no idea what&rsquo;s going on in the town. Take a look at these videos. Gangs of black youths are systematically attacking white males all over the city, raiding houses, and committing robberies:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od1ds6klR_k" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od1ds6klR_k</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5jF_VRlk_k" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5jF_VRlk_k</a></p>
<p>The white old center section of town is being ethnically cleansed. While whites are in the majority in the center section, all one sees playing basketball at the recreational facilities there is blacks. Blacks also commit more than 90% of the crime.</p>
<p>For the past several decades, Greenbelt has won tons of awards for how well run it is, from the state, from the region, and nationally. It is one of the best-run cities in the world, but it is being encroached on by some very hideous elements from the rest of the county.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Cheye Calvo, the white mayor of the predominantly white town of Berwyn Heights, who had his house raided by a swat team and had his dogs shot, lives just a few hundred yards away from Greenbelt. The police chief and sherrif of Prince George&rsquo;s County are both black, and they both authorized the raid. If you don&rsquo;t know the story, look it up, it will make you sick.</p>
<p>This is nothing more than ethnic cleansing. The black &#8220;youths&#8221; are taking their marching orders from their preachers and their &#8220;community orgainzers,&#8221; backed by the leftist ACLU and NAACP. Those two organizations see an easy mark and initiate lawsuits like this to fund their organization  &mdash;   they get money whether they win or lose!</p>
<p>The local paper is full of Marxists who refuse to report on the crime problem. There was a local blogger who tried to chronicle what was going on with the city (he did the videos), but he was stopped by the threat of lawsuits.</p>
<p>Also, in another version of the article that I&rsquo;ve seen, a black woman is accusing the city of being racist because the farmer&rsquo;s market is held on Sundays from 10-2. She said that black people go to church then and spend a lot of time there, and why didn&rsquo;t they take that into consideration when they scheduled the market? Turns out the city didn&rsquo;t create the market, that was done by volunteers, and that was the only time the vendors weren&rsquo;t busy at other markets. Like you say, you can&rsquo;t freaking win with some people.</p>

<p>Hey!  Stop being so logical.  It&rsquo;s obvious it&rsquo;s the fault of racist whites, and inconvenient facts like that are not at all helpful.  Besides, if they didn&rsquo;t run its only more proof that whites are so racist that blacks know they have no chance and don&rsquo;t waste their time trying.  <br>

  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
If you don&rsquo;t run for office, you&rsquo;re not going to be elected! </p>
<p>As Dave said above,  it seems that an egalitarian socialist model can only function in the context of a homogeneous society of certain types of  related people  (I would include perhaps Japanese and Koreans) living among their own kind.   I agree. </p>
<p>I would extend that  observation to ask whether democracy itself  is suited to blacks.  It&rsquo;s a valid question.  Is there anyplace  in the world where they have such a society, established on their own?   Even when they inherit such a  governmental framework, it quickly degenerates into  nepotism, corruption and tyranny.    </p>
<p>When it comes to democracy (a white invention), <b> blacks want all the benefits without any of the bother.  </b>  They don&rsquo;t want to waste time serving on committees. They can&rsquo;t be bothered to vote.  They&rsquo;re not interested in researching the issues.   Yet they complain when they&rsquo; don&rsquo;t see any of their own getting elected!   Like children, they expect the benefits without the responsibilities.  They are irrational. </p>

<p>You may be right.  My relatives are upper-middle class from Finland, pay something like 60% of their income in taxes, and I have always thought they lived just about the best life imaginable.  But now over there you see some of the same signs of breakdown that we have here, including loads of spoiled, clueless, disaffected young people.  </p>
<p>I still think the problem is primarily cultural, rather than having to do with this or that economic system.  </p>
<p>Regarding the Greenbelt situation, this is the sort of stuff that really worries me about an Obama administration: appointees at the Department of Justice running amok on civil rights crusades.  </p>

			<p>The &#8220;old part&#8221; of Greenbelt is white because one cannot buy a townhouse in this area using FHA or VA loans, and must put down a hefty down payment.  The newer part of Greenbelt has historically had a significant white population because of the proximity to NASA.  Sadly, this has changed over the last decade.</p>
<p>But honestly, the foolish white liberals of Greenbelt, as well as nearby Takoma Park, are reaping what they have sown - championing the causes of the minorities - who used to live in someone else&rsquo;s neighborhood!</p>

<p>88 years old and still as clueless as ever.  I have an aunt like this in her 70s.  It&rsquo;s all feelings with these people; what she did felt right in 1952 and it still feels right today, facts be damned.  </p>

			<p><i>One thing that I think is becoming clearer and clearer is that a socialist model, if it can function at all, can only work in the context of completely homogeneous society consisting of Northern Europeans  &mdash;  far and away the most altruistic and egalitarian of the world&rsquo;s peoples  &mdash;  and even there has insidious side effects that may doom it in the long run. </i></p>
<p>The Scandanavian model isn&rsquo;t &#8220;socialist&#8221; in the marxist meaning of the word at all.  And it&rsquo;s not really true that only nothern-Europeans can &#8220;do&#8221; high-tax, controlled economies. Anyone can &#8220;do&#8221; them, they just can&rsquo;t do them <i>as well</i>.  Homogeneity is the key to a healthy, high-tax controlled economy, whether it&rsquo;s &#8220;democratic&#8221; or not.  Without homogeneity, geographic division of ethnic groups is the next best thing.  For example, Baathist Iraq   &mdash;   all Iraqi groups were <i>infinitely</i> better off under the Baath party than the cosmically idiotic &#8220;western&#8221; model we have criminally attempted to impose on them.  Indeed, it&rsquo;s America that could learn from Sadaam, not the Iraqis from us   &mdash;   if only Americans could realize our devotion to growth-at-all-costs capitalism is what&rsquo;s killing us and allows our hopelessly corrupt leaders to treat us as they do (maybe the&rsquo;ve seen Latin America and figured &#8220;it works&#8221;?).</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t say! Maybe you now know how the white Southerners felt when you were telling them how to live with blacks 50 years ago.</p>

			<p>The city just held their third meeting to discuss this issue with the citizens. The meetings were held in all areas of the city, so that all could attend, and they were heavily publicised.</p>
<p>Many, many white liberal citizens came forth who said that they had been members of the ACLU and NAACP, and were quitting those groups in disgust. In all those meetings with well over a hundred speakers, only ONE  &mdash;   repeat ONE  &mdash;   non-white individual came up to the microphone and agreed with the ACLU/NAACP.</p>
<p>This is an attempt by NAACP/ACLU to fund themselves via lawsuit, as Maryland law stipulates that anyone who brings forth such a suit, whether they win or lose, at least gets their attorney&rsquo;s fees paid by the entity they make the complaint against. If they win such a suit, of course, they could get millions.</p>
<p>Lots of liberals in Greenbelt have gotten a big splash of ice-cold reality right in the face. Whether it will result in a breakout of common sense is doubtful.</p>

Thanks, Michael T.  This mindless mania for endless growth is insane and unsustainable.  </p>
<p>And yes,  at least one of our  (ahem)  &#8220;leaders&#8221; has seen Latin America and, second to the White House, he&rsquo;s known for liking it very much. He wishes we could be more like that.</p>

			<p>I grew up five minutes up the road in Seabrook.  Most of the towns in this part of Prince George&rsquo;s County are about 25 % white, most of the white being over sixty years of age.  Forty years ago, this part of Prince George&rsquo;s County was  monolithically white.  School busing, foisted onto the residents in 1973, was the catlyst of demographic change for Prince George&rsquo;s.  White flight began soon thereafter and has cascaded since 1990.  Greenbelt may be a little whiter than towns like Riverdale(heavily Hispanic), New Carrollton, Seabrook, Bladensburg(also heavily Hispanic) due to its close proximity to the University of Maryland at College Park(one of the ugliest university towns in America) and that its housing stock is relatively affordable for the college professoriate.</p>
