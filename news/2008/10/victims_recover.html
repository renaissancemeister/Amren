<h1>Victims Recovering From Stabbing Spree</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aftenposten (Norway), Oct. 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Four persons stabbed in downtown Oslo Tuesday night by a man with a record of violence were in stable condition after their frightening ordeal. Their attacker was in police custody and being held at a psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p>The stabbing drama suddenly played out around the Gunerius shopping complex around 9am Tuesday.</p>
<p>One witness said he and his wife were walking down the pedestrian street Brugata after a theater visit, when a man came walking &ldquo;quietly and calmly&rdquo; towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly he raised his arm and he was holding a big Rambo-like knife,&rdquo; the man told Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK). &ldquo;My wife yelled &lsquo;RUN,&rsquo; and we ran into a nearby café and yelled for everyone to stay inside and call the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knife-wielding man proceeded to go on a stabbing spree, randomly assaulting passersby including one woman who was stabbed in the throat, a man whom he stabbed in the arm and another man who was stabbed while waiting for the tram in Storgata. </p>
<p>Police were finally able to apprehend the assailant, a 36-year-old man from Somalia, inside a local parking garage. He has a police record after earlier incidents involving possession of narcotics and violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be wrong to say he was arrested without any drama,&rdquo; Lasse Alver of the Oslo Police District told Aftenposten.no. &ldquo;It seemed as though he was trying to attack everyone and anyone he came across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two persons were sent to Ullevål Hospital while two others were treated at a local emergency clinic. </p>
<p>One witness said the man had been carrying the knife in a plastic bag, and pulled it out as he encountered potential victims. He ultimately threw the knife down and ran. &ldquo;He seemed unstable,&rdquo; said Alver after the arrest was made. &ldquo;He just wanted to attack anyone he saw.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s surprising that they revealed his Somali origin.  </p>
<p>Much of the mainstrean media abides by a self-imposed policy of hiding truths about the ethnic component of crime, lest it make citizens wary of foreigners.  </p>

I guess so.  Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful? The Norwegians are enjoying all the rich blessings of Diversity.  Lucky them!</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m very, very surprised that the article even mentioned that he was &#8220;black&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oh no, in fact It didn&rsquo;t!  It said only that he was a man from Somalia. Well, that&rsquo;s bad enough. I wonder if the paper is now legally liable for inciting ethnic &#8220;hatred&#8221;? Next thing, they will be in court while this cruelly maligned man is set free. They may be paying damages to HIM! That&rsquo;s Scandinavia for you.  I did see their notice that the English-language news service is soon going to be ending.  For financial reasons, they say (although the Norwegian economy is extremely strong).</p>
<p>As for the Somali, what can you expect from a poor Moslem subjected to so much stress, stranded in a strange land, surrounded by all these wicked infidels and shameless white whores? It would drive any virtuous person berserk! I trust the Norwegian authorities will be understanding.</p>

		<p>Those Norwegians and their xenophobic racial intolerance!  Tsk, tsk!  How dare they fail to embrace the one-world tribal experience?</p>
<p>In all likelihood, the noble Somali was just misunderstood.  By the standards of his culture, cutting someone up with a knife is probably a good thing.  Those Norwegians were criminal not to appreciate it.  After all, how many of his sisters did the Somali witness having their &#8216;special day&rsquo;, then the old woman came to his village to give the girls of a certain age their &#8216;rite of passage&rsquo; treatment?</p>
<p>Just google &#8216;FGM&rsquo;.  And remember, Somalis living outside their tropical paradise of a country often thoughtfully send their daughters back home, so the girls won&rsquo;t miss out on all the fun! Norway stands to gain SOOO much from these noble people.  It&rsquo;s the Norwegians&rsquo; job to pray to the United Nations many thanks for taking away their vitamin supplements (codex) and giving them Somalis in return.</p>

		<p>Enjoying the diversity, Norwegians?  And to think, your ancestors terrified Europe.  The only thing terrifying about Norway these days is your insane political system.  Since most productive, common sense Norwegians left the country long ago, I can&rsquo;t really say I care much what happens to your make-believe socialist paradise.  Enjoy the slide into multicultural chaos.  And please don&rsquo;t bother to send post-cards.</p>

		<p>When some Norwegians learn about black on white crime in a nearby area their idea is to relocate away from the crime to a safer area and not face that the crimes are based on race or a scheme of racial displacment which must be confronted.<br>
Norwegians must come to terms with the fact that white flight is a crime within itself and when it comes to the tradition of the soil race matters.</p>

		<p>People in Scandinavia have been very naive when it comes to Blacks. Naturally, having had no experience with them, most Scandinavians  have thought Blacks were all just good, wonderful people, just like them except darker. Any problems Blacks caused or had, say in the USA, was simply  due to &#8220;white racism&#8221; in America. Of course, these clueless europeans fancied themselves different, they were so very liberal and so very tolerant, that the Blacks in their countries, would cause no problems whatsoever. The problem with Blacks in the USA was never &#8220;white racism&#8221;, it was simply Blacks being Blacks. A lesson people in Norway and the surrounding countires are going to find out the HARD way. </p>

		<p>  Knife crime is a serious problem in Norway. I wonder what size was his blade? If he had been restricted to a one inch knife, this tragedy/misunderstanding would never have happened. What do you AR posters say: it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if there were no Somalia immigrants in Norway? Why that would be racism. </p>

Gee, are you sure you were writing this about Norwegians?  For a moment, I thought it was, uh&hellip;..  <br>
Oh, well.   It couldn&rsquo;t be us. We Americans already know better, don&rsquo;t we?</p>

Of course!  The only experiences they had with them (until recently) were through American movies and television (British  too).   Thus,  understanding this fact, the present situation is not at all difficult to comprehend.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Cognitive Dissonance!</p>
<p>[I wonder if Hollywood TV and movie studios could be held liable and prosecuted for Incitement to Crime.  And also racial slander (of whites).   Intriguing thought!]</p>
