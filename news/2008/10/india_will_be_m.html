						<p>A stronger relationship with India and a close strategic partnership will be a &#8220;top priority&#8221; of a Barack Obama administration, says the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US should be working with India on a range of critical issues from preventing terrorism to promoting peace and stability in Asia,&#8221; Senator Obama said in an exclusive interview with IANS, the first with a South Asian journalist after his nomination for the presidency by the Democratic party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe Biden and I will make building a stronger relationship, including a close strategic partnership, with India a top priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>On his agenda for working with New Delhi, he said: &#8220;I also believe India is a natural strategic partner for America in the 21st century and that the US should be working with India on a range of critical issues from preventing terrorism to promoting peace and stability in Asia.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the interview, Obama elaborated on a wide range of issues, from comprehensive immigration reforms and making globalisation and trade work for American workers, to seeking the active participation of the Indian American community in the process of change that he has advocated.</p>
<p>He said he would support &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221;, including the H-1B visa programme &#8220;to attract some of the world most talented people to America&#8221;.</p>
<p>Obama explained that he wanted to end abuses of the H1-B visas that is used by highly qualified specialists to work in US. He added that he would make &#8220;immigrant workers less dependent on their employers for their right to stay in the country, and would hold accountable employers who abuse the system and their workers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Obama administration, he said, would seek to strengthen ties with the &#8220;vibrant&#8221; Indian American community and encourage their &#8220;active engagement .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in making the change we seek&#8221;.</p>
<p>He asserted the Democratic nomination was running on the manifesto of &#8220;inclusiveness, optimism and hope&#8221; that will translate into a &#8220;progressive presidency&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the contentious election topics of outsourcing and globalisation, he said: &#8220;We know that we cannot and should not put up walls around our economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acknowledging that global competition &#8220;is a fact that cannot be reversed&#8221;, Obama added: &#8220;But we must find a way to make globalisation and trade work for American workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama has deep roots in Chicago, having started his career as a community organiser in the city. From his days as an Illinois senator, he has had strong links with the city&rsquo;s growing Indian American community. He has worked regularly on issues ranging from reforms in immigration and campaign finance, to health care and education, with Illinois&rsquo; premier Indian political networking group, the Indo-American Democratic Organization.</p>
<p>Excerpts from the interview with IANS:</p>
<p>Q: Immigrants have, over the years, made a critical contribution to the United States. But now the US stands to lose its leadership in the sciences, in part because of restrictive immigration policies. Do you plan to reform immigration laws so that the US is once again a magnet for talent from around the world?</p>
<p>A: I have played a leading role in crafting comprehensive immigration reform and believe that our broken immigration system can only be fixed by putting politics aside and offering a solution that strengthens our security while reaffirming our heritage as a nation of immigrants. I believe we must secure our borders, fix our broken immigration bureaucracy, and require the 12 million undocumented to get on a responsible path to citizenship. They must pay a fine, learn English, and go to the back of the line for citizenship. I will also increase the number of people we allow in the country legally to a level that unites families and meets the demand for jobs employers cannot fill.</p>
<p>Q: Many economists have asserted that in an increasingly globalised world, it is counter productive to restrict the flow of capital, labour and increasingly jobs. Do you plan to restrict outsourcing, or would you prefer that American companies respond to this threat by moving up the value chain instead?</p>
<p>A: Revolutions in communications and technology have sent jobs wherever there&rsquo;s an internet connection, and have forced workers in Chicago and Boston to compete for those jobs with workers in Bangalore and Beijing. We live in a more competitive world, and that is a fact that cannot be reversed. We know that we cannot and should not put up walls around our economy. But we must find a way to make globalisation and trade work for American workers.</p>
<p>The American worker needs to be supported and given the tools needed to compete in the global economy. So I would pursue common-sense measures such as offering tax incentives to companies that create jobs in the United States, undertaking policies, such as supporting growth sectors like renewable energy and building up our infrastructure, that will lead to creation of well-paying jobs, and, most importantly, investing in education and job re-training programmes. The United States has faced fundamental economic challenges before and it has met them by expanding opportunity outward, growing our middle class, and investing in the education and well-being of our workers.</p>
<p>Q: Are you worried about the fragile polity in Pakistan coupled with the looming presence of terror networks? Would you continue to consider Pakistan as a trusted ally?</p>
<p>A: I want to build a broad-based and lasting relationship with the people of Pakistan &mdash; not just temporary alliances with their government. While the US and Pakistan must continue to work together to combat terrorism that has claimed innocent lives in both countries and to destroy the terrorist sanctuaries along the Afghan-Pakistani border, I will make helping Pakistan tackle critical challenges like illiteracy, poverty, and lack of health care a key priority including by increasing aid in these areas. I will stand up for democratic institutions, civil society and judicial independence in Pakistan. I cosponsored legislation with Senator Lugar to triple non-military assistance to Pakistan and sustain it for the next decade.</p>
<p>Q: What are your views on the demand made by several US companies including Microsoft that the US needs to increase the number of work visas (H1B) to protect its technological leadership?</p>
<p>A: I support comprehensive immigration reform that includes improving our visa programmes, including the H-1B programme, to attract some of the world&rsquo;s most talented people to America. I would like to see immigrant workers less dependent on their employers for their right to stay in the country, and would hold accountable employers who abuse the system and their workers.</p>
<p>Q: From an outsider&rsquo;s perspective questions such as whether America is &#8220;ready for a black president&#8221; sounds almost medieval. Why do you think a democracy which is 232 years old is still grappling with such issues?</p>
<p>A: Just 50 years ago, nine brave African American schoolchildren sought to realise the promise of Brown v. Board of Education by walking past an angry mob and into the doors of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. The event marked a great moment in America &lsquo;s long march toward equality and freedom. The federal government put itself firmly on the side of justice and equal opportunity for all. And this was only the beginning. That same month, the Civil Rights Act of 1957 was signed into law, and the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division was created shortly thereafter. In the years that followed, another Civil Rights Act and a Voting Rights Act were passed. These laws, and the institutional practices they created, helped transform our nation into one that is more just, more equal, and more free.</p>
<p>While we have made significant progress over the last five decades, there is no question that we have more work to do. Joe Biden and I will build upon our nation&rsquo;s commitment to equal justice and opportunity for all. We will restore professionalism to the Civil Rights Division and reinvigorate federal civil rights enforcement and reform our criminal justice system so that it works for all, regardless of race, wealth, or other circumstances. We are running on inclusiveness, optimism and hope, and that will translate into a progressive presidency on issues of diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Q: You have voted for the Indo-US nuclear deal. Would you consider India a strategic partner with the United States in its efforts to promote stability in the Asian region?</p>
<p>A: I am an advocate of strengthening US relations with India, the world&rsquo;s largest democracy and a growing economic power. I voted for the India civilian nuclear cooperation deal in 2006 and have since worked to ensure that the agreement is implemented properly so that Indians benefit from expanded energy sources and that nuclear proliferation concerns are addressed. I also believe that India is a natural strategic partner for America in the 21st century and that the US should be working with India on a range of critical issues from preventing terrorism to promoting peace and stability in Asia. Joe Biden and I will make building a stronger relationship, including a close strategic partnership, with India a top priority.</p>
<p>Q: Indian Americans, like many others, look upon you as an agent of change. What would you like to say to them?</p>
<p>A: As a community organiser, civil rights lawyer, and elected official, I have spent my career working on issues of importance to Indian Americans. I am proud to have worked side-by-side with Indian Americans on a variety of issues, including immigration, civil rights, foreign policy, and education, and Joe Biden and I look forward to strengthening our relationships with Indian Americans during my administration. We will reach out to encourage the active engagement of the vibrant Indian American community in making the change we seek.<br>

			<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s TV ads always talk about how he wants to keep jobs in America.  Now we know the catch:  They&rsquo;ll be done literally in America, but an H1B visa holder will be doing the job, not you.</p>
<p>Frankly, if your only solution to job losses is to reversing tax breaks for companies that move the jobs, then you ought to hang it up.  Companies that move jobs don&rsquo;t do for any other reason but the labor is cheaper.  Tiny tax hikes won&rsquo;t make it any better.  The labor is that much cheaper.</p>

<p>Actually, he&rsquo;s not fooling anybody.  What he wants to do is conmtinue to flood the country with non-whites, because he perceives the continued inundation will decrease white power and further multculturalize society, which he perceives is beneficial to blacks.</p>
<p>Remember:  Every single thing he proposes is designed to assist blacks some way, so every time he announces a policy, sit back and analyze how he perceives black benefit from it, and you will know why he favors what he does and proposes.<br>

I think that some of this &rsquo; Talent&rsquo; crashed one of our Mars missions.</p>

			<p>I was nodding in agreement up until he had to mention &#8220;immigration reform&#8221;.   Indians usually perform well in the United States, but one only has to pick up an issue of National Geographic and thumb through the pictures of India&rsquo;s inner cities to know what&rsquo;s in store should Obama decide to open the floodgates.  </p>

			<p>THE TURTH OF THE MATTER</p>
<p>East Indians are full of African blood.  The Human Genome Project proves it.  So it is natural that Obama will prefer them.   Even in the North India, only a few drops of Aryan blood remain.  Miscegenation destroyed that gene pool. </p>

			<p>More H1-B visas will make all of the junky electronic gadgets that we are up to our ears in just a little bit cheaper,as if we really need them, and it will put a lot of highly skilled Americans out of work, while enriching the heads of a few corporations.Whup-tee-doo!</p>

			<p>This is just more proof that NWO advocates like Obama are intentionally eviscerating our economy by outsourcing any worthwhile job overseas, using &#8216;free trade&rsquo;, NAFTA, GATT, and the coming-soon North American Union.  All of these trade mechanisms are merely smoke screens for the destruction of our soverignty.  </p>
<p>England&rsquo;s already on board with outsourcing to India  &mdash;  when you call the equivalent of 911 emergency, you get to talk to an operator in India who will pass your concerns back to the police in your jurisdiction.  This is the shape of things to come, to quote H.G. Wells in his prophetic book on how the world is being planned for us all.<br>

			<p>Obama and his socialist handlers would enthusiastically agree with the future that Leon Trotsky planned out for all of us almost a hundred years ago:</p>
<p>&#8221; - We should turn Her (Russia) into a desert populated with white &#8216;N***ers&rsquo;.   We will impose upon them such a tyranny that was never dreamt by the most hideous despots of the East.  The peculiar trait of that tyranny is that it will be enacted from the Left rather than the Right, and it will be red rather than white in color.  Its color will be red literally because we would spill such torrents of blood that will pale all human losses of the capitalist wars and make (the survivors) shudder. </p>
<p>The largest overseas banks will cooperate with us most closely.  If we win the Revolution and squash Russia, on the funeral pyres of its remains we will&hellip;.become a power the whole world would drop in the face of on its knees.  We will show (to the world) what the real power means.  By way of terror and blood baths we will bring Russian intelligentsia into the state of total stupor, to idiocy, to the animal state of being&hellip;</p>
<p>And so far our young men dressed in leather&hellip;.oh, how beautifully, how brilliantly do they master hatred of everything Russian!   With what a great delight do they physically destroy Russian intelligentsia - officers, engineers, teachers, priests, generals, agronomists, academicians, writers!&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Leon Trotsky, quoted in &#8220;Secret Forces in History of Russia,&#8221; U.K. Begunov 1995, p 148.  Source: Simanovich, Aaron Samuilovich, &#8220;Recollections of the Secretary of Grigoriy Rasputin.&#8221;  Paris, 1922. </p>

<p>Nonsense. Carefully selected immigration, from Europe, has helped America. We have  plenty of immigrants from Asia, we don&rsquo;t need anymore.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Barack Obama&rsquo;s TV ads always talk about how he wants to keep jobs in America. Now we know the catch: They&rsquo;ll be done literally in America, but an H1B visa holder will be doing the job, not you.&#8221;</p>
<p>That goes without saying &#8216;Question Diversity&rsquo;, as a matter of fact it&rsquo;s going on right now, especially in the IT field.  Companies are hiring all Indians and Orientals - right here in the U.S. now and they&rsquo;re working for less.  They&rsquo;re hired because the companies KNOW these people WILL work for less.  Obama&rsquo;s talking about &#8216;outsourcing and competition&rsquo;; this outsourcing has nothing to do with getting the best people, but has all to do with paying lower salaries and marginalizing the White male, which is going on especially in the computer industry.  In the future it will also gravitate to other fields as well if left to its own devices, because when these non-Whites get positions of power they will only hire others of their &#8216;group&rsquo; and will actively engage in discrimination against European-Americans.  When we become a minority in the land our forefathers built and tamed the term &#8216;minority&rsquo; will be taking on a new meaning.  The definition will be then changed purposefully to exclude Whites.  The longer we wait to act the harder it will be for us.</p>

If these Indians were as good as they&rsquo;re claimed to be, you&rsquo;d think India would be fighting tooth and nail to keep them. Funny how India is happy to work with the US to export their best and brightest.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of things wrong with this statement, and you don&rsquo;t have to look hard to see them.  The arrogance of Indians disgusts me.  </p>
<p>There are a lot of people on here who think it may be a good thing for Obama to win so that our people can wake up.  I don&rsquo;t think the people who feel this way realize what a terrifying nightmare for white people this county can become over the four years this man becomes elected. </p>
<p>I realize that McCain isn&rsquo;t all that great, but not voting for him will only put the other one in office.  If you think a third party is going to win, forget it.  Just remember that at least McCain won&rsquo;t try to take your guns away when you need them most.  And he may be a neocon but he sure isn&rsquo;t a socialist with a freakishly cryptic agenda.</p>
<p>In any case, I think McCain will be enough to rejuvenate a healthy conservative movement as a backlash.  But putting Obama in office just to teach Republicans a lesson is flat out suicidal and dangerous.</p>

			<p>Why is India so interested in getting its people into the United States? Why don&rsquo;t they want to keep their &#8220;best and brightest?&#8221; The fact is that they understand that these emigrants will be Indians, first, last and always, and will exercise political and economic influence on behalf of India.</p>
<p>B. Hussein Obama&rsquo;s television ads bemoan the loss of American jobs overseas. Apparently he&rsquo;s not troubled by the prospect of Americans losing their jobs here to coolie scabs.</p>

			<p>&#8221; From an outsider&rsquo;s perspective questions such as whether America is &ldquo;ready for a black president&rdquo; sounds almost medieval. Why do you think a democracy which is 232 years old is still grappling with such issues?&#8221; coming out of the mouth of south asian journalist.Does it sound medieval in comparison to your highly civilized culture of south asia?!</p>

			<p>I continue to see comments such as that from &#8220;Awakened&#8221; @ 10:09 writing about &#8220;acting&#8221;, etc. as in &#8220;The longer we wait to ACT the harder it will be for us.&#8221;  What are we Whites supposed to DO? I write letters, speak out in certain forums, etc, but nothing changes. The powers that oppose us are so well funded and so powerful that I despair of anything short of some kind of natural cataclysm changing anything. Look at what happened in Rhodesia and South Africa. Look at the pitiful White &#8220;resistance&#8221; that was mounted in those places. Probably the same thing will happen in the US because if any natural leader dares to rise up, he/she will meet the same fate that Haider of Austria met recently. No cohesive resistance will be allowed to form. If this sounds like a dark outlook (no pun intended), it is. But I fear it is an accurate assessment.</p>

			<p>Hindus-Sikhs should never have been allowed into America.  The reason why there are over two million hindus-sikhs  in America today is because there was a prexisting population that was allowed in in the sixties and seventies.</p>
<p>The hindus and other post-1965 asian groups are actively involved in the deskilling of the Euro-Amreian population,and this Ladies and Gentlemen is incipient genocide.</p>
<p>When was the last time Steve Sailer wrote anything critical of hindu LEGAL immigration. All we get from Sailer is boring pop sociology.</p>
<p>In a public debate, if you make the case against immigration based upon racial differences in IQ, with 100 percent certainty, the debate will be completetly sidetracked by a boring discussion about psychometrics. As a consequence, the extremely harmfull consequences of asian LEGAL immigration for Native Born White Americans will never be discussed.</p>
<p>If you really want to blow the national debate about immigration wide open,start focusing on LEGAL asian immgration.</p>

<p>East Indians are full of African blood. The Human Genome Project proves it. So it is natural that Obama will prefer them. Even in the North India, only a few drops of Aryan blood remain. Miscegenation destroyed that gene pool. </p>

<p>This is nonsense and highly illogical. Your argument that Indians are Africans is an Afrocentrist argument. Nowhere does the article you posted mention that Indians are Africans or have African blood. The population of India is 75% Aryan and the remainder are Dravidians who live in South India and also the lower castes in North India. They are not Africans and have no African blood.</p>
<p>You need to source and reference properly. The people on thos forum are thinkers. We dont swallow Afrocentrist nonsense here. The same types that talk of Indians being Africans also talk of Chinese civilisation being African origin, Romans being blacks, Greeks being blacks and Egyptians being blacks etc etc </p>
<p>If you think Indians and blacks are so &#8216;friendly&rsquo; then I have one name for you: Republican Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing your anger on Indians, focus it on the millions of treacherous whites who have given Obama a massive 10 point poll lead.</p>
<p>I rest my case.</p>

			<p>Lets just imagine Obama&rsquo;s own position within the Indian caste system. He can&rsquo;t be a Brahmin (the highest) as he is not born a brahmin and they act as middle men between gods and men. They spend their lives in pursuit of divine knowledge and preservation of traditions. So Obama certainly won&rsquo;t qualify. Could he be a warrior of the Kshatriayas who bestow gifts to brahmins and sacrifice to gods and ancestors? Once again, he does not qualify, no matter what he says. How about him being a merchant or peasant? These vrishyas tend cattle, offer sacrifices, lend money and cultivate land. The &#8216;lending of money&rsquo; bit may raise a few eyebrows but I feel that this idea has just fallen into utter disrepute! Pity the poor chandalas who are the lowest and considered impure. Even their own shadows are said to cast evil, therefore they are not permitted to walk around during daytime and emerge at night to collect human waste. Well, someone has to do it. This is all a very simplified description of the caste system which has many sub-divisions and based around social dictats and assigned work tasks. There is one group who live apart and raise their daughters to be prostitutes for the gratification of higher castes. Once very young girls have developed nicely, they are put up for auction. Their virginity goes to the highest bidder and the money raised provides funds for a huge feast catering to the whole village. The girl is then available at a discount to spend the rest of her life selling her flesh and raising more little girls. What joy. The entire caste system is based on skin colour and facial features and marriage &#8216;out-of-caste&rsquo; is normally totally forbidden to avoid &#8216;inter-mixture&rsquo;. How Obama considers all this in relation to &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; and racism is a little clouded. Perhaps he can persuade call centres to segregate work stations once his immigration policies have brought in lots of indians, after all, if muslims are entitled to prayer breaks, their own canteens, foot baths and time off for ramadan, what is to stop the caste system from being demanded. Lets not forget that India firmly condemned South Africa during the apartheid era as the thousands of hindu families were not classed quite as high as Whites, although they did not object being listed higher than blacks. As I opened this comment, so I close it. Lets just imagine Obama&rsquo;s own position within the Indian caste system.</p>

<p>I sympathize with your despair.  Sometimes I wonder myself what there is left to do.  But pessimism of the nature that is presented in your post doesn&rsquo;t do us any good. I see posts like yours all the time on here.  </p>
<p>What is the point in even having this website if &#8220;there is nothing we can do and that is that, end of story&#8221;?????   What is Jared Taylor sacrificing for by showing his face on television if most white people in this movement feel the way you do?</p>
<p>It is absurd and defeatist to claim that &#8220;it is over for us&#8221;.  Look at Europe.  The right wing parties continue to gain ground. People are waking up.  Over here we don&rsquo;t have a multiple party system but we have the internet.  </p>
<p>There are all sorts of websites other than Amren that support our cause, and the leaders of those websites are constantly reporting on how the traffic they are receiving is higher than ever.  Jared Taylor constantly tells us the same about Amren. </p>
<p>Our people are too great of a people to let something like this happen to them.  Do you really believe whites are that ignorant to stand aside and allow for the complete wipe out of their own people and civilization?  I expect better from our people and it discourages me that so many in this movement hold our people to such a low standard in this regard.</p>

			<p>Bush may be the last White President. Think about the magic time when Whites become 50% of the people that vote for President. If it won&rsquo;t be by 2016, it will be soon after. I choose the 50% threshold because it makes for easy arithmetic.</p>
<p>If non-whites vote 60% to 40% for the non-white candidate, Whites would need to vote 60% to 40% for the White candidate to break even; if non-whites voted 75% to 25% for the non-white candidate, Whites would have to vote 75% to 25% for the White candidate to break even, and so on. Am I just making a simple-minded obvious calculation? Yes, simple to understand and obvious, and terrible in it&rsquo;s implications!</p>
<p>The last couple of decades have shown that race trumps class. The elite likes that; it means races are busy fighting one another, instead of focusing on them. But if the walls of Constantinople couldn&rsquo;d withstand the siege of the Turks in 1453, the gated communities of the elites won&rsquo;t keep out the dark hordes in our time. They&rsquo;ll get what they deserve.</p>
<p>The latest financial crisis shows what a delicate equilibrium our economy is, and once thrown off balance, how hard it is to stop it&rsquo;s downward slide. Does anyone, on this site, think that Multiculturism (with Whites marginalized) can keep up the game.</p>
<p>We all have a vision what the future will be like in the interesting times ahead. We&rsquo;ll all be wrong. Too many alternative universes that could be acted out. Much will depend on luck, but also keeping on our toes for opportunity. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if our future descendents said of us: &#8220;Yes, they made some mistakes, but in the end they didn&rsquo;t let us down.&#8221;</p>

			<p>How about solving the &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; by hiring the white American men who graduated in science and engineering but found the employers wanted only cheaper asians and indians? </p>

<p> Sure corporations are looking overseas for cheap labor- though I don&rsquo;t agree with it, the pool of possible candidates for many of these positions is limited.  These are positions which require higher IQ and the ability to utilize critical thinking.  This throws out many of the current &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; graduates of our colleges and universities.  The remaining pool of candidates must be willing to roll up their sleeves and work to achieve success. <br>
 <br>
  Many of the current graduates (gen y&rsquo;ers or &#8220;millenials&#8221;) walk into an interview with expectations to have generous salaries, the best assignments,  the &#8220;window&#8221; office, and of course, no overtime   This is the result of being raised by parents who believe &#8220;everyone is a winner&#8221;, (therefore there is no need to keep score) and &#8220;my kid was child of the week blah, blah, blah&#8221; of course this was just because they showed up for school- after all this is all the school required of them!</p>
<p>Many of these new grads have been coddled their entire lives and have developed such a sense of entitlement that they refuse to put in the necessary effort to work their way up in an organization.  It is nice to think you can &#8220;write your own ticket&#8221; once you graduate, but whatever happened to hard work and earning promotions? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad the current college grads do not have the work ethic of 50+ years ago, but then again, why should they?  After all, the entitlement mantra has been shoved down their throats by liberalnazis since they were born.  As a nation, I fear we have reaped what we sowed.</p>

			<p>I had to look up  Philip the Arab [formerly known as &#8220;the Arabian&#8221;, but that wasn&rsquo;t his real name anyway].  It was common in Rome to attach fanciful nicknames such as Germanicus, Britanicus, Scipio Africanus   &mdash;   but that didn&rsquo;t mean they were German, British, or African!   Philip was born near Damascus in the Roman province of Syria, and ruled for five years, one of a long line of constantly changing emperors. His father was a prominent Roman citizen. (He was said by some historians to have been the first Christian emperor, rather than Constantine.)</p>

			<p>Just one thing about the Obamas that has infuriated me from the beginning is their talk of making college affordable to everyone. Just because they&rsquo;re black, &#8216;educated&rsquo;, or the first in their families to go to college; this does not mean that everyone was meant to go to college. Even if everyone could finance college, a person has to have made a conscious effort for discipline and academic success early on to plan for wanting to go to college. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of making it affordable to everyone through socialist means if our President is working FOR we Americans &#8220;to attract some of the world&rsquo;s most talented people TO America&#8221;?</p>
<p>NO OBAMA. KEEP THE CHANGE.</p>

<p>No mystery there.  It&rsquo;s not just the Obamas, it&rsquo;s most Dems.  What they mean by &#8220;making college more affordable&#8221; is increasing grants, and reducing student loan interest rates.  When that happens, colleges and universities can raise tuition rates, thereby making college less affordable.  Then you need more grants and lower student loan interest rates, and then colleges and universities can raise tutition rates, thereby making college less affordable&hellip;you get the drift.</p>
<p>Academia is essentially an arm of the Democrat Party.  This is how Democrat politicians reward them, by engineering these policies to pump more money through the veins of academia.</p>

			<p>No one seems to have picked up the fact that the Indians in Chicago that Obama has associated with in the past are exclusively Muslims. There might well be enough Indians in Dearborn to call it the Mecca of North America, but these are the Indians that India does not even want.When, after independence, India separated into<br>
Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India - at the Muslims insistence - the very Muslims who advocated this stayed behind in India. In the typical Muslim fashion, the Hindus who stayed in Pakistan and Kashmir have been hounded and most of them driven out, while the Muslims keep infiltrating India, there are now as many Muslims in India as there are in Pakistan. Sounds unbelievable, but it is a fact. </p>

<p>I agree with some of what you say but only some of it.  Yes, the Chinese, Egyptians, and Indians created decent civilizations, but they don&rsquo;t in any way compare to those of the white man.  There are other people in this world, other than blacks, who are below whites on a civilizational scale.  Indians don&rsquo;t need to be in white societies any more than Africans do.</p>
<p>And the polls are inaccurate.  It is really only a minority of whites who like Obama.  </p>

<p>Your post is a little insulting.  Are you saying the people from these third world dumps have higher IQs than the &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; white people in this country?  And how are their universities better than ours?  I have yet to see India&rsquo;s universities make it in the top 50 ranked world wide universities.  The top 20 to 30 are usually European or American.  And when you are talking about our universities being &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; you can&rsquo;t compare us to countries like India.  You have to compare us to Europe and Japan, because those are the only areas that are better off than us.  There are articles all over the internet on how affirmative action dominates in India.  It dominates in every third world brown/black skinned society.</p>

<p>Absolutely true.  Moslem clerics in India  (despite its massive overpopulation!) urge their fellow Moslems to have as many children as possible. Meanwhile, Hindus are encouraged (by the government) to practice birth control, which is anathema to Moslems.  A demographic war is going on there, even if only one side seems to be aware of it. And that side is winning.</p>
<p>Tolerance has been a distinguishing mark of modern Western societies and it is  normally a commendable thing; but it is suicidal to be tolerant of someone else when they are not tolerant of you in return.  This is a cautionary lesson to be learned by those who are currently advocating dismantlement of the USA.  If you take such an action, you must shut your borders and your institutions resolutely - or at least on a reciprocal arrangement. If you allow some [of the &#8220;other&#8221; group] to enter or to remain - whether out of mistaken humanitarianism or compassion - within a few generations they will have outbred you  (as is happening in India within the past half century) and you&rsquo;ll be right back in the same predicament where you were.</p>
<p>There are numerous examples in the world of a rival population outbreeding another. Hungary, which was a much larger country in the Middle Ages, allowed Romanian  &#8220;immigrants&#8221; to trickle in. Once there, the Romanians simply outbred them,  and in time a good part of what was once Hungary became what is now Romania.  And we have just witnessed the more fertile Albanians take over and replace the Serbs in what was considered the Serb&rsquo;s historic heartland, Kosovo. About a century ago, the Netherlands was a predominantly Protestant country; but the Dutch Catholics (indigenous) had a higher birth rate and became the majority.  Now of course, Catholics and Protestants are being outbred by newly arrived Moslems who, if nothing changes, will soon replace them both.</p>
<p>And, needless to say, we are seeing the same things taking place here in America, beneath our eyes.  Tolerance, like  charity and altruism, is laudable when practiced among one&rsquo;s own. But there are limits. I do not advocate standing by and politely &#8220;tolerating&#8221; one&rsquo;s own demise and replacement by others. Nonetheless, this will inevitably happen to any population that is passive enough or foolish enough to allow it.</p>

<p>Our universities pump out radical Leftie students with degrees in Arabian mattreses, totally unemployable but since they live breed and breathe on benefit payments they dont care.</p>
<p>Our borders are breached on a daily basis, we build mosques madrasses and cater to every minority. They keep white people down by calling them &#8220;Racists&#8221; if they complain about second class treatment. Plans are afoot to dig up war graves and build a mosque on the land. Sharia Law has been welcomed by politicians and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Hatred and mistrust has been seething from the people for a long time.</p>
<p>The one Nationalist party the BNP is demonised, reviled and banned to academics, such  is the Socialist stranglehold from the Trade Unions (who support the violent Leftists who attack members of the BNP.)<br>
But something strange is happening, the little guy is waking up and he&rsquo;s angry.<br>
He&rsquo;s voting for the BNP and outwardly supporting them. A BNP candidate won a seat in the London Mayoral Elections this year. This is  unprecedented.</p>
<p>Across Europe, in Australia in NZ, a New Right is rising.<br>
Never forget where you came from, the brave white races who set off across oceans and built nations and put down roots.<br>
While you still have a vote, use it, send all info on Obama to everyone in your address book and beyond, show them the meaning of viral marketing.<br>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s not enough that the US has allowed so many Indian doctors to practice here at the expense of our own citizens who have spent so much money and time graduating from med school.  They tend to treat whites with a mixture of disdain and arrogance.  I really feel for the young med students in our universities who will be forced to compete even further with Indian doctors who have no logical reason to be practicing here anyway.</p>

			<p>I heard Obama say that he will &#8220;build the middle class.&#8221;  He didn&rsquo;t say rebuild, he didn&rsquo;t say support, he said &#8220;build.&#8221;  I think that this is a telling detail.  I have thought all along that he intends to replace the White majority middle class with &#8220;minorities&#8221; through the continuation and expansion of Affirmative Action type programs.  This article seems to heavily reenforce this notion.</p>
<p>Anyone notice all the mulatto newsmen appearing on CNN and other places lately?  I even saw one take advantage of a moment to hold hands with his White female newscaster.  The media keeps bludgeoning the public with Black males and White women in pairs or as consequetive sets.  This has gone on a long time, but it is so loud and constant now that I cannot believe that everyone isn&rsquo;t noticing it.  The message seems pretty clear to me, and if this isn&rsquo;t a conspiracy, like the cyber conspiracy to promote Obama&rsquo;s campaign, then there is no such thing as a conspriacy.  On NPR this morning, a show was going from one example to another of a White Democrat, mostly in Pennsylvania that would not vote for Obama.  They were pounding on the White racist reasons for Whites not voting for him.  I would really like to see or hear a program where Blacks are interviewed and led to admit that they are voting for Obama because he is &#8220;Black.&#8221;  It is all blantantly racial.  All of this pretense that it has gone beyond race is an incredibly transparent lie that no one seems to be able to touch, or is being ignored because it is part of the loose conspiracy to ignore the blantan hypocrisy of Obama&rsquo;s campaign marketer&rsquo;s continual use of the accusation of racism in their opponents.</p>
<p>And these conspirators are funding Obama in an unpredidented fashion - surely the biggest marketing campaign in history.  Just check out the following;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one of the top 25 donors to political 527 groups has given to a conservative organization, shedding further light on the huge disparity between Democrats and Republicans in this new fund-raising area.</p>
<p>&#8220;The top three 527 donors so far in the 2004 election cycle - Hollywood producer Steven Bing, Progressive Corp. chairman Peter Lewis and financier George Soros - have combined to give nearly $24 million to prominent liberal groups. They include Joint Victory Campaign 2004, America Coming Together and MoveOn.org. </p>
<p> According to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks 527 data, liberal organizations have amassed nearly $80 million in donations compared to a mere $8 million for their conservative counterparts. Groups are categorized as 527s for the section of tax code that regulates them.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sample from a CNSN News article.</p>
<p>This was speaking of the 2004 campaign.  Can you imagine what the ratio is like now.  And it is so secretive.  George Soros is keeping very quiet this time, and so are the other big money donors.</p>

			<p>GHW - Philip the Arab was really Caucasian and really of Arab origin. There is no contradiction. Arabs that are not Caucasians are descendents (at least in part) of black slaves. But, 2000 years ago, black slaves are very rare(they are common only in American movies). Semites are simply dark Caucasians (Saddam was a good exemple). Also Septimio Severo born in Lybia from a Italian-Berber family. Blacks(or mixed) are common only in Egipt,but even there, the majority was Caucasian (there is no Black Civilization).<br>
Blacks in India? Sure, You know, even the Vickings&hellip; </p>

			<p>      Anytime you hear the word &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; be on guard: know<br>
that a legal crime is about to be perpetrated. This is the way<br>
a country crumbles-betrayed from within. Study economic history.<br>
Vigorous and sustained use of the tariff is one of the secrets<br>
to national prosperity. A prosperous nation cannot compete with<br>
slave or coolie labor-except by becoming the same. This is Barack&rsquo;s great ideal: a nation of White Peasants. The big pic-<br>
ture? H.G. Wells said, &#8220;Countless people will hate the New World<br>
Order and die fighting it&#8221;. He was with them but partially de-<br>
fected. He hated their brutality and wanted the nations to join<br>
it voluntarily. Well, he wanted what can never be. We will never<br>
assent to this outrage, brutality or not. There are worse things<br>
than war or death-such as what Barack and Co have planned for us.</p>

Miscegenation has destroyed N. India. Let India be a lesson what miscegenation could do to the West. </p>

<p>Uh sorry, but that charactor is no scholar, but a dyed in the wool afrocentrist.</p>
<p>He not only believes India was origianlly inhabited by Africans</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8j4ozFf1R4" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8j4ozFf1R4</a>  </p>

<p>He also contends that Russia was once ruled by African aristocrats.</p>
<p>And of course he also believes Africans arrived in the Americas before Columbus.</p>
<p>Have to say though, I bet Obama would consider him a scholar.</p>

			<p>Regardless of how thoughtful he plans to be in the area of foriegn policy, he will ruin America with his Robin Hood polices, robbing not just from the rich, and giving to the poor, but also from the middle-class&hellip;In other words taking from White America and giving even more to blacks. And we all know how that worked out for the economy with subprime loans. Now there will just be much more of the same. Our country is facing a major depression if this clown takes office.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&rdquo; From an outsider&rsquo;s perspective questions such as whether America is &ldquo;ready for a black president&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Is India ready for a Dalit (untouchable) president? Do Brahmin&rsquo;s and Dalit&rsquo;s marry without opposistion from family and happily raise their mixed caste children as whites and blacks do in the United States? Do young Brahmins flock to Dalit dance clubs?  Do they enjoy Dalit music?</p>
<p>How many Dalits are movie stars such as Will Smith, Morgan Freeman etc?  How many Indian actors, dancers and musicians slather themselves with skin bleaching creme, dye their hair dark brown and wear hazel green contact lenses?</p>
<p><br>
And how many of India&rsquo;s major cities have Dalit mayors?  How many Indian states have Dalit governors and congress critters.  How many of India&rsquo;s great cities have city councils that are more than half Dalit?</p>
<p>Answer thoee questions Mr. S. Indian journalist before you make your condescending remarks about America&rsquo;s racial relations.</p>

			<p>More plans for the Obama dictatorship</p>
<p>According to Chicago Sun-Times columnist Michael Sneed, Barack Obama, the so called first post racial presidential candidate, has indicated that he wants his US Senate vacancy filled by a black if he is elected president. Jesse Jackson, Jr., wants the US Senate seat and hopes to have his wife appointed to his current seat in the US House of Representatives. </p>
<p>Governor Rod Blagojevich would have the power to fill the vacancies, but may or may not go along with the wishes of his former pal Barack Obama. Blagojevich and Obama were both tight with Tony Rezko and Blagojevich is in hot water with the Federal prosecutors right now. <br>

<p>Again look at the <b>source<b> of your material. You quote a radical black American Afro-centrist militant named &#8216;Runoko Rashidi&rsquo; whose academic focus is in &#8220;the Black foundations of world civilizations&#8221;.  </b></b></p>
<p>Examples of his outrageous claims can be seen here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blackherbals.com/african_roots_of_humanity_and_ci.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackherbals.com/african_roots_of_humanity_and_ci.htm</a>  <br>
and here: <br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runoko_Rashidi" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runoko_Rashidi</a></p>
<p>Blacks in China<br>
Rashidi claims that the Chinese were originally black Africoid in appearance when they first arrived in China.</p>
<p>Blacks in Southeast Asia<br>
Rashidi claims the Khmer were an Africoid racial group in Southeast Asia who were renowned for their scholarly work.</p>
<p>Blacks in Egypt<br>
Rashidi claims that Egyptians have the same craniofacial measurements as people in Central Africa</p>
<p>Blacks in Europe<br>
Rashidi claims that the historical black presence includes &#8220;England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Scandinavia&#8221;. He claims that legends of &#8220;dark&#8221; people and dark/black attributes of individuals such as the Scotsman Kenneth &#8220;the Niger&#8221; and the Viking Thorhall are to be taken literally as evidence of ancient Black presence and/or admixture.</p>
<p>Japanese<br>
Rashidi claims that archaeological evidence dating back 22,000 years ago in Japan shows architectural similarity with African bushmen.</p>
<p>First Asians<br>
Rashidi claims that the first Asians were Negrito Africoid people with kinky hair, yellow to dark brown skin and short stature.[5] In his words, they were &#8220;the supreme lords of the earth&#8221; with &#8220;monumental civilizations&#8221; of advanced technology.</p>
<p>In terms of miscegenation CP you should check your own ancestry. Studies in the 1950&rsquo;s (not a decade known for liberalism or pro-black sentiment)proved that 28% of US &#8216;whites&rsquo; had some black African ancestry. My guess is that you are among that 28%.</p>
<p>Lastly you should know that North India is Indo-Aryan. South India is Dravidian.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Classical anthropology often placed South Asians and North Africans in the same taxonomic group as Europeans and designated them both as Caucasoids [THIS VIEW HAS BEEN PROVEN WRONG]. But modern genetic studies, such as those by L. L. Cavalli-Sforza, show the South Asians/North Africans are a surprisingly distinct &#8220;genetic cluster&#8221;. They can be distinguished from Europeans to their north as well as from sub-Saharan Africans to their south and the other Asian groups to their east.&#8221;</p>

			<p> Nehru it showed on the tv show 60 minutes started to put his smartest people thru colleges at taxpayer expense so they would help improve his country. (India) What happened is a lot of them immigrated to America. Plus a lot come on H1b. Lot of good that did the taxpayers of India. It was a good idea but the traitors (my opinion) left India. They did get the benefit of taxpayers of India and they should get something back. Why didn,t they do that in America? No because they want multicultural madness to be the norm. But they have AA which is backwards. Look at some of the weird ideas they have for this country. They call it an ATM(automatic teller machine) but in reality the person using it is donating their labor by punching in the information. They make people donate their labor when you pump your own gas in your car. Whats the benefit to the consumer? They now are trying to have people check themselves out at supermarkets which would amount to more donated labor as they wouldn,t have to pay a checkout girl. People seem to be resisting this one. But you watch they,ll make it into a giant vending machine so you just punch in your order and automation will fill your order and you,ll probably stay in your car and just load up and go. A lot of the factories are fully automated where you just have to load stuff in and load stuff out at the other end. This is all eliminating jobs rapidly and a lot of people have become wealthy over this. Plus add another evil is outsourcing jobs overseas. It would help if they would buy something off of us but this country doesn,t produce much but maybe food and movies. If you do have a job the crony capitalists want you to accept between 8 dollars and 12 dollars an hour and they wonder why you can,t afford to buy a 300,000 dollar house. I am of a mind that if they insist on automating everything start taxing the robots in the amount of what the taxes they got when they had people working there. Instead of a capitalist competitive society we could have a cooperative caring society where everybody would benefit from automation. But i read my bible and see what the final outcome is. with human nature doesn,t take a genius to see that would always be the outcome. maranantha One final thought they call this a consumer based economy but if all there is loss of jobs and lower paying jobs who is going to have money for anything. Ford the automaker knew he had to pay his workers enough to buy his automobiles.</p>
