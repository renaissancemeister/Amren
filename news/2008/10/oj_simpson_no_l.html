<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/04/simpson.usa1">OJ Simpson No Longer a Touchstone of US Racial Politics</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Caroline Davies, Guardian (Manchester), October 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thirteen years to the day of his sensational acquittal on charges of double murder, the conviction of OJ Simpson for conspiracy to kidnap and armed robbery looks unlikely to have the same dramatic impact.</p>
<p>Back in 1995, US opinion was instantly divided along racial lines. There was widespread outrage among white Americans when the footballer-turned actor walked free after being cleared of the brutal murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman.</p>
<p>Many African-Americans, however, saw it as justice for a black man persecuted and framed because of the colour of his skin.</p>
<p>Much was made of the fact the jury was predominantly black. And the world was transfixed as Simpson&rsquo;s lawyers were accused of playing the &#8220;race card&rsquo; throughout a trial that lasted almost a year and was transmitted daily to the world through court room cameras. That trial became not just a spectacle, but a racial touchstone too.</p>
<p>But this time the fate of the erstwhile all-American hero failed to capture the same intense public interest.</p>
<p>True, much may made of the significance that he was tried by an all-white jury. It has often been claimed that black jurors are more sympathetic towards black defendants than white jurors. And Simpson&rsquo;s defence lawyer has argued that African-Americans were systematically excluded by prosecutors on the grounds that they might be more likely to feel sympathy for the black boy suffering from rickets whose sporting prowess enabled him to fight his way out of a San Francisco ghetto and attain superstar status in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Two black women were dismissed from the jury panel after a contentious courtroom battle between defence and prosecution lawyers. The judge was careful to stress this was not because of their race, but because of their religious beliefs which might have made them more &#8220;forgiving&#8221; of the defendant.</p>
<p>So even now the issue of Simpson&rsquo;s colour cannot be ignored. And it is an issue his lawyers may try to use when it comes to any appeal.</p>
<p>But, will it provide the same cultural flashpoint that drew huge crowds to the court and polarised black and white American back in 1995?</p>
<p>This time, the court room was barely half full for most of the three week trial.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because America is more preoccupied with the presidential election campaign, or consumed by the economic crisis. Perhaps it is because the victims in this case, two middle-aged memorabilia dealers who are said to have tried to cash-in by attempting to sell their stories to the media, are themselves less sympathetic.</p>
<p>Or perhaps OJ Simpson himself, the much-loved No 32 of the Buffalo Bills and seen as probably the greatest player in the National Football League, is no longer the African-American hero. His reputation has been severely tarnished during his momentous fall from grace thirteen years ago.</p>
<p>Though acquitted of the murders, a subsequent civil judgment found him responsible for the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, who were found stabbed and slashed to death in June 1994. He was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages to their families, though has not done so.</p>
<p>In Florida in 2001 he was cleared of charges in a road-rage incident. In January 2003 his teenage daughter Sydney made an emotional 911 call to police after an argument with her father, but no charges were filed. He came to public attention again the following year when a neighbour of called police to report a fight, though again no charges were brought.</p>
<p>Then his judgment was seriously questioned when he tried to publish a fictitious account of the murders in a ghost written book distastefully entitled If I Did It. The publishers eventually pulped it.</p>
<p>Thirteen years ago, Simpson successfully held himself out as the victim of persecution. Now, at 61, he faces imprisonment. Just who and how many will be outraged this time remains to be seen.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s an absolute lie and the reporter knows full well he is lying by asserting such nonsense.  He doesn&rsquo;t write the true reason, because he&rsquo;s a coward.</p>
<p>Every black that was clapping and cheering the O.J. verdict wanted Simpson or any other black to win against whites or the white system, because they were/are resentful and jealous of whites, due to their inability to compete successfully against them.  The situation has gotten even worse these last thirteen years.</p>
<p>These people are so evil it makes no difference that two people were brutally murdered, because they were white, and blacks do not care one whit if whites receive justice or not.</p>
<p>Any white fool who would vote for a black deserves to be made to live among them.  Any white fool who votes for Obama is encouraging evil black behavior and attitudes, and true justice would be for her/him to fall victim to a mob of blacks on a regular basis, then when he/she came to us for solace both would have the door slammed in their faces.</p>

			<p>I still think that the OJ question is a &#8220;touchstone of racial politics,&#8221; but the media are trying to keep a lid on it, because they made the mistake last time of somewhat encouraging white people to think racially.</p>
<p>And yes, there are statistics out there about black juries and black defendants.  I&rsquo;m sure AR has done research on the matter.</p>

			<p>I walked in the shadow of O.J Simpson.In San Francisco,I went to the same Jr High school and the same High School as him, many years later.In Jr high, an idiot of a P.E teacher would hold him up to us as a role model for us to follow, saying &#8220;If O.J. can do it, so can you&#8221;. Do what? Could any of us do what he did? The football field was named after him, namely Galileo High.Now it should be named jailbird football field.</p>

			<p>Since then we&rsquo;ve had the Duke Rape hoax, Jena 6, the Hurricane Katrina mess, the Christian murders and a host of other eye opening events.  You think it&rsquo;s possible that maybe a segment of black America is too embarrassed to get involved in OJ again?</p>

			<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t care because they don&rsquo;t need him anymore.  They gaze longingly at only one person:  The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, He Who Will Make Everything All Right, Barack H. Obama.  <br>
Simpson, Sharpton, and Jackson are no longer needed by blacks.  All their hopes and dreams will be fulfilled by President Obama.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Though justice moves slowly, it seldom fails to overtake the whicked.&#8221; - Horace: Carmina, III, c. 20 B.C.</p>
<p>In this case that seems to be true.  Telling, isn&rsquo;t it, that it took a predominantly black jury to miscarry justice and an overwhelmingly White jury (there was one latino) to enforce it?</p>
<p>The day after the verdict came in I literally danced in the parking lot of my local shopping center shouting &#8220;O.J. is guilty!&#8221;  I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the smiles on the faces of more than a few Whites and the stern looks on the faces of the couple of blacks I saw.  Turnabout is fair play.</p>
<p>Now that this is all over, there are only two things left for which I&rsquo;m hopeful:</p>
<p>1) O.J. rots in prison</p>
<p>2) Fred Goldman and his attorney happily dine on all of O.J&rsquo;s assets.</p>

			<p> Because he was tried by an all White jury his lawyers are<br>
planning to appeal. But it is interesting how in 1995, he <br>
was let off by a predominantly Black jury. And his lawyers<br>
and the media had no problem whatsoever with that. </p>

			<p>I disagree.  The reason blacks supported OJ so much in his first trial is because he butchered two white people.  That is something that many blacks want to see any black get away with.  If the same crime happened today, the racial schism would still be there.  Debating a black person about the first OJ verdict is a lesson in futility.  They know he did it.  They know you know he did it.  They know that you know that they know he did it.  But they&rsquo;ll never admit that they believe he did it.</p>

			<p>The fact is that White America has always had it out for O.J. Simpson. </p>
<p>They could not get over the fact that he was acquitted of a crime that millions of White people have been acquitted for thousands of time throughout history. This was payback pure and simple.</p>
<p>White racism and vindictive behavior are rampant in America!</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s time for people to see this so called &#8220;foot ball hero&#8221;<br>
for what he really is. He is an imagaginary &#8220;hero&#8221; who can<br>
 play sports and also kill people. I view him as a thug who has <br>
been treated as royality by those who see sports differently<br>
than I do. Time for people to wake up to what the sports heros<br>
really are &#8220;thugs&#8221; no more or less.</p>

			<p>He will appeal and try to get a new trial. If Obama becomes our next Prisident OJ will get a full pardon. wait and see. He can&rsquo;t lose. OJ is a very slippery guy. </p>

			<p>Anyone with half a brain who followed Simpson&rsquo;s first trial knew he was guilty of a brutal double murder. So it would be entirely fitting if he got life for this break in charge. I hope they throw the proverbial book at Simpson. And this time I don&rsquo;t think blacks are paying that much attention. They are too busy going crazy for their boy Obama.</p>

			<p>I remember the heebie-jeebies I had that day in 1995 as I rode the subway &amp; walked to my job in midtown Manhattan.  Icy stares from the &#8220;blacks&#8221; abounded.  Of course, that was nothing new; in fact, that was &amp; is the norm.  No riots of note ensued in NYC.</p>
<p>The California &#8220;blacks&#8221; sure stuck it to the man that day, didn&rsquo;t they?  Now, they&rsquo;re living like kings thanks to their prompt rioting over that disrespected football hero.</p>

<p><i>This time, the court room was barely half full for most of the three week trial.<br>
Perhaps it was because America is more pre-occupied with the presidential election, or consumed by the economic crisis.<br>
 <br>
So even now the issue of Simpson&rsquo;s colour cannot be ignored. And it is an issue his lawyers may try to use when it comes to any appeal. </i><br>
  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
This time, sex, money, and glamour were not issues involved. Not even race. There were no attractive blondes, famous restaurants,  big names, or Beverly Hills mansions.  Just some middle aged men having a tussle in an inexpensive hotel room.  And all of the characters were, by now, considerably older     &mdash;    OJ is now 61 and a faded star, no longer constantly  before the public eye as he once was  (thanks to those Hertz commercials). Many younger people wouldn&rsquo;t know  him.<br>
 <br>
And yes, the political campaign plus the looming economic crisis are now hogging all the public&rsquo;s attention.  There are bigger irons in the fire.  This time there was no media circus about OJ.  And no flamboyant black lawyer like Cochran. I did not even know the trial was on until I saw the results being announced on TV.</p>
<p>One further point,  though.  If there should be an appeal  (whether soon or anywhere in the future) presented under an Obama presidency,   I wonder what the results will be.  This could get very interesting.   Will we be seeing some of that &#8220;change&#8221;  we&rsquo;ve been told about?   The OJ story may  not be over yet.</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;re too close to Election Day for blacks to start their usual antics.  I bet we won&rsquo;t see any demonstrations of any kind and I guarantee the black crime rate will be down in October then resume their normal shenanigans right after the race.</p>

			<p>In all fairness I think the kidnapping conviction was a sort of unfair legal overkill. Did he take the vitims to another site? I don`t think so. If holding a gun on someone and telling them &#8220;Don`t move!&#8221; qualifies as kidnapping then every convience store robber should be doing Federal time. Hmmm&hellip; maybe they ARE on to something there!</p>

			<p>The views blacks hold on Simpson are a good example of how blacks live their whole lives with rationalization and self-deception. Witness the post by &#8220;Terell&#8221; how &#8220;millions&#8221; of Whites got away with this crime &#8220;thousands&#8221; of times. (That would actually mean that MOST of them DIDN&rsquo;T get away with it. Assuming they committed the crime at all). Blacks live their whole lives believing the most outlandish things. It may be a physoclogical defence mechanism. The truth that their low-IQ&rsquo;s and lack of abilities - and not &#8220;racism&#8221; - makes them fail is an insight too painful to accept.</p>

<p>They had it out for him because they knew he did it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They could not get over the fact that he was acquitted of a crime that millions of White people have been acquitted for thousands of time throughout history. This was payback pure and simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t surprise me. All blacks today have to do is play the race card and they pretty much get away with anything and no, millions of white people haven&rsquo;t been acquitted for thousands of murders. Spare us the nonsense.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;White racism and vindictive behavior are rampant in America!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense, no other country on earth pampers blacks like America. </p>

			<p>For the most part, us &#8216;bigots&rsquo; dont really care. What goes around, comes around. OJ did himself in by being a part of this crime. He could have done a variety of things that didnt involve participating in felonies. He got what is coming to him. The fact that it seems like justice regarding the murders he obviously comitted, just makes it feel a bit better. OJ is his own worst enemy, and I sincerely hope he spends the rest of his life in prison, and is forgotten for his NFL triumphs. </p>

			<p>The Black Racial perception of justice is different than that of whites, that is evident in the Affirmative Action driven supply of African lawyers, politicians and judges. If white and blacks had similar concepts of justice, then there would be no need to stress race in these issue.</p>
<p>For that reason, OJ Simpson got white justice, being that all the jurors were white. He should have had an all black jury, thus a jury of his peers. It is only fair that each defendent has a jury that &#8220;looks like them&#8221;, as Secretary of State Rice stated, (and she should know about race based justice).</p>
<p>The idea you can have a mixed jury, or a jury of different skin color than the defendent IS injustice. OJ should get a re-trial with an All-African jury so that &#8220;black&#8221; justice could exert itself.  Also, the lawyers and judge should also be African.</p>
<p>This is the only fair and just thing to do since it is recodgnized today (even by Law Schools) that blacks are different and should not be forced into &#8220;white&#8221; law where they are expect to &#8220;act white&#8221;. That is racism.</p>

			<p>Burr wrote that Pres. Obama will pardon OJ.  I thought exactly the same thing.  OJ only has to cool his heels for four years (or eight years if he&rsquo;s reelected), and wait for the pardon during the waning days of Obama&rsquo;s first or second administration.  It will be easy for him to justify:  no one got hurt (not like in LA in 1994), it was basically lowlifes preying on lowlifes, and Obama will have &#8220;grave concerns&#8221; about the &#8220;racial makeup of the jury&#8221; and the &#8220;Batson issue not addressed by the appellate court&#8221; (that&rsquo;s lawyer stuff saying potential jurors were kicked off the panel for reasons of race), and &#8220;for those reasons, I have decided to issue Mr. Simpson a full pardon.&#8221;  </p>

			<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s not going to get sentenced until the first week in December, so take heart in the fact this black satan will undergo much inner turmoil for the next several weeks.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at a point in his life where every day he spends in jail is a day that has a far greater impact on him than if he were  younger. No time is good for jail time, but a person&rsquo;s 60&rsquo;s are not the best years to spend in the slammer. He only has a few years of his life left that might be free of severe ailments of old age, and what a pity that he could well spend most of those years incarcerated in a damp, dark jail.</p>

<p>Actually, the operative word is &#8220;delighted&#8221;.  A number of us are absolutely delighted.  What we have seen here is called &#8220;Gambler&rsquo;s Ruin&#8221;.  Someone with poor self-control and little common sense gets away with something once.  Encouraged, he continues to take chances (road rage, armed robbery, and kidnapping in this case) and eventually it all blows up in his face.  I suspect the property he was attempting to recover really had been stolen from him.  I also suspect that if he had filed a police report over the matter, describing what the items were, who had them, and where, things would have gone very differently.  The dealer of sports collectables would have been told to explain exactly where he obtained the items, and they would have been confiscated until his and OJ&rsquo;s stories could be checked out.</p>
<p>OJ&rsquo;s problem in court was mainly the fact that he had co-defendants who were not willing to take a major fall for him.  They pleaded guilty to reduced charges in exchange for their own testimony.  With the murders, he didn&rsquo;t have any co-defendants prosecutors could break.  The thing to remember about co-defendants and people turning state&rsquo;s witness is that the last one on the bus always gets the worst seat.</p>
<p>In closing, as a thought experiment, I would like the &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; here to imagine the public spectacle if a white guy had been accused of the slashing murders of the white mother of two half-black kids and her Jewish boyfriend.</p>

			<p>Everybody knows that the blacks in this country wanted OJ to go free simply because he is black. They didn&rsquo;t care that he murdered 2 people and his DNA present at the crime scene, no matter how small an amount, didn&rsquo;t matter at all.  They all claimed it was placed there deliberately by Mark Fuhrman, a 20 year veteran detective.  OJ&rsquo;s acquitall all those years ago was, according to the majority of blacks in this country, retribution for Rodney King and all of the past trials of black man who were &#8220;framed&#8221; by racist white cops, racist white juries, racist white prosecutors and racist white judges.  </p>
<p>Any reasonable thinking person, knew that OJ was guilty, you could see it on his face the day they arraigned him, not to mention the fact that he tried to run with cash, a passport and disguises.  Anybody that thought he would be found guilty of those 2 murders was a nitwit.  Even if the jury had been all white, he was going free.  Nobody wanted another riot scene like 1992 after Rodney King, which makes our justice system totally bogus.</p>
<p>I hardly paid any attention to this new trial but pretty much figured that if OJ was involved, whatever they were saying the newspapers, was probably true.  I was, to say the least, surprised they found him guity but I also knew that his attorney would rant that he was found guilty because of racism.  Same old story.</p>
<p>If he goes to jail for the rest of his life - so be it.  He&rsquo;ll be among friends.  The same black community that embraced him after his acquittal of double murder, didn&rsquo;t care that he had completely abandoned his black roots when he took up with his white wife.  He was one of them 100% after he butchered her and her friend and he&rsquo;ll one of them when he gets to prison.</p>

			<p>Interesting. Thirteen years ago an obviously guilty Simpson walked free and blacks in L.A. (and elsewhere) hooted and hollered like immature children. Now Simpson is right back where he was and the blacks have been virtually pushed out of L.A. by Hispanic newcomers. What a short-sighted Pyrrhic vitory it was for them. Not at all surprising really. Blacks aren&rsquo;t known for having long-term horizons. As for Simpson all he did with his 13 years of undeserved reprieve was to indulge in golf, parties and groupies. </p>

<p>Where&rsquo;s the bigotry in this? O.J. is guilty of a crime and is paying the price. How has/is he being discriminated against (I assume racially), if anything he has benefited, yes. <br>
The only injustice was in his favor (double homicide no less). </p>
<p>OJ was given 13 years of freedom that was undeserved after killing 2 human beings brutally, he tried to make money off the murders with his &#8216;if I did it&rsquo; book.</p>
<p>He was given a second chance in life and he blew it by showing his true colors (no pun). He&rsquo;s going to end up where he belongs.<br>

<p>No one sane believes Manson is innocent or was railroaded by an &#8216;unjust&rsquo; legal system and NO ONE is demanding that he be set free. There is no White &#8216;Free Manson!&rsquo; movement bankrolled by Whites. </p>
<p>The preponderance of evidence proved Manson guilty, as it did OJ. Manson, however, was found guilty; OJ, was acquitted by an idiot jury despite all the proof that he committed the murders (or as Larry Elder writes: &#8220;OJ left everything except his calling card at the crime scene.&#8221;).</p>
<p>James:  Do you believe OJ killed Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman or do you believe he is innocent, accused by an unjust, racist, White-controlled legal system that was out to &#8216;bring down yet one more black man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>If you believe OJ to be innocent of the double murders, who do you think committed them?</p>
<p>However, when it comes to black criminals, according to &#8216;columnist&rsquo; jasmine cannick, this is how the black community reacts:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;When boxer Mike Tyson was convicted of raping Miss Black Rhode Island, Desiree Washington, in an Indianapolis hotel room, for which he served three years in prison, we threw him a parade upon his release.</p>
<p>When singer R. Kelly finally went to trial for 12 counts of child pornography, after a video of what really looked like him urinating on an underage girl surfaced online and in every hood across America, we stood in front of the courthouse with signs that read &#8216;free R. Kelly&rsquo; and continued to flock to his concerts and buy his albums.</p>
<p>And even when football legend and actor O.J. Simpson was acquitted of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson, a white woman, and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1995&hellip;I remember hearing the shouts of praise, hallelujah, and glory to God coming from houses up and down the street as Black people came out of their homes and celebrated&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to explain to us why the black community embraces black criminals?</p>

 <br>
Instead, another possibility exists:  Some compliant judge looking for advancement and knowing how to play the game, will be found who will review the appeal and resolve that the verdict was racially biased, the jury was unrepresentative,  the evidence was defective, etc.   In that way, the verdict will be overrurned, Obama will never have to touch it, and some  hitherto obscure judge will be on the fast track to the Supreme Court.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;I still don&rsquo;t get guys like Terrell. Don&rsquo;t you get it brother? O.J. Simpson was never a black man in the operative sense of the word.  He never hung out with blacks in his whole life, after becoming a football star. <br>
 <br>
What is this weird allegiance some of you black people have towards this guy? He doesn&rsquo;t care about you.&#8221;</i><br>

You have a good point there, Bobby. For an even better example, look at Michael Jackson, someone who effectively rejected being black in the most dramatic way that he could: via surgery and chemicals!  In every way, he tried to make himself white.  He managed to turn himself from a black man into a white woman!  Yet, when he found himself in deep trouble, he suddenly remembered his black roots.  And the blacks, instead of telling him to get lost (which they should have), rallied to give him their overwhelming suppport.  </p>
<p>Same with Mariah Carey, when she was having her troubles too. She only remembered she was &#8220;black&#8221; when she needed their support. Until then, she had been passing quite successfully as &#8220;white&#8221; and had conveniently forgotten all about any awkward black roots. But they took her back when she needed them.<br>

<p> Your analogy is flawed. The people you mention did not kill Blacks. They killed Whites. Would the black community have been so supportive of Simpson had Nicole and Goldman been black? Nor did the people you mention exploit the race card as Simpson so shamelessly did.</p>

			<p>Look, this is how I see it pure and simple. I find it appalling and shameful as an African American that 13 years ago, the jurors (especially the black jurors) felt about O.J. that there is no way on God&rsquo;s green earth he is capable of murder or responsible in any way shape or form.<br>
When I first heard those tapes of what he did to Nicole, I thought, she should have ran out as fast as she could, NOT a color issue, but an issue of moral ethics and personal responsibility. 13 years ago, I was verbally insulted and attacked because from the jump; I always felt that &#8220;HE DID IT&#8221; no doubt in my mind, some of my friends would say either&hellip;<br>
1. He didn&rsquo;t do it, but he knows who did.<br>
2. He&rsquo;s probably covering for his son<br>
3. He&rsquo;s covering for his best friend A.C.<br>
4. Mark Furhman had it in for him, ALWAYS and set him up<br>
5. He&rsquo;s still looking for the killers<br>
bla, bla, bla&hellip;I have to agree on this panel for once, any CLEAR thinking human, white or black can see this man is a killer and 13 years ago justice was NOT served.<br>
Many blacks will not ever accept or want to face reality that a once legendary athlete such as O.J. do something as heinous, if you can&rsquo;t see it, you are living in the land of OZ! Hopefully and finally, he can spend the rest of his miserable life behind bars where he should be, I spit on the man and pray he gets his rightly deserved justice.</p>

<p>As for the recent robbery, I agree, something smells a little fishy about the whole deal, but again, &#8220;You lay down with dogs, you&rsquo;ll wind up with fleas.&#8221; Bottom line; O.J. was greedy, didn&rsquo;t want to pay his judgement, wanted to live the &#8220;free fugitive life&#8221; <br>
thought, once again, he could beat the system and hooked up with a bunch of shady thugs-and got caught, FINALLY! He just couldn&rsquo;t resist his greedy urges and smug-like attitude and that did him in. Good riddance!</p>

<p>I despise O.J. Simpson. He should have been put under the jail the first go round. But a black jury let him go because they were obviously too intellectually inferior to assess a preponderance of evidence effectively.</p>
<p>Same thing with Rodney King, the Reginald Denny beating, the Jena Six, and on and on.</p>
<p>They respond on a purely emotional level and are incapable of making all but the most basic of judgments. And oftimes even those are made ineptly.Look at the history of black nations, communities and cities governed by blacks, and this is painfully obvious.</p>
<p> But what can you expect of a racial demographic with a median IQ of 85?</p>

<p>You are missing the point. The fact is that when Simpson was exonerated of his crimes in 1995, Blacks were not cheering for him directly. In fact, many of them were indifferent to Simpson. </p>
<p>What they were cheering was the fact that a Black man got away with double murder scot free for killing two Whites! They would have cheered for any Black person who did such a horrible thing, not just Simspon</p>

<p>Karl does have a point. To refer to someone as a beast is a bit extreme. I am certainly not a fan of Simpson and I am glad he got his just desserts, but we have to be mindful of the fact that it is important to live in a civil society.  </p>
<p>I am not familiar with the artilce where this was published, however, the fact is that refering to one another person as a beast is going too far.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>Civil societies are civil because they recognized EVIL for what it is and created a system of justice to deal with it &mdash; a system designed to harshly punish or eliminate those who cause harm in order to protect those who are innocent, otherwise anarchy, brutality and chaos reign as they do in so many un-civil parts of the world such as Africa.</p>
<p>OJ, against all the tenants of a civil society, mercilessly BUTCHERED two Whites. His trial was an utter travesty of justice.  If justice had prevailed, he would be sitting on death row.<br>
  <br>
Here is how Nicole&rsquo;s body was described:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Her neck appeared to have been slashed, almost severing her head from her body, blood had flowed from the wound down the pathway towards the street, almost to the gate fifteen feet away&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Neighbors and cops described a lake and a &#8216;river of blood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ronald Goldman&rsquo;s body was described:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;His left leg, stretched out over his bent right limb, was saturated in blood. His light brown shirt had been pulled up and was bunched around his back, indicating that the killer may have grabbed him, swung him around in the fight, or even killed him on the walkway, and then for some reason dragged his body to the spot where he lay. His throat appeared to have been slashed and he had other stab wounds to his body and upper left thigh&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>How do you think you&rsquo;d feel if this were one of YOUR loved ones?</p>
<p>Do you believe Fred Goldman thinks &#8216;beast&rsquo; is too harsh a term to use to describe the murderer of his only son?</p>
<p>Let me ask you this:  What term would YOU use to describe a savage, brutal killer who butchered two innocent people? What would you call someone who slaughtered the mother of his children while they were asleep nearby?</p>
<p>What I want to call this killer would not be printed on this board.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It was a fact that one of the jurors referred to O.J. Simpson as a BEAST!!! This was disgusting!&#8221;</p>
<p>He is a beast. Anyone, black or white, that butchers two people is. </p>
<p>&#8220;This person should have been removed from the jury.&#8221;</p>
<p>If this were known, then his lawyer could have had it done.</p>
<p> &#8220;No one ever referred to Susan Smith who drowned her two children in a lake in South Carolina, Charles Stuart who killed his pregnant wife by shooting her in the head or Robert Blake who shot his wife in a fashion that was eerily reminiscent of the first episode of his television show Baretta - a BEAST!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, actually all of these people were referred to as evil, psycho and I&rsquo;m sure beasts also etc. Unlike O.J. who killed two people, Susan Smith killed two people and is doing life.</p>

<p>Robert Blake was found not guilty of killing his wife(both are white). However, I think he did do it and if he had been an average guy, would likely being in jail for a long time. Last I heard on Phil Spector, accused of killing a woman(again both white) in his home, there was a mistrial. He&rsquo;ll likely be retried for murder. I believe he did it too and if he were an average joe, would likely have been found guilty the first time and  in prison. Just my two cents.</p>

<p>Yes, and Blake lost his corresponding civil trial just as OJ did and was assessed damages of 1million dollars less than OJ (call it affirmative action).  </p>
<p>The point being that all three killed white women, but we are only upset about one, why?</p>

<p>Simply put, Bonnie Lee Bakley, Robert Blake&rsquo;s wife, was a con artist who preyed on lonely, wealthy old men in order to swindle them out of large amounts of money.  The feeling I got (from talking to people and reading &#8220;letters to the editor&#8221; of various online newspapers) was &#8220;she had it coming.&#8221;  Right or wrong, that appears to have been the attitude of a lot of people.</p>

<p>As for the Lana Clarkson murder case?  Use your own imagination as to why the media handled Phil Spector with kid gloves. </p>

<p>Both Blake and Bakley were lacking in morality. Blake also was a jerk to his first wife and not a nice person. He also knew what Bakley was when he married her and the two deserved each other. Having said that, there was no justification for shooting her and he was totally at fault.</p>
