<h1>Drugs, Alcohol Worsening Problems for Seminoles</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, September 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The average age at death among Seminole Indians in Florida has dropped by 12 years in the past decade, according to a newspaper analysis, to below age 50.</p>
<p>Figures obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel show 11 of the tribe&rsquo;s 17 recorded deaths in 2008 have been related to drugs or alcohol. Further, the average age of a Seminole at death has dropped from nearly 60 in 1997 to 48 in 2007.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s well below the average age statewide of 73 years old.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some suggested the tribe&rsquo;s staggering wealth, earned from its gaming operations, have left young members without life balance. The tribe provides each member a free education, guaranteed job and an income of roughly $120,000 a year.</p>
<p>Zena Simmons, a 24-year-old Seminole and Florida Atlantic student, said she sees a correlation between the money and excess. So does her sister, 29-year-old Thomasine Jumper, who is now jailed for drug and traffic offenses in Collier County.</p>

			<p>Wealth frees up valuable time and resources from having to just survive.  A people either use that to improve themselves or destroy themselves.  If they have no interest, or even concept, of the higher virtues, the latter results.</p>
<p>This is why generosity toward the colored races is so damaging. Idle hands do the devil&rsquo;s work is true in a LITERAL sense for them.  The darker the skin color, the worse this is.  You can see this in the extreme, with africa&hellip;.where a black person kept from starvation today, by American food aid, immediately takes up a weapon and kills his neighbor.  Only survival pressure keeps them from eachothers (and ours) throats.  All they see when a shipment of food aid arrives, is an opportunity to kill.  They think to themselves, &#8220;ah, OK, that takes care of my need to eat today, so instead of grubbing for food somehow, I&rsquo;m going to kill my neighbor and rape his daughter&#8221;.</p>
<p>White MUST understand this about the colored races&hellip;.or our generosity is going to destroy them&hellip;and ourselves in the process.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no question most Indian tribes got screwed, but I can&rsquo;t feel a bit of pity here&hellip;&hellip;..particularly when I&rsquo;m just barely keeping a roof over my head and missing meals to do so.</p>

<p>Before that, they complained that they drank themselves into a stupor, because the white man stole their land.</p>
<p>So, if they don&rsquo;t have enough money they&rsquo;re victims.  And when they have too much money they&rsquo;re victims also.</p>
<p>Is anybody wondering about now why the government should have been criticized for not allowing them to buy firewater?</p>

			<p>If money is so much of a problem for them, well, I&rsquo;ll be more than happy to help them out by accepting any and all donations&hellip; even though I&rsquo;m a white person of Russian/German Jewish descent whose ancestors never screwed over a native American in their lives. </p>
<p>The last few years have been pretty brutal on me, my significant other, and my cats.  I got a pay cut of about 30%, and I&rsquo;m still struggling to catch up with the bills. </p>
<p>Where do I stand in line to get $120,000 per year?  I&rsquo;d sure have loved it if someone would have paid my way through college, instead of (sob) having to work and go to school at the same time and still never finishing a degree. </p>

<p>Well, I do agree with this much. I live in an Hispanic barrio and have made friends with some of the more tolerable gangbanger type idiots (more like gang associates). Pls understand that in these neighborhoods, almost 100% of the young Hispanic males will be either bangers or associates. The non-participants in this culture hardly exist.</p>
<p>I have been trying very hard to civilize this one guy, who has befriended me. The operation has been ongoing for about a year now. I think I would have had better luck training a dog. He seems to be uncivilizable. It&rsquo;s also clear that $$ would not help these &#8220;poor people&#8221; one bit. They would act just the same, but would probably destroy themselves that much quicker. Concepts of eating right, regular exercise, weight control, moderation in intoxicants, ability to budget money or delay gratification are all completely alien and have nothing to do with poverty. </p>
<p>The local Indians here are acting the same way. They get $7000/month cash for sitting on their butts. Most of them blow every nickel the minute it hits their fingers. Drug and alcohol abuse is very high. The weird thing is they are making $85,000 per person in a multiperson family and you drive by and they still live in a shack, have lots of kids out of wedlock, and there are all these chickens running all over the yard. All that money and not the slightest thing to show for it.  Why can&rsquo;t they plan ahead?</p>

			<p>The first step towards a solution is to grant them full and unqualified American citizenship, and to eliminate the ridiculous idea of &#8220;sovereign nations&#8221; within the United States.<br>
In other words, no such thing as &#8220;Indian&#8221;. All are Americans at once, with no special privileges.<br>

<p>Amen to that. Less emphasis on the &#8220;Native,&#8221; and more emphasis on the &#8220;American.&#8221; To include paying taxes.</p>
