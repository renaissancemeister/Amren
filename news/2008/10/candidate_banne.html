						<p>The sign went up Sunday evening, bold black letters against the stark white background of the marquee at the Colony South Hotel &amp; Conference Center in Clinton: &#8220;Country First. McCain/Palin.&#8221;</p>
<p>By daybreak, pandemonium had broken loose all across heavily Democratic Prince George&rsquo;s County. Many local supporters of Democrat Barack Obama, jolted by the message as they headed down Branch Avenue on their Monday morning commutes, grabbed cellphones and BlackBerrys to notify friends. Operators of neighborhood e-mail group lists cried foul to their memberships. The NAACP logged calls. Community leaders demanded boycotts of the hotel, a common venue for Democratic events.</p>
<p>&#8220;Businesspeople have to be mindful of the sentiments and sensibilities of their market trading area, and Prince George&rsquo;s County is overwhelmingly for Obama,&#8221; said community activist Arthur Turner of Kettering, who was among those advocating a boycott. &#8220;People I have talked to look at the sign as a slap in the face. They feel it was blatant disrespect. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have heard people say they will no longer patronize Colony South because of that disrespect.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outcry over the hotel marquee tapped into the passion &mdash; and sometimes anger &mdash; that has characterized this fall&rsquo;s presidential campaign. Supporters of Republican candidate John McCain have vented their rage at rallies this week, applauding thunderously as McCain&rsquo;s running mate, Sarah Palin, accused Obama of &#8220;palling around with terrorists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prince George&rsquo;s, though, is clearly Obama Country. As the nation&rsquo;s wealthiest mostly black community, where about 77 percent of registered voters are Democrats, residents have Obama placards in their yards, bumper stickers on their cars and the candidate&rsquo;s visage on their T-shirts.</p>
<p>The marquee supporting the GOP ticket in &#8220;an area that is strongly African American was like putting a stink bomb in the middle of the living room,&#8221; said University of Maryland political Professor Ron Walters. &#8220;What it does show is the emotions that are around this campaign and this election.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colony South General Manager Alan Vahabzadeh said that the hotel, one of several Washington area businesses that has dared to venture into the political thicket, got the message after about 100 phone calls and three dozen e-mails. The sign came down Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Friday afternoon, motorists noticed new signs &mdash; broad banners attached to wooden stakes in the hotel&rsquo;s front yard &mdash; again touting the Republicans.</p>
<p>Vahabzadeh did not return later calls seeking comment, but an employee said the phones were again ringing with complaints.</p>
<p>And Democratic activists started talking boycott. That could mean canceling political events at the hotel and urging residents to skip its Wednesday night karaoke events and Sunday brunches.</p>

			<p>This is just another example of how the races differ at an organic level.  Blacks are a  tribal people.  They cannot function in a modern democracy.  They need a strong leader and strictly enforced structures (force or superstition will do) to survive.  The fact that someone in their midst might have a differing opinion is anathema to them.  Ask Clarence Thomas.  I doubt if there is a single black on the street who could tell you why they don&rsquo;t like Justice Thomas or react so viscerally to Republicans.  They just know they are &#8220;the other&#8221;.  So it is fine to chop off their heads, or whatever they&rsquo;re allowed to get away with in modern society.</p>

			<p>Actually, for a highly visible business to loudly take sides for any presidential candidate shows a lack of common sense, since it risks alienating voters for the other side.  However, that should be the decision of the business owner(s).  If he wants to risk losing business, so be it.  Activist loonies who make threats and who attempt to intimidate the owners of the business should be arrested and prosecuted.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Shows the emotions around this campaign and election&#8221;  I am now reconsidering doing what everybody has already warned against. Not being home on election night. In fact I`ll be halfway between Vegas and getting home Tuesday night. Now I`m contemplating, no make that planning, on a twenty -two hour straight drive so I can be locked in and locked down  by  7:00pm on election night. <br/>
 This article helped sway me. But what convinced me a night ago was seeing a ten second sound bite of a Black Obama supporter. The guy was about to explode with frenzy. Four  hundred years they`ve waited. It`s gonna be Moses time or the night they shot Lincoln all over again. Either scenario scares the beejeezus out of me. I`ll be making sure I make it with the lil lady already having flown home. Anybody ever drive 24 straight with tips for me?!?&hellip;</p>

			<p> People who don&rsquo;t have enough important things to occupy their time get mad over political signs. They&rsquo;re all over the place in my small Midwestern city right now, and most people have the good sense to ignore them.</p>
<p> It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that blacks in a majority-black county, who would be the first and loudest to insist on their &#8220;rights,&#8221; are also the first to yell, scream and protest about someone else exercising THEIR rights! If you don&rsquo;t like the message on a political sign, then vote the other way on election day. And by the way, why would anyone who owns a business be dumb enough to put political signs up on it, at the risk of offending half their customers?</p>

Not liking someone&rsquo;s political views is one thing, boycotts and intimidation are completely different. Intimidating people because they support someone you don&rsquo;t like is a slap in the face of American values. This is similar to all the democratic sheriffs and other elected officials who are intimidating their constituents that haven&rsquo;t jumped on the Obama bandwagon. Despite the disgusting tactics they use (voter fraud, libel, etc.), democrats and minorities always portray themselves as the the ones being wronged. We all know that despite posing as defenders of tolerance and justice, liberals have no respect for either. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re feeling religious fervor at the sight of a &#8216;heresy&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>This election is about more than just selecting a good leader. It is, for some, the closest they will ever get to feeling a part of an ideological crusade in support of their messiah figure.  </p>

<p>If they&rsquo;re black, and the hotel is local, then the answer is that black dope slingers and dope gangs love to rent multiple rooms at local hotels or motels after they&rsquo;ve had a good week of business, and waste a lot of money on parties, so that they can do their &#8220;thizzle.&#8221;  In St. Louis, the relatively inexpensive hotels and motels near Lambert Airport are infamous for these kinds of &#8220;parties.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drink lots of coffee and soda.  This means you will have to take lots of bathroom breaks which will keep you awake.</p>
<p>And stop and take short naps every 6 hours or so.  Bring a travel alarm to wake you up.</p>
<p>Depending on your age, you might want to rub some Bengay on your knees, especially the right one. </p>

<p>I just logged it in to my rolodex so I will know where to stay should I get back in that area.  I don&rsquo;t like McCain, but anything to aggreviate an open wound&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe if Jared Taylor gets chased out of Virginia, the next annual convention can be set up in Clinton???</p>

			<p>America was doomed the moment the government began forcing citizens to live, work, recreate, and socialize with people from other cultures whom they dislike and have nothing in common with. Multiculturalism is unnatural. Forced diversity destroyed all natural social cohesion and the family order. Most people today don&rsquo;t give a damn about anyone of their own race or culture, let alone beings from another race or culture. The bottom line is that government wants it that way. Less communication equates to organization and less of a threat to their processes of tyranny. </p>

			<p>Sorry, Tim McHugh, but you should NOT be taken in by that &#8220;elect Obama or fear our wrath&#8221; bull droppings. I &#8220;carry&#8221; and while I am not about to go looking for trouble.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how long Blacks &#8220;waited&#8221;. It is not race bringing their Messiah down; but his Marxist/Communist ideology; his way of thinking. But most Blacks are hardly up to that caliber of reasoning. Like that fool in Kenya (Africa) who is unshakeably convinced that Obama, if elected, will buy him a new motorcycle.</p>

			<p>First they said that it is Obama country there, and then they tell us that it is 77% Democratic. Does that not leave 23% that probably are for McCain/Palin? So are these voters not allowed to show their support? I suppose they should be run out of Dodge, huh sheriff? Too much. Lets get this over with and separate the races. That is what they seem to want. Of course, they will have to be the ones to suggest this, can&rsquo;t have the racist whites making the suggestion.</p>

When someone&rsquo;s Democrat signs were stolen in our county in &#8216;04, it made the news. The big, bad Republicans were guilty of a terrible crime but the Democrats are not?</p>

			<p>We have all seen pictures of the squalid conditions of Calcutta, Mombai and such places and I can tell you that here in Kuwait where those people live!!!! the same squalid conditions prevail. I have a scene RIGHT NOW!! downstairs where trash is piled up NEXT!! to an empty dumpster. Trash crews won&rsquo;t pick it up if it isn&rsquo;t in the dumpsters and these people can&rsquo;t get it through their heads. I&rsquo;m talking about Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis here, they are just plain untidy people who do not understand safety, gravity or hygeine.</p>

Drive 55mph and you may survive the crash, but best wishes and I know you will make it OK. I had hoped to be home for election night but it&rsquo;s not gonna happen.  I voted already too. Honestly, my best wishes to all of you and go vote, it may make a difference this time.</p>
