<h1>Some in Cicero Take Issue With Flying of Mexican Flag in Park</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Ruzich, Chicago Tribune, October 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a town once predominantly Eastern European but now mostly Mexican, there&rsquo;s a flag flap blowing in the wind.</p>
<p>Cicero residents recently complained that the Mexican flag was flying at the town&rsquo;s new Cicero Community Park.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. and Illinois flags, as well as a sports flag, are flown there, some longtime residents accused town officials of being un-American and demanded the Mexican flag be taken down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cicero resident Helen Brave, 75, said she was shocked to see the Mexican flag flying when she attended the opening of the South Laramie Avenue park, which is touted by town officials as their version of Millennium Park.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cicero Town President Larry Dominick &mdash; who is up for re-election next year and often must juggle the concerns of both longtime residents and newer Hispanic residents &mdash; said last week that the Mexican flag was flown during the park&rsquo;s Labor Day weekend opening in celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month.</p>
<p>He said the flag was taken down shortly after but put up again around Sept. 15 to celebrate El Grito, a holiday honoring Mexico&rsquo;s independence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the Town Hall, foreign flags &mdash; including Mexican, Italian, Irish and Greek &mdash; are normally rotated, a town official said.</p>
<p>Brave said Cicero should pass an ordinance that would prohibit the flying of foreign flags on public property.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other suburbs with growing Hispanic populations, like Berwyn and Aurora, do not have flag ordinances.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Aurora last year passed a controversial ordinance that includes the banning of celebratory flag-waving aimed at curbing what some people have deemed out-of-control impromptu celebrations.</p>
<p>In Cicero, Town Trustee Maria Punzo-Arias told residents the demographics have changed in the town of about 82,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to understand that Cicero is more than 80 percent Hispanic now,&#8221; Punzo-Arias said. {snip}<br>

<p>This only one of dozens of instances that point to the fact that diversity is a failure, because most all third world rabble support their tribes and their countries of origin and amount to nothing more than colonizers.  This is especially true of Hispanics.</p>
<p>Along with the self-exclusion of Hispanics into American society, it can be said that blacks are even worse and concern themselves only with anything that affects their race.  Diversity is a dismal failure and the only answer to the problem is racial partition, and it will certainly come about.  The only question is whether it will be peaceful or violent.</p>

			<p>If it is 80% Mexican what is the flap all about? Cicero is their town (or will be quite soon). Demography = Destiny.</p>

<p>That sums up the situation doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Does anyone have the facts and figures on crime and school performance for this &#8216;hood?</p>

<p>You also have to understand that Mexican immigrants and their families aren&rsquo;t Americans - they&rsquo;re Mexicans here for economic convenience and gain that&rsquo;s why they fly the Mexican flag on public property.  Cicero is four-fifths Mexico.</p>

Why are we in the US &#8220;celebrating&#8221; Mexico&rsquo;s independence? And just how many of these &#8220;Mexican Independence Days&#8221; are we supposed to celebrate? Just shows these people have no intention whatsoever of giving any loyalty to the US. Their loyalties lie with Mexico.</p>

			<p>It is illegal to fly a flag other than OLD Goly!</p>
<p>United States Code Section 7, Title Four, which states,</p>
<p><br>
(c) No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right of the flag of the United States of America, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for the personnel of the Navy. No person shall display the flag of the United Nations or any other national or international flag equal, above, or in a position of superior prominence or honor to, or in place of, the flag of the United States at any place within the United States or any Territory or possession thereof: Provided, That nothing in this section shall make unlawful the continuance of the practice heretofore followed of displaying the flag of the United Nations in a position of superior prominence or honor, and other national flags in positions of equal prominence or honor, with that of the flag of the United States at the headquarters of the United Nations.</p>

<p>This means two things, one if they are waving Mexican flags they are Mexican nationals, in allegiance and likely citizenship as well.  And it also means that we need to allow foreign nationals to pretend they are still in their mother countries.</p>
<p>Why do we &#8220;need&#8221; to do that?</p>

<p>Yep, because greedy White people made it that way, because the rich Whites needed an underclass to do all the dirty work. Don&rsquo;t blame US, White people.. you have given us the greatest opportunity in the world to make money without bothering to learn the local language and customs. Thank you!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not the point. Are these people American or Mexican? If they consider themselves Mexican, then they need to go back to Mexico. This is the USA.</p>

			<p>There is more of this nonsense going on than most Americans would dare allow themselves to believe - and it is going on in virtually every state in the union!! Most of these ethnic/Hispanic enclaves are fully supported by local authorites, organizers/lobbying groups, chambers of commerce, businesses, etc. In other words, they are WELL supported and protected - and don&rsquo;t for a second think they are going anywhere, or planning to change. Just imagine how bad it will be after the November election&hellip;no matter who wins!!! </p>

<p>These mexicans are telling us that they&rsquo;re mexicans first. The mexican politican&rsquo;s argument is that the town is now 80% hispanic.  Someone should tell this moron that the town sits in the United States.  Then again, she wouldn&rsquo;t get it.   </p>
<p>Green card check! Aisle one! </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if the city council has the guts to pass the recommended ordinance that says no foreign flags will be flown on public property.  Stay tuned.  </p>

			<p>Welcome to the UNSA  &#8220;United Nations Social Agenda&#8221;.  USA has been gentrified and repopulated in less than 50 years.  No President or Congress has objected.  The laws to protect borders and illegal immigrants are not enforced.  The colonization of USA was in cooperation with US government.  The once &#8216;People&rsquo; of the government are now indentured servants to tax collectors to pay entitlements to &#8216;the new UN people&rsquo; who have no intentions of allegiance to US!  V</p>

			<p>It is amazing that some many people will get upset at the flying of the mexican flag, but ignore the presence of the invaders.  Just take the flag down, and everything will be fine.  The invaders will all turn White and speak English.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been upset when seeing a flag from Europe flying outside of a convention center or hall. That&rsquo;s because my friends and neighbors and family have roots in Europe. Americans have roots in Europe. Mexicans are invaders and colonizers. The Mexican flag flying in the United States is a mark of conquest. Non white Mexicans are not now or ever will be Americans.</p>

			<p>White, black and Hispanic elitisms, politicians and religious zealots are making the white American middle class fund their own demise via the bail out.  While our tax dollars are bailing out black and minority subprime mortgages the white middle class is crashing and is now slowly losing their homes via reversed mortgage loans so they can bear the simplest of necessities as they age in a country that will have a foreign population that will bring forth extreme hostile prejudice towards them.</p>

			<p>Let me get this straight:  we have protracted debates about the legality of flag burning, but no legislation against flying a foreign flag by a government entity on US soil?  Incredible.<br>
What&rsquo;s also amazing is that in the 1930s Cicero was a stronghold for Al Capone.  I wonder what Al&rsquo;s reaction would be to Cicero today? It would probably not be peaceful.</p>

<p>You forgot to add: &#8220;&hellip; because we are too lazy, corrupt or cowardly to fix our own &#8220;resource rich&#8221; homeland which we have turned into a Third-World sewer. And now, since we can no longer live with Our Own mess, we will take the easy route and just come suck your country dry. I mean, after all, once America looks Just like our Beloved Mexico (which we can no longer stand to live in), there is always Canada right?<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m starting to personally take a different slant on the flying of the Mexican flag, for whatever phony reason is given for it. My new attitude is that if the citizens are fine with it, in the places it happens, why should I sweat it? In fact, if Americans are so cool about it all, let the chips fall where they will. Each city will lay in the bed that they made. Right?</p>

			<p>How can one NOT agree with the poster Mestizo. In my opinion, he is 100 percent correct. How many Americans will re-elect the slobs that voted for the &#8220;bailout for the rich&#8221;? I&rsquo;ll bet 90 percent of them are re-elected. </p>

			<p>This incident is a recognition of the de facto situation. The US government has long since surrendered the frontiers and much of the heartland. So what else can we do but expect the invaders to recognize the reality and fly their flag?<br>

<p>Racial partition means that the borders of other race based nation states will extend deep into America. China&rsquo;s borders will extend several hundred miles deep into Amreica. The same for India&rsquo;s,Pakistans and Iran&rsquo;s borders.(over one million Iranians living in California at last count).</p>
<p>I want an ocean several thousans mile seperating America from China,India,Pakistan,Korea and Iran. Deport all Mexcans. </p>
<p>Ordinary Native Born White Americans know that something has gone teribly wrong. But they have yet to grasp the full magnitude of what is actually happenning.</p>
<p>There is going to be a very big problem with the post-1965 beneficiares of the 14th amendment. One can say with 100 percent certainty that they will vote in a race base way for more of their own kind. In other words, they will vote for a foriegn conquest of Native Born White America. For this reason, they should be stripped of their US citizenship. If this isn&rsquo;t done, Native Born White Americans will be without a home. In other words WE will-in a defacto manner -be stripped of our citizenship. </p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s speak plainly, shall we? When it is said that &#8220;we are a nation of immigrants, that is quite true. The character and quality of the original immigrants to this nation was of the highest stock on the planet. There can be no argument raised to counter this point. The people who came here from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries wanted to build an American future for themselves, not restore the chaos and disorder from whence they came. The important differences are culture and intelligence, and our new invaders possess a culture that is incompatible with a technologically advanced democratic nation, and they have little drive, desire, or intellectual capacity to add anything to the great nation that OUR forefather created and built. </p>
<p>Only two choices remain, either large parts of America will turn into Mexico, or we will kick the invaders out and limit future immigration strictly. If we choose the first, don&rsquo;t expect much in the way of spacewalking, missions to Mars, or great advancements in technology in the American future. We will be too busy paying to police incredibly dangerous streets, cleaning up the health hazards, and providing free medical care to people who have no concern for their own health or that of the community. Oh, and add a huge property tax burden to edumacate the leetle homies (in Spanish, Spanglish, and English). The best part will be when they have third-worldized their conquered patches of ground, we will see them on TV complaining that &#8220;America is treating us bad, man.

Could any flag, other than a Mexican flag be flown in your beloved home country?  We all know the answer to that one.  These ingrates forget why they came to MY great country.</p>

			<p>Just wait until either of the presidential candidates take over the White House. The Mexican flag will be flying along with Old Glory, or maybe instead of! God bless America. We need his blessings now more than ever in our nation&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diversity is a dismal failure and the only answer to the problem is racial partition, and it will certainly come about. The only question is whether it will be peaceful or violent.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right, and we should advocate the &#8220;peaceful&#8221; option.</p>
<p>The problem is diversity/multiculturalism itself. Like their parent philosophy, pluralism, they are an &#8220;agree to disagree&#8221; mechanism that results in no direction being taken.</p>

			<p>The time has come, people, for REAL Americans to do something about this situation.  The problem is, what can we do?  I have spoken to individuals who might be described as &#8220;White Nationalists&#8221; and the consensus is that each man should start by forming his own small group of like-minded individuals in his own neighborhood.  </p>
<p>As much as possible, practice racial separation, arm yourselves and spend your money with businesses that are owned by people who look like you.  As the situation in America worsens, persons of European descent will be forced to segregate themselves in order to survive.  </p>
<p>We are well beyond the point of &#8220;dialogue&#8221;.  Does anyone really believe we can have a &#8220;rational&#8221; discussion at this point? Listen to the rhetoric of non-whites, especially their politicians.  It should tell you that they are intent on taking what&rsquo;s yours and they don&rsquo;t care how you feel.  They are shouting it, in fact. </p>

			<p>To win this battle we need to clue a lot of our fellow Euro-Americans about the existence of American Renassaince. Two hours ago ago, I spoke to a group of patriotic Americans protesting-on main street in Huntington Long Island- the Mexican/Central American invasion of Huntington Long Island. I spoke to them about the importance of posting on American Renassaince. These patriotic Americans told me how they have been threatened with violence by Mexicans and Central American nationals for protesting the La Raza invasion from South of the border.</p>
<p>To build a movement to repel the invasion, we will need at least one million patriotic Euro-Americans to log onto this web-site every day. If this were to happen,the main stream media and the rest of the nation will take notice of us. We will be a force to reckon with. There is safety in numbers.</p>
<p>The greater the number of people who log on to American Renassaince, the greater the number of media appearances for Jared Taylor where he will encourage  a large population of European Americans to fight back.</p>
<p>I encourage every one here to find creative ways to make our fellow European Americans aware of the existence of American Renassaince.Do something.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You have to understand that Cicero is more than 80 percent Hispanic now,&rdquo; Punzo-Arias said.&#8221;   Hut it is still the United States of America.  No arguments.  If they do not like it, go back home.   We are British but now live in Spain and we fly the Spanish flag to celebrate such events as Spain winning the UEFA soccer cup, and Rafael Nadal winning at tennis.   In fact, the way that that Britain is going we sometimes, as other Brits here  also admit, are ashamed of admitting we are British. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;When it is said that &#8216;we are a nation of immigrants&rsquo;, that is quite true&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is one of the specious slogans that non-Whites, especially Hispanics, scream to claim that the Southwest (and USA) is rightfully theirs and that WE Whites are the invaders, not them; they are &#8216;returning&rsquo; to &#8216;claim&rsquo; what was stolen from them by Whites.</p>
<p>According to the American Heritage Dictionary, an immigrant is:</p>
<p>&ldquo;..A person who leaves one country to settle permanently in another&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A colonist is:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;An original settler or founder of a colony&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which country did the founders of the US immigrate to?</p>
<p>What do you think the US would be like now if it had been colonized by Spain, France or Portugal instead of England?</p>
<p>In California, ground zero of the third world invasion, and where Whites are now a minority in many places (and not welcome) this is what is being said with impunity:</p>
<p>Mario Obledo (former California secretary of health and welfare): &#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;We&rsquo;re going to take over all the political institutions of California. California is going to be a Hispanic state and anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like it should leave. If they [Anglos] don&rsquo;t like Mexicans, they ought to go back to Europe.&rsquo;..&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes, California, with its now mexican socialist legislature has become an anti-business, high-tax, welfare state (until the productive Whites are ethnically cleansed, that is).  </p>
<p>According to taxfoundation.org:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Estimated at 10.5% of income, Californians pay $5,028 per capita in state and local taxes. </p>
<p>California&rsquo;s Top Individual Income Tax Rate is the Highest in the Nation</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s individual income tax has the third-highest rate and one of the most highly progressive structures in the nation. </p>
<p>California&rsquo;s taxes on small businesses some of the most burdensome in the nation.</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s Corporate Income Tax Rate is the Highest in the West&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/15.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/15.html</a></p>
<p>What are the proposed solutions of our socialist governor?  More taxes, taxes, taxes in every form possible, and, as always, higher taxes on &#8216;the rich&rsquo; and more regulations on businesses.</p>
<p>I wonder who mestizo thinks is going to pay for all the section 8 housing, WIC, TANF, food stamps, education, MediCal and Medicare and other welfare/entitlement programs that the new colonists demand when the last White is ethnically cleansed?  Do they believe there will be a new golden age of economic prosperity and expansion with a low IQ population?</p>
<p><a href="/features/hispanics.html" rel="nofollow">/features/hispanics/</a></p>
<p>Next time someone spouts that tired cliché, ask him this:  How was this nation built and by whom?  How did this nation become the richest, freest, most prosperous technologically advanced nation EVER on the face of the earth?  Who built the infrastructure, the economy, the financial institutions here?</p>
<p>As Allan Wall writes on vdare.com:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Were the Jamestown settlers perfect? Of course not. But they started our country. They brought the English language, English common law, and English Protestant Christianity to American shores. They began our economic development and started our first legislative body and military units&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this from the London Sunday Telegraph:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the colony [Jamestown], whose settlement led directly to the birth of the world&rsquo;s most powerful nation&hellip;the first 107 settlers, brought with them&hellip;the traditions of English justice and common law that still underpin modern America&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.vdare.com/awall/070502_memo.htm</p>
<p>These wonderful things that the English COLONISTS, NOT IMMIGRANTS, brought with them from England, especially our system of laws and justice, are being mercilessly destroyed; the country founded by the English colonists is being ruined from within, on many fronts, as was the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Will we enter a new Dark Age such as the one that paralyzed Europe for 1000 years after the Roman Empire fell?  </p>
<p>When will the barbarians take the throne? They are certainly at the gates.</p>

When I was kid you could walk the streets of Cicero at night and not have to worry about being robbed or shot.  Yes, it was a tough neighborhood, but we all looked out for our own. And, if you didn&rsquo;t belong there, you had good reason to fear being there.  And we liked it that way.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Again, because of the dumbing down I have to again state the following: Mexican is a nationality, not a race! Are there any people left who know the difference?&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re correct in that Mexican is a nationality and not a race. However, you miss the point. Only about 10% of Mexicans are white. The rest are mixed race(mestizo) and consider themselves an entity seperate from whites or &#8220;gringos&#8221; as they sometimes call us. As a seperate people, they advance their own agenda at our expense.</p>

<p>I always have to laugh when these types tell whites to go back to europe. Mexicans  left mexico because it was not sucessful. Mexicans came to california because it was sucessful. California was sucessful because it was run by and made up of whites. Mexico was not sucessful because it was run by and made up of mexicans. If all the whites leave california, it will be run by and made up of mexicans and it will become the exact same thing the mexicans left behind.</p>

The Democratic party is our main culprit, more interested in minorities than in white people. So are Republicans, but not to that extent. We must&rsquo;nt vote democratic. That will force the party to move more to the right. They will then have to take notice of white people. We must not become a minority in our own country. Do not vote Democratic at any level!</p>

And while you&rsquo;re at it, illegal majority, why not dismantle the police dept of all these cities.  To hell with law!  You all know how to get fraudulent driver&rsquo;s licenses and register to vote and soon enough you&rsquo;ll outvote the US citizens in your area and have things your way.  Get those Mexican flags up and those tortillas cooking and to make it really like Mexico, also dismantle the city sewer system and just let the sludge flow into the fields to fertilize the crops.    </p>

<p>Unemployed WASP says: Another ignorant meztiso statement. Newsflash sancho, whites did all the dirty work in this country until some Republicans decided to give Mexicans an opportunity to better themselves in this country starting with the Bracero Program in 1942. Whites worked the fields, washed the cars, did the lawns, retail, delivered the papers, they did EVERYTHING. We took the Mexicans into this country, gave them citizenship, and they turned on us with a passion, proving that snakes must eventually shed their skin. The Dumbocrats used it to their political advantage. But like a Ponzi scheme it finally is crashing as the money runs out. </p>

			<p>  I know in some minds Cicero is best known for the drive-by machine gun shooting at the Hawthorne Hotel in an attempted &#8220;hit&#8221; on Al Capone. I don&rsquo;t defend Mr. Capone and his crime syndicate, but I note that the Cicero of his time was much safer and cleaner than the Hispanic dominated Cicero of today. I don&rsquo;t recall Mr. Capone demanding that Cicero be bilingual, fly the Italian flag or that Cicero make the Feast of San Gennaro a city holiday.</p>

2) you will be beheaded. Race doesn&rsquo;t matter to them. Their Supreme goal is to rule the World (their own words). The Mexicans will leave rather than fight, so that leaves the rest of us to stave off this Insurrection or do nothing &amp; let it happen. Muslims are already banding together to make sure Obama is elected President. They see him as an friend if Islam. Right now almost 100 Million Americans are Armed &amp; will not let this happen. If Obama wins, he will try to repeal the Second Amendment &amp; will disarm US Citizens. Muslims preach the Religion of Peace, don&rsquo;t believe it. Don&rsquo;t take my word for it. Research it &amp; tell others to also. We are at war with Islam, weather you believe it or not. This is one war we must win or face Annihilation. This war has been going on (Muslims against the World) for over 30 years. There have been over 11,000 attacks worldwide in that time period. Research it! 9/11 was only one small incident, with more to come. </p>

<p>Not long ago the few used car lots residing down a certain stretch of a well known road in an upscale part of Houston all flew Mexican flags to attract Mexican customers.  I called each one of them from a pay phone and simply told them that it was illegal to fly a foreign flag over American soil unless they were a foreign embassy.  I stated that if they didn&rsquo;t remove those Mexican flags post haste they would be put out of business.  Within a week or two every one of them complied.</p>

Americans, especially at an economically-depressed time like this, will soon realize that their needs must come first.<br>
Towns, cities, states&hellip;  Heck!  The whole country is going bankrupt; so who&rsquo;s going to eat?  American citizens or illegal ALIENS?  </p>
<p>Get real, Mestizo&hellip;  Clearly, your reckless and carefree days of free loading will soon dry up, and you&rsquo;ll be forced to do the right thing and return to your beloved Motherland.</p>

			<p>I have to concur with those who suggested it will take bloodshed (like a civil war) to drive the invaders back. Perhaps when &#8220;critical mass&#8221; is reached, an explosion will occur. People are getting fed up and sick and tired of the p.c. garbage they&rsquo;re being forcefed by the politicians about the &#8220;good&#8221; of diversity.</p>

			<p>Gayle Sollenberger, Mexican flags on car antennas? I thought this only happened in Aztlan, I mean California.</p>

			<p>Plywood signs on the freeway that say amren.com.  I put them over exising campaign posters.  they don&rsquo;t last more than a day or two, but tens of thousands see each one when I put them up.</p>

			<p>Al Capone was light years more ethical than even the best of the illegal aliens in Cicero today.  As depicted in GoodFellas, the mob exists as a police force for low level, who can&rsquo;t go the real police when they are robbed, hijacked, or assaulted.  An ordinary citizen was 100 percent safe from Capone; he only killed other mobsters or their associates.  Moreover, Capone exploited an economic nitch by supplying booze to consumers during an ill-concieved governmental attempt to criminalize the production of alcohol.   I would live in a town full of Capones before I would live in a town that was 80 percent illegals.</p>

			<p>Mexican Americans are surely delighted that their numbers are rapidly increasing in the U.S. and our country is becoming Mexicanized.  African Americans are surely delighted that whites cannot criticize any of their bad behavior   &mdash;   call them &#8220;racists&#8221; and all dialogue ends.  Liberal whites are surely delighted to hand our country over to any and all Third World newcomers, because &#8220;we are all the same.&#8221;  And we whites, who want a European inspired country for our families and to be left alone, are criticized as &#8220;racists&#8221; for wanting this, even by our own ignorant people.</p>
<p>I saw a video on Fox News where a man was speaking with concern that our country&rsquo;s rapid population growth is primarily from the illegal Mexican invasion, so we must secure our borders.  The female interviewer was painting him as a racist, saying that she loves everyone and was he implying brown people are not welcome?  </p>
<p>Sadly I think it is over for European Americans in this country.  In about six to eight years Mexico&rsquo;s oil fields will be dry and that means millions more will come here looking for work and social services.  We will be overwhelmed by the stampede and become a banana republic in short order.  </p>
<p>Only whites can make a European-style, First World country, and that&rsquo;s a fact.  Our borders should have been protected years ago.</p>

			<p>When I would attend a junior high school dance the boys would all be on one side of the gym and the girls the other.  Noone danced until one brave young lad would cross the floor and ask a young lady for a dance.  This would embolden the other frady cats to follow suit.  </p>
<p>I predict the same thing will happen when American males decide it is time to obliterate Hispanics infesting this nation.  It only takes one to start the ball rolling and once it starts rolling nothing that governmet does will be able to stop it&hellip;    </p>
