<h1>Loudoun and Prince William&rsquo;s Immigrant Populations Shrinking</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Jacks, Loudon Times (Loudon County, Virginia), September 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Northern Virginia counties that took highly publicized stances against illegal immigration saw their number of foreign-born residents decline last year, while one of their neighbors saw its immigrant population go up.</p>
<p>In 2007, the immigrant population dropped about 1 percent in Loudoun County and 6 percent in Prince William County, according to the Census Bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey 2007, which was released Sept. 23.</p>
<p>However, in Fairfax County, where leaders have been less willing to place restrictions on illegal immigration, the foreign-born population went up 7 percent last year. In addition, Fairfax saw its number of residents who are not U.S. citizens &mdash; which includes legal immigrants &mdash; increase 8 percent, while Prince William&rsquo;s noncitizen population dropped 4 percent and Loudoun&rsquo;s remained relatively unchanged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Grabbing most the headlines has been Prince William and the aggressive stance its leaders have taken against illegal immigration. However, some Loudoun leaders were just as vocal in 2007 about making the county less hospitable to people in the country illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aside from stepping up their enforcement of illegal boarding houses, leaders in Fairfax have been less inclined to propose such extreme measures.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I can just tell you Fairfax County is not going to go the route of some of our neighbors,&#8221; Fairfax&rsquo;s Board of Supervisors Chairman Gerry Connolly (D-at large) told the Washington Post last year on illegal immigration. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not going to demagogue.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
Another knucklehead who thinks his job is to represent the interests of illegal invaders. And it&rsquo;s an absolute height of hypocrisy for this Democrat to claim they are not going to &#8220;demagogue&#8221; the issue of illegal aliens. It&rsquo;s all they do, but we&rsquo;ll see if the average REAL citizen Fairfax agrees with this knucklehead.</p>

			<p>There are a couple Utube video postings on this issue.  In one, an ivory tower professor of economics speaks about how the local economy suffer because of racism.  He thinks economic expansion can be endless especially if Multiculturalism is served.  I have gotten into several heated exchages with pro-alien posters through one of them.  But hooray for the White natives!</p>

			<p>Wait until the gangs get in there (Fairfax County) and start tearing it up. They&rsquo;ll come around. The problem is that its usually too late by that time.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And it&rsquo;s an absolute height of hypocrisy for this Democrat to claim they are not going to &ldquo;demagogue&rdquo; the issue of illegal aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
So bringing up the issue of illegal aliens is &#8220;demagoguing&#8221;?<br>
(After all, they&rsquo;re doing something illegal, aren&rsquo;t they?  Or excuse me for pointing that out.)</p>
<p>A governmental official who thinks enforcing the law is demagoguery?  Maybe it&rsquo;s time to dump that official!<br>

			<p>Ironically Prince George County, dominated by middle class blacks, does nothing to discourage the growing Hispanic population in the north side of the county near the U of Maryland.  These immigrants, legal and illegal, cause significant costs to the county for extra language and special education tutoring in the schools. Moreover, the crime ridden county now has an addtional problem as MS13 and other Salvadoran gangs take over the streets of the northeast section of the county stretching from the DC line to the Capital Beltway.  </p>
<p>Yet Blacks remain mute as jobs and public resources shift to the growing Hispanic population which on the whole has no desire to assimilate into either County or American activities or customs.  The main effort of Hispanics is to take over the blue collar jobs of the County.  Given the mediocre performance fo most blacks in the County schools(2nd worst in MD next to the atrocious Baltimore public schools), there will be thousands of barely literate black &#8220;graduates&#8221; of PG County public schools entering the workforce.  </p>
<p>The Federal Gvt and its contractors, the traditional employers of middle class blacks in the DC area, can&rsquo;t waive even under affirmative action the minimum requirements for white collar jobs for these illiterates.  Moreover, the young black grads don&rsquo;t want to work in construction, maintenance or hotel upkeep jobs, so the Hispanics will take those jobs. </p>
<p>And the blacks will blame whites, even though the Council and County Executive of PG County are all part of the local black political machine.  But the machine unlike other ethnic machines in other cities in the past will do nothing to prevent largely illegal immigrants from stealing jobs from black people, largely because black people don&rsquo;t want jobs that require manual or tedious labor.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to demagogue.&rdquo;<br>
First and foremost, the words is a noun, meaning a political leader who seeks support by appealing to popular desires and prejudices. What comes out out this statement is firstly, he does  not speak English and secondly, he does not give a damn what the people want and thirdly, he is no democrat. Democracy is a form of government that respects the will of the governed and acts in accordance with it.</p>

			<p>I live in Fairfax County. The article is spot on. Whites are at the point of being majority minority status due to the influx of Hispanics, Koreans, Indians, Pakistanis, etc. The political correctness is overwhelming, trust me. </p>

			<p>Here is what you do&hellip;off the 495 Beltway take the New Hampshire <br>
Ave exit and drive South 5 miles. In that stretch on any given workday morning you will see 15,000 illegal aliens standing on <br>
street corners. After about 10am the job search is over and they spend the days hanging out on the corners, barbequing chicken on the public sidewalks, drinking and getting in fights.<br>
This goes on into the night then begins again the next day.<br>
If ICE showed up they could arrest 10,000 illegals in  the parking lot of Langley Park &#8220;Crossroads&#8221; shopping center (intersection New Hampshire and Rte. 410 but ICE never does.<br>
This is WITHIN SIGHT OF THE CAPITAL DOME. You gotta laugh when they brag about ICE raid in rural Mississippi that picks up a &#8220;record&#8221; 500 illegals.</p>

			<p>Connolly is running for Congress this time around.  <br>
 <br>
If he wins he&rsquo;ll be replacing a &#8220;moderate&#8221; republican, Davis, who at least started to see the illegal issue as important.</p>
<p>Vote Fimian!</p>

			<p>A personal friend who is a psychometrist (in her case, she measures IQs for a living) once told me that Fairfax county had the highest average IQ score in the entire country. Wonder how long that&rsquo;ll last now. Sometimes &mdash; thankfully, not all the time &mdash; high-IQ people have a bit much to chew with &hellip; and their minds end up working at cross-purposes to their own well-being: we might call this being a liberal-minded intellectual. Folks of average intelligence must look at things more pragmatically. I just worry that the Fairfax 150-Watt bulbs don&rsquo;t start flickering from all the 40-Watts added to the circuit. Zap!</p>
