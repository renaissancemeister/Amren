<h1>Study: 22% of 2007 Felonies Caused by Illegals</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KFYI (Phoenix), October 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new study from the Maricopa County Attorney is showing that illegal immigrants are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study concluded that nine percent of Arizona&rsquo;s population is in the country illegally, yet nearly 22 percent of felonies sentenced in Maricopa County are committed by illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Arizona taxpayers shell out $114 million annually to cover the cost of incarcerating them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;A new study from the Maricopa County Attorney is showing that illegal immigrants are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Determined to try to get people to believe his lies, Geraldo Rivera on Bill O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s show announced that illegals commit crimes at a rate that is less than the general population.</p>
<p>Michelle Malkin was opposite him on a debate about illegals, quoting supportable facts and figures, and Rivera went just about ballistic, because he couldn&rsquo;t stand hearing the truth, and exclaimed to Michelle that he&rsquo;d like to spit in her face.</p>
<p>So here it is again.  A left wing nut case reacts with words and conduct that would get anyone else thrown off the air, and he isn&rsquo;t made to account for such outrageous words and conduct.</p>
<p>Turn the situation around, and a conservative saying the same thing to a leftist radical would result in headlines in the yellow journalistic rag, The New York Times, and he&rsquo;d never get to appear again on Fox.</p>

			<p>Several years ago I watched a TV news story about the stray dog problem of a small Southern county.  Like almost every other county in the USA, stray dogs were collected and if the owner could not be found or no one stepped forward to adopt the animal, it was euthanized. The issue which shocked everyone was that in this particular county the dogs were dispatched with a bullet to the back of the head.  The county simply couldn&rsquo;t afford the gas chambers or drugs more affluent jurisdictions used.  People were appalled and shocked.  Why, and what does that have to do with the topic at hand?  Modern man is weak and squeamish.  A bullet is probably faster than an injection or gas, but is messy.  Modern man doesn&rsquo;t like to see messy things.  Illegals who break in to our country and commit violent crimes should not be incarcerated.  They should be shot.  Non violent felons should be sentenced to slave labor until there debt is repaid and then repatriated to their native slum, never to return to the USA under pain of death.  Employers of illegals should be imprisoned.  But none of this will ever happen.  We are too weak.  We will lose our country.</p>

			<p>What level of idiot does it take to commit crimes in Maricopa County? Oh Yeah! I like living in tents in 110+ degrees, Sun baked sand and rock for 200 miles, pink underwear and baloney! Snakes and scorpions move to better environs. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but I can&rsquo;t buy the &#8216;poor/desperate/downtrodden&rsquo; illegal story. If you can walk the border, you can sure as H*LL walk out of Maricopa before committing a felony!</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the county that houses prisoners in tents? And it costs them $114m?  That&rsquo;s a lot of tents.</p>

<p>Only 9percent?</p>

			<p>I grew up on a different planet. One where dad worked and mother stayed home with the kids. Public schools were a place of learning. The family went to church on Sunday and campouts on Friday nights. Doors stayed open at night and all the neighbors got along. Davey Crocket hats and the Lone Ranger on Saturday morning. Holidays were warm family times.</p>
<p>Today I live in gangland. The ghetto bird goes day and night over ahead. It&rsquo;s a police state. Gangs crip and blood and Southside 13 all over the pavements and you can&rsquo;t even walk to the store for a sandwhich without the risk of confrontation with one of these players or some tweaker icehead. All the old social mores are gone. The schools have a 50% dropout rate here feeding over 200,000 gang members in this city (that doesn&rsquo;t count their many more associates). Los Angeles IS Gotham city but there is no Batman.</p>
<p>Forunately we have a mayorial candidate finally that will change things if elected. His name is Walter Moore. Go to his website and drop him an encouraging message. Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t have the numbers any longer to get him in office. Meaning Gotham City will remain Gotham City. I expect riots when the money runs out here in the near future. They are kind of intense to be truthful.</p>

			<p>Illegals commit ONLY 22% of the felonies? Then I presume Mexican-Americans must commit 58% of the remainder. Anyone other an an outright fool like Geraldo Rivera is only too aware that crime and immigration are virtually inseparable. Given the obvious reality illegal immigrants are often penniless and hardly above subsidizing their journey with shoplifting, thefts of opportunity, car-break-ins, nor forgetting the occasional mugging when odds are in their favor.</p>

			<p>Perhaps the sheriff there should make the chain gangs, tents and food even less pleasant, but I can&rsquo;t imagine how.  I suspect what we are seeing here is that the illegal aliens simply don&rsquo;t care that they are already committing a crime by crossing the border, and when they decide to commit an additional felony in Maricopa County (!), the possibility of getting caught never enters their heads.  If they don&rsquo;t imagine they will be caught, the county jail&rsquo;s conditions probably aren&rsquo;t much of a deterrent - the first time.  I&rsquo;ll bet nobody who has been there is in a big hurry to go back, however.</p>

			<p>Flamethrower: I believe that once enough whites have themselves become &#8220;messy&#8221; from the weapons of minority gang bangers whites will stop being &#8220;weak and squeamish&#8221; about splattering the brains, blood and guts of our enemies.  </p>
<p>As any combat vet will tell you one becomes acclimated to killing and gore rather quickly when placed in harm&rsquo;s way.  Today there is nowhere white Americans can go where we aren&rsquo;t in harm&rsquo;s way from the hoards of minority criminal bottom feeders flooding our communities&hellip;    <br>

<p>You have it right on.  The best soldiers in the world in Vietnam were Joe Sixpacks.  I&rsquo;ve seen those who started out looking like librarian types turn out to be some of the fiercest warriors on planet earth. It was amazing to observe the transformation of relatively pampered whites into highly efficient fighting men.</p>
<p>Looking around us today we see whites who appear to be subdued and intimidated by the PC system in play right now, but if we are unfortunate enough to tip over the edge due to our falling economy and the malcontents begin fighting us, observe for yourselves the utter phenomenon of heroes in the making who were everyday taxpayers, who wanted to go along in order to get along, turn into the most efficient fighting machines in the world.</p>
<p>We received a slight glimpse of how many courageous whites we have in this country when the militias were formed a few years ago.  Nobody thought such people were in our population.  But they were here and they were ready to fight.  There are millions more here just like them right now.</p>
<p>Hard times make hard people, and the change comes about almost overnight.<br>
