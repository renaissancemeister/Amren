<h1><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=79293">Will Black Voters Be Powder Keg?</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>World Net Daily, October 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama campaign is accusing Republicans of trying to disenfranchise black voters in Detroit and other cities by using home foreclosure lists to turn them away from polls on Election Day.</p>
<p>The charges were initially raised by Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters of the Congressional Black Caucus, prompting Obama and the Democratic National Committee to sue the Michigan GOP.</p>
<p>The federal suit, which campaign lawyers acknowledge is based solely on unconfirmed reports and rumors, also alleges that Ohio Republicans and the Republican National Committee also have schemed to challenge voters who have lost their homes in the battleground state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last month, Waters, D-Watts &mdash; who fanned the flames of the deadly Rodney King riots in Los Angeles, earning her the nickname &#8220;Kerosene Maxine&#8221; &mdash; demanded the FBI investigate the rumors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Convinced an actual conspiracy is under way, Waters said, &#8220;It&rsquo;s a violation of the Voting Rights Act, and we shouldn&rsquo;t linger with this.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>James Carville and other Democrat activists have already hinted at similar riots breaking out in heavily black cities in the event Obama, the first African-American presidential nominee, loses the election.</p>
<p>Senior NAACP official Hilary Shelton said blacks would get angry if they felt disenfranchised because of voting irregularities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Shelton said police should prepare to control crowds, she warned against too big a police presence near polls, which she said could intimidate first-time minority voters.</p>
<p>In anticipation of possible unrest, police in Detroit, Chicago, Oakland and Philadelphia are beefing up their ranks for Election Day. Police based the need for enhanced patrols in part on the Internet rumors alleging disenfranchisement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But election officials there say registered voters who left their foreclosed home for a different address in the same precinct are still eligible to vote. And officials deny the distribution of any foreclosure lists.</p>

<p>Whether Obama wins or loses, the post election riots might well totally finish off Detroit.</p>

			<p>I still cannot believe that people, especially liberals who are going to blindly vote for Obama, are willing to do so, not knowing the slightest thing about his background. All the unanswered questions,even about the legitamacy of his birth certificate, which he to this day has not mad available. Even the Los Angeles Times Newspaper, that famous dispensor of TRUTH, is hiding a tape that could nail him  politically.</p>

<p>Va. NAACP Sues Governor Over Election Readiness </p>
<p>Monday, October 27, 2008 6:30 PM</p>
<p>RICHMOND, Va.  &mdash;  The Virginia NAACP sued Gov. Tim Kaine on Monday, arguing that the state failed to prepare for an unprecedented turnout of voters in next week&rsquo;s presidential election. </p>
<p><br/>
The complaint, filed late Monday in U.S. District Court in Richmond, alleges that with record increases in voter registration, the state failed to provide enough polling places. </p>
<p><br/>
It asks the court to put the federal government in charge of the election in Virginia, to reallocate voting machines to precincts most likely to have long waiting lines and to keep polls open for an additional two hours. <br/>

			<p> Don&rsquo;t know about Michigan, but I&rsquo;m a polling place worker in Indiana, and the address on the voter&rsquo;s (state-required) government-issued ID in our state doesn&rsquo;t have to match the one they put down when signing the voter&rsquo;s register. So the argument about the &#8220;foreclosed houses&#8221; would be nonsense in Indiana. Just more black paranoia.</p>
<p> So they want the police presence to not be too obvious on election day, for fear of &#8220;intimidating first-time minority voters&#8221;? If you are law-abiding, why would you be &#8220;intimidated&#8221; by the sight of police?</p>

			<p>&#8220;James Carville and other Democrat activists have already hinted at similar riots breaking out in heavily black cities in the event Obama, the first African-American presidential nominee, loses the election.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, we have another story focused on the potential for unrestrained and animalistic violence on the part of blacks who are going to feel cheated, if &#8220;saint&#8221; BO loses this election or they think they have been &#8220;disenfranchised&#8221; in great numbers. Never mind that probably about 75% or greater of the adult black population has no clear idea of what the word &#8220;disenfranchised&#8221; really means, it is an educated sounding multi-syllable word that will give them something to chant while they go on their rampages. Seriously, even if Comrade BO wins, they are likely to do the same anyway (as many here, myself included, have predicted they will ) in their sense of jubilant &#8220;triumph&#8221; over &#8220;whiety.&#8221; However, even in this scenario of joyous black mayhem, the potential is there for an undercurrent of falsely held grievance by some blacks who feel they were &#8220;cheated&#8221; and  &#8220;disenfranchised&#8221; out of their &#8220;right&#8221; to participate in this so-called transitional historic event; never mind that they are not registered to vote, nor ever have been, they will simply take this assumed indicator of &#8220;racist oppression&#8221; and run with it.</p>
<p>Sounds farfetched?</p>
<p>Nope, not if you think about the typical &#8220;oppressed&#8221; mindset of the vast majority of them; reality has a way of mutating for them into a more &#8220;lucid objectivity,&#8221; when some highly subjective but &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; sounding mantra with a key buzzword, is mindlessly repeated without pause until transcendence into a spiritual and moral &#8220;superiority&#8221; is achieved by them. Hence, the equally &#8220;rational&#8221; corresponding formation of a grinding sense of outrage at whites for having debased them through &#8220;discrimination,&#8221; or here &#8220;disenfranchisement,&#8221; that allows them to do anything they please to heal the wounds to their precious &#8220;minds&#8221; and &#8220;souls&#8221; in return. </p>
<p>Remember: &#8220;No justice, no peace&#8221;?</p>
<p>How about: &#8216;I be disenfranchised because of whiety&rsquo;s lies, now they all has to dies&rsquo;?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>Black people are always a powder keg in our midst.  For election night, all local National Guard units should be on alert.  And our urban police forces should be in constant readiness for organized mischief as well as the predictable street crime that is part and parcel of the &#8220;African-American culture.&#8221;       </p>

****************************<br/>
Let me get this. They are bringing a federal lawsuit against the MIchigan GOP because of a RUMOR that MAYBE they are THINKING of doing something unethical???? Since when is that any more ethical than the percieved possible injustice of the GOP?<br/>
In any case Maxine Waters is either a nut job or senile, or both and ought to be locked in a padded room along with Hillary Sheldon and anyone else who takes her garbage seriously.  </p>

			<p>Do blacks really need an excuse to riot? Should a potential riot be an excuse as to how to determine a verdict, or perhaps sway an election? Viewing news videos from past riots always shows blacks destroying property and looting. But I suppose every video from every news network is just another example of racial profiling. It&rsquo;s my belief that the rioting could occur regardless of who wins the presidentiaL election. If Obama loses, blacks can express their frustration/anger/disappointment in their usual animalistic way. But if Obama wins, a celebration could easily get out of hand as well, with a &#8216;free reign&rsquo; mentality. As distorted as the black thought process is, what little there is, considering their past behaviors, they will have ample excuses to carry on as they always have.          </p>

			<p>The excuse-making has already begun in case Obama loses. It will all be chalked up to &#8220;voter intimidation&#8221; if the messiah doesn&rsquo;t win and of course will be used as a justification to riot. Plus, by perpetuating this charade of &#8220;disenfranchisement&#8221; Maxine Waters and the race-hustlers are hoping the people in charge of watching the vote will back off and be less vigilante thus allowing for voter fraud to take place. Remember this woman Waters is a communist, she doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about democracy or the democratic process. Any trick that can be used to skew the outcome will be used.</p>

			<p>If you have been following the mainstream media&rsquo;s coverage of all this, they have been setting the stage for Blacks to scream &#8220;we been done wrong&#8221; in the unlikely event McCain actually pulls this out. Disregarding the ACORNS and such, the media instead continues to investigate the largely baseless assertions of &#8220;disenfranchisement&#8221; and the like. </p>
<p>Basically, the media already has a contingency plan set-up to counter a McCain win with all manner of accusations, and cries of foul-play, almost certain to whip the Black &#8220;community&#8221; into a frenzy&hellip;figuratively, if not literally. It is a dangerous game they are playing and I cannot for a minute believe they don&rsquo;t know it! </p>

			<p>The blacks comprised about 13-14% of this country&rsquo;s population but yet are the biggest trouble makers of all the other racial groups put together.  Now, this country is so deluded and self destructive that it will even want a radical black man to be it&rsquo;s president. </p>

			<p>Well, I done did it. Took my permanent absentee ballot over to the Registrar of Voters and dropped it off before I could change my mind about anything.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t know how ambivalent I was about filling in the bubble for Obama. I resent the heck out of the implication that I&rsquo;m somehow wimping out or worried about black rioting. Sarah Palin, however, was the last nail in the McCain campaign&rsquo;s coffin.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll say the same thing that I say every time one of these stories about the angry mobs comes out.  You had better not riot near my house.  You people can burn down your own neighborhoods any day now and it will only be an improvement.  The roach infested hovels that you and your ilk call home could use some remodeling anyway.  Hey, if you burn the neighborhoods completely down, I might just buy up the land that you were formerly renting on and build a gated community.  Wouldn&rsquo;t even have to pay for demo.  </p>
<p>So go ahead and make your poor &#8220;disenfranchised&#8221; neighbors homeless.  I&rsquo;ll see if I can profit from your stupidity and lack of self control.</p>

			<p>generalquagmyer, it&rsquo;s called &#8220;cutting off your nose to spite your face&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s one thing to refuse to vote for a bad candidate on principle, but where&rsquo;s the principle involved in voting for a worse one?</p>
<p>I see very bad things in America&rsquo;s future. I say this with no glee at all; I have progeny in America who will suffer along with you.  For that matter, we&rsquo;re all going to suffer. When it happens, just remember: you asked for it.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t count on law enforcement nor the Military to protect you and yours. Stock up on ammo now.<br/>
I think that more Whites than ever will now vote for Obama because they&rsquo;ve been sufficiently intimidated. This is nothing more than extortion. <br/>
If Obama loses due to any Republican shenanigans, we are in for a war which we will eventually win but it&rsquo;ll be a Phyrric victory at best. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you believe it, more likely they are preparing to shoot armed groups of whites defending their lives, family and property against gangs of looting, robbing, raping and burning blacks. I have personally seen this conduct before, having lived in Watts and Compton during said riots. Those cities BTW weren&rsquo;t always like that, only when blacks became the majority did it turn that way.</p>

			<p>Blacks have been elevated to a protected criminal class in this country.  They take it as their due to riot, burn, loot and murder without legitimate grievance or reason, and incredibly a large number of whites readily acknowledge and encourage this &#8220;right.&#8221;</p>
<p>James Carville&rsquo;s statement that blacks would riot from coast to coast if Obama loses was less a prediction than it was an outright incitement, one calculated to both incite blacks to an orgy of destruction and frighten whites into voting for &#8220;The One.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not completely true. Weirdos and eccentrics can sometimes garner a bit of respect or sympathy. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always preferred to think of race-realism as a forward looking movement. At least one day I think the world will face up to the real reality of racism against whites. While that day may indeed never come to pass, I do think the day will come, at least in North America, when there will at least be preservation/reservation.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;having lived in Watts and Compton during said riots. Those cities BTW weren&rsquo;t always like that, only when blacks became the majority did it turn that way&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Skip at 6:53 AM on October 29</p>
<p>Those two cities, while still unspeakable hell-holes, are no longer black majority due to government-backed, hispanic-led ethnic cleansing. As 11:58 PM put so brilliantly: &#8220;&hellip;You people can burn down your own neighborhoods any day now and it will only be an improvement. The roach infested hovels that you and your ilk call home could use some remodeling anyway&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p><br/>
Compton:  Hispanic/Latino:  67.1%, Black:  29.7% <br/>
Watts:    Hispanic/Latino:  63%,  Black:  35.5%</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t think hispanics won&rsquo;t riot  &mdash;  they need little reason to smash windows, set fires, create mayhem to get what they believe is &#8216;their fair share&rsquo; from evil Whites  &mdash;  backed up by a police hating, race-centric mayor who told them (at an illegal alien rally) &#8216;We clean YOUR toilets.&rsquo; (&#8216;Your&rsquo;, of course, is in reference to Whites).</p>
<p>Remember:  LA is over-run with violent, heavily armed, MOBILE illegal alien mexican drugs gangs that will use any opportunity to create havoc. There are reports here that the drug gangs are making inroads into entire towns  &mdash;  using their vast amounts of drug money to &#8216;buy up&rsquo; political offices and place their members on police forces, the higher the rank the better (using AA, of course). </p>
<p>I have a strong feeling that after the riots are over, perceived rage at White suppression will still be blamed and huge FEMA-type payments will be demanded to pay for the wreckage (money that will disappear as it did after Hurricaine Katrina).</p>

			<p>One of the latest rumors in the black community is that all the early votes cast last week will be thrown away by evil whites working for McCain.</p>
<p>The Florida and Georgia blacks are spreading this rumor.  Probably they will demand to vote again on Nov 5th just to make sure their votes are counted.</p>

			<p> Let&rsquo;s remember, Detroit is overwhelmingly Black and controlled by Black politicians. So any disenfranchisment will be a function of local government incompetence just as pre-Katrina New Orleans.<br/>
 In addition, the likes of Maxine Waters could care less about what happens to Blacks who are induced to riot by her own actions and statements. She&rsquo;ll be safely distant when shots are fired and Blacks kill Blacks as happened during the Rodney King riots.<br/>
 What is being overlooked is that there will most likely be a large number of young whites joining the riots based on the make up of Obama&rsquo;s rallies. Too many have bought into him being the &#8220;ONE&#8221;. &#8220;Give me a child for six years and I&rsquo;ll give you a Communist for Life&#8221;, V.I. Lenin. <br/>
 Marxists demand total gun control because an armed citizenry is dangerous to them since they are capable of self-defense.</p>

			<p>The blacks comprised about 13-14% of this country&rsquo;s population but yet are the biggest trouble makers of all the other racial groups put together. Now, this country is so deluded and self destructive that it will even want a radical black man to be it&rsquo;s president. </p>
<p>Why does this low % figure relative to the black population keep getting printed?? I am sure it is more like 40% of the people in America are black now. Travel around and look!! everywhere you look, hordes of black loafers are out, especially after the sun goes down. If the figure was truly 15% we would have no worry of a black being elected, not even with the inclusion of pandering white dumb asses. Weapons are our friends, get them while we can.</p>

			<p>The charges were initially raised by Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters of the Congressional Black Caucus, prompting Obama and the Democratic National Committee to sue the Michigan GOP.</p>
<p>Who else, but the grand dragon of Black Fascism would come up with more disillusion black racist claims. Your race is the race of Gods and Goddesses; the only thing that you were disenfranchised from was intelligence and morality.<br/>
The Day of Judgment is coming Maxine when we will not be pushed any longer by low life black Fascists like you, you worthless fool.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Obama campaign is accusing Republicans of trying to disenfranchise black voters in Detroit and other cities by using home foreclosure lists to turn them away from polls on Election Day.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is just another propaganda invention to solidify the Obama via hate mongering. </p>

<p>Yes, Rabblerouser, weirdos and eccentrics can sometimes garner a bit of sympathy &hellip; among the intelligent, who have, by their very natures, more empathy! </p>
<p>Sad to say, however, that lower IQ peoples have LESS understanding and empathy! That is the natural law, in this world and in the other, eldritch worlds!</p>
<p>That is why there is so little true individualism among Blacks.<br/>
True self-realization and self-actualization among Blacks is as rare as a vote for McCain!</p>
<p>A strange thing to say for a people who, by all accepted psychological tests, score much higher on self-esteem than Whites!</p>
<p>Perhaps the lower IQ peoples have high self-esteem because their IQ is too low for them to know that there are many things they do not know?  Self-realization is a battle that must be fought, and fought hard. It takes perseverance and insight, and the end result is usually a placid humility, not ignorant arrogance, and a knowledge that there are worlds beyond this one. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look for these people to set up reservations for us  &mdash;  more likely it will be a repeat of the South African slaughter-at-random.  They do not care enough, or have enough concern,  to set up reservations.</p>
<p>No respect, no reservations!</p>
<p>All the best, Rabblerouser!</p>
