				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Margaret Gibbons, Times Herald (Norristown, Pennsylvania), October 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Members of Montgomery County&rsquo;s [Pennsylvania] black community Thursday called on the county commissioners to hire and promote more blacks to leadership positions in county government and to be more sensitive to allegations of racial discrimination within county government.</p>
<p>The focal point of their criticism was District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman&rsquo;s firing last August of Reginald A. Roberts, a former Norristown police officer and a nine-year veteran of the county detective bureau and the county&rsquo;s lone black county detective, although the bureau is headed by Chief Oscar Vance Jr., who also is black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are collectively concerned with the apparent lack of sensitivity or concern by the county detectives and the district attorney&rsquo;s office for fairness in the minority community,&#8221; said John Milligan, a member of the executive committee of the Norristown chapter of the NAACP.</p>
<p>In addition to his concern about the handling of the Roberts situation, Milligan said he also was concerned that the lack of blacks as county detectives that has &#8220;resulted in a white-faced department policing the minority community,&#8221; causing a polarizing effect on the minority community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ambler NAACP President Evelyn Warner expanded on the NAACP&rsquo;s more general concerns, noting that the county has had few blacks in positions of authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lingering problem of racism in the county,&#8221; said Warner, pointing out that there has been only one black judge since the county was founded in 1784 and none currently. &#8220;We do not get respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Vance may be the only black detective, Ferman said her office has a &#8220;number of&#8221; Hispanic detectives.</p>
<p>In addition, Ferman said, she and members of her staff meet often with minority clergy and send minority staff members to schools to serve as positive role models.</p>

<p>As if the black &#8220;diversity&#8221; apologists ever cared one flip about other minorities.  Remember that, in the US, &#8220;diverse&#8221; and &#8220;multicultural&#8221; means more blacks&hellip;period.</p>

			<p>What? Hasn&rsquo;t the police employment tests been purged of anything measuring literacy and cognitive skills (which of course would make it racist)? No consent degree like those atrocities agreed to elsewhere that dumb down the testing so much that enough black applicants can pass? Well no wonder the NAACP is unhappy.</p>

			<p>From the Norristown newspaper:</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary basis for his (Roberts) termination were actions that jeopardized the safety and security of people in this office and in the law enforcement community.  They made his continued employment with the county impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>This African was fired because he compromised the lives of his fellow officers.  More than likely, he commumicated within the &#8216;black community&rsquo; with an unsavory type who had a rap sheet longer than Luther&rsquo;s 95 Theses.  He shouldn&rsquo;t just be fired; he should be locked up.<br/>

<p>This is what it&rsquo;s come down to. The NAACP now has to beg people to take their charges seriously because they&rsquo;ve cried wolf too many times and exaggerated too many alleged &#8216;racial&rsquo; incidents.</p>
<p>What happens to the NAACP their goal of eliminating racism is achieved?<br/>

			<p>Another reason why I&rsquo;d only be a one term county supervisor in that burg.  I would do the following:</p>
<p>The perpetually grieving (see also, whining) NAACP would be confronted with their newest, and again, baseless complaint by the lowest level bureaucrat in the county government.  They would be told that there are high standards, and they won&rsquo;t be lowered for anyone, regardless of race.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d then have my low-end mouthpiece to tell them to find candidates for the sheriff&rsquo;s department who can make the standards set forth, and then have them apply.</p>
<p>My representative would point out to the professional black whiners that when black kids in school become civilized and start achieving, they can be considered as candidates for the department.  I would also have my rep say that the new black hires would not be promoted due to their race, and would have to take their place in the seniority line. Until then, bruthas, take a hike. Then I&rsquo;d go public with that (taped) exchange.</p>
<p>I hope AMREN keeps the spotlight on this situation so we can see if the county suits have any courage.</p>

			<p>News Flash to the NAACP: there are few Blacks in authority positions in Montgomery County police administration because most Blacks just aren&rsquo;t qualified.</p>
<p>A government survey found that Federal management positions require an IQ of at least 120.  That requirement alone precludes over 99% of ALL Blacks in this country.</p>
<p>If I were a criminal that wanted to get away with my crimes, as most do, I&rsquo;d want the detectives who are tracking me down to have the lowest IQs as possible, so Affirmative Action hirings would be to my advantage.  Criminals hate smart cops.  </p>
<p>This is probably why the NAACP wants more Black detectives in Black neighborhoods.  More Black cops means fewer arrests, and fewer violent murderers and rapists on death row, which puts everyone, Blacks and Whites, at higher risk of these crimes.  Black &#8220;Logic&#8221; is interesting, to say the least.</p>

			<p>Affirmative action leads to incompetent people being force-hired by employers. Incompetence leads to firing. <br/>
Instead of trying to prevent these justified firings, they should turn their attention to the illegal and unconstitutional abomination called &#8220;affirmative action&#8221;, and eliminate it.</p>

			<p>If blacks don&rsquo;t want to be policed by white faced officers, they can move to Philadelphia. What do you want: more criminals in your neighborhood, or more black officers pulling you over when you run a redlight? Make a choice. In the meantime, shut up.</p>

			<p>If you are really going to be fair and honest (blacks) should be limited to 13.5% of the positions to coincide with their population percentage, shouldn&rsquo;t they? If you have more than 13.5% isn&rsquo;t that excessive and denying others their rightful representation? But then again the poor, poor, blacks genius is always overlooked and without priorities these poor black souls would be forced to do without or with less than their fair share. It seems to me that they should be ashamed of the fact that they can&rsquo;t earn their due.</p>

<p>Our local angry-black-radio-talk-show-host was once a cop. He says that he ignored crime and let people in his community off all the time. If he heard about someone doing numbers, he ignored it. If he stopped a guy, before he searched them, he told them to drop anything before he found it on them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the black community is crime ridden. Black police in black neighborhoods refuse to see blacks as criminals and they let them go. The criminals are then emboldened to commit even more brazen crimes knowing they have a friend on the force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I say, let blacks become cops on the condition they police their own communities.</p>

<p>  So if whites working in the black community is &#8220;polarizing&#8221; why is it not &#8220;polarizing&#8221; to have blacks working among whites ?<br/>
  Ask the NAACP that when they come asking for donations and if you get the same response from a &#8220;self proclaimed important member of the NAACP that I did, (He said it is because,&#8221; #@#% only whites can be racist.!&#8221;) Tell him he is a black racist bigot to leave.</p>

			<p>After years of anti-white rhetoric and turning its head on black on white violence and racial cleansing, the NAACP is feared by non-blacks as a kind of hate group - specifically a hate white group.  I&rsquo;ve never witnessed the NAACP standing up for justice when their is black on white hate crimes.  And they&rsquo;ve had tens of thousands of opportunities to do so but they don&rsquo;t because they are a hate group that was backed by Bolsheviks.</p>

****************************************<br/>
Many years ago,  when in need of police assistance, I had  two  separate experiences  with two (different) black cops  &mdash;    both of whom were  OUTSTANDING.  I still remember them.  (One of them helped an elderly neighbor of mine, and could not have been more considerate and courteous.)  They handled the situations beautifully, professionally, and very competently.    </p>
<p>There was a third incident I recall, when two menacing street thugs trying to mooch some money (and not taking &#8220;no&#8221; for an answer), had brazenly followed me right into a bank.  I went up to the security guard  (black, and a big tough guy, probably an ex-cop or marine) and told him they were following me, demanding money.  He handled it with amazing aplomb. He picked up those two junkies by the collar, both of them, marched them right out and  dumped them on the sidewalk!  They went!!!  It  was incredible to see two menacing toughs suddenly collapse into meek little kids and go without a whimper!  In his hands, they were like three-year olds.</p>
<p>This was before affirmative action hiring, before standards (physical and mental) had been lowered, before females were on patrol, and before the whole &#8220;civil rights&#8221;  hysteria about equality had taken over the country.  I&rsquo;m talking the 60s  here.  There weren&rsquo;t a lot of black cops back then, but they were GOOD ones who got hired.   Now, from the  short, fat, black female slugs that I see waddling down the street in uniforms, I would not want to have to rely on them for help in any emergency situation.  Yes, &#8220;we&rsquo;ve come a long way baby&#8221;   &mdash;    we sure have.  There are a lot more blacks on the street now (and females), but it&rsquo;s been downhill all the way.   We&rsquo;ve achieved equality at the cost of quality.</p>

<p>Darn right! When a incompetent, dishonest or ANY Black incapable of doing his job is fired and the &#8220;racist&#8221; charges fly. They want &#8220;respect?&#8221; Here&rsquo;s a heretical idea: Try doing a good job. Live a decent, law abiding life. Repect has to be EARNED. It is not an automatic or legislated right   &mdash;   which applies to us Whites also.</p>

			<p>If I have this straight, this black cop was fired for tipping off a suspect.  This isn&rsquo;t going to earn him much sympathy in court if he decides to sue.  Is the NAACP really so wildly out of touch that they can&rsquo;t practice some triage on the causes they decided to take up?</p>

			<p>In other good news, Mumia Abu Jamal was denied a new trial.  Perhaps the NAACP can further advance their own irrelevance by publically fretting about the well-being of this unrepentant killer.</p>
