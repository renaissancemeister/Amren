				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Slim Allagui, AFP, Oct. 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>M&rsquo;BOSSARAN Ciss still feels knots in her stomach when she recalls the night a stray bullet zipped through a window during dinner at a friend&rsquo;s apartment in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two minutes earlier, I was standing at the window right in the path of the bullet and I could have died,&rdquo; the Guinean dancer told AFP.</p>
<p>The bullet went through the living room window before lodging in the wall just above the door.</p>
<p>Denmark&rsquo;s accustomed calm has been brutally shattered in recent weeks, as a violent turf war has escalated between Hell&rsquo;s Angels bikers and youths of immigrant origin with a raft of shootings across the capital.</p>
<p>The bullet that interrupted Ciss&rsquo;s dinner party on October 11 had been fired by a member of an immigrant gang who was being chased through the streets by three men in a car.</p>
<p>In the past two months alone, police say there have been 25 shootings in Copenhagen&rsquo;s otherwise peaceful streets, leaving one person dead and six injured from both sides.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The long-simmering conflict between the two gangs exploded into full-blown war after a 19-year-old man of Turkish origin named Osam Nuri Dogan, who was armed and wearing a bullet-proof vest, was executed on the street on August 19.</p>
<p>His body was riddled with 25 bullets in front of a Copenhagen pizza parlour.</p>
<p>A member of Hell&rsquo;s Angels suspected of the killing was arrested but was soon released for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Since then, the violence and the often racially-loaded insults flung between the two camps have grown.</p>
<p>In an attempt to stem the clashes between Hell&rsquo;s Angels, its offshoot AK81 and the gangs of mainly third-generation immigrants, police have launched a vast operation in Copenhagen and in the western town of Aarhus and central town of Odense, seizing &ldquo;over 200 illegal fire arms&rdquo;, according to the justice ministry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the massive police action, the violence has continued.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently called for sending even more police into the streets, insisting on the need to &ldquo;immediately bring an end to this fighting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He cautioned that allowing the violence to continue could result in it spilling over into &ldquo;societal clashes between Danes and immigrants in general&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is why &ldquo;we are fighting both the motorcycle gangs and the criminal immigrants who are contributing to the lacking security in our cities&rdquo;, Rasmussen said.</p>
<p>While all the political parties have expressed their concern over the mounting violence, the centre-left opposition insists the government bears part of the responsibility for the increase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government has failed in its social efforts and in long-term integration efforts, which could have helped avoid having these youths join gangs,&rdquo; Karen Haekkerup, a spokeswoman for the opposition Social Democrats, said.</p>
<p>Police acknowledge that they are losing the battle to halt the violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mission impossible. We hope that our efforts will at least help lessen the violence,&rdquo; Munch said.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Government can&rsquo;t stop fighting between Danish Hell&rsquo;s Angels and immigrant gangs.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was fully expected and predicted, so it&rsquo;s not like they never had a clue.  </p>
<p>The only facts they have to come to grips with now is that soon the fighting will be with immigrants andthe average Dane.</p>
<p>Amd like everything else about these predictions, they&rsquo;ll be ignored by the multicults until they&rsquo;re upon them and they perplexed as to what they might do to simmier things down.  Never will it occur to them to stop the inflow of trouble-making rabble.</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;ll end up mostly prosecuting the Hell&rsquo;s Angels because they can actually identify and find them. In Denmark, it&rsquo;s easier to find white men wearing motorcycle jackets than it is to figure out which immigrants are involved and which ones are not. They are going to have a tough time infiltrating some immigrant gang or find someone who speaks their language willing to flip on them. Yeah, it&rsquo;ll turn into a witch hunt for the Angel&rsquo;s while the foreigners walk. </p>

			<p>Dont get me wrong when i say this, i don&rsquo;t approve of this kind of domestic violence and bloodshed, with so many innocents that can get caught in between.</p>
<p>But im fully supporting the HA&rsquo;s in this. Its the governments fault for &#8220;embracing diversity&#8221; to begin with. This is the consequence, as seen world wide, of diversity. </p>
<p>Its Danish land, it does not belong to nonwhites, who so crassly move on in and start trying to go &#8220;Islamic&#8221; on the population. And so, since the government refuses to take the steps necessary against this infection on their culture. It, sadly, is up to the citizens to stand up and defend themselves. The &#8220;Hells angels&#8221; may not be the epitome of white grandeur, but they at least fight against these invading forces in place of the self-defeating governing elite.</p>

			<p>Nowhere on Earth do different races or religions get along.  Even in those places where there is little expressed violence, there is still simmering resentment, suspicion, and hatred. Violence is always just below the surface.  Why expose your country to this? Why expose your children to this?  Why not simply let each race and each religion live in their own separate nations?  Why is it so important to our Global Elites that all races and religions MUST be mixed together?    </p>

			<p>In Canada, the &#8216;motorcycle gangs&rsquo; live on as mature, organized-crime syndicates, who uneventfully contract out the street level drug dealing to immigrants.</p>
<p>I suspect that because Denmark is such a small, accessible  country, and immigrants can set up their own drug import networks, that the battles are over control of the domestic drug trade.</p>
<p>Although they may be unsavory, I hope the Danish home team wins. </p>

			<p>Leftists around the world actually believe that whites are to blame when nonwhites commit violent crimes.</p>
<p>After all, they &#8220;failed&#8221; in their &#8220;social efforts and long-term integration efforts which could have helped avoid having these youths join gangs.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The only solution to this problem is to round up the minorities, strip them of citizenship and expel them.  If they don&rsquo;t (and I don&rsquo;t expect they will), the unrest will continue and get worse until it results in the overthrow of the government.  Then, the dominant side will exterminate the other.</p>
<p>Just part of the pattern of rising fascism is europe and surrounding lands.  The rise of fascism is an unavoidable consequence of balkanization.  When the problem is still small, a large enough amount of totalitarian effort can keep things quiet.  But, as the race mixing increases, the situation quickly grows beyond any amount of power to stop the violence.  Unrest becomes open warfare, which morphs into revolution, as the government becomes increasingly irrelevant and the police and military forces are forced to choose sides (often in order to defend themselves).  One side gains the upper hand&hellip;and completely destroys the other side.</p>
<p>Since there is no place to push the losing side back to, no border or fence to separate the two (or more) sides, the result becomes ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s small, unimportant countries, the international community, at tremendous cost, and effort, can put a stop to this&hellip;.at least temporarily.  But, when it becomes every country, especially those usually tasked with providing such policing, this becomes impossible.</p>
<p>The only way to stop this, would be for Denmark to round up the minorities, strip them of citizenship and kick them out without process or recourse.  That would solve the problem, stop the violence and prevent this situation from escalating.</p>
<p>But they won&rsquo;t do that.  And failing to do so, plants the seeds of their governments demise.  Those minorities will eventually be gotten rid of&hellip;.but the process will likely be FAR more uglier than simply deporting them.</p>

			<p>Interesting, glad you posted it. I knew I&rsquo;d find the truth on the Amren. </p>
<p>CNN this afternoon, on the show hosted by Rick Sanchez, showed aobut 4 or 5 minutes of video and claimed it was a clash between the police and squatters. I knew there was more to it than that. </p>
<p>By the way, that Sanchez guy looks almost like a Spaniard, but he just loves the Mexican invasion.</p>
<p>Bottom line, the MSM is good for clues, but then you have to go to the internet or Amren to get the real story. </p>
<p>We Whites are really in a mess. God help us! </p>

			<p>Though this could be over drug turf, as some suggest I&rsquo;m not so sure about that.  I&rsquo;m wondering. Maybe thye Danish bikers are just trying to protect their own local neighborhoods from the &#8220;imigrants&#8221; and their dirt, squalor, noise and crime. After all, they (the Danes) live there, and they want to keep their neighborhoods crime-free. That&rsquo;s understandable.  I know that in New York, Little Italy (Mafia territory!) is considered one of the best and safest places to live in the city. No nonsense is allowed to happen there! The Mafia does its business elsewhere. Not where their families live. I was told that by some detectives I know and also by a friend who lives there. So, maybe it&rsquo;s the same story in Denmark. I guess the Hells Angels would be Copenhagen&rsquo;s equivalent to the Mafia.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;d sure like to know what the cause of all this friction is about. I note that the story is vague about details. And according to the government, it&rsquo;s just about prejudice.  If only we could get a story with some objectivity! Oh well, I also note that the story comes from Agence France Presse, and is written by someone with an Arabic name.   Nuff said. You&rsquo;re not going to read anything critical of immigrants there.</p>

<p><br>
Typical pie-in-the-sky social-democratic nonsense. Please, Ms. Haekkerup, explain exactly WHICH &#8220;social and integration efforts&#8221; would have made Viking bikers and Muslim Third Worlders sit down together and enjoy a nice chat over coffee and pastries? The Angels aren&rsquo;t interested in talking to your social workers, and neither are the immigrants. </p>
<p>The Angels and the Mohammedans have NOTHING in common (except possibly the drugs trade), and no amount of asinine social-engineering schemes will EVER change that.  </p>

			<p>European Hells Angels are pretty mainstream.  They own a pretty nice series of pubs and actually do a pretty good public relations service for all things american.  Things must be really bad up in Denmark.</p>

<p>Oh really? Isn&rsquo;t that surprising. Guess this Karen Haekkerup didn&rsquo;t know the old saying that an ounce of prevention is as good as a pound of cure. Their prevention being that they weren&rsquo;t wise enough to avoid letting these 3rd world minorities into their country to begin with. You reap what you sow. </p>

			<p>Some might say karma considering the number of places invaded by Vikings over the centuries, but at least they brought quality high IQ genes with them wherever they went. With this crop of 3rd worlders the Danes are just importing too many low IQ genes. They will always be a problem by European standards, at least until their presence debases those standards.</p>
<p>Your time to turn this around is running short, Europe.</p>

			<p>The Danish Bikers are modern versions of the early Jutes and Saxons, or perhaps the Vikings, either way those peoples would not stand for such, not out of racism, but tribal self preservation. They all found valor in fighting, may they find it again.</p>

			<p>Why are Arabs or Turks in Denmark outside of visiting or education??? For all our frontal lobe pholosophizing we are still grounded in biology and un less we defend out racial identity it will go the way of the dinasaur. I was in Denmark and Arhus in paricular, I noticed a few things,&hellip;many of the women were beatiful and the people in general were an attractive healthy educated bunch! Now this has to change apparently,&hellip; They need to be Intigrated/Mischeginated with muslems, they can not just go on as a nice example of nordic existence they need to lose their racial identity or be called hateful racist evil zenophobic etc&hellip;. There seems to be a globaly concerted effort to Re distribute genetic wealth in every white area, white people are simply not allowed to exist, they have no right to their genetic inheritance they Must share it/Lose it with others or be robbed/raped of it. Genetic Marxism&hellip;.Genetic Marxism&hellip;Genetic Marxism&hellip;</p>

<p>Yes, the only way to get organized crime out is thru draconian laws.<br>
The orgy of law-passing during the last century demonstrates that statism is the only way to achieve paradise on earth, and that it is the only way to stop the special interests from controlling the state.</p>

			<p>You know your government has failed you when you have to rely on outlaw bikers to rid the streets of 3rd world Islamic immigrant gangs.  <br>
The Danes have to be asking themselves by now, &#8220;Why are these people even allowed to come here?&#8221;  </p>

			<p>It seems that Finland is the only Nordic country with the most homogenous population (97% are Finnish). Yes, they have immigrants but they come mainly from Russia, Estonia and Sweden. I hope they can learn from their other European neighbours and don&rsquo;t open their doors to mass immigration from undeveloped countries. </p>
