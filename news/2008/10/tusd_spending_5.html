<h1>TUSD Spending $550,000 to Recruit Highly Qualified, Minority Teachers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chelsey Killebrew, Arizona Daily Star (Tucson), October 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tucson Unified School District officials hope that kind of connection through culture will help them reach other students, too.</p>
<p>The district has launched a $550,000 effort to recruit highly qualified and minority teachers, hoping to diversify its staff and give minority students a better chance of seeing themselves as part of the education system.</p>
<p>Experts say the feeling of belonging translates into long-term success for students, an important goal for a district whose minority students traditionally trail Anglo counterparts in academic achievement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 40 percent of Tucson&rsquo;s population is Hispanic, according to 2005 U.S. Census Bureau numbers, the most recent available. That year, about 24 percent of TUSD teachers were Hispanic. Last year, the number fell to about 21 percent.</p>
<p>TUSD employed 1,009 high school teachers last year, and five were American Indian. There were two Asian teachers in all middle schools combined. Anglo teachers made up 74 percent of the teaching staff.</p>
<p>Experts tend to support the idea that schools should reflect the populations they serve.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Miscommunication can arise between ethnicities because of different cultural upbringings, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also, children begin to associate achievement in school with a certain ethnicity when they don&rsquo;t have teachers of the same ethnicity to look up to, Evans said. School needs to represent a place where all people can excel, she added.</p>
<p>The benefits aren&rsquo;t just for minority students, either, Evans said. A diverse faculty &#8220;helps European-American kids realize they have something to learn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We need to build on each other&rsquo;s knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Richard Foster heads the TUSD effort, and he will travel to other cities and states in search of minority teachers.</p>
<p>His recruiting strategies include attending job fairs, participating in educational-diversity fairs, visiting historically black colleges and urban areas with large black populations, and reaching out to American Indian and Hispanic communities.</p>
<p>TUSD also will use the Internet as an advertising tool to gain national exposure, Foster said.</p>

			<p>&#8220;visiting historically black colleges and urban areas with large black populations, &#8220;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the racist, xenophobic ultra nationalistic hispanics will welcome blacks into &#8220;their&#8221; schools.</p>
<p>Affirmative action teachers are just that, affirmative action dregs.  Affirmative action is just another word for unqualified.</p>
<p>Hitler did something like this in April of 1933.  Only he did not bother calling it affirmative action for Aryan Germans.  He ws at least honest when he ordered the German school system to fire all Jewish teachers and employees.</p>
<p>What a difference a word makes.</p>
<p>Hitler ruled as an appointed, non elected chancellor.  America is ruled by appointed, non elected white hating racist judges.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?  None  The extermination of whites from America will just take a little more time due to our having been the majority of the population.  But we are what 65% and going down?  What will the census of 2010 reveal?</p>
<p>And at what percentage have our masters like Soros decided to begin our extermination?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Experts tend to support the idea that schools should reflect the populations they serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>So &#8220;experts&#8221; are in favor of segregation??</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to build on each other&rsquo;s knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Make up your mind. Either we can learn from each other or we need our own as teachers. Either we can build on each other&rsquo;s knowledge or &#8220;we teachers of the same ethnicity to look up to&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have a better idea. If you are not white, do not read anything written by a white person. If you are black, only read books written by other blacks. If you are American Indian, only read books written by other Indians. If you are Hispanic, only read books written by other Hispanics. Now are you happy?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the same goes for inventions, products, businesses, and other shopping. Definitely, do not go to a white doctor, dentist, or pharmacist. Do not go to any white hospital. Do not use honkey medicine&hellip;.or his computers&hellip;.or drive his cars. Yeah, that would work.</p>

			<p>I am a teacher in the Tucson Unified School District. There was no need for this expenditure. We already have a large percentage of hispanic teachers and administrative staff in the district, because we have a large percentage of people with hispanic heritage living here that become teachers or otherwise become employed by the school district. I am at a complete loss as to why this recruitment drive was thought to be necessary.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Minority&#8221; teachers are far less likely to be &#8220;highly qualified.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Experts tend to support the idea that schools should reflect the populations they serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>What &#8220;experts&#8221; are those? Doesn&rsquo;t this conflict with the whole &#8220;highly qualified&#8221; thing? And shouldn&rsquo;t white students, under this theory, have white teachers?</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, children begin to associate achievement in school with a certain ethnicity when they don&rsquo;t have teachers of the same ethnicity to look up to, Evans said.&#8221;</p>
<p>What conclusion will children draw when they discover that mestizo teachers aren&rsquo;t much brighter than mestizo students?</p>
<p>This is pork-barrel affirmative action politics disguised as educational theory.</p>

			<p><i>Children begin to associate achievement in school with a certain ethnicity when they don&rsquo;t have teachers of the same ethnicity to look up to.</i></p>
<p>In other words, the children are racists, and they direct that racism at themselves.</p>
<p>Really, that&rsquo;s what this is saying.</p>

			<p>How is a diverse teaching faculty going to give the students a sense of &#8220;belonging&#8221;?</p>
<p>The students are there BECAUSE OF STATE LAW MANDATES, not because of voluntary school attendance. When I went to grammar school, I had no choice as to the kind of teacher I wanted. Fortunately, most of the ones I had stimulated us to learn something.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t even matter to me that most of my schoolteachers were female. I thought schoolteaching was a female occupation (like nursing and secretarial work), and actually regarded male schoolteachers as freaks.  </p>

			<p>I was unfortunate to get a black marxist atheists for Anthropology. That was a long class. Had to listen to indoctrination lectures for hours on end and my consent and agreement were simply &#8220;assumed&#8221; by the instructor. What a farce. That should be the first place they cut the fat out of the budget.</p>

			<p>  If it is assumed to be true that students will perform better with teachers that look like them, then how do the powers-that-be explain the black drop-out rate at schools with predominately black teachers??  Just a thought.</p>

			<p>How exactly do minority teachers help white students learn better?  We are endlessly told that black students learn better with black teachers, and that Hispanic students learn better with Hispanic teachers.  Doesn&rsquo;t it naturally follow that white children would learn better with white teachers?</p>

			<p>We have a problem, folks: if each non-White ethnic group gets their own teachers to look up to as successful role models, won&rsquo;t that mean that schools will automatically become &#8220;Separate, but unequal&#8221;?  </p>
