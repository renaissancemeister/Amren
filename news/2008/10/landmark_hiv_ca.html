<h1>&#8216;Landmark&rsquo; HIV Case Goes to Trial</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allison Jones, Canadian Press, Oct. 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man facing first-degree murder charges for allegedly spreading the virus that causes AIDS will see his case go before a jury Monday in what&rsquo;s believed to be the first prosecution of its kind in Canada.</p>
<p>Johnson Aziga, 52, has spent five years in pre-trial custody while cycling through several legal teams.</p>
<p>Two women died after allegedly having unprotected sex with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a landmark case,&rdquo; Mr. Aziga&rsquo;s lawyer, Davies Bagambiire, said in an interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first time that a Canadian is prosecuted for alleged murder through the alleged dissemination or transmission of the HIV virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Aziga, a former research analyst with Ontario&rsquo;s Ministry of the Attorney General, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and 11 counts of aggravated sexual assault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look forward to the evidence unfolding so I can shake it up, cross-examine and demonstrate the holes in the evidence that I believe exist,&rdquo; Mr. Bagambiire said.</p>
<p>Alison Symington, with the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, said the case is significant but adds the allegations against Mr. Aziga are rare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are 60,000 people living with HIV in Canada,&rdquo; said Ms. Symington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are very rare cases indeed, but there&rsquo;s so much attention to them and so much misinformation and panic around them that it really kind of increases stigma and discrimination, which ultimately may be counterproductive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The best way to protect the public is to educate them so that HIV-positive feel comfortable disclosing their status to sexual partners, Ms. Symington said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Condoms, disclosure: that&rsquo;s going to prevent transmission. Criminal charges aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>There has been a notable increase in criminal charges for HIV transmission since about 2000, Symington added.</p>
<p>Clato Mabior, an HIV-positive man in Winnipeg, was sentenced earlier this month to 14 years in prison on six counts of aggravated sexual assault, as well as one count each of invitation to sexual touching and sexual interference.</p>
<p>Mr. Mabior&rsquo;s trial heard that none of the half-dozen females, ranging in age from 12 to adults, that he had sex with became infected.</p>
<p>Carl Leone was handed an 18-year sentence on April 4 after pleading guilty in Windsor, Ont., to 15 counts of aggravated sexual assault after failing to inform his sexual partners of his HIV status. Five of the 15 women are now HIV positive.</p>
<p>Former Saskatchewan Roughrider Trevis Smith, who is HIV positive, was sentenced Feb. 26, 2007, to 5 1/2 years in prison for aggravated sexual assault. He was found guilty for knowingly exposing two women to the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
<p>Mr. Bagambiire said he believes his client will not be found guilty but, if he is, Mr. Aziga would get double credit for time his five years of pre-trial custody.</p>
<p>That could also be multiplied if Mr. Aziga&rsquo;s legal team successfully argues that time was spent in poor conditions, Mr. Bagambiire said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other inmates attack him because they stigmatize him because of his HIV status,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Monday is the fifth trial date to have been set in Mr. Aziga&rsquo;s case, largely due to adjournments sought by the defence and Mr. Aziga&rsquo;s firing of three previous legal teams.</p>
<p>Mr. Bagambiire takes exception to characterizing the moves as delays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really we call it fair trial,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice can&rsquo;t be done in a hurry. If you do justice in a hurry you end up with miscarriages of justice. Yes, time has passed, but that time has been worth it.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>&#8220;The best way to protect the public is to educate them so that HIV-positive feel comfortable disclosing their status to sexual partners, Ms. Symington said.&#8221;</p>
<p>This method will take at least 1,000 years. Do they disclose their status before or after?</p>
<p>I can just imagine the bar pick-up line&#8221; I&rsquo;ve got a highly communicable incurable deadly sexually transmitted disease. My place or yours.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Condoms, disclosure: that&rsquo;s going to prevent transmission. Criminal charges aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>If she is an AIDS worker, she knows perfectly well that condoms do not prevent the spread of AIDS at all.  They are useless because condoms are designed to block semen and sperm and cannot block the much tinier viruses.</p>
<p>Sperm are much, much larger than the AIDS virus.  The AIDS virus goes right through even the very best condom.  AIDS researchers have discovered that it takes 4 condoms to block the transmission of the AIDS virus through the condom. And even 4 does not work.</p>
<p>Plus Mr. Aziga, like most third world immigrants to Canada regards condoms as an insult to his masculinity and sex life.</p>
<p>If Miss useful idiot were a medical researcher rather than a defender of those who spread AIDS she would know that.</p>

			<p>The government official directly responsible for allowing this <a href="https://www.citynews.ca/news/news_28269.aspx" rel="nofollow">&#8220;winner&#8221;</a> into Canada, should also be standing next to him in the court docket.</p>
<p>But, this story is only the tip of the iceberg and illustrates the seriousness of imported African HIV cases. Similar to almost any western country struggling with this deadly disease &hellip;we feel impelled to import even more of the same?? </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://canadianimmigrationreform.blogspot.com/2008/08/another-hiv-infected-african-immigrant.html" rel="nofollow">another similar example</a> showing how Canada&rsquo;s foolish refugee policies are allowed to slowly kill off our population.</p>

			<p>On a farm the first thing you do with a diseased animal is seperate it from the rest of your stock (well that is, if you are smart and value your stock).<br>
You take it outside to the back of a barn and put a bullet in it&rsquo;s head. <br>
And burn it&rsquo;s corpse.<br>
In the human population we invite (in western countries at least) the diseased animals to mingle amonst the masses, because everyone is equal.<br>
Then we let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Mabior&rsquo;s trial heard that none of the half-dozen females, ranging in age from 12 to adults, that he had sex with became infected&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..sex with a 12yr old, he sounds like a really classy guy, an hiv positive pedophile.<br>
The modern world is a nightmare.</p>

<p>Pffft. This guy wants to drag the case out as long as possible so he can keep charging his client or the government or whoever&rsquo;s paying his bills for every paper clip, xeroxed letter and business lunch. There&rsquo;s no excuse for ANY trial to take this long. None. I mean, there&rsquo;s a chance this guy could be innocent (though I doubt it). Technically, he IS innocent until proven guilty, right? So he ends up rotting in some cell for FIVE years? What&rsquo;s so difficult about a case like this that would take five years? FInd out who he was sleeping with. Find out if he actually has AIDS. FInd out if he knew about his condition beforehand. That last one shouldn&rsquo;t be so hard. Maybe a doctor gave him his diagnosis before he had sex with one of his partners. Presto. Weeks, maybe. A couple of months. But five years? Sorry about the rant, but the extreme ineptitude and slowness of court systems in general drives me crazy.</p>

			<p>Many sub saharan and north african blacks spread HIV in white countries that have adopted multiculturalism when their objective to over celebrate and overconsume is never enough.<br>
After that it becomes a matter of taking down as many envy inspiring whites with you as you can when you die.</p>

			<p>How many of these people doing this are from or desended from 3rd world countries??? I&rsquo;ll bet 95% of them are. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that whites haven&rsquo;t done this because some have but they do it  less than 3rd worlders. Without 3rd world immigration, 95% of the cases would NOT have happened/</p>

			<p>There are two causes for this. One is immigration. If these people hadn&rsquo;t been allowed to immigrate, this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened. Two, the brainwashing of the young. Young people from infancy on are pushed to race mix romantically. If you don&rsquo;t agree, than you are an evil racist. Race mixing is aggressivley promoted through the media, in MTV, in the schools, society and everywhere. Even though I live in the US, not Canada, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the same there. Also, as a white white female, I&rsquo;ve had many a black male hit on me in the course of my life and many are shall I say smooth. However, I have lived around large numbers of blacks as my state has many so I understand their ways. However, white females in places like Canada are clueless when it comes to blacks because they aren&rsquo;t exposed to them so they buy their smooth talk.</p>

			<p>These reports seem to crop up on a regular basis - always the same story, one young vigorous black buck (usually from sub Saharan Africa)moves into a lily-white community, young buck is a &#8216;gig hit with the ladies&rsquo;, young buck is subsequently found to have infected a multitude of impressionable White women with HIV.<br>
 Canada, Australia, the USA, England, Finland - the pattern is always the same - the mysterious black stranger (with unfathomable &#8216;charm&rsquo;)in the White town comes (no pun intended)and bestows the &#8216;gift&rsquo; of AIDS to the naive women of the town.Almost like a mediaeval fairy tale or parable.<br>
   I like to call these stories &#8216;Darwin Award stories&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t even matter about race.  ANYONE, black, white or whatever that has an infectious disease such as Aids or TB, should not be allowed to immigrate into the country. Even if said person behaved responsibly and didn&rsquo;t spread their disease, they still will cost the government large sums in treatment. It&rsquo;s about common sense.</p>

<p>Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in preventing heterosexual sexual transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Research on the effectiveness of latex condoms in preventing heterosexual transmission is both comprehensive and conclusive. The ability of latex condoms to prevent transmission has been scientifically established in laboratory studies as well as in epidemiologic studies of uninfected persons at very high risk of infection because they were involved in sexual relationships with HIV-infected partners. The most recent meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies of condom effectiveness was published by Weller and Davis in 2004. This analysis refines and updates their previous report published in 1999. <b>The analysis demonstrates that the consistent use of latex condoms provides a <i>high degree</i> of protection against heterosexual transmission of HIV. It should be noted that condom use cannot provide absolute protection against HIV.</b> The surest way to avoid transmission of HIV is to abstain from sexual intercourse or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and you know is uninfected.</p>

			<p>Here is the thing. It is easy to bash these young women and say they got what they deserved for being so stupid. However, I do blame society. Did these young women&rsquo;s  warn them about the increase in diseases amongst blacks? Does the media tell the truth in regards to this issue or keep it hushed our of PC??? Answer, they largely keep it hushed out of PC. All of their young lives, these women have had it pounded into them over and over by their schools and society that there are no racial differences and failure to date a black who asks you is racist. These women were not given the facts things, have been brainwashed with PC and plus combine that with the type of immigration policies western governments have today and this is what you get.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;However, I blame society.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t blame society at all. People are still expected to think for themselves, especially about issues relating to their own health.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hear what you are saying and I agree IF people  have the full facts. However, the MSM covers up a lot of the statistics when it comes to blacks and disease. Also, when you have young people who have been indoctrinated from birth, it&rsquo;s very difficult for them to see things from a different perspective, especially when society and the MSM and their schools and even their own parents are telling them otherwise. With maturity comes wisdom. When I was 18, I couldn&rsquo;t see the truth, twenty years later, with maturity and experience, I can.</p>
