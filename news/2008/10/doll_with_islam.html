				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Morgan-Scott, Owasso (Oklahoma) Reporter, October 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Gary Rofkahr from Owasso heard there was a baby doll on local store shelves that said, &#8220;Islam is the Light,&#8221; he didn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>He bought the Little Mommy Real Loving Baby Cuddle and Coo doll to see for himself and he was shocked to hear the words, &#8220;Islam is the Light&#8221; among other baby gibberish including &#8220;Mama.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He called Fisher Price to complain. He was told they were aware of the problem and would gladly refund his money.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told them I didn&rsquo;t want my money back, I wanted them to pull these dolls off the shelf,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They told me they can&rsquo;t pull an item just because a customer requests it, they have to have corporate direction. I told them I would get corporate direction and get back to them. I told them I&rsquo;m from a town of 30,000 people with 46 churches in it and I know someone who attends each one. I&rsquo;m going to everyone I know to tell them about this and I&rsquo;m going to call Target and Wal-Mart and see if we can pull this doll off the shelves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve pulled it,&#8221; said Mitzi Tatowicz, co-manager of the Owasso Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>She said Wal-Mart had heard about the doll and its recording several days ago and pulled the doll from the local store. Apparently, overnight the dolls had been put back on the shelves, but Tatowicz said &#8220;We&rsquo;ve voluntarily pulled them and believe they shouldn&rsquo;t be on our shelves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local Target officials refused to comment on whether the dolls were still on shelves and directed the Owasso Reporter to a corporate media relations phone number that went directly to voicemail. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Update &mdash; Reporter Amanda Morgan-Scott received a reply from her email to Mattel. The email has been copied and pasted in full below.</p>
<p>As a result of a recent news report regarding our Little Mommy Cuddle &rsquo;n Coo dolls saying an inappropriate phrase, we immediately undertook a thorough investigation to fully understand the issue. A summary of our findings include:</p>
<p>*The Little Mommy Cuddle &rsquo;n Coo dolls feature realistic baby sounds including sweet cooing, giggling and baby babble with no real sentence structure.</p>
<p>*The only scripted word that the doll actually says is &#8220;mama.&#8221; There is a sound that may resemble something close to the word &#8220;night, right, or light.&#8221; All of the other sounds are baby sounds with no real words or sentence structure.</p>
<p>*We have found that if told to listen for a particular phrase, you may hear something similar due to the power of suggestion.</p>
<p>*Actual sounds may be imprecise due to sound compression played through the very tiny inexpensive toy speakers from the doll.</p>
<p>As a result of these findings, we remain confident in the high quality standards of our Little Mommy Cuddle &rsquo;n Coo dolls. If any consumer has any questions or concerns regarding any Mattel toys, they may contact our Mattel consumer relations center at 800/524-TOYS (8697), and we will be happy to assist them. We take each call from our consumers very seriously and do our best to help address their concerns.</p>

			<p>At least it does not seem that the doll was actually saying &#8220;Islam is the light&#8221;.  If Walmart ever starts carrying a Christian doll then you&rsquo;ll really see an uproar.</p>

			<p>This is the kind of sneak attack Americans are undergoing in many ways every day. This one just got noticed. I wonder how long the company would be in business and how much they would defend it if the doll had said &#8220;Jesus loves you&#8221;?</p>

<p>Although this idiot is trying to claim alot is being made about nothing, you can CLEARLY and DISTICTLY hear the phrase &#8220;Islam is the Light&#8221; being said by the doll.  There is no ambiguity.  It is clear as day and obviously intentional.</p>
<p>Understand what is going on here.  Liberals have taken over many institutions and corporations in our country and are bending them towards our destruction by any and all means possible.  TV&rsquo;s and movies are little more than blatant anti-white propaganda that portray every single normal value as being weak, ineffectual, stupid or somehow uncool, even evil.  News on most channels is so controlled it might as well be faked.  Political commentary, especially polls are outright fabrications.  Now, they&rsquo;ve crashed our economy, in an attempt to manipulate people into electing Obama into our political system.<br>

			<p>Actual sounds may be imprecise due to sound compression played through the very tiny inexpensive toy speakers from the doll.</p>
<p>So why doesn&rsquo;t Fisher Price hook the doll&rsquo;s sound unit up to a good amplifier and speakers and determine what was really recorded?</p>

			<p>Why not counter attack by marketing dolls that say things like, &#8220;Allah is Lucifer&#8221;, &#8220;Mohammed was a pedophile&#8221;, &#8220;Nuke Mecca&#8221;, and &#8220;Islam is Satanism&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Greetings to be a part of it. Just love the environment here. Good concept by the admin and mods and everyone here.</p>
<p>Just to kickstart, I would like to ask first if you&rsquo;re into those dressup doll games. Coz if you do, then imma have to ask you which one is better  &mdash;  -Barbie or Bratz games?</p>
<p><a/>Barbie games inspired a lot of other games. Bratz may deny it but the concept of many if not all Bratz games originated from Barbie. Take for example the many dress up games that Bratz fans are so addicted to right now. The ideas of these games all came from Barbie. Who invented changeable clothes, customizable accessories and colourful nail polishes and hair? Barbie did. Who incorporated real like perks like cars, hotels and hot cribs? Barbie did.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Bratz are so popular. There is no question about that. They are loved by kids and adults alike. This is the reason <a/>Bratz games are so popular. Whenever there is a new Bratz game, expect the millions of Bratz fans to play it. There is even a war going on between Bratz and Barbie fans. Who&rsquo;s better? Who&rsquo; sexier? Who&rsquo;s classier?</p>
