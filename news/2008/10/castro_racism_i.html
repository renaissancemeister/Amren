						<p>Fidel Castro says a &#8220;profound racism&#8221; in the United States will stop millions from voting for Barack Obama in next month&rsquo;s presidential election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Castro&rsquo;s written comments were published by state media Saturday. In them, he insists a &#8220;profound racism&#8221; exists in the U.S. and that millions of whites &#8220;cannot reconcile themselves to the idea that a black person .&nbsp;.&nbp;. could occupy the White House, which is called just that: white.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Castro wants us to vote Obama? Hey! I&rsquo;m sold.</p>
<p>The list of vile individuals and governments that are Obama supporters should be on the front page everyday. And its all the education any American needs to determine their vote. Its not the skin color, its the anti-American agenda.  </p>
<p>If the educational system in our country was doing its job, or the MSM doing its, Obama would never have been elected to any office. At best, he would still be employed as a community organizer.</p>
<p>Keep talkin&rsquo; Castro, Chavez, Qaddaffi, Madonna and all the rest&hellip; you only help McCain. <br>

			<p>&#8220;Fidel Castro says a &#8216;profound racism&rsquo; in the United States will stop millions from voting for Barack Obama in next month&rsquo;s presidential election.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laughable, utterly laughable; and who really cares about what that old Red thinks?</p>
<p>The last time I saw him, Comrade Fidel looked pretty pale; he looked to be about three shades whiter then me with the flu and food poisoning! With a bit of luck, he and Teddy Kennedy will drop dead within hours of each other, so that they may discourse on how they both wound up in Hell together? Particularly, the finer points of how &#8220;good,&#8221; but also godless Marxists, end up with looking at their real master, while his imps: Lenin, Stalin, and Mao laugh hysterically at them. </p>
<p>Enough said!</p>

			<p>Fidel Castro needs to keep his opinions to himself. He hasn&rsquo;t been in the US in over 60 years and has no idea what he is talking about. He is also next door to senile and I thought he was at death&rsquo;s door last winter. Somebody needs to muzzle the old fool.</p>

<p>How many blacks, mexicans or whatever does Castro let in??? None. The problem with the US is not that it is racist, quite the opposite, it is too tolerant. That&rsquo;s why we let Cubans ethnically cleanse and take over Miami. Would Cuba have allowed the reverse?? Never. Millions of whites will vote for Obama simply because he is black. Fidel doesn&rsquo;t understand the US at all.<br>

			<p>A famous Musician once said of the record business &#8220;there are very few accidents.&#8221;  He went on to say that the folks that run the Music business work out all that there is to work out so that things go &#8220;well&#8221;, for them. </p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just for record companies.  What do you think it is for Countries and their Governments?</p>
<p>My point is, I don&rsquo;t think there is any conincidence that Obama is coming AFTER Bush. Different Puppets, same Puppeteer. Their policies are pretty much the same.<br>
Also, has anyone else noticed the EXACT same pattern as in the 29 Crash?  With that one there was a Republican in the White House who had all of the blame dumped on him by a complicit media and then comes the &#8220;Savior&#8221;.  Exactly the same. Their tricks are getting easier to see.</p>
<p>And as far as Castro is concerned. Sometime back, while in Latin America, a few people were going on about how Castro was great for two reasons. 1 - he was a pain in the ass of the USA. and 2 - because he gave his people dignity.<br>
For the first point, I asked them if they ever considered the fact that he was installed there by the Real Owners of the USA (which would explain how his Ted Kennedy-like political longevity). <br>
And for the second I asked them this: How is it possible for anyone who allows their life to be controlled by a Dictator,  whose survival depends on denying everyone their basic freedoms, to have &#8220;dignity&#8221;?<br>
There followed one of the most enjoyable moments of silence in my entire life. </p>

There&rsquo;s no one more racist than Castro.  Cuban jails are full of black political prisoners.  As to those who go on and on about Cubans having ethnically cleansed Miami, those Cubans in Miami, etc., have tried for nearly 50 years to warn this country about communism, only to be dismissed as a bunch of right wing nut jobs.  Well, guess what?  Some call it socialism, which is nothing more than an euphomism for communism, already quite entrenched in this country, by mostly white folks (see william ayers, jeremiah wright, etc.) Good luck, we will all need it.  Just pray and hope that castro is right; for if he is not, the gates will be swung wide open to immigration from the third world, and this folks are not pro-U.S. Cubans, like most of those here, save for those spies sent by castro.   </p>

<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s so dignified that the highest earning person in the family is a 13 year old prostitute for tourists.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if machismo has survived 60 years of communism, but the fathers of those 13 year old prostitutes can&rsquo;t possible feel like proud paterfamilias who are able to take care of their families.<br>

			<p>Dedalus, again you have made some very illuminating comments, 10:53PM.</p>
<p>In essence you reaffirm that there are no accidents, or coincidences in politics. In my opinion, Obama was chosen and brough along by certain elites. The same thing goes for Comrade Castro. The communists in the U.S., the Universities, the newspapers, all supported him in 1959, just go to the archives and see. In other words, Comrade Castro was no coincidence either.</p>

<p>Comrade Fidel seems to know all about a race relations, a great man and wonderful dictator, whose words are spoken like a true Communist pig. <br>
Why would anyone think this cigar chewing murdered would say anything different, considering Hussein Obama and he are fellow disciples Carl Marx. <br>
Castro has accomplished nothing in Cuba, except made it a concentration camp, and is now supporting new pal Obama. <br>
The racist dielectric is a maxim of the communists, so he is stating the same trash about race that the communists have been using for over 100 years. <br>
One looser supporting another looser in life and politics.  Castro is a human waste like Stalin, Hitler and Mao, so it does not surprise me that he came out of his sewer to espouse the usual race rhetoric that the one-dimensional communist mind knows.</p>

			<p>Dedalus, AR rightly scorns the foolish beliefs in all-knowing, all-powerful conspiracies that many blacks have.  Joining the likes of Louis Farrakhan and slum barbershop loudmouths destroys your credibility and harms that of the pro-white cause.<br>
The music industry has been in a catastrophic free fall for years, largely because of rampant online &#8220;file sharing&#8221; piracy, which Apple&rsquo;s iTunes and the other legitimate vendors are only partially making up for.  Record executives are constantly caught flat-footed when they shell out huge dollars and are then left holding the bag by temperamental and unreliable talent (look at Britney Spears and Michael Jackson&rsquo;s disastrous career collapses, or &#8220;Prince&#8221; rebelling against his label and refusing to release his best material until he was out of his contract and only putting out contractually obligated records full of filler in an act of deliberate sabotage, etc etc), not to mention the fickle public (think of the droves of &#8220;hair metal&#8221; 80s bands that were ruined by the sudden popularity of &#8220;grunge&#8221;), etc etc etc.<br>
As for politics, claiming no difference between Obama and Bush is simple lunacy.<br>
True, neither is friendly to white nationalism, but there are many other issues.<br>
Speaking broadly (each has exceptions and details of course):<br>
Obama is &#8220;pro choice&#8221; on abortion, Bush is &#8220;pro life&#8221;.<br>
Obama favors defeat for America in Iraq, Bush favors victory.<br>
Obama favors tax hikes, gun control, and socialized medicine, Bush opposes them.<br>
As for Castro, it isn&rsquo;t some mysterious conspiracy keeping him in power, it&rsquo;s the police and the army - very physical and basic stuff, as anyone stewing in his own waste in a political prison, or on the receiving end of a beating can tell you.<br>
Wake the heck up.  Our situation is dire enough without being distracted by will-o-wisps, phantoms, and chimeras.  We need to face the world as it is.</p>

			<p>Cuba is run by Whites, and the non-Whites know it.  There was an article in the Times a couple years ago by two American women who visited Cuba, one fair, one dark.  The dark Cubans eyeballed the blonde, but would not approach her.  They knew their place.  They limited themselves to lewd overtures to the dark American.  </p>

<p>Geez, I guess I struck a nerve.  Good.<br>
Still, on the bright side, at least I&rsquo;ve upset someone who doesn&rsquo;t like me.<br>
But, save the insults, and shaming parent tone of voice - I don&rsquo;t need your approval.</p>
<p>As for the music industry comment it was just an analogy, and a good one.  The quote actually came from Robert Plant, the lead singer of Led Zeppelin.  I figure he ought to know what he was talking about.<br>
&#8220;Joining the likes of Louis Farrakhan and slum barbershop loudmouths destroys your credibility and harms that of the pro-white cause.&#8221;<br>
Honestly, Irish, that was a weird sentence. Dedalus and Louis Farrakhan?  Oh well, that one is too out there to even waste time on, let alone figuring out exactly how it destroys my credibility. But if it&rsquo;s enough to harm the &#8220;pro-white&#8221; cause (and what is that exactlty?) then it is easily harmed. Which it is  - OF COURSE!!!  I mean, we&rsquo;re relegated to a kind of Internet ghetto where a lot of intelligent, thoughtful people, heartsick at what is happening to our country have only a handful of websites to go to and yet STILL have to listen to assorted Career Criminals and Psychopaths like Robert Kennedy Jr. say the Media is controlled by the &#8220;Right-wing.&#8221;<br>
I doubt if a single comment or post is going to sink the &#8220;pro-white&#8221; cause.  Oh brother.<br>
Oh, and by the way, PEOPLE can be &#8220;all-knowing&#8221; and &#8220;all-powerful&#8221; but not Conspiracies. <br>

			<p>That&rsquo;s funny.  I live around lots of Cubans, and they won&rsquo;t vote for Obama because they suspect he&rsquo;s too much like Castro.</p>
<p>Make no bones about it, they call him a &#8220;very dangerous man&#8221;.  They also don&rsquo;t hesitate to chastise the little hipsters in their Che shirts with their communist pretenses.  That&rsquo;s a great way to get kicked out of a Cuban business!</p>
<p>According to them, Castro is running what amounts to a giant slave plantation, and they&rsquo;re having none of it.</p>
