<h1><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14996.html">Immigrants the New Face of &lsquo;Real America&rsquo;</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gebe Martinez, Politico.com, Oct. 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In an election season filled with hyperbole and lies, the truest moments came just in time for next week&rsquo;s election.</p>
<p>The candor came from Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and two GOP House members from Minnesota and North Carolina, who rallied for votes by suggesting that only some parts of the United States &mdash; presumably those that support them &mdash; are the &ldquo;real America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their spontaneity, which they later apologized for in the face of sliding support, revealed a state of denial in the changing American electorate. The truth is, the real America &mdash; the whole America &mdash; will be seen on Election Day, when the millions of votes by &ldquo;new Americans&rdquo; are counted.</p>
<p>New Americans, the fastest-growing voting bloc, are naturalized immigrants, mostly Hispanic, and the U.S.-born children of immigrants since 1965, according to a recent report by the Immigration Policy Center.</p>
<p>If political pollsters, campaign strategists, and civil rights and immigrants&rsquo; advocates are correct, these newer citizens will shatter voting records next week.</p>
<p>Their increasing numbers were widely anticipated, but their high rate of growth &ldquo;has been utterly unprecedented,&rdquo; observed Rob Paral, who studied the shifting electorate for the immigration center. </p>
<p>While the national voter registration rate rose 11.3 percent from 1996 to 2004, the new American sign-up rate jumped almost 60 percent, according to Paral. And they vote, too. In 2006, more than 7.3 million new Americans &mdash; two-thirds of those registered &mdash; cast ballots.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But new Americans will march to the polls in unprecedented numbers for two more reasons: They feel the intense heat generated by conservatives in the immigration debate, and they are Americans who have the right to vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though Republicans&rsquo; sharp-tongued immigration stance has turned off these voters, Democrats should not take them for granted, Kelley warned. The Electoral College battle is often won by slim margins in many states, and these new Americans could be this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;new and weighty&rdquo; voting bloc, she said. </p>
<p>As new voters, they do not have long-standing party loyalties and are the &ldquo;quintessential swing electorate,&rdquo; added Efrain Escobedo, of the National Association of Latino Elected Officials Educational Fund.</p>
<p>And they will be voting everywhere.</p>
<p>The swelling numbers of new voters, as well as Latinos and Asian-Americans, are no longer concentrated in traditional immigrant states such as Florida, New York and those along the U.S.-Mexico border. Their populations have expanded to states like North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada and Washington.</p>
<p>They are expected to be a force in presidential battleground states as well as in congressional contests in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Nevada, Texas, Virginia and Washington.</p>
<p>In Indiana, for example, few could have imagined until a few weeks ago that a Spanish-language radio station would be handing out pan de dulce at a get-out-the-vote rally for Hispanics. Yes, in crimson-red Indiana.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The seismic shift in the electorate will only continue, said Paral, who estimated that half of California&rsquo;s teenagers who will be eligible to vote in 2012 have an immigrant parent.</p>
<p>The challenge for future candidates is to figure out how to incorporate this emerging voting bloc into the political mainstream, said Frank Sharry, executive director of America&rsquo;s Voice, an immigrant advocacy group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the parties don&rsquo;t adapt to that, they are going to be on the wrong side of history,&rdquo; Sharry said.<br>

			<p>Governor Palin finally told a wee bit of the truth; I wonder if Senator McCain approved that message. As the article makes clear, though Palin did not mention it, this election is about race. It is about Hispanics (i.e., mestizos) and blacks voting against whites, and by extension, the historically white nation that is America. This already is a civil war, though it is being waged by ballot rather than bullet. </p>

			<p>For the millionth time, Gebe Martinez and others spreading false information. It&rsquo;s &#8220;illegal immigrants&#8221;, when you mentioned &#8220;mostly hispanics&#8221; not immigrants. They haven&rsquo;t the slightest right to be here. Americans with integrity will never back down to you liers.</p>

			<p>Economic collapse is our ally.  BHO is in the pay of Wall Street, but his fans hate capitalists almost as much as they hate self-respecting Whites.  He may have a hard time bailing out the financiers.  In any event, he could only postpone the inevitable.   And when the money wizards can or will no longer prop up this hollow economy, when they join their fat bank accounts overseas, the U.S. might soon resemble 1922 Germany, with a lot of racial division added.  All the false compassion of liberals will disappear they find themselves competing with minorities who have no love for Whites.  If you have no useful, practical skills, learn one.  Most college grad liberals are helpless without someone to do the physical labor they disdain.  When you&rsquo;re in a lifeboat, people who won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t pull an oar go over the side.  WN should all know how to row, so we don&rsquo;t have to swim.  There are still probably 100 million good Whites folks in this country, plenty enough to sustain a healthy, vibrant culture, once we are rid of the cancers among us.  </p>

			<p> We&rsquo;ve lost our country, simple as that . What was it Ted Kennedy said in &#8216;65 ? &#8220;That the effect of the new immigration bill should be negligible ?&#8221; His treachery should never be forgotten, not by real Americans . By the way, I live in south Georgia, in the sixties some of our favorite night time AM stations were WOWO Fort Wayne, WYKYZ Cincinnati,WLS Chicago . It was all so red,white and blue, mom and apple pie . Now look what we have . I am stunned . I go in the grocery store and there are almost no whites working there . They even have a Latino checkout girl, if you are white you&rsquo;ll never get a thank you out of her . This is all so WRONG! So unfair to those Americans who have been here since Colonial and Frontier times . Who literally have the same DNA as the Founders .</p>

I was clicking through the channels and I paused on Fox News, The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor. Geraldo Rivera was ranting that the reason McCain and the Republicans did so badly with Hispanics is that the Republicans vilified Hispanics.</p>

- This is by far the most clearest evidence that Ted Kennedy who was the sponsor of the 1965 immigration act is the biggest domestic enemy that whites have ever had in the history of this country. This man is responisble for the destruction of the America that we all knew and loved. If I had my druthers I would say that I curse his soul to hell. </p>

<p>Yes, and by this time next year they&rsquo;ll be handing out Greyhound tickets at a get out of the country rally, because there;s no jobs to be had.</p>
<p>Notice these rabble are always projecting higher numbers for themselves and when the are forced to leave for lack of work, they&rsquo;re whining hysterically about how every place looks like a ghost town.</p>
<p>It;s been said often enough, but it is true nonetheless that the best thing to happen to this country is the ongoing economic meltdown, and the projected downward spiral all the way into 2009 when it&rsquo;s supposed to be far waorse than now.</p>
<p>But if Obama gets elected, forget about a quick recovery.  We&rsquo;ll be struggling back from a stock market in the 5000 range, with the danger always present of a severe depression.</p>
<p>If I were the Mexes handing out anything, I think I&rsquo;d wait awhile before I danced on the death of honky traditions and culture.</p>

			<p>In other words, America will become the 3rd world. Does anyone honestly think Jose from Mexico, Mohammad from Pakistan and Dung Ho from Vietnam are going to care about American principles, the Founding Fathers or anything else American??? The answer is no, they come here solely for economic reasons only and they come in such large numbers, they don&rsquo;t have to assimilate. They don&rsquo;t see themselves as American and they will vote only according to their own racial interests. </p>

			<p>The real Americans are the founders of the Uniter States. The ones who were the first citizens allowed by law. The ones who created the consitution. The ones that started the American revolution. The ones that won America from sea to shining sea. The ones that made America great with innovations, inventions, and gave America its name and laws.</p>
<p>The real Americans are white Americans, not Mexicans or blacks.</p>

<p>There is a lesson to be learned from these people! if it wasn&rsquo;t for so many stupid whites on the Obama wagon (especialy stupid, young, white girls) the outcome wouldn&rsquo;t be in such doubt (IF there is doubt)</p>

			<p>The &#8220;real&#8221; America is an invaded nation, one being colonized by criminals who break into our country then go on to commit many other crimes. Our enviroment is suffering as well as our social services. Our schools are overflowing with non-English speaking students that our government, in its infinite wisdom, thinks we should educate. Those who produce one baby after another are reward with citizenshp for their offspring, who in turn will be able to bring in the rest of his/her enormous family. Our prisons are full, and our neighborhoods deteriorating. Our leaders also approve of another language by putting all document in Spanish and the invaders can get anything they desire without ever learning English because we provide translators. They can march, waving the flags of foreign countries and demand the rights of legal citizens. All with the blessings of our elected officials. If they had only enforced our laws and had the backbone to say, &#8220;no mas!&#8221; we would not have this tragedy. If they had to give our country away, couldn&rsquo;t it have been to a worthy opponent rather than a third world vile and violent nation?</p>

			<p>It is truly time for White America to stand up for White America!</p>
<p>Ever since Ted Kennedy opened up our gates to the Third World, we&rsquo;ve been sinking.  Diversity is not strength.  Diversity is simply the celebration of all foreign cultures and the denial of our own.  Diversity is death for White America.</p>
<p>Thanks to radio talk shows and the internet (which the Democrats can&rsquo;t wait to shut down through their so-called &#8220;Fairness Doctrine&#8221;)and just simply seeing what&rsquo;s around us, more and more of us, the founding peoples of this country, are realizing that we&rsquo;ve been bamboozled for all of these years.  We&rsquo;ve been lied to - Big Time! - for over forty years!  Our government, bankers, media, academia have all been working hand-in-hand to open our borders and enhance &#8220;free trade&#8221; all for the sake of big profits for the &#8220;elites&#8221; while the rest of us starve!</p>
<p>We are losing more and more of our freedoms each day.  We are being taxed more and more in order to support all of these anti-American minorities and illegal border-crossers.  We are losing our quality of life, our heritage, our culture, our religious beliefs and principles, and on and on and on&hellip;  </p>
<p>Our ever-growing government is taking more from us each and every day and giving us nothing but grief and misery in return.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to get back to the Constitution and the rule of law, and it&rsquo;s time to take our government back!</p>
<p>We the People must prevail or sink.<br>

			<p>This Anchor Baby phenomena should long ago have been prevented by immigration reform legislation. Seek into this country illegally or overstay a visa long enough to have a baby and you&rsquo;re nearly in, or go back home with your American anchor baby and come back later if you need to. Lots of foreign women every year come to the USA in the late months of pregnancy to establish an anchor baby. It works – democrat politicians get a lot of voters that way. Try to change this and you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;racist&rdquo;.</p>

			<p>The European nation   &mdash;   predominantly German, English, Dutch and Scandinavian   &mdash;   that created a great society from nothing here in the Americas has its own culture and heritage.</p>
<p>The rising immigrant nation has another.</p>
<p>Outnumbered liberals used demographics as a weapon against the rest of us.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not just immigrants. Its the immigrants from the lowest strata of Third World countries (like Mexico) that upset the already ailing socio-demographic composition of the American society.</p>
<p>Before Johnson and the disastrous bills that he signed into the law in 1960ties, America were inching towards classless, affluent society.</p>
<p>Now we are moving closer and closer to the point where Bolshevik revolution may turn history back to the Malthusian era (which so many morons call &#8220;progress&#8221;).</p>
<p>All among us who were tolerating the influx of unassimilating immigrants that were so good at replicating their failed cultures on American land should take the blame for this set back.<br>

   This writer is a fool if he really believes that the Hispanic vote is the difference in this election. White Americans in Iowa started Obama&rsquo;s roll and Whites will be the ones that elect him if it happens. <br>
   Gabe thinks that he is a member of a new and powerful group of brown people and that he is their spokeshole. What the fool doesn&rsquo;t grasp is that White Americans will only be pushed so far and then there will be hell to pay.</p>

The neocons and socialists and religious diversitarians firmly believe that once these people have been  indoctrinated in &#8220;American values&#8221; and democratic traditions, they will join the &#8220;Proposition Nation&#8221; and become good Americans and (just as in any fairy tale) everyone will live happily together forever after.  Sure!    Just as the French believe (contrary to all evidence) that Africans and Arabs can be transformed into good Frenchmen.  Just as Norwegians believe that Somali tribesmen and bandits can become good Norwegians!  But this utopian notion is no more than a starry-eyed belief   &mdash;   a mere gamble   &mdash;   based solely on  unfounded assumptions, which socialists and their ilk accept (religion-like)  as revealed &#8220;truth&#8221; and beyond questioning.  (And they&rsquo;ll put you in prison if you do question it.)</p>
<p>Most of these disparate peoples who are coming to us from around the world couldn&rsquo;t even get along with their own kind and neighbors back home.  That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re coming here.  So how long will this racial menagerie, with all their conflicting cults and customs, get along with each other once inside our borders?  For the time being, they are still new  and  are distracted with getting established;  and for the moment their common  (though undeclared) enemy  is the White Man &hellip; the whites who have everything they want   &mdash;   wealth and power   &mdash;    the same whites who have bent over backwards to do them so much good.  But when the whites have been dis-established and are a mere minority, who will hold the country together?  How long before these sundry races and religions turn on each other?  Who will keep them apart?  </p>
<p>In the future,  get ready to see all the hatred and conflicts of the Third World brought right to our doorsteps. Coming soon to a neighborhood near you!</p>

<p>&#8220;White Americans in Iowa started Obama&rsquo;s roll and Whites will be the ones that elect him if it happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Truer words were never spoken.</p>
<p>Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire are over 95 percent White (non-Hispanic) and hold 11 electoral votes between them. They are all pro-Obama. </p>
<p>Iowa is over 92 percent White with 7 electoral votes. They&rsquo;re pro-Obama too.</p>
<p>Minnesota and Wisconsin are over 87 percent White with 20 electoral votes. Pro-Obama.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is over 84 percent White. 21 electoral votes. Pro-Obama.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 59 electoral votes for Obama in states with overwhelming White majorities.</p>
<p>Even Connecticut, Michigan, Washington, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts have White populations of 77 percent to 83 percent. They hold 58 electoral votes between them. All are pro-Obama.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine why any rational White person would select an African to lead him/her. I can only surmise that the vast majority of people in those states have absolutely no experience with Blacks, save those who live in metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>McCain isn&rsquo;t someone Whites can really rally around anyway, with his &#8220;maverick&#8221; stand in favor of amnesty for illegals.</p>
<p>As I write this, ABCNews just declared that Obama leads by 9 points, 53 to 44, and almost no one is undecided now. Of course, they&rsquo;re always right, as we know. </p>
<p>I would like to think they only polled downtown New York City and Detroit. In reality, they could easily have polled only lily-White Vermont and Maine and achieved the same results. Disgusting.</p>
<p>Where do we turn when our own people are content to lie down and surrender America to undesirables?</p>

			<p>Hispanics love to &#8220;spread the wealth around.&#8221;  Just take a look at Chavez down in Venezuela.  When the US is 70% poor brown and 30% rich white (in about 25 years at this rate), &#8220;spreading the wealth around&#8221; will just mean &#8220;taking white people&rsquo;s property for the oppressed brown people&#8221; (a la Zimbabwe).  This is no joke.  It is the inevitable result of our immigration policies and the ever-expanding reach of the federal government.</p>

<p>You talk like a neo-con. And I totally disgree with your assessment of Sarah Palin; it&rsquo;s not based on facts but on perception materfully doctored by the semi-treasonous mass media. </p>
<p>Besides, there is a serious flaw/deception in your &#8220;logic&#8221;.</p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t electing the president and the vp from the pool of all eligible individuals in the nation. We have been restricted in our choices to those who already are on the ballot.</p>
<p>What, in your concerned mind, is a better choice now?</p>
<p>Are you trying to help Obama and his militant anti-white neo-socialists win?<br>

			<p>The real face of America is represented by those who belong to the same race as the Founding Fathers.  However, if Whites are content to remain hypnotized by the mainstream media and stupefied by television the faces of our white Founding Fathers will metamorphose into the faces of Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims and Chinese and this is all future our generations will be taught by their Marxist overlords.  </p>
<p>All that is required for this to happen is for us to do nothing.  I, for one, intend to fight while others wring their hands and complain because they lack the courage of their convictions&hellip;</p>

<p>Almost every extended White family I know has non-Whites as part of their family now. You can&rsquo;t even talk about race anymore with these people. </p>

			<p> To show you how bad the changing face of America is just take a look at Virginia. They haven&rsquo;t voted democratic since 1964, but they will on Tuesday. It&rsquo;s because of the changing demographics of Northern Virginia. Some of these red states will turn blue permanently because of the exploding population of minorities and immigrants. All the dems need is a couple of red states to turn blue to guarantee a democratic president for the foreseeable future. Once a state turns blue theres no going back, I believe.</p>

 <br>
Erik the Red is right. And to A Reader; How can Erik sound like a Neocon here ???? He is condemning them, if you read his post. The fact is, while there are many trolls flooding the web with anti-Palin messages, just because someone points out her lack of experience doesn&rsquo;t make him a &#8220;leftie&#8221;. The fact is, saying she would make a great VP because she has a bunch of kids, belongs to a church, or is a &#8220;hockey mom&#8221; like many on this site have done does not make her even remotely good for her post. How is this any different than the college girls and liberal lemmings who rave over Obama because he is &#8220;handsome&#8221;, or a good speaker ? Even if Obama were those things(which I think he isn&rsquo;t by a long shot), they don&rsquo;t make any more fit for office.  <br>
 <br>
Anonymous at 4:38 asks who Erik is really voting for,implying he is an Obama supporter. Just a little reminder, not everyone here is pulling the lever for one of the two system-approved candidates this election. The lesser of two evils is still evil. </p>

Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that.  One poster calls him a lefty. Another poster calls him a neo-con.   In fact, I can&rsquo;t figure out where he&rsquo;s coming from or what he&rsquo;s trying to say. I concluded he&rsquo;s drunk. His post was a mystery to me.

			<p>&#8220;The European nation  &mdash;  predominantly German, English, Dutch and Scandinavian  &mdash;  that created a great society from nothing here in the Americas has its own culture and heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>posted by Chris Stevens at 11:53 AM</p>
<p>Yes, it does. However, I must say there is something inherently flawed with it. As a southern European, I can see that your culture and heritage has turned against itself. Too many Anglos or Saxons are suffering from this lack of racial pride and have meekly accepted the hypocritical labels foisted upon them through academic and media propaganda. While it is repugnant, one must still blame WASPs for falling victim to this treachery-to become so unconscioulsy self-loathing of things &#8216;white&rsquo;. <br>
One should look at the Latin colonials who created empires in South America to see the diference. One would never see such deference to feral blacks there. Blacks to this day are little better than identured slaves, and rarely lash out at the European or Mestizo middle classes the way they do in USA. This speaks volumes of the diference in mentality and ethnic pride between Latin Europeans and Anglo-saxons. Until Anglo-saxons regain a love and pride for their own unique heritage, they will remain victims to every non-white who invades thier nations. <br>

<p>Yep.   At about this time in another day,  it looks like  America is going to have its first &#8220;black&#8221; president.  All thanks to our own lazy fools and  sappy traitors.  Whitey brought it al on himself.  Well &hellip; Erica Jong, Jane Fonda, and Naomi Wolff can put aside their Valium pills. They&rsquo;ll be ecstatic.

<p>Those whites are spoiling their future generations having children with &#8220;exotic&#8221; women or men. Genes in white people are recessive so this unique genotype will be lost forever. First humans living in Africa had dark skin but after thousand of years white skin appeared in Europe. Why? Under darker skies in high latitudes pale skin absorbs more sunlight than dark skin, allowing ultraviolet rays to produce more vitamin D for bone growth and calcium absorption. Dark skin is only an advantage in Africa and in equatorial latitudes where the sun is intense all the year.</p>

<p>The other day I was with my kids somewhere and a white man with his white/mestizo kids started talking to me.  He made a point to show me his kids and seemed to have much pride in them.  I thought he was pathetic if he thinks they&rsquo;re exotic when they look so common.  My little kids stand out in a crowd of mestizos.   I felt much pride in showing him my 2 good looking white kids with white skin, dark hair and light eyes.  Someday he will lament what he has done while I will be justified in my choice.</p>

			<p>Diversity isn&rsquo;t going anywhere.</p>
<p>What could be changed is the perpetual slide of the white population not only here but in Europe.</p>
<p>The problem is most Caucasians got to sucked into the materialistic culture which puts &#8220;having a flatscreen&#8221; ahead of raising a family.  This drop in family values can only be blamed on ourselves.</p>
<p>The upper middle class lifestyle always was somewhat of a mirage.  Don&rsquo;t worry about jobs going overseas.  Don&rsquo;t worry about our kids not learning math.  Don&rsquo;t worry that their aren&rsquo;t many white kids.  </p>
<p>Maybe by becoming an embattled minority caucasians will gain the determination and vitality that other groups now enjoy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, most white kids today know more about other cultures than they do their own.</p>
