<h1>A McCain &lsquo;Win&rsquo; Will Be Theft, Resistance Is Planned</h1>
									<div align="left">
						<i>David Swanson, MCW News, October 20, 2008</i></font> 
					</div>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>If your television declares John McCain the president elect on the evening of November 4th, your television will be lying. You should immediately pick up your pre-packed bags and head straight to the White House in Washington, D.C., which we will surround and shut down until this attempt at a third illegitimate presidency is reversed.</p>
<p>A McCain &#8220;win&#8221; will not be illegitimate because I disagree with his policies, but because he himself has rendered it illegitimate. He and his campaign and allied supporters have sought to illegally remove hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls, fraudulently registered people as Republicans without their knowledge and against their will, obstructed voter registration drives, falsely warned students against voting where they attend school, falsely accused community groups of voter registration fraud, falsely alleged the widespread existence of voter fraud, and encouraged supporters to falsely believe McCain&rsquo;s opponent is a foreign terrorist through speeches, recorded phone messages, and flyers. Already in early voting in a number of states there have been cases of votes on electronic machines visibly flipping to McCain or McKinney when intended for Obama. We will see McCain supporters on November 4th challenging people&rsquo;s right to vote, seeking to force people to vote on provisional ballots, and seeking to have provisional ballots discarded. And we will see electronic vote counts wildly out of step with the most recent polls, although not with exit polls &mdash; which we will be denied any access to unless they have been &#8220;adjusted&#8221; to match the official counts.</p>
<p>Inciting your supporters to violence with racist and religious lies about your opponent, effectively alleging treason on absolutely no basis, should be enough, alone, to disqualify a campaign for the presidency of the United States. Working to block voters from registering should be enough on its own. Any of the dozens of creative forms of vote suppression currently being used by the Republicans should be enough. And allowing votes to be counted on completely unverifiable machines owned and controlled by corporations allied with your party should make the results illegitimate even if plausible. If McCain is declared the &#8220;winner,&#8221; it will not be plausible, but at this point he has so disgraced himself and our electoral system that he is no longer a legitimate candidate for president regardless of what the polls (themselves fallible, but all we&rsquo;ve got) say just before election day. Too many people have already been denied the opportunity to even push the buttons and have their votes miscounted. Too much incendiary slander has been let loose. Too much visible vote flipping has already been documented.</p>
<p>If Obama officially wins, McCain is likely to challenge it, charging the Obama campaign with some of the very crimes engaged in by McCain himself. Our reaction should be exactly the same in the event of a McCain challenge as in the event of a McCain &#8220;victory.&#8221; We should not sit back for even a split second and wonder how it will work out. We should not try to organize a plan on the spur of the moment to travel to key battleground states. We should be prepared already to immediately travel to Washington, D.C., head straight for the White House, occupy Lafayette Square Park, the Ellipse, and surrounding streets, block entrances, and shut the place down until Obama is recognized as the president elect or we are guaranteed a credible election with universal registration and hand-counted paper ballots.</p>
<p>We may be there for days or weeks or months. But we must be there. We must be there by the millions. We must show each other, and the nation, and the world that we have had enough, that we will not stand for one more stolen election, that we will not give in to fear, lies, theft, and intimidation. If they choose to attack our nonviolent gathering of citizens, let them do it right in front of George W. Bush&rsquo;s White House with the world&rsquo;s media watching. We will not back down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hoping it comes to this, of course. If it doesn&rsquo;t because the official election results are credible and just, we should celebrate and prepare to lobby our government for real change. But if resistance does not develop because people are too scared and obedient to act, then you&rsquo;ll still be glad you packed ahead of time, and you might want to look into tickets to Canada.<br>

			<p>David Swanson&hellip;..Threats do not work in this country. If you are disappointed with the election results, I hope you decide to take the law in your own hands. Many people like myself will be there too and you won&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Why wait? Do it.</p>

			<p>And if Obama wins should conservatives burn down their own neighborhoods in protest and then sit back and wait for the Feds to rebuild?  Liberals and progressives are too busy sniffing glue to make much sense these days.  Ignore them.</p>

			<p>Actually, it is the Obama camp that is stealing the election right now.  My brother called my husband last night about a conversation he had had with a friend of his. His friend is not political, but he was furious about what had happened the last Sunday. </p>
<p>He went to pick up his dad in Leighton, Alabama. Across from where his dad lives, is a large predominantly African-American church. Usually on Sunday it is packed, but this particular Sunday it was not, there were only a few cars there. While waiting for his dad, he saw one of the members and spoke to him, he asked what&rsquo;s going on, where is everybody? </p>
<p>The church member told him that everyone had gone to Ohio to vote. My brother&rsquo;s friend was stunned. It&rsquo;s certainly known that people from other states are going to Ohio and voting, but this guy had no problem telling this information. I truly believe they fear no persecution for this and the Supreme Court paved the way for more and more fraud to happen. It is maddening to just have to sit back and watch Ohio be stolen.</p>

			<p>Now this is the kind of guy the SPLC and the ADL (not to mention the FBI) should be monitoring. If McCain does beat the racist it is people like David Swanson who will start hatching and spreading the conspiracy theories that lead to hate crimes and racist violence against our people.</p>

			<p>He&rsquo;s just an out of touch boob who can&rsquo;t relate to anyone who is normal. Don&rsquo;t worry about him. Maybe if Mr Swanson didn&rsquo;t listen to the same marxist friends over and over. It&rsquo;s one thing to not be able to convince us with one page, but he can&rsquo;t even convert the people who read it all, every word. Sad.</p>

			<p>How can anyone who can reason read this stuff and not think that this the natural progression of the diversity insanity we have been fed for the last forty years? These types of stories convince me that we as a society are past the tipping point and that there is no turning back to the america I knew in the 1950&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m sure it will be interesting, but it is all so sad, and it needn&rsquo;t have been. It&rsquo;s clear however, that we are descending into a multi-racial hell.</p>

I was listening to local black radio today and there was a commercial that asked the question, &#8216;what are you doing Nov. 4th&rsquo;. A voice responded, &#8216;voting&rsquo;. The first voice asked, &#8216;no after you vote?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The commercial was for an &#8216;After the Vote Party&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Blacks are going to congregate on election night. Win or lose will determine the outcome of their get togethers.</p>

			<p>I think that if somehow Obama loses it will push alot of these leftists over the edge.  There has been alot of talk from the most unhinged among them about attacking &#8220;racists&#8221; and the like.  Only the most hardcore marxists would actually consider doing anything like the unhinged lefty who wrote this implores them to do.  The bulk of Obama&rsquo;s supporters ie. blacks and college age kids will eventually lose interest and move on to the next media sensation.</p>

<p>Have fun with the port-a-potties, among other things. </p>
<p>From the nature of David Swanson&rsquo;s juvenile rant, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like he&rsquo;s given much thought to logistics.</p>
<p>The sanctimonious, morally vain, temper tantrums of leftie multicult libtard types never cease to provoke a sense of wonderment, at least for me. How can such people reach adulthood with such a diminished aptitude and appreciation of the logistics of what such a feat would entail?  </p>

<p>Well I hate to be blunt, but if you and your fellow oddballs are there by the millions you&rsquo;re going to get your asses kicked by the millions. Your entire movement consists of some of the biggest sissies on planet earth.  In fact, you&rsquo;re all so effeminate I&rsquo;m ashamed to have you as part of the white race.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask and having a hissy fit, biting and scratching, puts you in the realm of wimps who think that&rsquo;s the way to appear macho.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t anymore want people like these idiotic whites a part of my country than I want black thugs from the urban areas, and I&rsquo;ll fight as hard to have them excluded by any means necessary as I will to eliminate the blacks.  They&rsquo;re both disgusting to the nth degree.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not worrying or getting involved in this farce of an election. I hardly care. Neither candidate represents me or my interests.  They were not picked by me or by people like me. The outcome is unpredictable, except for the assured fact that it will be a disaster for us either way. It&rsquo;s impossible to say which way will ultimately prove worse. But since it&rsquo;s beyond my control, I&rsquo;m not worrying about it. What will happen will happen, that&rsquo;s all. I may vote third party or not at all. And there are better things to do on Election Eve than watch the boob tube. I have more useful things for my time    &mdash;   like mow the grass or do the laundry.</p>

			<p>In other words, this person is calling for violence.  Really, I don&rsquo;t blame him as much as I do the mainstream media, which can do nothing these days but promulgate the agitprop that Obama is inevitable.  The media are trying to provoke riots in the case of an Obama defeat.</p>

<p>Obama knows he&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t win the election with his current support base: racist blacks and some naive guilty whites who are voting for him only becuase of his skin color, loony left wingnuts who are drooling at the chance Obama offers to &#8220;re-educate conservatives&#8221;, and the elite limousine liberal MSM wolfpack, whose inevitable demise can only be averted if Obama wins and they become the official state propoganda organ. </p>
<p>Obama and his coterie know he cannot possibly win because he can&rsquo;t close the deal with his party base. They all know that the Democrat party is now hopelessly divided because of the still seething anger of the multitudes of former Hillary supporters and because of the large numbers of Reagan Democrats, none of whom will ever vote for Obama. On the other hand, they can clearly see that the Republican base is motivated as never before. </p>
<p>So the Obama cabal turns to their long-time ally, ACORN, and directs them to step up their cynical efforts to submit fraudulent Dem voter registrations. ACORN, who has been at this for over a year already, suddenly goes into a frenzy and brazenly submits millions of fake registrations. ACORN doesn&rsquo;t care that many of these registrations will be caught and discarded by the authorities   &mdash;   they know many of them will get through to be counted. And in this case, it&rsquo;s not fraudulent votes that ACORN wants counted, it&rsquo;s the fake registrations themselves. You see, the idea is simply to inflate the number of Democrat voter registrations. </p>
<p>Next, the pollsters say, Wow, look at all these new Dem registrations   &mdash;   there&rsquo;s obviously going to be a lot more Democrats than Republicans voting this time! We better re-weight our polling samples to compensate. They do so, and the re-weighted polls then naturally show Obama ahead, some more than others. Newsweek&rsquo;s latest poll, for example, has a full 11% difference favoring Democrats in their weighting. Coincidently, the same Newsweek poll shows Obama winning by 11 percent. The actual difference recorded in 2004 was zero   &mdash;   39% Democrat, 39% Republican. </p>
<p>Carville, Mathews, Oberman, and the rest of the MSM report on these polls and then start saying, Jeez, if Obama loses the election while the polls show him winning by this much, there&rsquo;s gonna be riots! Why would they say this? Could it be that they know Obama is going to lose? </p>
<p>Meanwhile, at McCain/Palin rallies, where each crowd is more huge than the last, Obama and the MSM plant fake agitators to shout violent, anti-Obama soundbites. Or not.</p>
<p> Whether or not the soundbites are really heard at the McCain/Palin rallies is irrelevant, the MSM is nevertheless directed by Obama to report that McCain supporters are losing control and calling for violence against Obama. </p>
<p>Obama and the MSM then lambast the McCain/Palin campaign for the increasingly violent nature of their supporters   &mdash;   these Republicans are really getting more and more desperate because the polls show McCain is losing badly, the MSM reports. At Obama rallies, where the crowds are steadily dwindling, Obama gets what&rsquo;s left of his supporters all worked up about these reported threats to his Oneness, and his followers come away ready for a fight. </p>
<p>On November 4, Obama badly loses the election as he, ACORN, Gallup, and the MSM all expect&hellip; Shazam! Obama supporters begin to riot that night and the next day, carrying professionally made placards reading something like, &#8220;How Can All the Polls be Wrong? McCain Stole the Election!&#8221; Accusations will be made that evil white Republican computer hackers controlled the computers that counted votes</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Kenyan connection to this 2-step? Obama advised his cousin Odinga to use this same strategy during the recent election aftermath in Kenya when Odinga lost by 200,000 votes. I think we&rsquo;re all familiar with what happened there. Will there be as much murder and mayhem here as there was in Kenya? Will Obama be able to wrest control of the U.S. government through this strategy like Odinga did in Kenya? That remains to be seen<br>

			<p>Looks like General Powell is needed to lead the Great Marxist Revolution! Viva la Revolucion!</p>
<p>Speaking of; Lenin was well supplied with German money to carry on the Russian revolution back in 1917.  His rioters were all paid and paid well.  It was essentially a few communists and their useful idiot followers leading an army of well paid mercenary rioters.</p>
<p>Is that why Obama has 150 million dollars reserved?  Will that money be used to pay the rioters?  How much of that money has been contributed by Soros.</p>
<p>The German government and Warburg bank funded Lenin&rsquo;s revolution.</p>
<p>Soros alone can fund Obama&rsquo;s.  And all Soros money was obtained through crooked, criminal  stock and financial market manipulations.  Why haven&rsquo;t the governments he nearly bankrupted gone after him?</p>

Like I&rsquo;ve been saying for a month now - the bogus, wildly-inflated margins for Obama garnered by over-sampling Dems in the MSM polls are (partly) designed to serve as setup for an &#8220;insurrection&#8221; in case of an Obama loss. </p>

Wow!  There is something  disturbingly hysterical and shrill about this article   &mdash;   so typical of writings from the radical Left.  It seems that whenever an election doesn&rsquo;t go their way, they scream that it was &#8220;stolen&#8221;.   Sort of like a spoiled child having a tantrum when he doesn&rsquo;t get his way. We heard that same screaming the last couple of times too. It&rsquo;s getting  tiresome.  Many blacks believed it passionately before (that the election was &#8220;stolen&#8221;); and they certainly will this time!   </p>
<p>I am neither of the Right nor of the Left, but I cannot for a moment sympathize with this one-sided point of view.  Any election they lose is immediately pronounced  &#8220;stolen&#8221;. It&rsquo;s similar to saying:  &#8220;Heads I win, tails you lose&#8221;.  Taking over the White House and shutting down the government?  What he is describing here is  a riot, a mob, an insurrection.</p>
<p>Ever heard of the Bonus Army?  Read about it.  There you had a  peaceful, legitimate, attempt to petition the government for a just cause  (veterans&rsquo; pay).  Still,  this group of shabbily treated WWI veterans was charged  by troops with fixed bayonets, gas and cavalry!  There were deaths incurred.  </p>
<p>This radical rabblerowser  is  already preparing and looking for trouble in advance.  He deserves worse than what the Bonus Army got.  I won&rsquo;t be there!<br>

			<p>Yup, last count I saw was more than 800 Christian churches burned down (zero Mosques even touched), more than 1000 people hacked to death with Luo machetes or burned alive in Christian churches, and more than 100,000 Kenyans displaced by the Odinga goon squads. And Raila Odinga&rsquo;s mantra for his unsuccessful election campaign was &hellip; wait for it &hellip; CHANGE! He emphasized he was Kenya&rsquo;s Hope, for Change. Of course, murder and mayhem are certainly a change, even though Odinga was arrested for bloody revolutionary activities in the 80&rsquo;s. He chanegd his mantra from revolution, to &lsquo;Change&rsquo;. Kenyans rejected the deceit anyway.</p>

Kenya was a dress rehearsal for what will happen when Obama loses.</p>
<p>Obama has his own separate campaign offices, separate from the Dem party. In many states his campaign workers are thugs from the cities, paid by the huge influx of cash Obama has accumulated.</p>
<p>These thugs at the Dem convention harassed,intimidated and alienated Hillary supporters to the point that PUMApac.org was created. Intimidation will be the order of the day at a lot of polls across the country.</p>
<p>In addition Obama has selected his own electors in each state, a process usually left to the state Dem party apparatus.</p>
<p>All of these factors point to a separate organization which is disciplined,orgnized with phone lists and a call out plan, and they have enough lefty moonbats who are perfectly willing to be cannon and riot fodder.</p>
<p>Remember those thugs who were intercepted by police in Minneapois-Saint Paul near the Republican convention, with all sorts of riot gear and such? This type of thing has been organized nationally.</p>
<p>I bet the molotov cocktails are being poured as we speak.</p>
<p>I hope the National Guards in each state have intel on this stuff. They will need much more equipment than they usually take to incidents of civil disorder.And they will in some places likely need live ammunition, lots of it. </p>
<p>It does not look pretty. <br>

			<p>I recall a family vacation in the 1960&rsquo;s where we passed through NYC on the expressway. Cops were stationed on every overpass. Apparently during the height of unrest the rioters were tossing bricks off the overpasses at passing below.</p>

dismiss those who aren&rsquo;t enlightened as they obviously are.<br>
It isn&rsquo;t that they are going to go riot (although I&rsquo;m sure theres a few black clad anarchists ready to go do that in Pioneer Sq) its more like they will just pout and ooze contempt at those of us who disagree. </p>

			<p>Obama is going to win, I do not like it, but that seems to be reality,baring some unforeseen event. If you are one of those who have not been brainwashed by the most biased MSM blitz I have ever seen in my life, sit back and enjoy Obama getting humiliated. The guy has never made an important decision or stand in his life. He will be exposed for the amateur that he is. If he was white, we would not even be having this conversation. People will actually get to see him in action, not running his mouth, flipflopping, crying racism, or phony talking points. Obama will be in front of the world and exposed. If our media says nothing, you can believe media in other countries will. Putin is licking his chops right now, because he knows McCain would have been a tougher opponent. Just think, when Obama starts jacking up taxes and shutting up opponents, he will be seen by the middle voters he wooed for what he really is,all style, no substance. Substance lasts, style wears off. Do not be surprised to see MSM turn on him at some point. They helped create the monster and, if history is any indicator, will eventually try to tear down the creation. Obama&rsquo;s flame will wear out, just watch. His actions will do what years of campaigning against him could not. </p>

<p>sounds good.  Most of the DC police force, city employees, park and capitol police are black.  At least half the federal employees are black.  They will be out rioting in the streets with their brothers.  </p>
<p>Remember the Rodney King riots were whipped up in The African Methodist Episcopal church meeting by black Mayor Bradley, many fire and police department deputy chiefs and other high ranking black affirmative action civil servants.  The high ranking blacks had planned this meeting a couple weeks before the verdict.  Purpose was to gloat if the verdict convicted the police and whip up a riot if the police officers were found innocent.</p>
<p>The black dispatchers went out of their way to mis direct the police and cause chaos.</p>
<p>So I imagine all those high ranking affirmative action blacks in DC and other cities will be doing the same thing that the black elite did in the Rodney King riots.  Instigating riot and insurrection.<br>

<p>It will also be fun to watch blacks go through the motions, but actually do nothing substantial (there&rsquo;ll be a bit here and there) to prove accurate predictions and threats of rioting (they riot spontaneously, and predictions of riots naively assume blacks have the forethought to plan that far ahead)</p>

			<p>&#8220;A McCain &ldquo;win&rdquo; will not be illegitimate because I disagree with his policies, but because he himself has rendered it illegitimate. He and his campaign and allied supporters have sought to illegally remove hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls, fraudulently registered people as Republicans without their knowledge and against their will, obstructed voter registration drives, falsely warned students against voting where they attend school, falsely accused community groups of voter registration fraud, falsely alleged the widespread existence of voter fraud, and encouraged supporters to falsely believe McCain&rsquo;s opponent is a foreign terrorist through speeches, recorded phone messages, and flyers.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been saying this for a long time and am glad to see recently that other people are saying it (I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s because I said it, but because it&rsquo;s an example of what is known as a Cultural Convergence).<br>
I been saying that the Left is a virtual Swamp of Psychopathology.  The above quote is an example. They routinely project their own faults onto others, and with no visible register of nervousness or shame, like bad liars do. Bad liars are often good people gone wrong - and sometimes for reasons out of their control.  But I am convinced that the Left is simply the Politicized expression of Psychopatholgy itself. The Psychopathology <br>
comes first, Politics second. <br>
The number one symptom is an unshakable inability to admit wrong - and the corresponding need to constantly project that wrong onto others. I also firmly believe that the number purpose of Sanctimoniousness is to conceal a major defect of character.<br>
The above quote is a perfect example. The Obamanation is guilty of everything listed in the above quote.  And to attack McCain, who is the Political equivalent of a has-been Boxer brought back from the dead for the sole purpose of throwing a fight; to even try to work up a lather over this guy is proof postive they are flip flying mad.<br>
The fact is - the Power Elite is the one who has the means, and motive, to throw elections.  The Left KNOWS that this is about to happen FOR them, so&hellip;<br>
AND, to pretend that the last two elections, which probably were thrown, were victories for Conservatives!!!!!<br>
The Left is shamelessly underhanded and, well, pathologically dishonest. Which means, of course, that the RIGHT has to be that way, only worse. That&rsquo;s why the Right can not simply be The Opponent; it HAS to be THE ENEMY. Oh, and the Right includes someone like me, a life long Independent.<br>
If you would like to see an example of this go to the link below.  RFK Jr. gives an excellent speech on how to twist facts and project your own defects of character onto - the Enemy. <br>
Of course, he thought he was doing something else.</p>

			<p>I can well imagine the chimpout these people plan when Obama is actually removed from the ballot before the election.  I think there is a high probability of that happening, as anyone who has been following the Berg lawsuit knows.  Challenges to Obama&rsquo;s right to run for POTUS have been lodged in 3 states.  And there are claims of an audiotape of Michelle Obama admitting to an african reporter that Obama was adopted by his stepfather (if true, it is illegal for him to run).  That tape will supposedly be released into the public domain within 24 hours.  I find it difficult to believe that in the face of evidence like that, the judge in the Berg case would not immediately order discovery.  And the fact that Obama has not provided documentation proving his right to run, even though it&rsquo;s been months now&hellip;well, it means he almost certainly can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If that is exposed, there will be no choice but to remove him from the ballot.  Not doing so would cause the biggest constitutional crisis in our nation&rsquo;s history.</p>

			<p>This is one of my major motivations for getting out the vote for McCain. I sincerely hope for rioting and general disorder in the large (majority black) cities. It will open millions of Americans to the truth, the the races are irreconcilably different, and that we cannot survive together. We could see a major initiative to reduce the population of blacks in America. I could see myself supporting one-time reparations payments for self-deportation to the African nation of their choice. Best possible outcome for our future. Same offer to white women with mixed race children, one time payment in exchange for their citizenship. Africa should be a paradise, right? It is run by and for Africans, with exclusively black leadership. Why on earth are they still here, I wonder?</p>

<p>Capital Research Center ^ | October 21, 2008 | Matthew Vadum</p>
<p>The connection between Goldman Sachs and ACORN is admittedly weak but we thought we&rsquo;d report it anyway because it&rsquo;s interesting. The current CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, sits on the board of directors of the Robin Hood Foundation. As we reported, that foundation is funded by George Soros&rsquo;s Soros Fund Charitable Foundation and has given money to ACORN. </p>
<p>The Robin Hood Foundation gave ACORN $821,000 consisting of a $456,000 grant in 2003 and a $365,000 grant in 2004. According to guidestar.org, Blankfein, unlike fellow board member Tom Brokaw, was in fact a Robin Hood board member in the years</p>

No matter which one of these cretins wins, it will be the final nail in the coffin of the country that passed away back in the 60&rsquo;s. Both of them are facsist, marxist trotskyites,just like Bush,Bernanke and Paulson and the Russian media is laughing about it. Anyone doubting this should check out some of the columnists at Pravda Online.

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe, if Obama loses, there will be much in the way of civil discord or rioting. Blacks are simply too lazy and essentially disinterested in abstract concepts like democracy. In some ways, if there were riots, it would be a huge insult to the left and though they wouldn&rsquo;t admit it - they&rsquo;d know it.</p>
<p>However, the amount of election fraud will be unreal and the left is determined to win at all costs. The bogus polls are designed - in part - to lead McCain supporters away from voting by believing the election is lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Challenges to Obama&rsquo;s right to run for POTUS have been lodged in 3 states. And there are claims of an audiotape of Michelle Obama admitting to an african reporter that Obama was adopted by his stepfather (if true, it is illegal for him to run). That tape will supposedly be released into the public domain within 24 hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming the Berg lawsuit which you also mention in your comment is the one currently in the Federal District Court in Philadelphia. Is this correct? Which other states are involved? Also, where is your information coming from regarding the Michelle Obama audio tape? Has it been verified that her voice is truly the one on the tape and how do you know it will &#8220;supposedly&#8221; be released to the public within 24 hours. I find this fascinating and would like to see your sources. Thank you.</p>

<p>ELECTION REJECTION: NETWORK NEWS SLUMPS; VIEWERSHIP FADES<br>
Wed Oct 22 2008 07:25:40 ET</p>
<p>The Obama-McCain match-up is proving to be a lackluster election ticket for the Big 3 network news programs, according to NIELSEN MEDIA RESEARCH.</p>
<p>As the shouting from the trail and the frantic spinning from the anchor desks intensify, the audience is voting with their remotes. </p>
<p>All 3 evening news shows experienced audience drops year-to-year for the week of Oct. 13-19, 2008. </p>
<p>CBSNEWS w/ Couric shed a half a million viewers, falling from 6.4 million to 5.9 million; ABCNEWS dropped from 8.1 million to 7.6 million; NBCNEWS slumped from 8.2 million to 7.8 million. </p>

			<p>If anyone doubts that a McCain win is not going to produce rioting and looting, they must have just landed here from another planet.  </p>
<p>We all know from past experiences in this country (those of us old enough to remember) that blacks DO NOT need an excuse to riot or loot.  They just wait for the first news report of a heavy snow and all hell breaks loose and the police are told to stand there with their thumbs up their you know what and do nothing.  Hell, a few years ago in Baltimore, the stupid media announced that the snow storm was preventing emergency vehicles and police to get out on the streets.  That&rsquo;s all it took.</p>
<p>So what do you think is going to happen should the announcement come that McCain has won the election.  I care and I don&rsquo;t care that the blacks may riot.  I&rsquo;ve seen this kind of behavior from them since the 60&rsquo;s in the days after MLK was killed.  Most of them didn&rsquo;t even know the man but his death was an excuse to pluck that new sofa or TV from the local furniture store&rsquo;s window.</p>
<p>I say let them riot but it should also be understood, in no uncertain terms, that should one business be destroyed or one building or car set afire, then the police have a right to defend the city and if that means using their guns, then so be it.  </p>
<p>My father always said that if the National Guardsman, stationed in Baltimore City in the 60&rsquo;s had been allowed to use deadly force against the marauding blacks, the rioting and looting wouldn&rsquo;t have gone as far as it did.  </p>
<p>If Obama loses (and I am praying every night that he does), blacks won&rsquo;t be rioting and looting because he lost, it will only be because they&rsquo;ve had their eye on that plasma TV in the Best Buy store.</p>

			<p>No, the Republicans aren&rsquo;t gunna steal the election. But I think McCain still has a chance of winning this thing, and I think there&rsquo;s a very good chance that if he does it will be another electoral vote victory but popular vote defeat, as in 2000.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m hoping for it: that would really set the crazies off!</p>

<p>I assume you mean Suetoro.  Correct?   If so, how would that make it &#8220;illegal&#8221; for him to run?  Please be more explicit!  This is very interesting, if it&rsquo;s so, but you leave too much unexplained.</p>

			<p>Although I view McCain as the barest better of two evils&hellip; I HOPE he wins. Not just because of all Obama&rsquo;s baggage (Jeremiah Wright, Obama&rsquo;s utter lack of experience, his very questionable campaign contributors) but because I HOPE the Blacks start rioting!</p>
<p>Because it will take something like massive rioting to shake Americans out of their torpor. To understand the enemy is not just a bunch of rag wearing third-worlders 10,000+ miles away&hellip; but in our own cities!</p>

			<p>I decided that I&rsquo;m going to have to vote for McCain because I don&rsquo;t want to spend the next 4 years hearing the MSM tell us about how wonderful mulatoes and blacks are. White girls are encouraged to be with nonwhites already and we don&rsquo;t need more of that kind of propaganda.<br>

Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re going to hear it ANYWAY?  </p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t we been hearing it for years and years, under every president?   Do you think McCain is going to stop that?   Are you in a dream world? </p>
<p>(McCain doesn&rsquo;t think blacks are wonderful?  Just take a look at his own family.)</p>

			<p>I dislike McCain quite intensely because of his illegal alien amnesty vote, but I&rsquo;m still voting for him because it&rsquo;ll be great fun to hear the lefties whine about a &#8220;stolen election&#8221; for another four years.  If we&rsquo;re really lucky some of them will move to Canada.</p>
<p>I normally don&rsquo;t watch TV, but I&rsquo;ll watch after the election, because I can think of very little that would be as entertaining as watching the Secret Service beating the leaving daylights out of liberal protesters on the White House lawn.  Additionally, the spectacle of blacks burning their own neighborhoods down and being shot by national guardsmen should be quite gratifying.</p>

<p>Bush really and truly didn&rsquo;t win in 2000, and the country has been a mess ever since.</p>

			<p>&#8221; I don&rsquo;t believe, if Obama loses, there will be much in the way of civil discord or rioting. Blacks are simply too lazy and essentially disinterested in abstract concepts like democracy. . &#8220;</p>
<p>Posted by at 1:04 AM on October 22 </p>
<p>Are you kidding me?  If you are old enough, you surely remember the late 60&rsquo;s when they were rioting and looting after MLK was killed.  We had a curfew in Baltimore City and National Guardsmen stationed round the clock for weeks.  And where were you in 1992 after the trial of those 4 policemen accused in the beating of Rodney King.  Didn&rsquo;t you see television reports of LA burning?  They didn&rsquo;t even know the guy for God&rsquo;s sake but they didn&rsquo;t need to.  </p>
<p>You are correct that blacks are lazy but I&rsquo;ve seen their worse behavior and they don&rsquo;t need an excuse to destroy somebody else&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>I live in Tennessee and no near a major city, so I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll have any problems here but if people in and around the major cities are getting themselves prepared to defend themselves, their homes, their businesses and property, they&rsquo;re in for a world of hurt.<br>

			<p>I do not think for one minute that Obama is going to lose. Not that he by any means the better candidate, but he has the supporters with clout. The same sort of clout that can instantly organize every leftist in Europe into violent demonstrations as in Cologne recently, the same clout that can organize every single muzzie country to simultaneously demonstrate world-wide against a cartoon. The clout to organize every &#8220;community activist&#8221;in the states to register millions of illegal voters. And if all that still fails, we will learn that to scratch an Obama is to bring out the Luo in him as the author of this article clearly states. When his supposed cousin, Odinga, using the same methods, most likely scripted by Obama&rsquo;s team, still lost the Kenyan elections, he released on orgy of xenophobic violence not seen since the days of the Mau Mau. Never forget all his other supporters. Libya&rsquo;s Gadaffi assured an audience that Obama&rsquo;s denial of Muslim faith was nothing but a gimmick to get elected ( The Memri site has an English translation of that speech. The editorial in yesterdays Arab News from Saudi Arabia<br>
looks forward to the new &#8220;progressive&#8221; politics that are likely to come out of America after his election. Hamas has said they will be the first to send him a congratulatory telegram when he is elected. Ahmadinajad and the mad mullahs are dancing for joy.<br>
I have one very serious reservation. Do they all know something we do not? In reply to Eichman, API said this morning the Michelle tape is with Fox and their lawyers and due for release as soon as all legal aspects have been cleared.</p>

Because there are too many of us out here, that still believes in the &#8220;true&#8221; American dream of working hard for what you get, and not having it all handed to you.  You get what you sow, people, it&rsquo;s that simple.  Let these idiots be stupid enough to start a riot. We might as well get it over with!  I won&rsquo;t start a fight, but I sure as heck will finish it!  I will not live under the threat of the whine babies revolting!  NO!  All I can say is they had better rethink this tactic, because it will not work well for them, and once it starts, there is no going back.</p>

			<p>To generalquagmeyer&hellip; .</p>
<p>Quaggy, you did bring up some good points. But seriously now. What makes you think the Dems have clean hands? Historically known as the tax and spend party, they&rsquo;ll hardly be above jacking up taxes on EVERYONE. Then passing fat contracts to their friends and cronies in the commercial sector.</p>
<p>Common sense tells you that taxing the corporations will just drive MORE jobs out of the country; conversely having the corporate honchos SCREAM for more H1B visas to be issued. Since saving on wages will the the only way to cut expenses and make up for higher taxation.</p>
<p>Also I personally do not TRUST Obama. Firstly, that hidden racism of his and that of his wife. Secondly, the fact some unknown people are trying to buy control of the White House thru their stooge, Obama. Thirdly, that AFRICAN countries are contributing heavily to his campaign warchest. Trying to BUY massive influence (support) from Obama, should he win. At taxpayer expense, of course, when Obama gets Americans to support these failed African countries. </p>
<p>If those three very valid reasons are not enough&hellip; Look at Obama&rsquo;s lack of experience. Lack of any real track record. No history of really making a massive effort to support a bill, other than that obscenity of his, to &#8220;redistribute wealth&#8221; by dishing out tons of greenbacks to &#8220;have not&#8221; African countries. Something that can hardly be our fault, much less our responsibility.</p>
<p>I would remind everyone&hellip; we and our descendants have two wars to pay for. The 911 aftermath   &mdash;   clean-up, etc. The hurricane caused damage over the past half dozen years. That infamous Wall Street Bailout. So WHY in hell should we support thoese miserable African pestholes to boot?</p>
<p>Let the oil-rich Arabs help them. Or China. (Sorry, I forgot. China is helping&hellip; (themselves to slave labor, to plundering the natural resources of those countries China is &#8220;helping.)</p>

			<p>Sorry Quaggy (general quagmeyer)&hellip;</p>
<p>I also meant to point out in my prior post. . several bloody wars occurred under the Democrats. World War II might have occurred anyway. Then again, might have been changed. Something that can be argued either way, equally well. Vietnam was DEFINITELY the work of the Dems&hellip; one Lyndon Baines Johnson and his infamous Tonkin Resolution. (A purported attack by Vietnamese PT boats on an American ship   &mdash;   which had actually never happened.) Nor can we forgive Johnson&rsquo;s stand when our U.S.S. Liberty was brutally attacked by an &#8220;ally&#8221;; with 34 sailors murdered, 174 wounded. With strafing aircraft machinegunning sailors clinging to debris.</p>
<p>THINK friends, before voting Democrat. Neither party is clean. But the Dems are hardly the better of the two&hellip; unless you&rsquo;re a liberal or a fool of a voter.</p>
