				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Horowitz, New York Observer, Oct. 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It seems that the final days of the presidential campaign have made Erica Jong and her friends more than a little anxious.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Jong, the author and self-described feminist, gave an <a href="https://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/ottobre/29/Follett_Jane_Fonda_liberal_americani_co_9_081029030.shtml">interview to the Italian daily Corriere della Sera</a>, the choicest bits of which were brought to my attention by the reliably sharp-eyed Christian Rocca, the U.S. correspondent of Il Foglio, who published excerpts on his Camillo blog. Basically, Jong says her fear that Obama might lose the election has developed into an &ldquo;obsession. A paralyzing terror. An anxious fever that keeps you awake at night.&rdquo; She also says that her friends Jane Fonda and Naomi Wolf are extremely worried that Obama will be sabotaged by Republican dirty tricks, and that if an Obama loss indeed comes to pass, the result will be a second American Civil War. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a translation of Jong&rsquo;s more spirited quotes to the Milan-based Corriere, as selected by Rocca. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends Ken Follett and Susan Cheever are extremely worried. Naomi Wolf calls me every day. Yesterday, Jane Fonda sent me an email to tell me that she cried all night and can&rsquo;t cure her ailing back for all the stress that has reduces her to a bundle of nerves.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My back is also suffering from spasms, so much so that I had to see an acupuncturist and get prescriptions for Valium.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>&ldquo;If Obama loses it will spark the second American Civil War. Blood will run in the streets, believe me. And it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that President Bush recalled soldiers from Iraq for Dick Cheney to lead against American citizens in the streets.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Well, with verification from such high intellects like those, it&rsquo;s no wonder she&rsquo;s worried. The only qualifying individuals she could offer with more credibility would be Yogi Bear and Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Obama loses it will spark the second American Civil War. Blood will run in the streets, believe me. And it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that President Bush recalled soldiers from Iraq for Dick Cheney to lead against American citizens in the streets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, if anybody had any doubts the first quote above came from the mind of an egghead, the second one that Dick Cheney will be leading troops in the field in house to house fighting should dispel any notions that these top notch opinions weren&rsquo;t given until an intense, deep analysis, verifying their accuracy with somebody like the esteemed Richard Simmons, was made.</p>
<p>These are the same types who ridicule the right when it lays out valid concepts with reasonable logic for a situation they believe is about to occur.</p>
<p>Keep in mind these are typical elitist Obama celebrity backers.</p>

			<p>The past week has been marked with numerous public &#8220;predictions&#8221; of violence from the left. If Follett is terrified, perhaps he should remain in his own multicultural utopia there in London and continue to write bad novels. </p>
<p>These &#8220;predictions&#8221; of violence are nothing less than a direct THREAT of violence against Whites and others who would vote for McCain.  That being said, unrest and mob violence are almost assured following the election but it will happen regardless of the outcome of the election, so Whites simply need to be prepared. </p>

			<p>What a total idiot. But then again, she always has been. And we now know for sure that she did plenty of mind altering drugs in the seventies, don&rsquo;t we. </p>
<p>I would not vote for Obama no matter what color he was. So go ahead and call me a racist. It won&rsquo;t make me change my vote.</p>

			<p>Like I said folks - they are positively Psychotic and will not stop until every last White man is dead - except the ones they know will toe the line.</p>
<p>They will not listen to reason and project every single defect that they possess onto the &#8220;other&#8221;.</p>
<p>Every single one of these hysterically irresponsible comments goes unchallenged, without debate.  </p>
<p>Russia 1918</p>
<p>USA 2008</p>
<p>These people will never allow an intelligent debate because it would be too easy to refute their position. <br>
Sadly, they are the kind of people who feel - deep in their bones - that the only way to get rid of an opinion you don&rsquo;t like, is to kill the people who hold it.  All of them.</p>
<p>The issue should be their Psycho and Socio Pathology.<br>
Not whether or not Obama wins.<br>
The fact that this is not the case tells you all you need to know about exactly where we are headed.</p>
<p>Her comment confirms what I have been thinking for years, ie; that the Left has been working tirelessly to force us into a position of having to defend ourselves so that they can slaughter us.  </p>
<p>Obama STILL can not prove he is even an American citizen. Hillary Clinton supporters have complained about intimidation at the voting booth by Obamagoons; and yet, it&rsquo;s the &#8220;Republicans&#8221; who are up to their dirty tricks.<br>
No one in their right mind would believe this for a second.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the whole point!!!!</p>

<p>Well now that&rsquo;s awfully nice to read, and I hope it&rsquo;s true, but I&rsquo;m taking Jane and Jong&rsquo;s hysteria with a little more than a grain of salt.</p>
<p>As for a second civil war, blood in the streets and, although it wasn&rsquo;t mentioned, a raising of white racial consciousness, if a thing sounds to good to be true, it probably is.   <br>

			<p>&#8220;If Obama loses it will spark the second American Civil War&#8221;. That&rsquo;s not really true. There may be some localized rioting but what will spark the second Civil War will be trouble makers like Jong and Fonda. </p>

			<p>I say this because i think it completely viable in these desperate times..</p>
<p>Its possible that this &#8220;second American civil war&#8221; may come to fruition. We face sour times indeed. We will either end up with a testament of the Marxist victory in our nation; a mulatto with a hatred of whites and a love of socialism. Or end up with yet another bush. But know this, though i feel mccain is the lesser of the two evils.. this left-leaning imbecile is right when they state that battle would be soon to come. </p>
<p>We are dealing with people who simply must get what they want at all times, or else. Often this is petty things, like a job at some fast food restaurant despite their shady background, or that new pair of nike shoes they&rsquo;re willing to steal if need be. This time, its the presidency of our country.</p>
<p>His failure may indeed spark these thugs to take up arms upon innocents. Being so i *highly suggest you arm yourselves and keep your doors locked come election day and forth on*. I mean this not to sound defeatist or over dramatizing a situation. Its a legitimate possibility that these people and their sympathizers will be out for blood, its a legitimate possibility that this lust for bloodshed would burn up into a large scale conflict.</p>
<p>Whatever the chances, it is better to be ready for the worst case scenario. By no means, do i suggest voting the cretin in out of fear, all i suggest is being ready to defend yourself and your loved ones. Some of you have long predicted that such a conflict would ensue. some of us doubted. But here we are, with a distinct possibility of a conflict very much resembling such a prediction.</p>
<p>Assume nothing, but be prepared for the racial tensions to finally boil over, and your commitment to your family and people, to be put to the test.</p>

			<p>Is it that this will happen, or that Miss Jong wants it to happen?  I think it&rsquo;s the former, and that her saying that it is going to happen is her sending subtle messages to certain people that they should attempt to start a conflagration in the happenstance of The One not winning.</p>
<p>Matt Hale is serving some 30 years in Federal prison because he said something in a similar verve about a Chicago-based Federal judge.</p>

			<p>Gee. I&rsquo;m worried and especially so since Erica Jong&rsquo;s back aches. That a sign. Psycho-sacro-iliacism is a well-known precursor to blood in the streets. Ask any acupuncturist.</p>

			<p>Civil war? No. Of course we need some day of reckoning. But I suspect that it will be far less dramatic than a civil war. In fact, I would argue that we&rsquo;ve been in a civil war since the 1960s. Just look at the devastation in Gary, Detroit, the south side of Chicago, etc. etc. for proof.</p>

			<p> Ah, yes, Ms. Jong   &mdash;   there, there, lie down, take a Valium and try to calm yourself. If anyone &#8220;steals&#8221; this election, it will be your sainted Obama and his band of merry men, who want to play Robin Hood with all our money and who have been using ACORN to gum up the electoral process for months. Republicans steal the election? Why Ms. Jong, how funny you talk! Number one, they probably aren&rsquo;t smart enough to. And number two, that would be RACIST! Don&rsquo;t you know that The Anointed One has been sent by Allah to rule over us, and that nothing can stand in his way?</p>
<p> Rest assured, Ms. Jong, if the American people manage to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by voting down the Mulatto Messiah, it will be because they came to their senses just in the nick of time   &mdash;   not because of any &#8220;stealing.&#8221; </p>

			<p>A stupid STUPID woman who got rich selling stupid &#8220;literature&#8221; to stupid people. Beyond the ignorance of her election stealing comment, just notice her acknowlegement. Africans are violent by nature, and unless they get what they want, blood will be let. Really can&rsquo;t she see the conflict of her belief and her support of the Messiah?  I ask What The Heck has happened here?</p>

<p>For anyone of sane mind, such an endorsement should be all that is required to tell them whom not to vote for.  The more worried and depressed this group of intellectual bozos, the better for the country.  As for Hanoi Jane, doesn&rsquo;t such a strong endorsement from the queen of traitors herself say at least something about her hero?<br>
With friends like these, and Ayers and Wright and the Nation of Islam, et al, how blind must any white be in order to actually vote for Obama?  I find it bordering on the incredible that any white with an IQ of 90 or above would ever even consider such a vote.  Perhaps we can all live one day in Obama&rsquo;s Marxist utopia where the likes of Jane Fonda can lecture us on being a patriot and Obama&rsquo;s goon squads, rather than being simply the various Chicago gangs, will include the US military (remember that our RINO, Bush, has already eliminated posse comitatus  &mdash;  a phrase that one would not expect Follet to understand).</p>

			<p>   If it wasn&rsquo;t for the serious nature of this story, I would be on the floor rolling in laughter. This Jane Fonda wanna-be is as communist as China. People like her are always looking for an excuse to fuel their drug addictions. This foolish old rich hag talks like the second civil war would be a bad thing for white people. It won&rsquo;t, it is the only chance we have to save ourselves. Besides, I&rsquo;m sure she has enough hired security to save her from having to get her hands dirty. Typical liberals, crying themselves to sleep. They must call on Prince Valium to keep them sane. </p>

<p>She also says that her friends Jane Fonda and Naomi Wolf are extremely worried that Obama will be sabotaged by Republican dirty tricks, and that if an Obama loss indeed comes to pass, the result will be a second American Civil War, according to Jason Horowitz in <i>The New York Oberserver</i>.</p>
<p>Pardon me why blink in amazement. I&rsquo;m trying to imagine 71-year-old (almost) Hanoi Jane, 46-year-old (almost) Naomi Wolf and 66-year-old Erica Jong in fatigues packing Uzis or AK-47s with that green and brown gunk on their faces launching an assault on, uh, whatever. </p>
<p>Remember back in the old days when liberals were pacifists?</p>
<p>First, Obama probably won&rsquo;t lose due, in part, to people like Long, Fonda and Wolf who reap the rewards of America&rsquo;s past ingenious free-market system while hypcritcally advocating big-government socialism.</p>
<p>Second, if Obama does lose McCain will be a (barely) lesser of the two evils.</p>
<p>Now, image if McCain wins and dies in office, Sarah Palin becomes the first woman president of the United States.</p>
<p>Okay! Now I can image the threesome going Charlie&rsquo;s Angels on us. A senior citizens version, of course.</p>

			<p>Wasn&rsquo;t this the crowd that all said in 2000 that they were going to move a more suiting People&rsquo;s Paradise like London or Beijing if George W. Bush won?  Seems to me like none of them have, and if they do, then they&rsquo;ll all have to roll up their magic carpets and fly somewhere else, say to Venezuela or maybe Havana, or Pyongyang, because the UK will soon install David Cameron as PM, and who knows, perhaps a mad scientist can meld W.&rsquo;s genetics with that of a Chinese man, who will then become ruler of all China.</p>

			<p>Well now, my friend, Joe the Plumber, who actually works for a living, is worried that if Obama wins he&rsquo;s going to be punished for his hard work through unfair taxation.  And he&rsquo;s also worried that if Obama loses, he (Joe the Plumber) might be gunned down in the streets by some bitter blacks simply because he&rsquo;s white and blacks will blame white racism for the loss.  So, there&rsquo;s a real dilemma.  Just go bunk up at Jane&rsquo;s house and close the gates and turn on the closed circuit TV security system.  You&rsquo;ll be alright.  (Just don&rsquo;t let any blacks in if they come knocking.)</p>

			<p>Erica Jong need not fear. America is not Kenya, where a politician who lost whipped up his tribe in a fury xenophobic violence and wholesale murder. Obama&rsquo;s tribe in the US is relatively small and not as well armed or motivated as the major tribe. Though both may be born Luos, even in Kenya the Luos have always come out second best.</p>

<p>My goodness. How girly. How hysterical. How silly. How typical. You know, as the Crazy Line gets longer, and their rants start piling up, one is driven to stop and ask, &#8220;Are they doing this on purpose?&#8221;  Do they actually WANT him to lose? It could happen. Either way, an entire generation of non-stop PC indoctrination has done nothing to make me hate myself for being White. Same with these threats about Obama losing. They aren&rsquo;t working in this case, and have done nothing to make me afraid. Disgusted, maybe even annoyed, and certainly bored to tears. But not afraid.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s loss will not spark another American Civil War.  In order for their to be a &#8216;War&rsquo; there have to be TWO sides fighting.  In the last 40 years or so it&rsquo;s only been one side fighting - and that&rsquo;s Blacks - mugging us, assaulting us, taking our jobs, molesting our women and taking our women, degrading us, etc.  A Civil War has to have two opposing sides and I don&rsquo;t believe most of our people have the stomach or the will to fight at this point in time.  Most Whites have been too conditioned to acquiesce and to bow at the alter of multi-culturalism and diversity.  They are much more likely to try and act as peacemakers - while they&rsquo;re getting killed and dying off.</p>

What I found profound in them was Homer (a liberal, albeit one who has always paid his dues) being told by his Dad(a self educated engineer who knew more about mining than all of the degree&rsquo;d engineers together) that if this country ever fell, it would be because of people like the Kennedy&rsquo;s . It was the early sixties and his statement was prophetic . I enjoyed both books and feel like I grew up in Coalwood myself . It was an adventure .

<p>The right-wing Economist just endorsed Obama. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right - THE ECONOMIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Both McCain and Obama supporers say a lot of hysterical, silly things, but in the end, Obama is (as McCain, to his credit, has said it flat out) an intelligent, reasonable CENTRIST. &amp; He will undo some of the damage done by Idiot King George II.</p>
<p>Socialist? Really? Is that why the wealthy have bankrolled him? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more concerned that Obama will sell working americans out by turning into Mr. Republican Lite.</p>
<p>Sorry guys, but American have gotten so stupid it don&rsquo;t deserve a real government.</p>
<p>Is it something in the water?</p>
<p>You people should have got it by now:</p>
<p>The US is run by a TINY oligarchy.</p>
<p>If they didn&rsquo;t LIKE mass immigration &amp; AA, it would never have happened. </p>
<p>They do this stuff to lower labor costs &amp; piss of working Americans against other losers (like blacks).</p>
<p>The left &amp; right are equally brain dead, but the best parts of each (Canadian style universal health care, end immigration &amp; quotas, no more weird enclaves of aliens - everyone in America lives and behaves like an American, cap exec. salaries, clean unions for all workers, clean up corruption across the board using a blow torch, protect the environment, teach civic values and responsible citizenship) would make a decent program. </p>

04/05/07 12:07 AM People  &mdash;   When will everyone PLEASE REALIZE and ACCEPT that ALL WHITE PEOPLE do not come from slave owners, are not from the South where nearly all white people were racists, stupid, arrogant, greedy, cruel and avaricious torturers . I am a white person, half German, half Irish. I AM NOT FROM THE SOUTH- none of my ancestors were from the South. We are from the North who fought and died in the Civil War to end Slavery.                                                  First off, Mr. Lincoln would have disagreed with you and so would have congress during that era . Secondly, in 1776 all thirteen colonies allowed slavery and all thirteen colonies had slaves . The British sought to utilize the slavery issue in exactly the same manner the Union would successfully do so  during the Civil War . Washington and Jefferson both were slave owners, so apparently the Revolution was also fought to end slavery by your logic . And last but not least ; I was going to post the demographic stats of a certain well known northern state and a certain small, well known northern town to show that their schools to this day remain overwhelmingly segregated and label it &#8220;Brown vs Board, Northern style.&#8221; But I am not going to do that because I wish that little town well and I hope and pray they can continue to remain segregated and in control of their schools and I do not want to draw attention to them and have the liberals target them, even though I am a Southerner and our school system and our culture was literally blown away by Brown vs Board . Nan, I attended a 98% white, Southern culture school in the sixties, C class- we had a music program, championship sports teams ( even though we could not even field but a little more than one football team, our guys had to play offense and defense,they had to play a B and 2B even an A class team or two schedule because C class teams were so hard to find, but they were champions .)Debate teams, Ag teams, the whole nine yards . Fall of &#8216;70, complete integration, we jumped to a 4A school, out of 120 seniors - 15 were white . I am betting you are somewhat young and have lived a lilly white existence in a defacto white enclave . And yet you have the audacity to judge others who envy you for what you have despite the fact it was liberals like you who wrecked what little they had as a people and a culture .  </p>

			<p>You all just don&rsquo;t understand, it is their lifelong work as Feminists that is on the line.  They taught Obama&rsquo;s mother to marry a man of color in order to destroy White men.  NOW ran an overt campaign on this theme for years, they delcared it.  So now, this is their chance to take the nation and begin to see the end of White men.  No wonder they are so nervous about it, a loss would seem to negate the sum total of their lifelong ambitions.</p>

			<p>elitist: As a long-time Economist subscriber, I can assure you that it is not a right-wing publication.  Many people make that mistake because it has a stodgy name and is fiscally conservative, but on balance it tends to have left-of-center views on such social issues as immigration, drug policy, and so on.</p>
<p>Earlier this year it was The Economist that disappointingly chided Italians for being worried about the hordes of gypsies and Romanian criminals flooding over their country&rsquo;s borders and clogging the Italian court system.</p>
<p>The Economist is certainly less superficial and glib than Time or Newsweek but right-wing it is not.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it.  This is another example of bullying tactics from the left, with inherent threats of riots and violence if we don&rsquo;t go along with their candidate.  If we just say no.  Has this woman no consideration of the potential dreadful effect of her words?  Thugs and violence-prone people don&rsquo;t need egging on or to be given excuses, which is what Jong has done. There are laws against crying &#8220;Fire!&#8221; in a crowded theater.  Jong has almost done that.  Utterly irresponsible woman. If violence does ensue the elections, she will have complicity in it. </p>

<p>Thank God above that these people still don&rsquo;t run the country although, they&rsquo;ve pretty much turned the country to their leftist side and with an Obama presidency, looks like they will finally get their way.  That utopia they&rsquo;ve been yearing for since Woodstock.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If Obama loses it will spark the second American Civil War. Blood will run in the streets, believe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why is that?  Because the Left demands and wants and takes, and doesn&rsquo;t mind resorting to violence.  The Right produces and creates, and would accept a loss without violence.  But make no mistake:  the Left would never want to start a Civil War, because then they might lose the Right, who supplies most of the taxes and productivity.  In fact, Jong gets it exactly wrong.  By empowering the Left, an Obama victory could lead to a civil war because the Right wants out, and the Left will not want them to opt out, and will fight it and try to barricade the exit door.  Whereas if the Left wanted out, the Right would say &#8220;don&rsquo;t let the door hit you on the way out&#8221;.<br>

			<p>From the moment I set foot on the campus of Stony Brook University (Long Island) in 1989, my prepubescent Republicanism matured quickly not only due to the intellectual climate that the Jong&rsquo;s and Wolf&rsquo;s represent on campus, but the militancy of the Black Student Union and the large volume of Asians that simply created Beijing lite. One way or the other, future civil war or conflict seemed a strong possibility. I&rsquo;m sure many of us know deep down that some struggle is likely in the near future. And, brought on by these others, we can only welcome it. Living on Long Island, under 67% white now, is not the best place. Can someone offer advice, websites, etc., where better part of the country are to move? I really can&rsquo;t raise kids here, and that part of life is coming soon, and a good job isn&rsquo;t enough. I&rsquo;ve looked at citi-data, is there any additional advice? It&rsquo;d be great to have a site that collects together data in one place for whites. </p>

<p>These are all members in good standing of our privileged elites. A tireless advocate of multiculturalism, Ms.Jong did much damage during the seventies with her book Fear of Flying, which advocated a sexually promiscuous lifestyle for women. Erica Jong has been married four different times. Evidently, the lifestyle advocated in her inferior and overrated writing doesn&rsquo;t work out well in life.</p>

&ldquo;If Obama loses it will spark the second American Civil War. Blood will run in the streets, believe me.&#8221; </p>
<p>In case Jong is ignorant of the fact, Blood has been flowing in the streets of America ever since the Great 60s Revolution started.</p>

			<p>Look one the bright side. Comrade Obama, if he wins, will merely accelerate the economic collapse put in place by the WTO/Federal reserve New World Order elites to turn the USA into a third world slum. Comrade O  &mdash;  and his friends  &mdash;  will do this openly what had been done more secretively by (nominally) White Presidents.</p>
<p>This can only make the work of White advocates and AR easier in the months ahead.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the NWO criminal-political elite was as successful as they were is because they were able to masquerade as patriots, conservatives, and traditional Americans in a way that will be much more difficult for Comrade Obama and his most vocal comrades on a thoroughly degenerate, antiwhite, anti American and Anti Christian left. The worsening state of an inflation-ridden, debt ridden, and affirmative action ridden &#8220;economy&#8221; will highlight our warnings and recommendations in a way that could never happen in the past.</p>
<p>It is true that Comrade O  &mdash;  and his fellow trolls and parrots in the lamestream media  &mdash;  will blame Bush and his neocons for a while. But the fact that we were strong critics of Bush, McCain and the &#8220;right wing&rsquo; of the NWO will laugh that objection out of court very soon.</p>
<p>Whether you vote for Barr (Libertarian), Baldwin (Constitution) or even Ralph Nader, we have some interesting days ahead of us!</p>
<p>The Chinese word for &#8220;crisis&#8221; combines the characters for &#8220;hardship&#8221; and &#8220;opportunity&#8221;. Maybe this is telling us something!</p>
<p>PEACE AND FREEDOM!!<br>

			<p>&#8220;Earth to Amren readers:</p>
<p>The right-wing Economist just endorsed Obama.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right - THE ECONOMIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by elitist at 5:03 AM on October 31&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not news, and The Economist is not by any stretch of the imagination a &#8220;right wing&#8221; magazine.  It is a classically-liberal style free-market mag that is very socially liberal.  The ideal Ecomomist reader would a gay investment banker who thinks he knows far more than he does (The Economist itself thinks it knows far more than it does - the people who write it really aren&rsquo;t all that bright).  That they are plugging for his supreme O-ness is no surprise.</p>

			<p> Dedalus said: <i>These people will never allow an intelligent debate because it would be too easy to refute their position. <br>
Sadly, they are the kind of people who feel - deep in their bones - that the only way to get rid of an opinion you don&rsquo;t like, is to kill the people who hold it. All of them<i></i></i></p>
<p>Check out this link re Obama&rsquo;s buddy Wm. Ayers, to see just how correct you are.<br>
Obama lies but no-one seems to care. The damming LA Times story puts Obama, Ayers and Dohrn together at Rashid Kalidi&rsquo;s house in 2000, hosting Obamas bid for the House.<br>
Arc.</p>

			<p>Jane Fonda is a traitor and should have been tried for treason. Her father&rsquo;s notriety and money had a lot to do with her walking, while our POW&rsquo;s were still being tortured. It makes me so angry whenever I hear her say she is a &ldquo;born again Christian.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s a Reverent Wright &ldquo;christian&rdquo;, a radical old, leftist Hollywood, dried up old hag. </p>
<p>As a long time combat veteran of Viet-Nam I dislike Hanoi Jane and while in the military I knew nothing of Democrat or Republican but Knew jane was wrong and still think so. But under the same circumstances at this very moment in history I think Nancy Pelosi and a large number of politicians have violated federal laws by visiting foreign governments, some of which are hostile to us, and they too should be stripped from their public offices and imprisoned. Perhaps a person of law could tell me if I am correct or not, please! </p>

It makes me more  convinced than ever that she is an airhead and a total wacko. <br>
I always thought she was a nutjob before. Now I  <i>know </i> so.</p>

			<p>Erica Jong always struck me as a true space cadet. Seems nothing has changed. Obviously age doesn&rsquo;t always bring wisdom.</p>

			<p>I really thought the tide had turned for Ms. Fonda when she announced that she was divorcing Ted Turner and had become a born again Christian.  However, I quickly came back to my senses when she was touring around the country with some group promoting the &#8220;V*g*na Monologues.&#8221;  Or it might have been some shirt that said &#8220;My V*g*na Votes.&#8221;  I can&rsquo;t exactly remember but it was disgusting and I don&rsquo;t think that any Christians that I know or attend church with would tour around the country promoting this type of thing.</p>
<p>However, if I was able, I would ask her what her definition of &#8220;Born Again Christian&#8221; is, because it sure isn&rsquo;t the same as mine.</p>
<p>Bottom line - the woman is a kook through and through.</p>

			<p>What this Marxist traitor forgot to mention is that an Obama win would quite likely spark a second civil war as well.  When a minority is given power over a majority that minority always and without exception abuses that power.  </p>
<p>Make ready boys, because this time it isn&rsquo;t the preservation of our union and states rights we will be fighting for; but the preservation of our way of life by cleansing the entrenched communism that has been festering in this nation for many decades&hellip;   </p>
