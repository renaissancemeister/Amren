<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5051118.ece">Barack Obama Lays Plans to Deaden Expectation after Election Victory</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Reid, Times (London), Oct. 31, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s senior advisers have drawn up plans to lower expectations for his presidency if he wins next week&rsquo;s election, amid concerns that many of his euphoric supporters are harbouring unrealistic hopes of what he can achieve. </p>
<p>The sudden financial crisis and the prospect of a deep and painful recession have increased the urgency inside the Obama team to bring people down to earth, after a campaign in which his soaring rhetoric and promises of &ldquo;hope&rdquo; and &ldquo;change&rdquo; are now confronted with the reality of a stricken economy. </p>
<p>One senior adviser told The Times that the first few weeks of the transition, immediately after the election, were critical, &ldquo;so there&rsquo;s not a vast mood swing from exhilaration and euphoria to despair&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The aide said that Mr Obama himself was the first to realise that expectations risked being inflated. </p>
<p>In an interview with a Colorado radio station, Mr Obama appeared to be engaged already in expectation lowering. Asked about his goals for the first hundred days, he said he would need more time to tackle such big and costly issues as health care reform, global warming and Iraq. &ldquo;The first hundred days is going to be important, but it&rsquo;s probably going to be the first thousand days that makes the difference,&rdquo; he said. He has also been reminding crowds in recent days how &ldquo;hard&rdquo; it will be to achieve his goals, and that it will take time. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand here and pretend that any of this will be easy &mdash; especially now,&rdquo; Mr Obama told a rally in Sarasota, Florida, yesterday, citing &ldquo;the cost of this economic crisis, and the cost of the war in Iraq&rdquo;. Mr Obama&rsquo;s transition team is headed by John Podesta, a Washington veteran and a former chief-of-staff to Bill Clinton. He has spent months overseeing a virtual Democratic government-in-exile to plan a smooth transition should Mr Obama emerge victorious next week. The plans are so far advanced that an Obama Cabinet has been largely decided upon, with the expectation that most of his senior appointments could be announced shortly after election day. </p>
<p>Yet Mr Obama and his aides are under no illusions about the size of the challenges the Democrat will inherit if he enters the Oval Office. Tom Daschle, the party&rsquo;s former leader in the US Senate and a strong contender for the post of White House chief-of-staff in an Obama administration, said last month that the winner next week would have only a 50 per cent chance of winning a second term in 2012. </p>
<p>Not only will the next president take office with the country sliding into a potentially long recession &mdash; and mired in debt &mdash; but the challenges abroad are immense. There is an unfinished war in Iraq, a worsening situation in Afghanistan and an unstable and nuclear-armed Pakistan to contend with. Iran appears intent on acquiring the bomb and there remains the ever-present threat from al-Qaeda and Islamic extremists. </p>
<p>If he wins, Mr Obama will inherit a Democratic-controlled Congress, and might even have the benefit of a 60-seat filibuster-proof &ldquo;supermajority&rdquo; in the Senate. Such a scenario would allow him to push through legislation largely unfettered by Republican opposition. Yet it also means that should the country still be mired in recession in three years&rsquo; time, voters &mdash; who have short memories &mdash; will probably blame him and the Democrats on Capitol Hill. Those stakes have led Mr Obama to conclude that while expectations need to be tempered, big things need to be achieved very early in his first term, when he will still have the political capital to achieve some of his most ambitious legislative goals. </p>
<p>Having promised &ldquo;real&rdquo; change, the pressure will be on him to deliver. In the Colorado interview, Mr Obama added: &ldquo;The next president has got to come quickly out of the box.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The early priorities being lined up if he takes power are a mixture of symbolism and substance. He plans to make a major address in a big Muslim country early in his first term. Having pledged on the campaign trail to close Guantanamo Bay, he is also determined to make early moves to rid America of the controversial prison. Yet what to do with the remaining inmates looms as an intractable problem, as many of their home governments refuse to allow them to return. </p>
<p>Mr Obama&rsquo;s first legislative goals will be to follow through on his pledge to cut taxes for the middle class and raise them for the wealthiest Americans, and to push through a hugely expensive Bill to provide near-universal health insurance. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Having pledged on the campaign trail to close Guantanamo Bay, he is also determined to make early moves to rid America of the controversial prison. Yet what to do with the remaining inmates looms as an intractable problem, as many of their home governments refuse to allow them to return. &#8220;</p>
<p>The way the law is now, if their home governments don&rsquo;t agree to take them back, we are stuck with them forever.  There is also the problem of the deportation procedure which involvesw mulitple hearings and appeals.  Once an illegal felon is released from prison, ICE has just 6 months to put them on a plane out of the country.</p>
<p>The ACLU etc plus the religious organizations go all out to delay the ICE hearings past the 6 month limit.  Most immigration judges are extremely liberal affirmative action types.</p>
<p>So the Guantanamo terrorists will stay here for the rest of their lives.  And if we touch them the leftists will be there to defend them.</p>

			<p>What?  The Messiah is already backing down from his Marxist promises?  Americans  ignorantly may vote in the most inexperienced, extreme leftist this country has ever known, who promises them the world during the worst financial crisis in the last 70 years.  P.T. Barnum had it almost right  &mdash;  there are tens of millions of suckers born every minute.</p>

			<p> Reminds me of a joke: A senator dies and goes before Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates. St. Peter tells him that Heaven doesn&rsquo;t get too many politicians and so they had devised a plan to help them. He has to spend a day in hell and a day in Heaven and then choose where he wants to be. St. Peter then puts him on an elevator, it goes down, when the door opens the Senator finds himself on a plush golf course with a magnificent club huse in the distence. His friends come out and greet him, they have a party in his honor. He plays the best game of golf he&rsquo;s ever had. Before he knows it, the day is over. Satan then puts him back on the elevator. He then spends a day in Heaven, peaceful,  serene very pleasent. St. Peter then walks up to him and say&rsquo;s; you&rsquo;ve had your day in Heaven and Hell; now choose. The Senator chooses Hell. He gets back on the elevator, when he steps off, fire and brimstone, he sees his friends being tortured by demons and the heat is horrible. Satan walks up to him, he says: Satan, what happened? Yesterday it was so nice and fun!! Satan replys: YESTERDAY we were campaigning, TODAY you VOTED!!!</p>

			<p>Obama has done his best to sell the idea he is some kind of messiah here to save the world and his followers have bought his act completely. But now that he thinks he&rsquo;s going to win he&rsquo;s trying to backtrack and temper expectations and of course blame Bush and Republicans for his own failures. He and his followers are already floating the idea he will need 8 yrs to straighten out the &#8220;mess&#8221; this country is in. The hardcore Obama fanatics (Black people, the news media etc) will overlook any shortcomings though because they have to much invested him now and of course play the race card in an attempt to silence any criticism of him.</p>

			<p>This is ridiculous.  This guy has no right to hold this high office and not because he is black - BUT BECAUSE HE DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE.  </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a junior Senator, whose decisions are made based on which way the wind blows.  </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to close Gitmo Bay and what happens to the thugs whose countries refuse to allow them to return.  You can bet, they&rsquo;ll be allowed entry to the U.S., which will just add to the terror cells already here planning their next attack.  Because if anybody believes that 9/11 ended any planning by these guys - they are living in a dream world. The minute those towers fell, those guys were making plans for their next big attack.  We really don&rsquo;t know how long they had been planning 9/11.  </p>
<p>This country is in big trouble both internally and externally if Obama wins next Tuesday.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s rhetoric has been hot air all along. I never thought he intended to do anything about Iraq, for instance. How could he? Whoever ends that fiasco is going to set off a civil war and they&rsquo;ll take responsibility for the occupation&rsquo;s failure whether they deserve it or not. No first-term President is going to take a risk like that. Whoever gets elected will wait until their second term to make any big changes in Iraq, just as Nixon waited until his second term to pull us out of Viet Nam. They&rsquo;ll drag the thing out for four more years at a trillion dollars a year just to guarantee their re-election. As for the economy, Presidents can&rsquo;t do much of anything about the economy except make it worse, and they always do. Personally, I find it hard to believe that anyone takes politician&rsquo;s promises seriously anymore, but even if Obama&rsquo;s sincere about all his schemes, where&rsquo;s he going to get the money to pay for them? The Feds are broke. They&rsquo;re pumping so much funny money into the system trying to prop it up that we&rsquo;re going to see major inflation in a year or two, maybe even hyper-inflation, and the dollar&rsquo;s going to lose what little value it has left. So in a way I hope Obama wins (which it looks like he will). It would be entertaining to watch all the riots if he lost, but it&rsquo;s going to be even more entertaining to watch the reaction on the Left when he bails on all his promises. Blacks, especially, are going to freak out when they realize that electing a black President hasn&rsquo;t changed a thing in their personal lives. They&rsquo;ll like it, though. It&rsquo;ll give them another excuse to riot.</p>

			<p>Anytime you misrepresent and position yourself as a Christ figure, there will be a big letdown. When they see him as the amateur liar who refuses to take any responsibility that he really is, a man naked without his advisors and teleprompter, the euphoria will end.<br>
   When Black people realize he is not going to cure poverty or cater strictly to the Black population, there will be a big letdown. Obama will try some things for his Black powerbase, but if he gets too ambitious at the expense of catering to white liberals,rich power broker, and converted independents who were really responsible for him getting elected, he will be a one term joke.<br>
   He is at Mt.Everest right now. He has done nothing, the press has totally been in the tank for him,he can use race to parry any attacks, and the people who are on his side are emphatic because of their victory. It is all down hill from here. Sooner or later, especially with the ruthless way he is treating journalists not on his side, there will be payback. The race factor will melt away and he will held to the light like all others. I agree that he will not get the crucifiction of W, but the press gets bored and will want to tear down their creation. </p>
<p>So, enjoy now, Obama. Soon, you will not  be able to get away with your imaginary racial slights. There will be a track record and you will be connected to that. Just think,Obama, you will become a real man that cannot blame others, but will be forced to look into the abyss of his own actions and deeds. Whitey helped get you elected, so do not screw him over. Even liberal whites have their limits. They will always hate working class whites the worst,but,if you ignore them, you will be #2. Remember, you are both Black and White, whether you want to admit that or not. White people raised you, whether you want to admit that or not. <br>
   In the end, I think you will be forced to acknowledge that if you want 2 terms. Because, 4 yrs. from now, you will be the incumbent who will have to defend your record, not the naive idealist who floats obsolete, discredited socialist themes. Wait until you raise taxes and jack up regulation on everyone. The same people who think you are Jesus will consider you Judas. The anger at George W.,subprime mess, and anti-republican mandate are what really catapulted you. You will soon realize that you are not special and being President is alot harder than what you see on TV. <br>
   World leaders do not think you are special because of your race or speaking ability. Yes, the world does want an Obama presidency. They would fear McCain, but they know they can play Obama. Nowhere in his life does he show alpha male tendencies, he is strictly a mediator. Foreign leaders know he wants to be like Europe and be liked by the rest of the world. They are just licking their chops right now. The U.S. is right where the rest of the world wants them. In deep debt and a man who wants to be the United Nation&rsquo;s puppet. </p>

Blacks are expecting a big pay-off but they&rsquo;re going to be disappointed.</p>
<p>Here in Buffalo, we have a black mayor, a black chief of police, black principals, a majority black school board, and NY has a black governor. None of this has had any positive impact on the black community which is mired in their perpetual dysfunction.</p>
<p>In time, blacks are going to turn and be Obamas&rsquo; harshest critics for not doing enough for blacks. That and they&rsquo;re going to blame institutionalized white supremacy for standing in the way of black progress just as they blame white supremacy in Buffalo despite their positions of power.</p>
<p>The election of Obama is only going to make them more angry at whites and black leadership.</p>

			<p> The fool has dug his own grave. Businessman who supported him will realize that they will foot the bill for his socialist agenda. Blacks will demand instant gratification and the white liberal morons who voted for him will come to understand he offers nothing of substance.</p>

			<p>So far, sounds pretty much like the prediction Jared Taylor made:</p>
<p><i>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s first annual address to the NAACP will be a love feast, but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment, poverty, and incarceration rates haven&rsquo;t changed at all. Even Mr. Obama&rsquo;s star-struck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that &ldquo;change&rdquo; he promised. There is not going to be change. The system is far too stuck in its self-serving ways for that. With the help of an enlarged Democratic majority in Congress, Mr. Obama may set up some wheezing, byzantine form of socialized medicine, but no one will be happy with it. If Mr. Obama inherits a sick economy, a weak dollar, expensive oil, and shrinking revenues, Americans will not at all like the change they get.</i></p>
<p>It could be an eye-opening four years.</p>

			<p>I have been posting about this everywhere for ages. The line I would always use is - &#8220;Expectations are Resentments waiting to happen&#8221; - and they are.<br>
Now, of course, not ALL expectations are bad. We have a right to expect our Parents to treat us well and not beat us.  We have a right to expect fidelity from a spouse and we have a right to expect a President to do his job and not blame every policy failure on Racism. See? Even I am talking as if Obama has already won. <br>
All joking aside, I have no doubt that his Domestic Policy will reek of cheap scapegoating whenever it doesn&rsquo;t go his way.  But his Foriegn Policy?  I doubt very much that places like, oh, say, China and Russia, will sit still for that, and this is where all the help in the world will not save him. <br>
People in India would starve to death right in front of a healthy cow, just waiting to be sliced, diced, and sautèed. But just because they would starve themselves didn&rsquo;t mean we had to.<br>
Same thing goes for another superstitious belief system known as Political Correctness.  Just because most Americans won&rsquo;t say &#8220;boo&#8221; to Obama doesn&rsquo;t mean Russia and China will play ball. My guess is they won&rsquo;t. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I have been posting about this everywhere for ages. The line I would always use is - &#8220;Expectations are Resentments waiting to happen&#8221; - and they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>from a previous post of mine.</p>
<p>But the REAL reason that expectations are foolish in the case of Obama or any President today is simply because the Presidency, the Office of the President, simply does not have much power. <br>
The House and Senate are one big talking machine, the President tries to look Presidential, but they are in no way running things and haven&rsquo;t been for some time.</p>
<p>The answer is not in any conspiracy, or anything of the sort.  The answer is in Cultural History.  Institutions, and their Offices, like Civilizations and people, die.  But, unlike bodies, whose decomposition is so conspicuous they have to be burned or buried, Institutions can linger, for ages, before most people actually notice.<br>
I believe that such is the case today with practically EVERY Institution, without exception.<br>
So, in this context, yes, to have ANY expectation is foolish, and dangerous.  But, to have the kind of expectations we have seen coming from Obama supporters (fanatics is probably more accurate) is calamitous.  And we will get our calamity. <br>
That&rsquo;s something you can believe in. But if any change follows from this it will be in response to Obama, and what he represents, not because of him.  And exactly what DOES he represent?  Obama represents the culmination of what Nietzsche refered to as &ldquo;the Slave Revolt in Morality&rdquo; and Ortega, taking Nietzsche&rsquo;s lead, called &ldquo;The Revolt of the Masses.&rdquo;<br>

Here&rsquo;s a phrase you are going to start to hear pretty often: mid-term elections.  That&rsquo;s when the House runs again in 2010. </p>
<p>It will probably be a repeat of 1994, when strong disappointment with Clinton led to a Republican takeover.<br>

			<p>McCain just delivered a spirited and inspiring speech in Columbus, Ohio.  Race was not an issue.  Maybe an administration that ignores petty racialism is exactly what the country needs for a few years.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this apparent truce in black/white American race relations is only a temporary reprieve while blax hold their breath awaiting the official outcome of the election.</p>
<p>Once it has been decided, and the smoke has cleared, we can expect a bombardment of demands from the NAACP, Urban League, and countless lesser Black Power agents in response to an Obama win, or we can likely take an extended vacation from such annoyances in the event of another Republican victory.</p>
<p>The choice is clear enough to me.  Let&rsquo;s take the occasion to fix the immigration crisis.  Let&rsquo;s vote Republican and insist that we stop importing more Democrats.      </p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to reality here.  Not many people have high expectations of him to begin with even the people planning on voting for him. Your being manipulated by the media and the polls into believing this guy&rsquo;s base of support is larger than it really is. Obama was campaigning in Iowa yesterday even though the polls said he was 11 points ahead of McCain.  There is one negative news story after another bubbling to the surface.  He has ties to the PLO and has a relative living illegally in the US in a Boston housing project!  This guy is political poison but because he is black people don&rsquo;t expect much from him and excuse him.  Wake up out of your hypnotic trance before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

			<p>I heard an interview on the radio (I think it was on Rush) with a black woman who had just left an Obama rally.  She said she was more excited than she had ever been in her life because if Obama was elected she wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about putting gas in her car, getting a job, or putting food on the table.  I almost feel sad for these people whose lives are so pathetic that they are sitting around waiting for a politician to come save them.  How can you not be disappointed with expectations so high?</p>

			<p>I am reminded of stories of freed slaves following the Union Army shouting Jubilee and expecting the Union Army to take care of them the way their White masters had. They were disappointed then and they will be disappointed now.  They&rsquo;ll soon learn that their new liberator, Obama, is not going to take care of them the way they have been led to believe.</p>
<p>It will be just a matter of time before the scalawag and carpet baggers, both Black and White, come out of the woodwork to take advantage of these newly liberated Blacks. Remember the old scam of &ldquo;Forty acres and a Mule?&rdquo; All a freed slave had to do was to buy the so-called government stakes and use them to mark their 40 acres.</p>
<p>Even today people like Al Sharpton continue to keep the con alive. &ldquo;Sharpton touted how Black folks were still waiting on not only their forty acres, but had to be content on riding a donkey this far in their lives.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, no one is perfect, and this is what we all have in common with Criminals. Imperfection.<br>
The difference, of course, is one of degree.  We all have done things we shouldn&rsquo;t have, but Criminals can&rsquo;t stop doing it and this leads to a progression that is internalized and passed on, in as much as like holds to like.  Talk about Inheritance.<br>
The other thing is since their mechanism for honesty is on permanent mal-function Criminals have to be good Con Artists.  But, when they have been found out, they let it hang out.  They don&rsquo;t even try to hide.  This has been happening slowly but surely during the entire course of the past Century - of that I no longer have any doubts at all. And I say this as a person who is an anti-ideological Independent with lots of personal experience and who has done his homework, particularly as it relates to behavior and cultural history. Both are the source of Reality, of which all Ideologies and Theologies are merely subsidiaries.  And this explains my interest in the Realism movements that are popping up in different ways here and there throughout the Internet.  It&rsquo;s why I am a regular reader of VDARE and AR, and other sites commited to living in Reality.<br>
Anyway, what has all of this shown me?  That we are not just deep inside an Inverted World, we are deep inside an intensified version of the kind of world Dante wrote so well about hundreds of years ago in his Divine Comedy.  <br>
The number one difference between Dante&rsquo;s time and ours is the overwhelming amount of precise information we have about ourselves coming from so many different directions.<br>
And this was before the Internet. But now that it is here it is making it virtually impossible for the Criminals to hide - so, they&rsquo;re not. Though, that&rsquo;s not entirely true. They are still pretending.<br>
I&rsquo;ll be honest, this election to me is like a really bad Monty Python skit, or something from Saturday Night Live, gone horribly wrong. That&rsquo;s why I refer to it as The &ldquo;Election&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s truly bizarre. They are half pretending and half in your face.<br>
To cut to the chase I&rsquo;ll end with this - if you look past the ideological and theological explanations of many out there today and look straight at their behavior and the explanations they offer the confusion clears up immediately and what you are left with is a perfect blueprint for what really accounts for what they are up to, and all about - Pscyho and Socio Pathology.  <br>

<p>She&rsquo;s actually been outdone by Omaba&rsquo;s contradictory &#8220;audacity of hope.&#8221; Hope is in fact the diametric opposite of audacity, which implies daring action.  Hope is nothing more than wishful thinking.  Of course, this allows his supporters to fill in the blanks themselves with their own wishful &#8220;thoughts.&#8221;</p>

Ha! Sen. Hussein backing down from his messianic promises before he&rsquo;s even got the job is pretty funny   &mdash;   esp. as he has nobody but himself to blame for having raised expectations so absurdly high to begin with. </p>
<p>If all this &#8220;hopeful change&#8221; he&rsquo;s been spouting off about were actually viable, how come his boyee Bill Clinton never attempted any of it? Bubba had EIGHT YEARS in which to implement such &#8220;transformative&#8221; &#8220;improvements&#8221; to Big Bad America, but didn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Why not? <br>
 <br>
Answer: Because such vast, sweeping, structural changes to the way things have traditionally been done in this country are either undesirable or impossible or both. </p>
<p>And also because Bill Clinton, as foolish and dangerous as he was, wasn&rsquo;t anywhere near as foolish and dangerous as BHO. At least Big Bill has never tried to present himself as some sort of supernatural Christ figure; and neither has his wife.  </p>

			<p>Firstly, this is merely wishful thinking on the part of the Democrats.  With a victory margin in the last week of the race of between 4 and 8 percentage points, it is nearly certain that Obama will lose this election.  Yes, there are millions of devoted supporters, but a coalition of drop out, drug dealers, homosexuals, even with its hollywood multimillionare celebs and George Soros&rsquo;s and the dedicated white left, which I was by chance exposed to last night, does not a majority make, at least not yet in this country.  Obama would need at least a 10% or greater led in the polls in order to be confident of victory for a variety of reasons which I will not go into here.</p>
<p>Even the MSM, which is just another branch of his campaign team, does not give him a 10% led currently.  My daughter was in a play last night at her school, a quasi Quaker one which has very good academic standards, etc, but is a bastion of leftist delusions.  I knew that I was in distinctly unfriendly territory within a few minutes of entering the line to pay for the tickets when the obese white woman directly in front of me smiled to her friend in line ahead of her and loudly said that she couldn&rsquo;t imagine Obama not winning easily (presumably because everyone that she know is a leftist who supports the new messiah).  Naturally the play was essentially an in-your=face bit of homosexual propaganda promoting sympathy for AIDS victims and the underclass and portraying the one businessman and the one police officer are brutes.  It was quite an experience sitting through a three hour performance of such absolute trash surrounded by a group of affluent whites who collectively thought it the most normal thing in the world for their sons and daughters to be playing the roles of homosexual and lesbian couples and transvestites.  I caught a rather extended glimpse of whites whom I consider to be the enemy of everything which I believe in and respect and who proudly support everything which I detest.  Had it not been at a school, I would have been carrying a 40SW glock concealed while watching the performance and would certainly have been the only person in the room who knew the difference between an AR15 and an AM radio station.  I found the entire experience profoundly unsettling but such groups, while quite real, do not represent the majority of American citizens.<br>
Should I be wrong and Obama wins, there will of course be riots of celebration across most of our large cities by his black supporters which will be reported by the MSM, if at all, as minor disturbances.  His administration will be the greatest disaster for the country in living memory and he will not be reelected.  The only real question is just how much serious harm he will be able to do in four years.  I expect that he will be able to do a significant amount, especially given the fundamental instability of the US economy due in large part to his Democratic predecessors.</p>

Blacks have no grasp of what a &#8220;fact&#8221; is. There isnt even such a thing as &#8220;reality&#8221;. If you just keep running your mouth, jive talking, hustling, rapping you can believe anything, and if you<br>
do it long enough with enough showmanship you can get a group of people to follow along for the entertainment value if nothing else. This is all Obama is:  a high class ghetto street corner<br>
hustler carrying out his scams on a spectacular level. Instead of selling stolen goods, or drugs, Obama is hustling his suckers with &#8220;A VISION OF AMERICA&#8221;. His dupes are the media, the leftists of the United States and Europe.<br>
But like all such scam artists..when it comes time to deliver they begin hemming and hawing, procrastinating, shuffling, and looking for the next group of suckers.</p>

			<p>Friends and Fellows&hellip;even if God&rsquo;s law is forgotten and Man&rsquo;s law fails by confusion and irrational hope there exists a body of law that cannot be refused or ignored, which applies in all cases and times with deliberate calm, indifferent to all other considerations.

<p><i>It will probably be a repeat of 1994, when strong disappointment with Clinton led to a Republican takeover.</i> I agree that Republicans will pick up seats in Congress in the midterm elections, but it would be mathematically impossible for them to become a majority in either house because there won&rsquo;t be enough Democrats whose seats are up for election (and that&rsquo;s assuming no gains for the Democrats in 2008, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s likely they will gain some).  In other words, it takes more than one election to demolish a Congressional majority.</p>

			<p>Friends, </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s enjoy today, because tomorrow may well mark the beginning of the end.</p>
<p>If that creature is elected, there will be a spontaneous shift in mass consensus, worldwide, in regard to America.  Outside the Western nations currently committing racial suicide, few non-African people have positive thoughts about blacks.  Russians, as only one example, absolutely despise them. The Chinese see them in an opportunistic way&hellip;.as pawns/cattle/expendable biomass.</p>
<p>The Chinese already view Africa as vacant territory ripe for exploitation.  Heaven help us if they now come to see America in the same light: READY FOR TAKEOVER.</p>
<p>But the greatest threat, as I&rsquo;ve hinted, lies not in specific individuals or entities, but in the subtle aggregate effect of our being seen by the world (and ourselves) as suddenly ineffectual/impotent/incompetent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see much difference between the candidates or their parties.  Neither has any interest in protecting America or Americans.  The real danger is how the world will view a nation foolish enough to elect a cigarette-smoking former drug &#8216;experimenter&rsquo;, whose only qualification for anything is the fact that he is (almost) black.</p>

			<p>All those promises Obama has made will mean nothing to blacks, even if he can&rsquo;t follow throught.  Blacks don&rsquo;t care if he reneges on his campaign promises.  All they care about is that one of their own is sitting in the White House.  He won&rsquo;t have to follow through with even one promise and they&rsquo;ll still vote for him again in 2012.  </p>
<p>Even after Marion Berry was thrown out of office in Washington DC when they had him dead to rights on video snorting cocaine in a hotel room, the blacks claimed it was a setup by the corrupt police.  Years later, after rehab, Berry came back and they re-elected him. They didn&rsquo;t care what he did or didn&rsquo;t do, they just wanted one of their own in office.</p>
<p>Which brings up the ugliest of thoughts from people like me.  This is why they should not have any power.  When they get it, they don&rsquo;t know how to use it and when they misuse their power, they use it as a club to bang whitey over the head with.  </p>
<p>If the United States hasn&rsquo;t taken into account, the shape of ever African country that has been ruled by blacks, we are doomed.  And it won&rsquo;t be the blacks that put Obama in office.  It&rsquo;s all the sniveling, cowardly whites who want to be trendy or who believe that drivel that if they don&rsquo;t vote for him, then they are racist.  It&rsquo;s the whites who will put him over the top in electoral votes, not blacks.  Right now there aren&rsquo;t enough of them to do that.  </p>

<p>True, to some point Dedalus.  But as President Obama for 4 years, he can do a lot of damage to the Federal Court System and Supreme Court.  Within the next 4 years, he will most certainly appoint 2 new Supremes and many, many federal judges, who will have lifetime jobs.  He has already said he will appoint judges that look at the person and their situation in life.  Well, what does that mean?  It means that if he appoints judges that ignore the Constitution and our laws and base each case on the individual (definition - if you are black, brown or dark skinned), you will be assured of a positive outcome.  If you&rsquo;re white, you might as well forget it.</p>
<p>The other stuff the president does or doesn&rsquo;t do - you are correct, is based on what Congress does or doesn&rsquo;t do.  Look, I waited for 8 years for Bush to use his veto pen and he never did, except for once I think.  What do you think an Obama president is going to do?</p>
<p>But the judge appointments have the potential of really destroying anything that&rsquo;s left of our Constitution or our laws and our laws are already screwed up.  Take the hate laws.  They weren&rsquo;t written for everybody, just minorities.  </p>
<p>This is the part of an Obama presidency that truly scares me.  If he wins tomorrow, I wager that when my grandchildren are my age, they won&rsquo;t even know about our Constitution or the freedoms that were granted to us.  <br>

			<p>&#8220;The Chinese already view Africa as vacant territory ripe for exploitation. Heaven help us if they now come to see America in the same light: READY FOR TAKEOVER.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chinese will treat the average white a lot better than the american white liberals, blacks and hispanics do.</p>
<p>Most Chinese doctors will work only with white, asian or filipino nurses and med techs.  They don&rsquo;t allow any disfunctional obnoxious affirmative action blacks anywhere near their patients.</p>

			<p>&#8220;True, to some point Dedalus. But as President Obama for 4 years, he can do a lot of damage to the Federal Court System and Supreme Court.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely true.  This country is ruled by unelected, life long tenured federal judges who tend to be extremely liberal.  After all, they went to high school, college and law school and were brainwashed with anti american anti white propaganda for years.</p>
<p>How do you think affirmative action went from a 12 percent quota for american blacks to the present no whites need apply?  </p>
<p>Federal judges and the ACLU, NAACP, communist front National Lawyers League, ADL, AJC, all the white hating leftists and their hand picked judges turned affirmative action from a 12 percent quota for blacks to no jobs left for whites.</p>
<p>It was the judges, not congress that created the &#8220;hispanic&#8221; race and mandated affirmative action for hispanics.</p>
<p>Judges are now and have been the main enemy of american whites since hard leftists Brandeis and Frankfurt got on the supreme court 80 years ago.</p>
<p>Of course republican presidents appoint anti white judges too.  Earl Warren groveled to the NAACP and ended school segregation thus subjecting hundred of thousands of white students and teachers to the Lord of the Flies nightmare that blacks always, always establish in schools.  </p>
<p>Breyer and Souter are solidly anti white racist liberals and they were appointed by Bush Sr.</p>
<p>We no longer have separation of equal powers.  The legislative power is completely under control of the judiciary and NAACP, ACLU, ADL, NOW anti white racist lawyers who are funded by the white taxpayer.  </p>
<p>Judges can create any law they want.  Judges can overturn any law passed by the legislative power.</p>
<p>They are absolute dictators.  Look at the record of the judges over the last 60 years.  It is a bit more civilized, but they are doing to us what Lenin did to the kulaks.</p>
<p>Judges deny us employment in any field from dishwashing to physician and scientist.  Judges deny our brightest young people college admission.  Judges encourage and enable out of control black on white crime.  Judges have happily given blacks permission to do anything they want with us.  Judges have stood by as blacks drove whites out of the cities by force and violence.</p>
<p>And the republicans have done nothing to resist the dictatorship of the Judges.</p>
