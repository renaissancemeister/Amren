				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristin Davis, Virginian-Pilot (Hampton Roads, Virginia), October 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Chesapeake police organizations on Wednesday threatened to sue the city if it voids recent test results that would propel 30 men &mdash; none of them black &mdash; toward the ranks of sergeant and lieutenant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Michael Imprevento, an attorney for Chesapeake&rsquo;s Fraternal Order of Police and the Coalition of Police, called any interruption in the process unlawful.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the initial test was fair and created a level playing field for all participants,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If the city delays action or invalidates the procedures, we will seek legal relief. Too much is at stake for too many good people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thirty-six police officers took the exam for lieutenant earlier this month; none of the nine women and blacks who tested was among the top tier.</p>
<p>Of the 108 who took the test for sergeant, none of the 23 blacks and women scored high enough to move forward.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city initially voided the test results. City Manager William Harrell said the decision was made to hire a consultant after it was determined that no incorrect materials were handed out after the official resource lists were published July 1.</p>
<p>It is unclear how much the review will cost, but Harrell said he hopes it is far less than the $50,000 the city pays a consultant annually to administer tests and conduct job interviews, among other duties.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that compromise is one that protects the city and those that are part of the process,&#8221; Harrell said.</p>
<p>Imprevento disagreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s scant comfort to scores of qualified, hardworking people who are now in limbo,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It further compounds the negative impact on morale that this whole issue has created. All of these officers stand together, and they all consider themselves blue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imprevento said of the promotion exams. &#8220;The same policies and procedures are available for all to review as police officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my belief that any invalidation of these results would be based strictly on race.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The test was race-neutral.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Once again they tie women in with blacks to manipulate public opinion. It&rsquo;s a test. You either pass or fail. If you fail study harder next time. </p>

			<p>This entire society from coast to coast just keeps getting worse and worse, denying equality to whites at every turn, determined to place dangerously unqualified people in positions they can&rsquo;t competently perform.</p>
<p>Just recently I&rsquo;ve made a determination to back out of this disgusting multicult society and actively support those things that will weaken it so the multicults will see first hand the results of their handiwork, but more so because it will mean an implosion sooner, so we can get rid of this horror and the white fools who support it all.</p>
<p>The closer we get to disintegration the louder I intend to cheer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse is better&#8221; is the only real motto to live by.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m supporting lowering the score on ALL civil service exams to whatever the applicant feels is passing, and who we install in various positions should be determined by Hollywood and the media.</p>
<p>And, by all means let&rsquo;s invoke more wealth distribution, quadruple the welfare roles (I intend to get my share) and encourage all WN&rsquo;s to sign up for every benefit they can possibly get by whatever means necessary.</p>
<p>Having an all black cabinet is a good idea also.  And let&rsquo;s push to get Michelle Obama appointed as Secretary of Defense in order to utilize her brilliant mind to the utmost.  I won&rsquo;t mind her mandating that all Generals must be transvestites and doing away with security clearances because they&rsquo;re racist holdovers from wicked honky policies.  </p>
<p>I mean we do want her to &#8220;finally&#8221; be pround of her country, dont we?</p>

			<p>Sorry if this may be a bit off point, but it may be of interest to some.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m white. A few years ago I was having a problem with passing the BAR exam in a very difficult jurisdiction. My law degree was from a Cousin Vinny Law School and my life experience was blue collar.</p>
<p>So,I figured my social background was pretty much the same as blacks who also weren&rsquo;t passing this particular BAR exam.</p>
<p>I then contacted a black professor who had been praised in a column by a well known national black columnist for his BAR review work in helping blacks pass the BAR exam in this jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The black professor quickly told me he wouldn&rsquo;t help whites pass the BAR exam.</p>
<p>This made me wonder whether this guy was anti-white or whether he was somehow teaching his black students how to cheat on the BAR exam in some way.  My guess is that it was the latter.<br>

They will have a very hard time finding bias in a test that is based on existing policies and procedures. If they did, it would be like saying &#8220;the concepts of police work are biased against blacks.&#8221; </p>
<p>No &#8220;consultant&#8221; is going to be able to change that.</p>

			<p>   The American Left will have equal results by race and gender and if that is not possible with the tests the tests will be changed or constant trouble will be caused.<br>
   It is not just in police tests but many industries cannot use IQ tests and other tests to determine who CAN actually do the job but are forced to hire many and pay some who cannot do the job because of racial threats to violence and lawsuits if &#8220;equality is not maintained&#8221;. There are hundreds of references to this in current news.<br>
   I cannot be promoted at a company because I am not of the correct ethnic group and the personnel office will only hire what retired.  I have long been the one called in when an insoluble problem arises, 3 times this week, and all are quickly solved.<br>
   What happens when I finally refuse and quit ? It is coming soon. <br>

			<p>Cheers for this police group fighting such a dangerous PC outrage as lowering police testing standards for promotion. This kind of outrage has been going on too long: for example <br>
 http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/news/local/2008/09/30/ddn093008dojweb.html<br>
  <br>
Blacks might like to claim that testing of literacy and (essentially) cognitive abilities are irrelevant to police work (and many other jobs) but a lot of research has been done on general intelligence and job performance; esp. by Prof. Linda S. Gottfredson who has given a famous Constitutional Subcommittee testimony here </p>

			<p>The courts will shoot down the test.  The courts have shot down every non race/gender based police promotion test since 1965.</p>
<p>When will the government impose the no whites need apply rule on the judiciary?</p>

<p>The controlled media lumps women with &#8220;Blacks&#8221; for the same purpose that they attempt to identify Latinos with &#8220;Blacks&#8221;. To try to create an expanded coalition in order to weaken resistance to &#8220;Black&#8221; incompetence by pretending the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; are just a part of a greater problem.</p>

			<p>And of course, they lump all white women together with the black women to skew the statistics even more.  I&rsquo;m sure the white women outscored both the black men and black women, even if they scored lower than the white men, which would be predictable considering that men, in general, have higher mathematical appitude than women.</p>

<p>Could be true. The Asian language newspapers advertise prep courses that &#8220;guarantee passing.&#8221;</p>
<p>A friend took a course in airplane mechanics years ago.  There were a lot of arabs in the class who had been sent by their government.  They always got 95 on the written tests.</p>
<p>But on the practical tests they failed.  The teacher had a pointer and pointed to different parts of the engine. What&rsquo;s this?  Dunno  What&rsquo;s this? Dunno  What does this do?  Dunno</p>
<p>And when they really got into actual repairs the arabs couldn&rsquo;t do a thing.  But they all went home with their certified aviation mechanics certificates.</p>
