<h1>Boyd Gets Maximum 18 Years; Victim&rsquo;s Father: &lsquo;I Hate You&rsquo;</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Calling him a dangerous criminal, a federal judge today sentenced Eric Dewayne &#8220;E&#8221; Boyd to the maximum 18-year prison term for being an accessory to a fatal carjacking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply put, the defendant shows a lack of regard for the law,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Tom Varlan said late this afternoon. &#8220;It&rsquo;s necessary to separate the defendant from the public to prevent future crimes and to protect the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Varlan&rsquo;s decision is a rare one. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has in the last few years given federal judges wider sentencing latitude, most continue to use a mathematical calculation known as sentencing guidelines.</p>
<p>Varlan deemed Boyd&rsquo;s crime so heinous and his history so violent that he imposed a sentence that technically fell outside Boyd&rsquo;s guideline range. It&rsquo;s a move federal judges employ, particularly in the Eastern District of Tennessee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Defense attorney Phil Lomonaco argued that Boyd had merely harbored slaying suspect Lemaricus Davidson and had not actively aided and abetted him, a key distinction in terms of punishment.</p>
<p>By Lomonaco&rsquo;s account, Boyd should have faced only three to four years in prison.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Jennings, however, argued that Boyd, who committed a series of violent robberies in 1994 and while in prison racked up several criminal offenses behind bars &mdash; including assault and threatening a guard &mdash; rates far more punishment than federal law on the accessory charge allows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve never seen a case which more precisely laid out the need for maximum sentencing,&#8221; Jennings said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s only 18 years. That&rsquo;s all you can do for the citizens of Knox County. That&rsquo;s what you need to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The sentencing hearing got under way this morning with the testimony that Boyd&rsquo;s criminal history was underrated.</p>
<p>U.S. Probation Officer Myra Melton testified before Varlan in support of prosecutors&rsquo; bid to convince Varlan to slap Boyd with the maximum 18 years for his conviction for hiding out Davidson.</p>
<p>Melton said that legal wrangling in state court led to a plea deal for Boyd in an unrelated robbery spree in 1994 that resulted in several robberies, to which Boyd confessed, being dismissed.</p>
<p>She also said a change in federal law benefited Boyd by discounting some of those robbery convictions.</p>
<p>As a result, Melton testified, Boyd earned far fewer criminal history points than she believes he deserves.</p>
<p>His penalty range depends in part on how many criminal history points he has.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boyd admitted in state court nine robberies in 1994 in which he repeatedly brandished and sometimes fired weapons.</p>
<p>In one instance, he opened fire on the vehicle of a witness to a convenience store robbery because he thought the witness was about to alert police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a rare move, federal prosecutors are asking a judge to ignore sentencing guidelines and slap Boyd with the toughest punishment allowed by law.</p>
<p>Stone filed a memorandum Friday putting Boyd on notice that he and Jennings intended to seek an 18-year prison term.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Boyd) demonstrated in 1994 that he had no regard for the value of human life when he endangered the lives of so many people during his violent crime spree,&#8221; Stone wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Boyd) demonstrated this predatory attitude once again in January 2007, when he did his best to accomplish the flight of one of the perpetrators of one of, if not the most, horrendous crimes ever committed in Knoxville.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the protection of citizens who have yet to suffer at his hand or those of his associates, like Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom suffered, the Court must impose the maximum sentence allowable under the law,&#8221; Stone continued.</p>
<p>Boyd was convicted earlier this year of hiding out Lemaricus Davidson after Christian and Newsom were carjacked, kidnapped, beaten, raped and murdered.</p>
<p>Davidson and three others are charged in Knox County Criminal Court with the torture slayings. Stone argued in his sentencing memorandum that Boyd escaped adequate state court justice in the 1994 robbery spree when the terms of his plea deal wound up tied to that of a co-defendant, who won a big break for both himself and Boyd via a successful attack on police tactics.</p>
<p>That means his criminal history is underrated and his penalty range low-balled in a sealed report on what sentencing guidelines Varlan should consider when deciding Boyd&rsquo;s fate at a hearing next week, Stone wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Boyd) has admitted guilt in no fewer than nine armed robberies in Knoxville with approximately 40 total victims (in 1994),&#8221; Stone [prosecutor Tracy Stone] wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Boyd) fired a pistol during the commission of three of the robberies &mdash; on one occasion into the ceiling, on a second occasion in the direction of a store clerk to keep the clerk from reaching for the telephone, and on a third occasion directly into the automobile of an eyewitness presumably to kill the witness and avoid being identified.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This black thug should have been taken off the streets with a heavy sentence in any one of his 9 priors where he shot at someone during a robbery.  How anyone could have such a bad rap sheet and not spend at least a quarter century behind bars is a failure of the judicial system in this country.  If he were white, he would have been in prison when the crime occurred.  Too much leniency is shown to perps because they&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excellent example of someone Jesse, Al, and Spike Lee, thinks is treated too harshly by the system.  They want more black criminals like him on the street so they can vote.</p>

<p>This will be a rather brief  set of comments from me.</p>
<p>This animal and his &#8220;associates&#8221; are involved in a crime of violence against whites, that is all that needs to be known in order to put them down! This sentence is far too kind, far too soft; it should be a punishment so horrible and public, that blacks understand one and only one thing when they see it. This being, that whatever you do to whites in your petty hatreds against us for your fantasized injustices of the past, we will pay you back a million times more, or better.</p>
<p>Enough said!</p>

			<p>Why no indictment? This is the most disturbing part of this article. Thank you Jamie for letting your readers know that even though testimony put him behind the wheel of the car that took these people to the apartments on Washington Ave., eye witness testimony puts him at the Chipman street house that same night, WHY has Nichols not sought to indict Boyd?</p>

			<p>If Hollywood had this rare talent, they would have him starring in a movie as a rocket scientist, opposite a white woman who loved him for his mind and his kindness, while he was always fighting off stupid, criminal white males who hated him for no reason at all.</p>

			<p>He was judged and found guilty. The penalty is not adequate. Don&rsquo;t waste any more time and money on appeals. Don&rsquo;t waste any more food, water and housing on him. Don&rsquo;t waste any more of Earth&rsquo;s oxygen on him. Strap him to a gurney and stick a needle in his arm. Cremate his stinking remains so they don&rsquo;t take up any of this Earth&rsquo;s real estate for burial. Do this within 30 days of conviction and send the message loud and clear that this is what the uncivilized among us can expect from now on. Swift and utter annialhation.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;I hate you,&#8221; Gary Christian said. &#8220;My son hates you. My wife hates you. I&rsquo;ve not prayed since the day you were arrested. Today, I&rsquo;m going to pray but don&rsquo;t you think for a second I&rsquo;m praying for you.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Mr. Christian is to be commended. Rather than forgiving and hugging the murderer as too many brainwashed victims do, he told this sadistic killer what he thought. The only other one I can recall is the father of Ron Goldman. Most others are caught up in the &#8220;Dead Man Walking&#8221; Syndrome.</p>
<p>I hope Mr. Christian finds peace but let it be with the help of the people he loves.</p>

			<p>Sad how rightful justice for this criminal in our modern society has been transformed merely into the time span for the waiting period for this dirtbag&rsquo;s illegitimate offspring to be treated as an adult for a similar offense. The mention of the victim&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s strong yet ultimately meaningless (in the eyes of the &#8216;justice&rsquo; system) oaths is supposed to represent (and quell) the unspoken and unrepresented rage of the law-abiding public. The public who have their own daughters and sons unknowingly being targeted in the public commons for unspeakable horrors based solely upon their race. </p>
<p>The case has been closed for this particular participant. The rights of the victims and the rights of their families were silenced long before. Expect more of the same as this country transforms against the will of the majority. </p>

			<p>Nobody should get to excited about this sentence. He&rsquo;ll be out on parole in half that time, assuming the sentence isn&rsquo;t further reduced in an appeals court. Our criminal justice system is a joke. Horrible crimes like this happen all the time, many of which never even see a court room. The prosecutors do there best, judges put on the usual dog and pony show, and then we all go back to sleep, safe because the government has put the boogeyman away. We never even realize that the government then quietly puts these criminals back on our streets. The blame lies squarely on us. The American Public with it&rsquo;s terminal case of A.D.D. gets all up in arms when these cases first come to light, but then quickly move on to something else forgetting to make sure justice is served. Wait, strike that. Most of the time the public gets up in arms. There was almost no national coverage of this crime. That tends to be the case when blacks attack whites. Here&rsquo;s an interesting little thing to keep in mind. I&rsquo;m not sure how many of you watch &#8220;Law &amp; Order&#8221;, but I&rsquo;ve seen almost every episode. Every time the show begins, and they show the victim of whatever that episodes crime is, I can almost always tell what race the perpetrator is. If the victim is white, the criminal will be white. If the victim is black, well the criminal can be any race. I&rsquo;ve seen almost every episode of &#8220;Law &amp; Order S.V.U.&#8221; and only one episode comes to mind where a black person was attacking whites. It&rsquo;s the same with every other show on television. I&rsquo;m pretty sure A.R. has an article about this same phenomenon. The national media doesn&rsquo;t show whites being victims of blacks. It&rsquo;s a shame that this is one of the only places where I can hear about cases like this, (no offense to A.R. I love this site). I know I&rsquo;ve gone off on a tangent, but it&rsquo;s cases like this one that make me hate the state of this country so bad. I PRAY EVERYDAY FOR AN ECONOMIC COLLAPSE!!!</p>

			<p>My God!  He is an African American!  Who would have guessed?  Perhaps deportation to Africa where his talents are more acceptable would be in order after the 18 years are served.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that I would never have written that 15 years ago, but after fleeing an increasingly violent (and inept) South Africa 10 years ago, my whole attitude has changed and is it any wonder?</p>

			<p>Even if he didn&rsquo;t pull the trigger himself, he was still an accessory.  The victims were raped, mutilated and tortured for several hours (or in Ms. Christian&rsquo;s case - for a couple of days) before they were finally killed.  Eighteen years seems like a light sentence given how gruesome and sadistic these crimes were.</p>

			<p>Reading Winston Smith&rsquo;s post reminds me: I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s been covered here, but has anyone heard of Heather Brammer, the dry cleaner clerk who was shot execution style and survived? To tell her story she was on the Ellen show, which my Mom was watching and I happened to see, and I, being aware of which race greatly disproportionately commits crimes, was interested to know the race of the perpetrator, which, I gathered, could be determined by the willingness to identify it. It was stringently avoided; &#8220;a man&#8221;, &#8220;he&#8221;, blah blah blah, but, really, it was a possibility that the race of the criminal may not have been very pertainent to the telling, and thus I drew no conclusion from it   &mdash;   for that reason, and additionally, because in the course of the segment it was revealed that she, Brammer, was not only able to obviously survive, but was able to provide description, and I assumed that, wanting to catch the perpetrator, they would give it, presumably at the end, because they had not yet. </p>
<p>So it was moving closer to conclusion, without description, and with rising suscpicion: &#8220;Where&rsquo;s that description? If you want to catch the guy, give the description on national TV!&#8221; &#8220;This is ridiculous, what are they going to do, not give it?&#8221; &#8220;You know, Mom, I bet you a thousand dollars he&rsquo;s black; they do this all the time   &mdash;   where they dance around the race of the perpetrator the perpetrator is black or whatnot; not white!&#8221; She said I couldn&rsquo;t know that, and then the segment was ending; Ellen gave Brammer a vacation, and said something to the effect of: &#8220;If you want to see the police sketch of the perpetrator, we have it at our website, www.ellen.com.&#8221; Which was ridiculous, as it is standard behavior for her to display images on her little screen and your television. How long would it have taken to display the d*mned sketch, for of all things not some frivilous cutesy stuff but to increase the odds of <i>catching a murderous criminal?</i> The obvious conclusion: totally black. And, indeed, doing an internet search revealed: totally black. Though even when searching on the internet, there seemed a reluctance to admit the race of the perpetrator; on those sites with the sketch, the race could not be avoided, but where there was only text, some did not say the race at all, and those that did say it did so without according appropriate importance to the fact: instead of &#8220;A black man walked in on yadda yadda yadda&#8221;, it was &#8220;A man walked in on&hellip;yadda yadda yadda, and oh, he was black, g&rsquo;bye.&#8221; But this last bit may just be me, because doing a search now seems to finds more sites where the race is apparent than I found initially.</p>

			<p>Average time served in the federal prison system is NOT 1/3 of one&rsquo;s sentence, ABC.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.  Eighteen years times 12 months per year is 216 months.  If Boyd receives the maximum time off for good behavior the federal prison system allows (one day in eight), he will have to serve a minimum at least 189 months, or just shy of 16 years.  Parole was eliminated in the feds back in about 1986, so Boyd will never be paroled.</p>
<p>That bears repeating: Boyd can not legally be paroled.</p>
<p>He should just be happy he isn&rsquo;t going to be receiving an injection of the Goodbye Juice, the way his accomplices probably are.</p>

			<p>There are times when words are unable to describe the sense of outrage one feels, and this is one of them. Unfortunately, due to lack of media coverage of this and many other such cases of black on white crime, the kind of healthy emotional reaction I and most others on this web site must experience will not be shared by most other whites in this society - and that is how those who control United States society want matters to remain.</p>

			<p>And nowhere, save the title quote by the victim&rsquo;s father, does the word &#8220;hate&#8221; appear.  The horrific hate behind this racially motivated crime does not qualify as a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, which I can only presume would add to the maximum sentence.</p>

			<p>From the article I see that this is a Federal case. There is no parole in the Federal system, he will have to serve every day he was sentanced to with a credit given for time already spent in the county or city jail. But 18 years still isn&rsquo;t nearly enough for him. Yet another career criminal with a chance to get out and perpetrate violence on innocent (white) people before he dies. </p>

			<p>I live about 2 hours from Knoxville and this horrific crime received NO attention except for a 2 paragraph story on page 7 of the Johnson City Press just after it happened.</p>
<p>This is our country.  A media controlled by politically correct liberal, bleeding heart elitists.  Every rationally sane person, who knows about this story, knows damn well that if the race of the victims and the criminals had been reversed, this would still be national news.  A sentence of 18 years for a white guy accused of the same crime would be met with outrage and possible violence by race hustlers like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.  Every politician in Tennessee would be clamoring for TV time to tell everybody how irresponsible the judge was and how he should be removed from the bench.  It would be neverending until the white guy was taken out and strung up at the nearest tree and the victims families were paid millions of dollars by the taxpayers for their grief and loss.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t that way and this is what we can expect.  Total silence from the media and no outrage from a single politician, white or black, about this lousy sentence.  There won&rsquo;t be any boycotts or threats of violence.  No blaring TV reports and no Jesse Jackson and/or Al Sharpton declaring once again how unfair and racist the justice system is to black men.</p>
<p>I do, however, hope that Mr. Christian finds peace.  Losing a loved one in such a horrific way can last a lifetime.  I know, I lost a sister and 4 nieces to a drunk driver last year and I and my whole family are still feeling the affects.  I don&rsquo;t know that I will ever get over the loss but I was able to forgive the driver.  I hope Mr. Christian, for his own sake and his family, can find it in himself to at least throw off the hate.  It&rsquo;s horrible heavy baggage and Mr. Christian shouldn&rsquo;t waste one more minute of his time or thoughts on the evil thugs that killed those 2 young people.</p>

			<p>Boyde and his accomplishes should have been put away far before this crime.  With his criminal history and considering the nature of the crime he has been found guilty of, he should receive a swift death sentence, one which will not cost the taxpayers of the country in excess of $50,000/year to maintain him in a federal prison with its gym, TV&rsquo;s and libraries(not that he could be expected to read).  Multiply a conservative $50k X 18 years and you have the additional cost to society of this individual&rsquo;s crimes.  His provision of a jail cell for 18 years will cost a minimum of $900, 000.  How is this &#8220;justice&#8221;?<br>
As our society becomes increasingly more violent in the coming years of economic depression, there will be many, many more such individuals.  How will a society which is growing increasingly less affluent afford the cost of catching, prosecuting and imprisoning this coming wave of violent criminals?  There is only one way and that is to impose a swift system of capitol punishment on anyone who commits ffirst degree murder as well as a host of other violent crimes of similar magnitude.<br>
The liberal justice system of the days of American affluence are drawing to a close, one way or the other.  It is time for the judiciary to open its eyes to reality.</p>

			<p>The worst part of the Knoxville Murders is the failure of the Mainstream News Media to even report it.  This story is so horrendous that it should have been top news on every TV and radio station world wide and should have had full front page billing on every newspaper. Instead it was hidden and all those responsible for purposely hiding this story need to hang their heads in total shame for you all are not journalists or reporters or radio and TV people, you are nothing but spineless gutless cowards and perhaps someday this type of crime will happen to you or somebody in your family and justifiably nobody says a dam word about it. Nobody even reported that Hal Turner held a rally last year in Knoxville Tenn. to protest &#8220;black crime&#8221; in that city. Thank God we have AMREN and other sites on the internet that are not afraid to tell the truth. However I do remember one little foxy lady that had the balls to actually tell the stories of the Knoxville Murders and also the Wichita Massacre one night filling in for Bill O&rsquo;Reilly on the Factor. It was sometime last year and her name is Michelle Malkin and I haven&rsquo;t seen her on Fox News since, especially when she was on all the time. I guess that tells us something?        </p>

			<p>White lawyers and white judges let Boyd off for 9 armed robberies in 1994.  A conviction for any one of the crimes should have been enough to hang him.  But no.  We are being destroyed from within.</p>

			<p>Generally speaking I wonder if these idiots (black leadership) who promote hate whitey zeitgeist in their community that leads to this evil behavior ever consider the fact that all the violence and grizzly abuses against non-blacks (recall also the bloody murder of a Chinese delivery man in NY by blacks) that they are inciting in their people might come back to haunt them.. They are heaping condemnation on their community&hellip;i.e. if the economy completely collapses and their is chaos&hellip;to be sure the blacks will riot and cause problems but there may be a big backlash against all blacks in general.  They are still a minority and Hispanics and Asians are more &#8220;racist&#8221; than Whites when it comes to blacks&hellip; I am not advocating it but it seems that unless they clean up there act there will be a backlash.</p>

			<p>Voting for liberals (Democrats) means you are voting for liberal judges.  Be careful who you vote for.  The Democrats can talk the talk about the economy, &#8220;I feel your pain.&#8221; etc. But when it comes to crime they will appoint their liberal friend judges who will always put criminals before victims.</p>

			<p>Gayle, accept my condolences. I had no idea you had suffered such a tragedy. I am relieved you are forgiving. I would not be.</p>
<p>Forgiving is all very well, but these thugs show no remorse. </p>

			<p><i>[This story]  &#8220;was hidden and all those responsible for hiding it need to hang their heads in shame for you all are not journalists or reporters or radio and TV people,  you are nothing but spineless, gutless cowards &hellip;.  perhaps someday this type of crime will happen to you or somebody in your family and justifiably nobody says a dam word about it.&#8221;    &mdash;    GERRY   </i><br>

Well, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what goes on behind the scenes in a newspaper office or TV studio.  You&rsquo;re certainly right that it was a disgrace.  Absolutely! But I&rsquo;m pretty sure that those reporters&rsquo; stories  are subject to revision and censorship from those above.  (And certainly their salaries and their careers are!) They can&rsquo;t just write or say whatever they want.  They have to answer to their bosses (who remain unseen to the public).  So the real blame should go to those who own and run the newspapers, not to the employees who merely work for them.  Let&rsquo;s be fair and place the blame where it belongs.  Reporters (however well paid)  are just employees.</p>

			<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, the sentence the judge gave Boyd was the highest he could give under the law. One reason crimes like this should be heavily reported is to show people the threat that black criminals are, but also that it is dangerous to be out late at night. A whole different class of people are out and about around midnight. During the day, they are in their holes, but come out at night.</p>
