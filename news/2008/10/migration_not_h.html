<h1>Migration Not Helping Skills Shortage</h1>
									<div align="left">
						<i>Guy Healy, Australian (Sydney), Oct. 16, 2008</i></font> 
					</div>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The Immigration Department has admitted tertiary enrolments are failing to meet state and territory demands for graduates in mining, construction and nursing, despite an overhaul of the skilled migration system to meet the labour shortage.</p>
<p>The surge in vocational education and training and intensive English-language courses for overseas students was in areas &ldquo;which appear to be outside those demanded&rdquo;, senior Immigration official Peter Speldewinde told a Brisbane conference. </p>
<p>The skilled immigration category was revamped last year to give greater emphasis to speaking English and developing skills among the tens of thousands of overseas students who now go on to form a key plank of the permanent skilled migration program every year. </p>
<p>Registered nurses, dentists, engineers, radiographers, urban planners, occupational therapists, electricians, bakers, bricklayers, mechanics, carpenters and chefs are among the top 20 occupational shortage areas identified by the states and territories. </p>
<p>But Immigration Department data shows overseas students under the skilled immigration category are flocking instead into hospitality management, welfare studies, hairdressing, accounting, cookery and computing. </p>
<p>There were almost 11,000 course commencements in hospitality, almost 2000 in welfare studies and almost 1500 in hairdressing, all winning valuable points towards permanent residency. </p>
<p>Mr Speldewinde, the department&rsquo;s skilled-migration director, told educators at the conference last Friday that it was &ldquo;clear there are not so much loopholes, but areas in which (earning) points probably stimulate people to go down certain paths&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly the Migrant Occupation on Demand List (under which migrants get points toward permanent residency) is driving very, very strongly migrants&rsquo; choices,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Mr Speldewinde said the system was under review to conform with Immigration Minister Chris Evans&rsquo;s aim of ensuring the selection of high-quality skilled migrants who will more directly address labour market shortages. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The focus is on quality, not quantity,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Two of the key architects of last year&rsquo;s reforms, Monash University demographer Bob Birrell, and National Institute of Labour Studies director Sue Richardson, yesterday described as a mixed success the effort to recruit skilled migrants instead of educating younger Australians. </p>
<p>Dr Birrell told The Australian &ldquo;the surge in skilled migration program is not delivering the skills needed in mining and construction industries, and that&rsquo;s the Government&rsquo;s main concern&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;More than half the skilled immigrants are settling in Sydney and Melbourne,&rdquo; not in Queensland and Western Australia where they are needed, he said. </p>
<p>Dr Birrell &mdash; a fierce critic of aspects of the migration program &mdash; said that despite the sobering assessment from Mr Speldewinde, Australia was &ldquo;likely to get better-equipped migrants and it&rsquo;s a good thing Labor has stuck by this initiative of former (Coalition) minister (Kevin) Andrews&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The acknowledgement the system is not serving the country is quite striking, as is vocational education overtaking higher education because it&rsquo;s an easier and cheaper route to permanent residency,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Professor Richardson told The Australian she was concerned that more than half our population growth was now coming from migration rather than births.<br>

			<p>Australia and NZ have a combined population of 25 million at this point, half of that EU figure of 50 million African immigrant (workers?) by 2050.<br>
If you look at the problems the US, England, the EU and Canada. All of our situations are unquie, we here in Australia have the most populous Muslim country in the world (Indonesia with 250 million+, who we are in an arms race with) on our northern coast who literally hate us(see Bali bombings, East Timor intervention, recent Prime Minister John howard not invited to region talks).<br>
This is why we are a staunch US ally, be we hope you&rsquo;ll come to our aid if needed, and this is why we need you to be strong.</p>
<p>It looks like Australia is on the same path as England, perhaps 10-20 years behind. We are importing so many genetic problems.<br>
Yet we can only discuss genetics on the physical level.<br>
We&rsquo;ve imported 300,000 African refugees in the last 10 years for instances and the UN is always telling us it is not enough. <br>
Our infrastructure can only handle so many people the water reserves here in Melb were 65% 3yrs ago, 50% last yr and at 30% now.<br>
And the average Ozzie like the rest of the world is just trying to stay employed, pay the mortage and put gas in the tank.<br>
And is really unaware of what is really happening in terms of immigration.<br>
We collectively probably know more about Brittany Spears commings and goings.</p>

			<p>&#8220;failing to meet demand for graduates&#8221;</p>
<p>Guess what?  Shortages are the natural state of things. Nature has to have governance somewhere, to place limitations on our insatiable appetites.</p>
<p>If you have shortages, it just means you produce within your means.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Oh, what a ferocious critic indeed.  It&rsquo;s not that 300,000 are coming annually, it&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;re going to Sydney and Melbourne, not Queensland where they&rsquo;re &#8220;needed.&#8221;  </p>

<p>Please note that most of the jobs listed above actually plan, build and maintain the country. In other words, they are essential to infrastructure and maintaining the physical standard of living we have achieved in the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Immigration Department data shows overseas students under the skilled immigration category are flocking instead into hospitality management, welfare studies, hairdressing, accounting, cookery and computing.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the exception of accounting and perhaps the rather ambiguous &#8220;computing&#8221; (it could mean anything from programming to simple data entry), the skills listed above are NOT necessary to the continuation of society.</p>
<p>If the experiment of unfettered immigration ends with an immigrant skilled in hair dressing instead of engineering, I think no more need be said regarding its failure.</p>

			<p>For anyone considering fleeing Post-America for Australia&hellip; DON&rsquo;T BOTHER!</p>
<p>Australia is committing suicide, too! </p>
<p> With hundreds of thousands of South African whites having arrived in Australia in the past decade or so&hellip;surely telling horror stories (confidentially, and in hushed tones, of course) of what it&rsquo;s like to be outnumbered by non-whites&hellip;.   It&rsquo;s incomprehensible that Australia would allow, much less encourage, this brown tsunami to crash onto its beautiful shores.<br>
And they&rsquo;re worried about the death of their coral reefs?</p>
<p>Just google &#8220;Why I&rsquo;m Fleeing South Africa&#8221;, by Anne Paton, if you want to know more about SA.  But note the date: it was written before things got REALLY bad.  And have a good giggle over Mrs. Paton&rsquo;s goody-two-shoes little ending for the article&hellip;lets her keep her &#8216;liberal cred.&rsquo;   </p>

			<p>&ldquo;The focus is on quality, not quantity,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>If they sincerely desired quality and not quantity they would simply reintroduce the white Australia policy of the past.  Anything else is merely one of many ways to commit suicide.</p>

			<p>&#8220;white Australia policy of the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was watching a TV show one time about immigration in the past, both here and abroad in the West. This show talked about how here in the US, immigration policies back in the past were racist because they allowed mostly only whites to immigrate. It then spoke about Austalia&rsquo;s immigration past and their &#8220;white only policy&#8221; at the time, with the same drivel about it being racist. It&rsquo;s funny but today, not in the past but today, all non-white countries allow little or no immigration of other races. Japan does not for example allow immigration of anyone not of Japanese ancesty. Why is it that when whites don&rsquo;t allow other races, it&rsquo;s racist but when non-whites don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not racist,  and that&rsquo;s a-ok?</p>

			<p>I just got through reading &#8220;Why I&rsquo;m leaving South Africa.&#8221; I have NO tears to shed for this woman for she and her late husband were the same White liberals that made S.A. the hell hole it is now. They campained for Nelson Mandela and the downfall of White rule. I just wish her husband had lived to see and suffer the results. And what does this coward do, she &#8220;flees&#8221; to England where she&rsquo;ll no dought start the same non-sence there. She should be made to go back to S.A and suffer her fate that she herself brought about!!!!</p>

			<p>&#8220;All of our situations are unquie, we here in Australia have the most populous Muslim country in the world&#8221;</p>
<p>At least the Mexicans are not muslims, if they were we&rsquo;d be done for!</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve(Australia) imported 300,000 African refugees in the last 10 years for instances and the UN is always telling us it is not enough&#8221;</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the UN also known as the &#8220;Useless Nations&#8221; mind it&rsquo;s own business and stop telling countries what they &#8220;need&#8221; to do regarding immigration. I just wish we&rsquo;d throw the UN out of the US. Australia needs to bring back it&rsquo;s &#8220;white policy&#8221;. </p>
