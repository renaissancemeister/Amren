<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But amid excitement over Mr. Obama&rsquo;s historic candidacy and the chance that the country might choose an African-American president within a matter of days, there is an unmistakable sense of anxiety among blacks here that something will go wrong, that victory will slip away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to throw out votes,&rdquo; said Larone Wesley, a 53-year-old black Vietnam veteran. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say exactly how, but they are going to accomplish that quite naturally. I&rsquo;m so afraid for my friend Obama. I look at this through the eyes of the &lsquo;60s, and I feel there ain&rsquo;t no way they&rsquo;re going to let him make it.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Well, the ONLY way Obama has a chance is if a whole bunch of white people vote for him.  So the only ones &#8220;taking it away&#8221; are the people alienating white voters!!</p>

			<p>So far all the voter fraud, and there has a ton of it, has been perpetrated by pro-Obama forces. They are the ones to keep an eye - they will do whatever it takes to get Obama - and if he should lose, they have threatened violence in the streets.</p>

			<p>What they are really worried about is&hellip;.voter fraud, after all most blacks will vote more than once thanks to ACORN, backed by obamanation&hellip;&hellip;they know that it&rsquo;s the ONLY way he can win&hellip;.plus they paid illegals to vote as well, and took names off of cemetery stones&hellip;.the dead are voting strong this year!!</p>

			<p>I just wish whites were as coherent as Mr. Wesley believes we are. But I still hope we can slam the brakes on Obama and, given thoughts recently expressed by the black community, trigger an Africanized response by many blacks.</p>

			<p>Curses!!!  Mr. Wesley is on to my plan!</p>
<p>But it matters not!  Events have progressed too far for even a wily Vietnam vet like Mr. Wesley to stop them!</p>
<p>My hordes of hooded minions are already sweeping down upon voting places in majority black neighborhoods across the land!  My nefarious agents in law enforcement are already rounding up and intimidating likely voters!  I&rsquo;ve arranged to quadrupal the potency of all drugs sold in the ghetto this weekend, to ensure maximum befuddlement!!  Supplies of anti-retroviral medications have been cut off!!!  Fleets of futuristic jet bombers stand ready to seed the clouds with dry ice to create a steady, icy-cold rain on November 4th.  And my lackies on the Boards of KFC and Miller will make sure that huge discounts on fried chicken and malt liquor distract the bruthas from voting!!!</p>
<p>I WILL prevail!</p>
<p>BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!</p>

			<p>I hold the MSM responsible for this. They have built up the hopes of these easily swayed, naturally excitable people to think that the magic mulatto can&rsquo;t possibly lose, and they haven&rsquo;t pointed out that the black people in this country are a minority of about 15% of the total population, and that even with the addition of the liberals, fools and delusionals there is only the slightest chance of Obama winning.<br>
Naturally when he loses the idea that the republicans &#8220;stole the election again&#8221; is going to make the rounds and hit the rumor mills and cause widespread rioting, mayhem and tragedy.</p>

			<p>Amreners should take time to read the entire article. It highlights paranoia regarding every aspect of the election, ranging from fraudulent vote counts to power outages to election day bus shutdowns. In back of it all is the idea that &#8220;somebody&#8221; is trying to keep black votes from being counted. I don&rsquo;t think anybody will need three guesses to figure out who that &#8220;somebody&#8221; is. No matter how paranoid the black concerns, of course, they&rsquo;re never called &#8220;racist.&#8221; That would be racist in itself.</p>

			<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re going to throw out votes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d better throw out votes!</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and a potentially critical host of other non-existent, unqualified, or multiple-registered voters need their votes invalidated; and ACORN agents and fraudulent voters need to face severe federal penalties for breaking the law and undermining our election process.    </p>
<p>With all this early voting, electronic balloting, and over-simplified, under-scrutinized voter registration (all encouraged by the Democrats), the blacks may have to postpone their destructive post-election extravaganzas indefinately while Boards of Election struggle once again to sort things out.</p>
<p>It may take some time to insure that the legitimate Flintstones and Rubbles haven&rsquo;t been unfairly disenfranchised.       </p>

			<p>There is going to be trouble this election.  I can feel it in my bones.  Friends of mine are starting to notice troubling signs&hellip;.like local gun stores doing far more business than they usually do.  Whites buying supplies&hellip;food, water, and other equipment&hellip;.stocking up their Justin Cases.</p>
<p>The media has portrayed an Obama win as a virtual certainty.  But it doesn&rsquo;t match the reality of the situation.  The reality is Obama does not have anywhere near the support among democrats needed to win.  It fluctuates between 75% and 80%.  Prior elections where the democrat almost won, had support in the 90&rsquo;s.  Many democrats (25 million if you believe what they have to say) plan to vote for McCain to keep Obama out no matter what.  No candidate can win under those circumstances.  No matter how much the media lies, protects and supports them.</p>
<p>The MSM polls show a clear advantage for Obama.  But every uncontrolled poll that protects against ballot stuffing, shows a LANDSLIDE victory for McCain.  Good examples are the polls done of our military, polls on the Drudge Report, and (most damning of all) the AOL straw poll.  This last tends to have several hundred thousand people broken up by state.  More importantly, the demographic of AOL users is just left of center.  Unlike Obama, McCain doesn&rsquo;t employ a legion of malcontents to stuff online polls and blanket Youtube with propaganda.  In any event, it would be VERY labor intensive to do so.   Week after week, that polls has shown a landslide victory for McCain.</p>
<p>But what REALLY should have Obama worried is the early voting in california.  He has spent incredible amounts of time, money and effort to try and get his supporters to register new people and vote early.  Despite this, almost exactly half of the 200,000 or so people who have already voted in california, are republican.  In the most liberal state in the US, that is problematic.  Obama should be 20 points ahead in that count.  He&rsquo;s not.  Even more shocking is if the percentage of democrats who plan to vote McCain is true, it means McCain is actually quite far ahead in california.  Definitely something to think about.</p>
<p>Next week is going to be an awakening for blacks and communists of all stripes.  They&rsquo;ve been told over and over again that they have this election in the bag.  That they are taking over and soon afterward, the revlotuion will replace democracy.  They are about to lose and lose badly.</p>
<p>The question is&hellip;.will they accept that?  If not, what will it mean?  It could mean civil war.</p>

			<p>Steve Sailer covered the 2000 &#8220;disenfranchisement.&#8221;<br>
Community organizers instructed black voters to be sure to punch every page or their ballots would be invalidated. The blacks did punch every page, and every candidate on every page, Democrat and Republican.<br>
26,000 votes would have given Gore the election. He lost by 500 votes in Florida, losing the 27 electoral votes. And this happened because of the low IQ of blacks, not because of a white conspiracy. <br>

			<p>Anything the media or Blacks say   &mdash;   just believe the opposite of.  The fact that he&rsquo;s the Democratic Party candidate for President at all indicates that it is liberal, idiotic, lemming-like White people who have allowed a White-hating Black radical Muslim with a wife in the same league to get this far.  Just a few moments ago I noticed Hussein Obama&rsquo;s picture on the front page of New York magazine in one of those below-facial-level looking-up-to-the-sky man of destiny poses, and also on the cover of &#8216;Men&rsquo;s Health&rsquo; and &#8216;Rolling Stone&rsquo;.  His candidacy has been a media project for the last 2 years.  Anyone with 2 eyes, a little intelligence and an awakened mind can see what &#8220;They&#8221; are planning for Obama - The Presidency of the United States.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Many blacks fear &ldquo;they&rdquo; won&rsquo;t allow Obama to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee, isn&rsquo;t that surprising?  You mean there are paranoid blacks in this country?  I never would have guessed in a million years.</p>
<p>I mean, they accused us of blowing up the levees in N.O., introducing, dope and aids in their neighborhoods to kill them off,  actively work toward purposely reducing all their scores they get on millions of tests, I mean, when were not plotting to keep them from getting into college with the flimsy excuse they&rsquo;re too dumb, when they positive they&rsquo;re not, because they&rsquo;re low test scores have been reduced by honkies too.</p>
<p>I mean, they wouldn&rsquo;t need outcome based education, headstart, or a dumbed down curriculum if whites weren&rsquo;t working night and day holding them aback.  There&rsquo;s a million other things too, but one of the worst is shooting the nose off the Spinyx so nobody would know that blacks built the pyramids, and the entire history of the world has been rewritten by whites to exclude every single one of the black geniuses who invented everything the white man took credit for.</p>
<p>And those are but a scant few of the injustices and obstructionist tactics aimed at blacks.  To name them all would take a book 8 feet thick. </p>
<p>Now they say that, &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got a fine black man who has nearly all the votes in the country, but we jes know sumhow we gonna get cheated agin.  Jes lak always.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Blacks always vote Democrat, if they remember to vote at all.  If Obama is elected, he will be elected by Whites.  </p>
<p>If McCain is elected, he&rsquo;ll probably enact the same policies as Obama, and everyone on Fox news will pretend not to notice.  Because he&rsquo;s a war hero.</p>

			<p>My guess? Maybe it&rsquo;ll have to do with the fact that Obama is not a natural born US citizen and, thus, is not legally qualified to hold the office he seeks. It&rsquo;s just another one of those curious &#8220;accidents&#8221; (like Pearl Harbor) that &#8220;they&#8221; forgot to watch out for earlier.</p>
<p>If it makes Blacks feel any better, we feel your pain. The system is even more rigged against Whites. So, cheer up! It&rsquo;s all a big puppet show anyway.</p>

			<p>You see, blacks are so used to &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; and getting this or that just for being black, being involved in something without the perks makes them upset or nervious!  Who is &#8220;they&#8221;? The voting population as a whole? Or are they referring to &#8220;whitey&#8221;? Crackers? Honkies? If he loses, I bet its whities fault!!!! I am so sick of this I could puke!</p>

<p>Of course, to be fair about it, a lot of these people aren&rsquo;t too sure about their actual ages or who their parents are.</p>

			<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ve seen too many movies, but I also don&rsquo;t expect &#8220;them&#8221; to let Obama become President.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there&rsquo;s a very high probability that if he&rsquo;s elected he&rsquo;ll change the present cozy relationship the U.S. has with a certain nation in the Middle East. Comprende?</p>
<p>I also think there&rsquo;s a very high probability that he&rsquo;ll bring in a sea change in government itself, and especially in the Pentagon, State Department and our intelligence agencies.  There are too many careers and too much money on the line for some to risk this.</p>
<p>But,then, what do I know?  Again, probably just too many movies.</p>

			<p>My guess? Maybe it&rsquo;ll have to do with the fact that Obama is not a natural born US citizen and, thus, is not legally qualified to hold the office he seeks. It&rsquo;s just another one of those curious &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; (like Pearl Harbor) that &ldquo;they&rdquo; forgot to watch out for earlier.</p>

<p>Yep. In fact, I came across this article today</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Vieira/edwin84.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswithviews.com/Vieira/edwin84.htm</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by far the best one on the subject of Obama Citizenship, or lack of it, that I&rsquo;ve come across.</p>
<p>If he can become the President illegally he&rsquo;ll stay President illegally.  My guess is that those controlling Obama know that he&rsquo;s an Illgeal Alien and are putting him in the White House for the same reason they allowed millions of Illegal Aliens to enter the Country; to rub it in the face of those in the U.S.A. they are busy replacing.  They figure, a Country of Illegal Aliens needs an Illegal Alien for President.  He&rsquo;ll probably hang on to the job like Castro or the Pope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad and a little scary, but it won&rsquo;t work. Of that I am certain.  Still, it will do lots of damage before it&rsquo;s over. No form of Socialism has ever worked. But, if it has ruined every place that has had it, what is going to happen if that place turns out to be, The World. As in &#8220;World Socialism&#8221;?</p>

			<p>&#8220;But amid excitement over Mr. Obama&rsquo;s historic candidacy and the chance that the country might choose an African-American president within a matter of days, there is an unmistakable sense of anxiety among blacks here that something will go wrong, that victory will slip away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet again, what I see here is the Marxstream Media (The MM) attempting to do two things.</p>
<p>The first, is to excuse an Obama loss as &#8220;reasonably understandable,&#8221; because whites were too &#8220;racist&#8221; and/or &#8220;ignorant&#8221; to vote for him and what they see as our &#8220;best interests.&#8221; Our &#8220;best interests,&#8221; being an auto-genocide through: Marxism, miscegenation, Muslims, and multiculturalism, from their point of view.</p>
<p>Second, would be the MM collective farm&rsquo;s realization that when Comrade BO loses this election there will likely be massive nonwhite riots, in no small part because they have so deified him, that nonwhites think he can&rsquo;t be defeated. Thus, they will have &#8220;washed&#8221; their hands free of any responsibility in those animalistic outbursts by nonwhites, that they helped generate by being &#8220;predictive&#8221; of this. They will have &#8220;warned&#8221; whites, that &#8220;yes&#8221; they &#8220;should have&#8221; voted for &#8220;change,&#8221; if only symbolically so, to avoid this outcome. </p>
<p>Moreover, they will have a ready made excuse for their pets acting in the most feral of manners.</p>
<p>They will repeatedly ask: &#8216;Can you really blame them&hellip;..?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>Obama is not a natural born citizen until he can provide evidence. BTW, Intrade has picked up some action on Hillary Clinton for President 2008 based on her returning as the Democratic nominee. That would require the government to throw out this election and start a new one.  </p>

			<p>As far as the comments about Obamas&rsquo; Citizenship go, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter where he was born. The constitution provides two ways that a person can be born a citizen. One is to be born on American Soil, and the other is to be born to an American Citizen. Only one of your parents has to be a citizen. Obamas&rsquo; mother was a U.S. Citizen, so regardless of where he was born, so is he.</p>
<p>Now for everyone on this site who seems so angry about a possible Obama Administration, or those who are in denial that it could happen, (I personally feel that those two views are interconnected) let me say this, CHILL OUT!!! An Obama/Reid/Pelosi Junta would be the be the best possible thing for our cause. I recently read an article where a guy pointed out that White Nationalism isn&rsquo;t really a movement, but wrather we&rsquo;re a counter culture. He&rsquo;s exactly right. At the moment, we come to sites like this and spout our views, but we really don&rsquo;t actively pursue any real goals. Obama will change all of that. White People all around America will immediately wake up after election day, others will come to our side in the insuing years when Obama, Reid, and Pelosi further devestate our economy with bad economic policies, and then give what little wealth we have left to minorities. David Duke said that Obama would provide a great visual aid for how Whites have lost control of this country. I WANT OBAMA TO WIN!!! McCain isn&rsquo;t going to do anything to help our cause. He&rsquo;ll support amnesty the same as Obama, and his economic policies wont be any better, and worst of all, he will just perpetuate the false idea that this is still a White Controlled Country. We need Obama. He will change the White Nationalist Culture into the White Nationalist Movement. We need the revolution to happen now. We are steadily declining in population, while the lower races are quickly multiplying. In a few decades we wont be able to take back control of our country without losing most of it, and by then we will have lost control of the government, military, and economy. We need this now. I understand why you don&rsquo;t want Obama to win. I hate the idea of a Liberal Black Marxist becoming president. Just the thought of him and his family living in our White House makes me cringe, but this is an example of how we need to loose the battle so we can win the war. It&rsquo;s like in chess when you sacrifice a major piece so you can gain better position. It&rsquo;s a gamble. It&rsquo;s a big gamble, but we have no other option. If the revolution doesn&rsquo;t happen now, when will it? I know that deep down most of you agree with me. Your head tells you that Obama should win, but your heart says McCain. Listen to your head. That&rsquo;s what separates us the most from the lower races. We are smarter. We can strategize better. Let them have their little victory. We&rsquo;ll have our big one later. VOTE OBAMA 08 so we can VOTE JARED TAYLOR 12.</p>

If Obama is ineligible, then the only place to make money on inside info would be at Intrade. This could get interesting if some news breaks tomorrow. </p>

			<p>I can understand people&rsquo;s dislike of John McCain.  He makes me cringe when he talks about civil rights leaders being patriots or calling Senator Kennedy a great man.  But if your not voting for him so that a real conservative will run in 2012, you&rsquo;d better rethink that strategy.  If Obama wins and the Congress gets a supermajority of Democrats, I don&rsquo;t think conservatism will ever make a comeback because of the alien amnesty that will happen.  </p>

			<p>People here should stop accusing Barack Obama of being a Socialist or a Marxist. He is neither. He is completely owned by Wall Street. And if elected, he will attempt to destabilize and overthrow the Leftist Hugo Chavez which is I admantly oppose. </p>
<p>A majority of White Americans support Socialist programs such as Social Security and Medicare which takes care of elderly White American.</p>
<p>Bill Gates and Larry Ellison and other billionaires should be  heavily taxed. Both made their billions by stealing the wages of Native Born White Americans. &#8220;Marxist&#8221; Barack Obama will make it easier for the billionaires to steal our wages.</p>
<p>Here is another Socialist program that a majority of White Americans support:the student loan program.</p>
<p>Barack Obama should be opposes because he is hell-bent on making Native Born White Americans a very small racial minority in America and he is a friend of Wall Street and  Corporations in general.</p>

<p>I would say that several of us have noticed exactly what you&rsquo;re pointing out, guy, plus two of the biggest mouths have also been kept under wraps:  Jeremiah Wright and Michelle Obama&hellip;..especially Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>And Obama is one of the most important figures that is contained somewhat, also.  We know nothing about his past grades and writings, his medical history, or his narcotic use.  They too are all kept hidden.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s allowed to recite his pre-written script, which he has memorized pretty well, but notice when he departs from that and relies on intelligent rebuttals or assertions to problems or challenges he comes up with some of the most damaging indictments of what he&rsquo;s all about.  &#8220;Spreading the wealth around,&#8221; is just one example.</p>

<p>They avoid us the way all Whites avoid certain neighborhoods; and for the same reason.  Danger.<br>
The bad neighborhoods are dangerous because they are a threat to our survival.<br>
And because Obamatons and the rest of the Liberal-Left simply can not live in Reality, exposure to those who do is just as much a threat to their survival.<br>
Sooner or later Reality will win.  It always does.<br>
I just hope that we&rsquo;ll still be here when it finally triumphs.</p>

I&rsquo;ve even had professors wear Obama buttons to class one of them proudly announced that he had voted early and that he had voted for Obama.  Also, some professors are even giving extra credit to students if you can prove that you voted (for example, by getting your hand stamped or by bringing in an &#8220;I voted&#8221; sticker).  It&rsquo;s pretty obvious who they expect you to vote for.   </p>

			<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to throw out votes,&rdquo; said Larone Wesley, a 53-year-old black Vietnam veteran. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say exactly how, but they are going to accomplish that quite naturally. I&rsquo;m so afraid for my friend Obama. I look at this through the eyes of the &lsquo;60s, and I feel there ain&rsquo;t no way they&rsquo;re going to let him make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throw out votes? The creature Obama the invented man, was pushed through a fixed system. How could this fool Larone Wesley think otherwise? </p>
<p>Obama has been given enormous amounts of money, hyped by the Marxist media, has had his real birth certificate disappeared and probably a false one in the vault of the state of Hawaii  (most likely he is an illegal alien).<br>
 <br>
This must be a farce and this character Wesley must a product of a distorted imagination by this   Susan Saulny, of no less the liberal New York Times.</p>
<p>No votes for the mulatto will be thrown out; most likely the dead, cartoon characters and other illusionary votes will be counted in this Marxist favor thanks to Communist party U.S.A.   (I.e. Acorn)<br>

<p>Knowing you are a WASP must really sting.  I mean sting enough to make you vote against your best self interests.  That&rsquo;s what self hatred does.  The White Guilt campaign of the past 40+ years has worked well on you.</p>

<p>Posted by Jupiter at 7:33 AM on October 30 </p>
<p>Socialism has worked well in every European country I can think of, including one I lived in for several years - Slovenia.  The problem is that the EU has had a policy of replacing the declining White populations of Europe with non-Europeans.  But socialism has worked well in Europe in my view for a number of special reasons.  Two are that they have not had to raise and maintain large military, due to the US funding and heading NATO for 60 years, AND that Sweden, like all other European nations have up to now had largely indigenous White population majorities who can easily see the sense in taking care of all their cousins via their government.  These European socialist states have also been able to mix capitalism in very successfully as the merchant tradition and the profit motive has always been part of the European economic model.  A reawakening of nationalism is occuring in Europe in a way that is not likely to happen here.  And Europe is well ahead of us now in infrastructure improvements and energy intelligent technologies.</p>
<p>We ought to wise up and stop hammering socialism.  Socialism can be a great way to protect and enhance your own racial and ethnic group.  What good would it do to once again be a 90% White nation that allows millions of our out of work brethren wander the country starving like we did in the 1930s because we hate the idea of helping anyone but ourselves?  <br>

			<p>The &#8220;spreading of the wealth&#8221; around is an African, tribal idea. Of ourse it resonates with blacks; it is a promise from the BigMan that he will reward their loyalty with the spoils ripped off from whitey. It is not an idea of a society heading into the 21st century with confidence of economic growth. Societies on the winning side of history arent going to be worrying about the welfare benefits of unproductive yet demanding people. They are thinking of ways of shedding them in the least painful way possible; ideally by training and investment but if that doesn&rsquo;t work, well, that doesn&rsquo;t work. Do you think this guy Obama would have any resonance in any society that does not have a substantial fraction of blacks? Societies that don&rsquo;t have our unique history of slavery and appeasement of the underclass will simply be bewildered.  The USA under Obama will of course be tested as Joe-boy averred. It will also be laughed at by any self-respecting people.If anything, the Obama will not produce some universal appreciation for the USA, rather its opposite. </p>

<p>As much a citizen as the seditious La Raza Mencha advocates that hopped a border falsly declaring themselves American Indians no doubt. When we devalue American citizenship to simply a plain piece of paper that permits non-Americans to squat on a piece of land and rob America of it&rsquo;s culture, heritage, etc&hellip; then we have a broken citizenship process. I&rsquo;d plop Obama in with the illegals personally for all purposes other than getting that chain migration piece of paper in hand and a SS number to go with it. And judging by your words, in my opinion, America is broken in more ways than one. We couldn&rsquo;t be more different my &#8220;fellow&#8221; wasp.</p>

<p>You might be&hellip; but I am also a WASP and voting AGAINST Obama. Not because he&rsquo;s Black. But because I simply don&rsquo;t trust his marxist/communist leanings. He TALKS a great game, to be sure. But has no track record. No relevant practical government experience. Has been an unknown until just a few years ago. A person the MEDIA is so anxious to foist on Americans. Did you ever question the WHYs of any of this before making up your mind? Or is THINKING beyond your mental capabilities?</p>

			<p>Rudy, I and many others are also frustrated to no end with what appears to be the willful blindness, if not merely the thoroughly brainwashed state of far too many more who do not see the danger that has been eating away at our society for a long time, and which seeks no less than our total destruction&hellip;</p>
<p>I, too, hope that white people will come out of the coma so many (thankfully, not all!) are in.  </p>
<p>I have serious doubts that shock therapy is the right treatment, however.  If a shock is too great it is often repressed and denied.  If something occurs that doesn&rsquo;t fit one&rsquo;s view, it is more likely that people will rationalize what harm befalls them according to the perspective with which they are already programmed.</p>
<p>Not only is deprogramming not a simple thing (most of the time), but allowing a major problem to get dramatically worse is in no way a step toward making them better.  </p>
<p>Losing battles, especially major ones, is NOT the way to win any war.  </p>
<p>At the same time, in large-scale conflict many battles are often fought simultaneously.  Some are large, some are small.  Nobody wins all battles, and not all are necessary to even engage, let alone win.  </p>
<p>And sometimes things do look darkest before the dawn. </p>
<p>I agree with the basic premise that there is something far more important than the outcome of any single contest, &amp; that is the state of the culture of white preservation (that it is now a &#8220;counter-culture&#8221; is evidence of how much ground we&rsquo;ve lost already), the realization that we as a people are under attack and the spirit that sustains us in our struggle for survival.  But there is no way in Hell that I will ever support the takeover of American government by the likes of Obama and his pals &amp; puppet-masters.  Though I may well be forced to watch it happen, it will not be because I voted for it.  </p>

<p>Well Mr. 2:48 AM on October 30, I must give you a well deserved and heartfelt touché on that one!</p>
<p>How could I have missed so obvious a point?</p>
<p>In fact, I would say that of all the immediate racial/sociopolitical problems we face in this country, Mexicans and their shambling &#8220;stealth&#8221; invasion of this country are the greatest single threat we must overcome. The other four I mentioned above are pernicious dangers, but they pale in comparison to the demographic shift these criminal and alien peons are presenting us with. In twenty years, they have gone from about 10 million or so in number to 40 million, with 12 to 20 million more here illegally and &#8220;undocumented;&#8221; that isn&rsquo;t just a problem, it is a looming disaster.</p>

He&rsquo;ll support amnesty the same as Obama, and his economic policies wont be any better; <b>worst of all, McCain will just perpetuate the false idea that this is still a White Controlled Country.  </b> Just the thought of Obama and his family living in our White House makes me cringe, but this is an example of how we need to loose the battle so we can win the war.

Mr. Winston Smith presents a very persuasive argument.  Great post!  Although I do not plan to vote for either fraud being offered us, Mr. Smith has almost won me over to his position on this.  </p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Smith, whites have been too comfortable and too self-assured for too long in assuming themselves to be still in charge here.  We need to realize that we are NOT!  We have taken our majority status too much for granted,  as if it&rsquo;s permanent.  And for many whites, any other status is inconceivable. </p>
<p>Hopefully, an Obama win  will pacify the blacks and will galvanize the whites. I&rsquo;m not looking forward to it, but nothing is all bad.</p>
<p>That was a very sensible post from Jupiter too.  Social Security and Medicare are beneficial and I don&rsquo;t want my elderly relatives to lose them (or be forced to go out and clean the streets as some here have advocated).  I don&rsquo;t know if Obama is beholden to the radicals or to Wall St.  But I do know know that all the Pavlovian knee-jerk ranting of some hysterical  so-called &#8220;conservatives&#8221; is putting me off. The subject has to be approached sensibly, not emotionally. Even so, I couldn&rsquo;t vote  for Obama;  but ranting against him  (or for McCain) won&rsquo;t get us anywhere.</p>

&#8220;As far as the comments about Obamas&rsquo; Citizenship go, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter where he was born. The constitution provides two ways that a person can be born a citizen. One is to be born on American Soil, and the other is to be born to an American Citizen. Only one of your parents has to be a citizen. Obamas&rsquo; mother was a U.S. Citizen, so regardless of where he was born, so is he.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is my understanding that this does not apply to minors. Obama&rsquo;s mother was 17 when he was born and, therefore, could not transfer her citizenship status to him. Then there is the question of Obama&rsquo;s citizenship status changing when his mother remarried and they moved to Indonesia. Lastly, there is also a question of fraud with respect to the information she provided on the original notification of birth. However, I&rsquo;m not an attorney. Maybe someone who is more knowledgeable of the law can comment. In any case, it&rsquo;ll probably end with a &#8220;trial of the century&#8221; that&rsquo;ll make the O.J.

<p>Socialistic policies can only work in societies that are racially homogeneous. In racially homogeneous societies, their is a greater sense of an extended family.</p>
<p>In the US socialistic policies subsidize the race replacement of Native Born White Americans. Steve Sailer made an interesting point a few years back on vdare.com that,possibly, the intent  behind post-1965 immigration policy is to create a dysfunctional social welfare state in the US with the goal of completely discreting socialist/social welfare polices that would othrwise be supported in a racially homogeneous society. Sailer is definitely on to something.</p>
<p>What I am attacking is the insane  free market views of the some of the White Nationalist who post here. What they are advocating is something quite possibly worse than hell. Most Native Born White Americans would never support these draconian social policies if push came to shove.</p>
<p>A few more great achievements of Socialism:1)abolition of child labor;2)eight hour work week;3)Social Seceurity(a majority of White Americans opposed handing over Social Security to the free market(Wall Street privatization).</p>
<p>I despise Barck Obama. However, the White Nationalist who post on Ameican Renassaince are evacuating all meaning of the terms Socialist and Marxist. Barack Obama is neither. They just can&rsquo;t accept the fact that a pro-capitalist/pro-corporate presidential candidate is hell-bent on the race replacement of Native Born White Americans. The only socialist in the presidential campaign is Ralph Nader. There isn&rsquo;t a snowballs chance in hell that he will recieve  a penny from Wall Street for his presidential campaign. But Barack Obama has taken millions from Wall Street. The socialist Nader unfortunately is hell-bent on the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans. Nader also supports the legalization of homosexual marriage.</p>
