						<p>The Democrats believe they can take Florida on November 4 &mdash; but they are facing a battle to overcome prejudice that extends deep into the heart of the Sunshine State.</p>
<p>Many Cuban Americans like Laura Vianello have not forgiven the Democratics</p>
<p>Racism is notoriously widespread in regions away from the traditionally Republican state&rsquo;s major cities, such as the Panhandle in the north.</p>
<p>A seventh-grade school teacher there was recently suspended for writing on a blackboard that Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;Change&#8221; slogan stood for &#8220;Come Help A N***** Get Elected&#8221;.</p>
<p>Senator Obama is pinning his hopes on the more cosmopolitan areas of the south, and getting black voters to turn out in unprecedented numbers in order to take a state that has proven key in past contests.</p>
<p>On Monday, as he embarked on a two-day trip to Tampa and Miami, he launched a drive to get voters to place their ballots early to avoid a repeat of the scandal of 2000 that saw thousands of black people&rsquo;s votes discounted.</p>
<p>However, to take the state he must win support from white, black and Hispanic voters &mdash; and it is not just in the rural areas that he faces an uphill battle against bias based on his race and background.</p>
<p>In Miami and elsewhere across the state, Cuban Americans form a hugely powerful voting bloc that is traditionally Republican, the party most opposed to the hated Castro government in their homeland.</p>
<p>Miguel Saabedra is president of the Vigilia Mambisa organisation for Cuban exiles which staged a street demonstration in the area of the capital known as Little Havana to show support for John McCain.</p>
<p>He and others at the event repeatedly linked Mr Obama with fundamentalist Islam &mdash; a charge that has been levelled against him since the primaries, despite the fact he has been a practising Christian for decades &mdash; and accused him of being a closet Communist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama wants to talk to Castro, he wants to talk to (Venezualan president Hugo) Chavez, he wants to talk to Iran,&#8221; he told Sky News. &#8220;These people don&rsquo;t want to talk to us!</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not because he is black, if Condoleezza Rice was running for president, or Colin Powell, that would be good. I support black people. I have good friends who are black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another demonstrator outside the Versailles restaurant, a focal point for the Cuban American community, waved a placard at passing motorists with a crudely-drawn picture of Mr Obama wearing what looked like a beard, robes and turban below the word &#8220;Evil&#8221;.</p>
<p>Many passing cars tooted their horns in approval and several slowed down to shout encouragement &mdash; although one or two drove past shouting abuse and pro-Obama slogans.</p>
<p>For many Cuban Americans like Laura Vianello, the Democratic party still have not been forgiven for President John F Kennedy&rsquo;s failure to properly back up the Cuban expats who tried to topple the Castro regime in the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.</p>
<p>She lost three uncles in the invasion, a memorial to which stands prominently in the street in Little Havana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most Cubans here in Miami are Republican by tradition. You could put the Devil up there as a candidate and we would vote for him,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Mr Obama has sent four of his top strategists to the Sunshine State and poured money into advertising, with local radio stations regularly broadcasting attacks on Senator McCain on issues such as healthcare and the dire state of the economy.</p>
<p>But it seems that for some in the crucial Cuban American constituency, voting will be based on issues that make winning the arguments an irrelevance.<br>

<p>&#8216;Abuse and pro-Obama slogans&rsquo;? Isn&rsquo;t that a bit redundant? Might abuse, and a pro-Obama slogan, be the same thing?</p>

			<p>Yet another story to demonstrate the utter worthlessness of the term &#8220;Hispanic.&#8221;  While it is true that Cubans speak Spanish, many of the Cubans in South Florida are racially White.  The White Cubans are generally educated and successful. White Cubans are essentially Castilian Spaniards.  They have about as much in common with non-White &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; as black South Africans have in common with the British.  Race explains why those folks don&rsquo;t support Obama - the JFK thing is just an excuse that White Cubans have been using for decades to rationalize their &#8220;Republicanness&#8221; in their increasingly non-White region.</p>
<p>Contrary to what is normally reported, Cubans are not the ethnic group that is primarily responsible for destroying South Florida; that would be the Colombians, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Jamaicans, Haitians, Dominicans, etc.  </p>

			<p>If Cubans haven&rsquo;t forgiven the Democratic Party for their essentially allowing Castro to enslave the Cuban populace in 1959, and a bit later, why in the world would any aware Cuban believe in the Democratic Party of 2008, which is ten times as communist as it was in 1962, for instance??</p>

<p>How odd of Comrade di Paolo, to write the above sentence that way. Why, it is almost as if he approves of the attempted intimidation of those who oppose Comrade BO by those who support him? Does he not realize that Comrade BO is against such tactics by his supporters? He makes this very clear by the way he confronts the more radical elements of his base, when they show up at his spiritually communal services and act so uncouthly. </p>
<p>After all, that isn&rsquo;t what &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221; are supposed to be about.</p>
<p>Get with the program Comrade di Paolo, particularly if you wish to report on such glorious and transcendental events!<br>

<p>A few facts please??  Such as the name of the school, the town, the teacher, a quote from the principal???</p>
<p>Just more anti white racist propaganda from the white hating media, like the stories that &#8220;lynch mobs&#8221; attend McCain Palin events screaming &#8220;kill the terrorist Obama.&#8221;</p>

			<p>My guess?  McCain will win Florida, the Dems know it, and they&rsquo;re greasing the skids for an excuse.</p>
<p>The article mentions 2000.  The best theory for the dimpled and hanging chads is that corrupt black poll workers were doing in south Florida what they do in St. Louis, and that is punching multiple ballots after the polls close.  They probably tried to punch too many at a time, not punching out the chads in some, and only dimpling those at the bottom.</p>

So Cuban-Americans haven&rsquo;t forgotten or forgiven the Democrats.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t relish the &#8216;hot blooded&rsquo; temperment of the hispanic, these people, unlike whites, act with passion from their hearts. They see group interest and act accordingly.</p>
<p>In defense of whites, whites are not allowed to openly engage in such behavior. <br>

<p>Oh that explains why Obama always talks about change but never refers to what kind of change.  It&rsquo;s meant as an acronym.  They need to correct those banners to read &#8220;C.H.A.N.G.E&#8221; not &#8220;CHANGE&#8221;.</p>

			<p>     I live in central Florida about 35 miles northwest of Orlando. I saw one car with an Obama sticker. It had New York plates and was driven by a black woman. There are McCain signs all over, but I haven&rsquo;t seen any of his bumper stickers. There were a number of cars that had them, but they were keyed pretty badly at a local shopping center.</p>

<p>True.  </p>
<p>But racism is in the rural areas too, and it is especially rife within the larger cities.</p>
<p>In Miami, for example, black racism against whites and Hispanics is at crises levels.  Racism by SOME Hispanics against whites is rampant also.  And anti-black racism by Hispanics is almost universal.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the way up the state this same black racism against whites and Hispanics is everywhere one turns.  Blacks just seem to hate everybody.  </p>
<p>To a lessor extent, some Hispanics outside of Miami still hold racist feelings against whites, but, as in Miami, they utterly despise blacks.</p>
<p>The best rule of thumb to use in determining racism is the number of blacks in an area.  Where there is a large number of blacks, there is a LOT of racism, because they just hate everybody.</p>
<p>I guess it could honestly be said that where there are blacks there is anti-white/anti/Hispanic racism.</p>
<p>Black hatred and prejudice is at epidemic levels.  </p>
<p>How racist are they?  Well, they&rsquo;re voting for Obama almost 100%.  If that isn&rsquo;t racism, what is?  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised they used the word &#8220;racism&#8221; in reference to Cubans. They must not have access to American stylebooks which explain that only whites can be &#8220;racist&#8221; or be guilty of &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nonsense. The term &#8220;racism&#8221; today means nothing. Many  people in the panhandle north don&rsquo;t hold the same beliefs as Obama. He&rsquo;s a marxist. As such they don&rsquo;t vote for them. However, this is explained away as racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;A seventh-grade school teacher there was recently suspended for writing on a blackboard that Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;Change&rdquo; slogan stood for &ldquo;Come Help A N***** Get Elected&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>How do you know this teacher was white? This teacher could have easily been black or hispanic. Obviously the teacher was suspended so this shows that this behavior isn&rsquo;t tolerated. If they racist, they would have done nothing to the teacher.</p>

<p>This is from a British newspaper. Exactly how did they come to this conclusion? Did the writer of this article live there. My guess is a big no. He came to the conclusion by listening to the American news media, which lies through its&rsquo; teeth. The truth is, rural Florida is no more racist than anywhere else, just more realist. Just like the British who have to live around large numbers of muslims are more &#8220;realist&#8221; than those that don&rsquo;t.</p>

			<p>I have heard one theory; that if the Clinton Adminstration had ruled in favor of letting Elian Gonzalez stay with his relatives in Florida, Al Gore would have won the state of Florida and the Presidency in the 2000 election.</p>
<p>If the Clinton Administration did allow Elian Gonzalez to stay in the USA, would Cuban-Americans have eased up on their animosity toward the Democrats, because of the way President John F. Kennedy pulled back from supporting the Bay of Pigs attempt to overthrow Castro?</p>
<p>I think the restrictions against Americans traveling to Cuba should be lifted.  As much as I love my country, I resent having my government tell me I cannot go to Cuba and spend money there as a tourist.  But I still think the Clinton Administration was wrong to send Elian Gonzalez back to Cuba!  </p>
<p>This does not mean I condone Fidel Castro&rsquo;s dictatorship.  But as a nation we already have open relations with unfree, dictatorial countries like China and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>I absolutely despised George W. Bush as an idiot not fit to be President.  When Bush is no longer President, I am going to miss the fun of yelling &#8220;George Bush kiss my Tush&#8221; at protest rallies.  In 2000, I dearly wanted Al Gore to win the Presidency.</p>
<p>But as much as I disagree with the majority of the Cuban-American community in Florida, I can still understand why they voted for Bush in 2000.  I can still understand why they do not want the embargo against Cuba to be lifted until Castro is no longer in power.  Contrary to bull**** propaganda put forth by left-wing idiots, Castro&rsquo;s Cuba is not a paradise!  The many Cubans who risk their lives to escape this island nation is one of many proofs of this point.</p>
<p>When Castro took over Cuba, there was a joke that went &#8220;What happened when Fidel Castro shaved his beard?  They found Battista!&#8221;</p>

<p>Not entirely worthless, since as another commenter alluded to, the cover of the &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; label allows these white Cubans to advocate their ethnic interests without being labelled racist.  Not an easy feat these days.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;White&#8221; Cubans turned Miami into a spanish speaking foriegn city. Native Born White Americans-this excludes the &#8220;white&#8221; cubans- were forced to flee Miami and Dade county. </p>
<p>Not only did the &#8220;White&#8221; Cubans transform Miami into a Spanish speaking city they tansformed Miami into one of the most corrupt cities in America.</p>
<p>Cuba never did and still does not pose a threat to America. </p>
<p>Any White Nationalist who has no problem with an American city being taken over by spanish speaking Cuban nationals  is a traitor. Some of you here are definitely flirting with treason.</p>

			<p>Contrary to ignorance, true Cubans are white caucasian European Latinos from Spain who speak their white language Spanish that Central and South America adopted only after the native indian Asian mongoloid migrant reds were defeated 500 yrs ago. </p>
<p>Florida was where America was originally discovered anyway and the oldest settlement city is St Augustine. Cubans returning to America to escape commie marxist Castro was only returning back to a place they originally owned.</p>
<p>It is only natural for Cuban white people who live in America to vote for white candidates. Cuba also had slaves like America and there has alwas been separation of blacks and whites there. White European Cubans from Spain abhorred race mixing with the ex-slave African Cubans. No difference for those in America. </p>
<p>Actually Castro is of Spanish European origin but brainwashed by neocon marxism like so many other caucasians such as Lincoln Lenin Stalin Krushev and most of the Republican party in America.</p>

<p>  I agree racially &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is basically meaningless. After Fidel&rsquo;s communist revolution, the cream of white Cuban society fled to Florida. Some of the recent Cuban immigrants haven&rsquo;t been as successful, but we basically got their entire professional class. These anti-socialist Spanish speaking white people seem unlikely Obama supporters.</p>

			<p>I did note with respect that the Cubans - mostly White Cubans in South Florida were the only people in America with the courage to come out in the streets and oppose the propaganda, victory tour of Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>The idiot, pathetic father of George W. Bush - George Herbert Walker Bush treated Nelson Mandela as the world&rsquo;s savior and gave him total boot licking treatment in the White house in Bush Sr.&rsquo;s efforts to reach out to NW and expand the base of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Bush, Sr&rsquo;s pathetic pandering to the kill White people ANC leader Mandela is one of the reasons Pat Buchanan decided to run and beat down the pathetic, pandering WASP Bush. Sr.</p>
<p>Pandering by rich White elites like the Bushes - it never works.</p>

			<p>When Fidel Castro came to speak at the United Nations in 1961, many Bantus in New York&rsquo;s Harlem, thought he was the Second Coming. I couldn&rsquo;t understand how they could sing hosannas to a man who trampled on civil liberties of Cubans, especially the Cuban Negrito.</p>
<p>Maybe these Bantus should spend about five years in a Cuban prison. When they get out, they&rsquo;ll probably sing &#8220;Dixie&#8221;!</p>

			<p>Turn the &#8220;Idiot Box&#8221;, a.k.a your TV, off!  The seditionists are programming your children&rsquo;s minds.  It&rsquo;s why now in NYC, where I live, white men date everybody EXCEPT white girls.  It&rsquo;s the saddest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The white race is being systematically destroyed, and sometimes I think frankly, we deserve it.</p>

			<p>I did not originate that &#8220;Change&#8221; acronym alluded to earlier.  I made my own some time ago:  C.H.A.N.G.E. = &#8220;Communism Has Already Nuked Great Economies&#8221;</p>
