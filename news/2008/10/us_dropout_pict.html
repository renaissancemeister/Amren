<p>More than half the states have graduation targets that don&rsquo;t make schools get better, the Education Trust says in a report released Thursday in Washington.</p>
<p>One in 4 kids is dropping out of school, a rate that hasn&rsquo;t budged for at least five years. Among minorities, more than 1 in 3 drop out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. is the only industrialized country where youths are less likely than their parents to earn a diploma, the report says, citing data compiled by the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>
<p>High schools are required to meet graduation targets every year as part of the 2002 federal No Child Left Behind Act. But those targets are set by states, and most states allow schools to graduate low percentages of students by saying that any progress, or even the status quo, is acceptable.</p>

			<p>The education industry is between a rock and a hard place.  They complain about &#8220;being behind the rest of the industrial world&#8221; when it comes the educational standards, so they want to raise them.  But they&rsquo;re also worried about the dropout rate.  You can&rsquo;t have both   &mdash;   either you raise the standards, and get a higher dropout rate.  To get a lower dropout rate, you have to lower the standards.</p>

<p>Well, this raises the question as to why it matters or not if all of them drop out.  They&rsquo;re graded, passed, and accredited just by showing up, and they can&rsquo;t read, write, nor can they do simple math, so why on earth does it matter if they stay in school?</p>
<p>In fact, wouldn&rsquo;t teachers have it easier if they all dropped out so they could teach teachable white pupils who want to learn, without having trouble makers around who devolve to their basic tribal roots and form tribes or gangs, whatever they&rsquo;re called nowadays?<br>

			<p>When I graduated from high school a decade ago, all you had to do was make it to 11th grade at which point you could take a basic (junior high level) english course, a civics course, gym twice a week, and then you could just take &#8220;Study hall&#8221; (sleeping on a desk) for a couple of hours then you could leave at lunch time.</p>
<p>If fancy book learning wasn&rsquo;t your thing you could sign up for the vocational track in which all you had to do was learn to cut hair or work on cars.</p>
<p>IF you can&rsquo;t get through that I think you need to be sterilized, publicly labeled a dunce, and sentenced to a life sentence hard labor so you cant&rsquo; get up to mischief. </p>

			<p>Education should be an entirely private concern.  In reality, the &#8220;drop-out rate&#8221; should be far higher. Those who like books and math will go on to higher things. The rest should go to trade schools.  If not, they will go to the streets.</p>

			<p>You missed the other really interesting fact.  That most of the dropouts are males. We have a similar problem developing at the college level where males are declining to attend in greater numbers. It appears that our educational systems are not only uninteresting but offensive to quite a few males in general.  There are some really bad social effects that are going to happen if we don&rsquo;t turn this around quickly. It has nothing to do with race or IQ&rsquo;s but more with interesting boys and men with traditional male roles that are respected by society.</p>

This is a good article to put things in perspective.</p>
<p>We import large numbers of racial minorities into the United States, and then they form an underclass layer at the bottom of society.  Then their inability to graduate from high school becomes a lifelong problem for for everyone.</p>

			<p>My son flew to Dominican Republic for baseball on summer 2008. His American team played  5 games in 7 days. He saw lots of young Dominican players played so very good, he wondered how they played so very good till his coach told him that Dominicans have only 3 hours in high school and take 3 classes : SPANISH, READ-WRITE and MATH. That all&hellip;.. FEW OF HOURS IN EDUCATION and LOTS OF HOURS TO PLAY BASEBALL AND SWIMMING&hellip;&hellip;</p>

			<p>If 1-3 non-whites drop out of public school why is this a bad thing. This should be a cause for celebration not grief and who believes these numbers anyway? <br>
Beware of those rigging these numbers because the rate may not be this high but this is just another way to funnel more billions into the system to assist them. <br>
Beware that this also came out right before Obama is elected so he can use this as ammo to waste more billions for social engineering in the schools where trillions have been wasted already with no results. </p>
<p>We can only hope these 1-3 figs are true and we think it should be 50% or better but we are certain fuzzy math prevails in DC as usual.</p>

			<p>Well, this is only logical. After all, where&rsquo;s the incentive to stay and learn?  I don&rsquo;t say that jokingly. They are told from the moment they can comprehend speach that what they need to survive they will have handed to them by the government. They learn from the reality of their crackhead mothers that if they need sustinence they only need to get whitey to pay for it. And also, many see the reality of lower paid imports getting the so-called high tech jobs. It&rsquo;s all quite sickening. Of course after witnessing the phenomena of the mulato messiah I am left still wondering, What The &#8220;Heck&#8221; happened here? </p>

			<p>Just look at WHY the drop out rate is so high???????? Can you guess???? Can it be because of the black and ILLEGAL hispanic population increase??? can it be because they could care less if they learn anything but how to sign their names on a welfare check????? YOU GOT IT, THAT IS THE REASON, LAZY NO GOOD FOR NOTHINGS, FOR GENERATIONS!! So I say, let those two factions, go to their own schools, back in mexico or africa, that would take care of dropout statistics in the USA, it will drop wayyyyyyyyyy down in an instant!!</p>

			<p>And our government tells us that these dropout-children of immigrants are going to save Social Security and Medicare, and improve the economy?  Exactly the opposite.  Each uneducatable, low-skilled immigrant into the USA and their plague of uneducatable children will drain the public coffers, resulting in even greater problems for Social Security, Medicare, etc.  Imagine the expense of caring for 20 million aged illegals, 30 years from now.  Your Social Security and Medicare payments will need to be cut to support Jose from Mexico and Demetrio from Haiti, who never paid into SS, because they mainly worked off the books or only made $8/hr.  As for stimulating the economy, we only need to look at California, which was an economic powerhouse before massive immigration, but is now bankrupt. </p>

			<p>Of course they drop out.  They realize that the government will extort money from working Americans as taxes in order to pay them to stay home, smoke marijuana, drink malt liquor, watch BETV, and reproduce.  Why in Heaven&rsquo;s name should they want to finish school and get a job?  I received a $100,000 payout for a patent back in 1994, of which the government confiscated $35,000 for precisely this sort of nonsense.  I worked 60 hour weeks in the lab, generating a patent on an average of every four weeks, and after six years of doing this, working for complete jerks, my blood pressure was tested at 175/105 at the age of 31.</p>
<p>My wife and I make so little money now that we don&rsquo;t have to pay income taxes to support these non-productive loafers.  My blood pressure was last tested - when I tried to donate blood - at 85/45 - too low to donate blood.  I try to consider that $35,000 a learning experience, which helps keep me from thinking about what I might have purchased with it.</p>

			<p>They lump all minorities together.  Wonder what the breakdown is of Blacks and Hispanics.  I&rsquo;m sure the Asian rate is negligible.</p>
<p>I wonder what the dropout rates of whites is too.  Surely it is worsening too with the degradation of societal norms.  Also, it&rsquo;s got to be uncomfortable for whites to be exposed to the &#8216;whites as evil&rsquo; narrative taught in schools these days.</p>
<p>Anybody think that this multicult lie will explode into violence within 15 years?  An outright lie cannot go on forever.</p>

<p>I read the article you posted by paleo conservative.  The author, while correctly decrying unfettered immigration from mexico, leaves out a key factor as to why blacks and hispanics, despite having money pitchforked at them, have such high drop out rates: Average IQs of 85 for blacks and 89 for hispanics.</p>
<p>No amount of money will change this fact  &mdash;  and that is exactly why (as per the article) &#8220;..The Des Moines Public School District&hellip; about 82.3% White&hellip;had a recent overall graduation rate of 84%&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>A district with a White majority cannot in anyway be compared to a district with a non-White majority, as does paleo conservative when he wonders WHY Des Moines, with less money, has a significantly lower drop out rate than LA.</p>
<p>Paleo Conservative writes: &#8220;..The problem isn&rsquo;t one of money dear readers. It never was&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously correct, except he won&rsquo;t touch the political hot potato (or is it potatoe?) of IQ differences between the races:  Low IQ, inability to plan for the future and intractable behavioral problems are the cause of high NAM drop-out rates.</p>
<p>In a sane and just world, Charles Murray would be the leading voice of educational reality instead of the no-nothing egalitarians romantics pontificating from their ivory towers about &#8216;income disparities&rsquo;, &#8216;racial prejudice&rsquo;, &#8216;poverty&rsquo; or &#8216;not enough money&rsquo; as the reasons for the high drop-out rate and large achievement gap between Whites and NAMs.</p>
<p>Or as Murry explains:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Academic achievement is best predicted by IQ&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The following is a fine article by Ian Jobling on Murray&rsquo;s educational realism:</p>

<p>It goes both ways.  The productive part of the population isn&rsquo;t growing at all while the &#8220;economically challenged&#8221; part is exploding.  The level of entitlements these people receive now will decrease as their population increases.  The rich won&rsquo;t pay extra taxes and there&rsquo;s only so much blood you can suck out of the middle class.   </p>

<p>School shouldn&rsquo;t be made &#8220;interesting&#8221; for boys.  School is school.  It is about learning.  If a student is &#8220;bored&#8221; with school, then he doesn&rsquo;t have the initiative to make it in society, and is best suited to a vocational track.</p>
<p>As a former teacher, I saw plenty of these slacker boys who would choose to not do any work, regardless of how &#8220;fun&#8221; you made the assignment.  On the other hand, I saw plenty of boys who succeeded and were tomorrow&rsquo;s obvious leaders.  There were also plenty of poorly-performing girls.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t buy into the &#8220;boys aren&rsquo;t being taught in the manner that sparks their interests&#8221; nonsense.  Were any of the intellectual greats taught in such a manner?  No.  Teaching in a &#8220;fun manner&#8221; is nothing more than a dumbing down, for doing such generally dilutes content.</p>

			<p>So how come only 2% of Vietnamese boys drop out of school if being male is what causes you to drop out. Are these Vietnamese boys not really fully male or what?</p>
<p>If it &#8220;has nothing to do with IQ&#8221;, nevertheless, I find it fascinating that the groups with very high dropout rates are not very high in IQ either. Show me a high-IQ group with a sky high dropout rate? Can&rsquo;t find one? Hmmm.</p>
<p>Black population has barely gone up at all recently. More Blacks can&rsquo;t possibly be causing this problem. The entire increase in dropout rate is due to increasing Hispanics.</p>
<p>White dropout = ~13%<br>
Black dropout = ~33%<br>
Hispanic dropout = 50%</p>
<p>Clearly it&rsquo;s not all about IQ, but for sure that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>

=============================================================</p>
<p>Who said teaching in a &#8216;fun&rsquo; manner was what was necessary?<br>
The school system is now geared to what girls like because its run mostly by low iq social-engineeresses.</p>
<p>Girls are happy to do assignments - guys, if they understand the material - want to take the exam and get it over with. Doing assignment 1 then 2 then 3 then midterm then&hellip;etc etc for simple concepts grates on their instinctual drive to understand and move on (create a world). </p>
<p>It is perfectly suited to girls instinctual drive to nourish and caress (make it more social, not competition based with a clear cut goal and ending).</p>
<p>This can be seen in college too. Honestly and bluntly - look at any college major that is NECESSARY to go to college for, for you actually learn something that is needed on the job - Hard Sciences - Math, Engineering, Natural Sciences - dominated by Men, the soft arts - Dominated by Women.</p>
<p>Women are natural followers, barring many exceptions. Men - leaders.</p>
<p>That more women blindly follow &#8220;what is expected&#8221; onwards to college and dont resent 4 years just to get a piece of paper suits their average mentality, for men - just the opposite.</p>
<p>Thats why we have the 60% women, 40% men split in Universities today.</p>
