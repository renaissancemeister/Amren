<h1>The Nuclear Option</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Wacker, Cornell (University) Daily Sun, October 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eric Shive&rsquo;s bigotry has reached a new pinnacle. In his column, republished by the uber-racist Cornell Review, he made a derogatory reference to &#8220;pasty white kids&#8221; who play Dungeons and Dragons on Friday nights. As a member of the white community, I am enraged at this stereotypical caricature, and I join the Student Assembly in full support of their resolution to rework the campus code to prevent further hate speech like this.</p>
<p>OK, so I am obviously not serious. However, Shive&rsquo;s article actually did use this caricature of pasty white kids to draw an interesting comparison between these white kids&rsquo; self-imposed isolation and that of the residents of the racially-themed program house. But in response, there has been no discussion of the merits of his argument. Instead, there have just been cries of &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Invoking racism is like invoking nuclear war. Everyone agrees that both racism and nuclear war are undesirable outcomes, making them easy to exploit. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Consider the recent guest column written by the campus liaisons for Black Students United. They basically enumerated a million different things wrong with Cornell, blaming it all on racism. However, they did not provide specific evidence on how racism itself caused any one ill.</p>
<p>They claim that their position on &#8220;diversity&#8221; is non-ideological. Yet when others fail to take up their position on program houses &mdash; a hot-button political issue on campus &mdash; they label it as yet another manifestation of racism rather than a legitimate position.</p>
<p>Clearly, then, this article, which disagrees with these liaisons, is not a manifestation of my argumentation and writing skills. It is just a manifestation of the racism and white privilege lurking deep inside my soul. So I might as well stop writing now.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps it makes sense that invoking &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; makes me skeptical. Accusing detractors of hating diversity if they do not support the protestors is like saying someone is un-Christian if they do not support Pat Robertson.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A few years ago, L.A. Times Columnist Gregory Rodriguez made the case that the problems with academic scholarship lie not with leftists and Marxists but with &#8220;craven emotional warriors in the arena of identity politics.&#8221; Rodriguez identified ethnic studies departments as one of the most likely places among many to harbor these warriors.</p>
<p>And I can easily see why. There is a tendency to put a blind faith in the value of multiculturalism, not evaluating a work in an objective, scholarly manner, but inadvertently holding it to a lower standard because it promotes multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Applying good research to the context of multiculturalism when applicable can make it better. Poor research with references to multiculturalism is still poor, even if the author is not white.</p>
<p>But inevitably, attempts to introduce oversight to correct these problems can lead to more accusations of racism. {snip}</p>
<p>And no matter what I say, people like [Columbia University Professor Madonna Constantine] think they can still be right because of white privilege. I am white, and therefore I am responsible for hundreds of years of discrimination, so I have no credibility.</p>
<p>Now I am not a student of color, so I cannot invoke racism to help my cause. And I was not born into a rich family with slave owners as ancestors, so I cannot take advantage of this &#8220;white privilege&#8221; that supposedly lies within me. In the end, I can only rely on the strength of my evidence and arguments.</p>
<p>I suggest that my opponents begin to do the same.</p>

			<p>This young man uses logic and reason&hellip;.he is doomed at that university!</p>
<p>The cries of racism will never end, even if Obama is elected.  It is a crutch used for underperformance by the black race.  They embrace sub-par performance.  Evidence blacks who have freed themselves from the &#8220;ghetto&#8221; mentality are ridiculed as being &#8220;too white&#8221; or as Uncle Toms.</p>
<p>Keep telling the truth.  Political correctness is destroying our country.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s an absolute joke to listen to blacks at universities like Cornell yelp about &#8220;racism&#8221;. Hell, the only reason most of them are at an elite university like Cornell is probably due to the color of THEIR skin. I would be willing to bet they didn&rsquo;t have to meet the same standards as some &#8220;pasty white kid&#8221; did. So, yeah there is &#8220;racism&#8221; on this campus, but it&rsquo;s racism that benefits blacks. I would be curious to know what the graduation rate of blacks are at Cornell. Of course, if you don&rsquo;t just hand them over a degree it&rsquo;s due to &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

<p> Invoking racism is all the minority identity politics crowd<br>
and Multicult Marxists have. They have no leg to stand on. So <br>
they invoke racism every time to defend their so-called ideals. And in doing so reveal the farce that their beliefs really <br>
are. The use of racism accusations against Whites for everything has gotten redundant. And is losing it&rsquo;s power more and more.</p>

			<p>Everyone agrees that both racism and nuclear war are undesirable outcomes, making them easy to exploit</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why I advocate that whites embrace racism as opposed to hiding behind the term race realism.  Both these terms have their place as whites consider the problems caused by other races but a huge part of the problem is whites have allowed liberals to manipulate them into thinking racism is something negative&hellip;.something deviant and to be ashamed about.</p>
<p>Race realism is simply being honest about the differences of the races and how racial stereotypes are based on truth.  Often, the scientific method and statistics are used to gain an OBJECTIVE observation of this.</p>
<p>RACISM, on the other hand is anger at another race and an admission that a state of conflict exists rooted in race.  The problem is that whites have been manipulated into thinking that anger is unreasonable and based in evil character of the racist.  It&rsquo;s also been defined as deviant.  The racist is deemed different and pathological from other people.  All of that is a lie.  Not a distortion but an outright lie spread for the purpose of undermining whites and gaining power over us.</p>
<p>The truth is racism is widespread.  Most whites are racist.  And most racism is rooted in race realism.  Direct, negative, experiences of the other race, are the cause.  But not isolated incidents, mind you.  It actually takes quite a bit to cause racism in the racist (at least it did for me and everyone else I know).  It is the sheer repetitiveness of the behavior and how homogenous it is.  Not only negative experiences with the other race but a lack of positive experiences with them as well.  And the experiences tend to be extreme.  At the very least, they are of what can be broadly termed assholism (or for the more correct speaking&hellip;bad behavior) but often they are frank expressions of evil.</p>
<p>What I am getting at here is racism is well justified and well earned by the race in question.  Whites need to stop being ashamed of the anger THEIR behavior is causing in them.  And we need to realize that this anger is shared by most everyone&hellip;even the liberal trying to convince you otherwise.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways of countering the manipulation of being called a racist is by embracing it.  Denying that anger, or worse, denying the cause of that anger is unhealthy.  What&rsquo;s more it&rsquo;s immoral and often cowardly.  Because, VERY often, the behavior we are talking about involves a victim&hellip;often a victim of our race, chosen specifically because they are of OUR race.  Denying racism is tantamount to remaining silent about what happened/is happening to them.  Or maybe you notice and even say something but it&rsquo;s done with cold, clinical detachment.  It&rsquo;s bad, but it&rsquo;s something that happens to other people.  Not a big deal unless it&rsquo;s your family.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem with denying racism while accepting race realism.  In an attempt to be objective, you lose the human element.  You forget that the people these things are happening to&hellip;.matter.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The truth is racism is widespread. Most whites are racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>So are most all non-whites. Call it racism or race realism. Think about it. Hispanics see themselves as a seperate group from others, blacks, whites, etc. and advance their own interests and agendas. You have blacks doing the same and asians. Break it down even further. Chinese look out for chinese interests and see themselves as seperate from Japanese interests and so on. Non-white nations are often nationlistic and allow little or no immigration. Could one imagine China allowing mass immigration of whites or blacks to the point that these two groups became sizeable minorities or the majority? No way and neither would Mexico or any other non-white nation. So when we say that whites are &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;race realists&#8221;, it really means that whites are behaving like non-whites, looking out for their own distinct group and its&rsquo; interests and that&rsquo;s a GOOD thing.</p>

			<p>Thank you, 9:25.  Well said.  Racism is no more than acknowledgement of self-evident truths.  Don&rsquo;t feel guilty, don&rsquo;t be cowed, don&rsquo;t apologise.</p>

Blacks and other members of the darker races should get something straight: it&rsquo;s these pasty-white, melanin-challenged nerds playing &#8216;dungeons and dragons&rsquo; that you ridicule who will go on to build your computers, design your jets, clean up the environment, cure your diseases and hunger, and put man on mars one day.</p>
<p>The only &#8216;white privilege&rsquo; these nerds have that you don&rsquo;t is their superior IQs.  Unfortunately, people with low IQs are too stupid to realize how stupid they are and why their lives are so miserable and frustrating.</p>

			<p>They call us names because they think name-calling will upset us.<br>
And why do they think ilke that?<br>
Because name-calling upsets them.<br>
Personally I don&rsquo;t respond to their name-calling of us simply because I don&rsquo;t need their approval. I come from a poor Family who had nothing at all to do with Slavery or any other Crime against Humanity, so the Oppressor argument is a stupid, boring, and TRANSPARENT, waste of time.<br>
The point to be aware of here is this,<br>
They are Offending people they are Dependent on!<br>
THIS is the source of the twistedness of the Age we live in today.  It is a pattern repeated again and again from Blacks to the Wolves of Wall Street (who often fund and support Politically Correct causes - witness the Housing Crisis).<br>
 <br>
In any event, concerning Blacks, their psychological, emotional, and intellectual weakness is in direct proportion to their physical strength.<br>
THAT&rsquo;S why they promote this nonsense at Institutions where one is expected to develop their Intellect, and learn some more of the basic Social skills, presumably started at home, that help us develop emotionally and psychologically as well.  The purpose being, as the Greeks said, to be able to answer the two most important questions an Individual can ask.<br>
What is Mankind? and the most important of all, <br>
Who am I?<br>
But these questions, and their answers, are what Political Correctness and Multi-Culturalism were specifically desinged to run from!<br>
How did this happen?<br>
Because the WHITE Middle Class, Right or Left, had, en masse, absolutely no use for the life of the mind and the world of ideas. They were interested in one thing - Money. The avocations of the Middle Class were Science and Business. And Science ONLY as it relates to Business, and Business ONLY as it relates to making a big pile of cash. Until THIS is addressed and remedied we&rsquo;re all just whistling in the wind.</p>

			<p>This subprime mortgage mess is a prime example of multiculturalism and diversity in action.  So is California&rsquo;s budget crisis not to mention the &#8220;utopia&#8221; of San Francisco mired in red ink. How many hits to the pocketbook does it take or will you simply blame it on racism while your living in the streets and your black charges are in subsidized welfare apartments?  </p>

			<p>An EAGLE is a (bird) but so is a sparrow. A house cat is a (feline) but so is a tiger. Without saying one is better than the other any fool can see the difference. Isn&rsquo;t it he same with (humans) aren&rsquo;t their recognizable differences between a Sudanese and a Chinese person? Of course there are and until foolish, weak, limp wristed whites start to stand up for their own race instead of raising all others above their own things will get a lot worse, not better. And their children shall pay the price of their rubber spined parents.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The truth is racism is widespread. Most whites are racist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since a person&rsquo;s race is his extended family, and it is an unquestioned virtue to love and protect your family, any attitude less than racism is a pathology.  And this applies to people of all races.  </p>

<p>Yes, and it is a matter of racial survival as well, imprinted deep within our DNA, human nature, if you will. Hostility towards other races is natural and normal as a matter of group preservation.  Human history does not tell of peaceful co-existence with &#8216;others&rsquo; but rather of tribal warfare against others, often vicious, bloody and merciless.</p>
<p>But Marxists, who have been proved to be wrong over and over, continue to believe that human nature is malleable, changeable, bendable  &mdash;  to THEIR commands, of course.  The results of Marxist, egalitarian fallacies and fantasies, the desire to go against human will, to &#8216;fool mother nature&rsquo; have been well documented: 61,911,000 murdered in The Soviet Gulag State and 35,236,000 murdered in the Communist Chinese Ant Hill.</p>
<p>How many ethnic/religious wars erupted in the Balkans after the strong-arm of the Kremlin fell apart?   </p>

<p>Multiculturalists scream at (only) us Whites that WE must be &#8216;color-blind&rsquo;, &#8216;tolerant&rsquo;, &#8216;accepting&rsquo;  &mdash;  along with demands that we open up our countries and the communities we built and hand over our treasure to those who are not only different from us but hostile toward us as well. </p>
<p>EVERY OTHER ethnic/racial group except Whites is encouraged to celebrate and glory in its heritage.</p>
<p>9:25 is right:  Racism IS the correct attitude.  And he/she is correct that racism &#8220;is anger at another race and an admission that a state of conflict exists rooted in race&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>But I would add this to his fine post:</p>
<p>The problem is that whites have been emasculated, threatened, beaten down and forced into silence and submission (with job and/or pension loss, litigation, branded as a racist, Nazi, hater) by OUR OWN GOVERNMENT and the lap dogs in the MSM.<br>
Our history and heritage are being debased, mocked, impugned and re-written by those who hate us  &mdash;  with full approval of the government no less.  </p>
<p>The problem is also that we are being inundated and out-bred by low IQd immigrants who are open to the false promises of Marxism.</p>
<p>And we have two big-government, open border idiots running for president.  Is our country not lost?</p>

			<p>these multicultural saps at universities live in an isolated world. Even with liberal domination of mainstream media, most private sector businesses don&rsquo;t have the time, interest or money to spare on diversity, multiculturalism, and foregoing profit in order to buy the affection of identity groups. The fact is that affirmative action is alive primarily in the public sector and in the nonprofit sector.  Business can&rsquo;t afford to hire slugs of any color who can&rsquo;t do the job. The whiners at Cornell had best prepare to spend their worthless lives at universities where they can extort tenure and fellowships from the wimps who sit on university boards and who occupy college presidencies and deanships.</p>

<i>&#8220;Since a person&rsquo;s race is his extended family, and it is an unquestioned virtue to love and protect your family, any attitude less than racism is a pathology.  And this applies to people of all races.&#8221; </i><br>
  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
Yes!   VERY well said!   And in a nutshell. <br>
And therefore,  the &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; of the fanatical Left is a twisted perversion, a denial,  of an otherwise perfectly natural and normal instict.  It&rsquo;s inborn.  Every primitive tribe has it.  Did they also &#8220;learn&#8221; it, as we are told we did?  </p>
<p>How cunningly the  devious Marxists, by manipulating our terminology, have twisted truth around and turned everything upside down!  As in Orwell, bad is good,  dark is light, and up is down.</p>
<p>(And, of course, annother excellent comment from Bon.)</p>

			<p>I guess some people never got the gyst of the story, &#8220;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&#8221; because they were too busy calling the author racist for calling them &#8220;boy&#8221;.  The NAACP is training their legions to overuse race as a trump card when many of them don&rsquo;t even know what a trump card is or why it&rsquo;s a mistake to overuse it.</p>
<p>Being &#8220;racist&#8221; won&rsquo;t matter any more when you start being called &#8220;racist&#8221; just because you&rsquo;re white and have standards and opinions.  This is what we get for 40 years of allowing our dumbest and dullest to play act like they are worthy citizens.</p>

The problem seems to be that (generally speaking) none of these cosseted, coddled types has had any experience with the real world in their own lives. From their idealized, ivory tower existence, and the distorted perspective it allows them, the world looks quite different than it does to the rest of us. Yet, they think they can preach to the rest of us about where we are wrong, what we OUGHT to be doing, and how we OUGHT to live!  (And this goes for the clergy too, probably even more removed from reality.)</p>
<p>Do you recall, some years ago, when during the Cultural Revolution (I believe that was the name) was going on in China, the &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; and the professors were forced to go and do a year of heavy work in the countryside?  That is probably what our own starry-eyed intellectuals need   &mdash;   a good, hard dose of REALITY - up close and personal!   Oddly enough, it was Chairman Mao&rsquo;s China that our hippies and lefties loved so much, although they would NEVER have wanted the same medicine for themselves. It was easier to love it on the other side of the planet.  </p>
<p>America, during its century of hegemony and prosperity, has developed too large a class of spoiled, unrealistic, out-of-touch  elite. This might be tolerable if these perpetual students and campus denizens didn&rsquo;t have so much influence over the government and over the lives of all the rest of us.</p>
<p>They are all theory and no substance.</p>

			<p>As a pasty-faced white racist who plays Dungeons &amp; Dragons on Friday nights (OK; my wife and I play Neverwinter Nights online on Friday nights), I would like to point out that the sum total of my &#8220;white priviledge&#8221; appears to consist of having to pay taxes so the government can repopulate my country with people who hate me.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s strange how the term racist is now the most loathesome appellation which can be applied to anybody, or perhaps I should say which can be applied to any white person.  It would appear that &#8220;persons of color&#8221; are exempt from the charge.</p>
<p>Why should this be?  After all, the definition of a racist is one who believes that there are identifiable differences between the races and even ethnic groups within the same racial classification. This is something that everybody on earth knows and believes, even if they&rsquo;re too intimidated to state it publicly.</p>
<p>Of course, even the most obtuse multi-culturalist will acknowledge certain difference, such as that all pure-blooded East Asians and black Africans have brown eyes, or perhaps even that on average East Asians are smaller than Caucasions.  Of course, in the latter case he likely would argue that this difference is due to generations of chronic malnutrition and no genetic factor.</p>
<p>What the dedicated multiculturalist will hotly deny is that there exists any difference whatever in intelligence, temperament, and psychology between races, regardless how much evidence is amassed and presented.  He devises the most absurd and convoluted arguments to deny the patently obvious and attempts to actually criminalize the discussion of the obvious.</p>
<p>Curiously, all the practitioners of multi-culturalism are either white, black, or Hispanic, the whites for a variety of perverse reasons, the blacks and Hispanics for the favored status they can extract from the enforcement of multi-cultural theory.</p>
<p>Asians rarely seem interested in either expounding or exploiting the theory, probably because they&rsquo;re racial realists.  Which is to say, they&rsquo;re racists.  They believe in their racial and cultural superiority and in maintaining their racial purity.  East Asian parents generally are not pleased to see their daughters marrying Caucasian men, not because we&rsquo;re ignorant louts but because we&rsquo;re different; we don&rsquo;t share in their traditions and values and we&rsquo;re more likely, in their view, to bring unhappiness and discord to the family.</p>
<p>Their view of black Africans is far less benign.  They view them as dull-witted and dangerous, based entirely on empirical observation and experience.  They didn&rsquo;t learn this from the white man.  They came to these conclusions on their own. They never owned African slaves and probably wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to had the opportunity been available. Interestingly, they don&rsquo;t seem easily intimidated by blacks, as was illustrated by the behavior of enraged Korean shopkeepers during the Rodney King riots.</p>
<p>Ironically, even though most whites and East Asian immigrants seem to show little interest in associating with one another, East Asians and whites may become firm allies in the struggle to preserve what&rsquo;s left of our national character.</p>

<p>Please enough of the Asian fawning.  Our national character is based on Western culture and Asians have never had anything to do with it and are part of the problem.</p>

			<p>This is sad, very sad  &mdash;  and none the less sad for being an old and common story. The (presumably) young writer of the original article has gotten a clue  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s realized he&rsquo;s been scammed and brainwashed for years  &mdash;  but cannot take the final step and lose his fear of being called the dreaded R-name.</p>
<p>This well-intentioned writer in effect is repeating the useless cliche that always makes me cringe: </p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not a racist, but&hellip;&#8221;. And I see this very idea in several posts above. That kind of &#8220;help&#8221; is something we don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the news: if  you&rsquo;re worried about being called the R-name, you didn&rsquo;t just lose the argument in advance: you forfeited, you didn&rsquo;t even show up. Game over!  &mdash;  before it even starts. Pathetic.</p>

			<p>I remember reading once about a young black computer tech working for a Dallas public school (affirmitive action hire) made a big stink about the fact that hard drives are designated &#8220;Master&#8221; and &#8220;Slave&#8221;.  Is there nothing these ingrates won&rsquo;t make race centric and whine about?  Blacks are the most racist people on earth&hellip;</p>
