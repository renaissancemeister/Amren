<h1><a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/10092008/news/politics/nuts__132771.htm">Nuts! How ACORN Got Me Into Vote Scam</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeane MacIntosh, New York Post, October 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Ohio voters, including Domino&rsquo;s pizza worker Christopher Barkley, claimed yesterday that they were hounded by the community-activist group ACORN to register to vote several times, even though they made it clear they&rsquo;d already signed up.</p>
<p>Barkley estimated he&rsquo;d registered to vote &#8220;10 to 15&#8221; times after canvassers for ACORN, whose political wing has endorsed Barack Obama, relentlessly pursued him and others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I kept getting approached by folks who asked me to register,&#8221; Barkley said. &#8220;They&rsquo;d ask me if I was registered. I&rsquo;d say yes, and they&rsquo;d ask me to do it [register] again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them were getting paid to collect names. That was their sob story, and I bought it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Barkley is one of at least three people who have been subpoenaed by the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections as part of a wider inquiry into possible voter fraud by ACORN. The group seeks to register low-income voters, who skew overwhelmingly Democratic.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell them you&rsquo;re registered as many times as you want &mdash; they do not care,&#8221; said Lateala Goins, 21, who was subpoenaed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will follow you to the buses, they will follow you home, it does not matter,&#8221; she told The Post.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A third subpoenaed voter, Freddie Johnson, 19, filled out registration cards 72 times over 18 months, officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The major risk of fraud growing out of mass canvassing involves the possibility of ineligible voters filing absentee ballots, and thus avoiding checks at polling places, said Republican National Committee chief counsel Sean Cairncross.</p>
<p>The subpoenas come as Republicans have ramped up criticism of ACORN. Officials in Nevada raided ACORN&rsquo;s Las Vegas office Tuesday, accusing the group of signing people up multiple times &mdash; in some cases under phony names, like those of Dallas Cowboys.</p>

			<p>Hardly surprising. As I posted on another thread, I had a similar experience recently at the chili cook-off in Hanover PA. The entrance to the event was swamped with Obama supporters (though I doubt they were ACORN) and one asked me to register to vote. I told her that I lived in Maryland, which Hanover is very close to, and was registered there. It was a lie: I&rsquo;m a Pennsylvanian and am registered to vote in PA, but I figured it would shut her up and get her out of my hair. </p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>Without missing a beat, she asked, &#8220;would you like to register in PA too?&#8221;</p>
<p>Blatant and undisguised attempt at obviously illegal voter fraud. These people are shameless and obsessed.</p>

			<p>Explain to me this. If you can&rsquo;t tell illegal immigrates that it is illegal for them to vote, then how are you going to tell people that it is illegal for them to register more than once?</p>
<p>&#8220;A former Orange County congressional candidate whose campaign mailed letters warning immigrants against voting was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on obstruction of justice charges.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I was in college when the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18.  All the marxist professors were so excited.  They thought the brainwashed students would vote for hard left candidates.  So there were register to  vote people all over campus and the entire neighborhood.</p>
<p>It was just a few years after the Lyndon Johnson administration.  So I always signed up, using the names Luci or Lynda Johnson, Johnson&rsquo;s daughters who were very well known at the time.  And as an address I used the home address of the President of the University which I had learned working at my campus job.</p>
<p>After a while I started signing the names Patricia and Julie Nixon, the daughters of the current president.  And none of those canvassers even noticed.</p>
<p>It was my way of rebelling against the incessant liberal propaganda.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not a crime to try to register more than once. When I registered this year, it took around 3 months before I received a post card in the mail acknowlodging I&rsquo;d been registered (instead of 2 weeks like the application said). My probable mistake was having registered at the local Human Services department. I suppose if I were black, the 3 month wait would be proof of &#8216;disenfranchisement&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t ACORN in the news recently for having lobbied in favor of greater lending for non-whites? With millions of the 700 billion dollar bailout money - said to be earmarked, back to ACORN.</p>

			<p>I monitor internet groups that traffic in stolen credit cards, the decedents of the Dark Profits, ShadowCrew and Counterfeit Library websites. There have been dozens of requests made by people looking for large batches of stolen numbers at a discount from the normal black market price, specifically because they going to be used to donate to Obama. </p>
<p>I have no way to know if anyone sold lists to the requesters or if the requesters really intended to donate using those cards, but it&rsquo;s out there. </p>
<p>If someone really wanted to donate - say - $1 million to Obama and not have it traced, they could do it with a bulk buy of 10,000 prepaid mastercards at $100 each, a random list of 10,000 names and addresses, and the certainty that no one would be able to track down more than a few before the election. </p>
<p>Anyone think Soros and company is above that? </p>

			<p>Last December, someone using the name &ldquo;Test Person,&rdquo; from &ldquo;Some Place, UT,&rdquo; made a series of internet prepaid debit card contributions, the largest being $764, to Senator Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidential campaign totaling $2,410.07. He or she registered hir or her occupation as &#8220;Fdsa Fdsa.&#8221;  The &ldquo;Fdsa Fdsa,&rdquo; occupation does not show up in a search of public records. But Fdsa are the letters in the middle row on the left side of keyboards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is unclear why someone making a political donation would want to enter a false name.</p>

			<p>Despite all the exposes of ACORN&rsquo;s illegal tactics, they are still turning in fraudulent voter registrations.</p>
<p>Friday, October 10, 2008</p>
<p><br>
ACORN Submits 2,000 to 5,000 Fake Registration Forms in Indiana?</p>
<p>ACORN Watch:</p>
<p>More than 2,000 voter registration forms filed in northern Indiana&rsquo;s Lake County by a liberal activist group this week have turned out to be bogus, election officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>The group  &mdash;  the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN  &mdash;  already faces allegations of filing fraudulent voter registrations in Nevada and faces investigations in other states.</p>
<p>And in Lake County, home to the long-depressed steel town of Gary, the bipartisan Elections Board has stopped processing a stack of about 5,000 applications delivered just before the October 6 registration deadline after the first 2,100 turned out to be phony.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the signatures looked exactly the same,&#8221; Ruthann Hoagland, a Republican on the board. &#8220;Everything on the card filled out looks exactly the same.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Our local tv media refuses to cover any of this stuff &amp; our newspaper sides with the leftys in the state who refuse, REFUSE to pass a photo ID law. </p>
<p>There has already been several indictments of acorn employees, &amp; we know the voter rolls are polluted with phony names. T</p>
<p>The state Government Accountability Board which is supposed to oversee elections has told the municipalities NOT to check the voter rolls, which is in direct violation of federal law! The law mandates they check all names signed up by acorn starting as far back as Feb 2006 &amp; the GAB told them they didn&rsquo;t have to! </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so frustrated. When leftys go so far as defy federal law in order to cheat where else can we turn? When fauxbama &amp; his merry commies take over this country, they&rsquo;ll have the courts too. It&rsquo;s truly scary. <br>

<p>There are a few possible explanations.  For one thing, somebody could just be trying to get around federal campaign finance law, which sets a limit of $2,300 per donor per campaign.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation:  Avoiding publicity.  Donations to presidential candidates are a matter of public record.  They can easily be looked up online by name, zip code, employer, etc.</p>
<p>But since &#8220;Test Person&#8221; entered flagrantly bogus information, there may have been some other motive.  A donor concerned about anonymity or federal campaign limits would probably want to use plausible false data.</p>

			<p>Nobody will be shocked that uber-liberal Newsday claims that the charges against ACORN are overblown.  I may just have to vote for McCain (whom I despise) just to cancel out one of those illegal Obama votes.</p>

			<p>In my youth, I once wasted a month working for Acorn.  The basic setup was this: They paid $4 for every person you registered to vote that was not already in the registry (or had registered with a current address if they were) - and offered a cash incentive of another $4 to the person that registered to vote. (Mailed to them   &mdash;   to prevent us from being robbed.)  Back then there was a little bit of checking, but it wasn&rsquo;t a major election year. The issue that ACORN was up in arms about was raising the minimum wage, so they wanted as many low income voters as possible to be registered and hopefully vote in the upcoming election.  </p>
<p>They told us to go down into the hood &amp; other rough areas, but my experiences were you couldn&rsquo;t get blacks to register to vote even if you paid them. Everyone that was truly interested was already registered, the rest were either felons, or apathetic, even apathetic to 30 seconds of work to make $4. Of course, registering in the city of St Louis meant a high probability of being called for jury duty, so maybe there was a point to not doing it.   You could, however, do okay going into the poor parts of the S. side and registering white voters - which is what I did after a week or so of futility in some fairly rough neighborhoods.  I then went to go work a different pair of political campaigns - putting term limits, and collecting signatures opposing the tobacco taxes &amp; did those side by side.  Those paid much better and were much easier bits of work, and I used the ACORN registration cards to register those who said they weren&rsquo;t and couldn&rsquo;t sign the other petition because of not being registered.  Made my money both ways. </p>
<p>Given the nature of the work, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if there were quite a few dishonest workers trying to register people multiple times. Not every ACORN is going to check very closely, and who knows where they really get their funding from.  The place always had a bad feeling to me in that regard, very uber liberal. </p>

			<p>&#8220;They often say the best defense is using your enemy&rsquo;s own resources against itself.&#8221; - Unknown</p>
<p>The Obama Campaign has often said &#8220;they have the biggest voter turnout that the country has ever seen.&#8221; That&rsquo;s true, but not to what they think it really is.</p>
<p>Now that all states have passed their vote registration deadlines, its been hinted that the &#8220;Operation Chaos&#8221; from last summer where thousands upon thousands of Mccain supporters signed up as &#8220;Hillary Supporters&#8221; to keep last summer&rsquo;s fight going have all along legally registered to vote, but when asked by the Campaign or Acorn, they simply said &#8221; we&rsquo;re voting for Obama&#8221;. But, with this realization of statistical error simply by taking people at their response who they are voting form this would put the Obama Campaign in a very real sense of panic.</p>
<p>This creates three major problems for the Obama Campaign and Acorn:</p>
<p>1). All the statistics showing overwhelming support for Obama, may just be Mccain supporters who simply registered but responded when asked who they will &#8220;support&#8221;.</p>
<p>2). With no way to separate who are the real Obama supporters and who are the actual mccain supporters, they can&rsquo;t risk throwing out the registrations.</p>
<p>3). Its a moot point for both to try anyway because those mccain supporters who registered, only registered legally and all of the registrations were submitted by the Campaign and Acorn. All voting ballots, By law, must be secret ballots.</p>
<p>I guess like they say &#8220;All&rsquo;s fair in Politics&#8221;</p>
