<h1>Attacking Our Black Leaders</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Phillips, NationNews, October 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WITH THE RECENT ATTACKS on several prominent black personalities in the United States, I have stopped to ask myself: &#8220;Is there a deliberate campaign to eliminate the rise of black leadership, regardless of status or fame?&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1967, J. Edgar Hoover issued a memorandum from the FBI field office that outlined five main points. Of those five, the most important to keep in mind was the statement, &#8220;prevent the rise of a messiah who could unify and electrify the militant nationalist movement .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael and Elijah Muhammad all aspire to this position/&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Forty or so years later, we see that charges have been brought against prominent black men like Wesley Snipes, R. Kelly, Snoop Dogg and Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>Not necessarily positive role models, you say. How about the allegations of infidelity brought against clean-cut examples of black leadership like Jesse Jackson and Bill Cosby?</p>
<p>Marcus Garvey was an early 20th Century advocate of leadership exemplified. On the other hand, the &#8220;establishment&#8221; of the time was successful in destroying the &#8220;Back to Africa&#8221; movement, and the Black Star Line Corporation, and deporting Garvey from the United States on false charges of tax evasion.</p>
<p>After Garvey came the Honourable Elijah Muhammad who established the Nation of Islam, an organisation that brought discipline and economic power to the communities of black people world-wide. On the other hand, his image and his life&rsquo;s work were tainted and discredited in the movie Malcolm X.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the most prominent example of black leadership being attacked for their works even more than their fame is Dr Malachi Z. York.</p>
<p>Dr York has instilled in black people the knowledge of their true culture, language, and sense of self and has written more than 400 books on black history and spirituality.</p>
<p>York has been sentenced unjustly to 135 years for child molestation that have not been substantiated by any witnesses. {snip}</p>
<p>It seems to be the new trend of the &#8220;establishment&#8221; to assassinate the characters of black leaders by depicting anybody who rises to a position of prominence, as a child molester, womaniser or thug.</p>
<p>This approach seems to be most effective because discrediting one&rsquo;s character publicly is more damaging at times than physical assassination.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know what allegations have been brought against Bill Cosby other than condemnation from blacks for his stance on taking personal responsibility. Jesse Jackson and his lack of personal responsibility by having an affair and an illegitimate child is far from &#8216;clean-cut&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Is this really a one sided attack? Does he count the character smears against Bush, Mcain, and Palin and in entertainment circles Britney Spears, Mel Gibson, and Lindsy Lohan? </p>
<p>None of these black characters are, as he said, &#8216;clean cut&rsquo;. Each one is accused or convicted of doing something wrong. Show me innocent black leaders and entertainers and maybe I&rsquo;ll take this guy seriously.<br/>

			<p>Mark Phillips is obviously insane&hellip;or maybe just black. How can any of these men be seen as honorable or &#8220;clean cut&#8221;? I do agree with his analysis however. &#8220;&hellip;discrediting one&rsquo;s character publicly is more damaging at times than physical assassination.&#8221; Just imagine if MLK, Jr. had not been assasinated. He would be just another washed up black leader like Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton. <br/>

			<p>So these black leaders are comprised of a bad actor, a gangsta rapper and whatever Michael Jackson has been surgically rearranged into?  That in itself speaks of black culture. </p>

			<p>   Knowing the mindset of black politicians, and believe me, I do know them, they should be attacked. Blacks are for blacks only. Look at the presidential race. Not one single black politician cares about the country as a whole, he/she cares only about their own people.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Black Star Line Corporation, and deporting Garvey from the United States on false charges of tax evasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t tax evasion dummie.  It was selling stock in a corporation that had no assets other than a tiny office and a few typewriters. Garvey claimed it was a shipping line.  Only it owned no ships or anything else.  First you start a company, accumulate some assets and stay in business for a few years.  Then you can go public and start selling stock.</p>
<p>It was illegal to sell stock in a corporation that had no assets.  </p>
<p>Still is, although when Obama gets in I am sure George Soros and his merry band of Hedge fund bandits will get it legalized by His Great and Glorious Exhaltedness God/Emperor for life Obama the First.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;York has been sentenced unjustly to 135 years for child molestation that have not been substantiated by any witnesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>We need a few more details about this.  Does the writer mean no other witnesses than the molested children?  Generally speaking, child molestation, rape and other sexual crimes are not committed in front of witnesses for fear the witnesses might stop the assault. No one gets raped on a bus, but they do get raped when they get off the bus and are dragged off to a secluded area.</p>
<p>It is of course racist, discriminatory and the epitome of evil to expect black men&rsquo;s sexual standards to conform to evil whitey&rsquo;s restrictive laws regarding child molestation and other so called crimes.</p>

<p>Somehow I missed this. Where are these economically powerful and disciplined black communities he is referring to? In America? In the Caribbean? In the Middle East?</p>
<p>Oh, I see.  In his mind.</p>

			<p>&#8220;WITH THE RECENT ATTACKS on several prominent black personalities in the United States, I have stopped to ask myself: &ldquo;Is there a deliberate campaign to eliminate the rise of black leadership, regardless of status or fame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one of the incidents this clown complains about involved either black crime, infidelity or something unethical, yet he&rsquo;s complaining that they&rsquo;re criticized for what they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>With the unsound reasoning he uses he&rsquo;s probably black, but what identifies him as such even further is his obvious paranoia.  I mean no group but blacks ever whine about someone criticizing them for doing something wrong, complaining that it&rsquo;s a plot to get them somehow.  If they fantasize that whites didn&rsquo;t blow up the levees to kill them off they&rsquo;re whining that whites introduced aids and drugs into their neighborhoods for the same reason.  Any publication that prints this kind of nonsense should be closed down.</p>
<p>The tripe he writes is a better example of why there&rsquo;s no black leaders than anything I can think of.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak up and erase all doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brought against them by their mistresses, one of whom was pregnant w/Rev. Jackson&rsquo;s child.</p>
<p>I see the author also condemns the anti-Elijah Muhammed film &#8220;Malcolm  X&#8221; which was directed by that white devil Spike Lee. </p>

Well black people wlecome to what white people have been faceing for 70 years. Your black leaders at least have your own media BET, TV one and forums to vent out. Your black leaders recieve mass amounts of money from cooperations like Fannie Mae, Wal-Mart and co. Your leaders have your own newspapers and at least get public attention. </p>
<p>Our white leaders face constant denial attacks on our forums. Our white leaders do not recieve millions from corupt cooperations. Its funny you hate it when your black leaders who don&rsquo;t even have the best interest of blacks in mind get attacked. But you call our leaders racist, get over your self.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Black Leadership&#8221;?  There&rsquo;s a word for that. Oxymoron. Of course, Mr. Phillips would probably think I was calling him less than intelligent and feel insulted should I use that word in front of him. Kinda like that moronic African Council&#8221;tribes&#8221;man from dallas who went off about black holes. Of course, if he was railing about black hoes I could sympathize. And what is that rag &#8220;NationNews&#8221;?  Never heard of it, and don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ve been missing anything. </p>

			<p>It isn&rsquo;t charges have been made up against them; it is they have brought charges upon themselves!  GET IT RIGHT! It is this kind of stupidity that takes away from the seriousness of the events. Mark must think that since these men are black men in a leadership role, they should be excused from having to answer to their crimes and misgivings.  That is exactly the black political play taking place before our very eyes with this fake  Obama character!  Mark Phillips is an idiot, but so are so many others&hellip;&hellip;</p>

			<p>There are no black leaders.</p>
<p>A leader is someone who can organize and mobilize a group effectively towards specific goals and succeed in attaining those goals.</p>
<p>Does a single black &#8220;leader&#8221; in history meet that definition?  Anyone?  Anyone at all?  No.</p>
<p>Instead, you have various nutjobs, hucksters, even race traitors that sell out blacks, organizing them at the behest of whites who use blacks as a tool&hellip;a weapon against other whites.</p>
<p>Look at Barack Obama, for example.  He&rsquo;s an empty suit.  A puppet. Who pulls his strings?</p>

			<p>I saw a picture of Bill Cosby lecturing blacks on some of their pathologies, and the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Jackson was sitting next to him. I swear,the look on Jacksons face was one of total shock mixed with pure hate. Really though, Jackson has nothing to worry about. A person changes not by being lectured at, but by a deep inner conviction that change is absolutely neccessary. This would exclude most human beings, in my opinion.</p>

			<p>Mark Phillips&rsquo; paranoia fails to recognize one basic thing about white people: </p>
<p>Whites don&rsquo;t think about blacks nearly as much as blacks think about whites. We have jobs, families, interests, etc. and are too busy doing something with our own lives to bother with theirs.  </p>
<p>Phillips can&rsquo;t accept that &#8220;poor impulse control&#8221; has a lot more to do with a black&rsquo;s fall from grace than any character assassination by whites.<br/>
________________________________________________</p>
<p>A wake-up call to Mark Phillips from a white person: </p>
<p>1. Paranoia is an expression of egotism. To be conspired against, someone has to be worthy of the time, effort, and expense spent by others. Don&rsquo;t mistake our desire NOT to be around blacks for plotting to harm them. </p>
<p>2. Black &#8220;leaders&#8221; are quite capable of bringing disgrace upon themselves without any help from us.</p>
<p>3. If your choice of &#8220;black role models&#8221; includes: Elijah Muhammad, R. Kelly, Snoop Dogg, Jesse Jackson, Malachi Z. York, and Michael Jackson; you already have more problems than you even know, Mr. Phillips. Being &#8220;notorious&#8221; or &#8220;a celebrity&#8221; is not the same thing as being a role model, though plenty of people get confused about that.<br/>

<p>If blacks are deemed a child molestor, womanizer or thug, Mr. Phillips, it is because they are exactly that.  What part of that does your incompetent mind fail top understand? </p>
<p>&#8220;This approach seems to be most effective because discrediting one&rsquo;s character publicly is more damaging at times than physical assassination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you mean like calling whites racists because they make legitimate claims of black criminality and unethical conduct? </p>
<p>&#8220;In these end times as in the time of Herod, maybe there is a fear on the part of the &#8220;establishment&#8221;, that the time is now for the coming of a messiah (Revelation 1:13-15).&#8221;</p>
<p>Messiah?  Is it the the kindly Reverend Wright you refer to?  Or is it the congregant who sat in his pews for 22 years, a total of five hundred times, and agreed with the anti-white racist hatred by the good reverend?</p>
<p>This article is one of the dumbest I&rsquo;ve ever read.  I&rsquo;m just wondering, though, why the PC geeks don&rsquo;t nominate it for the Pulitzer Prize, as they did on one just as poorly written by Leonard Pitts. </p>

			<p>Look at how whites are treated in African coountries.  They get their money an land and their lives stolen from them by the govt. in order to please the majority black electorate.  I will die before I have my life run by some Cynthia McKinney type fascist.  Blacks are openly hateful of white.  No white person in their right mind wants them in power.</p>

			<p>Knowing the mindset of black politicians, and believe me, I do know them, they should be attacked. Blacks are for blacks only. Look at the presidential race. Not one single black politician cares about the country as a whole, he/she cares only about their own people.</p>

<p>Correction for once and for all Blacks are not for blacks. The so-called leaders don&rsquo;t give a cahoots about their own people&hellip;I know them all to well&hellip;they only over lip service to get what they want&hellip;..nothing new under the sun.</p>

			<p>Actually, something quite opposite is taking place. A bunch of influential behind-the-scenes manipulators are trying to impose a black leader on the entire country.</p>
<p>Funny, how the &#8220;Liberal&#8221; propaganda turns the truth upside down.<br/>

			<p>Do you think J. Edgar Hoover was onto something?  No wonder, that he is today, tainted and charged with being a cross-dresser.  I remember reading too about Mr. Hoover, that when Bobby Kennedy was Attorney General, he told Mr. Hoover that he wanted more minorities hired.  Mr. Hoover replied that he would make sure that more janitors and maintenance people were hired.</p>
<p>As for person that wrote this article, he of course, fails miserably to report that many many white celebrities, politicians, etc., have not been so &#8220;clean cut&#8221; either.  The problem today is that these people are not villified or shunned, they are celebrated and promptly forgiven, especially if they are black.</p>
<p>In response to a post above _&#8221;Look at Barrack Obama, for example.  He&rsquo;s an empty suit.  A puppet.&#8221;  Who pulls his strings?  That&rsquo;s the scary part.  It&rsquo;s the part of America that has been building its forces for years, starting in the 30&rsquo;s.  When they couldn&rsquo;t gain any traction because they were being labeled &#8220;Red&#8221; or &#8220;Communist&#8221;, they simply changed tactics.  The 60&rsquo;s radical movement is the off shoot of the 30&rsquo;s, 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s when the Communists were attempting to infiltrate our government (which they did), Hollywood (which they have) and our schools (which they most certainly have). All they did was change their affiliatioin from Socialist/Communist to Democrat.  The 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s radicals got their college degrees, made lots of money and they are what has propelled Obama to where he is now.  No one else in Obama&rsquo;s shoes could have accomplished what he has in such a short period of time without the assistance and support of a powerful, wealthy machine.  Looks like they have almost accomplished what was set in motion 70 years ago.  As much as I hate the thought, it looks as if, Obama will be elected and I am truly sorry for our country.  If Obama wins, that makes America no different than any other third world trash dump.</p>

			<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t understand the First Amendment. The press can report on crimes and moral hypocrisy of all people, including black. Black spokespeople seem to want immunity for black leader from prosecution or press investigation. Clearly they would have found attractive the Soviet Union and its ignoring crimes and corruption of communist leaders.</p>
<p>However blacks under the age of 50 don&rsquo;t know what the Soviet Union was, anymore than they know what American history was.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Civil rights leader&#8221; John Lewis&rsquo; recent blabbing about McCain&rsquo;s being like George Wallace showed that even an old black leader can be as foolish and ignorant as the new spokesmen.  </p>
<p>If Obama loses(seemingly doubtful as of today) watch the &#8220;racism&#8221; cries surround us with shrieks of rage!</p>

			<p>To Gayle Sollenberger:</p>
<p>Gayle, we have the Second Amendment in this country, the one that Obama now so fervently claims to support. There are some 80-85 million gunowners and some 150-200 million guns legitimately owned here. If Obama gets in, we will bide our time, just like we did with Clnton. And then, when the time is right, we&rsquo;ll let his regime have it.</p>
<p>All without a shot being fired.</p>

			<p>WITH THE RECENT ATTACKS on several prominent black personalities in the United States, I have stopped to ask myself: &ldquo;Is there a deliberate campaign to eliminate the rise of black leadership, regardless of status or fame?&rdquo;<br/>
Forty or so years later, we see that charges have been brought against prominent black men like Wesley Snipes, R. Kelly, Snoop Dogg and Michael Jackson.<br/>
Sir, are you identifying these Black Bozos as leaders, leaders of what may I ask.<br/>
These creatures are useless fools who at best are cartoon characters.</p>
<p>No one needs to attack these slapstick malformations; just being what and who they are is enough to regard them for what they are.<br/>

			<p>Like always, this is just another case where Blacks expect, DEMAND to be issued a life-long &#8220;GET OUT OF JAIL FREE&#8221; card at birth. In other words, they expect and demand automatic immunity for anything they say or do   &mdash;   not socially or legally acceptable.</p>
<p>Case in point: Congressman Duke Cunningham, a White, was found guilty of bribery and influence peddling. Accepted his guilt and punishment. Congressman Jefforts (Lousiana), a Black predictably screamed &#8220;racism&#8221; and and ran around brandishing the &#8220;race card&#8221; at the American people.</p>
<p>Black political figures are supposed to be granted immunity for criminal or immoral behavior, White politicans are fair game&hellip; so just HOW does Mark Phillips justify this piece of trash he wrote?</p>

<p><br/>
George Soros, Panny Pritzker (135 richest person in the US, his finance manager and heiriss to the Hyatt Hotel chain), David Axelrod whose communist mother wrote for the communist magazine PM, the weather underground and black panther radicals who now run the university and public school systems and his hard left Mother and grandparents.</p>
<p>He has been a mole from birth.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s no conspiracy against black leaders, just as there is<br/>
none against successful blacks which is often charged. White<br/>
people would like nothing better than for blacks to make good<br/>
in our economy, pay their fair share of the taxes and obey the<br/>
laws of the land, but the truth is that this just isn&rsquo;t so, and<br/>
blacks in general know this and recents those whites who know<br/>
this to be true.</p>

			<p>What is the problem with this aspect of politics? Marxists of all colors and stripes,especially black ones, have perfected attacking white politicians who aren&rsquo;t as Marxists as they are by denouncing them as a  bigoted &#8221; racist&#8221;. White politicians have not represented original-Americans ( white Euro-stock Christians) since the pogrom of the 1965 Immigration and Reform Act ended our republic and replaced it with anti-original-American named &#8221; diversity &#8221; or multi-culturalism .</p>

			<p>The headline gets his point across, most won&rsquo;t read the story, the point is, more racism, even against esteemed black leaders. If you actually read the story an idiot would realize its not &#8220;attacks&#8221; but prosecutions for crimes.</p>
