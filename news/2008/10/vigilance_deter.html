<h1>Vigilance Deters Halloween Eve Arsons in Detroit</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Oct. 31, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Vigilance by fire officials and volunteers appears to have kept the number of arsons low in Detroit on the night before Halloween, which had become notorious as &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Night&rdquo; in years past.</p>
<p>Mayoral spokesman Daniel Cherrin said 47 of the 65 fires reported Thursday and early Friday were suspicious. The total reported was consistent with last year. Two people died in what is believed to be an accidental house fire, Cherrin said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With large volunteer anti-arson campaigns in recent years, and the day before Halloween renamed Angels&rsquo; Night, just 147 fires were reported on those three days last year.</p>
<p>About 35,000 volunteers had signed up with the city for this year&rsquo;s Angels&rsquo; Night. <br>

															<h2>Thousands to Douse Annual Detroit Arson Tradition</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Ben Leubsbdorf, AP, Oct. 30, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>The city that used to burn on the night before Halloween as mischief-makers torched abandoned buildings has largely doused its Devil&rsquo;s Night by mobilizing tens of thousands of citizens and law-enforcement personnel each year to patrol city neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate of course that we have to do this, but this is the hand we&rsquo;re dealt,&rdquo; said Luther Keith, executive director of ARISE Detroit!, a coalition of community groups hoping to keep Detroit safe from fires and vandalism around Halloween.</p>
<p>At its peak in 1984, 810 fires were reported in Detroit from Oct. 29 to 31, fueled by, among other things, Devil&rsquo;s Night&rsquo;s growing notoriety and the city&rsquo;s large number of abandoned buildings.</p>
<p>But the number of blazes has dropped &mdash; 147 fires were reported last year for the three days ending Oct. 31, up from the 113 reported in 2006 and 121 in 2005.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in part thanks to volunteers and law enforcement officials who patrol neighborhoods and monitor abandoned buildings starting the night of Oct. 29, part of what has been called Angels&rsquo; Night since the 1990s.</p>
<p>This year, officials worry that the national foreclosure crisis, and a spate of vacant homes left in its wake, could be tempting targets for arsonists. Detroit ranked as the 14th hardest-hit metropolitan area in the third quarter of this year by foreclosure listing service RealtyTrac Inc.</p>
<p>About 35,000 volunteers have signed up with the city for this year&rsquo;s Angels&rsquo; Night, and about 50,000 people will volunteer, said Daniel Cherrin, a spokesman for Mayor Ken Cockrel Jr. The city also imposes a youth curfew and takes other preventative measures.</p>

The lesson here is that it always takes extra time, extra effort, extra money, extra police just to keep blacks at a normal white equivalent.</p>

			<p>All those foreclosed vacant homes must surely present a tempting target despite the vigilantism. </p>

			<p>What makes people act like sub-humans? I&rsquo;ve lived a long time and seen the change in people. The more we pack into our cities and the more that come by invasion, these criminal acts will escalate. Do our brilliant leaders think we can continue to bring everyone here who wants to come and still maintain a civil society? It&rsquo;s only going to get worse when either of the two candidates are elected. Both are pro-illegal as well as wanting to increase all the visas and avenues for foreigners to come as possible. It&rsquo;s our own fault. The good ones got away early and with the help of the far left, we ended up with two who will hasten the destruction of our way of life.</p>

<p>Yes, but that is not the bad part.  The really scary part is that it never ends   &mdash;   your children, your grandchildren, and your great-great grandchildren will still be paying 200 years from now to solve the same problem, because it is insolvable.  </p>
<p>It was possible to carry Minorities when they were only 10% of the population.  But what happens when Minorities become 50% or 75% or 90% of the population?  We can find the answer to this question by examining any place on Earth that contains high numbers of Blacks   &mdash;   economic and social chaos, poverty, and brutality always result. All over the world, wherever Blacks dominate, be it in Africa, Haiti, or East St. Louis, the results are always the same.  </p>
<p>As massive immigration brings millions and millions of uneducatable Third Worlders into the USA, there will have to be greater and greater wealth-distribution from those who can to those who cannot.  Eventually this grand scheme of social and racial engineering will collapse, and then God help us all.</p>

<p>Is this volunteer campaign really the reason that arson fires are down in Detroit, or is it that after 30 years of urban decay and Devil&rsquo;s Nights, there just aren&rsquo;t as many abandoned buildings to torch anymore?  Sort of like the crack wars of the 80s/90s - they didn&rsquo;t end because law enforcement was effective, they ended because the most violent crack dealers had all killed each other off.</p>

			<p>Isnt Detroit the most amazing place? If you are in upscale Grosse Point driving down jefferson, you literally cross one street, a single intersection, and suddenly all the buildings are abandoned, falling down, broken glass everywhere, everything is defaced and in ruins. The city has made some effort to clear certain blocks and plant grass, which is almost stranger, these huge blocks of grass in the middle of the city, here and there a single house still standing, or in some cases collapsing. </p>
<p>But the strangest part is that if you are on the Grosse Point side of the street, it&rsquo;s like a normal suburb, windows dont have bars, no uptick in police presence, you see white kids playing in a yard, all very carefree. lol&hellip; sometimes a normal white couple in Carerra convertible at one of the working traffic lights on Jefferson (Detroit side), it&rsquo;s just surreal.</p>
<p>I cant figure out how these two worlds co-exist side by side. Someone will have to explain it to me one day. People who live in Detroit think it&rsquo;s normal. It&rsquo;s not normal. </p>
<p>Even in Philadelphia, where 2 blocks this way or that way makes such an enormous difference, the have&rsquo;s take obvious security precautions which you really dont see in Grosse Point.</p>

<p>Only 147 arsons?  Well, now that IS something to be very, very proud of.  Now if they keep the murders below a couple of hundred, the rapes within a thousand, and assaults, armed robberies and burglaries in the 10,000 range, they should be well on there way to edging out South Africa for next to last place in crime figures over all.</p>
<p>But you know the problems in this black run city have been so numerous and bizarre I don&rsquo;t think anybody would be surprised to pick up the newspaper Nov.1, and read the headlines saying that the ex-mayor, Kirkpatrick, and friends, were arrested for soaping windows, and ringing doorbells, then running behind the cars in the street laughing as they observe the reaction of the homowner.</p>
<p>Someday the city may elevate itself to the level of Zimbabwe.</p>

			<p>erik is so correct.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about this phenomenon before.  Drive from Grosse Pointe Park across Alter (or, Altar) road into Detroit and the differences are shocking. From peaceful normalcy to third-world decay.  It&rsquo;s a sight to behold, and graphic evidence in regarding the huge disparities between white and black thinking and values.  </p>
<p>On The Grosse Pointe side, you can walk down the streets at night in safety.  Walk one block over into Detroit, and you won&rsquo;t make it a hundred feet without being approached by feral blacks.  </p>
<p>Devil&rsquo;s night in Detroit is just a black method of urban renewal.  That the black political establishment in Detroit for the past 45 years has excused blacks from wild behaviors and blamed whites for their every failure, the citizenry of that city believes they have a green light to act out any way they want.  </p>
<p>Detroit is a prime example of the best of black governing.  No sane person wants to live there anymore, but that&rsquo;s just the fault of   &mdash;   whites.  See how this works?      </p>

			<p>I blame capitalism for these fires. Specifically the theory that we need constant growth, despite limited resources. In animal experiments, the more rats got crowded the more vicious they became and it is no different with humans. We need to forget about growth and consider the quality of life instead. We need to get back to the time when the poor did not have huge flocks of children, that was a privilege reserved for the rich. If we can ever get back to the days when starvation was the only result of idleness, productivity in this country would double overnight. The Mexicans have learned that lesson, that is why they flock here in such numbers and take any backbreaking job that they can find. If the African American do not learn that lesson and if the government keeps up with all that medicaid, food stamps, welfare and public housing, they will breed an even larger and more vicious mob and it will get to the stage where we either have to isolate them or use brute force. China&rsquo;s dramatic rise since 1980 coincides with their draconian population control policy of the same time. Some estimate that in that period some 300-500 million births have been prevented.<br>
The costs of raising and educating these children went into factories and economic expansion, the women who would have been at home pregnant or looking after their flock went into the workforce. Under Mao there was cradle to grave care and lots of children and China went from starvation to starvation. It also occasioned the rise of the &#8220;ancient Chinese medical wisdom&#8221;, simply because China did not have the resources to practice modern medicine. Traditional medicine in China is now strictly the preserve of those who cannot afford modern medical care. The answer to every single ill that befalls society, with the exception of the wealthy is unrestricted growth. It may be a boon to the 5% who own and rule this country, it is of advantage to the other 25% who still benefit, it enables 30% to live their miserable life in the slums, but for the 40% on whom falls the work of running this juggernaut it is sheer hell.</p>

			<p>Why bother? Does Detroit have big plans for its precious blight? </p>
<p>If I were a business owner in the Chocolate City of the North, I&rsquo;d take out a billion dollar insurance policy on my building and pass out buckets of gasoline to the neighborhood &#8220;youths&#8221;.  Maybe I&rsquo;d hit the jackpot and get to relocate to a city in the civilized world&hellip;</p>

			<p>Face it, anything that suggests civilization will be destroyed in areas with large amounts of blacks present.  I was amazed the first time I came to europe and saw nice things that didn&rsquo;t have to be cased in razor wire (although that is changing rapidly also due to immigration).</p>

			<p>&#8220;Only 147 fires were reported&#8221;,,,</p>
<p> And this is something to brag about? To see as &#8220;progress&#8221;? Try to imagine a similar headline from any all-White city. The mind reels at the thought. If anything arson has probably declined in Detroit simply because there isn&rsquo;t much left to burn down after 30-plus years of black rule.</p>
