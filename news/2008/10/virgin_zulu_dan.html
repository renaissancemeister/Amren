			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, October 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Young virgins have been performing the Zulu Royal Reed Dance for centuries wearing nothing but beads and short fringed skirts.</p>
<p>But now King Goodwill Zwelithini has told the girls to put on sarongs or traditional undergarments called umuntsha to cover their buttocks.</p>
<p>He said the event was &#8220;not for looking at maidens&rsquo; bottoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the King added: &#8220;There are times when maidens have to sing and dance and we end up seeing certain private body parts that we&rsquo;re not supposed to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Locals are said to be fed up of &#8220;lascivious&#8221; male tourists who &#8220;act like paparazzi&#8221; and &#8220;zoom in on bare flesh with their hi-tech cameras.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zulus say their traditional ceremony is being sullied because of the wrong sort of attention from visitors.</p>
<p>Photography at the traditional dances, performed by thousands of virgin girls in Nongoma, northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is strictly regulated.</p>
<p>All camera-men are supposed to be bona fide members of the press. But checks in recent years have shown some photographers were just ordinary tourists taking pictures without approval.</p>
<p>The tradition is carried out to pay homage to the King, who chooses his wives from among the dancers.</p>
<p>The dancers usually do not wear underwear because the routine is designed to be a proud display of their innocence.</p>
<p>Zulu girls are said to be angry at being told to cover up because they are losing the chance to show off their virginity in the customary way.</p>
<p>However the ANC Women&rsquo;s League argued other girls were deterred from performing because of the semi-nudity and now would feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>The ceremony clocks up more than 25,000 visitors per year.<br>

			<p>This reminds me of the warnings on the travel channel to viewers of &#8221; indigenous nudity&#8221; please explain to me what the heck that is suppose to mean.I guess if they went to the french riviera the nude beach&rsquo;s are no longer off limits.Oh and what I read somewhere. That one of the reason&rsquo;s the Sudanese muslim government is ethnically cleansing Darfur is because of the Indigenous nudity of the animist tribes who inhabit Darfur.  Well I have seen the indigenous nudity in Darfur. Gross&rsquo;s me out too. Oh and as far as these girls being virgins. I doubt that there are very many girls on the whole continent of Africa who are older than nine years old.</p>

			<p>There are virgins left in Africa? I thought acquitted rapist, and ANC President, Jacob Zuma said that it was the solemn responsibility of every Zulu male to ravage any female who dressed provocatively and was thus asking for sex? Are their Zulu males in Africa shirking their duties?</p>

			<p> Reminds me of the true story about a Washington-appointed bureaucrat who arrived on the U.S.-held island of Yap in the western Pacific in the mid-1950s to take up duties as the island&rsquo;s head honcho (then known as a district administrator, or &#8220;distad,&#8221; for short)</p>
<p>The prudish newcomer was appalled to find the local ladies still went about their daily business in the traditional way - bare-breasted.  Having seen enough of exposed mammaries, he devised a &#8220;cover up&#8221; plan. At government (U.S. taxpayer&rsquo;s) expense, he arranged to ship in thousands of tee shirts, had them distributed to the island women free-of-charge, and issued an executive order requiring the tee shirts be worn in public places at all times. </p>
<p>At first, the island women were happy with this example of American largesse and proudly sported their new western-style garb. Then a problem developed.  Seems nursing a baby with a tee shirt twisted about your neck and shoulders wasn&rsquo;t very comfortable. So the women came up with their own solution: Cut two big holes in the tee shirts at chest level. Voila, breast-feeding problem solved!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not recorded how the new distad reacted to these alterations, but it is known he returned to Washington many months shy of finishing his contract. &#8220;Culture shock,&#8221; perhaps?        </p>

			<p>I saw more (ahem) detailed photographs of the ceremony in which the girls were lying on the ground with their legs in the air and knees spread apart as 2-3 men were inspecting their claims to  virginity.  </p>
<p>Apparently the King gets his pick, and the &#8220;goods&#8221; have to be checked for quality, just like you would check a cow, for example.</p>
<p>The girls have a (ummm) healthy animal side and appreciate the attentions.  The king, you see, owns the country and is filthy rich.  The people make a couple hundred bucks a year, if that, and have a massive AIDS rate. </p>
<p>They all know that any girl he takes as a new wife will live like royalty   &mdash;   shopping trips to Paris, etc.</p>
<p>And, perhaps typically of Africa, they don&rsquo;t so much as complain.</p>

<p>I doubt there are that many virgins in all of Africa, much less in one country. If they don&rsquo;t decide to become sexual active themselves, African girls are usually raped way before they reach their child-bearing years (which happens to be about 10). And no wonder it is strictly regulated&hellip;I bet each girl has to have a few armed guards just to keep the natives at bay.</p>

			<p><i>Zulus say their traditional ceremony is being sullied because of the wrong sort of attention from visitors.</i></p>
<p>Odd how such an upright and modest people could create such a lasciviously exhibitionist dance to represent their culture.  Notice how the journalist writing this piece thinks it&rsquo;s perfectly ok for them to show it, but it&rsquo;s somehow morally suspect for others to watch.  This reminds me of how journalists describe the &#8220;rich African-American culture of dance&#8221; among young black girls - and when you look at them dancing it&rsquo;s nothing but simulated coitus!</p>

			<p>I have been to Africa, and studied with &#8220;witch-doctors&#8221; and doctors of voodoo. A highly educated &#8220;witch-doctor&#8221; told me that I had been &#8220;genetically blessed&#8221; with a leaning toward the psychic. This same highly-educated man made understandable much of what I had regarded as total nonsense. When he explained it to me in terms I could understand, I was in a state of shock and awe. I went on to learn remote viewing from him, and the ability to see auras.</p>
<p>I think that western man needs to have these primitive ceremonies explained to him, and then he will understand them, and be in a state of shock and awe. We should not leer at these virgin maidens, anymore than we would want strange men to leer and the nude Greek women who ran in the marathons. Each culture evolves as it will, and we should respect that. To smear these cultures with our own impure motives is not good. Actually, in my experience,  the naked human body is quite sad, and is a big letdown.</p>

Dancing nearly naked to show off their virginity? I&rsquo;d bet anything that it is only their own native men getting aroused by this ritual. Most western men probably find it as enticing as a National geograhic cover.</p>

<p>Correction. It&rsquo;s morally suspect for whites - er &#8216;male tourists&rsquo; to watch. Or those tainted by too much &#8216;whiteness&rsquo;. Actually those &#8216;watching&rsquo; this ceremony have made whites everywhere morally suspect. Then again, I kind of read this as an advertisement. I wonder if it&rsquo;s more or less a press-release by their tourism board. </p>
<p>They say there is a &#8216;double standard&rsquo;. They even taught this when I went to elementary school. Paraphrased as - &#8216;girls are pure innocent beings, and boys are rowdy sex hounds&rsquo; never mind that it always takes two to tango. This press release is the opposite of that. According to this, whites, I&rsquo;m presuming, are &#8216;lascivious male tourists who act like paparazzi&rsquo; and want to &#8216;zoom in on women&rsquo;s bottoms&rsquo;, but they still want more of them to come see.</p>

			<p>Oh, I see!  All this time I thought the young Africans in America, and the young Americans who imitate them so adoringly,  were proudly displaying their bodies like wares in a Wal-mart in a manner to prove their extraordinary ability (and availability) to have sex. </p>
<p>Thanks to African enlightenment, I now know that they are actually blessing our culture with the &#8220;customary way&#8221; of displaying their virtue and suitability for marriage by &#8220;showing off their virginity&#8221;.</p>
<p>Silly me, thinking they were &#8220;shoving off&#8221; their virginity, or having accomplished that already (what a grand feat indeed!  Some are even able to proudly claim success in recruiting an actual African [or two, or more] to do the job- what a truly extraordinary accomplishment!),  were working hard to put their virginity behind them as far as possible, as fast as possible. </p>
<p>Just goes to show what confusion (and rates of disease &amp; unplanned, unwanted, and all the more often : single mother, teenage, pregnancies) can be caused by such infusion of foreign &#8220;culture&#8221;.   What is customary for Africans in Africa is clearly not suitable for anyone in America.</p>
<p>I agree with the angry zulu girls: we should not disturb and destroy their customs, and they should not disturb and destroy ours. </p>

			<p>Is this the same traditional dance that was featured in the film &#8220;Zulu&#8221;?  The Zulus in the film were actual Zulus performing authentic rituals but subject to movie-industry editing and spin, as one would expect.</p>
<p>So the king gets his pick of girls who show what they have.  The form may be crude, but it&rsquo;s not that much different here.  If adavanced aliens were watching us, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want them to be looking in on our mating rituals either.</p>
<p>As JackHawkins said to Susanah York in the film, &#8220;at least she knows she&rsquo;s getting a brave man.&#8221;  Let&rsquo;s not throw stones.</p>

<p>Zulu girls dance naked, and then people complain because they think male tourists are focusing on their buttocks, too much. Well, what do they expect?</p>

Only an African would assume that tourists &#8220;want to zoom in on women&rsquo;s bottoms&#8221;  because that&rsquo;s what African males are interested in.  </p>
<p>Also, there was no objection to tourists coming and looking, just against photographing.  I don&rsquo;t know about the Zulus, but some African tribes expect you to pay for photographs. They&rsquo;re not giving away photos shots for free.</p>

			<p>Wearing nothing but a loincloth was customary throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa. When Kenya was still civilized, that is a British colony, there were police patrols on the outskirts of Nairobi who did not allow the loincloth covered crowd into town.<br>
Shortly after independence, the president banned woman from wearing trousers, they were a vile western import and an assault on the dignity of the African culture.</p>

			<p>Suppose the girls had been Swedish undergoing the same ritual?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you just know that all kinds of the politically correct, multi cultural, culturally relativistic, human rights, rights for children, rights for women, rights for pedophiles, rights for homosexuals, rights for cannibals, rights for animals, the World Court, the World Bank, as well as, of course, the various mandatory United Nations investigatory and regulatory agencies, would be crawling from one end of Sweden to the other, &#8220;investigating&#8221; and &#8220;reporting&#8221; these horrendous abuses?  </p>
<p>But here its perfectly alright isn&rsquo;t it, since, well, you know, it deals with a culture that racist whites are far too myopic and intolerant to ever understand. So females less than ten years of age are expected to have involuntary sex in a country ravaged by AIDS, are they? And we, we are always the ones expected to be more t-o-l-e-r-a-n-t! </p>
<p>This mind set is not only an insult to women and families (well, O.K. quasi families or groups) but I find it personally insulting to me as a man as well! And, this is a race that is on par with the whites or Asians? Sure, and it built the pyramids and devised the unified field theory too didn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>For little girls of any race to be treated in this manner is not only a damnable commentary on the entire structure of the country in which they reside.! Just spend a month in a metro jail in any city that is over fifty per cent black in this country and see for yourself if you can tell the difference between here and there!     </p>
<p>Remember how the blacks acted in New Orleans after the hurricane? If you have forgotten pull it up here. Black is black!</p>
<p>God knows, I should have picked my own damn cotton!</p>

Absolutely.  And many wore even less than loincloths!  Particularly so in Kenya. This was right up to WW2. (And in some places even after.)   The loincloths  themselves were a western missionary introduction. </p>

Africans are not known for finesse or refinement. They get straight to the point. In this case, they are just checking out the merchandise. That&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>Even in America, just look at their dances   &mdash;   all that bumping and grinding is nothing more than simulated sex.  Or listen to their songs: same thing.  Could you imagine them doing the waltz or the minuette? That wouldn&rsquo;t be African.</p>

<p>Or they could just not allow photography at all, or  only from   a member of the press and if so, only allow  photos taken on digital cameras which could be viewed and those deemed not appropriate, would be deleted. However, I&rsquo;m with the other posters. I don&rsquo;t think we should judge their customs by our societal standards. They should be left to their own customs just as we should.</p>

			<p>Let me try this again. </p>
<p>This is the sort of thing which happens in cultures where the ADULTS are sexually corrupt (they pass it on to the innocent young).</p>
<p>It is not wrong to critize a corrupt culture or civilization just because it is different from our own. The Ruskies used to call us decadent. I wasn&rsquo;t offended because I agreed. Too bad the liberals, who like the Russians so much, were immune to that just criticism.</p>
<p>I think it is more disrespectful to presume that others are not as interested in truth as we are.</p>
<p>I hate it when I&rsquo;m wrong and those around me didn&rsquo;t try to help me see that I was.</p>
<p>The Zulu adults may be offended by having to cover up the innocent girls, but this may cause some of Zulu youth to think about ideas they hadn&rsquo;t yet discovered.</p>
<p>That is how the young can learn a better way for themselves and generations to come.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s interesting here is that even the king of the Zulus is choosing his mate based on&hellip;intelligence? charming personality? wit? Nope, based on her looks and her dancing ability (and supposed virginity).</p>
<p>Whether you think it&rsquo;s a disgusting custom or not is irrelevant. Not too many American teenage boys (of any race) would mind this custom. That&rsquo;s why grown-ups are supposed to design and supervise the mating rituals - though we no longer do, to much regret and consequence. In Africa you get the sense they were designed by hormonal pubescent boys.</p>

<p>In their culture, it&rsquo;s not considered perverted for bare bottomed young girls to dance and show their virginity. It&rsquo;s considered a sign of purity. In some parts of Africa, nudity is common and is not considered sexual.  Our culture is different. We should just keep the cultures seperate.</p>

He is a figurehead to the Zulu people and has no say at all in politics. The reason he is King is by descendancy from Shaka (Chaka) who conquered the many surrounding tribes and formed the Zulu nation.<br>
The reed dance is an old custom from times when nudity was prevalent in many societies.<br>
Woman inspect the maidens to see if their hymens are intact before allowing then the right to dance and be chosen by the King as a new bride.<br>
The King was educated in England an therefore has developed some western prudity. Plus his existing wives dont like him seeing so many almost naked girls offering themselves to him and have spoken out against it.</p>
