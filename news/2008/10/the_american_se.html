				[Sarah] Palin&rsquo;s husband was a member of the AIP for seven years, and Palin herself has courted the AIP for more than a decade. {snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				The thing is, it&rsquo;s not just residents of the Last Frontier who favor breaking away from the Union. According to a Zogby poll conducted in July, more than 20% of U.S. adults &mdash; one in five, about the same number of American Colonists who supported revolt against England in 1775 &mdash; agreed that &#8220;any state or region has the right to peaceably secede from the United States and become an independent republic.&#8221; Some 18% &#8220;would support a secessionist effort in my state.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				The motivation of these quiet revolutionaries? As many as 44% of those polled agreed that &#8220;the United States&rsquo; system is broken and cannot be fixed by traditional two-party politics and elections.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Put this in stark terms: In a scientific, random sample poll of all Americans, almost half considered the current political system to be in terminal disorder. One-fifth would countenance a dissolution of the bond. This is not a hiccup of opinion. In an October 2006 poll conducted by the Opinion Research Corp. and broadcast on CNN, 71% of Americans agreed that &#8220;our system of government is broken and cannot be fixed.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				No surprise that the disquiet finds a voice in popular movements. In 2007, a small group of delegates to the second North American secessionist convention &mdash; the first was in Burlington, Vt., in 2006 &mdash; met in Chattanooga, Tenn., to discuss how to foment the collapse and destruction of the United States of America. {snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				The dominant idea among the delegates was that the U.S. experiment had failed; it had become impractical, tragically ridiculous, its leaders and institutions bought off, whored out, unaccountable and unanswerable to the needs of citizens. The United States would have to be reborn smaller &mdash; our loyalties realigned to the needs of localities &mdash; if the American dream was to survive. The convention presented, in effect, a marriage of progressives, paleo-conservatives, libertarians, Christian separatists, Southern nationalists, all united &#8220;to put an end to the American empire and reestablish freedom and democracy on the state and regional level,&#8221; as organizer Kirkpatrick Sale put it.
			</p>
			<p>
				The delegates settled on a list of principles they called the Chattanooga Declaration. &#8220;The deepest questions of human liberty and government facing our time go beyond right and left, and in fact have made the old left-right split meaningless and dead,&#8221; the declaration read. &#8220;The privileges, monopolies and powers that private corporations have won from government threaten .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. health, prosperity and liberty, and have already killed American self-government by the people.&#8221; The answer, it went on, was that the American states &#8220;ought to be free and self-governing.&#8221;

				The answer, it went on, was that the American states &ldquo;ought to be free and self-governing.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the premise which started the American Civil War. Most people think it was all about slavery; the truth is that the war was fought over states rights.When I tell people that and they contradict me; I simply ask: Then why did they wait two years to publish the Emancipation Proclamation?<br />
				Of course I&rsquo;ve studied American History; so there are many more reasons than that, but that is the question that always stops them dead in thier tracks.

				The percentage of those wishing to leave the union will grow dramatically if you-know-who gets elected. Do you think U.S. Army troops will fire on their own people ?

				I&rsquo;m not convinced that secession would solve anything. The problem is, what would be the moral justification for it? If it&rsquo;s race, expect the secessionists to be treated like pariahs as long as the majority of Americans continue to subscribe to racial illusions. If you think the embargo of South Africa for apartheid was bad, you ain&rsquo;t seen nothing yet. If enough Americans woke up that secession became a real possibility, then the problem would already be largely solved, and the nation could implement some of the very reasonable policies that Jared Taylor outlined in <i> Paved with Good Intentions.</i>

				All one has to do is look at voting trends and demographic projections to see that there is absolutely NO HOPE of our children ever living in a nation like the one we grew up in. The only way for us to create nations based on constitutional rights, free markets, and with any hope of a white governing structure is through red state secession. <br />
				I would encourage all of my fellow Southerners to go join the League of the South TODAY. All we need to do to gain independence on a state-by-state level is to put one elected official in power: the state AG. He will have the power to approve a referendum on the state ballot that can amend the state constitution to declare independence. All we need then is a majority vote which I think could be possible in states such as Alabama, Mississippi, Lousiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and possibly Kansas. And to all of those who say that an independent Southern nation will be mired in poverty and soon overrun by blacks consider this: what will happen to the South&rsquo;s black population when the new Southern government abolishes welfare and institutes strict criminal laws? Answer: the majority of the black population will leave. What will happen when a Southern government abolishes all corporate taxes? Answer: corporations from around the world will relocate to the Southern nation creating millions of jobs which can be filled by like-minded white immigrants from the former United States and South Africa. Don&rsquo;t give up hope. This is a reality that can happen in our lifetimes but we must act now.

				Secession=colonization of large tracts of US territory by Mexico,China,Pakistan,India and Iran. The borders of these nations will extend right up to whereever the White homeland is.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another option is to throw the invaders out. Democracy doesn&rsquo;t require Native Born White Americans handing over large tracts of US territory to China,Mexico,Iran,Pakistan,India and Iran.
			</p>
			<p>
				Understand the following point:secession will not prevent violent conflict in the future. People are assuming that non-white nation states will respect the borders of the White homeland. It is a very naive assumption. The non-white population in these raced based nation states will explode. This you can take to the bank. The will make a move towards the resources of the White Homeland. The garbage and pollution of the non-white areas will make its way into the White homelands.
			</p>
			<p>
				You also have to be very naive to think that there will be paradise in the White homelands. It will feel very crowded in the White homelands. Housing will not be cheap. There will be very strong pressure in the White homeland to build in state and any national parks they happen to acquire after partition.
			</p>
			<p>
				You should have no doubt about the following:the Chinese homeland within the borders of the former US,the Iranian Homeland within the borders of the US will have strong ties to Iran..Every non-white nation state within the borders of the former United States will maintain a strong connection with the homeland. They will effectively become extensions of the motherland. This already happening in Vancover as some of you know. The White homeland will in effect be surrounded by China,India,Mexico,Iran and Pakistan. OUR existence will be even less secure&hellip;more later

				Given the trend in American politics, secessionist movements seem to be one of the few ways left for Americans to regain a voice in the political process. This is especially true for race realists and conservatives. I encourage all Amreners (particularly Southern ones) to support regional parties and the secessionist cause. The Southern secessionist movement is at a disadvantage because of all the misinformation about the historical conditions which caused the first attempt for Southern independence. The grievances of secessionists both then and now were the exact same grievances the early American colonists had against Britain. America&rsquo;s government has failed us. We need legitimate, intelligent people to join the fight and compensate for all the rednecks and reenactor types who like to dress up in period costume.<br />

				The only reason that number isn&rsquo;t higher is because many people are employed by the Federal Government and most of us have paid into Social Security hoping to get something back in our old age. It seems to me if the United States would become a confederation it would solve alot of problems.

				Well I was polled, but the seccesionists sure have my support. Unfortunately, with the current level of technology and strength of the US military, civilization itself would have to collapse before America could be reborn on a smaller scale. We may not be far from that now. As Ron Paul said, the end of every empire has been preceeded by the destruction of the empire&rsquo;s money.

				I can really see the logic in this way of thinking. There is nothing left for the whites whom pay the taxes. We have an economy that is ready to collapse at any moment due to the banking practices that favor minorities. We have whites that cannot get into universities and colleges due to affirmative action policies, that in reality, are funded by white taxpayers. We are still the majority in this country, yet our children are taught to feel guilty about being white. So yes, this may be the only solution to saving our race and any semblence of the United States. It was our forefathers that brought forth this nation, yet we are the &#8220;evil&#8221; that oppresses everybody else. What other alternatives are there to be explored? I, for one, am very sick and tired of being the scapegoat for all the perceived evil being commited against minorities. They kill us and one another, and yet it is whiteys fault. We cannot get a job due to the illegals working for pennies on the dollar. Big business has one allegiance, MONEY. Unions have also turned their backs on whites. So yes, secession is becoming a very attractive alternative. At this point, I am more worried about my White kinsmen than I am about a country that has turned its back on us. I could see the U.S. sectioned off into three very different countries. The northern states including Alaska, being a white country, the southern states being a black country, and the southwest being a hispanic country governed by Mexico. Oh, and Hawaii will probably be its own country governed by Hawaiians. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m not asking for this separation, I just feel it will come to that point in order to preserve the peace amongst the races and in order to keep the white race alive.

				I&rsquo;m going to try and sum it up. The founding fathers handed us a constitution where all those sundry groups mentioned above had the freedom to exist and live together unhindered. That&rsquo;s what we have in common. The current threat from Obama is the embodiment of 40 some odd years of the Bill Ayers socialist, anti-capitalist pig, Mansonian revolution. The Ayers crowd was strategically conniving while the hippie movement was getting stoned. The truth be known the Ayers crowd hated the laid back hippies for failing to seize the day. Therefore the Ayers crowd figured the only way to win the race was slow and methodical, Hence the creation of Obama, the creation of a dysfunctional abandoned mulato with a degenerate mother. So the way I see it. This is a hostile take over of the Democratic/Representative Republic system with a deliberate attempt to usurp the authority of our forefathers. Therefore WE as the generation that handed the car keys over to you, herby revoke your privilege to use the car. Now I say&hellip;Try and touch the car kid. Try it and see what happens. You think you got what it takes kid? This is what you always wanted..A cance to take a poke at dad.

				This is the disease that the foreign-born internationalist Alexander Hamilton introduced to the new Republic &mdash; the concept of a federal government greater than the sum of its parts and able to subject its own will on them.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Constitution was clearly a compact between States, which any State is free to leave as it sees fit. If Saint Abraham Lincoln had understood this, the Civil War would have been prevented and American history would have traveled a much better course.<br />

				Wow! One out of five Americans would consider a separation from the Federal Union. I wish they had joined the Southern Nationalist Party (SNP) back in 1979 in Memphis, when the message was much the same.

				I was there and I have kept the faith for almost thirty years. Maybe worse is much better. If things get more exaggerated, more and more people will see the same light.

				I don&rsquo;t want secession. That will leave Reds and foreigners with secure bases from which to renew their assault on Whites. Within their own domains, they will suppress all opposition using every means known to the modern police state, while in our territory, the tolerant Anglo-Saxon tradition will be exploited by alien sympathizers. Nor do I wish to concede lands won and civilized by my ancestors.

				Inevitably, the argument against greater autonomy for the individual states will first center on economics. If that fails, the argument will then switch to the various &#8220;rights&#8221; of minorities, women and homosexuals and how these will be jeopardized by a retreat from central control. And if that, too, should fail, the argument will finally center on some type of grand, mystic, quasi-religious Lincolnian vision of Manifest Destiny.
			</p>
			<p>
				Naturally, should all of the above fail, out will come the knives. Nothing succeeds like brute force.

				The fact that 1 in 5 Americans, and although not specified this likely overrepresents whites who pay taxes, are seriously considering the dissolution of the current American Empire is certainly a powerful sign that we are not yet all brain dead or, what is the same thing, fully indocrtinated by the current regieme. There are several ways in which a division of the current nation may dissolve but perhaps the most likely is through a racial civil war ignited by a major economic depression. <br />
				The federal government&rsquo;s response to such a major economic depression is very easy to predict with confidence. They will do what they always do, viz. print more and more money, thereby gaining only very short terms relief while causing the complete destruction of the value of the currency through hyperinflation. Imagine Weimar Germany but with today&rsquo;s combination of a racial spoils system, unlimited third world immigration, and sever economic collapse, and what do you see? <br />
				I see a country in the midst of violent regional, inter-racial and ideological conflict with a federal government evaporating before the peoples&rsquo; eyes as its enforcement agents desert it in droves, once they realize that it is unable to pay them except with worthless dollars. In a sense it is true that &ldquo;all politics is local&rdquo;. So too, all real identity is racial, socioeconomic and cultural. When the central government ceases to exist through what will in essence be suicide, what will be left. All that will remain are groups of individuals who will unite on some basis. What will this foundation of unity and identity be? If the past is any guide, they will form groups on the basis of the elements which ultimately define them, viz. race, social class and culture. Such is the perfect recepe for &ldquo;civil war&rdquo; or, more accurately as there will remain no single central power after the demise of the current state, many very violent and protracted &ldquo;civil wars&rdquo;.<br />
				Certain groups will do relatively well and other will fare poorly. Which groups will likely fare well and which poorly? Clearly, well organized groups will outperform those that lack organization. Organization itself is largely a function of intelligence so whites should do well in that respect and also because they tend to possess skills sets that are useful, e.g. doctors, engineers, etc. White will also be quite adept at taking care of themselves by the time that these civil wars begin since they have never been the beneficiaries of systematic central governmental favoritism and dependence. Blacks, while often very physicall powerful, are not intelligent, do not possess organization or any other skills and have been dependent upon the federal government for over half a century. While they may have the advantage of not being limited in their actions by ethical concerns or by conscience, they are lacking in so many other areas that they are unlikely to do well in the absence of a nanny state which, just as the slave owners of the old South, took care of them(and which, together with their genetic limitations in IQ –mean 85 with a gaussian distribution &mdash; - prevented their development out of an eternal adolesence). What will happen to all of those white liberals? They are likely to perish from many causes. Any list would include the following: <br />
				1) because they refuse to allow themselves to see reality and, hence, are likely to pander to minority groups who will not treat them well at all,<br />
				2) because they tend to be the least likely to have experience with firearms, own weapons, know how to use them and have ample supplies of both firearms and ammuntion (or supplies for reloading),<br />
				3) because they have always relied upon the central government to support them, somewhat like blacks but at a different socioeconomic level (this would include the armies of federal employees who now populate the nation),<br />
				4) because they lack any real sense of racial/ethnic/cultural identity and thus will not form groups which have survival values.<br />
				There are no doubt many other characteristics of the typical white liberal which one could add, but this is not a bad beginning. I would be interested to know what other posters think these other characteristics to be.

				Well, what is distorted there?
			</p>
			<p>
				I would say nothing, nothing at all!
			</p>
			<p>
				If we need any proof of this, it is the current &#8220;election&#8221; we are all enduring right now that swells and oozes like some inoperable abcessed malignancy. The current economic crisis, created to force lending institutions to apply affirmative action practices to home financing is another fine example. And, need I even mention the obvious, the utterly failed and criminal approach to &#8220;immigration&#8221; that the federal &#8220;government&#8221; has so witlessly and weakly indulged in.
			</p>
			<p>
				All of this, along with the official state religion of Multiculturalism, have brought the socioeconomic and political structure of this country to the verge of collapse. Or perhaps, not the verge of collapse, but the real thing that can&rsquo;t be stopped with bailouts and cuts in interest rates?
			</p>
			<p>
				Perhaps, even more quickly then any of can fathom at the moment, some states will decide enough is enough and vote to form their own country fully independent from the dictatorial parasites in Washington DC. My guess is, that the election of Comrade BO would ultimately hasten such events, but even if it is that corrupt old fool McCain who wins in November, this could be a movement of political thought that will only grow. Grow, until it intersects with the realities of a potential nonwhite majority USA and the country separates along racially concentrated territorial boundaries.

				&gt;&gt;&gt;more than 20% of U.S. adults &mdash; one in five, about the same number of American Colonists who supported revolt against England in 1775 &mdash; agreed that &ldquo;any state or region has the right to peaceably secede from the United States and become an independent republic.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now the $64.00 question: WHY WOULD AMERICAN CITIZENS FEEL THAT WAY?
			</p>
			<p>
				Because the American citizens have no real say in their government, its policies, taxation, legislation. We don&rsquo;t even have a real choice in electing our next president. Forced to decide which of two losers would be the least likely to permanently harm our nation over the next four years!
			</p>
			<p>
				The people are right&hellip; our &#8220;democratic&#8221; system of electing our leaders is broken and cannot be fixed. Because the problem is our corrupt Congress. With FEWER HONEST senators and congressman than can be counted on the fingers of one hand&hellip; &#8220;serving&#8221; the American people! So Congress could be trusted to &#8220;fix&#8221; our broken government? That would be like taking the inmates of a maximum security prison, handing them the keys to their cells&hellip; and telling them they&rsquo;re on their honor to serve their alloted time without guards.

				&#8220;Secession&#8221;, oh it&rsquo;s a comin&rsquo;. I preach it on every website I post on like the leftwing Slate.com site. I tell them, &#8220;hey, you leftwingers don&rsquo;t like us and we don&rsquo;t like you so the obvious solution is to seperate&#8221;. The fact is the US is to big and too unwieldy with pathetic political leaders in both parties who no longer give a damn about the concerns of alot of American citizens. The system is broke and it&rsquo;s broke because of leftwing policies of catering to illegal invaders and blacks who refuse to pull their share of the load. And if you try to fix it you&rsquo;re held hostage and accused of &#8220;racism&#8221; by the likes of the ACLU and others. It has become sickening and it&rsquo;s time to downsize. Of course the leftwingers don&rsquo;t want this to happen, because then they lose the white middle class wage slaves whose money it is they are counting on to finance their multicult welfare state. So, we will either have to fight for a homeland or we have to have massive white flight to certain areas where we are the overwhelming majority and then say, &#8220;enough&#8221; we want out. We still may have to fight, but I have no doubt that once the fighting starts white people will come and join the cause because I have no doubt the silent majority of whites are not happy with the direction this country is going in and it&rsquo;s only going to get worse for us.

				&#8220;The dominant idea among the delegates was that the U.S. experiment had failed; it had become impractical, tragically ridiculous, its leaders and institutions bought off, whored out, unaccountable and unanswerable to the needs of citizens. The United States would have to be reborn smaller &mdash; our loyalties realigned to the needs of localities &mdash; if the American dream was to survive. The convention presented, in effect, a marriage of progressives, paleo-conservatives, libertarians, Christian separatists, Southern nationalists, all united &#8220;to put an end to the American empire and reestablish freedom and democracy on the state and regional level,&#8221; as organizer Kirkpatrick Sale put it.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, these are my sentiments exactly.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is this independent spirit in Sarah and her husband that makes me such a staunch supporter, and that&rsquo;s probably true of most of her other supporters as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				The US has definitely grown so large the population has no representation in government, and those in office now respond only to various voting blocs, like ethno-centric groups, if they can be said to respond to anything at all. The individual means nothing to them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Obviously this country has been damaged severely by social engineering, the worst of which we&rsquo;re seeing right now as the country melts down economically. There will be other catastrophes due also to this diversity nonsense, with the main one in the making right this minute in the military.
			</p>
			<p>
				Regardless of who wins the election, the country will continue to degenerate, so it&rsquo;s my opinion that like-minded people should unite along lines of race and politics and work towards securing their own section of the country for themselves, creating a new political entity, then seceding as a free and independent nation state.
			</p>
			<p>
				The country is going to break up anyway eventually, and every indication is that it will be a violent separation, so we should get behind a movement that advocates peaceful separation to try to head off an eruption. But I doubt that the diversity pigs would ever agree to such a proposition, so it looks like we&rsquo;re going to be in for quite a ride, and it&rsquo;s just beginning right now.

				There was an article in the most recent printed edition of AR. Its thesis was that, thanks to the internet and cheap mass communication, every place isn&rsquo;t becoming more like everywhere else, they&rsquo;re becoming more like themselves. The article stated that several decades ago, the percentage of the American population that lived in &#8220;landslide counties,&#8221; i.e. counties where one Presidential candidate beat the other by at least a 20% margin, was in the 20s of percent. Now that figure it&rsquo;s almost half.

				I know a lot of folks here have a <i>very</i> hard time wrapping their minds around the idea of &#8220;the former United States,&#8221; but the secessionists are even more right in 2008 than they were in 1861. The federal government is corrupt beyond any hope of reform, as the recent bailouts and other financial shenanigans &mdash; enacted in the face of overwhelming popular opposition &mdash; have proven beyond a doubt. I give Ron Paul an A+ for effort (and I contributed to his campaign), but he had zero chance of success &mdash; the system was rigged against him from the get-go.

				Re-read the <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/" rel="nofollow">Declaration of Independence</a> &mdash; especially the part about altering, abolishing and throwing off the government. Then compare the long list of &#8220;injuries and usurpations&#8221; committed by King George III with what our ruling elites are doing to us. If the signers and other Founding Fathers were alive today, they&rsquo;d march on DC armed to the teeth, kill every bureaucrat in sight, and then burn the place to the ground.

				How long before the inevitable breakup? I estimate we&rsquo;re now where the Soviet Union was in 1989 or 1990. So whoever wins in November will have the dubious distinction of being the last US president, just as Gorbachev was the last dictator of the USSR.

				I think the first two &#8220;casualties&#8221; will be Alaska and Hawaii because of their geographic distance from the US. The Chinese and other Asians will promise the Hawaiians the sky in exchange for concessions. Alaska&rsquo;s low population and rich oil reserves would enable the state to function quite well without the Federal Government. The Russians would offer military assistance to stave off any US invasion. The way the economy is going there won&rsquo;t be much of a military to fight them with. When we reach the point of no longer being able to prop up Puerto Rico with our tax dollars they&rsquo;ll bolt too.
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s sad. I love America, not the multiculutural garbage dump it is today but the way it used to be. This all started in the sixties and we&rsquo;ve been in decline ever since with every decade worse than the last one.

				&#8220;And to all of those who say that an independent Southern nation will be mired in poverty and soon overrun by blacks consider this: what will happen to the South&rsquo;s black population when the new Southern government abolishes welfare and institutes strict criminal laws?&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Excellent idea. I always thought modern southern seccessionists were nuts because they would be burdened with a 25 to 50 percent black population. But this would solve the problem.
			</p>
			<p>
				But you would need to abolish all affirmative action to get rid of all the government worker blacks and reduce the judiciary to the European way where the elected legislatures not judges make the laws.

				&#8220;Another option is to throw the invaders out. Democracy doesn&rsquo;t require Native Born White Americans handing over large tracts of US territory to China,Mexico,Iran,Pakistan,India and Iran.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				I agree but there&rsquo;s at least a third of Whites out there that have formed alliances with these aliens aka the Democrat Party. Both sides are roughly at parity right now but that will change as the demographics change. Democracy won&rsquo;t work here. I&rsquo;ve been hoping for some time that as the White liberal kooks shrink into a minority on the left and the nonwhite lefties into the majority that these people will see the light.

				This article was encouraging to read.
			</p>
			<p>
				There&rsquo;s so much to talk about, and yet more to do. But this is just a post at AR, so&hellip;
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing I will say, both Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s AR, and the people at VDARE, two websites I admire, respect and read daily, have given us so much valuable and insightful information to help us identify and make sense out of the problems we all face today.<br />
				But neither one, to my knowledge, has said one word about how WE could have let this happen. By &#8220;we&#8221; I mean Whites, of course.<br />
				After a while both sites kind of read like a seemingly never-ending laundry list of complaints. Sophisticated and in-depth complaints, to counter the sophisticated psychopaths that have destroyed our Country, but complaints none the less. Between the articles and posts at AR, to the articles, blog and letters at VDARE, it&rsquo;s like a long, long list of, &#8220;and then they did this; and now they&rsquo;re doing this; and then they did that, and now they&rsquo;re doing this&hellip;..&#8221; etc, etc, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the great ironies of reading both sites is that after a while, what they DON&rsquo;T talk about makes it easy to see exactly how we got into this mess. Perhaps if we began to talk about such things* we might ditch the endless Diagnosis and get to some workable solutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				*from Family, to a lack of Racial Solidarity. For example, since in the past what solidarity we had operated unconsciously, and now, when it needs to operate consciously, we are not responding, the question becomes, &#8220;Are we even capable of Racial Solidarity?&#8221; That would be an interseting topic that would give AR readers an opportunity to not just vent, but propose some solutions. <br />
				In any event, perhaps we sensed the answer to that question and were terrified, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re stuck in the Diagnonsis stage and why the constant complaining is turning us into the very kind of people we complain about. Or maybe we just weren&rsquo;t ready yet. Are we ready now?<br />

				This has got to be my favorite thread ever, here at AR. The subject matter and the insight from the regular posters is outstanding. Kinda gives one hope.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will add that I have advocated roughly the same thing as is contained in the original article. Sure it is far from an ideal answer to our problems. But what is the alternative? To eventually be a hated minority in our own country, ruled by those with a grudge against whites?
			</p>
			<p>
				I also agree with those who say this transformation, if it occurs, will be a violent one. So be it. Of course we would rather have a peaceful split, but there is no way the minorities and diversitoids are going to voluntarily give up their golden goose. But we will prevail. Just look what Katrina taught us, or more accurately confirmed, about a certain segment of the population and their reaction to a crisis. And those unwelcomed guests from south of the border? IMO, without the white man&rsquo;s manufacturing and service jobs to work, the majority of them would head home. They would not be welcome in &#8220;our&#8221; new country and the &#8220;liberal&#8221; side of the country would soon be a thirdworld cesspit and therefore couldnt employ them either. The major problem I see here, like others already pointed out, is the libs and minorities demanding to be let into our country so they could survive, once their multicultural utopia collapsed, probably in less than a year.

				Seems like I recall Mr Taylor touching on this subject before. I&rsquo;d love to hear his views in more detail on secession.

				Lorin in the first comment is correct. Slavery was only one of many topics involved during the Civil War. The war was not fought over it, but it was just an issue. Only through the dumbing down of America does that fact have to be stated. My running group is a group of well educated, professional - some retired and some still working - business men and women and the &#8220;drop out of the Union&#8221; discussion has come up many times the last five or so years. The reasons are exactly the same as listed in the article. My state has little in common with the &#8220;left coast&#8221; or the east coast. Their ethics make us all sick and we absolutely hate knowing that any of our tax dollars are spent there. We do not like them, their views, their politics, their morals, their ethics or just about anything the east and left coast have to offer. I would just as soon that anyone visiting from there have to have a visa to enter my state. The Union is no longer a union. The Union Government has been ruined by unethical, immoral people. The system is broken and can never be fixed. Obama, if elected, will be the deciding factor in the undoing of the USA. His Islamic, communist policies will be the last nail in the coffin - the last straw that breaks the horses back. Fact - just sit back and enjoy.

				I understand that the American infantry is 85% White. Does anyone know if that&rsquo;s not true? I also have read that the various special forces, Green Berets, Army Rangers, Navy Seals, Marine Recon, are overwhelmingly White. The highly technical people are obviously mostly White, so I suppose that most of the Blacks and Hispanics are in support units. The people who do the work of killing are mostly our people. Will White boys from Indiana shoot White people on behalf of Blacks and Mexicans? <br />
				As for other countries seizing Alaska and Hawaii, not likely. As the Soviet Union collapsed, nobody touched them. Their strategic nuclear forces remained formidable. Nobody wants to tangle with the U.S. military either. Our economy may be hollowed out, but we have put a lot of resources into the war machine, and it remains the most powerful in the world.

				&#8220;Dedalus&#8221; Excellent observation - and honestly, one that has actually been made here before on more than one occasion. The collective whole of the &#8220;race-realist&#8221; and/or &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; movements(and we must use that term loosely)is more a giant defacto internet think-tank than anything else. Of course the thought, the ideology, the intellectual foundation of our &#8220;cause&#8221; is critically important and shouldn&rsquo;t be diminished. But until we get to the point of action, of setting any of these ideas into motion&hellip;we are just talking and complaining aren&rsquo;t we?

				As for the idea presented by one commenter that &#8220;secession will leave Reds and Foreigners secure bases from which to renew their assault on whites&#8221;, in case you didn&rsquo;t notice they already have those bases. The bases are called &#8220;Universities&#8221;, &#8220;Public Schools&#8221;, &#8220;Tax Exempt Foundations&#8221;, &#8220;Churches&#8221;, &#8220;Newspapers&#8221;, etc. They all derive their power to harm us from the loot they get, directly or not, from the centralized power structure which is itself in the hands of our enemies.

				No matter what political, religious, social, or racial view is taken, white American&rsquo;s always prove to harness deep seated ignorance by failing to biologically transcend with the Constitution.<br />
				Back in the early 1970&rsquo;s the whole of America was basically uneducated. Whites allowed themselves to be enlighted by Communism.<br />
				Whites were divided by state, by Christian denomination, by who was whiter, by economic privilege, and mentally stagnated by the lopsided information of all the above.<br />
				Because of these pervasive divisions among whites, multinational corporations and big government were able to better exploit the whole of America using globalism and multiculturalism.<br />
				When the globalist movement began taking off in the early 1980&rsquo;s, American&rsquo;s drove their cars to work with alot of enthusiasm thinking that they were on their way to big pay days no matter how little they thought of their fellow American&rsquo;s in the process.<br />
				Today it is clear more than ever that globalism has divided white American&rsquo;s even more then whites were divided before while the fate of whites has been pushed against the wall surrounded by self created hordes of nonwhite immigration.<br />
				American&rsquo;s bypassed a chance to claim redemption by voting for a moral presidential candidate who supports the Constitution proving we are no better in principle than the illegal immigrants from Mexico who found themselves in the present situation after following similar socialist policies.<br />
				If America continues to fail to grasp basic American ideals and continues to support a two party system which is one in the same America&rsquo;s fate will ony become worse.<br />
				Hopefully American&rsquo;s will stop to ponder what it measn to be real American&rsquo;s.<br />

				Dedalus, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with you. I went to witness the Gran March in Los Angeles, a city I live about 7 miles from and it was scary. Reading about it, just can&rsquo;t get the full impact across to a concerned citizen. You&rsquo;re right. I believe almost everyone knows what the problems are, and like Mr. Taylor himself often does, we either have to actualize our knowledge by getting more involved or we are simply being ineffective in the end. Knowledge is power yes, but only if it is actualized. Knowing that water will make a plant grow is fine, but even if we have some handy, sooner or later it has to be poured on to the plant to make it grow. Of course it&rsquo;s harder when one becomes an activist. Anything involving stepping out of our comfort zones in hard, and we Americans are in general, totally addicted to comfort. The problem is, you don&rsquo;t solve problems that way and neither do you grow.

			<p>
				&ldquo;Are we even capable of Racial Solidarity?&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				1) In the presence of [ethnic] diversity, we hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it&rsquo;s not just that we don&rsquo;t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don&rsquo;t trust people who do look like us. &mdash; Harvard professor Robert D. Putnam
			</p>
			<p>
				2) In states with few blacks, the lamentable state of America&rsquo;s race relations is masked and Obama does reasonably well among white Democrats. <br />
				<a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/2008/03/obamas_problem_with_white_vote.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.americanthinker.com/2008/03/obamas_problem_with_white_vote.html</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is my try at an answer.
			</p>
			<p>
				(1) If we have too many blacks in our community then we don&rsquo;t trust people who do look like us.
			</p>
			<p>
				(2) If do not have many blacks in our community then we don&rsquo;t care about exploring racial solidarity.
			</p>
			<p>
				The solution: During Katrina we saw Whites group together. They formed groups and protected the women. The coming economic crisis (tip of the iceberg presently) may produce the same reaction.<br />

				Any attempt to rebuild a White Homeland in America must include a serious philosophical discussion of what constitutes White Civilization, and what does not. Many whites, including myself, would categorically reject any homeland that embraces the same cancerous and deadly modern ideas and philosophies that have destroyed the present union. I am surrounded on all sides by people who are white in appearance only. White is not a skin color. I will reject any homeland that inculcates liberal or humanist ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, my question is, exactly what sort of White Homeland is being envisioned here? I fear that in the stunted and malformed intellectual climate of America today, do we even have enough cultural and spiritual power to accomplish anything real?

				I would support secession 100% but it&rsquo;s not going to happen. While it took Abraham Lincoln and his generals 4 years to defeat the South, defeat they did with the simplest of weapons.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imagine today - what would happen,with the weapons in our military&rsquo;s stockpile. I&rsquo;d like to believe that our military wouldn&rsquo;t fire on it&rsquo;s own citizens but I&rsquo;m not 100% sure that if ordered to do so, they most certainly would.

				Interesting article. I think the dissolution of the republic is inevitable but for reasons not yet discussed. Due to the extreme distances involved in maintaining commerce in the U.S. we are completely dependent on oil for transportation. It is now generally accepted that global oil production has peaked and will now begin to decline at a rate of 3 to 5 percent a year. (Maximum global output was reached in 2005 at 86 million barrels per day). While the price of oil has fallen drastically in the last couple of weeks, the price decline is not a result of overabundance but of extreme demand destruction brought about by economic factors. Price-wise, this is the calm before the storm. As folks are finding out in parts of the southern states, gas lines are now, once again, a reality. This has been due to hurricane-related refinery damage, but it portends what is coming soon to the rest of the country.
			</p>
			<p>
				The upshot of all this is that the scale of commerce must be downsized. Most everything will have to be made/grown locally. The days of the 1500-mile-salad will be over. It will become impossible for a centralized government structure to function without an adequate fuel supply. Government will have no choice but to devolve to a regional or local level of operation (or even cease to exist entirely).
			</p>
			<p>
				When that point arrives, I think partition is inevitable as a survival mechanism. I also think self-segregation will occur.<br />
				Secession will be a moot point.

				Be very carefull how you interpret this poll. What would be the result if only the Native Born White population was polled?
			</p>
			<p>
				I never hear Native Born White Americans talk about secession. I suspect a majority of them wouldn&rsquo;t know what you were talking about if you spoke to them about about the concept.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, the growth in the level of opposition to immigration with each passing year is not a vote for secession.Just the opposite is true. It is an expression of fear against foreigners taking over the America. Secession is about allowing foreigners from Mexico,China,India,Iran and Pakistan colonize large tracts of American territory for the mother country.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the 1 in five number is an accurate indication of Native Born White Americans-and I have great doubts that it is-it most likely indicates that Native Born White Amerians do not understand the full consequences of secession.
			</p>
			<p>
				If I were doing the poll, here are the questions that I would ask:1)do you support Mexico,China, India, Palistan and Iran acquiring large tracts of US territory including the educational,industrial and military infrastructure that comes with this territory? Would be in favor of Chinas borders extending up to the border of Montanna and Idahao? Would you support Michigan becomming a muslim nation state? Would you suport NJ beaomming s Sihk and Hindu race based Nation State? I have a very stong suspicion that if the question about secession was phrased this way, there would be a very low level of support for secession among Native Born White Americans.

				White Nationalist are suppose to set an example af feirce resistance to the ongoing racial invasion of America by post-1965 non-whites. Instead, we seem to have a lot of people who post here raisig the white flag of defeat.Why bother to even have this web site any more?
			</p>
			<p>
				Leftist race- replacement enthusiast reading this web site are saying to themselves &#8220;Jeez, I didn&rsquo;t think it would be this easy&#8221;. Kirkpatrick Sale-who I have had quite a few conversations with-is one of those Leftist. Kirkpatrick Sale views European Americans as a blight on the continent. He strongly desires to rid North America of Euro-Americans. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, read his book on Christopher Columbus. Secession is the blueprint for doing it(go back and read my first post again).
			</p>
			<p>
				Let me state the obvious: WE are suppose to be offering unrelenting resistance to OUR racial dispossession across America. This is the example we are suppose to be setting for our fellow Native Born White Americans.
			</p>
			<p>
				I want a very large ocean-several thousand miles wide and long-between China and America.

				The answer is yes. In the 1970s, during the height of the deseg protests in Boston, white Irish Boston cops did shoot at the same white Irish deseg opponents that they agreed with about deseg, and had drinks with at bars. Cops and military are trained dogs, they&rsquo;ll do what they&rsquo;re told. Especially in these hard economic times, when other jobs (especially for whites) are as hard to find as teeth on hens.

			<p>
				All fails, the pro-minority American government will do what the Mandela regime did in South Africa in their first years &mdash; force the white senior management of the military into retirement, so as to preclude a pro-white military coup.

How about allowing each STATE to set its own standards on gay &#8220;marriage&#8221;, abortion, gun rights, euthanasia, taxes and other important matters, like the Constitution intended, instead of all these things being dictated by an all-powerful central government?<br />

				What a great country this was in the 19th and early twentieth centuries.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was the greed merchants and the power mongers, of course, whose unquenchable lust for money and power who caused us to evolve into the society we became. It was they and the mentally disturbed do-gooders who demanded unchecked immigration, which, in turn, brought us the white Christian adversaries and free enterprise haters who have been actively attempting to subvert our country now for decades. Coupling those things with problems from a large population of uneducatable blacks, prone to crime and violence, made it plain to many that we would end up imploding as we are doing right now.
			</p>
			<p>
				But in case we somehow limp through this recent debacle, the diversity pigs have other facets of society that have weakened the country to the point of implosion which haven&rsquo;t declared themselves yet, but they will. So if the present situation doesn&rsquo;t do us in the others lying in wait are bound to do the job.

				Secession of like-minded people is the answer to avoid warfare, however, does anybody think that a peaceful separation would ever be agreed to by people who are too dim-witted and deceitful to understand it was their manipulations that are <br />

			<p>
				And, of course, everybody knows what the alternative is.

				I understand that the American infantry is 85% White. Does anyone know if that&rsquo;s not true? I also have read that the various special forces, Green Berets, Army Rangers, Navy Seals, Marine Recon, are overwhelmingly White. The highly technical people are obviously mostly White,
			</p>
			<p>
				The U.S. military&rsquo;s infantry is (by personal observation and co-operation) mostly hispanic with older hispanics being more U.S. patriots than the newer ones. The elite forces are (except for the commercials) predominantly white and the technical people are mostly white too. I have very successfully promoted AR with the U.S. military I work with in the middle east fighting and all agree with the views on AR, this would of course be the white troops.

				These are the very people that brought us to the point we are today. They feel revulsion because the rest of America won&rsquo;t go along with their nutty plans and they&rsquo;ve had to import alien voters to prop up their political power. Now they live in places that are he**holes surrounded by their minority charges. Places with huge budget deficits and declining quality of life in an attempt to appease them. When the money runs out and they can&rsquo;t pamper their charges anymore they&rsquo;ll turn on them. <br />

				&#8216;Progressives&rsquo; helped push us into this situation in the first place. I don&rsquo;t doubt that many of them have changed. Look at the communists after the soviet union broke up. The very same people, with the very same attitudes, agenda, and style, all became anti-racists and &#8216;anarchists&rsquo;. I seriously don&rsquo;t doubt many &#8216;progressives&rsquo; have changed, a look at television is enough to see that, I just wonder if it is enough of them. <br />

				Charles Rangle Race baiting poverty pimp. TAX EVADER writes TAX LAWS. If I remember the Constitution set it up as the people voted for their own state goverments and Congress.

				Popular Election of Senatorial Candidates was set up by the 17th Amendement which was passed in 1913. Lots of other things happened in 1913, Income Tax, IRS and the Federal Reserve to name a few.<br />

				The question about our own troops firing on US citizens can only be answered &#8220;yes&#8221;. I am not demonizing all our troops, but recent history shows some will act as &#8220;good soldiers&#8221;. In addition, it&rsquo;s also federal agencies with guns and men who present a danger.<br />
				While Ruby Ridge was a small operation, one must remember an FBI sniper shot and killed Weaver&rsquo;s wife as she stood in the doorway holding their young child. Like taking out bin Laden?<br />
				The Branch Davidian raid was a true military operation against men, women and children. The attackers were obviously convinced of the righteousness of the action. They either hated those inside or believed their commanders and had no problem going after US citizens who had attacked no one.<br />
				As far as secession goes, it&rsquo;s not surprising the LA Times ignores the statements and goals of groups like the Nation of Islam whose publically stated goal is to have a seperate Black &#8220;country&#8221; in the Southern US by having the government give them the land.<br />
				Let&rsquo;s see. Obama is elected. His background is Marxism and Black Liberation Theology. The radical Black racists Wright and Farrakhan have praised him, recently as the The One. Reparations are demended in the form of land since for years now Blacks have been returning to the South. Who&rsquo;s willing to bet he won&rsquo;t try it?<br />

				For the foreseeable future, I don&rsquo;t believe that the great majority of Americans will accept the idea of sucession based upon racial lines and would regard this as a wacky idea of the lunatic fringe. If we end up with President Obama, A Democrat Congress and a Depression, I do think that a majority would then be far more receptive to sucession along idealogical lines &mdash; Liberal America vs. Conservative America. A racial split, although not total, would follow as a natural consequence of an idealogical split. If you ever visit any left-wing blogs, the comments furnish evidence of vicious hatred for the right-wing. The right-wing blogs feature bottomless contempt for the left, so we are already two separate countries at heart.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even a peaceful split would be frought with many problems, not the least of which would be where the dividing lines would fall &mdash; North/South or East/West or coastal perimeter vs. the heartland? Such a split would also mean massive movement of millions from one part of the country to another. More likely, I feel, would be a violent winner-take-all split with the losers essentially living under occupation from the victors, or else leaving the country altogether.

				That&rsquo;s one possibility, but then again what makes you so sure the Russians wouldn&rsquo;t just roll right into Alaska and take all that oil for themselves? This would be much more typical of Russia&rsquo;s past actions when their smaller neighbors have something they want.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;m not against secession per se, and I certainly believe in every state&rsquo;s <i>right</i> to secede, but there are a great many factors to be taken into consideration where secession is concerned.

				We are indeed, guy, but it isn&rsquo;t possible to progress further&hellip;.nor be prepared&hellip;.without the necessary rhetoric prior to active involvement.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, ideas can&rsquo;t be set in motion without a clear understanding, hashed out by debate, of the direction one wishes to take.
			</p>
			<p>
				Too, many times the precurser to action is a reaction to circumstances that forces one to act. For example, a further economic meltdown, making food and supplies scarce, could well drive 20% of aware whites into remote communities. It could well be that it is exactly those kinds of communities that will survive brutally hard times.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyway, bottom line is that these kinds of discussions are helpful and necessary.

				Will we need a Thomas Jefferson like Declaration of Secession? People will vote with their feet, kind of like the quick-thinkers who walked into the jungle and hid, before they were forced to drink the kool-aid (or shot in the back)in Jonestown. When hard times come, separation may be organic. The message in the air among Whites will be &#8220;go north&#8221;. Whites are already leaving California, and that will accelerate. It&rsquo;s no accident that Jim Jones and his black Marxist followers set up their Utopia at the equator. They were only going back to their natural home climate to die.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whites are Ice and snow people; that&rsquo;s their element. White skin is to absorb paucity of sunlight. The challenge of the ice age honed our &#8220;do or die&#8221; intelligence; survival is just part of it, using our heads is what makes us happy. We&rsquo;ll leave the sultry equator with it&rsquo;s lassitude and languor for those that like it: the dark races. The cold north to Blacks is like flea medicine to fleas on our dogs and cats: it will eventually eliminate them. That&rsquo;s why blacks dominated the Summer Olympics and Whites the Winter Olymics, people are good at what they like, and they like what they&rsquo;re good at.
			</p>
			<p>
				Insightful AR posts have identified the reasons why the barriers between Whites and the other races have been violated: the betrayal of our elitist class, the long march of the marxists through our institutions, the modern comforts that we have that we don&rsquo;t want to lose so have made us cowards, an over sensitive conscience that makes us guilt-ridden, the small world of travel and communication that makes it easy for outsiders to penetrate our lands. I could go on and on. But one piece of our modern bad luck is Weather!
			</p>
			<p>
				Weather is Destiny! What is weather but the outer skin we walk around in all the time, that we&rsquo;re used to and we like. But this is masked by artificial warmth from (1) artificial heat from technology (2)the prosperity that allows the average person to afford it (3) fossil fuels in the earth that provide it. Will all three of these factors be available tomorrow? I said weather is Destiny, I could just as easily say skin is destiny. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not too much to say they&rsquo;re really one and the same thing.

				Excellent post, Schoolteacher.
			</p>
			<p>
				After Vietnam military brass and politicians mandated that blacks be inserted into non-combat roles and leadership positions anyway possible even if they weren&rsquo;t the qualified personnel that were desired. The policy change was the result of much complaining by black leadership that blacks were the cannon fodder for our wars, so to speak. Like most all their complaints, it was a lie, of course, because contrary to black claims more whites were killed in Vietnam than blacks. But as is usual PC policy the squeaky wheels were oiled.
			</p>
			<p>
				I don&rsquo;t have any references to quote which will reveal the percentage of whites in our combat forces, but I think it can be determined with a degree of accuracy that your figure of 85% is probably accurate, or pretty close to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;I also have read that the various special forces, Green Berets, Army Rangers, Navy Seals, Marine Recon, are overwhelmingly White.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Overwhelmingly white&#8221; is accurate, at least from my experience, with some special forces, like the Seals having no blacks that I&rsquo;m aware of. There were some competent Hispanics in Ranger units, some in leadership roles, (Long Range Recconnaisance Patrols, ie, LRRP, LRP) and an even fewer number of blacks who acted as low level team members.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;The highly technical people are obviously mostly White, so I suppose that most of the Blacks and Hispanics are in support units. The people who do the work of killing are mostly our people. Will White boys from Indiana shoot White people on behalf of Blacks and Mexicans?:

				Tome Chittum, in his book, Civil War II, states that the police and military break along lines of race and ethnicity in any multicultural clashes the world has had to date. (The book can be popped up and printed on a couple of internet sites or read online. (Google CWII, Tom Chittum)
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;As for other countries seizing Alaska and Hawaii, not likely. As the Soviet Union collapsed, nobody touched them. Their strategic nuclear forces remained formidable. Nobody wants to tangle with the U.S. military either. Our economy may be hollowed out, but we have put a lot of resources into the war machine, and it remains the most powerful in the world.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				I agree 100%. No matter how divided we may become or whether armed clashes occur, this country still has the greatest number of, and the most sophisticated, nuclear armaments in the world, and it is HIGHLY doubtful that the white fingers that are trained to push those buttons will place their control in any other hands in the event of inner turmoil.<br />

			<p>
				The modern has exploited the concept of nation. He has twisted its meaning, its presence, and its very articulation in form. To the modern, the nation means mass. He loves the conglomerate, the literal and stupendous volume of humanity that is controlled in its daily manifestations of his so-called democracy. This &#8216;ideal&rsquo; of mass over substance leaves no nobility, nor aesthetic; it allows no one group to arise with a higher idea - this would lead to the betrayal of his betrayal - that of equality. OH! of that great leveling!! It is this however, the great leveling, that nationalism [the race-idea] will never accept nor tolerate.
			</p>
			<p>
				The cries of the nationalist are rarely ever heard. When these cries are heard however, it is too late. The cries are produced from trauma to the very race-soul; it is a profound blow to its very psyche. It seeks relief. It seeks survival. Nationalism is a product of organism; it cannot be disorganized - because there is no organization. It remains, as always, organic. To the modern, it is like a flood, washing everything away that he has created from the destruction that preceded it. There is only one &#8216;ship-of-state&rsquo; afloat: it is survival, it is nationhood, and it is destiny. It is the imperative of all ages; it is the eternal succession of young and old. [un-quote]

				I don&rsquo;t know if many of you are aware or not, but there is a large group of black people with the same idea in mind. They believe they will take over the South. I have to say, they are well on their way. They can easily out number us and out vote us. We as whites do not stand together as a group. Even my little home town of Fayette Alabama is now almost completely run by strong black gangs. It&rsquo;s a town of less than 4000 people
			</p>
			<p>
				Hey, any of you ever heard of Uniontown or Selma Alabama? Try to visit one of these places at night and get out of your car.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am sad to say the South doesn&rsquo;t stand a hope of separating. Maybe one could have hope in a place like Montana. When I lived there it was almost totally white. Unfortunately the whites were very liberal never having been exposed to blacks who lived in mass.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no way to beat the modern military at their game. Trust me on this one. I served 20 years. It will have to crumble from within. I firmly believe obama is the one who will bring about the end of America.

				Just look at American history for your answer. Look at Kent State in 1970. Or how about the &#8216;Bonus Army&rsquo; in 1932. They were WW1 veterans and their families trying to obtain money promised to them by Congress. A peaceful and unarmed group of protesters, they were attacked by the U.S. army - including battle tanks commanded by Patton - on the ORDERS of the U.S. government. The commanding officer? Douglas MacArthur. The men and women of the U.S. armed forces are the most propagandized zombies in this country. They will do as they are told. Yes, they will shoot.

				Secessionist are basically traitors who are willing to hand over large tracts of Native Born White American territory- which comes with trillions of dollars of industrial,educational and lethal military infrastrucure-to Mexico,China,India, Iran and Pakistan.

				White Nationalist are supposed to encourage their fellow Native born White Americans to repel the invasion not give huge tracts of their homeland to their enemies. If there is a will,there is a way. It can be done&hellip;.as soon as Native Born White Americans stop internalizing their own oppression. WE did during WW2.

				For all of you folks that are weary of secession, take heart. I&rsquo;m from The Republic of Dixie&hellip;S. Carolina. I&rsquo;ve talk to some cadets from the Citidal. Most of them say, they started the first one, why not the second. I don&rsquo;t beleive soldiers of Southern decent will bear arms against their kin. It&rsquo;s true we are a warlike people as our ancestors proved. But we have allegiances that others don&rsquo;t. We are born and bred with a stubborn and fierce independant streak. Secession is in our blood. Jefferson, Madison, Washington, Calhoun, Henry, Davis, Lee and Jackson are but a few who felt it necessary seperate or fight if need be. I can only hope to see to it one day, that my beloved South Carolina is free. And to all others who long for freedom from federal occupation, faint not in your struggle, remember far better than we have fallen for a just and right cause. When the battle starts, we must hoist the black flag and offer no quarter to those who wish to destroy us. This time the uS will have to exterminate each and every one of us. Sherman did his best and stated he wished it so. But he failed. Only by the grace of God our bloodlines survive. As we enter these harsh times may we embrace each other as we would our own brothers. For we are all we have. DeoVindice&hellip;

				I am firmly convinced that if intergalactic travel were possible and white people left the planet by the millions; within 50 years blacks and other minorities would demand the right to follow and take all the fruits of the white labor.<br />

				&#8220;Popular Election of Senatorial Candidates was set up by the 17th Amendement which was passed in 1913. Lots of other things happened in 1913, Income Tax, IRS and the Federal Reserve to name a few.<br />

				rekless01 - I never had an interest in history until late in life, but what you wrote is so true. I believe the NAACP (I think it was called something else at the time) also got its start in the early part of the 20th century. Something was definitely going on in those years. I guess the question is who was behind all this? It didn&rsquo;t happen by accident. I guess I need to get back to my history books.
			</p>
			<p>
				By the way, for all those who think the income tax was to pay for WWI (as I heard a caller say on C-Span a few years ago), that is not true. The war didn&rsquo;t start until 1914 and I believe we didn&rsquo;t get involved until 1917. There were strange things going on here between 1910 and 1920. That&rsquo;s when we started to lose our country. Lately, it&rsquo;s been really snowballing.

				Why would the US government possibly allow a secession? With modern weaponry, any rebellion could be crushed absolutely, and if somehow it wasn&rsquo;t, there are always nuclear weapons to fall back on. Sure, the US can&rsquo;t pacify Iraq, but that&rsquo;s more a failure of will than anything else; against white nationalist secessionists committing atrocities on US soil, will would not be in short supply. The government might let black or hispanic rebels go, maybe, but never in a million years would it let whites split. Who would pay the taxes?

				<br />
				They will, if those who control propaganda and disperse it can convince them that those evil, racist whites don&rsquo;t deserve to live, that they are in league with sinister forces and must be stopped at ANY cost. Didn&rsquo;t we go through all that same thing in other wars where we&rsquo;ve been sicced on fellow whites whom we were told were were the essence of evil and who had to be destroyed? Didn&rsquo;t those same &#8220;white boys from Indiana&#8221; believe them and do as they were told? This wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The outcome is impossible to predict, of course; but as I see it, it all hinges on who controls the propaganda, the greatest weapon of all, more powerful than the atom bomb. This was true of every war we fought in the past century. All of these posts, talking about &#8220;lock and load&#8221; and stocking up on amo, have completely ignored that factor. Without favorable propaganda, the whole world will be against you. It will be declared open season on you. <br />

				What a great country this was in the 19th and early twentieth centuries. It was the greed merchants and the power mongers whose lust for money and power caused us to evolve into the society we have become. Secession of like-minded people is the answer to avoid warfare. <br />
				However, does anybody think that a peaceful separation would ever be agreed to by people who are too dim-witted and deceitful to understand it was their manipulations that are causing our ruin?<br />

				The movement for State succession has already begun. If you doubt this, take a look at the actions of many state legislatures especially in the NorthWest who have passed resolutions rejecting (&#8220;nullifying&#8221;? &mdash; a concept with a long history in this country) the federal government&rsquo;s attempt to force the &#8220;Real ID Act&#8221; down their throats. Many have simply said &#8220;NO&#8221; to the DHS and congress. Great movements often have small beginnings. Hopefully, this assertion of State&rsquo;s Rights will flower into such a great movement. If and when it does, I would place my bests on the States.<br />
				Such a movement would constitute a 3rd War of American Independence (the first was the Revolutionary War, the second the so-called War between the States&#8221;, and this will be the third.

				I understand that the American infantry is 85% White. Does anyone know if that&rsquo;s not true? I also have read that the various special forces, Green Berets, Army Rangers, Navy Seals, Marine Recon, are overwhelmingly White.
			</p>
			<p>
				Schoolteacher.
			</p>
			<p>
				___________________________________________________________________
			</p>
			<p>
				True
			</p>
			<p>
				Although my information is dated by approximately forty years I, at one time, trained both, under and with, various so called elite units. I have gone through the Special Forces course, the Ranger course, and The SEAL Course and was sent to Vietnam for a specific purpose. I was in a high traffic area for twenty months. The reason that the units are basically white is because of what someone has to go through in order to become a member!
			</p>
			<p>
				All of the courses are physically and psychologically demanding. <br />
				Consequently, most of the graduates tend to be somewhat short and light as well. Short, light, people can run and swim faster, recover from injuries faster [yes most get hurt while going through the training] and require less, food, water, and sleep! At 6&rsquo;3&#8221;, I was always one of the tallest and heaviest to be graduated at one hundred sixty five pounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is one thing to be tough and aggressive naturally but try it on two hours sleep a night, night after night, without food, little water, and, while constantly moving.
			</p>
			<p>
				My Initial SEAL class had fifteen blacks the first week, five the second, none the third (one of these blacks had run the three mile run in boots, in sand, in around sixteen minutes - that was fast - my time was around twenty one minutes - that was slow - obviously, I was able to stick around long enough to get faster - a lot faster - he quit the following day)! Plus, I had swum competitively in school, that proved to be important, I had the fifth best time in the class in the ocean swim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most blacks do not swim very well and more importantly are claustrophobic. You think its hard to be claustrophobic in an open ocean scuba dive? Wait till you are seventy feet down and your air lines are cut! The fifth week was the so called &#8220;Hell Week&#8221; which involved nearly five days of constant training on less than FOUR HOURS SLEEP TOTAL! I don&rsquo;t remember very much of that week.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ranger school is a leadership course. It involves heights, constant movement, little sleep, and often, no food. During my time we were expected to pass three out of five patrols in order to &#8220;tab out&#8221;. The confidence course was the first time that I had ever been up high, R-E-A-L high! The first two patrols that I was in charge of I passed without a problem. Then, the next three involved trying to lead totally exhausted, sleep deprived men, [my men kept falling asleep while walking &mdash; yes, it can be done, I did it myself]. I was able to finally pass my last patrol.
			</p>
			<p>
				Special Forces. Without a doubt one has to be physically fit but one also has to be academically inclined as well. The purpose of the Special Forces team is to train others to soldier. Everyone on a twelve man team is crossed trained, whether formally or informally, into every other man&rsquo;s specialty. I found out quickly that my calling in life was not to be a surgeon [my goat did not fair well under my care]!The land navigation course was a real bear. In Nam I even learned to fly a helicopter, just in case.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since I was in the Army I can not speak on Marine Recon units other than I cross trained with them on regular occasions. I soon found that there is a great deal of difference between a regular Marine unit and these Recon guys.
			</p>
			<p>
				In short, I never saw a black seal. Probably five to ten percent of the Ranger and Recon units were either black or Hispanic. General Colin Powell wore the tab; since he never had a major command, or was a ring knocker, it was somewhat unusual for him to get the whole ball of wax [but then we all know how that happened don&rsquo;t we?]. Maybe one to two percent of the Special Forces units were semi black or brown.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first break came in the so called Airborne (paratrooper) training which was a fun course since I could sleep at night and eat during the day [a sizable percentage of the &#8220;black hats&#8221; (instructors) were also black]. All the &#8220;elite&#8221; units had to be &#8220;jump&#8221; qualified; and, while the paratrooper course had a substantial number of blacks and browns, most were white. Now females can attend the course as well, since the parachutes have been made easier to handle. Formally, the so called T-10 chute required some arm strength to pull yourself up by the risers for your landing (hence I think that the minimum requirement was six chin ups). The chute was then changed to a Dash One -1 which was made much easier to handle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in jump school, everyone was expected to run five miles in forty minutes in boots. Ranger School dropped the time to 7:30 with a weapon and ruck sack added. SEAL school dropped the time to around 6:00 minute per mile, in boots, in deep, dry sand. Of course all of this has probably changed a great deal since my time, since my physically fit twenty something has also apparently somewhat changed as well, without my consent, into a not so fit sixty something.
			</p>
			<p>
				The point is this. One can always find a black or Hispanic somewhere, that is in some place, that is atypical for either him or her to be. But, that only proves the general rule. It has been my experience that while blacks tend to be physically faster initially, they are not nearly as psychologically tough, and they tend not to be able to grasp complex concepts as fast or to be otherwise good team players in general [ i.e. they tend to be whiners].

				&#8220;The cold north to Blacks is like flea medicine to fleas on our dogs and cats: it will eventually eliminate them.&#8221;

				This is true. Blacks are at a great disadvantage in the northern latitudes because they have a hard time getting vitamin D. Vitamin D is very important in warding off cancer. Whites too are at a disadvantage in the southern latitudes where they didn&rsquo;t evolve. They get skin cancer and age early.

				On the W4 form there is a box you acknowledge that your Tax Liability last year was $0 and you expect your tax liability for 2008 to be $0. Check and end withholding.

				If enough taxpayers do this a major stream of revenue will be shutdown.<br />
				<br />
				I do not know what master the goverment is serving but it is NOT the people. If we don&rsquo;t do something very, very drastic and very soon we will wake up slaves in &#8220;The Land of the Free&#8221;.

				I have been re-reading Roman history lately. Always fascinating! The depths of human viciousness, greed, boundless ambition, and evil are unbelievable when great power is at stake. And some of the parallels that I find to our Imperial America today are astounding.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the Empire, grown soft and corrupt from immense wealth and power (and its smug feeling of unassailable security), entered its decadent phase, there were occasional periods between successive emperors when nothing but sheer anarchy ruled. The aristocrats and all who could, fled the city; and there was chaos, terror, blood flowing in the streets. Various factions of the army and the populace battled for control. During such an interregnum when no one was in charge, anything was possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				As I see it, only during such a time of <b><i> complete governmental collapse, </i></b> in the absence of any authority, could anyone succeed at seceding. And probably not without having a good part of the military lined up on your side. As soon as the central authority is restored, it will demand that you return what you have taken. You had better be prepared to hang on to it.

				The Northwest and Pac-Northwest states are our best best for several reasons&hellip;.First: This region is very Alpine and similar to the Alps and Highlands which our European ancestors and present genetics are made for. Whites are a not a desert or tropical people. Second: This region is already overwhelmingly White/Caucasian to begin with. Third: The northern Rockies&rsquo; landscape is perfect for guerilla warfare and forts that are extremely hard for the aggressors to invade with much confidence.

				A nation that gives minorities special and more rights than the majority. A government who completely ignores us for special interests. A media that is feverishly anti-white. Incredible taxes paid to house criminals and take care of career welfare bums. A government that practically makes it illegal to believe in God yet celebrates transsexualism.

				Hawaii, and Puerto Rico are essentially colonies of the United States, and are entitled to their independence anytime they wish.But Alaska, and the lower 48 are as American as apple pie.<br />
				The biggest threat to any secessionist movement won&rsquo;t come from the military (who are charged with external policing), but from the federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, who would attack such a movement before it even got off the ground.<br />
				Yes, the country is going to hell on a sled; but talk of secession is a waste of time.What we need to do instead, is establish committees of correspondence in each state, and from these, draw delegates for a new Continental Congress.One determined to uphold the Bill of Rights, do away with the electoral college, and put the power in the hands of the common people.

				You raise good points. I&rsquo;m generally opposed to the centralization of power.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secessionists might secede, however, overtime, the problems they despise will resurface in time. At least that&rsquo;s how history seems to tell the tale.

				&#8220;Why would the US government possibly allow a secession? With modern weaponry, any rebellion could be crushed absolutely, and if somehow it wasn&rsquo;t, there are always nuclear weapons to fall back on.&#8221; Posted by at 7:41 AM on October 12

				History reveals quite clearly that it&rsquo;s usually anti-government groups that come out on top of most uheavals. Look at China, Cuba, Nicaragua, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, the Basques in Spain, etc., to name but a few recent ones. And don&rsquo;t forget our own revolution where just twenty-percent of the people were active against an overwhelming army and navy from King George, armed to the teeth with the best cannons, rifles and war ships, plus an unending amount of supplies.
			</p>
			<p>
				High tech weaponry is only advantages on alien soil in conventional, linear warfare. Air power and nuclear weapons WOULD NOT be used on one&rsquo;s own country, due to the repercussions from collateral damages, which would set the entire population against the government.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keep in mind that any government on earth is powerless against an overwhelming domestic force of citizens and that, especially in America where there are over about 200 million firearms in the hands of about 100 million people, there aren&rsquo;t enough military and police to occupy and control a couple, three states, let alone the entire country from coast to coast.
			</p>
			<p>
				No government on earth could ever withstand the surge of a popular uprising and would fall in any such conflict.
			</p>
			<p>
				Don&rsquo;t be so over-awed with public relations data from the defense department. They are in power because they have our permission. When that is withdrawn, they&rsquo;re either going to have to step down or they&rsquo;ll be thrown out. They&rsquo;re not as great as you give them credit for.

				To those of you who think democracy without secession can still fix our demographic problems, I&rsquo;d like to point out that about 50% of babies born in the US today are non-white, and the young generation coming of age now heavily favors Obama and is probably the most liberal generation since the 60s, if not ever.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am quite confident that whites will develop a racial consciousness, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s plausible that it will happen before white voters are a minority in the US. For that to happen, essentially all whites would have to be race realists within the next few decades. That means that new young white voters would have to be race realists, and lots of brainwashed liberals would have to switch sides. I don&rsquo;t see how that&rsquo;s plausible, especially when current trends are going in the other direction. Even in South Africa, which is much further along than we are, lots of white liberals remain liberal, so don&rsquo;t expect our liberals to see the light. They will die out, and their grandchildren will be on our side, but they themselves won&rsquo;t change.
			</p>
			<p>
				Basically, we&rsquo;re not going to practice identity politics like minorities do until we ARE minorities.
			</p>
			<p>
				The only slightly plausible scenarios which don&rsquo;t have the US becoming a third-world country in the next century are either red-state secession or some sort of right-wing military coup - which is unlikely but less unlikely than turning all of those stuffwhitepeoplelike.com types into race realists.
			</p>
			<p>
				The MOST plausible scenario for the future of the US is something a lot like Brazil.

				&#8220;gee vee, if and when we do start a break-away from the United States, it won&rsquo;t necessarily be U.S. trrops firing upon us, it will more than likely be United Nations troops that will engage us.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				I don&rsquo;t Know about that. UN troops are notorious for &#8220;Cuttin&rsquo; &amp; Runnin&rsquo;&#8221; if anyone fires so much as a warning shot in their general direction!

				TO: question diversity. Not all military are &#8220;TRAINED DOGS&#8221;. I recently completed a 20 year career. Just because I was trained in various military disciplines doesn&rsquo;t mean I lost my mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				What a rotten comment to make. You probably spent no time in the military or have a close relationship with someone who does other than a disgruntled person.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would never have fired on someone in this country if it went against my own principles. Those principles are conservative. I would not have fought my own countrymen if they rose up in a rebellion which I knew to be just. I think we need men and women on the inside who will help if the time ever comes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Spend some time reading the life on George Washington. He didn&rsquo;t win the war with a great military. He won through countless guerilla warfare campaigns. It was only with the help of the French that we won major battles. With a modern military, if force becomes inevitable, you will be GLAD there are TRAINED DOGS on the inside who know who and how to fight.

				The modern military is VERY well indoctrinated into the new multi CULT garbage, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone one of us ever bought it or still do.
			</p>
			<p>
				I loved the comment above about not letting the whites leave because there would be no one to pay the taxes. That was priceless and sadly so very true.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have have relatives living under black majority rule, Selma Al. The stories I could tell some from personal experience my white friends who live apart from the black horde would simply not believe could be allowed to happen in a civil society.
			</p>
			<p>
				I dread what is coming under an obama and Chicago gangland rule. Those of us who don&rsquo;t have enough money to buy some power protection will have to find some way to band together.

				Very, very good Post, MoMo.

				If you have not already, I suggest that you continue this excellent post in a more concise fashion, and see that some WN publisher (?) would offer this to the public - like Leon DeGrelle, most men who have &#8216;been there&rsquo; can tell a great story, with tremendous appeal.

				As someone whose political affiliations lean to the right, the fact that the Los Angeles Times is printing a story like this should raise a few red flags in people&rsquo;s minds. One of the basic tenets of left-wing ideology is that America is evil and must be destroyed.

				I am for it as it is the only way to save the way things were. Look at history, every time the white establishment includes blacks, or turns over any power to blacks the whole system falls within a couple of years. Southern Africa is a perfect example. Once proud, booming white countries turn over the power to the whiney blacks and waaalaaa &mdash; &mdash; communism, corrupton, hunger, disease and war! The US is headed in that direction unless the white people regain control of THEIR country.

				The comments here, both for secession and against both demonstrate a lack of long-term thinking.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;m pro-secession based on racial grounds. However, like the people here against secession - the thought of giving up the U.S. to other races makes me ill, whites built this country, it&rsquo;s ours and it always will be.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, consider this - if secession based on race is successful, this means that the majority of whites have finally realized (or rather, remembered) that different ethnicities are in fact different from us, and not in a good way. After we implement racial indoctrination in all public forums of education (we can&rsquo;t have future generations forgetting what caused this lunacy in the first place), what&rsquo;s to stop us from taking back the rest of the U.S. from the other races several generations later after the areas under their control fail miserably.
