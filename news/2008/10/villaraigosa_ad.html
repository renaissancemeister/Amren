<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/la-me-blacklatino7-2008oct07,0,4714990.story">Villaraigosa Addresses Perceived Tensions Between Blacks and Latinos</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phil Willon, Los Angeles Times, October 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa on Monday said Latinos and African Americans must &#8220;face up to&#8221; existing racial strains over jobs, language differences and violent crime by addressing the underlying causes of those tensions, primarily poverty and the lack of opportunity.</p>
<p>At the same time Villaraigosa dismissed those who believe that such tensions define the relationship between blacks and Latinos &#8220;as if it&rsquo;s endemic to our DNA to have conflict.&#8221;</p>
<p>Villaraigosa waded into the volatile issue of race at the National Black Latino Summit, a conference of community leaders and organizers who came to Los Angeles to tighten bonds between the nation&rsquo;s two largest minority groups and counter the &#8220;hyperventilating&#8221; over perceptions of a racial divide.</p>
<p>Though he acknowledged that recent gang violence and schoolyard brawls between blacks and Latinos in Los Angeles have drawn national attention and must be addressed, Villaraigosa emphasized the long history of blacks and Latinos working and living together. Blacks and Latinos joined together in the fight for civil rights, he said, and today Los Angeles is filled with thriving multiethnic neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The tension really comes from the struggle for survival, not race,&#8221; Lee [The Rev. Eric P. Lee, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles] said. &#8220;We all want the same thing. We all want a quality of life that speaks to dignity, respect and economic opportunity.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Ok, basic common sense 101.  In order to solve a problem, you have to at least identify it in the first place.</p>
<p>Blacks and hispanics simply do not like each other.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But &ldquo;tensions&rdquo; have nothing to do with race, just poverty and lack of opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is pretenses like this that will assure the ongoing black/Hispanic race war will continue on and accelerate, because the radical leftists believe that pretending the problem doesn&rsquo;t exist will make it go away eventually, but that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve been doing all along now, and obviously it has gotten worse.</p>
<p>The black/Hispanic problem is the result of inter-group hatred of one another, because both groups are polar opposites in almost everything.  The rank and file have no common ground, and they don&rsquo;t want to find any.  Only the leaders of each group need and want an alliance with the other, and it is only for the purpose of unification against their common enemy, the white race.  Even they dislike each other intensely.</p>
<p>Of course they&rsquo;ll fail to achieve any kind of peace, and their hatred of one another not only will result in more of the same it will very likely intensify to the point of open armed conflict.</p>
<p>Some even believe warfare between the two groups will be the spark that ignites large scale civil upheaval.</p>

<p>Well, blacks and latinos can start by not having a 50%+ high school drop-out rate. How about taking advantage of the opportunity of getting a <b>free</b> high school education? It&rsquo;s not a &#8220;lack of opportunity&#8221; holding them back, but the lack of not taking advantage of an opportunity. But, then again, this would require a mindset of taking responsibility for your actions (or non-actions)&hellip;instead of simply blaming Whitey.</p>

<p>Just poverty and opportunity, i.e. it&rsquo;s the white man&rsquo;s fault. And saying so, in a progressive article like this one, reduces tensions all around. At least, reduces tension for all those who are considered people. </p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;The tension really comes from the struggle for survival, not race,&rdquo; &ldquo;We all want the same thing. We all want a quality of life that speaks to dignity, respect and economic opportunity.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick and tired of the &#8216;we-all-want-the-same-thing&rsquo; argument.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe, it&rsquo;s true that black and hispanic parents want their children to get quality educations but the problem is that whites are irreconcilable at odds with how to achieve this goal by the standards of blacks and hispanics.</p>
<p>When left alone, white parents can easily educate their children by white standards of education. Blacks and hispancis cannot be educated by white standards regardless as to how much we all want the same thing.</p>
<p>Blacks and hispancis fail in black and hispanic schools and black and hispancis fail in white schools. It&rsquo;s nature not nurture.<br>

			<p>The claim that blacks and latinos worked together in the civil rights movement is just false. They almost exclusively worked separately for their own racial agendas. Read your history books, Mr. Vilaraigosa. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of a line in the movie where James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) says to &#8220;Jinx&#8221; (Hallie Berry): &#8220;Just because we&rsquo;re on the same side, doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re after the same thing&#8221;.</p>
<p>For once, Hollywood actually got something right.</p>
<p>Just because a Bantu or mestizo attends college, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they want a degree, or even to attend for four years. </p>

<p>This may be true. We had a poster point out, about some minority juveniles in court, if they were given judgeships too they also would be able to behave themselvs. It seems that it is only ignorant white folks who are able to behave themselves. <br>

			<p> Blacks and Latinos have a &#8220;long history of working and living together&#8221;? Where, pray tell? On the moon? Anytime you have two groups with two different cultures, two different languages, and easily identifiable physical differences, and they are living in relatively close proximity to each other, you&rsquo;re going to have conflict. It&rsquo;s happened over and over in this country between Whites and blacks; in Malaysia between Malays and Chinese; in certain South Seas island nations between native Polynesians and immigrant Asians.</p>
<p>  You don&rsquo;t even have to have two groups who look markedly different from each other. Look at Rwanda, where two different tribes of Africans massacred each other. Look at Belgium, where the Flemings and Walloons have unresolved disputes going back to the founding of the kingdom in 1830.</p>
<p>  Mayor Villaraigosa wants to pretend that this all stems from &#8220;poverty&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221; (in other words, it&rsquo;s all the White man&rsquo;s fault   &mdash;   yet again), but if he really believes that, he&rsquo;s probably not smart enough to continue as mayor.</p>

			<p>The only real solution is to clear them out. Deport and keep deporting until they are gone. Then prevent them from returning. Problem solved. A hard reset. Do that and life can return to normal the way it should be. The way it once was.</p>

			<p>For one thing this is AMERICA there should be NO LANGUAGE DIFFERENCES if this is where a person wants to live, and secondly Hispanics hands aren&rsquo;t tied like most whites feel they are when it comes to expressing their TRUE RACIAL FEELINGS which most often are based on THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES with the person Not Of Their Race. P&gt;S&gt; Sorry I seemed to exclude Hispanics from being called WHITE that&rsquo;s what they call them if they are ARRESTED, they are only Hispanic when applying for some entitlement..</p>

			<p>The whole black leadership in Lost Angeles County, California, is a joke, a bad joke. It regularly misleads black youth, and is utterly useless to them. On the illegal immigration front, they side with hispanics against their own and as a result the black youth can&rsquo;t even find a part time job, because of the illegal aliens who have invaded their neighborhoods. The black leadership knows this, but is stuck in a nineteen sixties, jaded, fighting for civil rights, time warp. Witness writers like Earl Ofari Hutchinson or politicians like Maxine Waters. They still have them believing that the struggle involves overcoming &#8220;the man&#8221;. They have no positive vision for the youth at all. There is a Reverend Jesse Peterson who tries to help black youths and others to take personal responsibility, but, just like Bill Cosby, he has the full forces of the corrupt black leadership lined up against him. It&rsquo;s a mess. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but I forgot to add the conclusion to my last post, since the story is about Villaraigosa, and his claim that the sturggle between blacks and hispanics in L.A. is not about race but opportunity. This is true, because Villaraigosa&rsquo;s support of millions of illegal aliens has deprived the black youth of even getting a part time job. So the struggle, for Villaraigosa, is about race afterall.</p>
