<h1><a href="http://www.torontosun.com/news/columnists/michele_mandel/2008/10/27/7216281-sun.html">Hockey is Dying in T.O.</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michele Mandel, Toronto Sun, Oct. 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Imagine a time in this city when most kids don&rsquo;t start off their Saturday mornings by donning skates and taking to the ice. </p>
<p>A time when hockey pales beside soccer and cricket and basketball. A time when Canada&rsquo;s national game is dying a slow and painful death. </p>
<p>Now, imagine that time is now. </p>
<p>Not in Toronto, you say. Not here, in the home of the Maple Leafs, the centre of the hockey universe that has raised the likes of Syl Apps, Ken Dryden and Kevin Weekes. </p>
<p>But what used to be a Canadian rite of passage for most Toronto boys &mdash; and, increasingly, girls as well &mdash; is in grave danger because this city&rsquo;s demographics have changed and the old guard in the amateur hockey world have been too slow and set in their ways to reach out to new immigrants. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, it&rsquo;s seen as a white sport,&rdquo; says Ken Jeffers, manager of access and diversity for City of Toronto parks and recreation. </p>
<p>&ldquo;When we look at kids born here from parents who come from warm countries, hockey is not part of their experience. It&rsquo;s not part of their world, the players are not seen as their heroes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But they need to be introduced because it is the Canadian sport and it&rsquo;s a great catalyst to bringing people together.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He was instrumental in launching &ldquo;Hockey in the Neighbourhood&rdquo; about eight years ago, a program that each year helps several hundred kids from diverse communities discover hockey for free. </p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not enough. </p>
<p>According to John Gardner of the Greater Toronto Hockey League, only 40,000 kids are registered at some level of hockey out of the 950,000 children under the age of 14 in the GTA. </p>
<p>The situation is most dire in Scarborough where plummeting enrolment has seen the Wexford Hockey Association fold completely as well as the house leagues of the Scarborough Young Leafs, Agincourt Lions and Malvern Penguins. </p>
<p>&ldquo;House league enrolment is dropping 10% a year,&rdquo; says a worried John Kelloway, president of the troubled Scarborough Hockey Association. &ldquo;Back in the mid-80s, we had 10,000 kids. Now we have 3,000.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The situation is dire, he says, because it took so long for the old establishment to recognize that outreach was critical to new Canadians, especially with so many traditionally hockey-playing families moving out of the GTA. &ldquo;The Scarborough Hockey Association has done a lousy job of appealing to those communities and getting them involved,&rdquo; Kelloway admits. &ldquo;The old farts like myself have been so set in our ways. But if we don&rsquo;t change, the competitive side of the Scarborough league will die.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Tonight, he says, they are meeting to discuss the drastic action they should have taken long ago. They plan to completely restructure so that there is just one house league, greatly reduce registration fees by as much as 30% from the current $420 and seek professionals to help them reach out to ethnic families. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a selling job ahead of us,&rdquo; Kelloway says. </p>
<p>And Scarborough is not alone. Some house leagues in North York have also collapsed and others are in trouble. </p>
<p>Gardner of the GTHL acknowledges the problem, but the league&rsquo;s sole solution at this point is a plan to print and distribute brochures in four different languages. </p>
<p>The problem is that even if these kids do want to play, registration and equipment can easily top $700 &mdash; out of reach for many new immigrants struggling to establish themselves, not to mention most working class Torontonians. And beyond house league, the costs soar well over $1,500. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to let everyone come for free,&rdquo; says the GTHL president, who complains Toronto hiked ice rates by 10% this year. &ldquo;Unfortunately, the city does nothing to help us in that regard.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The danger, they all agree, is that hockey is becoming only a sport that rich, white kids can afford to play. </p>
<p>That concerns New Jersey Devils&rsquo; goalie Kevin Weekes, who grew up near Christie Pits with parents originally from Barbados who both worked long overtime hours to afford his hockey dream. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Costs have risen so dramatically that there&rsquo;s a bunch of us who have said there&rsquo;s no way any of us would be playing in the league now,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We came from working class backgrounds and it was a stretch for our parents then. Now, it&rsquo;s just too cost-prohibitive and for new Canadians, it&rsquo;s even more of a challenge.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He tries to do his part &mdash; for years he ran and funded Skillz, the hockey program he attended as a teen which coaches players from diverse backgrounds. And, just this past summer, he was at the Wellesley Community Centre with Philadelphia Flyer and Regent Park-native Glenn Metropolit to donate 110 sets of kids&rsquo; hockey equipment from the NHL Players&rsquo; Association. </p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t think the GTHL or Hockey Canada is doing enough to keep costs down and reach out to visible minorities. &ldquo;I am definitely worried a lot of kids will say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll play basketball. Hockey is just a rich man&rsquo;s game.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the perception,&rdquo; Weekes says, &ldquo;and to some degree, that&rsquo;s the reality.&rdquo; </p>
<p>With hockey days in some parts of Toronto soon to be just a memory. <br>

			<p>I certainly hope that hockey doesn&rsquo;t die out&hellip;it is the only sport without blacks, and I for one am so sick of black sports, baseball, football, basketball, boring boring boring&hellip;.and the pay they get, OUTRAGOUS!!! Plus they are a terrible example for children&hellip;..even the college players are contaminated when there are more black than whites on the team!!!</p>

			<p>&#8220;hockey as a sport for &#8216;rich, white kids.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Canada. That should be considered hate crime. Let&rsquo;s stop the real hate.   <br>

<p>It has nothing to do with reaching out to new immigrants. When you change the racial, cultural and ethnic makeup of a country, state or city, then the culture changes. Hockey is a white Canadian sport and part of their culture. When Toronto or anywhere is filled with those who are non-white/Canadians, then the culture changes to reflect this. </p>

			<p>The author seems to regret the fact that non-whites are not taking to the game of hockey. I think it is a positive development that hockey may be restricted to whites only. Who wants to see packs of non-whites play hockey? Just think of the job opportunities in pro hockey. Why would whites actually pay and subsidize a system to give these positions to non-whites in the future? If the non-whites do not play, then the rinks in Toronto (a scarce resource) can be better utilized by the remaining whites.<br>
    Let&rsquo;s keep hockey white as long as we can &hellip;.</p>

			<p>Give up Toronto. Third worlders will never play hockey. In Minnesota, the hockey state, a public high school from Minneapolis has not been in the state hockey tournament for over 20 years. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll worry about blacks and other third worlders in hockey when the NBA and NFL are down to 13% black.</p>

			<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s because hockey was always a sport for at least lower-middle class kids, the majority of whom in Toronto are (still) white. It&rsquo;s pretty much down to the equipment, which is more expensive than any other sport.</p>
<p>I grew up in an overwhelmingly Jamaican neighborhood (Vaughn and Oakwood) and the most popular sport was soccer, and most of the kids who played it were just poorer, period. White, Asian, Central and South American and Black,&hellip; pretty much down to the fact that you just need a ball. There were even more soccer players than baseball (where you need a glove, minimum).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a class thing, really. I have no patience for any of the enforced multiculturalism (which just makes everyone more ignorant than they were to begin with.. largely because of the &#8216;enforced&rsquo; part), but it&rsquo;s a little rich for the Toronto Star (probably the worst example of such yellow journalism) to wring their hands over the demise of hockey. They make poverty seem like it&rsquo;s divided along racial lines, and that is horse puckey. Money doesn&rsquo;t flow according to race, it flows to those who know how or are organized enough to extract it from the economy,&hellip; like the Canadian public service unions (hardly a bastion of white privilege, if you&rsquo;ve been to a government office lately)</p>

			<p>I am a real hard hockey fan, but not of the Toronto Maple Leafs!! I am a fan of the Ottawa Senators.</p>
<p>Hockey is dying in Toronto&hellip;.  let me tell you, that is a pure joke.  The season tickets for the Toronto Maple Leafs are sold out for the next ten years.  It makes me laugh to hear hockey in Toronto is dying.  The Ottawa Senators and the Montreal Canadiens&rsquo; fan base might not be as strong and faithful as the Maple Leafs&rsquo;, but the Senators and Canadiens always sell out their games as well.  There is the hockey hall of fame right in the heart of downtown Toronto, and it is considered as one of the landmarks in Toronto.  </p>
<p>Let me assure you: the hockey in Toronto is not even close to dead yet.  </p>
<p>You will notice that the Toronto Maple Leafs does not perform very well and misses playoffs pretty much every year.  There is a reason that the Maple Leafs is not doing well, and it is because the fan base is too strong.  With that strong fanbase, there is no need for the management to bring a quality product on the ice, and the management is spoiled and the Maple Leafs and its fans have to suffer sheer mediocrity every year.  </p>
<p>If there is any sport that is dying in Toronto, it is baseball and football.  Basketball seems to be stable at the moment.  The fans of Toronto Blue Jays of MLB are worried everyday that the Blue Jays might move to some other city in the States.  </p>
<p>Here is a collage I designed with Adobe Photoshop many years ago&hellip; the current Senators does not even wear the same jersey.</p>

<p>If there is one truth I agree with this article, yes many of the immigrants are neither familiar with hockey nor able to financially afford to have their young male children play the game.  Hockey is one of the most expensive sports to play in the world.   </p>

			<p>Almost as late as the mid 1970&rsquo;s Toronto was virtually an all-White city. What do you expect? You violently and needlessly change the racial makeup and demography of a city and you also change its culture, including its sports and recreation preferences. The real question should have been why were the changes ever made?</p>

			<p>There was no problem with the realisation of hockey being an expensive sport which I once briefly participated in myself here in Britain, until Toronto became deluged with non-white Third World enrichers.</p>
<p>What the present fuss is <b>really</b> all about, is the fact that the sport has been predominately white up until now and the Marxist social engineers are determined to destroy that anomaly.<br>
For instance, you don&rsquo;t see them criticising Indian/Pakistani style cricket and Indian domination thereof and/or forcing these Asians to adapt their culturally influenced styles of play to a more inclusive non-Indian version so that non-Asian races with their differing cultural mores, can engage on a more equal basis in this sport, for example.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Enough said! </p>

			<p>People need to research what&rsquo;s going on in American - and now Canadian sports. While blacks have an advantage over whites in sprinting ability, whites have been brainwashed into inferiority, an inferiority that keeps them from stepping back and looking at the big picture. This all ties into the story above.</p>
<p>In the US, the NFL combines are used to test draft prospects. Whites do very well. Yet they are ignored, and inferior black players will get the nod most of time, and all of the time in certain positions. A few independent minded writers have finally begun remarking on white players who would be great running backs, are constantly being moved to fullback, etc in order to have a black player fill a spot. This goes on with cornerbacks, receivers, safety, defensive linemen etc. The league is also going out of its way to push black quarterbacks down the white public&rsquo;s collective throat, even though they are generally mediocre at best. This is all conditioning. The media controls the league in the end, and to please the media&hellip; you see how this works. I&rsquo;m simplifying it, but it&rsquo;s now becoming more and more obvious, especially with the awful quarterbacks and inept offensive linemen who are heaped with praise simply because of their black skin. </p>
<p>In baseball, Bud Selig and his crew have worked around the clock to fill the league with non-white foreign players, mainly from Latin America, even when white minor leaguers and white college players are better. Even Steve Sailer had to admit this was true after taking a look at statistics and actual game performance. Why? More conditioning to make whites feel second rate. They can&rsquo;t fill the spots with black Americans, so in come the latins and asians. Don&rsquo;t worry, MLB is building academies to help inner-city blacks make it in the game.</p>
<p>The NBA, well, rules were ignored to put it nicely, in order to cater to black strengths in play. Since blacks generally lack in fundamentals, ignoring traveling, palming, ups and downs, etc allows them to get up speed for a dunk etc. When held to the actual rules as written, our NBA players spent 12 years getting beat by European and S. American (mostly white) teams, until officials ignored rules - only for the Americans - in Beijing. It was interesting to see officials in Beijing whistle the American&rsquo;s opponents for fouls and infractions and then see the Americans do the exact same thing within seconds and &hellip; no whistle. One wonders how much money NBA commissioner David Stern and pals forwarded to the IOC, which brings us to the NHL.</p>
<p>Gary Bettman, David Stern&rsquo;s assistant, became head of the NHL a few years ago. How this happened when he had never watched a full hockey game or knew much about the sport is a mystery. Sort of. Turns out media types told the league that they should try to broaden their appeal beyond just the typical white fan. And Bettman, who worked with an &#8220;urban&#8221; sport, basketball, could do that. Well, it&rsquo;s become obvious the outreach programs to blacks and latinos aren&rsquo;t working, and they were never intended to work. What is really going on is that Bettman and his crew of lawyers are slowly trying to dismantle, destroy the league. Why? It&rsquo;s a &#8216;white sport&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s why. Go ahead and &#8220;google&#8221; this if you don&rsquo;t think so. There really is a war against whites, and whites are too blind to see it, and have been brainwashed to think that any &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; talk is silly.  If conspiracies didn&rsquo;t exist, they wouldn&rsquo;t be illegal, and in fact in the US, we wouldn&rsquo;t have had the Immigration Act of 1965 without conspiracy. </p>
<p>Lots of conspiracies in sports. Track officials in the US covered up for Carl Lewis and droves of black athletes for 20 years when it came to drug use. However, any white athlete in the US caught on drugs was hung more publicly than any of the recent effigies in the news. Officials in tennis wanted to institute drug testing, the first and loudest voice against it was Serena Williams. Think there might be some &#8220;smoke&#8221; in her immediate vicinity?  Step back and look at things. Stop taking them at face value. </p>
