<p>A lot of politicians and, now we know, a lot of Wall Street CEOs are &#8220;doing the three-monkey thing.&#8221; It was their hear-no-evil, see-no-evil, and, above all, speak-no-evil attitude towards lowered lending standards &mdash; to close the white-minority &#8220;home ownership gap&#8221; &mdash; that caused the immense destruction of wealth of recent months.</p>
<p>Contemplating the wreckage brings to mind another gap, the white-minority &#8220;achievement gap.&#8221; Attempts to close this gap have also produced a spectacle of destruction, if one knows how to look. Let&rsquo;s take a glance before proceeding to the Wall Street variation.</p>
<p>{snip} This comment appeared under one of the perennial reports on the achievement gap:</p>
<p>&#8220;As a long-term veteran teacher of the Oakland schools, I can only say that I completely dread the likely professional development which is surely to come, in which white teachers will again be told how culturally insensitive we are and how we fail at teaching. I have been hearing this (it&rsquo;s nothing new) for my entire tenure of nearly two decades in the district. I have been called a racist for every imaginable reason .&bnsp;.&nbsp;. except actual racism. Both black parents and students assume racism on the part of white teachers, and it&rsquo;s up to you to prove otherwise.&nbsp;.&bnsp;.&nbsp;. {snip} (&#8220;Summit called to address racial disparities in academic performance,&#8221; San Francisco Chronicle, November 12, 2007) (1)</p>
<p>To close &#8220;the home ownership gap,&#8221; similarly deluded minds decided to target lenders &mdash; to increase their &#8220;cultural sensitivity&#8221; one might say. The subprime lending fiasco and the near-collapse of the financial system are the results.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>First, here&rsquo;s Andrew Cuomo, President Clinton&rsquo;s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in an April, 1998 press conference, announcing an &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; settlement with Accubank, a Texas bank. HUD forced Accubank to provide 2.1 billion dollars in risky mortgages to low-income Americans. The latter five minutes of this eight-minute video features Barack Obama explaining his own efforts as community organizer working for ACORN to force banks to make high-risk loans. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivmL-lXNy64" target="housing" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none">(2)</a></p>
<p>Next, watch President George W. Bush in 2002 cheerleading the attack on lending standards: seven-minute video. Excerpt: &#8221; &hellip; few(er) than half of the Hispanics and half the African Americans own the(ir) home &hellip; We&rsquo;ve got to work to knock down the barriers that have created a home ownership gap.&#8221; Signal to bank regulators: ease up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The videos give the gist of what&rsquo;s behind the market meltdown: not free markets, not deregulation. Delusional and/or corrupt social engineering brought disaster.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>1977 &mdash; The &#8220;Community Reinvestment Act&#8221; (CRA) is signed into law by President Jimmy Carter. The CRA mandates that each banking institution be evaluated to determine if it has met the credit needs of its entire community. The purpose is to ensure that under-served populations can obtain credit, including home ownership opportunities.</p>
<p>1980s &mdash; ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) and other community organizations accuse banks of &#8220;redlining&#8221; &mdash; discriminating against minorities in mortgage lending.</p>
<p>1989 &mdash; Congress amends the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act to force banks to collect racial data on mortgage applicants. The 1989 legislation requires a four-tiered CRA rating system for banks: &#8220;Outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;Satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;Needs to Improve,&#8221; or &#8220;Substantial Noncompliance&#8221;:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>1992 &mdash; July &mdash; A Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study indicates that &#8220;even after controlling for financial, employment, and neighborhood characteristics, black and Hispanic mortgage applicants in the Boston metropolitan area are roughly 60 percent more likely to be turned down than whites.&#8221; The study suggests racism is behind the higher loan denial rate.</p>
<p>1992 &mdash; A Democratic-majority Congress requires &#8220;that Fannie and Freddie increase purchases of mortgages for low-income and medium-income borrowers.&#8221; Fannie agrees to &#8220;buy more loans with very low down payments &mdash; or with mortgage payments that represent an unusually high percentage of a buyer&rsquo;s income.&#8221; (3)</p>
<p>1993 &mdash; Forbes Magazine queries Boston Fed Senior Vice President and Research Director Alicia H. Munnell on the default rates of black and white mortgage holders in the Boston Fed&rsquo;s 1992 study purporting to show that racism is behind the higher loan denial rate for blacks. The reporters learn that the default rates on loans of whites and minorities are equal. This indicates no discrimination, they point out to Munnell. &#8220;[That] is a sophisticated point,&#8221; she replies. &#8220;You need that [lower default rates for blacks] as a confirming piece of evidence. And we don&rsquo;t have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forbes: Did you ever ask the question that if defaults appear to be more or less the same among blacks and whites, that points to mortgage lenders making rational decisions?</p>
<p>Munnell: No &hellip; I do believe that discrimination occurs.</p>
<p>Forbes: You have no evidence?</p>
<p>Munnell: I do not have evidence.&nbsp; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No one has evidence.</p>
<p>1994 &mdash; Barack Obama represents Calvin Robertson in a lawsuit against Citibank &#8220;charging the bank systematically denied mortgages to African-American applicants and others from minority neighborhoods.&#8221;</p>
<p>1994 &mdash; The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act repeals restrictions on interstate banking, beginning a wave of bank mergers. This gives activist groups like ACORN &#8220;power to demand more loans to their constituents because CRA allowed them to charge noncompliance and stop such mergers.&#8221; (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>1995 &mdash; President Clinton establishes new CRA regulations &#8220;requiring numerical assessments to get a satisfactory CRA rating; using federal home-loan data broken down by neighborhood, income group, and race; encouraging community groups to complain when banks were not loaning enough to specified neighborhood, income group, and race&#8221; and &#8220;allowing community groups that marketed loans to targeted groups to collect a fee from the banks.&#8221; (Ibid)</p>
<p>1996 &mdash; A study by the Federal Reserve System and academic specialists finds &mdash; like the 1993 Forbes investigation &mdash; no evidence &#8220;of substantial levels of bias in mortgage lending.&#8221; Quoting from the abstract of the study:</p>
<p>&#8220;Results of the analysis fail to find evidence of better performance on loans granted to minority borrowers. Indeed, black borrowers are found, all else being equal, to exhibit a higher likelihood of mortgage default than other borrowers. These findings argue against allegations of substantial levels of bias in mortgage lending.&#8221;</p>
<p>1996 &mdash; The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires that 42% of the mortgages purchased by Fannie and Freddie should be held by borrowers earning below the median income for their area; 12% should be &#8220;special affordable&#8221; loans typically held by borrowers earning 60% of their area&rsquo;s median income. Note how HUD ratchets up these requirements in 2000 and then again in 2005. (5)</p>
<p>1997 &mdash; Bear Stearns, one of the largest global investment banks, makes the first public securitization of Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) loans.</p>
<p>1998 &mdash; HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo announces an &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; settlement with a Texas Bank forcing it to provide 2.1 billion dollars in high risk mortgages to low-income Americans. {snip}</p>
<p>1998 &mdash; The Clinton administration authorizes Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase subprime mortgages to satisfy their affordable housing obligations. Note these prophetic paragraphs in a 1999 New York Times report on Freddie and Fannie&rsquo;s expanded mission:<blockqauote>In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980&rsquo; s.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the perspective of many people, including me, this is another thrift industry growing up around us,&rsquo; said Peter Wallison, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. &#8220;If they fail, the government will have to step up and bail them out the way it stepped up and bailed out the thrift industry.&#8221;</blockquote>1999 &mdash; Finance professors at the University of Illinois and at Wichita State University report findings on the creditworthiness of minorities consistent with the 1993 Forbes report and the 1996 Federal Reserve study cited earlier:</p>
<p>&#8220;[E]verything else being the same, minority applicants are probably less creditworthy, on average, than whites. Therefore, in the absence of fair lending laws, it is likely that minorities would be denied loans more frequently than whites and would pay higher interest rates and fees on approved loans.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [F]air-lending laws have the perverse effect of forcing lenders to cross-subsidize minority borrowers from the higher profits they earn on white borrowers. Such cross-subsidization is inherently &lsquo;unfair&rsquo; because it works as a tax on one group that is used as a subsidy for another.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>2000 &mdash; HUD requires that 50% of the mortgages purchased by Fannie and Freddie should be held by borrowers earning below the median income for their area; 20% should be &#8220;special affordable&#8221; loans typically held by borrowers earning 60% of an area&rsquo;s median income. (5)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>2004-2007 &mdash; Fannie and Freddie accelerate their high-risk lending. Peter J. Wallison (the same Peter Wallison who predicted the current crisis in 1999) and co-author Charles W. Calomiris, explain:<blockquote>&#8220;In order to curry congressional support after their accounting scandals in 2003 and 2004, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac committed to increased financing of &lsquo;affordable housing.&rsquo; They became the largest buyers of subprime and Alt-A mortgages between 2004 and 2007, with total GSE exposure eventually exceeding $1 trillion. In doing so, they .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. substantially magnified the costs of its collapse .&#8221;</blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>2005 &mdash; HUD requires that 52% of the mortgages purchased by Fannie and Freddie should be held by borrowers earning below the median income for their area; 22% should be &#8220;special affordable&#8221; loans typically held by borrowers earning 60% of their area&rsquo;s median income. (5)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What to make of these events, studies, people?</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s effort to &#8220;close the white-minority home ownership gap&#8221; is a social engineering project with colossal &#8220;cost overruns.&#8221; The project is akin &mdash; in quality of leadership, in denial of reality, in results for intended beneficiaries, in terrible costs imposed on the taxpayers &mdash; to our government schooling monopolies&rsquo; forty-year obsession with closing the white-minority academic achievement gap.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The subprime mortgage fiasco gives us a chance anew to study an American proclivity, the PC-blinded calamity. The financial meltdown has unique particulars from which much can be learned. But it belongs to a special category of failure that ought to be studied as such. I hope to examine those particulars and that category in a subsequent piece.</p>

			<p>what about the fact that Alan Greenspan was warned of the &#8216;housing bubble&rsquo; and discounted it long before the meltdown occured. I personally saw multiple examples of mortgage fraud back in 01-you cant tell me that this was brought to no ones attention in Washington? the truth is that there were way to many people making money off this real estate feeding frenzy -and many mortgages originated as loans  made to investors. the people on wall st loved the lowered borrowing standards-because they knew the people they were selling these higher risk mortgages to loved them.</p>

			<p>Immigration enthusiast have claimed for years that post-1965 non-white immigrants and their offspring are an economic benefit to Native Born White America. With the subprime mortgage meltdown, we have more evidence-very powerfull and dramatic in fact-that this is a patent lie. An enormous number of poor hispanics,nigerians,ghanians -and you can probably throw in the Portuguese in places such as Newark- who were given these loans.</p>
<p>The subprime crisis could not have occured if there wasn&rsquo;t a huge market to exploit  of post-1965 non-whites and their &#8220;American&#8221; born offspring deperately in need of middle class housing to realize their American dream.</p>
<p>The subprime mortgage meltdown also exposes another fact about America in 2008-9 and it is this:the reosurces of America are in fact scarce. If there was a lot more available land in America and lot more housing to go along with it, the subprime housing crisis would never have happened. Housing would be cheap like it was before the passage of the 1965 immigration refrom act which has set into motion demographic forces that are massively increasing the size of the US population.</p>
<p>Both McCain and Obama immigration policies will push the US population to one billion in 25 years.</p>
<p>America is a very great risk of becoming an ecological disaster area very soon. Post-1965 non-whites will demand afordable middle class housing. To keep the social peace, plant and animal species and ecosystems will be destroyed.</p>
<p>If Native Born White Ameicans choose secession as a solution, the White areas of the country will experience significqnt new population growth. Middle class housing demand will result in animal and plant species and whole ecosystems being detroyed. A large White population in the White areas will not be sustainable at a middle class standard of living. The non-white areas will be eologically a scene from hell. The new border arrangements will not protect you from the ecological catastrophes in the non-white areas. Secessionist are without a doubt infantile in their thinking. </p>
<p>This is the larger context in which the subprime mortgage should be understood.</p>

			<p>One thing that isn&rsquo;t evident about the subprime crisis is has it been fixed?  Can blacks and hispanics with bad credit still take out loans?  I think the answer is yes because the laws that initiated this whole disaster are still on the books.   </p>

			<p>When I first got involved in real estate sales in 1975, it was gospel that you didn&rsquo;t even try to sell a home to a prospective buyer who would pay more than 30% of his income in PITI each month.</p>
<p>Then, I remember how that changed and people were qualifying with obviously phony docs, phony references, phony income statements, etc.</p>
<p>I understand the motivation for lowering the standards: Make homeowners out of blacks and Latinos and maybe the crime in their communities wouldn&rsquo;t be so high if they had a real stake in those communities.  </p>
<p>And, this might actually work, if it was done on a limited basis.  Unfortunately, it was done nationwide and the system was swamped with unqualified buyers who drove up the prices of homes.</p>
<p>It was a house of cares just waiting to fall.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s nary a mention of the deindustrialization of America that has also contributed to the present crisis.  I once wrote an article about how the American economy had become an upside down pyramid.  </p>
<p>Instead of a wide and healthy base of producers at the bottom, the pyramid was upside down so that the few producers were at the point which was on the bottom holding the whole thing up  &mdash;  but not for long. Completely unstable.</p>

			<p>Good.  Whites are just as much to blame as the minorities who got the loans and couldn&rsquo;t repay.  If whitey loses, he serves to lose.  I hope this one is big.  I hope it&rsquo;s really, really big.  I look forward to seeing whitey on the unemployment line, kicked out of his home, going to market with a wheelbarrow full of money for a loaf of bread, the Commies taking full control of his country.</p>
<p>Goodbye, whitey.  The guy in the mirror is to blame!</p>

			<p>I can tell you that you don&rsquo;t want to see the future.</p>
<p>If you are of white european descent, there will be much pain and suffering.</p>
<p>You can thank your political masters for the break down of order.</p>
<p>The line between order and chaos is very small and we will soon find out what chaos is really like.</p>
<p>Fortunately those that benefited from the corruption will not be able to isolate themselves from the societal meltdown that is coming.</p>
<p>Your personal safety and survival will soon be questionable.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not just &#8220;political correctness&#8221;. It&rsquo;s a Democrat government attempt of redistribution of wealth by sponsorship of minority speculation. Here is a commentary that elaborates on that idea:</p>

			<p>The great pity of this mortgage loan/fraud debacle being the managing officials of the lending institutions not being prosecuted on criminal charges.</p>
<p>Recall a couple of years ago, Nations Bank officials falling over themselves to push credit cards onto the illegals. No questions asked. Virtually no idenfication needed. Might an interested person inquire HOW MANY of these credit cards had been used to the credit card debt limit, then defaulted on?</p>
<p>The motivation to Nations Bank being the high interest rates on credit cards. Plus the hope/idea that by claiming to &#8220;help&#8221; illegals, the feds would come to the Bank&rsquo;s rescue should too many cards be defaulted on by the criminal illegal aliens.</p>

			<p>So, for all us Whites that took out 30-year mortgages becase we HAD good credit, gonna get &#8216;reparations&rsquo; because the Banks took on non-White bad credit risks in the name of &#8216;diversity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yeah, thought so.</p>

<p>  Greenspan certainly deserves part of the blame as do many Democratic and Republican politicians. However, political correctness and utopian fantasies were behind the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and the Clinton modifications, which made possible so many subprime loans to people who couldn&rsquo;t afford them. </p>

			<p>The real issue is not population but wealth creation; the population can be made to decline, as in China. The issue is that,unlike China, which has a growing middle class with every reason to hope for a wealthier future, we don&rsquo;t.Our human resources aren&rsquo;t that promising. You talk about &#8220;animal and plant species&#8221;&hellip;go to a major university and visit the high tech / engineering / hard science departments. The Chinese /East Asian presence is unmistakeable. The African-american non-presence is also unmistakeable. We can&rsquo;t replace our populations with theirs&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s over,man.</p>

<p>Your post is exactly what I am thinking everytime I read about CW2 or read any other scenario that supposes war or conflict as a solution.  However, I do not see how violence on either local or a worldwide basis is going to be prevented.  The U.S. after all, is not an ecologically isolated entity and no amount of legislation or politiking can change that.  When the US population hits one billion,  can we imagine what the worldwide population will be?  What resources will they utilize?  Will they remain behind artificial borders dying of thirst while their neighbor has a well?  For decades, I have recognized that human population growth is what is behind, every, EVERY problem we face.</p>

			<p>There is a second side to this mortgage meltdown issue. Builders and contractors are also deserving of a healthy heap of blame. Using generally ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT labor to throw up hundreds of thousands of houses. Then doing their best to peddle these houses to anyone including low income illegal immigrants, Whites, and Blacks. While cynically claiming to offer a piece of the American Dream to the suckers. With both sellers and bankers full well KNOWING these people would very likely DEFAULT. But such is business, I suppose.</p>
<p>As a rational, thinking person, I can&rsquo;t help but feel outrage over those thousands and thousands of once viable farmland that has been converted to ticky-tacky housing tracts. Yes, even those pricey upscale ones.</p>
<p>We keep hearing about impending food shortages. About flooding caused by water run-off that can no longer filter into the underground water table. Even experts pointing out that we, as a nation, are on the verge of severe freshwater shortages in many parts of our country. Yet no politician has the cajones to say &#8220;NO MORE HOUSING TRACT&#8221; in this area! (Recalling, of course, a prospective builder/developer invariably has to obtain licensing from local authorities.)</p>

			<p>What so totally blows me away about the subprime mortgage fiasco, is the fact that, in finance, the system of money lending usually operates and smoothly because of the simple fact that someone has got to be paid in the end by someon else. The obamination rubber stamped by Congress,is that,that someone else who has to pay up turns out to be the American citizenry. The implications of these criminal actions by the Congress are scary, as they bale out criminal after criminal on the backs of honest Americans. </p>

<p>Scarcity of resources, both food and water, are at dangerously low levels right this minute, and as the influx of warm bodies continues into the US the situation will become more critical.  Some rivers are drying up now, and ground water levels have been down for the last 40 years and are continuing to decline.  Less water translates to fewer crops. This situation is occurring worldwide, which is especially critical in large populations in countries like India and, especially, China.</p>
<p>But, here in the US it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the country opts for secesssion, civil war or what have you, the declines will continue.  The situation is not being adequately addressed, because the country is dysfunctional, and the secession that concerns you might well give way to food and water wars.</p>
<p>Supporting the continuation of economic growth is the epitome of stupidity, but the problem won&rsquo;t be addressed until the plight is directly upon us, the same as every other catastrophe to date.<br>

I doubt that anybody looks at CWII as a solution, but as a natural consequence of the failure of many thing occurring right now all coming together which is bound to cause armed upheaval, and certainly there is much support for the theory.  </p>
<p>Your concern for population growth is absolutely correct, and I agree every other problem is insignificant compared to this.</p>
<p>And, I think that it is a world-wide problem that has more potential to decimate the population of the planet than any religious or political war, but I have no doubt a scarcity of resources will cause much fighting on an international basis, before all is said and done.</p>

<p>With all due respect your post wasn&rsquo;t all that clear, and it never adequately supported your contention that secession wasn&rsquo;t a viable alternative, because you haven&rsquo;t taken into consideration that the average white has no control over the inundation of foreigners, legal and illegal, into this country.</p>
<p>You seem to want to strap on a pack, fix bayonets and charge, when it will assure defeat, instead of taking a more intelligent temporary tact.  Screaming traitor instead of exploring other alternatives only adds a hysterical tone, that lacks credibility and is based in a fanatical desire to plow ahead without intelligently weighing all the pros and cons.</p>
<p>To counter propositions of secession you have to lay out credible points indicating the fallacy of it, not hysterically accuse someone of sedition or of being a traitor because he/she has carefully analyzed the situation and determined it is the most practical military tactic to employ at this time.</p>

			<p>Anybody who has ever run credit on people knows the true story  &mdash;  minorities, especially blacks, simply don&rsquo;t pay their bills and thus, have horrific credit. Having worked in the retail industry for several, I have seen it over and over. If a black person walked into your store, you could rest assured that he/she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get your store credit card. </p>
<p>This is how it goes. When people turn 18, they will usually be able to get a store credit card. They then charge it up to the card&rsquo;s limit, refuse to pay it, then have only bad credit on their record and are unable to get further cards, loans, etc. It&rsquo;s these people to whom the govt arm twisted the banks to lend to; people who can&rsquo;t even get a cell phone account because their credit is so bad. Sprint is the preferred company in the african community because they only required a 150 dollar deposit to activate the account  &mdash;  linked to a 150 dollar spending limit. These people continually paid huge reconnect fees because they never paid their bills until their phones were shut off and thus, were never truly &#8220;current&#8221; on their accounts; another ding on their credit rating.</p>
<p>Low intelligence is inexorably linked to impulsive behavior and likewise to an inability to understand long-term consequences.</p>

<p>The starting point of your criticism of my post is wrong. To put put things into perspetive, Native Born White Americans haven&rsquo;t even begun to flex their poltical muscles yet. At the present time, there have been only been some meager political muscle fasciculations(muscle twitches). But these itty- bitty muscle twitches have already made the Reublican and Democratic elites and post-1965 non-whites very nervous. And the reason why these little twitches have made them nervous is because a full-blown revolt against post-1965 immigration will bring about the complete shut down of post-1965 immigration policy. This is white so much effort is being made to demonize nascent White identity politics. When Hillary Clinton began making a few itty-bitty bleats about White identity politics a few months back, MSM elites went into brain spasms.</p>
<p>Secession will allow the extension of the borders of China,Mexico,India,Pakistan.Korea and Iran deep into the US. You and other secessionists want to pretend that this won&rsquo;t happen. This is a combination of infantile and delusional thinking. With 100 percent certainty it will happen. And when  all the private White Idahos-&#8220;your in your own private Idaho&#8221;- figure this out, Ii will be too late.</p>
<p>China, Mexico,Iran,India. and Pakistan will inherit trillions of $$$$ worth of military,industrial and educational infrastructure. Secessionist either pretend in their infantile way that this won&rsquo; happen or are willing to sit down and negotiate with the invaders in the handing over of large tracts of American territory to the mortal enemies of Native Born White America. This is full-blown treason.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans can control their destiny. If their is a will, there is way. As soon as Native Born Whites stop internalizing their own oppression, they will start to reclaim America from Mexico,China,India,Pakistan, Korea nd Iran.</p>

			<p>If there&rsquo;s a lesson to be learned in this, it&rsquo;s that blacks and Mexicans can&rsquo;t function well in a capitalist society.  As the nation&rsquo;s population changes, so does the economic system.  So does our form of government.  Free speech is under assault and so is the right to bear arms or own property.  If nonwhites become the majority, is it going to make sense for people to be allowed to own firearms?  1 billion people jammed within the borders of the US will make property ownership unworkable.  </p>

			<p>As a mortgage banking veteran, I can agree that the underwriting guidelines were too &#8220;liberal&#8221;.  While I agree everyone who can afford a home, and knows the responsibilities in owning that home deserves one, the industry rewarded &#8220;bad behavior&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Borrowers with unpaid collections, delinquencies were given credit, and the ole 28/33 ratio guideline was a thing of the past.   Also with the stated income issue, anyone could get a home.  Could they afford it? No.  </p>
<p>What also added to this problem was taking away the deductable interest on credit cards/installment loans.  People began using the homes like ATM&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>We had an artifical bubble created by every tom, dick, and jose being able to get a loan.    However, please bear in mind that many borrower&rsquo;s with Hispanic surnames are legitimate citizens.</p>
<p>What really got me was the different ethnic groups stayed together, many groups were ripped of by loan officers of the same background.   So it wasn&rsquo;t just white loan agents. </p>

<p>First of all where did I say I was a secessionist?  Secondly, how could the borders of the countries you mentioned be extended into the US?  Can you better explain your theory?  If you&rsquo;re referring to the effect of the transmigration of those nationalities coming into this country, I must tell you that such a situation has already occurred and is occurring right now.  It&rsquo;s called multiculturalism and unchecked immigration, and it is already out of control.  </p>
<p>I responded to your post because you kept alluding to someone being &#8220;infantile&#8221; or a &#8220;traitor,&#8221; for offering points on secession, which amounted to nothing more than name calling, and you never gave a single instance as to why your accusations had any merit.   Here&rsquo;s what I said regarding that:</p>
<p>&#8220;To counter propositions of secession you have to lay out credible points indicating the fallacy of it, not hysterically accuse someone of sedition or of being a traitor because he/she has carefully analyzed the situation and determined it is the most practical military tactic to employ at this time.&#8221;<br>

This is full-blown treason.&#8221;</p>
<p>With all due respect, your points don&rsquo;t make sense.  For example, if Oregon and Washington secede from the US and declare themselves an independent nation, how on earth is that going to give any of their assets, infrastructure, equipment, or anything else to another country or their immigrants who will probably be living in other states?</p>
<p>If Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana did the same and declared themselves one nation apart from the US, more likely than not they would be more apt to enact policies that would cause people from the countries you mentioned to leave&hellip;.if they were there at all&hellip;.and relocate to other areas of the US, and if the economy were especially bad it is entirely possible a good many of them would go home. </p>
<p>And, what on earth are you referring to when you write that, &#8220;Secessionists  either pretend in their infantile way that this won&rsquo;t happen or are willing to sit down and negotiate with the invaders in the handing over of large tracts of American territory to the mortal enemies of Native Born White America. This is full-blown treason?&#8221;</p>
<p>Why would secessionists be sitting down and negotiating anything to any invaders&hellip;or group/country for that matter&hellip;.and what on earth do you mean when you write they&rsquo;ll give away large tracts of lands?  How is declaring independence akin to giving anything up, since the inhabitants will be still living there, but just setting up their own government?  And what do you mean when you write that they do things in an &#8220;infantile way?&#8221;  And where, pray tell, does treason come in?</p>
<p>Yes, there was a war for Southern Independece fought, but it wasn&rsquo;t in accord with constitutional precepts.  It was a legal secession.  War began due to naked force by the  northern government disregarding the constitution, because it is more than clear that the founders intended the people to have the right to break from or oust any corrupt government in power.  That&rsquo;s been noted so many times it isn&rsquo;t even arguable.</p>

Have you ever been to the part of this country close to what used to be called the &#8220;Mexican Border?&#8221;  It might as well be Mexico, the only thing American about it are the welfare checks.  It doesn&rsquo;t look like that strong, united military precluded the extension of Mexico into the U.S.</p>
<p>If any secession does happen, it will be of places that aren&rsquo;t America anymore anyway.  If China, Mexico, Pakistan, Korea or Iran want them, fine.  Let the blacks on the southside of Chicago try to whine about civil rights and welfare rights to their government in Beijing, Mexico City, Islamabad, Seoul or Tehran.

<p>As to massive foreign invasion&hellip; umm,where do you live? I am in the Upper Midwest, and we have Somalis and Hispanics in a part of the country NEVER visited by such, until the liberals and the godless got their clamps on our social systems.</p>
<p>Secession? I am ALL FOR IT. Give Whites their own self-aware homeland, and in fifty years, we will have re-conquered the continent- down to Mexico City, like we should have done in the 1800&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>No more &#8220;Mr. Nice White Guy.&#8221; This is a war, and we are just beginning to awaken to the possibility of victory.</p>

<p>You seem to agree that the borders of Mexico,China,Iran,Pakistan and India have already been extended into Amreica to certain extend. It will only get worse over time.</p>
<p>Whether you know it or not, you making my case that Native Born White Americans will give up trillions of dollars worth of military,educational,technological and scientific infrastructure to China,India,Iran,Pakistan.Korea and Iran. Running away from the invasion will bring this state of affairs about-without firing a shot.</p>
<p>It is infantile to think that Native Born White Americans will be safe and secure with the borders of China,India,Pakistan,Iran,India and Korea extending right up to the borders of the White Homeland somewhere in the former United States.</p>
<p>White Nationaliat are suppose to encourage Native Born White Americans to take a stand and fight instead of running away fleeing to a White homelands under the infantile beleif that they will be safe.</p>
<p>Start with this:1)mass deprtation over time of 21 million illegal immigrants2)complete shut down of all non-white legal immigratiom 3) deportation of asian fifth column elements.</p>
<p>Of Course,post 1965 non-whites won&rsquo;t accept any of this. We will have to fight it out with them. The consequences of not getting rid of post-1965 non-whites will result in -over time -the end of Euro-America which is the same thing as the death of America.</p>
<p>Sam Francis was opposed to Secession. Bo Sears is opposed to Secession also.</p>
