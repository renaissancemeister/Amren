<h1>Prosecutors: Afghan Girl Enslaved in Seattle Area</h1>
									<div align="left">

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Five Seattle-area immigrants from Afghanistan enslaved a teenage girl they brought to the U.S., with some forcing her to do chores and one &mdash; her 37-year-old husband &mdash; beating and sexually assaulting her, according to a federal indictment unsealed this week.</p>
<p>The girl is from an impoverished single-parent home in Afghanistan, and she was informally adopted by another family there that forced her to marry at age 13 in 2005, Emily Langlie, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office, said Thursday. The girl&rsquo;s husband is Mohammad Atahee, a friend of the adoptive family; U.S. officials don&rsquo;t recognize the marriage.</p>
<p>Atahee and three of the family&rsquo;s members were already living in the south Seattle suburbs when the girl&rsquo;s adoptive mother, Nasima Yousuf, 70, brought her to the United States in 2006, as part of what prosecutors say was a plot to enslave her. Yousuf&rsquo;s husband, Mohammad, 84, had filed an immigration petition to bring the girl to the U.S., claiming his wife was her biological mother.</p>
<p>Once in the country, the indictment said, the girl, identified only as JV1, was forced to live with Atahee, who beat her and sexually assaulted her. She was forced to spend at least three days a week at the Auburn home of Maruf Yousufi, 42, and his wife, Nahid, 29 &mdash; caring for their children, doing laundry, cooking and cleaning. Maruf Yousufi is Mohammad Yousuf&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All the defendants have legal status in the U.S., Langlie said. The girl, however, does not, because of the Yousufs&rsquo; alleged lies on immigration applications. She could stay in the country by obtaining a visa for victims of human trafficking.<br>

			<p>If you think this story is bad, just wait. If we continue to allow non-whites to move into our country while we steadily decline in population, it wont be long before they start doing this to our children. It&rsquo;s a very slippery slope. I&rsquo;ve read the recent articles on this site about how Britain has now agreed to respect Sharia Law. While for the moment it only applies to Muslims who voluntarily submit to the decisions of these Sharia Courts, how long will it be before they start putting Sharia into the actual legal system. Imagine western women being forced to wear the vale. Imagine having to wake up every morning to the loud &#8220;call to prayer&#8221; being blasted through speakers all over your town. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re heading towards. We allow people from all over the world to come to our country, but then we place the burden of assimilation on ourselves. It&rsquo;s never them that has to learn to be respectful of our ways. It&rsquo;s always us that has to learn to be more tolerant. It&rsquo;s gonna keep getting worse until we take our country back. </p>

<p>In Egypt, christian girls are often kidnapped, beaten, drugged, forcibly converted to Islama and married off to some disgusting lecher.</p>
<p>Because they have &#8220;converted&#8221; to Islam, even under severe duress, the girls are killed if they try to leave Islam. And of course their children are raised muslim, not christian.</p>
<p>It could very well happen here.  And the feminazis would raise no objections, just as they have never raised any objections to black rape of white women.</p>
