<h1><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=76736">White Congressman Shut out of Black Caucus</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WorldNetDaily, October 1, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The policy of the Congressional Black Caucus to restrict its membership based on race for members of that body to decide, according to a spokesman for the White House.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Journalist Lester] Kinsolving asked then asked: &#8220;California&rsquo;s Democratic Congressman Pete Stark risked his life on behalf of civil rights in Mississippi in the 1960s, and because his Oakland district has a large number of blacks, he applied to join the Congressional Black Caucus, but he was turned down because of his skin shade. And my question: Does the president know of any change in this Black Caucus segregation, and if not, does he believe there should be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that the executive respects the right of the legislature to make rules on their own organizational practices,&#8221; Fratto [Deputy Press Secretary Tony Fratto] said.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m always amazed at these black organizations at colleges that don&rsquo;t allow in whites but will throw a fit and get away with it if the shoe&rsquo;s ever on the other foot. And now that we are a minority ourselves in CA, we should be able to do exactly that. What&rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander my 94 year old grandfather says.</p>

			<p>This is 2008 how could this be happening?This sounds like a job for the Dept.of Justice.Oh thats right, they are too busy going after 98 year old white men in cases where all the witnesses died and juries are 100% black.Maybe the time is right for the whites to have their own white congressional group.I thought the government couldn&rsquo;t discriminate.I think congress is a part of the government.The reason they got away with it is because no whites challenged it.The time is now to assert our rights. </p>

			<p>Pete Stark is a looney and no friend of the white man. It is laughable that you can have a black caucus though. Why not a Jewish Caucus, Italian Caucus or English? </p>
<p>How long will we let these people (yes black people) push around the majority? This has to be the only time in history that a people, who have less wealth, less numbers and less intelligence were able to defeat another people. We are losing white people, make no mistake about that.</p>

			<p>Yet the Congressional Black Caucus has no problem using white taxdollars to fund their discriminatory organization.  Any bets that their taxpayer-funded staffs are equally as dark?  Any company that is sued for discrimination in their hiring practices should use the taxpayer-funded CBC as an example of the hypocrisy in the enforcement of EEOC laws.</p>

			<p>I believe the real reason the CBC won&rsquo;t allow white members is because they would then have to modify what they say behind closed doors if a white guy was present.  I can only imagine the ignorance and nonsense spewed when the cameras AREN&rsquo;T on people like Maxine Waters, William Clay, Bobby Rush, Greg Meeks, Carolyn Kilpatrick, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Alcee Hastings.</p>

			<p>Whites are for America and what is good for the country as a whole.</p>
<p>Blacks are concerned with just their race and only their race, and that bias extends to blacks everywhere in the world.  The Black Caucus is but one organization of hundreds that concerns itself with exclusively black welfare and interests.  They not only refuse to support their fellow countrymen, they actively work to cause them harm, hoping they will destruct somehow, so they can step in and take over the country.</p>

			<p>Wheres the FBI investigation into the racist behavior of this identified congress based on race. You know being a supporter of segregation, I some what agree with them. However if your going to push your ugly de-segregation agenda on my people, then you should also de-segregate your self. </p>
<p>The black congress is not just some organization. It is conenected to our government and its members helps promote and pass laws. By this alone this group should be investigated for discrimination and civil rights violations. We really need a white congress like that of the black and Hispanic congresses. All we need is one pro-white member of congress in the congress to start it. </p>
<p>This group is a hypocritical racist bunch of bigots. Don&rsquo;t believe me look at some of the things they helped get passed.</p>

			<p>Yes Wyatt, Im serious. Not may people have ever heard of those gropups., they also probably except members who are not of that nationality.</p>
<p>I would also add except for the Asian and Hispanic Caucus, those other ones are about nationality, not race. Hispanics can also be of any race. The black causcus is about one race only.</p>
<p>Are you going to tell me that a Congressional White Caucus would be allowed. If you say yes then you are lying or very naive.</p>

			<p>Yes, Wyatt Im serious. Most of those HUGE groups you mentioned are about nationality, not race. Secondly, do they limit their membership, like the black caucus. Thirdly, the black caucus is about one race only.</p>
<p>The million dollar question is, why is there no white caucus? Anyone who is honest knows it would never be allowed. In fact, for white people to even think of themselves as a group is called racism. This site is attacked because it dares to advocate for white people.</p>

			<p>Wyatt Phillips thats nice. But there is no caucus that represents white Americans. You see there is a Brazil caucus, Caucus on Central America, Gulf of Mexico Caucus and then there is a Hispanic-American Caucus. </p>
<p>There is a Caucus on Uganda and Caribbean Caucus and then there is a Black Caucus for African Americans.</p>
<p>There is a French Caucus, Czech Caucus, Croatian Caucus but there is no White America caucus. </p>
<p>So you get what I am saying there is a caucus the represents Hiapanic and Black Americans, but no caucus that represents White Americans.</p>

			<p>If diversity is our strength; and, if political correctness, is the cornerstone of diversity; and, if diversity originates and is disseminated from Congress; then, why isn&rsquo;t it slightly inconsistent that Congress has caucuses that aren&rsquo;t diverse?</p>
<p>But since I am neither politically correct nor a diversity proponent I have no problem with blacks wanting to be together. In fact, I wish that they would all, always want to be together, exclusively with their own kind.   </p>
<p>In my view, there is a direct correlation between blacks as a group getting the right to vote and the decline of this country socially. Think not? Well would we have had this mortgage melt down but for the politically correct bilge being force fed us   by our elected officials pandering to black action committees?    </p>
<p>This country would be much better off if there were no blacks in Congress and governments in general; consequently, were that the case, this would not be an issue.  </p>
<p>Outside of a professional sports team I can not think of one reason to ever have a black in any organization. When a race can&rsquo;t govern itself it should never be placed in a position of power over others. But the white man had to give the right to vote to the black man. Why? </p>
<p>And, when the issue is politically correct toleration, this hypocritical construct, the black caucus, by its very existence, proves its founders to be the liars that we  have all come to expect. Does anyone in his or her right mind think that this would not be a better country in every way if the population were one hundred percent WHITE?</p>
<p>If I had ever known this would be the way it would have all turned out I would have picked my own damn cotton!</p>

			<p>I just wonder if there is a single legally enforcable and definitive test for declaring oneself as being &#8216;black&rsquo; in America. It can&rsquo;t simply be skin colour as this is racist and, in any case, there are many shades and hues. How about africans who use skin whitener chemicals? Could being black be defined by DNA or IQ? Hitler insisted that individuals should prove their racial purity by documentation over several generations. RSA had race officially classified under aparthied. Just suppose I visited USA and insisted that I am black, how could my claim be contested unless I failed a &#8216;blackness&rsquo; examination and therefore had to be classed under some other profile. How could I be refused entry into this &#8216;black caucus&rsquo; if I attempted to join? Could I sue them for zillions unless they could prove I am not black and not &#8216;qualified&rsquo; and could I insist that every current member undergo exactly the same probity? I don&rsquo;t think I would have anything to lose and could even gain a bit of paper stating I am not black. I bet not many White people have one of those. I could even gain a listing in &#8216;Wikipedia&rsquo;! Just a thought though, suppose I actually passed the test? </p>

			<p>The CBC is a very powerful group, majority of the time voting as a bloc, often using accusations of racism to intimidate other members of congress, as a voting bloc they are high on the dole for pork projects, there is a huge connection between the CBC and the scandals w/fannie mae and freddie mac. Investigate them? I don&rsquo;t think so, it would kill the career of any politican who even hinted at it.</p>

			<p>In response to Ron&rsquo;s question&#8221;What good would that do&#8221; in response to having a white congressional group.I think we have alot of issues that need to be brought out and have the national spotlight shined upon.But when was the last time anyone in the media or at the national level raised any of our issues posted on this web site.If our congress people assert our rights at that level it would encourage leadership at the lower levels to do the same.A srong white community makes for a srong America.</p>

			<p>The Black Caucus idea is a lot like &#8220;vote for Obama to PROVE you&rsquo;re not a racist.&#8221; That if Obama gets defeated (as he should), it is ONLY due to White racism   &mdash;   that the policies and &#8220;change&#8221; Obama represents not being seen as practical have nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Yes, Friends. You should NOT perceive and vote for McCain as being &#8220;the lesser of two evils.&#8221; That&rsquo;s blatant racism, according to Blacks. But for Blacks to vote for Obama and reject McCain   &mdash;   that is emphatically NOT racism. Now could someone explain that &#8220;logic&#8221; to me.</p>

			<p>Come on, now.  Do you honestly care what the Black respresentatives do behind closed doors?  I don&rsquo;t.  They&rsquo;re probably arguing over who gets to use Charles Rangel&rsquo;s time-share next, or who gets to sleep in the Lincoln bedroom first if Obama gets elected, or who gets to unveil a bronze statue of Twana Brawley.  Yawn.</p>
<p>All you have to do is Youtube government meetings in Africa to see what a joke it is.  Many of them end up in full-on brawls.  Let them sit around and complain about &#8216;racism&rsquo; and more welfare.  It&rsquo;s never gotten them anywhere, and it never will.</p>

			<p>The ultimate irony and hypocrisy here is that the Congressman who tried to attend the meeting, Steve Cohen, is Jewish.   Lest the Black Caucus members forget, a large number of Jewish activists were involved in organizing the Civil Rights Movement for the benefit of Blacks.  </p>
<p>In 1964, two of the three activists in Mississippi who were murdered were Jewish.  The NAACP was formed by Jewish activists to help promote Black rights and interests.  We would not know the names of Rosa Parks or Martin Luther King had it not been for the dedication of these activists to the cause, of which Jewish Americans are very proud.</p>
<p>After all this, isn&rsquo;t ironic that they shut the door in Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s face?  I&rsquo;m sure that the large Black constituency in Memphis which Mr. Cohen represents isn&rsquo;t complaining that he instituted the State Lottery program so that they can gamble away their welfare checks instead of getting real jobs.  My, how times have changed.</p>

			<p>Wyatt, those are not restricted to members of Congress who are of the specified ethnicity.  If they were, most of them would be pretty lonely.  As far as I know, the Black Caucus is the only one which specifically restricts its membership to blacks, although I would not be surprised if the Hispanic one and maybe the Asian one do.  The rest of them, however, are basically special interest groups dedicated to furthering the goals of whatever nation they are focused around.  The Armenian one is perhaps the most famous because recently they tried to push a bill through Congress that would have required America to publically make a statement denouncing Turkey for its denial of the Armenian genocide; this was at the height of the diplomatic crisis between America and Turkey over Turkey&rsquo;s role in the Iraq war.  The bill never made it to the floor.  </p>

<p>Remember that Jesse Jackson got caught calling Jews &#8220;hymies&#8221; by a black reporter who secretly taped their conversation. Apparently, Jesse found the only black reporter in America who put doing his job over racial loyalty.</p>
<p>Maybe there is an enterprising black reporter who could do the same to the CBC. Can you imagine the anti-white ramblings and conspiracy theories that come out of those meetings?</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget the philosophy behind this black caucus stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about economic equality anymore [supposidely because they are racist]. It&rsquo;s about racist black nationalism. If white caucuses are not allowed in a democracy, then neither should these black caucuses be permitted at all given their racist message.</p>
<p>For example, Obama drank in this &#8220;spiritual&#8221; message for 20 years nodding, agreeing, and applauding Wright then gave a 20 minute disassociation speech which means next to nothing compared to those 20 years of firm support and agreement with the message of racist black nationalism. Rev Wright&rsquo;s spiritual father James Cone penned and taught the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Theology refuses to accept a God who is not identified totally with the goals of the black community. If God is not for us and against white people, then he is a murderer, and we better kill him&hellip; The task of black theology is to kill Gods who do not belong to the black community. Black theology will accept only the love of God which participates in the destruction of the white enemy. What we need is the divine love as expressed in black power, which is the power of black people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal&hellip; unless God is participating in this holy activity, we must reject his love.&#8221; James cone Ph.D. &#8216;Black Power and Black Theology&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There are some very stupid ignorant white liberals that will eventually be sorry they put this into practice in our country when Obama becomes President. </p>

			<p>The CBC is telling us race matters, black interests come first, and they don&rsquo;t care what white people think.  If only we were allowed our own caucus or organizations to advance our interests then I wouldn&rsquo;t be so resentful by this show of black racial arrogance and solidarity.  The organizations we do have are not recognized by any level of government, aren&rsquo;t lavishly funded by any foundation, and are ceaselessly attacked and marginalized by the so called mainstream media.  </p>
<p>All of the white people who risked everything for blacks during the civil rights era are just useful idiots who the blacks despise as much as they would any klansmen or nazi.  They certainly are not being fondly remembered by blacks, for they are too white to be accorded any place in the pantheon of black history since 1965.  </p>
<p>White do gooding on behalf of ungrateful blacks has gained us nothing but their eternal enmity.  </p>
