<h1>Latin Gangs Rule Spain&rsquo;s Streets</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sinikka Tarvainen, Monsters and Critics, October 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They call themselves kings and queens. They rule over streets they have named the Inca, Aztec or Hispanic kingdom. They believe in God, honour and brotherhood. And whoever breaks the code of silence, does so at his own risk.</p>
<p>The Latin Kings are the best-known among the Hispanic youth gangs that have formed in Spain among the immigrants from its former colonies.</p>
<p>Gradually, Spanish police experts are beginning to understand the mentality of the street gangs born or based on models in poor and crime-infested neighbourhoods in the Americas.</p>
<p>The Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation was initially formed to help and defend Latin American immigrants in the Chicago area of the United States in the 1940s. Its members later became involved in violent crimes.</p>
<p>The Spanish branch of the Latin Kings was launched in 2000 by the young Ecuadorian Eric Velastegui, known as King Wolverine, who is now serving a prison sentence for rape.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other gangs include Dominican Don&rsquo;t Play (DDP), many of whose members come from the Dominican Republic. The Madrid DDP has begun to sell drugs and acquired firearms, the daily El Pais reported.</p>
<p>Recently, evidence has even emerged of the presence in Catalonia of the Mara Salvatrucha and the Mara 18, Central American groups known for their extreme violence.</p>
<p>In the Madrid region alone, the number of gang members tripled in three years to about 1,300 by 2007, police estimated. Nearly 300 of them were regarded as violent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The overall number of immigrants has soared from 1.8 per cent of the Spanish population in 1990 to more than 10 per cent. The largest groups include 420,000 Ecuadorians and 260,000 Colombians.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Immigrants never see their children, because they work 23 hours a day. The kids are on the street, in search of a (new) family,&rsquo; King Mission, a US representative of the Latin Kings, explained during a visit to Spain.</p>

			<p>This is a great example of why we should use the term &#8220;mestizo&#8221;, instead of hispanic.  Just because mestizos speak Spanish they are not European Spanish, anymore than a black who speaks English is White.  They are not us and they know it.  Whites are the ones who pretend they are not the other and ignore the fact that they mean us harm.</p>

			<p>You left out the punchline from the article:<br>
<br><br>
<i>While the conservative Madrid authorities outlawed the Latin Kings in 2007, liberal Catalonia took the opposite approach, giving them the status of a cultural association. </i></p>
<p>Representatives of the Latin Kings and Netas even visited the regional parliament, explaining to legislators that they were planning to make joint musical recordings to bury their hostilities. </p>
<p>International experts on street gangs have hailed Catalonia&rsquo;s ground-breaking approach, but it has not entirely eradicated inter-gang violence.  <br></p>
<p>not entirely, eh??<br>

<p>If that&rsquo;s really the case, these parents are neglectful and have all but abandoned their children.  In that case, the Spanish government should step in and take custody of them, then arrange for their home countries to receive them and take them into foster care.  Surely it&rsquo;s better for the children than a life lived on the streets, abandoned and uncared for.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s hogwash, of course.  These primitives form gangs because they&rsquo;re still very close to their tribal lives in the jungles of Central and South America.  Gangs are no more than tribes and tribes have been their family units for thousands of years.  They haven&rsquo;t evolved enough to cast off their old ways.</p>
<p>Not long ago Spaniards got fed up with the crime and violence by these people and went on a rampaging riot against them.  Hopefully there will be more of the same now that the Spanish economy is collapsing right along with the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>The Western world&rsquo;s only hope to shake these parasitic fleas from their homelands is for their economies to offer zero benefits and jobs for them, so they will go back home.  Those that elect to stay and fight in the civil upheavals will likely wish they had left with the others.</p>

<p>Spain went through a terrible Civil War during the 20th century; it&rsquo;s memory in Spain is still vivid. They don&rsquo;t want another.<br>
As for fighting, what Spaniards will be left to fight back, except the elderly, up against a swarm of youthful, aggressive invaders?  Of course, the same will be true in almost all of Europe.<br>

			<p>Wow, this is really bad news. Mestizos and mulattos form street gangs everywhere they go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not stated in the story, but I assume that native White Spaniards form few, if any, street gangs?</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t get this? Why don&rsquo;t Whites form nasty and violent street gangs? They don&rsquo;t form them in the US and they don&rsquo;t form them in Europe (except S Italy and Albania). Yet everywhere they go, Hispanics, Blacks and Polynesians form gangs.</p>

			<p>Southern Italians and Albanians form crime syndicates, not &#8216;street gangs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are things like &#8216;gangs&rsquo; of large numbers of white Europeans (the English hooligans? very loose, but still), but they don&rsquo;t seem to take it as seriously as mestizoes, who seem to revel in their gang identities and wish to pass them onto their offspring.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to look further than basically untilligent, rootless people who are failures by the standards of the societies they live in forming a counter-culture that disdain education and glorify the most destructive aspects of machismo.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the receiving countries, repatriation of gang members to their homelands should be the foremost priority.  Sadly, even in their homelands, these people tend to come from the lowest racial stripes and thus feel almost equally alienated as they do in countries they emigrate to.  Solutions then should be: paying them to voluntarily sterilize themselves, rationalizing the policy as a &#8220;population stabilization&#8221; measure, perhaps; instituting sliding scale of financial &#8216;rewards&rsquo; for staying out of trouble and learning (simple) job and/or homemaking skills (simple being the operative word); greatly enhanced law enforcement, targeting gangs and the strains of society they are most likely to emerge from, &#8216;profiling&rsquo; be damned.  As a last resort, death squads   &mdash;   and I&rsquo;m serious.</p>

</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a consequence of multiracialism.  Some races are more advanced than others.  The races on the bottom run of multiracial societies, when are they are as stupid as blacks and hispanic mestizoes, are unable to find positive outlets for the social and economic alienation they experience.  Multiracial societies like Malaysia or Singapore don&rsquo;t experience this because the lowest racial stripes there are not as stupid as blacks and hispanics.  (SE. Asian culture probably doesn&rsquo;t make it a point to glorify gang-like degeneracy in films and music, which presumably also helps.)</p>

<p>Speaking for America, whites do indeed form street gangs; only they are called Militias.  Militias are comprised primarily of combat vets and hunters.  No street gang on American soil would last more than ten seconds if targeted by a contingent of Militia members.</p>
<p>And the whites who are not Militia members would act as individuals or in groups of two or three.  Ambushes and assassinations would be the order of the days and these minority street gangs would fall like dead trees in a hurricane.   <br>

			<p>My guess is most of these people have no idea who their father is so they form groups (gangs) so as not to be killing their biological brother or sister? But if you think about it whites have gangs too, they just call themselves lawyers, judges or politicians. Look what they have done to us recently and to make it worse they spit in our eye and laugh in our face if we have the audacity to even question their Supreme Authority over US the little people as they love to call us..</p>

<p><br>
We once were a model for the world, looked up to and admired. Now, we&rsquo;re feared, resented and hated.  Nowadays, we export rap, ebonics, violence and vulgarity, dirty dancing, filthy language, pornography, feminism, race mixing, white guilt,  black supremacy, irresponsible wasting of resources, etc.   And if anybody doesn&rsquo;t desire this new &#8220;American Way of Life&#8221;, we&rsquo;ll invade them, bomb them, and MAKE them learn to like it.  After all, G-d is on our side   &mdash;   he personally TOLD our president so, so we know we&rsquo;re right.</p>

<p>The number of non-whites in Spanish society is quickly approaching the point of no return, after which it will be impossible to remove these people from the country without some kind of violent conflict. </p>

<p>Nobody wants a civil war, but nobody really backs away from one either if the cause is right.  If your theory were right regarding being fed up with war, we wouldn&rsquo;t have had many in the history of mankind.  Men like to fight, and they will fight if all other means have been exhausted to achieve justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for fighting, what Spaniards will be left to fight back, except the elderly, up against a swarm of youthful, aggressive invaders? Of course, the same will be true in almost all of Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heh, heh, heh.  All they have are elderly people in Spain, eh?  and the rest of Europe?  LOL.   Absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p>If this present economic plummet develops into a meltdown, the entire Western world will be embroiled in civil upheavals, and most of the third world rabble will be annihilated or forced to leave.</p>
<p>To consider anything else is to admit a complete lack of knowledge in military strategy and tactics.<br>

			<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it a Spanish philosopher or general that said &#8220;those who don&rsquo;t know their history are doomed to repeat it&#8221;.</p>
<p>What a mess Spain(also Portugal) made in the past by not making sure that all colonizers of the new world brought in families so they wouldn&rsquo;t mix with the Indians and blacks. </p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re bringing these mixed low IQ descendants of bastards  to Spain to run around and ruin everything.</p>
<p>South America would of been really something else if they only kept or really enforced rules of not mixing. Or somewhat have copied what north America did as far keeping together as a race(not anymore though) and as states.</p>
<p>Kick them out or head to a sure path of civil war. </p>

<p>What, you don&rsquo;t watch A&E;, and don&rsquo;t know about the ultra-dangerous Skinheads?  Why, according to that channel, Skinheads have committed a dozen murders in the past 3 years.  They have special organizations like the SPLC and ADL to watch out for their evil actions.  Then, the next night, you hear about the poor, misunderstood MS-13, which has committed thousands of murders and rapes, and, unfortunately, lacks a nation-wide group to track its doings.<br>

Yes, the only reason such alien gangs exist on our soil is because we (that is, our authorities) tolerate them, not because they are so tough or because they have &#8220;won&#8221; anything from us. It&rsquo;s easy for them to think they&rsquo;re tough guys and &#8220;winners&#8221; when no one is fighting back.  (No one is allowed to.)<br>

&#8220;Heh, heh, heh. All they have are elderly people in Spain, eh? and the rest of Europe? LOL. Absolutely hilarious.&#8221;<br>

Dear Ranger:  You and another poster have misread me. I never said (or meant to imply) that &#8220;we should just pack in in and give up&#8221;.  Never!  And I never meant to suggest that Spain should not fight back and evict the invaders. Please read more carefully!  I didn&rsquo;t say &#8220;all they HAVE [present tense] are elderly people&#8221;.  What I said was that IN THE FUTURE there <i>&#8220;WILL BE&#8221;  </i>many more elderly people in Spain (and Europe) than now, therefore the time to do something is obviously NOW, as soon as possible.  The longer they wait, the worse the situation will become.  Who is advocating surrender?  Absolutely not I.  To the contrary.  Your misconstrual of my message is what&rsquo;s &#8220;hilarious&#8221;!<br>
 <br>
And in saying that Spain went through a ruinous civil war in the 30s   &mdash;   within the memory of many <i> people still living </i>  &mdash;    I was trying to EXPLAIN WHY the Spanish are reluctant to take up arms and face civil violence once again   &mdash;   but NOT arguing that they should not be willing to do so.  They are also enjoying a level of prosperity that they have never known before  (Spain was very poor until recently), and many are also reluctant to risk losing that. I&rsquo;m not saying they shouldn&rsquo;t, but this is just how it is   &mdash;   just the same thing as with us.<br>

			<p>Browser:  Sooner or later one of these gangs will step over the line and be obliterated.  The other gangs will then fade into the shadows never to be see again.  MS-13&rsquo;s pants wetting reaction to Sombra Negra in EL Salvidore proves this beyond a doubt&hellip;</p>

			<p>  Boy, does this make late Leonard Bernstein&rsquo;s West Side Story seem dated. The &#8220;white&#8221; gang (Jets) in the musical has a Jew, Italian, Pole, almost every white ethnic group in New York City, while the Puerto Rican gang (Sharks) is all Puerto Rican  &mdash;   except for the miscast but beautiful Ukrainian, Natalie Wood. This is like all whites on deck against Hispanics? It isn&rsquo;t just Puerto Ricans anymore. Hey, the music is still good anyway.</p>
