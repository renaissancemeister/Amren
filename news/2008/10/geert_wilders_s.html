<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for inviting me. Great to be at the Four Seasons. I come from a country that has one season only: a rainy season that starts January 1st and ends December 31st. When we have three sunny days in a row, the government declares a national emergency. So Four Seasons, that&rsquo;s new to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to be in New York. When I see the skyscrapers and office buildings, I think of what Ayn Rand said: &#8220;The sky over New York and the will of man made visible.&#8221; Of course. Without the Dutch you would have been nowhere, still figuring out how to buy this island from the Indians. But we are glad we did it for you. And, frankly, you did a far better job than we possibly could have done.</p>
<p>I come to America with a mission. All is not well in the old world. There is a tremendous danger looming, and it is very difficult to be optimistic. We might be in the final stages of the Islamization of Europe. This not only is a clear and present danger to the future of Europe itself, it is a threat to America and the sheer survival of the West. The danger I see looming is the scenario of America as the last man standing. The United States as the last bastion of Western civilization, facing an Islamic Europe. In a generation or two, the US will ask itself: who lost Europe? Patriots from around Europe risk their lives every day to prevent precisely this scenario form becoming a reality.</p>
<p>My short lecture consists of 4 parts.</p>
<p>First I will describe the situation on the ground in Europe. Then, I will say a few things about Islam. Thirdly, if you are still here, I will talk a little bit about the movie you just saw. To close I will tell you about a meeting in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Europe you know is changing. You have probably seen the landmarks. The Eiffel Tower and Trafalgar Square and Rome&rsquo;s ancient buildings and maybe the canals of Amsterdam. They are still there. And they still look very much the same as they did a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>But in all of these cities, sometimes a few blocks away from your tourist destination, there is another world, a world very few visitors see &mdash; and one that does not appear in your tourist guidebook. It is the world of the parallel society created by Muslim mass-migration. All throughout Europe a new reality is rising: entire Muslim neighbourhoods where very few indigenous people reside or are even seen. And if they are, they might regret it. This goes for the police as well. It&rsquo;s the world of head scarves, where women walk around in figureless tents, with baby strollers and a group of children. Their husbands, or slaveholders if you prefer, walk three steps ahead. With mosques on many street corner. The shops have signs you and I cannot read. You will be hard-pressed to find any economic activity. These are Muslim ghettos controlled by religious fanatics. These are Muslim neighbourhoods, and they are mushrooming in every city across Europe. These are the building-blocks for territorial control of increasingly larger portions of Europe, street by street, neighbourhood by neighbourhood, city by city.</p>
<p>There are now thousands of mosques throughout Europe. With larger congregations than there are in churches. And in every European city there are plans to build super-mosques that will dwarf every church in the region. Clearly, the signal is: we rule.</p>
<p>Many European cities are already one-quarter Muslim: just take Amsterdam, Marseille and Malmo in Sweden. In many cities the majority of the under-18 population is Muslim. Paris is now surrounded by a ring of Muslim neighbourhoods. Mohammed is the most popular name among boys in many cities. In some elementary schools in Amsterdam the farm can no longer be mentioned, because that would also mean mentioning the pig, and that would be an insult to Muslims. Many state schools in Belgium and Denmark only serve halal food to all pupils.  In once-tolerant Amsterdam gays are beaten up almost exclusively by Muslims. Non-Muslim women routinely hear &#8220;whore, whore&#8221;. Satellite dishes are not pointed to local TV stations, but to stations in the country of origin.  In France school teachers are advised to avoid authors deemed offensive to Muslims, including Voltaire and Diderot; the same is increasingly true of Darwin. The history of the Holocaust can in many cases no longer be taught because of Muslim sensitivity.  In England sharia courts are now officially part of the British legal system. Many neighbourhoods in France are no-go areas for women without head scarves.  Last week a man almost died after being beaten up by Muslims in Brussels, because he was drinking during the Ramadan. Jews are fleeing France in record numbers, on the run for the worst wave of anti-Semitism since World War II. French is now commonly spoken on the streets of Tel Aviv and Netanya, Israel. I could go on forever with stories like this. Stories about Islamization.</p>
<p>A total of fifty-four million Muslims now live in Europe. San Diego University recently calculated that a staggering 25 percent of the population in Europe will be Muslim just 12 years from now. Bernhard Lewis has predicted a Muslim majority by the end of this century.</p>
<p>Now these are just numbers. And the numbers would not be threatening if the Muslim-immigrants had a strong desire to assimilate. But there are few signs of that. The Pew Research Center reported that half of French Muslims see their loyalty to Islam as greater than their loyalty to France. One-third of French Muslims do not object to suicide attacks. The British Centre for Social Cohesion reported that one-third of British Muslim students are in favour of a worldwide caliphate. A Dutch study reported that half of Dutch Muslims admit they &#8220;understand&#8221; the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>Muslims demand what they call &lsquo;respect&rsquo;. And this is how we give them respect. Our elites are willing to give in. To give up. In my own country we have gone from calls by one cabinet member to turn Muslim holidays into official state holidays, to statements by another cabinet member, that Islam is part of Dutch culture, to an affirmation by the Christian-Democratic attorney general that he is willing to accept sharia in the Netherlands if there is a Muslim majority. We have cabinet members with passports from Morocco and Turkey.</p>
<p>Muslim demands are supported by unlawful behaviour, ranging from petty crimes and random violence, for example against ambulance workers and bus drivers, to small-scale riots. Paris has seen its uprising in the low-income suburbs, the banlieus. Some prefer to see these as isolated incidents, but I call it a Muslim intifada. I call the perpetrators &#8220;settlers&#8221;. Because that is what they are. They do not come to integrate into our societies, they come to integrate our society into their Dar-al-Islam. Therefore, they are settlers.</p>
<p>Much of this street violence I mentioned is directed exclusively against non-Muslims, forcing many native people to leave their neighbourhoods, their cities, their countries.</p>
<p>Politicians shy away from taking a stand against this creeping sharia. They believe in the equality of all cultures. Moreover, on a mundane level, Muslims are now a swing vote not to be ignored.</p>
<p>Our many problems with Islam cannot be explained by poverty, repression or the European colonial past, as the Left claims. Nor does it have anything to do with Palestinians or American troops in Iraq. The problem is Islam itself.</p>
<p>Allow me to give you a brief Islam 101. The first thing you need to know about Islam is the importance of the book of the Quran. The Quran is Allah&rsquo;s personal word, revealed by an angel to Mohammed, the prophet. This is where the trouble starts. Every word in the Quran is Allah&rsquo;s word and therefore not open to discussion or interpretation. It is valid for every Muslim and for all times. Therefore, there is no such a thing as moderate Islam. Sure, there are a lot of moderate Muslims. But a moderate Islam is non-existent.</p>
<p>The Quran calls for hatred, violence, submission, murder, and terrorism. The Quran calls for Muslims to kill non-Muslims, to terrorize non-Muslims and to fulfil their duty to wage war: violent jihad. Jihad is a duty for every Muslim, Islam is to rule the world &mdash; by the sword. The  Quran is clearly anti-Semitic, describing Jews as monkeys and pigs.</p>
<p>The second thing you need to know is the importance of Mohammed the prophet. His behaviour is an example to all Muslims and cannot be criticized. Now, if Mohammed had been a man of peace, let us say like Ghandi and Mother Theresa wrapped in one, there would be no problem. But Mohammed was a warlord, a mass murderer, a pedophile, and had several marriages &mdash; at the same time. Islamic tradition tells us how he fought in battles, how he had his enemies murdered and even had prisoners of war executed. Mohammed himself slaughtered the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza. He advised on matters of slavery, but never advised to liberate slaves. Islam has no other morality than the advancement of Islam. If it is good for Islam, it is good. If it is bad for Islam, it is bad. There is no gray area or other side.</p>
<p>Quran as Allah&rsquo;s own word and Mohammed as the perfect man are the two most important facets of Islam. Let no one fool you about Islam being a religion. Sure, it has a god, and a here-after, and 72 virgins. But in its essence Islam is a political ideology. It is a system that lays down detailed rules for society and the life of every person. Islam wants to dictate every aspect of life. Islam means &lsquo;submission&rsquo;. Islam is not compatible with freedom and democracy, because what it strives for is sharia. If you want to compare Islam to anything, compare it to communism or national-socialism, these are all totalitarian ideologies.</p>
<p>This is what you need to know about Islam, in order to understand what is going on in Europe. For millions of Muslims the Quran and the live of Mohammed are not 14 centuries old, but are an everyday reality, an ideal, that guide every aspect of their lives. Now you know why Winston Churchill called Islam &#8220;the most retrograde force in the world&#8221;, and why he compared Mein Kampf to the Quran.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my movie, Fitna.</p>
<p>I am a lawmaker, and not a movie maker. But I felt I had the moral duty to educate about Islam. The duty to make clear that the Quran stands at the heart of what some people call terrorism but is in reality jihad. I wanted to show that the problems of Islam are at the core of Islam, and do not belong to its fringes.</p>
<p>Now, from the day the plan for my movie was made public, it caused quite a stir, in the Netherlands and throughout Europe. First, there was a political storm, with government leaders, across the continent in sheer panic. The Netherlands was put under a heightened terror alert, because of possible attacks or a revolt by our Muslim population. The Dutch branch of the Islamic organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir declared that the Netherlands was due for an attack. Internationally, there was a series of incidents. The Taliban threatened to organize additional attacks against Dutch troops in Afghanistan, and a website linked to Al Qaeda published the message that I ought to be killed, while various muftis in the Middle East stated that I would be responsible for all the bloodshed after the screening of the movie. In Afghanistan and Pakistan the Dutch flag was burned on several occasions. Dolls representing me were also burned. The Indonesian President announced that I will never be admitted into Indonesia again, while the UN Secretary General and the European Union issued cowardly statements in the same vein as those made by the Dutch Government. I could go on and on. It was an absolute disgrace, a sell-out.</p>
<p>A plethora of legal troubles also followed, and have not ended yet. Currently the state of Jordan is litigating against me. Only last week there were renewed security agency reports about a heightened terror alert for the Netherlands because of Fitna.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is very difficult to be an optimist in the face of the growing Islamization of Europe. All the tides are against us. On all fronts we are losing. Demographically the momentum is with Islam. Muslim immigration is even a source of pride within ruling liberal parties. Academia, the arts, the media, trade unions, the churches, the business world, the entire political establishment have all converted to the suicidal theory of multiculturalism. So-called journalists volunteer to label any and all critics of Islamization as a &lsquo;right-wing extremists&rsquo; or &lsquo;racists&rsquo;. The entire establishment has sided with our enemy. Leftists, liberals and Christian-Democrats are now all in bed with Islam.</p>
<p>This is the most painful thing to see: the betrayal by our elites. At this moment in Europe&rsquo;s history, our elites are supposed to lead us. To stand up for centuries of civilization. To defend our heritage.  To honour our eternal Judeo-Christian values that made Europe what it is today. But there are very few signs of hope to be seen at the governmental level. Sarkozy, Merkel, Brown, Berlusconi; in private, they probably know how grave the situation is. But when the little red light goes on, they stare into the camera and tell us that Islam is a religion of peace, and we should all try to get along nicely and sing Kumbaya. They willingly participate in, what President Reagan so aptly called: &#8220;the betrayal of our past, the squandering of our freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>If there is hope in Europe, it comes from the people, not from the elites. Change can only come from a grass-roots level. It has to come from the citizens themselves. Yet these patriots will have to take on the entire political, legal and media establishment.</p>
<p>Over the past years there have been some small, but encouraging, signs of a rebirth of the original European spirit. Maybe the elites turn their backs on freedom, the public does not. In my country, the Netherlands, 60 percent of the population now sees the mass immigration of Muslims as the number one policy mistake since World War II. And another 60 percent sees Islam as the biggest threat to our national identity. I don&rsquo;t think the public opinion in Holland is very different from other European countries.</p>
<p>Patriotic parties that oppose jihad are growing, against all odds. My own party debuted two years ago, with five percent of the vote. Now it stands at ten percent in the polls. The same is true of all smililary-minded parties in Europe. They are fighting the liberal establishment, and are gaining footholds on the political arena, one voter at the time.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time, these patriotic parties will come together and exchange experiences. It may be the start of something big. Something that might change the map of Europe for decades to come. It might also be Europe&rsquo;s last chance.</p>
<p>This December a conference will take place in Jerusalem. Thanks to Professor Aryeh Eldad, a member of Knesset, we will be able to watch Fitna in the Knesset building and discuss the jihad. {snip}</p>
<p>This conference will be the start of an Alliance of European patriots. This Alliance will serve as the backbone for all organizations and political parties that oppose jihad and Islamization. For this Alliance I seek your support.</p>
<p>This endeavor may be crucial to America and to the West. America may hold fast to the dream that, thanks tot its location, it is safe from jihad and shaira. But seven years ago to the day, there was still smoke rising from ground zero, following the attacks that forever shattered that dream. Yet there is a danger even greater danger than terrorist attacks, the scenario of America as the last man standing. The lights may go out in Europe faster than you can imagine. An Islamic Europe means a Europe without freedom and democracy, an economic wasteland, an intellectual nightmare, and a loss of military might for America &mdash; as its allies will turn into enemies, enemies with atomic bombs. With an Islamic Europe, it would be up to America alone to preserve the heritage of Rome, Athens and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Dear friends, liberty is the most precious of gifts. My generation never had to fight for this freedom, it was offered to us on a silver platter, by people who fought for it with their lives. All throughout Europe American cemeteries remind us of the young boys who never made it home, and whose memory we cherish. My generation does not own this freedom; we are merely its custodians. We can only hand over this hard won liberty to Europe&rsquo;s children in the same state in which it was offered to us. We cannot strike a deal with mullahs and imams. Future generations would never forgive us. We cannot squander our liberties. We simply do not have the right to do so.</p>
<p>This is not the first time our civilization is under threat. We have seen dangers before. We have been betrayed by our elites before. They have sided with our enemies before. And yet,  then, freedom prevailed.</p>
<p>These are not times in which to take lessons from appeasement, capitulation, giving away,  giving up or giving in. These are not times in which to draw lessons from Mr. Chamberlain. These are times calling us to draw lessons from Mr. Churchill and the words he spoke in 1942:</p>
<p>&#8220;Never give in, never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy&#8221;.<br>

			<p>  How right Geert Wilders is when he says multiculturalism is national suicide for the West. But also like he says, there are signs of hope. The victories by two nationalist parties in the recent Austrian elections are a good example. Maybe, just maybe, Europe is waking up in time to save itself from oblivion. Now if we in the U.S. could say that we have become aware of the similar dangers we are facing!</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt the threat of Islam to Europe but is it possible it&rsquo;s being exaggerated a bit?  Fifty-four million muslims?  Maybe if you count the populations living in the Balkans region but in Western Europe there are about 18 million.  That bit about America being the last man standing is laughable.  Maybe we don&rsquo;t have alot of muslims but we have plenty of blacks and Mexicans and an endless supply of third world immigration that will run America into the ground in alot less time than Europe will be conquered by muslims.  America is 62% European, Europe is 5% muslim.  I pray that America still survives in some form but Europe still has it&rsquo;s own destiny in it&rsquo;s own hands.  Don&rsquo;t give into these muslims demands.  If they commit a crime, deport them.  Pass laws making it their lives in Europe uncomfortable.  Put pork vendors out on the streets.  Hang crucifixes in the classrooms.  Make it against the law to wear hajibs, burkhas and headscarfs in public arenas.  I guarantee if you adopt these measures and plenty more like them their populations will dry up in no time.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s worse than I thought.  What the hell is wrong with white people?  I don&rsquo;t get it?  They &#8220;claim&#8221; they love their countries, their culture, their children, and their motherlands yet they sit silently as others take over everything and dictate thought.  I rarely meet anyone willing to voice dissent to the elitist policies.  Our politicians are willing to sacrifice everything for a few &#8220;temporary&#8221; votes.  I don&rsquo;t get it?  Could someone please educate this angry but clueless imbecile?<br>

			<p>Geert WIlders, Theo Van Gogh, Pym Fortyn and other Dutch patriots have shown us the way. They are brave and also not, stupid idiots. They don&rsquo;t waste all their time and money trying to elect no hope, raceless, culture-less libertarian constitutionalists President and ignore the Muslim invasions.</p>
<p>Opposing the Muslim immigration Muslim invasions works. White Westerners all over the world can understand who is &#8220;us&#8221; and who is &#8220;them&#8221;.</p>
<p>Time to organize &#8220;us&#8221; to oppose the invasion, conquest and enslavement by &#8220;them&#8221;.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be an idiot.</p>

			<p>The muslims are not invading Europe.  They were invited by the marxists to help destroy Christendom.  The marxists think they can convert the muslims to marxism.  The muslims think they can <br>
out-breed the marxists and eventually overpower the remnants.  Christendom is essentially dead both culturally and religiously.  Neither creed is compatible with freedom.  What third force will conquer both the muslims and marxists, and will it be compatible with human growth and freedom?  I wish I knew.  I don&rsquo;t like what I am imagining.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Muslims are creating a parallel world in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course muslims are creating a parallel world in Europe.  They&rsquo;re doing the same thing all over the Western world.</p>
<p>But, then again, every single third world import into Western countries is creating a parallel world.  They retain their religions, their customs, traditions, languages, and their allegience to their countries of origin. And their true loyalties lie with their original country and their countrymen.</p>
<p>They set up civic organizations within these parallel worlds to advance their interests and aims as well.  None of them would even consider giving five seconds of their time or ANY of their loyalties to this country.  This is a place to make money.  That&rsquo;s all.  </p>
<p>While they&rsquo;re here, however,  they insist on more opportunities for themselves and their brats, and they make no secret of pushing to have as many opportunities and advantages they can get for their tribe.  If they can&rsquo;t get what they want, they&rsquo;ll protest and call the white inhabitants here racists.  And if they get really upset over not having their tantrums addressed they&rsquo;ll riot.</p>
<p>Only the densest of morons would ever regard huge influxes of immigrants to a nation as a strength and refer fondly to it as diversity.</p>
<p>Diversity is dangerous and is unequivocally a recipe for disaster.  From time to time this pluralistic nonsense proves what a failure it is by presenting catastrophes like the finance collapse that is now occurring, and it gives much promise of creating others which will destroy the country, but it isn&rsquo;t within the ability of elitist snobs to recognize the folly of their perverted agendas, and since they control about everything, the rest of us can do nothing but be ultra prepared, wait and watch until it is time for us to declare ourselves and offer teaching lessons to the radical leftist dimwits.</p>

			<p>Jihadistan declared war against the United States not on 9/11/01 but in 1784.  It was in that year that two American merchant vessels, the Marie of Boston and the Dauphin of Philadelphia were captured by Algerian corsairs and their crews held for ransom.  When Thomas Jefferson, then U.S. Minister to the Court of France in Versailles asked the Ottoman ambassador why they were hostile to the United States, this was the reply: &ldquo;That it was founded on the Laws of their Prophet, that it was written in their Koran, that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as Prisoners, and that every Musselman who should be slain in Battle was sure to go to Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was this statement which amounted to a declaration of war by Jihadistan that caused Congress to authorize the building and staffing of six frigates, in fact it created the United States Navy.</p>

			<p>I have no problem with the Muslim way of life, Their holy book and perfect man Mohomet. My problem is with the feminization of the white western man that has allowed this Iconic culture to invade,transform and conquer the western homelands. I suppose as reaction to WWI WWII and following western wars or wars on communism, we have attempted to Greatly curb natural masculine aggressive instints of cultural preservation that is seen as inciting these conflicts. These Natural instints of familial, ethnic, national or racial pride which were once seen as healthy, have eventualy been condemned as zenophobic and hateful,primitive etc. While I am all for the most congenial relations with all, as much as possible, seeing the common humanity in all&hellip; We can see this genteelness can cost us our racial survival as well the great advances in society that were spearheaded by the western mans love of REASON which prevented him from being a permanent subservient to any taboo that showed cracks when under the scrutiny of REASON. We must awaken ourselves as to our uniqueness in this apparently genetic proclivity and regain our natural instinct of survival as a race or be debased and destroyed. RACE MATTERS </p>

			<p>People should look into who and what was behind the anti-white immigration laws put in place throughout the Western World from the mid 1960&rsquo;s through the early 1970&rsquo;s. Conspiracy? All you need are dedicated people geared toward a common goal. In this case, the common goal was the destruction of whites and the West. Big business is a Johnny Come Lately, hopping on the anti-white bandwagon after starting to reap the &#8220;rewards&#8221; of cheap, non-white labor. The anti-white immigration laws, like the Immigration Act of 1965 in the US, a piece of stealth legislation, should be examined by everyone here, by all whites. Once you look at how this piece of traitorous legislation came about, the picture becomes much more clear. We are truly at war with these hypocritical elitists, and our enemies will use any and all the two-legged weapons they can, mexicans, africans, blacks, chinese, muslims, any and all of them against us. People saying the Muslims are behind this are merely part of the smokescreen. The Muslims are tools, just like latino and other non-white immigrants in the US. </p>

			<p>Why can&rsquo;t we have an American version of Geert Wilders? I hate to say this, are we really dumb for not following Europe&rsquo;s lead? I thought 2008 is the year when nationalists of European American descent and even Americans of other races rise up against mass immigration, multiculturalism, and anti-white hatred from Third World countries. Now we have two clowns running for President of the United States, our future in America maybe uncertain. Will the last American pick up our flag and move to Europe or Australia? </p>

			<p><i>Pass laws making it their lives in Europe uncomfortable. Put pork vendors out on the streets. Hang crucifixes in the classrooms. Make it against the law to wear hajibs, burkhas and headscarfs in public arenas. I guarantee if you adopt these measures and plenty more like them their populations will dry up in no time.<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree that it will be so simple as that. You can put all the crucifixes in classrooms that you want   &mdash;    that won&rsquo;t have a significant effect beyond just annoying them.  Not until the ECONOMIC attractions and benefits of Europe dry up will they go home.   For many of them, Europe is the only home they&rsquo;ve ever known.   And considering how wretched life is back in Morocco and elsewhere, you would have to make their lives truly MISERABLE  before they saw life back  there as something preferable.   Frankly, that&rsquo;s not likely ever to happen.  I just don&rsquo;t see it.  </p>
<p>No, forceful expulsions will be necessary.   Voluntary &#8220;inducements&#8221; will not succeed.  They won&rsquo;t go on their own, and they won&rsquo;t go peacefully either.   Europe is in for a ride!   But it didn&rsquo;t have to happen;  Europeans brought it on themselves.</p>
<p>I could add to this comment that while I am extremely sympathetic to Mr. Wilders and the Dutch, I am also slightly annoyed that this speech focuses so entirely on Moslems and nothing else.   Yes, they are undeniably a threat;  but they are not the only problem facing Europe.   Even if there were no Moslems to worry about, there are still other looming issues that threaten Europe&rsquo;s future just as much, and which Mr. Wilders does not mention at all.  He seems to be concerned only about religion.  Race  (the great unmentionable, especially in Holland!) is completely unacknowledged.   </p>
<p>Still, I wish him all the best.  I suppose he has his plate full with one thing at a time.</p>

			<p>This singular obsession with Muslim immigration makes me wonder if the coming surge of African and Hindu immigration will be shrugged off for political reasons.  Reminds me of old White people who threaten Germans (seriously) and Russians with all kinds of retribution, yet meekly accept non-White immigrants.  This &#8220;neo-con&#8221; and Anglo obsession with maintaining their status by slaughtering their co-ethnics is ruinous.</p>

			<p>The battle against western civilization whether based on race or culture is immense, your battle and that of Europe is one and the same, the brutality of WW2 was just so immense that the west turned its back on its own inheritance, there are however voices of reason abound in America there is Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s Amren.com, vdare.com; theoccidentalquarterly.com; the-turning.blogspot.com and a variety of others they agree and disagree on many things in Europe you have brusselsjournal.com; ave-imperator.blogspot.com and my favorite gatesofvienna.blogspot.com</p>
<p>So how does the order change? Unfortunately political discourse is not changed through the words of wise men but when fighting becomes inevitable. The Volke(identities) in Europe are small only once they constitute a minority no longer willing to die peacefully will we witness change it will be violent and quick, and in the aftermath people need answers, what Mr. Taylor and others are doing is to lay the foundations for the revival, the answers. What we consider as natural and obvious are not necessarily so for the populous.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt the threat of Islam to Europe but is it possible it&rsquo;s being exaggerated a bit? Fifty-four million muslims? Maybe if you count the populations living in the Balkans region but in Western Europe there are about 18 million. That bit about America being the last man standing is laughable. Maybe we don&rsquo;t have alot of muslims but we have plenty of blacks and Mexicans and an endless supply of third world immigration that will run &#8220;America into the ground in alot less time than Europe will be conquered by muslims. America is 62% European, Europe is 5% muslim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wilders is NOT pro-White, only anti-Muslim.  For him, and the folks at the Hudson Institute, a majority non-White Netherlands or America is NOT a problem at all, as long as Muslims aren&rsquo;t part of the picture.  Actually, for the folks at the neo-con oriented Hudson Institute, dispossessing European Americans is one of their prime goals.  </p>

<p>Europe and America are two very different stories.</p>
<p>In Europe, Muslims (and Africans and everyone else) have taken full advantage of the crisis of civilizational confidence which has led to so much mushy liberalism.  The European elites simply know no way out now.  Taking the steps to save themselves racially, or hell, even culturally, requires admitting their beliefs about reality are wrong, which means admitting that the way they lived their lives was wrong, that the obsession with free sex, drugs and bashing every single thing their forefathers ever did was all wrong; humans can&rsquo;t do this so easily and yet the need to could not be greater.</p>

			<p>I want to give you some insight on why I think this is happening.  When I was growing up which was 30 years ago, Whites were different than they are today.  They were smarter, genetically healthier, had more values and morals and had more faith in God.  Take organizations like the National Organization for Women which at one time were thought to be champions for women&rsquo;s rights have been revealed to have only one singular purpose, aggressively defending a woman&rsquo;s right to murder her unborn children.  You have to wonder why?  It&rsquo;s pretty shocking how people have been mesmerized by these evil things. </p>

The answer to your question is,<b> &#8220;No, they don&rsquo;t.&#8221;  </b><br>
 <br>
Without powerful backing  and sponsorship from sympathetic white groups,  U.S. blacks would be little more than a  burden and a nuisance.  Disbelieve me?   I recommend you look into the founding, funding, and organization or the NAACP (just for an example). Until very recently, it was ALWAYS run by whites.</p>

They are &#8220;different&#8221;, yes   &mdash;    but only somewhat.  What is  far more important in this case is that the  &#8220;elites&#8221;  referred to are the same.   </p>
<p>Sorry, I have to agree with Mexifornia. He&rsquo;s got the picture right.</p>
<p>I get the impression after reading this article, that Mr. Wilders would have no problem receiving a tribe of newly converted  Dinkas or Shilluks from the Sudan, just so long as they&rsquo;re &#8220;born again&#8221;.  Or a village of black Falasha &#8220;Jews&#8221; imported  from Ethiopia.   Or a  bunch of primitive animists from the darkest Congo.  Or a shipment of Hindu beggars from Calcutta   &mdash;   just so long as they&rsquo;re not Muslims.  Otherwise, they&rsquo;re all OK.  That&rsquo;s his only hang-up.  No Muslins!  Well, it&rsquo;s not mine.</p>
<p>I am not defending them, but as Mexifornia says, the Muslins, Mexicans, et al, are merely tools being used by others to weaken us and undermine us.  Without powerful help,  they would be incapable of doing that alone.  (Who worked to change the laws and bring them in?  The Moslems didn&rsquo;t.)  Throughout the 20th century, the Communists (and others) have used them for this purpose.</p>
<p>I would never suggest that the Muslim problem is an exaggeration.  And I  heartily agree that:  &#8220;They are using our system for their benefit and most white people are too brain dead to respond appropriately&#8221;.  But I don&rsquo;t think the Muslim problem is our ONLY problem either.   Let me put it this way:   If all the Muslims vanished tomorrow, would the USA suddenly be free of all its demographic problems?</p>

			<p>Michael T, it&rsquo;s a group of elites behind all of this in Europe and the US. The Muslims are no more real control of anything than the blacks, mestizos or other non-whites in the US. They&rsquo;re all puppets, just like everyone in DC. The whole plan is going to collapse and whites will have to dig themselves out. But it&rsquo;s going to have to get worse, a lot worse, before whites, your average, everyday white, is forced to face reality and breaks free of the one-eyed bolshevik in the living room that has been the greatest brainwashing tool in mankind&rsquo;s history. Anyone trying to tell whites that Muslims or blacks or mestizos are running the show, are directing things, are doing this without being led in some fashion is merely trying to throw whites off the trail of those truly responsible for the current situation in the West. </p>

Blacks???  They don&rsquo;t have the power, organization, or brains to  &#8220;control&#8221;  us. They can&rsquo;t even get control of themselves.

			<p>Wilders obscures and misunderstands the bigger picture. First off, Islam, Blacks, Mexicans, etc are not our true enemies. Our true enemies are our elites who use these non-White hordes as tools of destruction against the mass of ordinary Whites.</p>
<p>Who wants Islamic Turkey in the EU? It&rsquo;s the same internationalist Usual Suspects who want the population of Mexico to be emptied into America until we become a third world country.</p>
<p>Who writes the hate speech and hate crime laws? Who owns the central banks and mass media? It isn&rsquo;t the Muslims, Blacks or Mexicans.</p>
<p>Wilders also wrongly assumes that assimilation is a good thing. Better balkanization than assimilation, because assimilation is euphemism for miscegenation. </p>
<p>Wilders also wrongly assumes that what we see in the West today is cowardice or stupidity on the part of our elites, when in reality the mass influx of non-Whites and all the trouble they create for us was foreseeable and INTENDED. Our elites INTEND for these third worlders to rob, pillage, assault, dispossess, rape and murder us out of existence. That should be obvious to even the most deaf dumb and blind at this point, but for some reason Wilders and other so-called Nationalists don&rsquo;t seem to get it.</p>
<p>Until they get it they will continute inveighing pointlessly against the tools of our destruction rather than against the wielders of those tools. </p>

<p>His anti-Islam program is, at bottom line, of very little use to us at all. It only distracts us from all the other issues. He&rsquo;s like a person in a sinking boat who&rsquo;s trying frantically to bail out the front of the boat, while water continues pouring in the back.<br>

<p>  &#8220;Wilders also wrongly assumes that assimilation is a good thing. Better balkanization than assimilation, because assimilation is euphemism for miscegenation.&#8221;  &hellip;. 12:59AM</p>
<p>  Absolutely!   Very good point.  Having these alien groups planted in our midst as distinct colonies is bad enough, but assimilating (i.e. miscegenating) with them would be even worse. That is not in our interest. They would destroy us, our gene pool,  and who we are (whether muslims or not).  It is clear that Wilders is not interested in gene pools.</p>
<p>  Yes, Wilders gets a lot of things wrong   &mdash;   whether naively or deliberately. His only expressed concern is strictly limited to muslims. Also, the fact that he is here as the guest of the neocon Hudson Institute  &mdash;    that alone makes me suspicious.</p>

<i>Dear friends,<br>
Thank you very much for inviting me. Great to be at the Four Seasons&hellip;.<br>
It&rsquo;s great to be in New York. <br>
 <br>
The Europe you know is changing. All is not well in the old world. You have probably seen the landmarks. The Eiffel Tower and Trafalgar Square and Rome&rsquo;s ancient buildings and  canals of Amsterdam. They are still there.  But in all of these cities, sometimes a few blocks away from your tourist destination, there is another world, a world very few visitors see &mdash; and one that does not appear in your tourist guidebook.   Paris is now surrounded by a ring of Muslim neighbourhoods&hellip;.. </i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Wilders, <br>
Thank you for the compliments.  But what&rsquo;s so great about being in New York?  Of course, you&rsquo;re staying (or dining) at the Four Seasons,  one of NY&rsquo;s most opulent locations, on Park Avenue in Midtown  Manhattan.  The city looks beautiful  from there. But it gives you a distorted view.  To us with devalued dollars, it&rsquo;s nice to know that you can afford to come here and live in such grand style.  (Your party must be well financed indeed. )</p>
<p>But have you strayed far  from the &#8220;landmarks&#8221; and the &#8220;tourist destinations&#8221;?  New York is not unlike Paris, London, or Amsterdam at all.  If you stray a short distance from Park Avenue, you will come to Harlem, &#8220;another world&#8221; as you say.  Just don&rsquo;t stray there alone.  In fact, away from the major attractions,  New York is also surrounded by a ring of darkening outer neighborhoods (though not necessarily Islamic).  Just like Paris, it too has areas that &#8220;very few visitors see&#8221;,  or would want to,   neighborhoods that are no-go areas where even the police do not venture alone.  This is true of all our large cities across the USA,  not just New York.</p>
<p>Granted, not all our problems here are with Moslems.  But would you prefer a Haitian ghetto or a Mexican barrio to a Moroccan or Turkish one?   There really isn&rsquo;t too much difference.  In seeing only the Moslem menace,  you are missing the greater picture.  You think things are fine here?   Sadly, you are unable to  see the forest for the trees. This predicament that confronts us is less about religion than about race.</p>
