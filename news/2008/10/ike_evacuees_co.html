<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26979307/">Ike Evacuees Complain of Violence at Shelter</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, October 1, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Accounts of what happened in the Wal-Mart [converted into a shelter for evacuees], drawn from interviews and public records obtained by The Associated Press, raise questions about the soundness of the state&rsquo;s evacuation plan.</p>
<p>Days before Ike hit the Gulf Coast on Sept. 13, more than 3,000 Beaumont residents were taken by bus to Tyler even though the city had told the state it could accommodate only about half that number. The result was a chaotic experience that many won&rsquo;t soon forget.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought, &lsquo;Oh Lord, just get us out of here,&rsquo;&#8221; said Verlinda Antoine, 52. &#8220;The conditions were too bad for anyone, and they treated us like they didn&rsquo;t want us there. It was a nightmare.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many claimed that the building was unsanitary and that fear of crime and violence was constant.</p>
<p>When a fight between two women in a smoking area attracted numerous onlookers on the second night, police swarmed. Four people, including two juveniles, were arrested on charges that included disorderly conduct and interfering with a police officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;People refused to move out of the way and wouldn&rsquo;t stop fighting,&#8221; Tyler Police Chief Gary Swindle said. The Taser was used after a couple of people threatened an officer with a chair, he said.</p>
<p><b>Tales of chaos</b></p>
<p>But some evacuees tell a different story, saying police were overly aggressive and used racial slurs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conditions at the shelter improved the day after the storm, when about half the evacuees were moved to other places.</p>
<p><b>Preparations under question</b></p>
<p>Still, questions remain about whether Tyler was capable of hosting thousands of evacuees and whether the shelter where most of them were sent should have been used.</p>
<p>Less than two weeks earlier, Louisiana officials were criticized for placing thousands of Hurricane Gustav evacuees from New Orleans in a vacant Sam&rsquo;s Club in Shreveport, La., and an abandoned Wal-Mart in Bastrop, La. A top state official resigned in the aftermath.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the circumstances were different for Ike. Several large Tyler shelters that had housed Gustav evacuees, including the city&rsquo;s convention center, were unavailable because they were needed for future events or being used for other purposes.</p>

			<p>They all probably thought they were going to the Marriott for a twelve month free stay to include the &#8220;honor bar&#8221;, &#8220;Maids &#8220;, and &#8220;Room Service&#8221;. A Wal Mart can be a let down. Yes, the white man screwed the black man again, happens all the time. <br>

			<p>Never; but, never, ever, interrupt the bruthas and sistas when they&rsquo;re beating the daylights out of each other. If you do, and you&rsquo;re white and in law enforcement, you&rsquo;ll be slandered or physically attacked - or both.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s &#8220;authentically black&#8221; to be near mortally offended if called  the &#8220;n&#8221; word, especially when they&rsquo;re drawing blood on each other.  </p>
<p>Gouging, slicing, stabbing, and bone-breaking = good.<br>
The &#8220;n&#8221; word = bad. </p>
<p>Got it?      </p>
<p>My recommendation to all law enforcement people: When you come upon blacks ripping each other&rsquo;s head&rsquo;s off, gently try to break it up while saying nothing.  Then backoff when black bystanders begin to cause trouble.  Get back in your squad cars, leave the area, and let the mayhem work itself out.</p>
<p>Those blacks with IQ&rsquo;s near 90 will learn that interrupting law enforcement can get Jamal or Laquisha killed because the former will leave.  Maybe then they&rsquo;ll spread the word in the ghetto. </p>

			<p>How many major disasters of one kind or the other, from fires to floods and back, have befallen White Americans in the past several years? Have you EVER ONCE heard tales of this kind from White &#8220;evacuees&#8221; or refugees from the chaos? Has anyone here heard or read of a single story like that which follows Blacks wherever the pre-storm currents take them? Even in the face of impending disaster, Blacks cannot mend their ways!</p>

Governmental media indoctrination agents can spin it any way they want, but the fact remains, any time you have a congregation of &#8220;Blacks&#8221; you have problems. </p>

			<p>A little story about NYC and the blackout. I think it was in the 70&rsquo;s. I lived in Manhattan in Yorkville which is now called the Upper East Side. The lights went out at night and rather than sit by myself in a dark apartment I decided to go down to my favorite pub. The owners had put candles on the bar and they also put some chairs and tables outside. So, there we were sitting outside having some drinks and singing some songs. (One of the regulars had brought his guitar.)We were just sitting out there enjoying ourselves. </p>
<p>Along comes one of the neighborhood cops we knew and he looks at us and says, &#8220;I am so glad to be back here with my people! I was just up in Harlem. They&rsquo;re going crazy up there. They&rsquo;re looting all the stores, they&rsquo;re stealing anything that isn&rsquo;t nailed down. It&rsquo;s a zoo! I am just so glad to be back here!&#8221; </p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>By the way, the stupid mayor wouldn&rsquo;t allow the cops to touch the looters, so hundreds of small business owners lost everything. The small busines owners were, of course, Black. </p>

			<p>I evidently missed the white looters during the Kansas floods. Then again it will not be long before the news is manipulated to show white looters. Remember the white woman repeatedly zoomed in on because she had a loaf of bread during Katrina. This of course compares quite unfavorably to the fat black policewomen looting Wal-Mart&hellip;..</p>

			<p>Police brutality. &#8220;They treated us like they didn&rsquo;t want us there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here we go again (and again, and again). Note the key phrase: &#8220;more than 3,000 Beaumont residents were taken by bus to Tyler even though the city had told the state it could accommodate only about half that number.&#8221; So you overcrowd facilities and naturally, tempers will flare. Particularly given the Black expectations that the &#8220;have everything&#8221; Whites should cater to them and treat them like visiting royalty.</p>
<p>Blacks appear to be their own worst enemy. Any time you read the news, that concept gets reinforced as you read about drug-related shootings, stabbings, drive-by attacks.</p>
<p>I read in a local website someone suggesting the &#8220;government&#8221; should give each Galveston, Texas homeowner a minimum of $50,000. Most of those homeowners suffering flood losses being Blacks. Does anyone recall those government debit cards issued to NOLA refugees in Houston? Blacks spending the money on night clubs, strip joints, designer handbags, expensive pistols&hellip; Then clamoring for more money being handed out&hellip; they didn&rsquo;t get enough.</p>
<p>Speaking of New Orleans&hellip; I am NOT aware that White police officers were &#8220;forced to steal, I mean &#8220;borrow&#8221; 28 Cadillacs in the aftermath of Ike to patrol the streets of Houston. Guess that problem is another one, indigenous to New Orleans&rsquo; utterly corrupt administration.</p>

			<p>Why is it that only minorities get all bent out of shape when they hear refer to them by using a racial slur, but whites never do?  </p>
<p>Could the fact that whites are intelligent enough to understand that any racial slur aimed at whites is just another way of saying &#8220;white&#8221; and because we are proud of our race we have no reason to be upset?  </p>
<p>Are minorities so ashamed of being minorities that they come emotionally unglued when called a slur that is nothing more than another word that defines their race or ethnicity?   </p>

			<p>In the book <i>A Mighty Fortress</i> by Harold Covington, the following (paraphrased) exchange takes place:</p>
<p>&#8220;And another thing! There are to be NO racial epithets used in here! NONE!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen here. As long as I&rsquo;ve got this shootin&rsquo; iron on my hip, and I&rsquo;m ready and able to use it, I&rsquo;ll say n****r all I want!&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we need to get back to. Not gratuitously insulting people who are minding their own business, but right upside the head of the self appointed thought police.</p>

<p>Posted by at 4:54 PM on October 3</p>
<p>Yes, not only unglued but they are hoping for a huge payday as well.  Why work when you can make more money suing evil Whitey over perceived racism?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;An Oakland landlady who allegedly berated an African American tenant with racial slurs and told him that &#8216;you&rsquo;re not going to turn this place into a ghetto&rsquo; must pay the man and his wife $31,000 in damages, a state civil rights agency has ruled&hellip;O&rsquo;Neill, who now lives in Florida, repeated her denial of the allegations in an interview this week and said she may appeal the ruling in Superior Court. &#8216;I&rsquo;d been nothing but nice to this young couple,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;He (Lemons) called the race card.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/02/BAFK139RCC.DTL" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/02/BAFK139RCC.DTL</a></p>
<p>Yeah, that makes perfect sense: A &#8216;state civil rights agency&rsquo; has demanded a transfer of $31,000 from a White to blacks who were &#8216;offended&rsquo; by something she said.</p>
<p>Remember:  In today&rsquo;s world there is no First Amendment  &mdash;  at least not for Whites.</p>
<p>I suspect with an obama presidency we&rsquo;ll see a lot more of this type of activity, directed only at Whites, of course. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll appoint a &#8216;Racial Commission&rsquo; directed at rooting out evil, racist Whites in order to terrorize them and sue them into oblivion.</p>
<p>And who do you think he will nominate to the Supreme Court?  A racist, subversive ACLU lawyer?  A White-hating NAACP lawyer/activist?  Or perhaps a &#8216;shout-out&rsquo; to the invader community with an anti-White LaRaza community organizer?</p>
