<h1><a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2008/10/arizona-arizona.html">Arizona, Arizona State &amp; Nebraska Law Schools Accused of Discrimination Against White Applicants</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>TaxProf Blog, October 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Center for Equal Opportunity issued a report today accusing Nebraska law school of engaging in racial discrimination by impermissibly favoring black and Hispanic applicants over white applicants.  Last week, the group issued similar reports on Arizona and Arizona State law schools.  (Nebraska is one of the states with a proposed ban on the use of affirmative action by state agencies on the ballot; supporters failed to gather sufficient signatures to get a similar ban on the ballot in Arizona.)  For more, see the Chronicle of Higher Education (Part I (Arizona &amp; Arizona State), Part II (Nebraska)).</p>
<p>Below the fold are the charts in the reports showing the 25%, 50% and 75th percentile LSAT scores of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White admittees at Arizona, Arizona State, and Nebraska:</p>
<p>With voters in Colorado and Nebraska preparing to vote on proposals to bar affirmative action, supporters and defenders of the consideration of race in admissions decisions are releasing new research to bolster their positions.</p>
<p>The Center for Equal Opportunity &mdash; a group that has worked for years to bar the consideration of race and ethnicity &mdash; on Wednesday issued findings about admissions to the law school at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. Those data show significant race and ethnicity gaps in the LSAT scores and college grades of applicants who were admitted in recent years to the law school.</p>
<p>At the same time, two sociologists have just published an analysis suggesting that affirmative action is in decline &mdash; and has never been as widespread as some imagine in states that have barred the use of race in admissions decisions.</p>

															<h2>CEO Releases New Study Documenting Racial and Ethnic Preferences at U of Nebraska Law School</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Center for Equal Opportunity, October 9, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>A new study released today by the Center for Equal Opportunity documents evidence of severe discrimination based on race and ethnicity in law school admissions at the University of Nebraska. African Americans and, to a lesser extent, Latinos are admitted with significantly lower undergraduate grade-point averages and LSAT scores than whites and, again to a lesser extent, Asians.</p>
<p>The study is based on data supplied by the University itself. The study was prepared by Dr. Althea Nagai, a resident fellow at CEO, and can be viewed on the organization&rsquo;s website, www.ceousa.org. The executive summary of the study is attached.</p>
<p>CEO president Roger Clegg will answer questions about the study when it is formally released at a press conference today at 10:30 a.m. in Lincoln at the University of Nebraska (Nebraska City Campus Union, Pewter Room).</p>
<p>CEO chairman Linda Chavez noted that the odds ratio favoring African Americans over whites was 442 to 1. She pointed out, &#8220;During the two years studied (the entering classes of 2006 and 2007), 389 whites were rejected by the law school despite higher LSATs and undergraduate GPAs than the average black admittee. Racial discrimination in university admissions is always appalling. But the extremely heavy weight given to race by the University of Nebraska College of Law is off the charts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roger Clegg stressed that not only was race weighed, but it was weighed much more heavily than residency status: &#8220;For instance, a white resident of Nebraska in 2007 was more than twenty times less likely to be admitted than an African American applicant from out of state.&#8221;</p>
<p>CEO also analyzed undergraduate admissions, but did not find statistical evidence of discrimination there, based on the data provided by the University. The University&rsquo;s medical school refused to supply similar data jointly requested by CEO and the Nebraska Association of Scholars.<br/>

			<p>My law school class was 100 percent white.  The school administration would have LOVED to have some black students, but not a single black applied, qualified or otherwise.  Apparently, no blacks were interested.  I know this because I was on the student admission advisory committee in my third year.  <br/>
Somehow, we managed to muddle through without the blessing of &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  Really, it&rsquo;s remarkable that I have a job today and that I&rsquo;m a competent attorney, considering that I wasn&rsquo;t exposed to blacks in school.</p>

			<p>My semi-prestigious law school had a cadre of black students who were obviously admitted based on their remarkable and unique ability to be black, and it created nothing but resentment among the student body.  We all had White friends who were denied admission, even though it was patently obvious that our White friends would have made better students (and better lawyers) than the blacks who were admitted.</p>
<p>The blacks brought nothing whatsoever to the academic environment of the school.  They sat on the front row in every class, and the professors dutifiully looked over their heads and never called on them to answer a question or to engage in the dreaded Socratic &#8220;grillings.&#8221;  For the most part, the AA blacks were ignored and resented by the White students.  (Lest anyone think we were being unfair, there were also had a few black students who were obviously admitted on merit, and they engaged in the everyday school and classroom activities just as any other student).</p>
<p>I checked up on some of my black classmates, and for many of them I could find no record of their having been admitted to the bar in any State, meaning they were passed through our state-university law school and never passed the bar exam.  In other words, they took up space, denying others the opportunity in the process, and no one has anything to show for it. </p>

			<p>The human mind is infinitely malleable. And now after fifty years of directed negative subliminal programming, a la Edward Bernays and the Chicago School of Behavior Modification, the once stalwart white man has been reduced to a sports fan.  No more proof is needed for this observation.</p>

An excellent post, Legal Eagle. If I ever get myself in any trouble, you&rsquo;re the type of attorney I&rsquo;d want on my side. </p>
<p>No Affirmative Action bench-warmers or quota-fillers need apply. <br/>

			<p>I think it would be more interesting to document the process that seats so many black lawyers on the judges bench.</p>

			<p>My law school had two black students.  One of them was the daughter of a judge and appeared to be competent.  The other was a current NYC policeman.  I was in a legal writing class, sitting behind him.  When the class ended I noticed he had left a writing sample on his desk.  I looked at it.  He was practically illiterate.  He lasted a few weeks.</p>

			<p>Hey &#8220;Legal Eagle&#8221;, why don&rsquo;t you and other &#8220;like minded&#8221; lawyers get together and take up &#8220;our&#8221; cause? We, as Whites, need an NAACP with powerful CONSERVATIVE lawyers that will fight for us.What about it people! Are there any other lawyers on this site that can give some insight on what it would take to get something like this off the ground, maybe start a fund or something?</p>

			<p>I have not read Bill Clinton&rsquo;s autobio., but reputedly he admits he taught a black male at the U of AR law school who needed tutoring in spelling, punctuation, and grammar; the guy was supposedly able to give correct answers to test questions but did so with very poor writing. Clinton actually favored affirmative action (so the story goes) BECAUSE of the student&rsquo;s illiteracy! In fact, it was someone at this site who quoted the story which I could not believe, even for a liberal like Bill. </p>

			<p>From my firsthand experience at UNL: an unscientific rant.</p>
<p>I graduated magna cum lade from undergrad.  I was admitted to UNL College of Law among 140 students.  About 10 students were black, 6 had Hispanic sounding names.  Nearly all of these students kicked my arse in rankings.  They passed bar exams and now work as attorneys. I am not surprised.  From my subjective point of view, they were very sharp in class and extraordinary hardworking out of class. (I always think of a group of girls who worked 8-9 hours in the library every day!)</p>
<p>There are always a few students in each class that should&rsquo;ve never been admitted.  It&rsquo;s patently obvious to everyone but them.  I was one of them.  I seemed to exemplify the competitive loser.  There was a child of privilege who was too quick to inject irrelevant into every discussion.  I did one better.  There was a natural born orator who liked to spew worthless dicta that made everyone&rsquo;s eyes roll.  I made everyone cover their faces to hide their tortured grimaces as I listened to myself talk.</p>
<p>I passed 2 bar exams, but developed no skills to get a legal job.  I check people into hotel.  I am the ultimate charity case, and I am white.</p>
<p>Is this relevant?  Some will say it&rsquo;s not, and direct you to read my admissions in the second paragraph.  Others will agree that law schools are there to make lawyers not 1Ls.  I conclude, that UNL succeeded in finding better lawyer material among the minority students no matter what their admission metrics were.  The end.<br/>
