<h1>The Trouble With Black Boys .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Farley, Nationnews (Barbados), October 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>PRESIDENT of the Barbados Association of Principals of Public Secondary Schools, Mr Jeff Broomes, and I attended the Second Annual Conference of the Adelaide Sanford Institute. The theme of this year&rsquo;s conference was Creating A Culture Of Success For Students Of African Ancestry.</p>
<p>As I sat through the various sessions, there was a sense in which I could easily have been sitting in the Frank Collymore Hall or UWI, Cave Hill, listening to Professor Errol Miller speaking to the issues affecting black men, who, according to him, are marginalised.</p>
<p>In short, though in New York with all its racial overtones and issues of equity, I felt moved to ask the same questions and raise the same issues with reference to black boys in Barbados.</p>
<p>Professor Pedro Noguera, of New York University delivered the keynote address at the opening ceremony. His theme was: The Trouble With Black Boys. I say black boys because it seems as though the boys of other ethnic groups do not suffer the same plight.</p>
<p>Certainly in Barbados the descendants of the Asian communities are not in crisis. There is no evidence to suggest that white boys in Barbados are in any trouble unless it remains within the confines of the &#8220;clan.&#8221; Everywhere across the African Diaspora the black males are in deep crisis. So what&rsquo;s the trouble with them?</p>
<p><b>Marginalised</b></p>
<p>As I look at black boys across the social landscape, I feel very sorry for them. For not only are they marginalised but many of them have no sense of who they are or where they are going. By their behaviour, young black males seem always to feel that they must do something outrageous to prove themselves.</p>
<p>As I travel through the various districts daily, under every breadfruit tree, at every corner, behind every wall and sometimes behind every paling you will find cumulatively, thousands of young black boys, men who are characterised as outlined below.</p>
<p>Many have never worked or do not plan to do so. Many of them have CXC qualifications but are qualified to do nothing. The overall profile represents a colossal waste of human potential which apparently no other race suffers.</p>
<p>Let me assert up front that the problem with black boys in Barbados has nothing to do with their intellect. Indeed the history of the black race is replete with unsurpassed intellectual brilliance out of which sprang both mathematical and scientific inventions.</p>
<p>The intellectual capacity is there. Part of the problem is that our black boys, and indeed the black race on the whole, have been told a whole heap of lies about themselves that over time they have come to believe and internalise. The minds of black boys must be purged of all the lies and myths about self and the psyche and must be educated afresh before black boys and black men can emerge as a positive force with which to be reckoned.</p>
<p><b>Absence of males</b></p>
<p>The trouble with black boys in Barbados is inextricably bound up in the glaring absence of the males, the fathers within their lives. Approximately 42 per cent of homes across the Caribbean are headed by females. The fathers from whose loins the &#8220;black boys&#8221; have sprung are absent.</p>
<p>The fact is that boys who have been deprived of the powerful and overwhelming influence of a father can never reflect the benefits of fatherhood and understand the values of responsibility, industry, respect and the call to manhood. In spite of the tremendous impact that single mothers have on boys, not even the greatest mother can teach her son to be a man.</p>
<p>In a strange and perverse way, the black community, itself, has started to wage a kind of war against young black men and has become part of this destructive process.</p>
<p>The trouble with black boys is the trouble with black families. It is the trouble that plagues black communities and the trouble that continues to haunt the black race. It is, in part, the problem of self-doubt, of imitation and a culture of failure for which a strong counter-narrative must be initiated with much urgency. The question as to what is the trouble with black boys cannot remain rhetorical; it must be answered now, if the threat to the social order is to be averted.<br>

			<p>The only way to fix the &#8220;trouble with black boys&#8221; would be several generations of ruthless selective breeding, combined <br>
with some admixture from other races, like North Asians. This <br>
works for dog breeders, to remove undesirable features from the <br>
breed. </p>
<p>It would never happen, and even if it could, I think it would <br>
be more beneficial then to just give up on them, and use that <br>
technique to improve the white race, and other races. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more likely that the future is dysgenic breeding a la <br>
&#8220;Idiocracy&#8221;. Once I thought we&rsquo;d head for space, but if <br>
our future is more Africans, I guess not. <br>

Reminds me of the life changing episode of C.H.I.P.`S I saw while paying at a pet store. The tag line  was delivered by Officer Baker while putting a boy covered in green paint in the squad  car.   &#8220;Highschool stunts are for those students who are too lazy to earn recognition through acheivement&hellip;&#8221;  Sounds like the case here. Except for the High School part&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;can never reflect the benefits of fatherhood&#8221; Reminds me of the time I got a night school teacher to shut up for once from berating fathers in general and natural fathers in particular. She asked in anger if anyone could tell  her the benefits of having a &#8220;real&#8221; father and how ridiculous the whole concept was. As if I needed to point it out to AMRen posters she asked in a way that was NOT meant to be answered&hellip; Typical academic behavior from the thug class. I told the class a story about losing my wheel chair bound father at the grocery store. While I searched at the main aisle looking very annoyed, two men walked up laughing, &#8220;He just passed the Rolaids, heading toward  laxitive town.&#8221;  I asked the class if that could  have happened if I had been adopted. But it was the tape I brought the class that shut her mouth. It was a compilation of father /son wisdom captured on screen. The one that everyone liked best and shut the teachers blow hole for the semester was the scene in Superman where an elderly Glenn Ford grabs his son in a good natured headlock while musing, &#8220;I don`t know why you were sent here but  I know it wasn`t to score touchdowns!&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re black, that&rsquo;s the trouble with them.  And the black boys are not in crisis.  It&rsquo;s the unfortunate communities they live in that have to put up with their crime, rapes, murders, as well as support their numerous offspring who within 15 years turn into either feral thugs like their sperm donors or thug factories like their mamas. </p>

			<p>According to this genius, the problem in Barbardos is that blacks are <i><b>marginalized</b></i>?  </p>
<p> - &#8220;marginalize&#8221; =  <i>to relegate to an unimportant or powerless position within a society or group</i> [Merriam-webster]</p>
<p> - Demographics of Barbados:  Black 90%, White 4%, Asian and mixed 6%.  </p>
<p>How can 10% of a democratic country &#8220;relegate&#8221; the position of 90% of the country?  <br>

<p>Just this one lying paragraph makes his entire story totally unbelievable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unsurpassed brilliance?&#8221;   LOL!  He couldn&rsquo;t give even ONE instance to support such nonsense.</p>
<p>He should quit lying to himself and understand that blacks have a natural inclination for crime and violence and part of the reason is because they&rsquo;re dim witted and they can&rsquo;t succeed at anything because of it.</p>

<p>Sure it is.</p>
<p>The entire article is loaded with distortions, wishful thinking, fantasy, and pretend scholarship. The pandering is hard to stomach, but the quote above is beyond the pale.  This school mouthpiece can&rsquo;t even be honest about history and today&rsquo;s reality about blacks. It&rsquo;s as if the real truth about &#8220;black boys&#8221; and the black race is just too hard to accept. There is no place on the planet where blacks have settled peacefully.  That&rsquo;s, &#8220;no place&#8221;.  </p>
<p>How could anyone sit in that audience, and not bust out laughing is beyond me.  Then again, being majority black, they&rsquo;d probably be beaten senseless. </p>
<p>Black boys are produced by their mother&rsquo;s quick sexual unions, and then they&rsquo;re not parented.  They then become feral and prey on others, usually in packs.  </p>
<p>They reject education wholesale, and will beat the hell out of any kid who tries to achieve. State and federal government agencies pay their mommas no matter how many brothers and sisters she births. And lastly, the black boys know there will be black pseudo-academics in shiney suits who will blame whites (or any non-black) for their savagery and continued failures.  </p>
<p>Really now, was that so difficult?   <br>

			<p>Blacks are a huge majority of the population in Barbados as they are all across the Caribbean. They can not claim to be a discriminated minority at all. If black males choose to abandon their offspring and don&rsquo;t show any manly parental responsibility this pathology is the fault of the black race and ONLY the black race. Similar patterns exist in Africa and elsewhere. With blacks it&rsquo;s always the same. You can&rsquo;t eradicate genetic traits.</p>

<p>I struggled for 10 minutes to come up with some kind of comment for the above statement, something witty, something insightful, but I just don&rsquo;t know what to say about someone who could write something like this. I just hope not to many kids go to the school he went to.</p>

<p>The intellectual capacity is there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone who in text has to assert this thrice without giving an example or explaining the remark is lying to the reader and himself. To read any further is to buy into the typical Liberal mishmash that follows self-deception.</p>
<p>Avoiding any discussion of capacity and ability, the author goes into a bizarre recommendation of a total mind purge; &#8220;The minds of black boys must be purged of all the lies and myths about self and the psyche and must be educated afresh&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is where Obama will spend our Tax money, on a rework of the educational system of the third world.</p>

<p>Well, if that were true, there would be no need to write the article.  Those brilliant will genius boys would all be at home, reading math &amp; science books, preparing for their exams.

			<p>&#8220;Approximately 42 per cent of homes across the Caribbean are headed by females. The fathers from whose loins the &ldquo;black boys�? have sprung are absent&#8221;</p>
<p>What is absent is Africa.  In Africa, the blacks do things the black way. Nobody should be trying to make them fit our nuclear family model. It just leads to fustration.</p>

			<p>The overall profile represents a colossal waste of human potential which apparently no other race suffers.</p>
<p>Here lies the core of the problem.  A problem with no solution and created by whites, I might add.  Blacks have no potential.  Basically, they are a genetic dead end with little in the way of survival viability.  The average intellect is a low grade moron by modern standards, they have no potential for the cohesiveness necessary for more than the average small band of gatherers, constantly at war with other small bands of gatherers.  If the food isn&rsquo;t plentiful and lying on the ground, they starve.  To put it bluntly, they never evolved out of the stone age.</p>
<p>Everything they have.  Everything they ARE, has been given to them by other races, especially whites.  They are dependents.  A slave race to a people who have lost interest in enslaving them.  Out of guilt, we whites continue to provide for them, allowing them to expand far beyond what they should have.</p>
<p>But that situation is unsustainable.  One way or another, the largess of the white man will END.  When it does, there will be MASSIVE suffering and death among all blacks all over the world.  Over 99% of them will die off in a relatively short period of time.  They simply do not have ANY capacity for survival whatsoever.  It&rsquo;s as if you abandoned a large group of 5 year olds in the forest, alone, with a backpack full of goodies.  Some will die right away.  Many will last until the goodies run out.  Almost all will be done for within a week or two.  A cruel fate.</p>

			<p>The real trouble with black boys is that they are black boys with an average IQ of 85, a thug culture and no ambition. As long as they have a place to hang out, food to eat and a woman to &hellip; ummm, use &hellip; they are happy with no worries for the morrow.</p>

			<p>It would be a whole different situation if most blacks were gentle, sweet and shy, with their only problem being a low I.Q.  I think most people in the West could handle that situation.</p>
<p>Instead, blacks have the highest testosterone levels on average of all the races, so they easily experience the emotions of aggression and anger, plus they have high sex drives and low impulse control.  Add to this their low average intelligence, lack of introspection, and perpetual resentment/jealousy of white people.  Remember, whatever white taxpayers do for them, it will NEVER, EVER be enough because of the legacy of slavery!</p>
<p>Yes, I am sure Obama wants to greatly increase the federal dollars spent on education.  He probably thinks the reason black children fail is because not enough care is spent to make them feel validated and important and proud of Africa and blah, blah, blah.  Surely more BILLIONS of dollars spent on the schools will turn students with 85 I.Q.s into scholars and nuclear physicists with I.Q.s of 140?  Let me rush to my checkbook right this very moment!</p>

<p><br>
The local high school was getting out as I returned from work this afternoon. As happens on just about any given day, a group of mostly black &#8220;students&#8221; started across a busy intersection as soon as the light turned red. They took their time, trying to hold up as much traffic and be as obnoxious as possible.</p>
<p>Nothing new or unusual there, but what gets me every time I see this phenomenon is the look on some of their faces. Many of them are just screaming back and forth in their normal mode of &#8220;conversation&#8221;, oblivious to the waiting cars. But there&rsquo;s always one or two who give the drivers this simpleminded look of cheap triumph.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more pathetic than truly annoying, and it&rsquo;s obvious that this is the most significant moment of their school day: They get to make a bunch of white drivers stop and wait for them to cross the street against the red light.</p>
<p>At such moments I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I feel sorry for black &#8220;students&#8221;, but I do feel that it must really and truly suck to be them. And I don&rsquo;t see any way to modify the behavior, whether through &#8220;programs&#8221; or tutoring or mentoring or anything else. It appears to stem not only from profound alienation, but also from a simple lack of wherewithal to impress white people in any but a negative way.</p>

<p>Your connection was also right-on.  The lies by black tribal potentates are just piled on thick in a seemingly endless stream as black violence and chaos grows. These parasitic tribalists know they have not just an uneducated following, but they also have a willfully ignorant bunch of sheeple willing to believe anything they tell them.   </p>
<p>A good friend of mine, a court judge, upon his retirement said that chronic lying among blacks must be in their genetic code.  He said that even when caught in lies, they just kept lying on top of it, right in court.  </p>

			<p>Mr. Farley refers to black Africans no longer on the African continent as living in the &#8220;diaspora,&#8221; and thus somehow being disadvantaged when compared to those still in Africa.  I see no real difference between behavior and achievement levels of blacks still in Africa and those living elsewhere. </p>
<p>Just look to Zimbabwe and South Africa for stirring illustrations of black &#8220;achievement&#8221; in their native habitat.  Indeed, these two once-prosperous and beautiful countries are rapidly returning to a state of primitive tribal savagery under black control. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Once I thought we&rsquo;d head for space, but if <br>
our future is more Africans, I guess not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our race&rsquo;s Star Trek future will be eclipsed in a morass of welfare checks, futile attempts to educate the spawn of illegal immigrants, reparations payments, and section 8 housing. In 1960, White America was on a course to eradicate cancers and most diseases, build flying cars, colonize the moon, create technologies that would be beneficial to the whole world. Diversity will prove to be anything but strength as we waste the substance of our productive future on peoples who will not and can not contribute to a better future. </p>
<p>I think we are already seeing a slowing of progress as we face intractable problems that seem to remain continually unsolved. This country used to eradicate diseases with regularity, used to set itself enormous tasks and then perform them. Look at the Manhattan project. We put a man on the moon using vacuum tube technology but we can&rsquo;t cure cancer with microchips? We can&rsquo;t seem to solve our energy problems, but we can hand out rent vouchers with ruthless efficiency. Is it possible that the drag of these people on our society is already costing us that better future which seemed assured to us, just a few decades ago? <br>

DiMaggio, you are so right.  And it is not just the critical mass of 60 to 85 IQ people, it is the fact that affirmative action keeps the white 100 to 150 IQ people out of higher education and so many jobs and positions.</p>
<p>Affirmative action places people with 80 IQs in jobs that require 105 IQs and people with 90 IQs in jobs that require 120 IQs.  With such a critical mass of affirmative action incompetents in every  sector, things will inevetiably go downward.</p>
<p>When I worked in the county jail there was some sort of federally funded program to give jobs to people with degrees in psychology who were unemployable because a BA in psychology is totally useless in the job market.</p>
<p>So for a period of about 5 years every person who spent more than a couple days in the jail was given a battery of tests, including IQ tests.</p>
<p>Although our county had a black population of only 8 percent, about 99 percent of the persons in the jail, both the pre trial jail in the city and the big jail where they served sentences of up to one year, were of course black.</p>
<p>Turned out that virtually all the blacks tested had IQs in the 70&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s.  And I must say that the black women had IQs lower than the men, mostly in the 60&rsquo;s.  Of course most of the women were prostitutes, abused street prostitutes at that, and historically, street prostitutes under the control of vicious pimps and madams were retarded.</p>

<p>LIES can be defined as &#8220;inventions.&#8221; Maybe LIES are what the author of this garbage had in mind. I am not aware of ANY staggering scientific break-throughs by Blacks BEFORE 1865. This whole essay seems to be nothing more than to &#8220;excuse&#8221; the sociopathic tendencies of young Blacks, worldwide.\</p>
<p>As to &#8220;wasted potential,&#8221; these Blacks again have only themselves to blame. I am unaware of any evil White man holding a gun to the head of a Black juvenile, mouthing threats to kill him, if he dared get an education and from there, progress to a job.</p>
<p>But face reality, far too many Black youths, in the United States, in European nations, in Canada and Australia are just as failure-prone as those in the Carribean. In the United States, NO BLACK BORN AFTER 1965 HAS A VIABLE EXCUSE FOR FAILURE! Other than, of course, himself/herself!!! We taxpayers pay for and provide a public school system. A public school system which is not nearly as good as it could be&hellip; but again, primarily that being the FAULT OF BLACKS!!! Young Blacks being notorious for disruption of classes, for creating endless problems and refusing to apply themselves.</p>
<p>The truth Blacks of ANY age refuse to admit is that almost always, Blacks meeting the job&rsquo;s education and experience requirements has just as good a chance at landing it, as his or her White counterpart. With the Blacks often given the nod for sake of affirmative action. So WHAT, might we ask, is the real excuse for Black failure? Might it really be a genetic factor, as has been implied so many times by so many people? Something hardwired in the Black mind?</p>

<p>The only time in American history where that was even remotely close to true was that, antebellum, slave states severely restricted the educational opportunities of black slaves, in some cases, prohibited literacy education.  The reason was that the whites who ran these states knew of the tragedy of Haiti just decades earlier, and that their black slaves, with their relatively feeble mentalities, would be &#8220;educated&#8221; with violent, insurrectionist John Brown-ish agitprop.  Therefore, preventing them from learning how to read meant that the South didn&rsquo;t turn into Haiti.</p>

			<p>Pedro Noguera is  a  professor  in the  U.S., where  there  are  racial  and  ethnic problems  within  the  black  communities. In most  black  societies outside  of  the  U.S. &#8220;black boys&#8221;  have  no  more  problems  than  boys  in  Ireland,  Rumania, Russia, or  elsewhere.

<p>Black  boys  in countries other  than  the  U.S. for  the  most  part enjoy  their  youth by  going to  school, playing  sports and  engaging  in  activities  that  other  boys  do  worldwide.  </p>

			<p>Good point, QuestionDiversity, but I meant it in the context of the Barbados Blacks. As I was careful to point out, ANY Black in our country, who has the requisite education, background (experience and skills) has as good a chance of landing a coveted job as any White! Which is WHY I keep stressing, BLACKS HAVE ONLY THEMSELVES TO BLAME FOR THEIR FAILURES AND THEIR POVERTY!</p>
<p>As to that pathetic whiner, Matthew Farley, I can only point out he is only trying to excuse or justify his peoples&rsquo; inability to succeed. That Blacks are the cause of their own faiures has been demonstrated too many times in too many countries&hellip; including the African nations and the Carribean countries. As a Proud White American, I am &#8220;fed up&#8221; with Blacks always trying to scapegoat us Whites for the failure prone people they are.</p>

<p>Perhaps not. But I have personally met black boys who had to lead a double life. They had to play the shuck-and-jive mo-fo life in front of their so-called &#8220;peers&#8221; but were in fact studying hard in order to make something of themselves. Trust me: these kids DO exist.  They get the living c**p kicked out of them if there is any idea they are trying to &#8220;act white&#8221; by making something of themselves.</p>
<p>Sure, I am racially aware. But I also believe that when an INDIVIDUAL has potential it is a darn shame if he can&rsquo;t make use of it because he is in fear of his life.</p>
<p>As far a college admissions is concerned, I despise affirmative action in all forms. This includes the &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; that lets some dumb-bell white kid take the place of a smart ANY kid because the dumb-bell can throw a ball.<br>

			<p>The trouble with black boys&hellip; are black boys. No other explanation needed. They live in communities created by black boys and girls. They shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to go to school and emulate advanced civilization. They know this instinctively.  In Africa, men father many children with multiple women and women do most of the work. They are just recreating what they are hard wired to do. Don&rsquo;t blame them for who they are and don&rsquo;t blame others for blacks&rsquo; problems. Live and let live. But you all need to go back to Africa and start living in tribes again if you really want to be happy. Stop bothering other people with your problems!!</p>

<p>Occam continues to voice this canard, despite its frequent refutation here.

<p>I agree with that, especially since obviously high testerone white athletes have advanced degrees and are quite intellectual.  Klitchko the Russian heavyweight champ who was accepted into med school comes to mind.  There are thousands of others these last several years who excel intellectually, but, alas, no blacks.  None at all.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t believe it is testosterone that is responsible for low intelligence in blacks.  I believe it is the fact that they just haven&rsquo;t evolved as much as the rest of humanity, because they ARE the low men on the world&rsquo;s intellectual totem pole, so to speak.</p>

<p>Right on target. Productivity is an important measure of an economy and how successful it is. It measures the efficiency with which a group can turn resources and ideas into GDP. That efficiency is an important component in the development of spare capacity, excess wealth, time, all the things that are required for a culture to advance beyond its current point. We are setting ourselves up to regress to a point at which we cannot evolve further because we have artificially lowered our society&rsquo;s productivity with non-optimally performing human beings. If you let the janitor run logistics for the Mid-West, your company will be out of business soon. If you allow millions of janitors to work as accountants, lawyers, trade officials, judges, county commissioners, professors, administrators, and Congressmen, your society will soon be treading water.

<p>Which is exactly what lowering the bar for minorities (Blacks, Hispanics) is doing to us. That Black attorney-wannabe, in Houston two years ago. Griping the standards for passing the Bar exam were too high. Were effectively discriminatory against minorities. But this intellectual fly-weight could not grasp the basic premise that an attorney who COULD NOT UNDERSTAND the law, would hardly be qualified to represent his client   &mdash;   that a Black skin color was not enough.</p>
<p>When Priscilla Slade, regent of TSU in Houston was charged with misuse (theft) of nearly $200,000 in university funds&hellip; she hired herself the best criminal lawyer in Texas&hellip; who happened to be a White attorney, Dick Deguerrin. Now WHY would Slade not have hired herself a Black attorney, Slade being a Black woman? These anecdotes perfectly illustrate the folly of lowering standards, ostensibly to benefit minorities.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s true there may not be an exact correlation between high testosterone and low intelligence.  However, high testosterone levels do contribute to anger and the sex drive.  Angry, oversexed men often act out in antisocial ways and as well as engage in promiscuity, which correlates with more unwanted illegitimate babies.  Also, while a person is under the influence of emotions he is generally not thinking intellectual thoughts.</p>
<p>There are lots of good qualities to masculinity (bravery, physical strength, etc.) but there are some powerful negatives.  If only scientists could figure out just the right hormonal cocktail for men and women so we could operate at our optimum levels.</p>
