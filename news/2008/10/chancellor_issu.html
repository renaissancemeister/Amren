<h1><a href="http://www.du.edu/today/stories/2008/10/2008-10-20-boone.html">Chancellor Issues Decision on Student Effort to &lsquo;Bring Back Boone&rsquo;</a></h1>
 

<p>DU Today (Denver), October 20, 2008</p>

</div> 



<p>A student-initiated effort to replace Ruckus and reinstate Boone as the DU mascot has come to an end, Chancellor Robert Coombe announced today.</p>
<p>The decision comes after more than a year of consideration by University of Denver administration.</p>
<p>Boone was the University&rsquo;s mascot from 1968 &mdash; 98, when the pioneer character was replaced by Ruckus, a red-tailed hawk.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old Boone figure is one that does not reflect the broad diversity of the DU community and is not an image that many of today&rsquo;s women, persons of color, international students and faculty, and others can easily relate to as defining the pioneering spirit,&#8221; Coombe wrote in an Oct. 20 letter to students. &#8220;This runs counter to our commitment to build a diverse and inclusive campus community as a fundamental element of excellence. The University simply cannot adopt an official mascot that has a divisive rather than a unifying influence on our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The University will not use the image of Boone in any official manner, Coombe said, though students and alumni may continue to use the character in personal celebration of DU&rsquo;s history and tradition.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing is certain &mdash; we will always be the Pioneers,&#8221; Coombe wrote, adding that he&rsquo;d like the campus community to continue the discussion of &#8220;what it means to be a Pioneer, for today and the future.&#8221;</p>
