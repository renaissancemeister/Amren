<h1>Immigration Foe Makes Run at Lowey</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gerald McKinstry, Journal News (White Plains, New York), October 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>She&rsquo;s a 10-term incumbent with a $1.1 million war chest.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a semiretired computer consultant with $19,000 in campaign debt from previous races and a candidate for a congressional district that spans parts of Westchester and Rockland counties in which there are 72,000 more Democrats than Republicans.</p>
<p>So does Jim Russell, a conservative Republican running against Rep. Nita Lowey, D-Harrison, actually think he can win?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she might be surprised what people are saying,&#8221; Russell said last week in an interview with The Journal News. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a very unpredictable election season. If that picks up, there could be massive dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to supporting congressional term limits &mdash; a maximum of four terms &mdash; Russell, 54, is campaigning on immigration reform; eliminating earmarks, the so-called pork for &#8220;local pet projects&#8221;; and promoting renewable energy sources throughout the Lower Hudson Valley.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his third run for Congress. Russell was unsuccessful in securing the GOP line twice before, though he ran as a write-in two years ago after losing the Republican primary.</p>
<p>Lowey, 71, was first elected in 1988. She serves on the House Appropriations Committee and the House Homeland Security Committee, and she chairs the Appropriations subcommittee on state and foreign operations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Given the recent news of a $700 billion federal bailout of Wall Street, Russell wants a package that first guarantees retirement accounts for American workers and helps those who were victims of predatory lending. He&rsquo;s also calling for an investigation to find out how the situation spun out of control.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important is to guarantee the savings of working people,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Russell&rsquo;s central campaign issue is immigration reform, and he railed against what he perceived was Lowey&rsquo;s &#8220;unresponsiveness&#8221; to addressing it on a national level. A founder of Westchester-Rockland Citizens for Immigration Control and an author of a book on the issue, Russell said the matter affects many others including taxes, education and the economy.</p>
<p>He specifically wants those who are here illegally, particularly those who have been convicted of a crime, to be deported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immigration is out of control in the district,&#8221; Russell said. &#8220;She doesn&rsquo;t sense this as a pressing problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Russell is also against globalization because it&rsquo;s &#8220;bad for the American economy&#8221; and wants the North American Free Trade Agreement overturned because he thinks too many jobs have been lost by the initiative.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though Lowey and Russell found common ground in their support for developing renewable energy &mdash; wind, solar and other alternatives &mdash; they differ on Indian Point. He says it&rsquo;s unrealistic to close the nuclear power plant in Buchanan while she says it eventually should be closed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 18th District includes most of central and southern Westchester, from the Bronx line north to Ossining, and parts of the towns of Haverstraw and Clarkstown in Rockland.<br/>

			<p>Three cheers for Jim Russell.  I hope he is for real, and not a wannabe politician who found a great leverage issue.</p>

			<p>If I lived in Westchester, I would vote for him. He seems like an intelligent, non-marxist, environmentalist. His policies are very similar to the BNP. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Russell, 54, is campaigning on immigration reform; eliminating earmarks, the so-called pork for &ldquo;local pet projects&rdquo;; and promoting renewable energy sources throughout the Lower Hudson Valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is good news for Westchester County. In 2003 I experienced the intimidation of these people who use the government as their personal piggybank because I supported and pushed to button to get Republican Phil Amicone elected as Mayor. In 2004 I was verbally assaulted by one of Lowey&rsquo;s assistant&rsquo;s. While they use taxpayers money to finance the irresponsibility of some people/illegal aliens the retired-elderly American Citizens need to work for $7 an hour so that they can pay their property taxes&hellip;the highest in the nation. Dems control almost all of Westchester government and I know a thing or two about their scams in the name of the poor and disadvantaged. Run and let the chips fall where they may!</p>

			<p>I would encourage everyone here to give generously to Jim Russell. He is the only one out there fighting for us and it shouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a burden to donate $10 or $20.</p>
<p>His website is www.Russell2008.com</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s funny about Westchester is that is predominantly White and a nice area, but if you travel to the near by Bronx, it is predominantly non White, gang controlled, delapidated, and 30% of the people have an STD. I am sure the Whites in Westchester can see the difference quite easily. </p>
