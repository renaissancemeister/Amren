						<p>She&rsquo;s only 12 years old but Ashleigh Jones is feeling the heat of this election year. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the seventh grader at New Smyrna Beach Middle School was called a racist by classmates for wearing a pro-Sarah Palin t-shirt. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the students were calling me racist because I was Caucasian,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wanted the Caucasian man to win. And I told them that&rsquo;s not true. It&rsquo;s my freedom of speech, it&rsquo;s my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials with Volusia County Schools said there were no referrals or complaints to the office about this incident.</p>
<p>Ashleigh said that more of her friends are expressing their views by wearing political t-shirts and she plans to wear hers again. <br>

			<p>Go Ashleigh!!! So much for these concepts of tolerance the educational system prides themselves on teaching our youth.  Maybe it&rsquo;s a good thing little Ashleigh learns early, how intolerant those nice people on the left are.  If this concerned some little Black girl with an Obama shirt having a problem like this, it would be headlining the evening news.</p>

			<p>Whites are racist simply by fact that we breathe. It&rsquo;s a scientific fact as proven by Lewee Fakerman, Al Dullton and Jesse Jackyouup. And just think how much better it&rsquo;s gonna get after the African Messiah gets elected. To borrow the words of a lovely America loving African, &#8220;for the first time in my life I am really afraid for my country&#8221;&hellip;</p>

Again if you&rsquo;re black voting black you&rsquo;re supporting your people.<br>
And if you&rsquo;re white voting white you&rsquo;re a racist.</p>
<p>All these racial double standards are getting old.<br>

			<p>Gee, I wonder which of the kids were calling her racist and saying she wanted the Caucasians to win, because they are of her race?  Does anybody think it could be the darling little black children who are so tolerant, open-minded and well-behaved?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of what expect if that disgusting black racist gets in.  Every time one of his policies is voted down, anywhite not supporting it will be called racists by these types.</p>

			<p>The modern liberal public education brainwashing and indoctrination marxist centers have done their job well. A young white person simply shows up for school supporting their favorite presidential candidate and are immediately turned on by the brainwashed hordes and persecuted as a racist. Unbelievable but that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve allowed to happen in this country. If they had worn an Obama shirt they would have been hugged, accepted, and offered pot no doubt.</p>

			<p>I have a Sarah Palin t-shirt too; I bought it from Cafe Press.</p>
<p>Sarah Palin<br>
Beautiful<br>
Smart<br>
Conservative<br>
That makes two of us!</p>
<p>I always get looks when I wear it, but they aren&rsquo;t all bad looks. I got a lot of approving smiles, nods, thumbs up, and a high five when I wore it to the mall!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Officials with Volusia County Schools said there were no referrals or complaints to the office about this incident.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why not a full blown FBI investigation to find out why there were no &#8220;referrals or complaints,&#8221; about this &#8220;incident?&#8221; Why are these &#8220;officials&#8221; with the county schools not being pilloried publicly, for not doing enough to discourage on campus racial hatred and politically motivated intimidation; such inaction, indicates that it is unofficially sanctioned as being appropriate by them, doesn&rsquo;t it?  </p>
<p>Also, where are all those crackajack reporters from the New York Times and MSNBC hiding? Why are they not bringing to light for the whole country this atrocity?  </p>
<p>Is this what we call the sound of silence?</p>
<p>Next,</p>
<p>&#8220;Ashleigh said that more of her friends are expressing their views by wearing political t-shirts and she plans to wear hers again.&#8221; </p>
<p>Good for her, the best way to deal with Red and nonwhite intimidation artists (like all bullies) is to not only never back down, but get right in their ugly hateful faces and tell them where to, and how to get there. </p>
<p>Enough said, other then way to go Ashleigh!</p>

			<p>Even with a possible Obama presidency in our future whites are still being stereotyped as being racist. What is it that the left hates about Sarah Palin.Is it her middleclassness I think.That a white middleclass women could end up govenor of a state with afirmative action in the way really angers blacks.Same thing applys to Joe the Plumber. They  just cannot handle us uppity white folk. We should just be quiet while we are robbed, raped and murdered by blacks.</p>

			<p>The charge of racism so terribly easy to raise and for all intents and purposes impossible to refute.  Indeed, protestations to the contrary makes a bad situation worse.</p>
<p>So, whenever I&rsquo;m accused of being one I quote a landsmann of mine, Simon (aka St. Peter) that, since I&rsquo;ve reached the age of reason I&rsquo;ve tried not to call any man &#8216;common or unclean.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>Poor kid, her mother never informed her that blacks hate whites, so this was a shock to the poor little one. But now she knows, blacks are ignorant and whiners&hellip;..little Ashleigh has learned a valuable lesson, now she needs to say back to the blacks&hellip;..I&rsquo;m not a racist, I&rsquo;m a realist, do you know the difference?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong.  No one has had to teach non-whites to hate us.  They&rsquo;ve <i>always</i> hated us.  Where the marxists have succeeded is making <i>voicing</i> that sentiment permissible and <i>encourage</i> voicing it.  With that in hand, it&rsquo;s a blame-whitey, hate-whitey free-for-all.</p>

			<p>This is exciting!!</p>
<p>Young White people are becoming racially aware, not in theory but in daily life; reality is raising its head. They are talking, they are feeling, they are seeing the racism of others even though the white girls did nothing to provoke the racists.</p>
<p>The attempted destruction of Governor Palin by the Blacks and Hispanics is NOT about politics or Governors Palin&rsquo;s personal beliefs, but about uniting and invigorating White Men and Women to realize their potential, their leadership, there distinctive ability to make progress. THIS frightens people of any color not White.</p>
<p>Through the Education of publications like Amren, Occidental, and Barnes Review, perhaps the new White generation will become aware of race and with knowledge will create NEW and FRESH leadership that will actually gather Whites that can actually accomplish something and we can then move forward.</p>
<p>No revolution can come before its time, and at the right time Real Leadership will rise to the call. The NEW Ruling Elite will move forward and the masses will conform and follow.</p>
<p>These small incidents of unprovoked racism are shadows and seeds of greater things to come.</p>

			<p>Called her a racist?  Oh, the poor thing!  A fate worse than debt!</p>
<p>How many times have I read that phrase, &#8220;for fear of being called a racist&#8221; on this site?  Hundreds.  For heaven&rsquo;s sake, people, it&rsquo;s just a word.  Embrace it.  It has no more power than you give it.  As long as you back down from every confrontation at the mention of the word, it will be used for that purpose; and you have nobody to blame but yourselves, because you have given your enemies that power.</p>
<p>I would have thought that after all these years, its potency would have become blunted.  But here the American people (present company excepted, of course) seem determined to commit national suicide just to gain absolution from the charge. It scares me to death.  White people, worldwide, need to grow a backbone, and there&rsquo;s not much time.</p>

			<p>The whole answer to this issue of folks screaming &#8220;racist!&#8221; is to reply &#8220;and&hellip;?&#8221; </p>
<p>The problem, as I see it, is ALLOWING others to shut us up by use of that word. Just don&rsquo;t shut up.  Just use a disarming reply. &#8220;and&hellip;?&#8221;  &#8220;Your point being&hellip; what?&#8221;</p>
<p>(I for one am not a racist; I tend to take folks individually. But I am far from stupid: I won&rsquo;t get off the freeway in East St Louis to ask directions or buy gas, nor would I do that in Gary Indiana. In short: tolerant, yes; stupid, no).</p>

			<p>Resurrected Calvinism here. Interesting how ideas like this come back in new dress. Predestined: Whites can&rsquo;t win. Heresy to think otherwise. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do, you&rsquo;re damned. Liberals should get the message: appeasement is irrelevant. Even Ashleigh unconsciously buys into it, denying she wants the Caucasian to win. God (or fate) chooses you to lose and nothing you can do can change your destiny, but go through the empty motions.</p>
<p>Whites needs to throw out baggage in our collective psychology that may have worked in past, but now used against us. We need to ask fundamental questions. Who are we? Why are we here? What&rsquo;s special about us? Where have we been? Where are we going? Otherwise we&rsquo;ll be trapped into thinking in the categories of those who want to displace us.</p>
<p>One example of a fundamental question is: what&rsquo;s better to think in the long term or the short term? In general, I think, it&rsquo;s better to think in short term. The chain of cause and effect is so complex and far reaching that the end result is unpredictable as to whether a political action will cause more or less suffering; the short term consequences are more foreseeable; better stick to what&rsquo;s safe, the bird in the hand. But the Multiculturists use this sound argument to shut up White criticism of Multiculturism saying it&rsquo;s divisive, someone may get hurt from the resulting social conflicts. They may or may not be right, but what they miss is that there are times when the issue is of such overriding importance, that the short term should be damned, what&rsquo;s more important is the long term issue, namely the very survival of a people, the White Race. Wars, Famines, pestilence can be recovered from, not extinction of a people.</p>
<p>Another fundamental question is: what&rsquo;s more important winning or compassion? Someone once told me it&rsquo;s nice to be important, but it&rsquo;s more important to be nice. I believe that, especially at a social level. But you have to win to be compassionate, in the sense you have to maintain yourself at a certain level of secure strength to be able to give out of your excess. If Whites ever became weak in a &#8220;multicultural&#8221; world, the only relation we could have to others is to &#8216;beg for mercy&rsquo;. Compassion for non-Whites would be an irrelevant fantasy. Compassion has it&rsquo;s place, but we can&rsquo;t give away the store.</p>
<p>In short, wisdom or the truths we live by can&rsquo;t be separated from the historial situation. </p>

			<p>Middle school kids often have heads full of emotionally charged mush and, it&rsquo;s typical of many black and, hispanic kids (and even whites as well) to shout racism and, racist as a way to bash someone they don&rsquo;t like. All you need to do is demand what they mean by racism, or ask them what it means. Their faces often draw a blank stare.</p>
<p>If you let the insult racist have meaning to you, or accept the hurlers meaning, then they&rsquo;ve won. </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s disturbing is that so many &#8220;adults&#8221; in the US, &amp; the world for that matter, still think &amp; behave in much the same way.  And, oh yeah, they get to vote, what a great idea that is.</p>

			<p>  It is Senator Obama and his liberal cohorts who have always played the race card. They try to portray any questioning of Obama&rsquo;s past associations and former life as racism. Now it appears that even a young girl&rsquo;s support of Sarah Palin (hunter and mother of five) is racism. I fully expect &#8220;hate speech&#8221; legislation after Obama and the far left Democratic Congress convene in January.</p>

			<p>I wish all the Caucasian students in protest would either march outside the school or all would wear Palin shirts.  This is another case of black on white oppression, intimidation, and threats of violence.  But the poor black racist can&rsquo;t help it since they are too blindly stupid and racist to help themselves.</p>

			<p>I look forward to 4 years of Obama.  It&rsquo;s a slap in the face America needs.  It will be just as someone mentioned earlier, anyone who doesn&rsquo;t back measures Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;crew&#8221; puts up will be demonized as &#8220;racist&#8221;.  </p>
<p>This will start happening with such frequency that all of America will get a national look at how far the race card has come.  And they won&rsquo;t like what they see.  Even liberal pockets who scream for diversity but don&rsquo;t actually practice it will be disgusted by it.  </p>
<p>What we Americans will finally learn is that blacks scream racism, so we react by giving them what they want.  Then they scream Racism.  So we give them more.  When this finally hits national saturation I think we&rsquo;ll see a shift.</p>

			<p>A schizophrenic cocktail of politics, racism, and racial terrorism constantly ebbs and flows  within cities and towns throughout America when multiculturalism catches up with white areas not exposed to its natural deception.<br>
Many white towns sit naive and barely aware that the pinnacles of a healthy environment-their enviroment are working to be subjugated when homosexuals, feminists, and counterculturaists, enter into small businesses and dictate new fashion trends in music and clothing to later enter into local schools and government ushering in multiracialism and racial terrorism once the will of the people has been broken.<br>
Multiracialism is a disease which begins to spread on the street.<br>
If local areas are not aware of it it eventually begins to spread.<br>
Most people are unaware that multiculturalism is a form of guerilla warfare which is defined as a political war when the target objective is the human being or political animal as defined by Aristotle and whose mind must be reached to be defeated without necessarily receiving bullets. <br>
during the Reagan years the CIA instituted a Clandestine operations procedure for the take down of Socialist governments in Central America which proved successful.<br>
What everyday American&rsquo;s do not yet know is that those same procedures most likely may be used is cities already heavily saturated in the future even if other situations affecting smaller towns are resolved.<br>
Hopefully, white towns will begin to wake up to the urgency of the matter so that all American&rsquo;s can maintain their own beliefs without becoming the victims of racial terrorism.<br>

			<p>One of the best ways to turn the tables on somebody who makes accusations of &#8216;racism&rsquo; is to accuse them of being a &#8216;witchhunter.&rsquo; Because that is exactly what these leftists are - modern day witchhunters - despite their self-image as highly educated, tolerant paragons of virtue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ashleigh said that more of her friends are expressing their views by wearing political t-shirts and she plans to wear hers again.&#8221; </p>
<p>For years now I have been wearing t-shirts with &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221; messages on them in order to irritate our enemies and the dumb sheeple out there.  It&rsquo;s my own, personal &#8220;ice front&#8221; against third world invaders and one in which I wish more Whites would emulate.</p>

<p>The dirty looks I get from non-Whites doesn&rsquo;t bother me in the slightest.  What aggravates my soul are the nervous and cowardly looks I get from other Whites. </p>
<p>&#8220;The coward calls himself cautious.&#8221; - Publilius Syrus: Sententiae, c. 50 B.C. </p>

			<p>Some of the students were calling me racist because I was Caucasian,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wanted the Caucasian man to win. And I told them that are not true. It&rsquo;s my freedom of speech, it&rsquo;s my opinion.&rdquo;<br>
Am I correct to assume these student brutes are not Caucasian? Who authorized the canalization of Blacks as &ldquo;gods&rdquo; who are to be worship and never questioned, two sources come to mind; the corrupt Government and the Black fascists.</p>
<p>This condition came from the mind control of 45 years by the regulator of the white race: (TV radio, magazines) who placed a mark into the minds of white people that must adhere to the doctrines presented by the Marxist left. </p>
<p>This is 12 year old white girl who cannot vote and if she feels that she wants a Caucasian to win, all the better, she need to tell these thugs to jump off a bridge.</p>
<p>What is occurring in this country to the white population is a pogrom to destroy our race, we need to become combative or we wont survive. </p>

			<p>H. Dumpty,</p>
<p>When blogging, I&rsquo;m sure we all are called racists for laying out facts regarding racial double standards.  I like your sarcastic response to lefties attempts at silencing you.  My response of choice when called a racist is:  &#8221;Umm&hellip;..Ok.  So now that you have the name-calling out of your system, lets discuss facts&#8221;.  I then go from there and give it to them good.  Once we&rsquo;ve brushed aside and rendered ineffective their *Saul Alinsky-inspired use of &#8221;ridicule&#8221; as a tactic to silence us, their argument falls apart rather quickly.  Facts are on our side, while their side is left with regurgitating the same old politically correct cliches and slogans that even THEY find hard to defend with any level of believability.</p>
<p>* See Rule #5 in Saul Alinsky&rsquo;s book, &#8221;Rules for Radicals&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The 7th grader should&rsquo;ve let them know that white (Palin) is right, and black (Obama)is whack.</p>
<p>This position was taken as a given 50 years ago, and should continue to be taken as given now and in the future.</p>

			<p>If you are white you must be a racist, Me and two of my friends here in South Africa have actually stolen an idea from the American blacks, we now use the word Racist to greet each other, thereby breaking the power of the word. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Up  Racist? How are you Racist? Good and yourself Racist.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;&ldquo;&rsquo;or fear of being called a racist&rsquo; on this site? Hundreds. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, people, it&rsquo;s just a word. Embrace it. It has no more power than you give it&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in these totalitarian times, that word DOES have a lot of power  &mdash;  the power to end jobs and careers, to wipe out one&rsquo;s pension and life savings and to possibly put oneself and loved ones in harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>Are you willing to risk that?</p>
<p>Most of us have jobs where accusations of &#8216;racism&rsquo; would end one&rsquo;s career as it did for Trent Lott and Fuzzy Zoeller  &mdash;  or deal a huge blow as it did to Don Imus. Remember:  blacks and other non-Whites are free to spew hatred and invective towards Whites with impunity.</p>
<p>This is what we&rsquo;ve come to in 2008 America  &mdash;  Freedom of Speech for Whites is gone and with an obama presidency, the accusations and prosecutions will continue apace, with vengence.  If ANY White criticizes anything obama says or does he will be axiomatically accused of racism.</p>
<p>How soon do you think it will be before the Fairness Doctrine is shoved through congress and talk radio is destroyed?</p>
<p>How soon before AmRen is labeled a pro-White, neo-Nazi Hate Site and shut down?</p>
<p>1984 is here, a little late, but here and Big Brother will be marking your words.</p>

			<p>This is pretty normal behavior for 12 year olds. <br>
What&rsquo;s disturbing is that so many &ldquo;adults&rdquo; in the US, &amp; the world for that matter, still think &amp; behave in much the same way.<br>

How do young school kids get notions like this? They don&rsquo;t know soup from nuts except for what they&rsquo;re told.</p>
<p>As was admonished by  Max Horkheimer (founder of The Frankfurt School), <i> &#8220;When it comes to propaganda, always maintain tight control of the terminology.&#8221;  </i></p>
<p>And the Left always does.  Politicians use it. The media use it.  Even the right wing unwittingly uses it.  Everyone uses it. Unless we consciously resist, we&rsquo;re reduced to using the propaganda terms that the left has coined for us and has put into our mouths. How can anyone think objectively when we are using the &#8220;bad&#8221; words and the &#8220;good&#8221; words that they have given us and allow us to use?</p>
