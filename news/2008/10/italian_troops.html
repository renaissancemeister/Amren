	<p>Italian troops manned checkpoints and checked vehicles as they deployed Saturday in a crime-ridden, mob-plagued southern area of the country where six Africans were gunned down last month.</p>
<p>The 500 soldiers deployed in and around Caserta, a small town near Naples. The Camorra organized crime syndicate is based in the area.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Sept. 18 gangland-style shooting of the Africans sparked rioting in an area already rife with lawlessness and violence. Police believe the Camorra orchestrated the slayings to punish the Africans for getting involved in drug trafficking, one of its lucrative activities.</p>
<p>As the troops deployed, thousands of immigrants and other people marched through the streets of Caserta to defend the immigrants&rsquo; rights and demand that they be protected from racists and mobsters alike.

<p>Here&rsquo;s just another one of thousands of examples that blacks bring down the societies wherever the flee to, either through incompetence or a propensity for crime.</p>
<p>The consevative Italian honcho should investigate the situation to find out who is DIRECTLY responsible for bringing in African primitives and then incarcerate them for life without parole, requiring that they spend all their time with blacks.</p>

			<p>Defending your own economic interests is always &#8216;racism,&rsquo; even if your occupation is illegal. Yet whites are expected to tear each other limb from limb. </p>
<p>The only thing you can do is give blacks you house, your wife, you car, and your paycheck, and then you become &#8216;enlightened.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>I love the following line:</p>
<p>&#8220;As the troops deployed, thousands of immigrants and other people marched through the streets of Caserta to defend the immigrants&rsquo; rights and demand that they be protected from racists and mobsters alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>What &#8220;other people&#8221; were marching with these Africans?  Communists, perhaps?</p>
<p>Neither the Camorra or the African &#8220;immigrants&#8221; elicit any sympathy from me.  I feel sorry for the locals who have to endure both.  There&rsquo;s really only one way to deal with all these &#8220;immigrants&#8221;: deport them.  There&rsquo;s also really only one way to deal with gangsters, as the late William Sleeman &amp; Cesare Mori would attest to if they were still with us.  Unfortunately, that is impossible in today&rsquo;s politically correct climate of &#8220;civil rights.&#8221;</p>

<p><br>
The African immigrants&rsquo; &#8220;rights&#8221;? Precisely which &#8220;rights&#8221; would those be, pray tell?</p>
<p>The &#8220;right&#8221; to live in a country not of their birth? No such right. </p>
<p>The &#8220;right&#8221; to deal narcotics? No such right. </p>
<p>The right to mess with the Mafia and not risk reprisals? No such right. </p>
<p>All criminal-minded African parasites out of white countries NOW!<br>

			<p>Close attention should be paid to the fact that troops, not police, were deployed.  There is a significant difference between the two.  Police maintain the peace and enforce the law.  Troops wage war.</p>
<p>These people best be very careful and would be well advised to leave Italy as soon as possible.  Manipulations like calling those who want immigrants out of their country, &#8220;racists&#8221; may work with public sentiment and even courts of law.  But what the Italian government is signaling is that they are through argueing the matter and are ready to start shooting..</p>
<p>It would only take a relatively minor incident for Italy to decide to simply expel all the problem people.  If they met significant resistance, they would probably kill as many as it would take to break that resistance. Not that it would matter, but I get the feeling that the average Italian would be all for that, considering how much they have suffered from what amounts to a hostile alien invasion.  I say, not that it matters because clearly Italy has moved beyond anything having to do with the rule of law and is focussed on problem solving.</p>
<p>That has the potential to return Italy to fascism as a way of solving these problems.  It seems to me that the European Union is very close to first, financial, and then, social collapse.  I think, if (or more realistically, when) that happens, fascism is spread across europe.</p>
<p>Based on what has been going on the last decade or so, that may not be a bad thing.  Democracy is the most ideal form of government but it requires that the average citizen exercise clear mindedness and responsibility.  In europe and in much of the US, the average citizen has largely failed in that responsibility.  Because of that, democracy has largely lost its ability to maintain its basic function of protecting society.  It&rsquo;s become near suicidal in the face of very real, very dangerous enemies.  Corruption has rotted it away at its roots&hellip;.the people who make up the democracy.  It&rsquo;s so weak that it&rsquo;s collapsing, in europe.  And what we see here in Italy is the first signs that it will be replaced by simple fact that it no longer does its basic function.</p>
<p>Or put another way.  If elected officials fail to pass and enforce laws that keep an enemy army from simply moving in next door to their intended victims, don&rsquo;t be surprised when war breaks out and both laws and elected officials become irrelevent.</p>
<p>That is europe&rsquo;s future and perhaps America&rsquo;s as well.</p>

<p>  So it&rsquo;s racist if they cannot take over mafia territory<br>
for their &#8220;immigrant&#8221; criminal syndicate. So they a riot and<br>
have a little march. Do they really think the mafia is going <br>

			<p>Kick their racist african butts out!!  Those racist africans have no right invading and killing Europeans.  Europe is sovereign.  Africans need more rubbers and fewer children and need to learn to live within the resources God gave them.  Stay out of Europe is my advice to the black people.  You are not welcomed and even hated.  Americans can witness to what I say as it is the truth so help me God.</p>

<p>Europeans should have learned from the USA about blacks but they were too naive and arrogant to do so. They thought that America&rsquo;s problems with blacks stemmed from evil white american racism and that things would be different with blacks in europe because they(europeans) were such tolerant people. Unfortunatly, area of europe that have gotten blacks are learning the hard way.</p>

			<p>This reminds me of The Camp of the Saints where the French military was used to aid the immigrant invasion, rather than put a stop to it.</p>
<p>Instead of holding up a banner that read &ldquo;United against the Camorra and racism&rdquo; in the novel, the self-hating Westerners held up banners that read &#8220;We are all from the Ganges.&#8221;</p>

			<p>An apparent cold-blooded massacre of six individuals is of course to be regretted, but the spin intially put on the story by the media - that this was a purely racially motivated attack - appears to be wrong, and the motive appears to be criminal activity related to drug trafficking.<br>
 Another unfortunate fact ppears to be black Africans, once given refuge from their own wretched lands and having their &#8216;feet under the table&rsquo; revert to type and soon become involved in all the nastiness that society throws up ie drugs,robbery,theft,prostitution etc.</p>

			<p><i>Close attention should be paid to the fact that troops, not police, were deployed.</i></p>
<p>My guess is that the police were not deployed because they are almost entirely in the pay of the Camorra, including both the local police and even elements of the national Carabinieri.  In fact, many of these Africans are in the pay of the Camorra as well, according to Americans I know who are living in Italy   &mdash;   willing associates who sell oddly identical trinkets on the streets of Italian cities everywhere, yet, somehow, never get picked up by the police despite their illegal presence and activities!  The protection money doesn&rsquo;t stop just at the Camorra, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>Also, I find it very disturbing of all that there are &#8220;thousands&#8221; of immigrants to take to the streets of Caserta, which is one of the poorer towns in Italy.  There aren&rsquo;t even jobs enough for the Italians who live there, yet thousands of Africans are moving there.  Very strange times we live in.</p>

			<p>The underlying message seems to be  &mdash;  It&rsquo;s okay for White mobsters to wack other white mobsters, and it&rsquo;s okay for black immigrants to move to Italy, get involved in the drug trade, and even get territorial over turf that isn&rsquo;t their own, though heaven forbid some of these drug trafficking African mobsters, get wacked in the process. They are special and need to be protected. This world is going insane.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s racist if they cannot take over mafia territory<br>
for their &ldquo;immigrant&rdquo; criminal syndicate. So they a riot and<br>
have a little march. Do they really think the mafia is going <br>
to just cede their turf to them,out of fear of being called racist ?<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
African immigrants in Europe have learned that it pays to copy their black cousins in America, and break out in riots whenever they are displeased with anything. They also have grown to think that by shouting the word RACIST, whites will instantly back-down with their tails tucked between their legs. Look at the world we live in today, Blacks are slaughtering Whites in Zimbabwe and South Africa in countries whites colonized and built centuries ago, and their reasoning is because they are not indigenous to the land, they have every right to drive them out, kill them, and claim everything they toiled for. Does this cause interntational outrage? Not in the least! In fact, western nations continue to bail them out with economic relief. In the mean time, more and more Africans are swarming over Europe, and having everything handed to them at the expense of tax payers dollars. They have grown cocky, and this has emboldened them all the more. Even though they know their own people have never accomplished what whites have throughout the years, they view whites as weak and easily exploitable. It rocks their world these days, when whites actually find the backbone to stand up to them. They simply can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>

			<p>I watched the African&rsquo;s demonstration on TV - there were only Africans and no &#8220;other people.&#8221; One of the Africans was interviewed and he screamed something like this : &#8220;We&rsquo;ll fight back, if we have to we&rsquo;ll go house to house and kill Italians!&#8221; Can you believe these people they go to a country that&rsquo;s not theirs and then they have demands and threaten the local people. The police should have just went to the demonstration and check their papers, they were probably illegals. Another interview was with some local Italians and one girl said &#8220;The mafia never makes mistakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The depths in which the Italian drug traffickers went to seize control of their drug trafficking operations, by killing black drug dealers,highlights the depths which blacks will go to subvert and destroy white society, even as immigrants.<br>

			<p>Yes, I agree Italian military units should use full force, war to fight back the invaders. But before the tanks open fire (get Russian or Serb tank commanders) let&rsquo;s hope the Bono, Sting, Madonna, Brat Pitt - the Obamanation and many other Harvard Law grad, &#8220;Community Organizers&#8221; can be brought in to mediate the situation, get kidnapped, raped and tortured by the Black Africans (same as happened in Camp of the Saints) and then pass away in mass bombings. </p>

shoes: they have the Cosa Nostra. Criminals? Sure, but also <br>

it&rsquo;s how they started. If they have decided to act against the<br>
Africans, then Italy  will be saved. Because this means that<br>

			<p>&#8220;thousands of immigrants  <b>and other people  </b>marched through the streets of Caserta  <b>to defend the immigrants&rsquo; rights  </b>and demand that they be protected from racists and mobsters alike. A huge banner at the demonstration said: &ldquo;United against the Camorra and racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And &#8220;other people&#8221;???  Now who could that be, I wonder? </p>
<p>Hint: When you see any banner including the word &#8220;racism&#8221;, no matter what the issue is otherwise, it&rsquo;s a sure sign that it&rsquo;s been organized by the ultra-left.  <br>
Primitive African &#8220;immigrants&#8221; don&rsquo;t get together and organize themselves this way.  <br>
And by the way, just what are those &#8220;immigrant rights&#8221; that they are demanding?  (&#8220;Rights&#8221; = another giveaway code word of the Left.)<br>

<p>Do you think these iliterate, confused immigrants know anything about the American &#8220;Civil Rights Struggle&#8221;? Do they know anything about community organizing and planning demonstrations? </p>
<p>They are being used now as battering rams to break down European society   &mdash;    just as the blacks in America were ALWAYS targeted as useful tools (by Marxists) to attack and break down American society.</p>

			<p>Close attention should be paid to the fact that troops, not police, were deployed.  Police maintain the peace and enforce the law. Troops wage war. &hellip; what the Italian government is signaling is that they are through argueing the matter and are ready to start shooting.. It would only take a relatively minor incident &hellip; If they met significant resistance, they would probably kill as many as it would take to break that resistance.<br>
7:50PM<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>This may well be so.  Or maybe not.  It is unclear, from reading the story, just WHO would be the object of those bullets.  As other posters here have stated in the past, the English, French and Dutch authorities would rather order the police/soldiers to mow down their own people first, before they would  tolerate harm to any of their precious immigrants. After all (as they all learn in school) whites and &#8220;xenophobes&#8221; are always wrong, and immigrants are NEVER wrong.   I can&rsquo;t say how brainwashed are the Italians. Hopefully less.</p>
<p>However, as poster Bristow says:  <i>&#8220;This reminds me of The Camp of the Saints where the French military was used to aid the immigrant invasion, rather than put a stop to it.&#8221; </i>  I just hope not in this case.</p>
<p>And if it did happen, as 7:50 speculates, that the immigrants were attacked, there would be howls of outrage from the UN, the EU, and even the USA, plus the entire world community. Probably the EU and  NATO would step in to intervene  (  &mdash;   and we know on which side). </p>
<p>Just look at what was done to &#8220;discipline&#8221; little Serbia, bombed for 78 days:   <br>
&#8220;NATO&rsquo;s bombing campaign lasted from March 24 to June 11, 1999, involving up to 1,000 aircraft operating mainly from bases in Italy and the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt stationed in the Adriatic Sea. Tomahawk cruise missiles were also extensively used, fired from ships and submarines. <b>The United States was, inevitably, the dominant member of the coalition against Serbia,</b> although all of the NATO members were involved to some degree  &mdash;  even Greece, despite publicly opposing the war. During the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions.&#8221;<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly call the anarachy that took place during Katrina an American &#8220;Civil Rights Struggle&#8221;, nor is overturning cars, or breaking windows, in Naples, exactly what I would term &#8220;A carefully planned or organized demonstration&#8221;. All-over Europe these days, when African immigrants get angry, they resort to the same level of violence, and chaos we have witnessed in America for decades now. It happens all the time in France, and quite frequently in the UK! And will likely spread and escalate through-out most of Europe, unless something is done. </p>
<p>I refuse to dismiss these violent immigrants as mere tools and puppets. They also knew exactly what they were doing by involving themselves in drug trafficking and prostitution. </p>
<p>That hardly means I dismiss Europes Marxist government for their role in this, they are allowing more and more of them to enter, both legally and illegally, without cracking down on them. While the liberal media also paints them as victims of racism, rather than as the criminals they truly are. </p>
<p>The Governement and media are hugely responsible for the problem no doubt. If they were to crack down on them, and not allow them in the country in the first place, this problem would not exist, on that we can agree! But don&rsquo;t think for a minute these African thugs don&rsquo;t know what they are doing!</p>

When it is a true demonstration, with blacks and white alike, involved marching and carrying signs? Then naturally, left-wing organizers are usually behind it. But when it involves riots, and violence? Blacks from Africa, are no different than their brethren in America, and most will do what comes naturally. Having seen news images of this event, I noticed, that while most were black, a good deal of them were also non-white, with many of them appearing to be Middle Eastern, and Asian, and a smattering of the usual liberal white lemmings. Other immigrants have good reason to get behind this (so-called) demonstration, since they too, want to protect their legal status in Italy. But most of what has followed has not been peaceful in the least, which is why they are involving the military. As another poster here pointed out, one African informed the media, that if they didn&rsquo;t get their way, they would break into the homes of citizens and kill them! These so-called poor, illiterate, primitive Africans, most of whom are illegal, are making some equally primitive threats! All the more reason to deport every last one of them!</p>

			<p>When signor Bossi or one of his men in the Italian parliament recently called for the machine-gunning of illegal immigrants entering Italian waters, it seemed to be a drastic solution. But looking at how these immigrants behave on Italian soil with threats of murdering Italians, that call now seems almost reasonable.</p>

That&rsquo;s a good point too. Let&rsquo;s remember that there were Chinese demonstrations in Milan just a few months ago. Probably each group observes and learns from another.</p>
<p>Incidentally, someone above said he didn&rsquo;t see many whites (at least on TV). Might it be possible that sympathetic film crews did not show whites   &mdash;   or the TV stations later edited out scenes with whites?  You can&rsquo;t entirely trust what you see on TV;  it is possible to be very slective with a camera. Just another point.</p>
<p>And no matter what the Africans do, whether they&rsquo;re the organizers of the demonstrstions or the naive tools of others, the Left (and that means the media) is always going to present blacks as victims. That&rsquo;s the only way their mental framework allows them to see it.</p>

<p>I think plenty here are aware of the insidious socialist plot that most Marxists favor. That being said, Blacks are not always just helpless victims, and tools, even though they love to depict themselves that way, since they never want to take responsiblity for thier own criminal ways. But they should be held accountable for their own actions. The LA riots, Detroit riots, Katrina looting and violence, are perfect examples of spontainious black erruptions of violence, which were neither planned nor orchestrated. It is simply a part of their true violent nature. It is bad enough Americans are forced to cope with it. But there is no reason Italians, and most Europeans should need to. These are immigrants, who can&rsquo;t use the usual song and dance routine, about having their ancestors dragged there against their will. They came there on their own, and Italians have the right to throw them out.</p>
