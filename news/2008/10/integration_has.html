<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Meredith Brace of San Diego, California, believes in integration. She lived in a largely white area, but the neighborhood school, Harding Elementary, was 90 percent Hispanic. She was convinced whites should go to Harding rather than escape to a white school. Even before her son was old enough to enroll, she joined the PTA, raised money for Harding, and went door-to-door to promote it to white neighbors. She became president of the PTA and held neighborhood meetings to encourage whites to attend. After her son started going, she set up after-school art and theater classes to bring whites and Hispanics together. They failed because not enough people signed up. </p>
<p>She kept her son at Harding for three years before finally giving up. &ldquo;[W]e have nothing in common [with Hispanics],&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Every time my husband and I would go over for an event, my husband would feel like it was his first time. We haven&rsquo;t made any friends.&rdquo; Her son made no friends either. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been invited to a birthday party,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;There is absolutely no after-school interaction. For his birthday, he invited four of his classmates. Only one came.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mrs. Brace finally joined the neighbors she had tried so hard to convince to go to Harding. Saying she could no longer treat her son like a guinea pig, she transferred him to Hope Elementary School, which was still 73 percent white. As one white parent explained, &ldquo;[I]f half of [the neighborhood] is going in that direction, maybe we can carpool.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It is lunch time at the Westerly Hills Elementary School in Charlotte, North Carolina. Black and white children sit next to each other in what seems to be complete disregard for race. The school appears to have passed what educators call the &ldquo;lunchroom litmus test,&rdquo; of whether children make friends across racial lines. But the test is rigged. The children at Westerly Hills have assigned seats; that is the only way to get blacks and whites to eat together. </p>
<p>Columbia, Maryland, was founded in 1967 as a planned community of up-scale homes, where blacks and whites would live together in harmony. It considered itself a model for the country, and in the 1970s prospective home buyers were proudly told that Columbia&rsquo;s first baby was born to a mixed-race couple. The town attracted people with an unusual commitment to integration and racial equality, but by the 1990s, blacks and whites had drifted apart. Residents noted that self-segregation was most pronounced among children and teenagers. </p>
<p>Integration is clearly not progressing as Americans in the 1960s expected it to. Two full generations have been reared with the ideals of racial equality, and yet racial separation is almost as pervasive today as it was 40 or more years ago. </p>
<p>Integration was the cornerstone of America&rsquo;s great campaign for racial equality. It was the goal of sit-ins, Freedom Riders, demonstrations, and civil disobedience. It was sought with equal enthusiasm by blacks and white liberals alike. For those who were crafting a new racial future, integration was to be the first step towards realizing America&rsquo;s full democratic potential. It was the decisive first step towards a future in which race would cease to matter. </p>
<p>Today, almost no one talks about integration. Partly, that is because the civil rights struggle completely destroyed segregation, removing all legal barriers to integration. Every law Martin Luther King ever hoped for has been passed, and governments at all levels devote enormous efforts to rooting out any remaining vestiges of racial discrimination. </p>
<p>A more significant reason why few people talk about integration is that there is not much of it to talk about. Voluntary, widespread racial mixing is rare. In law and in theory, race not only does not matter, it is forbidden that it matter. In practice, race is a prominent and persistent social barrier. There has been no official declaration of defeat, but the failure of integration underlines just how far from realization is the dream that inspired the racial activists of the middle of the last century. Some Americans live in broadly diverse settings, but far more do not. </p>
<p>Integration was of enormous symbolic importance for two reasons. First, segregation was the clearest possible expression of racial inequality. Many Americans came to believe it was unconscionable to shut out anyone because of something so meaningless as race. But abolishing legal segregation was only the first step. True integration was the key to unblocking the entire racial log-jam, to making the races equal in every respect. </p>
<p>Half a century after the confident predictions of the 1960s, it is high time to review the record. If integration has not been made to work  &mdash;  much less unblock the log-jam  &mdash;  what will? If integration was expected to come smoothly, yet fails to materialize generation after generation, what does that say about the assumptions of the civil rights movement? If race still matters after 50 years of campaigning, when will it cease to matter? </p>
<p>Theory of Integration </p>
<p>The theoretical basis for integration was established in An American Dilemma, written in 1944 by the Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal. With the possible exception of Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin, no other book has even approached its influence on American thinking about race. An American Dilemma went through 25 printings  &mdash;  an astonishing record for a dense, thousand-page work of sociology  &mdash;  before it went into a second, &ldquo;twentieth anniversary&rdquo; edition in 1962. It set contours for the debate about race that have lasted virtually unchanged until our own day. </p>
<p>One of the book&rsquo;s key passages explains why integration is the essential first step to solving the &ldquo;American dilemma:&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;White prejudice and discrimination keep the Negro low in standards of living, health, education, manners and morals. This, in its turn, gives support to white prejudice. White prejudice and Negro standards thus mutually &lsquo;cause&rsquo; each other.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This was the heart of the problem: Whites despised blacks and kept them in an artificially inferior position. Whites then pointed to this apparent inferiority as justification for their own prejudices, which gave rise to more acts of oppression that degraded blacks. </p>
<p>Myrdal believed that the great obstacle to progress was white prejudice. If white attitudes could be reformed, oppression would ease, the status of blacks would rise, white attitudes would improve further, and blacks would find yet more opportunities for success. Myrdal was convinced that if the vicious cycle could be turned into a virtuous cycle it would unlock the nation&rsquo;s true potential: &ldquo;[T]he Negro problem is not only America&rsquo;s greatest failure but also America&rsquo;s incomparably great opportunity for the future.&rdquo; If the United States could turn this failure into a triumph it would fulfill its promise as a light unto all nations. </p>
<p>Myrdal&rsquo;s supporters thought change would come quickly. Myrdal&rsquo;s assistant, Arnold Rose, added a chapter called &ldquo;Postscript Twenty Years Later&rdquo; to the 1962 edition. After a triumphant description of the progress made since the book&rsquo;s original appearance in 1944, he predicted that all legal discrimination would be abolished within ten years (it actually took only three) and that in 30 years  &mdash;  by 1992  &mdash;  residual private friction between blacks and whites would be &ldquo;on the minor order of Catholic-Protestant prejudice.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Rose was wrong, but his view was typical. When the Supreme Court outlawed school segregation in its seminal 1954 decision of Brown v. Board of Education, Thurgood Marshall, who argued the case for the black plaintiffs, believed it would take perhaps five years before full school integration was achieved nationwide. So did Kenneth Clark, the black educator whose work on the psychological effects of segregation on black children helped persuade the Supreme Court to order school desegregation. &ldquo;I confidently expected the segregation problem would be solved by 1960,&rdquo; he later wrote. </p>
<p>Integration was the key to overcoming white prejudices because as they mixed with blacks, whites would discover a common humanity that transcended race. Integration would still have to be handled properly, however. Whites would be best exposed to blacks under supervised conditions that made it clear how irrational racial prejudice really was. </p>
<p>Discussions about how blacks and whites were to be brought together came to be known as &ldquo;contact theory,&rdquo; and its most prominent spokesman was Gordon Allport. His 1953 book, The Nature of Prejudice, was frequently read in conjunction with An American Dilemma. &ldquo;Prejudice,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;&hellip; may be reduced by equal status contact between majority and minority groups in the pursuit of common goals. The effect is greatly enhanced if this contact is sanctioned by institutional supports &hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p>Schools were the perfect setting for controlled contact. White children, whose prejudices had not yet hardened, would mix with black children under conditions of equality and institutional support. Many others agreed that school integration was the essential first step. James S. Liebman of the Columbia University School of Law wrote that integrated education was the best way to reform &ldquo;the malignant hearts and minds of racist white citizens.&rdquo; In order to protect children from the &ldquo;tyranny&rdquo; of their parents he recommended that they be required to attend &ldquo;schools that are not entirely controlled by parents,&rdquo; where they could be exposed to &ldquo;a broader range of &hellip; value options than their parents could hope to provide.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Liberal intellectuals thought their judgment was better than that of ordinary Americans, and urged government to enforce enlightened views. Jennifer Hochschild of Princeton wrote that school integration was so important that it justified limiting the will of the people. Democracy would have to &ldquo;give way to liberalism,&rdquo; and Americans &ldquo;must permit elites to make their choices for them.&rdquo; She even said parents should be banned from sending children to private schools, because they would escape the benefits of integration. </p>
<p>By the 1950s, liberals therefore had a clear strategy: Integration would cure Americans of prejudice. White adults might not integrate willingly, but white children who went to school with blacks would grow up with enlightened views. The racial problem would finally be solved. </p>
<p>In the Brown decision, the Supreme Court was willing to set aside certain legal considerations to achieve this high goal. Chief Justice Earl Warren&rsquo;s ruling was light on Constitutional reasoning but cited An American Dilemma, noting the psychological damage segregation was said to do to blacks. As Paul Craig Roberts and Lawrence Stratton point out in their 1995 book, The New Color Line, the Brown ruling was not based on law but on the urgings of sociologists and the desire to do what was right. &ldquo;In the eyes of the Justices and their peers, desegregation had become the hallmark of moral society,&rdquo; they wrote. &ldquo;Legal reasoning played no role&rdquo; in the decision. Even the New York Times recognized the sentimental rather than legal nature of the ruling in its headline of May 18, 1954: &ldquo;A Sociological Decision: Court Founded Its Segregation Ruling On Hearts and Minds Rather Than Laws.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Initially, desegregation meant only that blacks could no longer be kept out of white schools  &mdash;  it did not require deliberate mixing by race  &mdash;  and Brown applied only to the legally segregated schools in the South. Most Southern school districts duly dismantled strict segregation but made no effort at integration. A small number of ambitious black parents transferred their children to white schools but whites did not transfer to black schools. </p>
<p>The era of passive desegregation ended in 1968, when the Supreme Court ruled in Green v. New Kent County that Southern schools had to do more than open their doors to a few blacks. Campuses were to be deliberately integrated through race-based student assignment, and the 1971 Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg decision sanctioned busing as the preferred means of doing so. It was not until the 1973 decision of Keyes v. Denver, however, that the court ordered race-based assignment of students in school districts outside the South that had never practiced legal segregation, and where segregated school attendance merely reflected housing patterns. Gordon Allport&rsquo;s &ldquo;contact theory&rdquo; was being implemented nationwide. </p>
<p>This was exactly what the sociologists wanted, but white parents refused to cooperate. When children from the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; part of town started arriving by the busload or  &mdash;  even worse  &mdash;  when white children were bused across town to black schools, whites cleared out. In just seven years, nine high schools in Baltimore went from all-white to all-black. In Montgomery, Alabama, Sidney Lanier High School, which used to educate the state&rsquo;s elite, had almost no white students left ten years after the first black enrolled in 1964. </p>
<p>This was the pattern everywhere. From 1968 to 1988, the Boston school district went from nearly 70 percent white to 25 percent white. Over the same period, the drop in Milwaukee was from nearly 80 percent to under 40 percent, and in San Diego from nearly 80 percent to just over 40 percent. In only eight years, from 1968 to 1976, a staggering 78 percent of the white students left the Atlanta public schools, while white enrollment in Detroit and San Francisco dropped by 61 percent. By 1992, only 15 percent of the students in the Houston public schools were white. These dry statistics reflect tremendous disruption in countless communities, as whites pulled up stakes and headed to the suburbs or as wives went to work to pay for private school. </p>
<p>In 1991, the Supreme Court began to relieve the pressure on public schools to assign students by race, and subsequent decisions left only a few permissible grounds for racial balancing. However, by then, busing had transformed America&rsquo;s big-city school districts into almost exclusively black and Hispanic preserves. For the year 2002-2003, those two groups accounted for the following percentages of the public schools of: Chicago  &mdash;  87 percent; Washington, DC  &mdash;  94 percent; St. Louis  &mdash;  82 percent; Philadelphia  &mdash;  79 percent; Cleveland  &mdash;  79 percent; Los Angeles  &mdash;  84 percent; Detroit  &mdash;  96 percent; Baltimore  &mdash;  89 percent. In New York City, whites were only 15 percent of the student population, about on par with Asians at 13 percent. In Dallas in 2005, the public schools were only 6 percent white. </p>
<p>In some areas there was a massive shift to private schools. In the Denver metropolitan area an astonishing 94 percent of white students attended private schools in 2005. A Duke University study found that in ten counties in Mississippi more than 90 percent of white students were attending private schools in 2000-2001. </p>
<p>It would be wrong to think that busing was a complete failure, however. Not all whites were willing to move or could pay for private school, and some welcomed integration. But national studies show that school integration peaked in the late 1980s and has since declined. Integration had the greatest impact on the South, where the number of blacks attending majority-white schools went from zero in 1954 to a remarkable 43 percent in 1988. By 2001, the figure had dropped to 30 percent, or the level of 1969. </p>
<p>In 1991, in the country as a whole, 66 percent of blacks attended schools where minorities were the majority. By 2004, that figure had grown to 73 percent. In Boston in 1967, the average black student attended a school that was 32 percent white; in 2003 he attended a school that was 11 percent white, and 61 percent of black students attended schools that were at least 90 percent non-white. In New York State, 60 percent of black students attended schools that were at least 90 percent black. A Scripps Howard study of US Department of Education records found that the percentage of non-white children enrolled in schools that were 90 percent non-white rose in 36 of the 50 states between 1991 and 2001. In an extensive analysis of 185 school districts with enrollments of more than 25,000, the Civil Rights Project at Harvard found that black students increased their exposure to whites in only four of those districts during the 14-year period ending in 2001. </p>
<p>In some cases, school districts came almost full circle. In 1953 in Atlanta, just before the Brown decision, there were 600 public schools serving 18,664 students. Blacks and whites were kept apart by law. Fifty years later, there were 96 much larger schools serving 55,812 students; more than three quarters were in schools where one race was the majority by at least 90 percent. </p>
<p>Gary Orfield is co-director of Harvard&rsquo;s Civil Rights Project, and has been tracking schools for more than a decade. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a major process of re-segregation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is a cowardice about this issue. People are afraid to talk about it because it is so sensitive. So we are slipping back into separate-but-equal schools . &hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p>At one time, &ldquo;magnet schools&rdquo; were supposed to solve the problem of white flight. The plan was to make urban public schools so attractive they would lure back whites who had fled to the suburbs. This policy has been an almost uniform failure, and Kansas City, Missouri, is only the most striking failure. A federal judge took over the school district in 1985, and imposed taxes to pay for the most grandiose public schools in America. Over the next 12 years, the city spent nearly $2 billion. Kansas City got 15 new schools with such things as an Olympic-sized swimming pool with an underwater viewing room, television and animation studios, a model United Nations with simultaneous interpreting equipment, a robotics lab, a planetarium, a mock court room with jury deliberation rooms, and field trips to Mexico and Senegal. A former Soviet Olympic fencing coach was recruited for a high school team. There was a $900,000 television campaign to alert whites to the remarkable new improvements. If white students were not on a bus route, the city sent taxis. </p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work. By 1997, when Kansas City finally gave up, it had the most extravagant schools in the country, but the percentage of white students was lower than ever and blacks&rsquo; scores had not budged. </p>
<p>Whites simply do not want to send their children to school with blacks. In San Francisco, a study of the school choice program by U.C. Berkeley found that the schools with the most blacks were in least demand. Chris Rosenberg, who had been with the heavily-black Starr King Elementary School for 12 years, had seen it over and over: &ldquo;When people come into some schools and they see a bunch of black kids, I can see it in their faces  &mdash;  &lsquo;Thanks, but no thanks&rsquo;.&rdquo; </p>
<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s 55,000-student district rapidly began to resegregate in 2001 after a lawsuit overturned race-based student assignments. In 2001-2002, there were 30 schools in which one race made up 60 percent or more of at least one grade. By 2005-2006 there were 50 such schools. Nor was it only whites who would not go to school with blacks. Tareyton Russ, principal of the heavily-black Willie L. Brown Jr. College Preparatory Academy explained that &ldquo;poor Chinese kids don&rsquo;t want to go to school with poor black kids [either].&rdquo; </p>
<p>Hazelwood West High School, just north of Saint Louis, Missouri, went through dramatic changes when four new middle schools opened in the area, leading to large-scale shifts of students and resources. From 2002 to 2007, black enrollment increased 32 percent while white enrollment dropped 32 percent. The blacks moving in were from middle- and upper-middle-class families but whites left anyway. Hazelwood West&rsquo;s principal Ingrid Clark-Jackson dismissed rumors that the school had a gang problem. &ldquo;It has a race problem,&rdquo; she explained. </p>
<p>An unwillingness to associate with blacks is usually considered a sign of lower-class closed-mindedness, but a recent study by Michael Emerson and David Sikkink of Rice University suggests otherwise. They found that the more education white parents had, the more likely they were to rule out schools for their children simply because of the number of blacks. Only after they had eliminated heavily-black schools did they then compare the remaining schools&rsquo; test scores and graduation rates. &ldquo;Our study arrived at a very sad and profound conclusion,&rdquo; said Dr. Emerson. &ldquo;More formal education is not the answer to racial segregation in this country.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Whites don&rsquo;t want their children in school with large numbers of Hispanics either. In most big cities, whites have not even noticed the influx of Hispanic students because they left the public schools to blacks in the 1970s and 1980s. It is a different matter when Hispanics arrive in rural areas with few blacks. &ldquo;White flight&rdquo; has come to places that had never experienced it. </p>
<p>Meatpacking plants in Nebraska towns such as Schuyler, Lexington, South Sioux City, and Madison have drawn many Hispanic workers, whose children attend public schools. In Schuyler, for example, the Hispanic influx pushed total enrollment up 19 percent from 1993 to 2003  &mdash;  while white enrollment dropped in half. Most whites did not move away, however. They took advantage of a Nebraska law that lets students attend outside their home districts, and they formed carpools to ferry their children to schools where whites were still the majority. Nebraska State Senator Ron Raikes, who called white flight &ldquo;unconscionable,&rdquo; promised to introduce a bill to stop parents from switching children out of their home districts. </p>
<p>White flight usually means better schools for the flyers, but not always. Monta Vista High School and Lynbrook High School in Cupertino, California, are known for their stellar academic records  &mdash;  but whites have almost disappeared there, too. White families who do not move away send their children to private schools, and whites with school-age children avoid Cupertino entirely. Why? The schools are almost 100 percent Asian. Whites tend to think Asians are grinds with no social life, but there is a deeper problem. As superintendent Steve Rowley explained, &ldquo;Kids who are white feel themselves a distinct minority against a majority culture.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Whites in San Francisco also began avoiding schools that became heavily Chinese. They feared the academic competition would be too intense, and that their children would be cultural minorities. </p>
<p>It would be a mistake, however, to assume that all schools are starkly segregated. Evanston Township High School, in the North Shore Chicago suburb of Evanston, is a rare example of what Brown was supposed to bring to everyone: It is 48 percent white, 39 percent black, and 9 percent Hispanic. The school of 3,100 students carefully balances the races in home rooms and gym classes, and holds special events to celebrate diversity. </p>
<p>But like so many other schools, Evanston Township High has discovered that getting students of different races in the door is not the same thing as getting them to mix. Students gravitate to different sports teams and clubs, eat lunch at segregated tables, and even leave school by different doors. Basketball players and cheerleaders are almost all black, while the swimming and water polo teams are almost all white. Whites dominate in music, theater and art. The challenging classes are so overwhelmingly white that &ldquo;you can look in a room and know if it is an honors or regular class by the color of the students&rsquo; skin,&rdquo; explained senior Nicole Summers. As sophomore Paul Schroeder summed up, &ldquo;We all go to the same school, but that is pretty much it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Many schools are therefore integrated only on paper. Kim Davis, a white senior at Palmetto High School in southern Florida explained how students socialize: &ldquo;Here it&rsquo;s very cliquish,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The whites hang out with the whites; the blacks hang out with the blacks.&rdquo; </p>
<p>During the 1990s, Montclair, New Jersey, with a population that was just over 30 percent black, was a New York City suburb favored by people who wanted racial diversity in their lives. Many of their children did not. &ldquo;Diversity for me means that I sit next to a black in homeroom,&rdquo; said a white girl at Montclair High School, which was 52 percent black. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really an aberration when I have any meaningful contact with a black kid.&rdquo; A black girl echoed her sentiments: &ldquo;Interracial dating? No way.&rdquo; </p>
<p>At Toombs County High School in Lyons, Georgia, separation was formalized in a tradition of segregated proms that began in the 1970s. In 2004, the school added a third prom  &mdash;  for Hispanics. Principal Ralph Hardy said the tradition had nothing to do with race, simply with different tastes in food and music. </p>
<p>Turner County High School in Ashburn, Georgia, got its first integrated prom in 2007, although the traditional white prom took place as well. As one recent graduate explained, &ldquo;The white people have theirs, and the black people have theirs. It&rsquo;s nothing racial at all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Taylor County High School in Butler, Georgia, broke with a 31-year tradition in 2002 and tried an integrated prom. In 2003, the 55-percent black 45-percent white school switched back to separate proms. </p>
<p>Segregated proms are not uniquely Southern. The Solomon Schechter School of Westchester, New York, announced that no non-Jewish dates would be allowed at the Junior Ball. Gann Academy in Waltham, Massachusetts, did not issue a ban on gentiles but urged students to consider the school&rsquo;s &ldquo;commitment to Jewish continuity&rdquo; when they chose dates for dances. </p>
<p>Petersburg High School in Petersburg, Virginia, was integrated in the early 1970s, but class reunions, which the alumni organize themselves, have been segregated, reflecting the reality of what it was like to be a student. As of 1997, no one objected to the divided reunions or expected them to be united in the future. </p>
<p>No combination of races appears to intgrate comfortably. Bolsa Grande High School in Garden Grove, California, is 52 percent Vietnamese and 37 percent Hispanic, and teachers try to keep an underlying current of hostility in check. Seventeen-year-old Ivan Hernandez explained that conflicts can be avoided when groups stay apart. &ldquo;People tend to stay with their own culture,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know many Vietnamese because I don&rsquo;t hang out with them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems to be a pattern that&rsquo;s happened all over the country,&rdquo; said Will Antell, a former desegregation official for the state of Minnesota. When races separate &ldquo;they&rsquo;re coming back to join their cohorts&hellip;. It&rsquo;s on being with young people like themselves.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Many schools try to encourage mixing, but students often pay no attention. A black student, LaShana Lee, wrote about how her Atlanta school celebrated Mix It Up Day, a national project that encourages students to cross racial boundaries: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mix It Up Day was just another failed attempt to get all students to &lsquo;step outside the box.&rsquo; No one was really willing to sit with different people. Everyone took it as some sort of joke, and the majority of students understood we wouldn&rsquo;t actually participate.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Researchers have found that successful integration inhibits racial mixing. If a school has only a few minority students they have no choice but to mix with the majority. &ldquo;When you get larger minority populations, they reach a size where you can have a viable single-race community,&rdquo; explained James Moody of Ohio State University, who studies school integration. &ldquo;At that point, students find enough friends within their own race and don&rsquo;t tend to make cross-racial friendships.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He noted that the best way to prevent teenagers from choosing friends of the same race is to steer them into racially mixed extra-curricular activities because people may make friendships across racial lines if they have interests in common. Another way is to segregate schools as much as possible by grade. This way, people who like to skateboard, for example, have to make friends within their own grade rather than find same-race friends in different grades. </p>
<p>The proportions of the racial mix seem to make a difference in how blacks and whites get along. Race relations are best when whites are a small minority, since whites do not try to assert themselves and must conform to black-majority standards. Black-white relations are reportedly worst when schools are 20 to 40 percent black. </p>
<p>Some schools practice a deliberate kind of segregation. Administrators often have to explain to parent groups that the white and Asian students are doing better academically than the blacks and Hispanics. Mary Perry of EdSource, a nonprofit group that researches education problems in California, explains it can be helpful to invite black and Hispanic parents to separate conferences to talk abut test scores. &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s more difficult to have a productive discussion when people&rsquo;s perspectives are so far apart,&rdquo; she explained. </p>
<p>This is the policy of principal Philip Moore of T. R. Smedberg Middle School in Sacramento, California. &ldquo;I want people to feel comfortable,&rdquo; he said, explaining that sessions are more productive when they are segregated. </p>
<p>Because there is such a demand for segregated schooling, some schools offer it on the sly. Whites fled the Dallas public schools when a judge ordered integration in 1971. The district tried to entice them back with magnet schools but that did not work, and Preston Hollow Elementary School became an overwhelmingly black and Hispanic school in the middle of a wealthy, white neighborhood. Over a period of several years, however, white students drifted back to Preston Hollow, thanks to an unwritten policy of grouping whites into &ldquo;neighborhood&rdquo; classes in a separate wing. The PTA printed up school brochures full of photographs of white children, and when white parents toured the school, teachers did not take them through the black and Hispanic wings. Increasing numbers of affluent whites started sending their children to Preston Hollow, became active in the PTA, and raised money for new library books and playground equipment. </p>
<p>As a practical matter, this could be considered a success, but it happened to be illegal. A Hispanic parent sued. When an inspector came by, Principal Teresa Parker mixed up the classes to give the impression of integration. When the truth came out, lawyers for the school argued that no one was hurt by the separation because all students got the same curriculum. A judge disagreed, and ordered Miss Parker to stop segregating the children and to pay $20,200 to the plaintiff. Miss Parker was reassigned to administrative duties. </p>
<p>Although virtually all politicians and commentators denounce school segregation, they have been known to make a virtue of it. In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that forbade Texas universities to take race into consideration when accepting students. There was a sharp drop in non-white admissions, but Texas legislators quickly found a way to raise them. They passed a law requiring state universities automatically to admit the top ten percent of the graduating classes of all Texas high schools. Since everyone knew the high schools were segregated, this restored the effect of racial preferences. The state of Florida set up a similar system, according to which the state&rsquo;s ten public universities automatically granted admission to anyone in the top 20 percent of any high school graduating class. </p>
<p>These measures encourage segregation. Ambitious blacks or Hispanics who want to go to Texas or Florida universities are better off in segregated rather than integrated or majority-white schools, because they have a better chance of making the cut for automatic admission. </p>
<p>This is the policy of principal Philip Moore of T. R. Smedberg Middle School in Sacramento, California. &ldquo;I want people to feel comfortable,&rdquo; he said, explaining that sessions are more productive when they are segregated. </p>
<p>Because there is such a demand for segregated schooling, some schools offer it on the sly. Whites fled the Dallas public schools when a judge ordered integration in 1971. The district tried to entice them back with magnet schools but that did not work, and Preston Hollow Elementary School became an overwhelmingly black and Hispanic school in the middle of a wealthy, white neighborhood. Over a period of several years, however, white students drifted back to Preston Hollow, thanks to an unwritten policy of grouping whites into &ldquo;neighborhood&rdquo; classes in a separate wing. The PTA printed up school brochures full of photographs of white children, and when white parents toured the school, teachers did not take them through the black and Hispanic wings. Increasing numbers of affluent whites started sending their children to Preston Hollow, became active in the PTA, and raised money for new library books and playground equipment. </p>

<p>After four years of separation, minorities can graduate in separate ceremonies. At the University of California at Los Angeles, it has become a bit of a trick to schedule all the ethnic graduations. There is one for blacks, one for Chicanas/Chicanos, and one for the entire Hispanic raza. UCLA used to make do with an Asian-Pacific Islander ceremony, but now it has separate graduations for Filipinos and Vietnamese, and there was talk of one for Cambodians. Outside of California, there may not be enough Filipinos or Vietnamese for a separate ceremony, but special graduations for blacks are common. </p>
<p>Some blacks assume their university will support any exclusionist fancy. At Boston&rsquo;s Northeastern University in 2005, the director of women&rsquo;s studies, Robin Chandler, advertised a four-hour &ldquo;Women of Color Dialogue&rdquo; that was to be closed to whites. After a protest from the Student Government Association, the provost ordered the session open to white women (men were still kept out). Dr. Chandler was annoyed: </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a shame that one or two white students based on white privilege, a lack of awareness of racial issues and a lack of generosity of spirit complained to the office of the provost and were able, because they were white, to gain admission to the morning session that I was forced to open up. Only one white female student showed up and I welcomed her anyway, in addition to telling the audience to conduct themselves with integrity even though the presence of a white woman was unwelcome.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A graduate of Northwestern University near Chicago summed up what may be a common experience. When asked by Newsweek about racial hostility on campus, she replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember any overt racial hostilities. You need a certain amount of contact to have hostilities.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Specific Objectives </p>
<p>School integration has clearly not proceeded as planned. It is also worth noting that when there has been integration, it has not achieved its objectives. Although the larger purpose was to solve the American dilemma, school integration had three specific goals of its own: It would lift black academic achievement, raise black self-esteem, and give black and white children better impressions of each other. There have now been hundreds of studies of the effects of integration, and none of these goals was achieved. </p>
<p>With respect to academic improvement, an exhaustive 2002 survey reported, &ldquo;there is not a single example in the published literature of a comprehensive racial balance plan that has improved black achievement or that has reduced the black-white achievement gap significantly.&rdquo; A recent book devoted entirely to the racial gap in school achievement concluded: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether African-American students attended schools that were 10 percent black or 70 percent black, the racial gap remained roughly the same . &hellip; If every school precisely mirrored the demographic profile of the nation&rsquo;s entire student population, the level of black and Hispanic achievement would not change.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Self-esteem studies have not produced what liberals expected either. Blacks, in general, have higher levels of self-esteem than whites, and integration appears to lower it. The most likely reason for this latter finding is that black children generally do not perform as well in school as white children, and they come face to face with the achievement gap only in integrated schools. </p>
<p>Findings on relations between the races also disappoint integrationists. Studies generally gauge the attitudes of white students towards blacks before and after attending integrated schools. A summary of results shows that after integration, whites are as likely to have a worse view of blacks as they are to have an improved view. These, moreover, are the findings for whites who have stayed in integrated schools, and are probably more likely than those who left to have a favorable view of blacks. </p>
<p>The advocates of school integration thought it would succeed because they believed children do not see race. They were wrong. Children separated themselves by race even in places such as Shaker Heights and Montclair, where parents wanted them to mix. Many children, however, had no choice in the matter because their parents moved to the suburbs or put them in private schools. It was both parents and children, therefore, who defeated integration. </p>
<p>Now that the Supreme Court has virtually ruled out race-based student assignment, the country is reverting to neighborhood schools that are not legally segregated but that reflect self-segregated housing patterns. This has reduced integrationists to a position almost identical to that of Gunnar Myrdal in 1948. As Brian Stults of the University of Florida at Gainesville explained: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sort of a chicken-and-egg problem: We need integration in schools to lessen prejudice, which will then reduce residential segregation, but in order to have school integration, we need residential integration.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Mrs. Brace, while seeming to have good intentions, is simply another idiot American whos actions increase the chaos in this nation. You see, these foreign interlopers have never suffieciently been given the message that they are here illegally, they are not welcome, and they never will be welcome. Instead, she has tried to empower &#8220;illegality&#8221;,and lawlessness by her actions. I haven&rsquo;t the slightest doubt that though Mrs. Brace, failed for now, as she herself admits, the first time she perceives that illegal aliens Hispanics will welcome here in her own nation, she will jump at the chance. Some people don&rsquo;t get it, and they never will get it.</p>

<p>He was hired by the hard leftists of the Roosevelt administration and he knew absolutely nothing about blacks.  Most of his book is just NAACP communist party of the USA propaganda warmed over.</p>
<p>He should have been housed in the Anacostia section of DC, a black neighborhood so dangerous that even during WW2 Marines from a military base located in the neighborhood were ordered to never, never leave the base unless accompanied by another Marine.</p>
<p>He should have looked around DC.  It&rsquo;s an absolute national disgrace for a first world great world power to have such a one of the worst crime rates, illegitimate births, wretched school systems and disfunctional black run local government.</p>
<p>But no, Myrdal, a member of the Swedish communist party, just parrotted the US communist party for his book.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Her son made no friends either. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been invited to a birthday party,&rdquo; she explained.&#8221;</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just as well.  Hispanic children&rsquo;s birthday parties are not just for a few children.  They are for all ages and often feature a lot of drinking.</p>
<p>The S. California papers are full of accounts of murders committed at christening parties, 50th anniversary parties, baby showers, children&rsquo;s birthday parties and other family events by drunken belligerent hispanics.</p>
<p>It appears to be part of the macho culture to invade these events with guns blasting.</p>

			<p>Now well into my seventh decade, I&rsquo;ve lived through the great &#8220;awakening&#8221; of the Fifties and Sixties that posited that all we had to do to achieve integration was to force the races to go to school together and everybody would quickly realize that we&rsquo;re exactly equal under the skin, possessed of the same hopes and desires, and equally sharing in the full range of human potential.</p>
<p>I suppose the last fifty years have finally proved the folly of all the foregoing assumptions to everybody&rsquo;s satisfaction, though now to openly state what everybody knows for a fact is the most heinous of offenses.  The means used to enforce the dogma will become increasingly draconian.</p>

<p>Children may or may not see race, but they certainly see behavior.  Being hunted and beaten by a pack of 4 or 5 blacks tends to teach white children some truths about black behavior that the white hating liberals who have made an excellent living off the trillion dollars that has been spent on school integregation in the last 70 years refuse to recognize.</p>
<p>And immigrant children are appalled when they start school and are exposed to the behavior of blacks.</p>
<p>About half my nursing school class was Philipinos who had attended school with blacks.  Their opinions about blacks would never pass the monitors at amren and would probably be reported as hate crime by the adl and splc monitors who read this site.</p>

			<p>This is one more example of the &#8220;fatal conceit&#8221; of the marxist,  that the world may be controlled by top down commands.  Human relationships, whether economic or social, form from the bottom up, by the decisions of each individual.  They are tempered by reality.  Race, ethnicity, tribe, are all real. The ethereal force of &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; is not.  Human fungibility is not.  Integration was a failure only from the point of view of the marxist.  Individuals of any tribe are happy when their right of freedom of association is not infringed.</p>

			<p>   &#8220;People like people whom are like themselves&#8221;. It is basic human nature. Nothing racist about it. It has proven itself over and over since the beginning of time. For whatever reason the races are different. And in the beginning, they were separated. And nature was in balance. We will never live in peace as an integrated society. The best thing that could happen for ALL races, would be to separate again. The only race whites seem to have anything in common with, are Asians. Blacks don&rsquo;t work well with any other race, nor do middle eastern people. Separate and live in peace, and prosper. </p>

			<p>I attended a high school that was 75% black and as with the Dallas Schools, my high school pretty much moved most of the white kids into the college-prep/honors track (provided there were enough neurons firing off at any given moment). 15 years before, this was one of the top high schools in the nation, but socialism has a tendency to kill excellence. The bulk of our minority students came from section-8 housing and anyone with a few bucks to spare began sending junior to a private school. There were a group of about 6 - 8 blacks who were in this track for my graduating class and they were generally well behaved and have probably made something of themselves. Although, one guy who attended school with me pulled a stunt similar to John Travolta&rsquo;s character in Pulp Fiction. The number of minority children at my kids elementary school can be counted on both hands.</p>

			<p>Laura Cho fails to realize that without White taxpayers, there wouldn&rsquo;t be Korean students in the schools.  Besides, because of the largess of Whites, she doesn&rsquo;t have to live with Kim Jung Ill.<br>
Whites that I have gone to school with had the indubitable intelligence that eclipsed that of Koreans.  All Korean Americans did was memorize and replicate math.  As for creative genius, they didn&rsquo;t have what intellectual Whites had, be they Jew or Gentile.  Koreans study the greatness of Western intellectual genius.  I cannot even name one famous Korean or Asian that contributed to the arts or inventions&hellip;..  Maybe there are a few, but I haven&rsquo;t heard of them.</p>

<p>And yet, the &#8220;high achieving Asian children&#8221;, no doubt, are being instructed from textbooks written by Whites. For instance, the computer and software revolution started in the U.S. and taught to the rest of the world,was,for instance,an almost exclusively white baby boomer creation  &mdash;  ninety percent of the texts and articles on these subjects were written by them. Asians,and all others, were Johnny come latelys.</p>

<p>This may be, or may not be, true. </p>
<p>As Cho states, though, were the situation reversed and a tyrannical Government was trying to force Koreans to be &#8220;equal&#8221; to the &#8220;Blacks&#8221;, when no evidence exists showing the two races are equal in either intelligence or socially beneficial &#8220;industriousness&#8221;, she would find it to be more than &#8220;interesting&#8221;. In fact, she would know just how Whites feel.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Whites tend to admire those of other races who achieve based on ability. Koreans, no less than Whites, would rightly resent a Government that forces them and their children down to the level of their inferiors.</p>

			<p>Hey, Laura Cho,<br>
You say you are a Korean-American.  So I guess the obvious conclusion would be that you or your parents came here from Korea, which, obviously, is populated and run by Koreans.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that, while you are crowing about how white children cannot compete with your smart Asian kids, you have proven by your actions of coming here that a majority white country is preferable to one run by Koreans.</p>
<p>How come you aren&rsquo;t in Korea with your superior Korean children in what surely must be superior Korean schools?</p>

<p>WHAT does a Swede in the 1940&rsquo;s know about blacks, race or both in America or anywhere?? Sweden at the time was 100% white so Mr. Myrdal had no experience of living near large numbers of blacks or understanding. I wonder if he were alive, what he would think today of all of the Muslim immigration reeking havoc in Sweden today or what would he think of the African immigrants in Sweden who, lo and behold, are causing high crime and draining the welfare system there??? I&rsquo;ll be he wouldn&rsquo;t be so naive.</p>

<p>If Asians were more intelligent and industrious than whites, than they wouldn&rsquo;t have had  to come to a &#8220;white&#8221; country now would they, Laura? I hate to break it to you Laura, but most of the world&rsquo;s inventions such as in the medical field or science, come from whites. Asians, however are good at copying or adding to white invented things. The reason whites flee your schools is because whites would rather be with their own instead, just like asians, blacks and hispanics. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>

			<p>The companies ITT and CSA working in Kuwait and providing employee housing here in Kuwait City see to it that one black and one white is housed in the 2 bedroom apartments. Blacks ttend to keep the A/C turned down or off, whites leave it on and cool. Blacks are inclined to make alcohol and try being pimps with Philippino runaway maids, whites do not. Blacks stay up all night and sleep in the military vehicles we are working on at Camp Arifjan. Blacks sign in and then leave and are never reprimanded for it. Whites are forced to listen to gangsta rap all day because management fears to say anything to the blacks. So in closing I would say that integration at the overseas work place is a failure also, despite the social engineering efforts to force it on us.</p>

			<p>Laura Cho, from the estimates I&rsquo;ve seen Asians are smarter than whites, but only by 3-6 IQ points.  Most of the difference is accounted for by what you call industriousness, but most white parents would call slave-driving children, which we don&rsquo;t want to do.  If the presence of your people means that we have to treat our children the way you do to compete, we&rsquo;d be better off without you.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with having races segregated at a particular school.  The children don&rsquo;t have any contact with each other, eat in the cafeteria at different times and have different class schedules so they don&rsquo;t run into each other in the hallways.  Forcing them together will force White parents to withdraw their students.  The school&rsquo;s academic performance drops, local tax funding dries up because of White flight and violence soars because of friction caused by integrating the colored students together.  Is it more important to maintain an illusion or educating children in the best possible environment?</p>

The true measure of intelligence is innovation. Having the ability to diagnose a problem, then formulate and implement a solution is true intelligence. This is something in which whites excel way beyond the vaunted &#8220;Asian genius&#8221;. </p>

<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s true that some whites won&rsquo;t be able to keep up, but generally, it is more of a cultural difference than a difference in ability.  Asians&rsquo; IQs, on average, are only slightly higher than than of whites.</p>
<p>The real reason whites leave schools like that is because (1) the parents want their kids to be balanced and well-rounded, and (2) because generally Asian kids group together in cliques and play stupid social games well through college.  Don&rsquo;t try to deny the latter issue, since I lived in Japan as a child and have been part of both white and Asian social circles.  </p>
<p>The &#8216;cliqueyness&rsquo; of Koreans and Japanese is a very well-known phenomenon.</p>
<p>Another potential issue is the reticence of Asians to speak out and discuss interesting subjects without prompting by a teacher.  High-IQ whites, therefore, tend to get extremely bored in an Asian environment, since most students simply parrot the teacher&rsquo;s lectures and cram for tests   &mdash;   they do not have the urge to learn, the love for tinkering, the creative and innovative and eccentric minds of the most intelligent whites.  </p>
<p>As you know, cheating is also rampant in the Asian community.  In both Korean and Japanese, it is called &#8216;cunning&rsquo;, a word borrowed from English to now simply mean cheating.  Most Korean and Japanese students think nothing of copying their peers&rsquo; homework.  They care far more about grades than about honesty or integrity.  </p>
<p>This gets back to the cliquey social thing as well   &mdash;   kids often find out that relationships with Asian students are often simply a fad.  Once the girl or guy finds another who is cooler, or feels that their friends or parents don&rsquo;t approve, they will coolly drop their previous partner without remorse.</p>
<p>Sure, there are those who don&rsquo;t fit these generalizations, and I have a great many friends from many different Asian countries, but these cultural differences are real and are often a problem for whites.</p>
<p>Remember that all of the science, math, technology, and other aspects of civilization being studiously memorized by your peers was developed by white people.  Not too shabby, eh?  Why wasn&rsquo;t it developed by those studious kids&rsquo; ancestors instead?</p>

			<p>Ms. Cho, it is truly heart-warming to hear of children being studious.   There seems to be something awry in your calculus, though.</p>
<p>At 90%, the Asians in the schools you refer to are no minority (I&rsquo;m sure some of those bright kids can confirm this for you), so to say that &#8220;Asian minorities are the smart ones&#8221; is not relevant.</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise that White American children might not keep up very easily in a foreign school.  Likewise, perhaps those Asian kids excel in that overwhelmingly Asian environment precisely because it is an Asian environment? </p>
<p>The statement that Whites &#8220;are forced to flee&#8221;, however, is greatly disturbing.  </p>
<p>Is that part of the program that your brilliant kids are so industriously pursuing, or is it a natural, inevitable outcome of such an overwhelming Asian presence that Whites cannot live there comfortably? </p>
<p>White people built a country here that you or your forebears found worth leaving Asia for.  If you believe it is acceptable to force the whites &#8220;to flee&#8221;,  you had better pack your bags. </p>

<p>This election year of the great mulatoe has blinded everyone.<br>
More and more TV commercials featuring black guy white girl<br>
are on your set.  No one even thinks to boycott these companies.<br>
It&rsquo;s the women mostly white that are really flocking to this<br>
hype.  I see more and more interracial couples.  Mostly white<br>
girl and black guy.  It has become so chic to have a mulato in<br>
the family.  BHO is very popular for all the wrong reasons.<br>
Here come the mixed race kids with no dad to be found.  Oh yeah<br>
I forgot the guys in jail &#8216;cause whitey let &#8216;im down.</p>

			<p>I am a Korean America living in Cupertino, California and our schools are 90 percent Asian and 10 percent Caucasian. Whites cannot keep up with our high achieving Asian children and are forced to flee since they lack the industriousness and intelligence that their Asian counterparts take for granted. </p>
<p> How exactly are &#8220;they forced to flee&#8221;  I&rsquo;m not clear on this. Might they be leaving because they feel uncomfortable being the minority? As far as I can see, whites are now the minority in California.</p>

			<p>The first story describes the main reason I feel I couldn&rsquo;t have a child at this point in my life. If I had a child I probably couldn&rsquo;t afford to send him to an expensive private school, and I sure as hell wouldn&rsquo;t torture a kid by sending him to a 90 percent black/latino public school. Even the catholic schools seem all Latino these days.  </p>
<p>I am guessing there a lot of other people like me out there that would probably have kids or have more kids but chose not too for this reason.</p>

You sound unperceptive and lacking in self-esteem.  You do realize that the number of Asian immigrants who are college educated is higher than the national average, right?  The children do better partially because of higher than average educated parentage.</p>
<p>And about the self esteem: I&rsquo;ve noticed people who love to embrace a triumphant view of their race tend to be small people who have nothing going on in their lives so they look for meaning by taking a supremacist view.  These kinds of people range from you to La Raza activists to Stormfront regulars.     </p>

			<p>I would like to inform Laura Cho that I have worked with Asians for over 20 years and see first hand how they use their racial minority status to steal jobs but do not contribute their fair share to our work efforts.  Many are hired as engineers but due to language difficulties and their tenative culture, they are not social and do not help us solve problems.  But they do take our money and will be vocal when they are passed over for promotion.  I just don&rsquo;t get it.  Asians have very supremacist views but they are only supreme when whites are oppressed by blacks or by our Bolshevik leaders.</p>

<p>Whites, especially younger families, are leaving California because it&rsquo;s expensive, crowded, and has high taxes. Let&rsquo;s look at Cupertino, in reality, a boring (albeit safe) suburb filled with tract homes built predominantly in the 1950s through 1970s. If you were to plop this city outside of Dallas the average house would sell for around $140,000 but in glorious Cupertino the median house price is over 1 million dollars. Out of 76 houses listed (and mind you Silicon Valley prices are declining also..) the cheapest is:</p>
<p>&#8220;$649,000 <br>
Beds:  2  Type:  SFR  Sq. Ft.:  800  Lot Size:  3,300 Sq. Ft.   <br>
Baths:  1/0  Built:  1947  <br>
Great opportunity to do some remodeling or tear down and build your dream home on this 2 br 1 ba property located in a nice neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.. a 2 bedroom 1 bath 800 square foot home built in 1947 on a small lot that sounds as if it needs to be remodeled or torn down.. and all for only $649,000! Such a deal. Mind you this is the cheapest house out of 76 currently listed for sale. The median price for a single family home in Cupertino is around 1.25 million. </p>
<p>Ms. Cho, many Whites who grew up in California think these prices are a joke&hellip; but are willing to sell them so that they can bank their profits and move to a much cheaper, less crowded area with lower taxes. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;The advocates of school integration thought it would succeed because they believed children do not see race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, children at a very young age recognize race very clearly, and without having been taught anything about it.  Race, much more than most other physical attributes, is very evident to very young children.</p>
<p>The basic assumption upon which rested the entire structure of such movements as the civil rights movement and of the movement for racial integration pushed by the corrupt court of Brown was the false assumption of radical egalitarianism, viz. that we were all exactly the same in every significant way regardless of race.  Many of us or our parents generation and their ancestors knew this to be false without having a rigorous scientific explanation at hand.  This knowledge was lost during the late 60&rsquo;s and following because of the inroads of the egalitarian left in its Gramschian &#8220;march though the institutions&#8221; but it remains as true today as it has always been.  There are major and very significant racial differences in cognitive ability, time preferences, self-control, and may other areas and this has now been established beyond any reasonable doubt in the most scientific manner possible (see Jensen, Murray and Hernstein, et al).  Not only has the radical egalitarian theory upon which the entire racial spoils system is base been proven wrong, it has been convincingly demonstrated that the basis for fundamental racial differences is primarily genetic and therefore cannot be changed by any &#8220;government program&#8221; or intervention.</p>
<p>Integration will never succeed because it involves the mixing of very different types of individuals with very different mores and values as well as abilities and behaviors.  The attempt to force integration, rather than having the desired effect, uniformly has the opposite effect, i.e. it leads whites to a new awareness of the reality of racial differences.  If you wish to transform a liberal with a pro-black agenda into a conservative, race realist, the best way to do so is to expose him to the reality of black life in the inner cities(force him to live among inner city blacks for one year and then ask him about his world view).  The reason that this is effective is because of the reality of racial differences in very significant areas.</p>
<p>Unlike any other &#8220;immigrant class&#8221;, blacks originally entered the US, not as immigrants but as slaves.  They were clearly the most primitive people to ever populate the country (more primitive than the American indian tribes) and despite their being given citizenship after the War of Northern Aggression, they have never been assimilated into the mainstream of American culture and life.  Due to their genetic heritage, they never will be and any and all attempts to force them to do so, whether it be through forced integration of schools or the racial spoils system or whatever, are doomed to failure.  The history of the so-called civil rights movement is the history of one failure after another and though blacks now enjoy a preferred status in American society, it is only the few talented, intelligent blacks who really benefit from it with most blacks remaining in the underclass.  In spite of literally trillions of dollars having been spent to &#8220;give blacks a helping hand&#8221;, there has been no significant improvement in the status of the average black today and certainly no sense of gratitude toward a white majority which spent all that money for the express purpose of benefiting blacks.  You can send someone to the finest schools, support them in a royal manner, etc. but if they have an IQ of 80, they will never become a first class mathematician, no matter how much you spend.  Genes do not respect ideology.</p>

			<p>We will never really know how many Americans buy into the integration mania as opposed to how many merely give it lip service. The reason is simple: to voice the obvious, that you are more comfortable with your own kind than with other kinds risks being classified a bigot, which insures that you will be a social outcast. So most either mouth the accepted idiocy or keep mum.</p>
<p>The fact is that integration has always been a top down project imposed on those who have to live its horrors by the professional class that has the income to avoid the consequences of its own prescriptions.</p>
<p>It is so obvious to a White that Blacks, Hispanics and Asians hate him - of course, Black hatred is more brutally obvious than Asian hatred, but they are both manifest - that the amazing thing is how the myth of racial amity and integration can be maintained at all! And yet it is. The Emperor Has No Clothes. And yet the emporer can walk around naked for a long time, maybe forever, as long as the emperor&rsquo;s terror regime holds.</p>

Well, I don&rsquo;t know that the underachievers are necessarily to be equated with &#8220;less smart&#8221;.   But there is certainly truth to be gleaned from this, and it should not be dismissed.    I take no offense at her comments; they are worth heeding. </p>
<p>Generally speaking,  I do believe that Americans, basking in the security, prosperity, and comfort of &#8220;the American century&#8221; have grown soft and self-indulgent. American kids today take too much for granted. They (we) do not work so hard as our ;ancestors did.  During the past half century, everything in education has been dumbed down and softened up. (Much of this has been done to accommodate certain minorities. I don&rsquo;t mean Asians)  </p>
<p>And (another thought) if they&rsquo;re only 10%, then whites are very much the minority there. Could it be that, as WD points out, they might be doing less well than Asian students in what has become essentially an Asian environment?</p>
<p>Asians, as the newcomers to the scene, undeniably do apply themselves diligently and work very hard  in a way that white students today don&rsquo;t. They deserve credit for that.  But it&rsquo;s still to be seen if in a couple of generations the Asians will taper off and become lazy too.</p>

I agree with your excellent post, of course.  But never say never!  There&rsquo;s a catch. As far as blacks utterly failing to assimilate into the mainstream,  one thing you failed to consider (and it&rsquo;s a  <i>major </i> thing)  is something called &#8220;miscegenation&#8221;.  The radical Left surely know, if only  deep in their own hearts, that what you say above is true, and that their policies of integration, when taken alone, have not been working. They can see the failure as well as we can.  That is why they are pushing ultimately, for <i>miscegenation. </i>Through miscegenation of the races, blacks WILL be assimilated into the mainstream&hellip;because there will no longer be any white mainstream.   And that is why we see all those commercials of chummy interracial buddies -  and those jolly news teams -  and those  happy weather reporters -  with smiling black man and white woman placed before us to get our eyes accustomed to seeing it&hellip; especially the eyes of children who will grow up not giving it a second thought.</p>
<p>Furthermore, certain  ethnic sub-groups groups have learned that integration is good FOR THEM, because it gives them access to the all the wealth, positions, and  benefits of the larger society around them.  For those groups for whom integration has proven spectacularly successful, it allows them to wield power and wealth far beyond what they could hold as just members of their own small community.  Thus, to them, integration as a concept is not only highly desirable, it is absolutely essential. It must be portrayed as moral and righteous. It must be made mandatory; and all who oppose it must be vilified as immoral, criminal, even insane.  For this reason, such groups will never allow integration to be questioned or to fail   &mdash;   not on account of the blacks, but for their own sake.  Therefore, if  mere integration of black and white hasn&rsquo;t been seen to work, then it will have to be MADE TO WORK through complete miscegenation of  the races, so that there is no longer any clear distinction between black or white. And clearly, that is where we are heading.</p>

			<p>Integration certainly did not enrich my metro Atlanta elementary school when blacks were enrolled there in &#8216;69. The school was not a good one anyway (so I certainly do not claim that majority white schools are all great), but the defensive, even violent black girls made it even worse. They thought they had the right to pick on white girls and get away with it, and indeed they did get away with it, as the wimpy white male principal did not do his job.</p>
<p>Ironically, the black boys and the white boys got along well. The black boys may have been disruptive and obnoxious (although no more so than the white boys), but at least they did not have racial attitudes. Incidentally, some of the blacks were nice enough.</p>

			<p>Laura - </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right about Asians being higher achievers than whites. I hope that you haven&rsquo;t gotten the impression that AmRen readers are trying to class Asians with blacks and Hispanics as low-achieving minorities. Quite the opposite, I think most AmRen readers like and respect East Asian people, as they generally possess the same qualities that whites have, and that we find so lacking among other minority groups: intelligence, cultural acheivements, sexual restraint, and a sense of perspective about the world.</p>
<p>However, I think that your comments were rather arrogant - given that you hail from immigrant stock, claiming that whites are &#8216;forced to flee&rsquo; Asian communities because of competition is taking a bit of a liberty!</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think some people on this page have rather over-reacted to Laura&rsquo;s comment. Asians have highly developed and ancient cultures, from which whites have learned a good deal. What&rsquo;s more, the acheivement gap between whites and Asians looks set to widen, as the lower echelons of white society are reproducing at a much higher rate than average, thanks to welfare. I hope that Laura&rsquo;s rather small-minded comment won&rsquo;t distract whites from working together with Asians in the fight against the demographic encroachment of the Third World. Both our communities have a good deal to fear from the growing waves of Black, Muslim and Hispanic immigration into the developed world!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading these comments Laura, please post a reply as it would be interesting having a dialogue with a critic of ours who comes from an Asian background! (They usually tend to be white liberals)</p>
<p>Oh and Julio, you need to get your facts right: Hispanics score an average of between 11 - 13 IQ points BELOW whites. Which is why I&rsquo;m afraid Latin America is relatively poor compared to the US and Canada.</p>

			<p>Actually Julio, Hispanics have some of the lowest scores in the nation when it comes to their performance on college admittance tests and asians just work hard (they aren&rsquo;t genetically smarter than whites overall). </p>
<p>Where I live, the school district is 73% Hispanic with almost a 50% drop out rate feeding LA gangs and is one of the most criminal dismal situations on the planet, yet almost 20 billion dollars a year was poured into it this year ($19,986,000,000 US dollars / 694,288 students = $28,786.32 per child [Julio I needed to convert billions to scientific notation on my calculator to finish the equation.. can you do that?]) for a very respectable dollar per child ratio with small class sizes and plenty of teachers. </p>
<p>Consider that Des Moines Public School District is 82% white ($397,700,000 US dollars / 31,221 students = $12,738.22 per child) and makes due with less than half the amount of money spent per child yet has a drop out rate of only 16% and a large majority off that appears to be from the non-white minorities. Overall Des Moines performance on comparable standardized tests might as well make them from another planet compared to Los Angeles. </p>
<p>These results are mirrored all over the country. You can go to schoolmatters.com and see for yourself. Where you have large groups of white people: you have better and greater academic and social desirable results. Where you have large groups of latinos or blacks: you have less than desirable academic and social results. </p>
<p>No amount of liberal hyperbole changes the observable reality. As for Charles Murray, I believe he&rsquo;s a Harvard man. Let me see a proper citation for your assertion that Hispanics have the highest IQ (along with Asians) so I can properly qualify it as untrue. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

			<p>If Korean kids are out-performing European-American kids in American schools, then I congratulate the Koreans.  Also, crime statistics tell us that Korean-Americans commit fewer crimes than most other ethnic groups.  To that I say, congratulations and thanks.  </p>
<p>Now, in spite of these (and other benefits) of having Koreans in the USA, I still prefer that huge sections of America not become &#8220;90% Asian.&#8221;  Laura Cho is probably a nice person and good citizen.  However, I suspect that even Laura would protest Korea becoming 90% Japanese, African, Mexican, or European.  Korea is an interesting country, rich in history and culture.  The Koreans should be free to keep their homeland &#8220;Korean&#8221; in the same way that  Americans should be able to keep America &#8220;American.&#8221;</p>

			<p>John&rsquo;s post is specious in that he lumps all Whites together from even different generations.  If Whites went to Japan and China in the numbers that Asians have come West, we might see Whites moving Asians out and showing intellectual preeminence there as well.  The only reason we don&rsquo;t see that is the Asian cultures have not produced civilizations that tantalize the Whites as we tantalize Asians, no matter how many potemkin villages China may produce to unwary olympic viewers watching the drab, uniform customs of their procrustean habits forced on all.  Every group in the world wants what the blessed Whites have produced, not the obverse&hellip;. </p>

<p><i>Well, it would appear that Laura Cho has hit a nerve.</i></p>
<p>Hmmm..  I would call my response fact checking not &#8220;hitting a nerve&#8221;. If you look at my previous post, you&rsquo;ll see that Ms. Cho lied about the number of White students attending Cupertino schools, that kills the foundation of most of her arguement. Also she presented absolutely no evidence that Whites are leaving Cupertino schools because of Asian students. If she did I would be willing to discuss it.. but unless she does, I consider her to be a troll. </p>
<p><i>I ask why, if we&rsquo;re so smart, we&rsquo;re letting black Africans and Hispanics steal our country. </i> <i>I haven&rsquo;t noticed that the Japanese or Koreans are letting in hordes of unproductive illegal aliens or promoting the least productive and most criminal classes in their countries to privileged status.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about intelligence, it&rsquo;s about altruism run amock. Smart people foolish choices. That said, I agree with you, that the more ethnocentric Asians are making the wiser choices over immigration and crime.  White countries are not only being over run by non-Whites but for the past 4 decades in Europe and more recently the US, Whites have not even replacing their numbers through reproduction. Further, the smartest Whites (the top 10% in IQ), now tend to have on average the fewest children. Basially we are seeing a slow collective racial and cultural suicide. </p>

Lunancy, not stupidity, is the correct word. </p>

			<p><i>White flight usually means better schools for the flyers, but not always. Monta Vista High School and Lynbrook High School in Cupertino, California, are known for their stellar academic records  &mdash;  but whites have almost disappeared there, too. </i></p>
<p>Mr. Taylor, I am assuming you read the Wall Street Journal article that claims that the &#8220;White flight&#8221; of Cupertino schools is due to academic pressue. Unfortunately this was another article in the MSM that distorts racial issues. </p>
<p>Lynnbrook High School is actually in West San Jose not Cupertino (although some of it&rsquo;s students do come from Cupertino..) and is 24% White. Monte Vista, which is in Cupertino, is 28% White. The two other high schools in Cupertino  Homestead High and Cupertino High are 50.4% and 37.5% White respectively. These number closely reflect the number of White teenagers from their respective neighborhoods.</p>
<p><br>
<i> Whites in San Francisco also began avoiding schools that became heavily Chinese. They feared the academic competition would be too intense, and that their children would be cultural minorities.</i></p>
<p>Hmmm.. when integration came to San Francisc Schools in the 70s, White kids were a targeted mostly by feral Black kids. (the percentage of Black students in SF schools was much higher then..) This is another one of those things that the mainstream does not want to discuss out in the open. I know of several White people who pulled out of SF schools in the 70s and 80s but in no cases did I even hear it was because of the &#8220;overly competitve&#8221; Chinese students. The several White parents who send their kids to SF schools are relieved when they find out their kids are going to a majority Asian school. (There are basically no majority White schools in San Francisco since Whites make up less than 10% of the SF school population..) The reality is that San Francisco sends students radomly to schools not based upon their neighborhoods but on the needs for &#8220;diversity&#8221;. A friend of mine opted to move out of San Francisco when he found out the only school his six year old daughter could attend was in one of the worst neighborhoods in town. White parents in San Francisco do not fear sending their children to schools with a majority or Asians, they fear their kids will be targets at schools with a high percentage of Latinos and Blacks. <br>

<p>Nobody is denying on here that Asians are achievers, especially the Japanese and Koreans. They have clean modern societies. However, I don&rsquo;t think white kids are for one second, fleeing because of intellectual differences but because of cultural difference. Asians tend to be geared for a different learning environment, one that doesn&rsquo;t suit whites. Different cultures and races are different As someone else pointed out, Koreans in Korea would not like or allow a situation where 90% of a school class there was white and if it were, the Korean students would leave to a Korean class. Asians guard their race and culture because they want to keep their culture Asian and we whites just want the same.</p>

<p>The real reason is that the Chinese and Japanese DON&rsquo;T LET JUST ANYONE INTO THEIR COUNTRIES as we in the U.S. and U.K. do. I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but I bet their laws against illegal entry are pretty harsh too. Anybody know?</p>

<p>I know for a fact that China does not allow one to immigrate and gain citizenship period. Japan does only if one&rsquo;s parents are of Japanese ancestry. China and Japan do allow  small amounts of foreign nationals to work and reside there only if they are filling a job shortage, have a needed skill that is not possible to find or is difficult to find, or work for a branch of a foreign company (ie. an American working for a US company based in Japan.)  Legal expats usually come on job contracts that last a certain period of time and than they must return home. Most expats are from developed ie.white countries. They do allow a small amount of  students in student exchange programs.  The key here is small, the numbers of foreigners are very small. All legal entrants must undergo criminal background and disease checks.   Illegal entry is strictly enforced and illegal migrants are deported quickly.</p>

thank you for the kind words; you are of course right in stating that ultimately the left may indeed win in the only way possible, viz. by producing a mongrel race of the lowest common denominator.  The only real way in which to create a society of equals is to dumb down those who are of higher than average intelligence and the only way to accomplish that is to reduce the mean IQ of that group through racial mixing, preferably by forcing the smartest whites to mate with the least intelligent blacks.  This process is already in progress as you indicate.  We have already seen its beneficial effects on mean black IQ, which is 85 in the US but 70 in sub-saharan Africa and very close to that in the regions of Western Africa from which most of the ancestors of todays blacks came from.  In time with a dramatic increase in mixed race progeny, the mean white IQ will inevitably approach that of blacks, meeting somewhere between the current black and white means, around 92 or so.<br>
Such is the future prospect for a truly racially integrated America and it is a place that few whites at least would ever wish to inhabit.<br>
But you are certainly right in saying that it is in fact the only way in which to achieve &#8220;true&#8221; equality.</p>

			<p>It may be that one day in the far off distant future, when this country no longer exists, a group of future anthropologists will try to find out the reason why the descendants of a group of highly educated intelligent white men, with high ideals to fight against tyranny, founded the basis for a free government, and started and built the greatest nation on earth, and then for some inexplicable reason, their descendants gave away those rights and freedoms, fought hard for by their ancestors and kinsmen, and gave away their resources, their culture, their people, their government, their entire nation, to untold masses of alien races they let into their country, who had no interest in the host race other than to get what they could from them and take over their population by their sheer numbers, and in the process they became extinct in thir own country, much like the ancient Mayan civilization. <br>
Their conclusion might be something like this, an insane political disease of the mind slowly infected one group, and spread like a cancer, that got out of hand. Other whites tried to stop it before it was too late, but before this could happen, it was too far gone and everything was lost. Who knows, maybe if there are any whites remaing in this time, they will be smart enough to learn from our grave mistakes and start over. </p>
