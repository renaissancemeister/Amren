	<p>White people who are victims of discrimination are also more likely to be overweight, a study has found.</p>
<p>Researchers say they may become overweight as a direct result of the sense of being ill-treated by others.</p>
<p>The study of more than 3,000 adults showed that there was no similar correlation between feeling persecuted and being overweight among black people.</p>
<p>Participants in the American study &mdash; all from around Chicago &mdash; were weighed and interviewed about their health habits and social status.</p>
<p>They were also asked about perceived discrimination &mdash; including how often they believed they had been treated disrespectfully, received poorer service than other people or felt threatened or harassed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Compared with Irish, Jewish, Polish and Italian Whites who did not experience perceived chronic discrimination, Irish, Jewish, Polish and Italian Whites who perceived chronic discrimination were 2 to 6 times more likely to have a high-risk waist circumference,&rsquo; the researchers, from Purdue University, Indiana, told, the American Journal of Public Health.</p>
<p>White ethnic-minority groups may experience worse discrimination than other whites, and this experience &lsquo;may adversely affect their health&rsquo;, the study adds.</p>
<p>In contrast, there was no clear evidence that obesity in black and Hispanic adults was related to discrimination.</p>
<p>The researchers speculate that this may be because of expectations; black and Hispanic people in the U.S. are more likely than whites to be accustomed to discrimination and may find it easier to dismiss.<br>

<p>I may not have the same lofty academic credentials as these &#8220;researchers,&#8221; or the same impressive deductive skills, but did it ever occur to them that it might be obesity that leads to discrimination, rather than the other way around?  Seems a lot more likely to me, but what do I know&hellip;</p>

			<p>The whole population of this study was from Chicagoland, a tri-state area known for its wide-load populace? That alone should discredit this study.<br>
Any first grader could tell you that children are not teased into becoming fat - those children are teased *because* they are fat. <br>
If Britain is worried about NHS paying for diabetes supplies, dialysis and gastric banding because of a fat, oppressed native population, the simple solution is to remove the non-native oppressors.</p>

			<p>Finally, a reason why so many Whites have become obese.  Fight it, get up and run off the stress and pounds!  You&rsquo;ll be better equiped to survive if violence arrives too.</p>

			<p>Since the middle of April, I&rsquo;ve been walking four and a half miles a day at a pretty good clip.  I&rsquo;ve lost about fifteen pounds and my doctor laughed recently when she tapped my fifty-five year old legs.  &#8220;Your heart sounds great,&#8221; she said.  Be sure to include some hills in your path.  You&rsquo;ll never really get your legs under you if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You know, the Dems are out to tax the rich man, but in order to enjoy an abundant life, he needs exactly that to which you already have access  &mdash;  a good pair of walking shoes, a plate of fresh vegetables and a library card.  The rich can eat only one apple at a time.  What the affluent have that most poor do not is the knack of doing without, of repressing desire.  Here in the American South, white and black have traditionally learned  to survive without material wealth.  If Obama is elected and raises taxes on overburdened businesses, the whole country may get the opportunity of learning to do without.</p>

			<p>The key flaw in the methodology of this study is the word &#8220;perceived&#8221;. Just because someone &#8220;perceives&#8221; they are &#8220;being treated disrespectfully&#8221; / &#8220;harrassed&#8221; etc, DOESN&rsquo;T MEAN that they are. Discrimination can mean almost anything to almost anyone. </p>

			<p>Black people are the most overweight group of people in the U.S. right now; just review the CDC stats.  The average 40 year old Black woman is close to TWO HUNDRED POUNDS!   &mdash;  - AVERAGE!  The reason Whites are obese is due to the media promoting everything Blacks do as wonderful.  All one has to do is look at some White teenagers imitating Black dress, talk, tastes, and mannerisms, not to mention baggy clothes giving people tremendous room for growth in the weight area.  </p>

			<p>At first I thought this article sounded so silly that I almost didn&rsquo;t read it.   But on reflexion, it seems to me quite possible that people who feel unjustly treated (discriminated) and thus are depressed might take to drink a few more than they should have, or to compensate their hurt feelings (imagined or not) by seeking solace in food. So it would seem possible. It&rsquo;s well known that some people (many people) who lack love, feel rejected, or have empty lives often tend to become overeaters. But I don&rsquo;t see why this would apply to one race and not another. That doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me, and the article didn&rsquo;t explain it.</p>
<p>Of course, as other posters have pointed out, people who become overweight then also tend to be more loveless, discriminated against and rejected, so they eat even more to compensate!  It&rsquo;s a vicious circle that feeds upon itself.</p>
