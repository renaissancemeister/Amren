				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, October 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Massachusetts state Sen. Dianne Wilkerson was arrested by the FBI today and charged with accepting $23,500 in bribes from undercover agents she believed were local businessmen.</p>
<p>Wilkerson, the lone black member of the state Senate, was charged with attempted extortion as a public official and theft of honest services as a state senator. She faces up to 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines on each count.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilkerson, 53, lost the Democratic primary in September to Sonia Chang-Diaz, but was running a sticker campaign against her in the Nov. 4 election. She has held her seat in the Senate since 1993, but has faced a number of legal and ethical charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Between June 2007 and March 2008, Wilkerson allegedly took $8,500 in cash payments from an undercover agent and a cooperating witness to help a proposed nightclub in her district get a liquor license.</p>
<p>She allegedly pressured the Boston License Board, Mayor Thomas Menino and the City Council on behalf of the nightclub, and delayed legislation that would have increased the salaries of members of the licensing board.</p>
<p>Beginning in June, she allegedly accepted $15,000 in payments in exchange for helping an undercover officer posing as a businessman to avoid the bidding process to develop state property in Boston&rsquo;s Roxbury neighborhood.</p>
<p>The new charges are the latest in a string of troubles to plague the lawmaker. Despite the problems, Wilkerson remained popular in her Boston district and was supported in her primary bid by Menino and Gov. Deval Patrick.</p>

			<p>I find it strange that in a liberal race pandering state that elected a black governor, they had only one black state Senator, and will soon have none.</p>

			<p>If every congressmen or senator who accepted bribes of on sort or the other were subject to instant hanging, both houses would be able to meet at a neighbourhood coffee shop. The only difference between the whites and the blacks is that the whites are not quite as blatant and stupid.</p>

<p>One good thing to come out of that would be a determination to set up anti-corruption task forces to go after <i>all</i> elected officials, all the time.  Keep &#8216;em on their toes the entire time.</p>

			<p>Ms. Wilkerson is a crook. She was caught. </p>
<p>(1) The government probably has audio tapes and video tapes of the transactions.<br/>
(2) There will probably be testimony of undercover informants.<br/>
(3) There will probably be testimony of case agents.<br/>
(4) Her income and life style will be compared.<br/>
(5) Her bank accounts will be produced.<br/>
(6) Her checking accounts will be produced.<br/>
(7) The money&rsquo;s serial numbers were pre recorded.   </p>
<p>She is guilty.  </p>
<p>She will probably cut a deal for minimum time in a half way house</p>
<p>                               or</p>
<p>If she is tried and there are more than four blacks on the jury she will be acquitted.</p>
<p>MoMo</p>
<p>P.S. The reason why, of course, is obvious. Just look at her picture.<br/>

			<p>In ancient Rome, the penalty for a public official who took bribes was death.  The venal official would be sewn into a large sack with several wild cats and dumped into the Tiber River to drown while being clawed by the enraged cats.</p>
<p>I doubt she&rsquo;ll walk.  The feds have a conviction rate of approximately 98%.</p>

<p>Posted by Michael C. Scott at 2:02 PM on October 29 </p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>True. But the 98% deals with negotiated pleas for a downward departure in the guidelines. In actual trials the Feds do not fair as well; although better than state court prosecutors.</p>
<p>You are indeed correct however that this will be a plea and not a trial since the evidence, assuming the entrapment defense fails which it will, is overwhelming.</p>
<p>I expect that she will go to prison   &mdash;   the only question is for how long and where. Moreover, I doubt that she will go to a hard core federal prison.</p>
<p>But just my opinion, you probably know a lot more about this stuff than I. I defer to your expertise.</p>
