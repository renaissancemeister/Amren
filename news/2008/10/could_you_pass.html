<h1>Could You Pass the New Citizenship Test?</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Hanna, CNN, October 1, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>James Yarsiah listened to his college classmates discuss whether the civics component of the new U.S. naturalization test &mdash; which prospective citizens can start taking Wednesday &mdash; is more challenging than its predecessor.</p>
<p>Are new conceptual questions such as, &#8220;What does the Constitution do?&#8221; more difficult than old queries like &#8220;What is the Constitution?&#8221;</p>
<p>Is a question with a range of acceptable answers, such as the new &#8220;What is one reason colonists came to America?&#8221; preferable to the old &#8220;Why did the Pilgrims come to America?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some in Professor Robert King&rsquo;s American Government class, which examined sample questions of the old and the new civics tests at CNN.com&rsquo;s request Monday, had other opinions on how immigrants who weren&rsquo;t raised to speak English &mdash; or even U.S. citizens &mdash; might fare on the new version.</p>
<p>Many preferred the new test, which the government says includes more meaningful questions, such as those that involve a concept of, or critical thinking about, civics or history.</p>
<p>The new civics list, a pool of 100 possible questions for a test of up to 10, omits the old &#8220;How many stars are there on our flag?&#8221; and &#8220;Name the amendments that guarantee or address voting rights.&#8221; Taking their place are questions like: &#8220;There are four amendments to the Constitution about who can vote. Describe one of them,&#8221; and &#8220;What is one responsibility that is only for United States citizens?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others, including Ethiopia native Anteneh Workneh, addressed an issue that immigrant advocates have raised: Conceptual questions and answers might require a higher level of education and greater English-language dexterity.</p>
<p>He compared one question found on both tests &mdash; &#8221;The House of Representatives has how many voting members?&#8221; &mdash; with a new question: &#8220;Why do some states have more representatives?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The change</b></p>
<p>The old test will take a year to vanish. Anyone who applied for naturalization by Tuesday can choose either test if they take it by October 1, 2009. After that, only the new test will be given, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p>
<p>Anyone applying from Wednesday onward cannot take the old test.</p>
<p>Like the new civics exam, the old draws from a pool of more than 95 questions. Both ask applicants up to 10 questions, with applicants needing six correct to pass.</p>
<p>The test is not multiple-choice; applicants must know the answer directly and say it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Immigrant advocates: English, civics programs under-resourced</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She [Flavia Jimenez of the New Americans Initiative, a citizenship program of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights] said some new questions put people with lower levels of education and English skills at a disadvantage. Community groups that help immigrants prepare may need to explain certain concepts in their native languages and then work on English to express the answer, she said.</p>
<p>She said preparing some applicants for the concepts will require more time, straining under-resourced English and civics programs.</p>

			<p><i>Are new conceptual questions such as, &ldquo;What does the Constitution do?&rdquo; more difficult than old queries like &ldquo;What is the Constitution?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Well, yeah. The answer to the old question is, &#8220;The Constitution is (allegedly) the fundamental law of the land.&#8221; I&rsquo;m not sure about the answer to the new question. Answers such as &#8220;Not much,&#8221; or &#8220;Nothing it was intended to do,&#8221; probably wouldn&rsquo;t fly. I&rsquo;ll bet the examiners wouldn&rsquo;t much like &#8220;Nobody can interpret the Constitution but a group of nine high priests in black robes who translate it as if it were written in Aramaic. Nobody else really knows what it&rsquo;s supposed to do.&#8221; I&rsquo;d have to skip that question.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  -<br>
That would be good if it were true.  Both McCain and Obama run spanish language ads, which means there is a voting block of non English speakers big enough to invest money in contacting.  This is national suicide.</p>
<p>No one who cannot speak English should be allowed to be a citizen.  Actually, I don&rsquo;t think naturalized citizens should be allowed to vote at all.  Voting, like government, is best when constrained.  </p>

			<p>  I think the test is far too easy.<br>
  The USA does NOT need any more stupid people or people who do not understand and agree with what used to be called the American way of life and our basic rights, duties and laws.<br>
  People who do not understand these should not become citizens.<br>
  The USA is falling further behind because we have so many citizens who do not know what the basic civics of the country are and too many who do not value education enough to learn to read and understand what is being said.<br>
  Fewer than 1 out of 2 people I have to deal with is able to understand and follow simple written directions.  They cannot read, understand and follow simple directions. <br>
  Keep all the foreigners who cannot read, understand and follow directions out of the country. People who cannot do that are poor citizens unless you want a communist or other dictatorship. </p>

			<p>Better questions for the citizenship test should be:</p>
<p>What is your complexion?<br>
What is the function of the police?<br>
Why are prisons so full of blacks?  (trick question to weed out liberals)<br>
What is the legal age of consent?</p>
<p>Etc&hellip;</p>

			<p>Do we really need people here who cannot conceptualize and express an idea??  It will only drag us down as a nation!!<br>
As if we weren&rsquo;t already being dumbed-downed as it is &hellip;</p>
<p>Besides, what about all those vibrant immigrants who are supposed to &#8220;contribute&#8221; so much to our country?  How do they &#8220;contribute&#8221; when they can&rsquo;t even think?</p>
<p>This country is becoming one big, special-ed classroom!</p>

<p>These community groups are only creating jobs for the losers among us who get paid to keep this vicious cycle that is wrecking havoc on America going at the tax payers expense.</p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t help but wonder how relevant is it anyways? All you have to do is jump the border and head to a sanctuary city where all your friends are. And they speak your language. Eventually the mcamnesty wand gets waved and your a AMINO (American in name only). </p>

   One time a few years ago in Seattle, I got to know a Chinese lady at the bus stop.  I helped her study for her citizenship test.  It was good to see her sincerely want to better her English and assimilate into our country. </p>
<p>   Contrast her with the third world people who want to keep their language,  their culture and just take from America.  Surely it isn&rsquo;t too hard to weed out the bad from the good.  I just wish someone would take responsibility to do that.</p>

			<p>I saw this on FOX news. Ridiculously easy questions:</p>
<p>What does the Constitution do? How many Supreme Court justices? Who was the President during WWI?</p>
<p>The really sad thing is that most Americans would fail this test. A triumph for public education I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard at all.  They&rsquo;re bad and we&rsquo;re good. Simple as that.</p>
