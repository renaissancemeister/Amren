<p>As the bids on credit derivatives held by Lehman Brothers run 8.625 cents on the dollar, what is the mark-to-market value of the false inanities that have become the real currency of the United States?</p>
<p>Starting with demographics. Because of all the answers to any question at all that concerns the future of the United States, the most important is Demography is Destiny.</p>
<p>In 1965, America&rsquo;s ruling class decided that the problems with the black minority were not enough. This almost-vanilla ice cream needed more Tabasco. A country that was the envy of the world in every material and political area and many cultural ones as well, began the wholesale importation of the Third World onto its shores at the rate of over 1 million per year, not counting illegals, refugees and asylees. So now the ice cream is 1/3 Tabasco, and in two decades it will be 50%.</p>
<p>One wonders whether the inspiration for this came from the great success stories of the multicultural late-Roman, Russian or Austro-Hungarian Empires. The enthusiasm did not abate despite the fate of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, Rwanda, Kashmir and Iraq. Conclusions were not drawn from the story of Belgium&rsquo;s Flemish and Walloons   &mdash;   two peoples of the same race but of different languages, cultures and earning potentials, thrown together by historical fiat 170 years ago and still mutually loathing.</p>
<p>You deluge yourself with the population of banana republics, you will be a banana republic. You take in refugees from fufu dictatorships, you are tying the millstone of fufu dictatorship to your neck. You cannot bail yourself out of that one by printing dollar bills.</p>
<p>And yet, our governing class with its brand name mix of venality, cowardice and stupidity, continues throwing giant gobs of money onto a recession that&rsquo;s a diversity recession and that, ultimately, cannot recede except when diversity and the lies about it recede.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to end another deflationary fiction, about America&rsquo;s education recession. Throwing several trillion dollars more on the bonfire of education cannot improve it. America already spends twice to three times as much on education per student as dozens of countries do that far outrank it in scholastic achievement.</p>
<p>American schools are failing because they are full of sub-85-IQ imported children from unassimilable minorities. The schools cannot improve as long as they are controlled by cultural Marxists who believe that equality in ignorance is preferable to inequality in enlightenment. The added bonus is that if you produce generation after generation of ignorant malcontents full of self-esteem, you will succeed as well in staging the rest of the Gramscian scenario.</p>
<p>A nation that makes a relatively trivial logical fallacy and social pollutant such as racism into the ultimate capital crime cannot possibly survive. For where reality dwells, racism is down on the list and stupidity is at the top. In Robert Heinlein&rsquo;s words, &#8220;Stupidity is the only universal capital crime; the sentence is death, there is no appeal, and the execution is carried out automatically and without pity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unless he has been stung by a liberal encephalitis mosquito, anyone who has spent time among the nonwhites in the US or abroad knows that, in its obsession with white racism, the American society of 300 million is engaged in a collective act of moral masturbation the like of which may have no precedent in history, excepting China&rsquo;s pre-1976 cult of Mao and the EU&rsquo;s cult of Islam.</p>
<p>The brainwashing of 40 years has sent America&rsquo;s founding stock to cower in its ever-diminishing corners. The non-white, non-East Asian minorities march in a lockstep phalanx, smashing everything in their way with cries of racism and baseless accusations of discrimination. Now a crypto-Marxist &#8220;community organizer&#8221; will be elected, based on an uncountable stream of fraudulent nonwhite votes that just in the past week has resulted in these headlines: {snip}</p>

			<p>It is so true.  California is the proof of the horrors of third world immigration and minority favoritism.</p>
<p>From one of the 5 best school systems in the country in the early sixties to #  48 or 49 by the mid eighties. Only 20 years</p>
<p>Same schools, same curriculm, many of the same teachers.  What changed?? The students, from average IQ 100 to average IQ below 85 or as IQs below 90 used to be classified as &#8220;educable mentally retarded.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is so right about affirmative action. While other countries promote the very best, we promote the very worst to important positions.  </p>
<p>The engineering and computer firms refuse to hire Americans prefering to bring over employees from China and India.  And all our secrets go right back to China and India.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great article!!!!!! </p>

			<p>If you believe the liberal media, we are on the verge of a depression worse than the 1930&rsquo;s one due to the mortgage meltdown.</p>
<p>But never a word about the fact that these were affirmative action mortgages forced on the banks by Janet Reno&rsquo;s threats of draconian fines and billion dollar class action law suits.</p>
<p>Supposedly the world is on the brink of financial disaster because of our affirmative action mortgages.  But the minority mortgage brokers and the minority home buyers are never blamed.</p>

			<p>This is the type of article you print out.  The type of article in which you save (archive) several copies, not just one.  It&rsquo;s the type of article you pass on to family and friends.  It&rsquo;s a momento to remind you that there are other people out there that think just like you.  Exactly like you without the apologies.</p>

OMG!   What a terrific article.  Right on the money!   I can&rsquo;t wait to see what comments  Bon and Schoolteacher have to say about it.</p>
<p>That &#8220;ruling class&#8221; has never failed to foul its own nest.  Now, a few of them are getting nervous and starting to have second thoughts, but it&rsquo;s rather late. The damage their avid social engineers have wrought is done.</p>

			<p>Ms. Seiyo, I wasn&rsquo;t aware that Asians were part of the founding population.  </p>
<p>I think these populations are imported into this country in a deliberate attempt to destroy the United States while at the same time making a quick buck off the cheap labor.  We have 50 trillion dollars in unfunded debt (mostly social security and medicare) looming over the horizon.  We are headed for disaster since their is no way we can pay this.  Consider the world&rsquo;s economic output combined is a little over 54 trillion and you quickly realize their is no way we can grow that fast!  Millions of imported aliens working minimum wage jobs won&rsquo;t make any difference.  America is no longer profitable and the elites are liquidating it.</p>

			<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with this article. He says it all. I notice that he mentions Heinlein. He is my favorite author by far. If you have not read &#8216;Starship Troopers&rsquo;, do so. It is a primer on the role of government, individual responsibility, duty, the right to vote and hold citizenship, etc. It is not the unholy mess that Hollywood turned out. I promise that if you read the first chapter you will not be able to put it down. By the way, Heinlein&rsquo;s most famous quote is, &#8220;There ain&rsquo;t no free lunch.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;After all, Perot, Buchanan and Paul have diagnosed the illness correctly, yet the electorate went with the greater fools.&#8221;</p>
<p>How true that is.  Any of the above three men could get this country pretty well straightened out in about 8 years if they were in office, but the electorate refuses to nominate those kinds of men as presidential contenders.  </p>
<p>Just look at this last nomination process.  With the exception of Paul and Tancredo, neither of which had a chance, there wasn&rsquo;t anybody nominated who was really anything but more of the same.</p>
<p>Personally, I just don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s enough aware white Americans in this country who have the knowledge and judgement to nominate anybody, but a behind the scenes party pic, like Bush, McCain, etc.</p>
<p>We need people in the Congress and the White House who are people from every possible walk of life, because all we&rsquo;ve been getting is out-of-touch, arrogant lawyers, professional students, or people who have no experience in the real world.</p>
<p>Our government was intended to be a government of the people, not of the privileged.</p>
<p>I really believe that America in its present form is finished, and the next couple of years will prove just that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter who might be in office as president.<br>

			<p>Our demise isn&rsquo;t being done out of stupidity but through cold calculated moves by our elites to destroy the country.  Think about it. This whole process of inundating America with third world hordes weakens the White elite&rsquo;s power over the country.  At some point when Whites become a minority, the nonwhite elites will overthrow them and pursue their own power brokering.  It&rsquo;s already happening.   </p>

			<p>The economic crises that we are going through now, will be nothing compared to the crises a year from now, 5, and 10 years<br>
in the future. It is because now 1/3 of the US population is<br>
now non white, 95% because of the immigration act of 1965 that<br>
favors the third world.  Many with IQ&rsquo;s of 70, and less.<br>
All they are, are consumers. Take their weekly earnings and<br>
spend it at Wally World. No thought of savings. These people<br>
will mostly be living off welfare, and government aid, and<br>
grants. Did you know that despite the economic crises, and<br>
threats of more bank failures, the banks still have to make<br>
loans to illegal Mexicans, and blacks on welfare, or they will<br>
be threaten to be sued for discrimination by the government.<br>
As their population increases, so will economic hard ships<br>
will continue to grow, until we become Brazil, a wealthy class, whom will be hoarding all the wealth.<br>
A small managerial middle class that will be the highly paid<br>
arm forces, and masses of poverty, in which the only the<br>
strong will survives. Welfare, handouts will be passe.</p>

Derivatives are right up there with &#8216;junk bond&rsquo; which told you all you needed to known in their name and yet people still jumped all over them because the confidence men (wall street investment brokers, aka con men) convinced people they were a great deal.</p>
<p>Nothing produced and yet profits continued to rise. There was nothing lost because nothing was ever produced. Formulas on paper produces wealth worth the paper it&rsquo;s written on. Wealth is produced where you have production. Where is there production? In China which now has the wealth.</p>
<p>Everyone is to blame for this because everyone wanted to believe they could produce wealth from formulas on paper. As long as everyone believed the system was sound and working, it appeared to. Then reality kicks and some party pooper asks &#8216;where are the physical assets&rsquo; and then everyone realizes they&rsquo;re only holding paper. Crash.</p>
<p>We have financial, social, and racial problems because they&rsquo;re all based on theories and speculation. No one is allowed to ask, &#8216;what if the experts are wrong.&rsquo; Those people are labeled financial naysayers and socially as racists. We live in a world where BELIEVING the systems we promote are working or, if given enough time, money, and resources, will work is more important than acknowledging they aren&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>In the fight between theory and reality, reality always wins.</p>
<p>The financial crash has come. When, why, and how the race crash will happen is anyones guess but theory does not trump reality.</p>

			<p>      That a few East Asians, mostly Japanese, have any compas-<br>
sion at all for us, is gratifying. But such feelings will not pre<br>
vent their countrymen from pillaging us. China in her fall was<br>
being divided up by the great powers? Never like this. Never was<br>
their very population threatened by dispossesion by Whites. Mr<br>
Takuan has great insight, but he excludes the role East Asians<br>
will play in the destruction of America. They have already played<br>
a great role but passively through the treason of our Elites. Now<br>
the time has come when they move as conquerors. How not? We have<br>
given them the best that we had, jobs, techology, the secrets of<br>
nuclear power, and bombs&hellip;Why not? Well Mr Takuan&rsquo;s compassion<br>
doesn&rsquo;t reach that far. He obviously sees it as natural that his<br>
people should assume control since we have botched it. We used<br>
to feel the same way about East Asians. Only one clergyman, I<br>
forget his name, urged caution at the time. He said of China, <br>
&#8220;Let the Dragon sleep&#8221;. <br>
      As for Robert Heinlein: he was good for his time. He bel-<br>
ieved in the American Way and urged that men fight for it. He was also, alas, a proto-Libertarian. He thought the border bet-<br>
ween Mexico and the United States should be dismantled to facil-<br>
itate jobs and trade. As I said, a man of his time. I think highly of him and I think he would repent of this if he saw what<br>
it actually has lead to. The same with race. He thought Blacks<br>
might be equal but had never been given a chance. He would think<br>
differently now.</p>

			<p>There is one important point that this article has not stressed enough.  Superior genes cannot interbreed with inferior genes.  The end result is the superior genes are regressed and diluted.  This was the undoing of all past advanced civilizations.  The Ayrans (pre-white) of India tried to prevent the interbreeding by the caste system but to no avail.  The Ayrans&rsquo; very superior genes are still in the existing population today.  This is reason why India has some scientific abilities but because inferior genes are the majority it&rsquo;s abilities as a nation are capped.  </p>
<p>This country had finanical meltdowns in the past but it was always able to pick itself back up.  But this will not happen if inferior genes are the majority which it appears this country is heading and with inferior genes holding significant positions of power.</p>
<p>One last note, it is a sign of the decay of this country that a black man without anykind of substance could be the President of<br>
USA. </p>

<p>I suppose that from the distant perspective of Japan he is able to observe with an undistorted view the great bonfire, the incredible spectacle, of the  self-immolation of the USA  (and of the  entire suicidal West). </p>

<p>East Indians have low IQs and have much sub-Saharan African admixture in them.  Despite the few drops of Aryan blood, East Indians are still mostly South Asian and African.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like to apologize ahead of time if there are some non-whites that I might be offending but I must make a comment based on years of observation. So many of the non-whites that have come into this nation, either legally or illegally over the past 35 years or so, are utterly corrupt. They hide income, they lie, they cheat and they do it all within a vast familial and cultural structure. We know the examples but just to cite a few, massage parlors that aren&rsquo;t, real estate deals that violate normal real estate laws and ethics, cheating in school,(oh, yes!!, even when I went to school some moons ago, many Asians for example, excluding Japanese, literally got eye strain trying to see some other students answers)getting welfare for aging parents, when your here illegally and are rich, and on and on. I&rsquo;m sure AmRen readers are aware of many more examples. Again, I apologize if you do not fall into this category.</p>

<p>That is so true.  Here is an example of a Chinese real estate scheme.  I was at Kinko&rsquo;s with a big job one afternoon. The place was crowded.  They told me it would take at least an hour.</p>
<p>That Kinko&rsquo;s has comfy chairs, free coffee and newspapers so I decided to wait till the job was done.  Pretty soon I heard a voice asking me if I was a native speaker.  That is how foreigners ask Americans to translate things.  I hear it all the time and I do translate for them.</p>
<p>This was a late middle aged Chinese woman.  She told me that she could speak and understand English well (true)but could hardly read it.  She asked me to read some things she had just run off the copier.</p>
<p>So I read her lawsuits out loud to her. She was defendant in 2 lawsuits brought by the bank that had given her mortgages. This is what happened.</p>
<p>(1) She bought 2 small apartment houses, one for 2 million something the other for 3 million something using as  down payments not cash, but a deed of trust on another piece of property she owned.  Fine, it happens a lot.</p>
<p>(2) After about 18 months she stopped paying the mortgage but still was collecting substantial rents on those buildings which were in a desirable, expensive suburb of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>(3) The bank began forclosure proceedings.  She gave the buildings to her 2 brothers as a &#8220;family gift&#8221; which complicated things.  Apparently she and her brothers were smart enough to think up the scam but didn&rsquo;t realize that mortgages are on the real estate, not on the owner of the property.</p>
<p>(4)  So the bank, Glendale Federal Savings investigated more throughly.  Bank investigators discovered that:</p>
<p>(5) She never owned the properties she used as down payment.  But she did have valid deeds of trust on those properties.  How did this happen?  Simple</p>
<p>(6) Her brothers established a Title and Trust Company solely for the purpose of issuing fraudulent deeds of trust to other Chinese so they could buy their mansions and apartment houses with no down payment.</p>
<p>Now that really is advanced corruption.  Faking a down payment is one thing, but going to the trouble of establishing a Title and Trust Company for the sole purpose of issuing false deeds of trust is unbelievable.</p>
<p>And stuff like this goes on all the time in areas afflicted with immigrants from civilizations that have been corrupt for 5,000 years.</p>

<p>Another example of Chinese ethics.  This has been going on since the 1930&rsquo;s in California.</p>
<p>A sweatshop or restaurant owner will create a fake employee, say Linda Lee.  He will pay into the unemployment fund for her.  Of course he doesn&rsquo;t pay any other payroll taxes for his actual employees.  He is very aware of just how long and how much to get the highest unemployment checks.</p>
<p>When the time has been reached, Linda Lee is laid off for lack of work. His wife or other family member goes to the unemployment office with a Linda Lee fake ID and collects the unemployment check for 6 or 9 months.  It used to be a bit cumbersome, but nowadays it is all done over the internet.  It is very, very wide spread in Asian businesses.</p>
<p>They always have numerous ghost employees building up unemployment credits.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chinese ethics, I stopped eating in Asian restaurants long ago. Not only did I get stomach flu, but I honestly believe that much of the meat they serve is not what it is labelled.  Probably they substitute sea gull for chicken, cat or even worse for beef and pork.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason for all that garlic, ginger, pepper and soy sauce.  </p>
<p>Recently there was something about a hispanic women in Nevada who did the same unemployment benefit fraud thing.  Only she didn&rsquo;t own a real business.  She just created a paperwork sole ownership business and got away with about $375,000 three hundred and seventy five hundred thousand dollars, more than 1/3rd of a million.  She was finally caught.</p>
<p>Then there was the Santa Monica community college calculas teacher who found that Asians were paying other Asians to take the calculas class for them.  He noticed that the same people appeared every semester under different names.</p>
<p>There are plenty of professional test takers around. And they do take the qualifying tests for everything from registered nurse to Oracle certificate for others.</p>
<p>I wonder how many of those extremely high SAT and ACT scores were achieved by professional test takers.</p>
<p>it just goes on and on and on.</p>

			<p>Yes, Bobby at 7:31 PM, AmRen readers are aware of many more examples of foreigners cheating.  I took a civil service exam many years ago, and I still remember the worried looks on the faces of the Orientals when the Black, female proctors separated them.  Yep, those fat, resentful bottom-level clerks on Saturday overtime were merciless, and with good reason.  One of the few times I&rsquo;ve seen Blacks do their jobs with gusto.  &#8220;You, sit over there!&#8221;    <br>
     Down the street from me, an apartment was torn down and a cul de sac with six houses put in its place.  The prices were utterly outrageous, absurd to imagine paying so much.  I knew the local property values.  But, they all quickly sold, to Chinese, every one of them.   Of course, the houses had been advertised in the Chinese media, with the real price.  Illegal for Whites to do that, but Chinese discrimination is ignored.  <br>
     If we ever decide to deport all foreigners who have violated the civil statutes, there won&rsquo;t be many Chinese left.  They are to the civil code what Blacks are to the criminal codes.<br>

			<p>A beautiful, powerful article. It belongs with Raspail&rsquo;s &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221;, and Enoch Powell&rsquo;s 1968 speech to the British Parliament.</p>
<p>Who cares if &#8220;Tachaun Seiyo&#8221; is a pen name for a writer born in Eastern Europe? Washington Irving was the pen name for Dietrich Knickerbocker, and Saki the pen name for H.H. Munro.</p>
<p>The writer gave birth to a new lexicon, one that I believe will take off, especially with the coming regime change.</p>
<p>Moral masturbation.</p>
<p>Seiyo didn&rsquo;t define it, but I think it can be thought of as &#8220;anything done to make oneself feel good, despite harmful consequences, from a moral or ethical standpoint&#8221;. Examples would include embracing multiculturalism, elevating &#8220;racism&#8221; to a capital crime, downplaying or dismissing physical, mental or cultural differences between peoples, to making excuses for the worst criminals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure every poster here on Amren, can think of their own definitions/examples of moral masturbation.</p>
<p>So John PM, or Bon Bon, the next time you hear someone extoll the virtues of AA, tell them straight out that they&rsquo;re engaging in moral masturbation.   </p>

			<p>margaret, thank you for the deeply inforative information on some of the scams pulled by many of our fine non-white immigrants. You informed me of things I wasn&rsquo;t even aware of and I though I knew alot about it. Oh well, the general attitude in this nation lately has been Que sera sera, what will be will be. Who am I to buck the trend? However, every action good or bad, had it&rsquo;s corresponding reaction. As the nation becomes more and more morally crippled, we will surely reap the consequences for our apathy one way or the another. Thanks again, margaret. </p>

			<p>Astounding. You folks run an article that sounds like the worst excesses of &#8216;White supremacist&rsquo; stuff, yet, because it is a non-White writing, [Takuan Seiyo] and because of &#8216;who we support&rsquo;  being blatantly posted on their website, you dare to include it as if it were your voice speaking- the voice of oppressed Christendom.</p>
<p>For THAT was what the &#8220;Gates of Vienna&#8221; were all about- the battle of Lepanto, the Chesterton poem, and the routing of the paynim foe from Christian Europe- which included certain Asiatics never mentioned in a negative light on this forum, BTW.</p>
<p>A little more disingenuousness, please. I believe the cup of wrath is only half full&hellip;.</p>
