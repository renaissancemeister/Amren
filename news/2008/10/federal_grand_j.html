<h1>Federal Grand Jury Indicts Suspect in Carson Murder</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, October 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal grand jury on Monday indicted one of two men accused in the slaying of the student body president at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, adding on to state murder charges.</p>
<p>Demario Atwater, 22, was indicted on one count of carjacking resulting in death, and carrying and using firearms during and in relation to carjacking, both of which could allow federal authorities to seek a death sentence.</p>
<p>State prosecutors had already charged both Atwater and Laurence Lovette, 17, with murder in the March 5 death of Eve Carson, 22, of Athens, Ga. Her body was found early that morning in the middle of a residential street near the school&rsquo;s campus. She had been shot five times, including once in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun.</p>
<p>Atwater already faces the death penalty if convicted on state murder charges. Lovette can&rsquo;t be sentenced to death in either state or federal court because the crime was committed before he turned 18.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey must approve seeking a death sentence in the federal case. Prosecutors said Monday he has yet to do so. The federal indictment also charges Atwater with being a felon in possession of firearms and possessing a short-barreled shotgun that had not been properly registered to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both federal and state law violations are implicated in the tragic events of March 5, 2008, and we will vigorously prosecute the violations of federal law committed in connection with the death of Eve Marie Carson,&#8221; Anna Mills Wagoner, the U.S. Attorney for the middle district of North Carolina, said in a statement.</p>

<i>[Editor&rsquo;s Note: This story is included here because the two murders occurred within a day of each other. The murder of Eve Carson has tended to get more news, but the news editor does not wish Lauren Burks&rsquo;s murder to be forgotten merely because there has been less coverage. ]</i>
</blockquote>
<p>The man accused of killing an Auburn University student in March has been indicted on three capital murder charges.</p>
<p>Courtney Lockhart was also indicted on a charge of robbing a business in his Smiths Station hometown.</p>
<p>The Auburn student, 18-year-old Lauren Burk, was killed on March 4. She was found lying in the roadway on Alabama Highway 147 and died of a gunshot wound at a local hospital.</p>

			<p>I didn&rsquo;t even have to look at the pictures to know that the perp in this murder case, WAS BLACK&hellip;.WHAT ELSE IS NEW??? Now the question is, will he get just a slap on the wrist or go to jail for like 60 days??? I&rsquo;m betting on the slap on the wrist&hellip;.after all he is BLACK and the poor girl was WHITE!</p>

			<p>The picture of Courtney is poignant. Leftists talk about society failing people  &mdash;  -YEP. Much of that failure is due to the excesses of their false philosophy.</p>

			<p>Forgive my first post. I said Courtney, the monster who perpetrated this crime, rather than Lauren. The picture or her simply rattled me.</p>

			<p>These incidents give accurate, stark examples as to why blacks were hung by whites years ago.</p>
<p>Justice for atrocities such as these and other outrageous black on white crimes came swift with no nonsense in yesteryear.</p>
<p>How convenient it is for blacks to cite the lynchings without admitting they were in fact justice for vicious black crimes.  </p>

			<p>Every one of these murderous thugs should be put to death, and speedily, not 20 years in the future. These lovely young women were college students, looking forward to becoming productive American citizens,and their future was brutally stolen from them. Society needs to be shown that this will not be tolerated especially when uncivlized blacks prey on white people.</p>

			<p>I would like to know what the racial mind set of the parents and family of these murdered girls was before these atrocities were committed on their daughters/sons by these blacks, and what the mindset is now.</p>

			<p>&#8220;How convenient it is for blacks to cite the lynchings without admitting they were in fact justice for vicious black crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, lynching is common.  From South Africa, with its &#8216;necklacing&rsquo;, to Nigeria where mobs ritually execute suspected witches, to Kenya where petty criminals and rival tribesmen are beaten to death, to Somalia where adulterers are stoned to death in the name of Islam, virtually all of the dark continent is subject to mobs lynching unfortunates.</p>
<p>The ritual aspect is important.  Rather than being a totally irrational act, lynching speaks to the African mind as a form of social control that offsets unfettered primal instincts.  It is a cathartic experience for people looking for some visible sign of power and order in the world.</p>

			<p>  This crime was senseless and utterly savage, and yet I&rsquo;m sure that many liberals would oppose the death penalty for Mr. Lockhart.  </p>

			<p>A speedy execution for these monsters would be gratifying, but the prospect of them rotting in prison for over a decade before being turned off isn&rsquo;t all bad.  As someone who has done prison time, I know exactly what it is like.</p>
<p>These creeps having to miss their mothers&rsquo; cooking, having to miss being able to drive to the store to buy whatever they want, having to miss being able to wear their own clothes, having to miss a decent cup of coffee with breakfast, a nice glass of beer with dinner and all the other things people who have never been locked up take for granted is part of justice.</p>
<p>Let them rot, and THEN execute them.</p>

			<p>A war against whites is being waged daily,and nobody seems to care. Well i do care and what needs to be done is white organizations have to work together and if nessesary travel to protest these types of crimes. It doesn&rsquo;t do any good to have five or ten people show up,you need five hundred or a thousand to show up, that is what white America needs to see.</p>
