						<p>Growing inequality in US cities could lead to widespread social unrest and increased mortality, says a new United Nations report on the urban environment.</p>
<p>In a survey of 120 major cities, New York was found to be the ninth most unequal in the world and Atlanta, New Orleans, Washington, and Miami had similar inequality levels to those of Nairobi, Kenya Abidjan and Ivory Coast. Many were above an internationally recognised acceptable &#8220;alert&#8221; line used to warn governments.</p>
<p>&#8220;High levels of inequality can lead to negative social, economic and political consequences that have a destabilising effect on societies,&#8221; said the report. &#8220;[They] create social and political fractures that can develop into social unrest and insecurity.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the annual State of the World&rsquo;s cities report from UN-Habitat, race is one of the most important factors determining levels of inequality in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;In western New York state nearly 40% of the black, Hispanic and mixed-race households earned less than $15,000 compared with 15% of white households. The life expectancy of African-Americans in the US is about the same as that of people living in China and some states of India, despite the fact that the US is far richer than the other two countries,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Disparities of wealth were measured on the &#8220;Gini co-efficient&#8221;, an internationally recognised measure usually only applied to the wealth of countries. The higher the level, the more wealth is concentrated in the hands of fewer people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear that social tension comes from inequality. The trickle down theory [that wealth starts with the rich] has not delivered. Inequality is not good for anybody,&#8221; said Anna Tibaijuka, head of UN-Habitat, in London yesterday.</p>
<p>The report found that India was becoming more unequal as a direct result of economic liberalisation and globalisation, and that the most unequal cities were in South Africa and Namibia and Latin America. &#8220;The cumulative effect of unequal distribution [of wealth] has been a deep and lasting division between rich and poor. Trade liberalisation did not bring about the expected benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report suggested that Beijing was now the most egalitarian city in the world, just ahead of cities such as Jakarta in Indonesia and Dire Dawa in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>In Europe, which was generally more egalitarian than other continents, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Slovenia were classed as the most equal countries with Greece, the UK and Spain among the least. &#8220;Disparities are particularly significant in the cities of eastern Europe, larger Spanish cities and in the north of England,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>It documents the seemingly unstoppable move of people away from rural to urban areas. This year it is believed that the number of people living in urban areas exceeded those in the countryside for the first time ever, but the report says there is no sign of the trend slowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dramatic transition between rural and urban communities is not over. Urbanisation levels will rise dramatically in the next 40 years to reach 70% by 2050,&#8221; it predicts.</p>
<p>The most dramatic urbanisation has been taking place in China, with many millions of people moving from the countryside to cities. The report says 49 new cities have been built in the past 18 years. The rapid transition to an urban society has brought great wealth but also many negative results.</p>
<p>&#8220;China has attained some of the deepest disparities in the world with urban incomes three times those in rural areas. Inequalities are growing, with disproportionate rewards for the most skilled workers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and serious problems for the unemployed and informal workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urban growth rates are highest in the developing world, which absorbs an average 5 million new urban residents a month and is responsible for 95% of world urban growth. The report predicts that Asian cities will grow the most in the next 40 years and could have 63% of the world urban population by 2050.</p>
<p>Tokyo is expected to remain the world&rsquo;s largest mega city, with 36.4m people by 2025. But Mexico City, New York, and Sao Paulo could give way in the league table to Mumbai, Delhi and Dhaka. Kinshasa and Lagos are the two African cities expected to grow the most, with each adding more than 6 million people by 2025.</p>
<p>Rather than countryside to city movement, which has marked rapid population growth in the last 40 years, the UN expects more people to move from city to city.</p>
<p>Capital cities in particular are attracting much more of countries&rsquo; investments and are growing fast. Some are becoming home to nearly half a country&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>But the report also identified what it believes is the emergence of a new urban trend, with many cities now shrinking in size. The populations of 46 countries, including Germany, Italy, Japan and most former soviet states, are expected to be smaller in 2050 than they are now, and in the past 30 years, says the report, more cities in the developed world have shrunk than grown.</p>
<p>It found that 49 cities in the UK, including Liverpool and other old industrial centres in the north of England, and 100 in Russia reduced in size between 1990 and 2000, mainly because of unemployment. In the US 39 cities are smaller now than they were 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The reasons for the decline of cities was mostly economic, but the report says that the environment is now an important factor.</p>
<p>Air quality and pollution from mines, power plants and oil exploration have been responsible for population losses in India, Mexico and Africa, it says. &#8220;Cities tend to struggle most with health-threatening environmental issues, such as the lack of safe water, sanitation and waste.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<i>[Editor&rsquo;s Note: Whether or not Beijing is the most egalitarian place in the world, readers may want to reacquaint themselves with one of its policies during the Olympics.

<p>This leaves out some crucial stats: blacks and hispanics have much higher rates of out of wedlock births, and much higher levels of violent criminal behavior. Single family households lead to lower standards of living. Criminal behavior leads to prison, which undermines long term economic earnings (to put it mildly). it also leads to lower life expectancy.</p>
<p>Blacks and hispanics have much higher school drop-out rates which reflects less emphasis on education in their households. </p>
<p>Many hispanics are in the USA illegally, again, with all sorts of implications for earning power. (Not to mention competing with blacks for low-end jobs.)</p>
<p>Does the UN look at these factors which are directly the result of the choices that blacks and hispanics make? </p>
<p>The UN might also look at high-earning blacks and hispanics to see what factors worked for them. Of course, the conclusions of just about any UN study are going to be predetermined by the political assumptions at the start. This report comes down to just one more hatchet job against the USA.</p>

			<p>Excessive wealth inequality, whether between robber barons and workers in the 19th and 20th centuries, or between super-capitalists, workers and the poor in the 21st century, and unjust and unacceptable in a truly free and democratic society.</p>
<p>Freedom does not mean the freedom to exploit, oppress, or fleece your fellow human beings out of a fair share of the fruits of their labor, or of subsistence level resources for the poor, infirm or unemployed.</p>
<p>A society will always be judged by the way it treats it&rsquo;s elderly, it&rsquo;s children, it&rsquo;s disabled, and it&rsquo;s poor.</p>
<p>Any society which oppresses, neglects or harms it&rsquo;s weak members is an unjust and contemptable society.</p>
<p>Any society which uplifts, loves and heals it&rsquo;s weak members is a just and admirable society.</p>
<p>Which kind of society and world do you want to live in?</p>

			<p>The UN wants a piece of America so bad they can taste it. That we will not kneel to their idea of one world government must gall them endlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is clear that social tension comes from inequality.&#8221; </p>
<p>Did Marx say that? Perhaps there are other reasons for the &#8216;tension&rsquo;? I have neighbors who are much wealthier than I, and neighbors who have much less, and yet there are no tensions between us. Same throughout my entire town. Hmm, what other reasons might there be? Could it be that I am blessed living in a mono-cultural White community, with virtually NO diversity?</p>
<p>&#8220;Inequality is not good for anybody,&rdquo; said Anna Tibaijuka, head of UN-Habitat, in London yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow. Now let me think&hellip;what good might come from making us all more equal, and how many successful examples can they point to? How was such a &#8216;solution&rsquo; put into practice, and what was the impact on the inhabitants? How long before such expansive government intrusion evolved into something that was less benevolent than originally planned? I am having trouble coming up with a happy outcome where such interventions have been attempted.</p>
<p>Personally, Anna, I am not ready to give up my freedom to NOT be equal. Love it. Nothing drives an economy or nourishes the spirit like freedom. Even with its unpredictability, and the lack of guarantees, nothing else succeeds like liberty and nothing flourishes in its absence. </p>
<p>IMHO this organization no longer has any relation to its original intent, and is of no benefit whatsoever to America. I agree with the Tancredo resolution. No objection to terminating all dialog and all their welfare checks immediately.  Eviction notices to be delivered right after that.<br>

			<p>This sort of rubbish is yet another reason why the United Nations should be moved to the North Pole while the United States quietly backs out of the room.</p>
<p>People are by no means equal across the world, nor is the land they live on. Skills, experience, education, and a thousand other attributes make it impossible for people to have the same income or wealth.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be possible for all people to be equally poor by allowing the government to take away all private property other than what the poorest person has. (Ha Ha&hellip;..that is funny.)</p>
<p>Infinite human variety guarnatees that there will always be a disparity in wealth and income. I dare say it is necessary for an effeciently operating economy. It makes no sense at all to expect a gifted chemical engineer to work as a fruit picker any more than a gifted fruit picker should try his hand at chemical engineering.</p>
<p>Egalitarian nonsense!</p>

			<p>The Guardian is a left-wing rag.</p>
<p>&#8220;the seemingly unstoppable move of people away from rural to urban areas&#8221;   </p>
<p>As demands for goods falls, Chinese factories are locking their doors, and workers are heading back to the countryside. Where people have no countryside to go back to, there will be the &#8216;time bomb&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Interesting.  Those are the most liberal cities in America, all run by hard left liberals. Atlanta, New Orleans and Washington are more 80 percent black.  Every elected, appointed and civil service official and employee is an affirmative action black.  So how can these cities be such failures?  Was not evil whitey driven out long ago?</p>
<p>About 40 percent of New York&rsquo;s population is foreign born, about as it ws 100 years ago at the height of immigration. And most of the foreign born are hispanic, african and african diaspora, middle eastern, all the most disfunctional countries in the world.</p>
<p>The Miami cubans turned Miami into the corrupt Havana they fled 45 years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Atlanta, New Orleans, Washington, and Miami had similar inequality levels to those of Nairobi, Kenya Abidjan and Ivory Coast.&#8221;  Naturally, the same race who populates the african cities populates Atlanta, Washington and Miami.</p>
<p>I am sure the cities and towns with the least income inequality are solid white republican conservative cities.  At least until the local businessmen bring in third worlders to take jobs from the citizens.</p>

			<p>Oh here we go, the UN is setting the stage for future interventions in the United States to enforce &#8220;global&#8221; standards of &#8220;social justice&#8221;.  If Senator Obama is elected do any of you doubt that he would invite UN monitors and security personnel into the United States to enforce the implementation of &#8220;social justice&#8221; and wealth redistribution schemes that he &#8220;can&rsquo;t trust the historic racist and obstructionist elements of American society&#8221; to enforce?</p>

			<p>The US should pull all funding for the UN.</p>
<p>Under McCain, this would eventually happen.  Part of his set of goals for his first term is to create a parallel coalition that ONLY includes western democracies and specifically excludes all others&hellip;.to function much as the UN does now.  Such an organization would RAPIDLY co-opt the UN and make it irrelevant.  Soon after, the US would stop funding them.  Within weeks, it would dissolve.</p>
<p>Contrast that with what Obama plans to do&hellip;.slice off a sizeable portion of our GNP and hand it over to them as a tax.  One could only wonder at the mischief that would result.</p>

			<p>An interesting article, to be sure!</p>
<p>But some sentences really stand out as being idiotic, so lets go through the worst of them.</p>
<p>The  most pernicious for me, were of course these:</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the annual State of the World&rsquo;s cities report from UN-Habitat, race is one of the most important factors determining levels of inequality in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>&#8216;In western New York state nearly 40% of the black, Hispanic and mixed-race households earned less than $15,000 compared with 15% of white households. The life expectancy of African-Americans in the US is about the same as that of people living in China and some states of India, despite the fact that the US is far richer than the other two countries,&rsquo; it said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here we again have the fecklessly wretched UN making &#8220;racism&#8221; inferences on the part of those &#8220;of color,&#8221; when they should be asking questions regarding why the higher levels of &#8220;achievement&#8221; for nonwhites exist in the majority white USA and Canada, but not countries where they make up the majority; and how it is that such &#8220;racist&#8221; countries, allow a majority of nonwhites better economic opportunities over any percentage of the white population? While I do not have the population statistics for &#8220;western New York state,&#8221; why don&rsquo;t we apply their implications through example and of course the UN&rsquo;s accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221; to the country as a whole, just for fun?</p>
<p>Roughly, the USA has 300 million people, 200 million white and 100 million nonwhite. 15% of 200 million is 30 million people and 40% of 100 million is of course 40 million people; combined the two groups are nearly equal to the white poor and the white population of poor is almost equal to the entire black and Hispanic populations as separate groups in this country (35 million blacks and 40 million Hispanics approximately.) We cannot, for brevity&rsquo;s sake, calculate how and by what criteria &#8220;mixed-race&#8221; households or individuals play into this dynamic, simply because we do not have the ever &#8220;truthful&#8221; and &#8220;exhaustive&#8221; UN&rsquo;s parameters on these issues/standards. Thus, it is safe to hold for the purposes of my speculations, that a &#8220;mixed-race&#8221; household is given the bleakest of assessments possible and evens out in relation to all other non-mixed groupings, regardless if it is some fat white whore on welfare with 20 illegitimate mixed and white children, or a black and Hispanic mixed household with 2 children and married parents who actually do work. That might not be the statistically best (it certainly isn&rsquo;t) way to interpret or vary data, but it is what I am restricted to at the moment, thanks to the UN&rsquo;s sterling reports of their own classifications and findings. </p>
<p>With all that considered, I am left with one burning question: why is it that any white poor exist in this country that is so &#8220;racist&#8221; and steeped in &#8220;white privilege,&#8221; while substantial proportions of those &#8220;of color&#8221; are allowed to thrive at their expense?  Here, we (or they) cannot use &#8220;free market&#8221; or &#8220;race as a social construct&#8221; theories to explain away the problem of racial economic disparity (unless you hold that the 30 million white poor must exist, so that 60 million nonwhites can thrive and that 200 million poor whites, or so, would equal economic &#8220;equality&#8221; for nonwhites)  and then deny that our country and Canada has done something in terms of social-engineering to replace &#8220;racism,&#8221; with &#8220;equal opportunities&#8221; of a sort in seeking &#8220;equality&#8221; between the races. </p>
<p>Or put another way, why is that elite &#8220;racist&#8221; whites allow any reduction of their &#8220;white privileges&#8221; at any level, even if it means oppressing nonwhites&rsquo; &#8220;best and brightest,&#8221; against the interests of their lesser &#8220;racist&#8221; white brothers and sisters? </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>Most working people&rsquo;s &#8220;wealth&#8221; is the result of living beneath one&rsquo;s means and investing for the long term. This is an anathema to the typical African-American who&rsquo;s general motto for life is &#8220;Let the Good Times Roll!&#8221; and if something happens, government will tax the stupid non-black producers in order to, as Barack Obama states: &#8220;Spread the Wealth!&#8221;</p>

			<p>I always find articles like this funny.  The author clearly sees that race is an issue, clearly identifies where the problem takes place, but fails to link cause with correlation. </p>
<p>Among the most unequal places in the world are India, South Africa, Namibia, and Latin America eh?</p>
<p>I wonder what all of those places have in common?  Could it be White (Brahman in India) middle and upper class minorities amongst a huge population of non-Whites?</p>
<p>In Europe, the still somewhat less &#8220;diverse&#8221; Scandinavian countries are at the top of equality, yet the UK with it&rsquo;s contemporary massive influx of immigrants and Spain and Greece with their more dated non-White immigration influx are at the bottom.  Same is true in US cities mentioned here.</p>
<p>I recall taking a class on global political economy, where countries were grouped as the &#8220;Developed North&#8221; (although Australia/NZ somehow fit in here) or the &#8220;Underdeveloped South&#8221; (Bolivia, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Cameroon etc. etc).  Progressively &#8216;developing&rsquo; countries were ones like Brazil, South Africa, India, Russia, etc.  Notice any trends?</p>
<p>This author recognizes race as an issue, but fails to mention why it is an issue.</p>
<p>It defies all scholarly rationale to continue to ignore the fact that whether it be cultural, genetic, or just plain coincidence that those with European or certain East and South Asian ancestries are more intelligent and better adapted at building higher civilization.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t take the mind numbing litany any longer&hellip;   </p>

			<p>Hey; it appears the U.N. is starting to realize what race realists have known all along, although they draw a different conclusion. When you have large numbers of third world people living in a modern nation; the parts of the country they inhabit will closely resemble the third world, and if you don&rsquo;t do something about it, there could be serious conflict. The most logical conclusion would be to remove these people from our midsts, although I have a feeling the U.N. might favor a sligtly different approach. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Which kind of society and world do you want to live in?&#8221;</p>
<p>First off, I&rsquo;m not a global citizen.  Second, I want to live in a country where the government doesn&rsquo;t steal my hard earned money and give it to the least productive members of society.   Few &#8220;poor&#8221; people in this country live in real poverty.  They live in free or cheap housing, get free groceries, free medical and an amount of money from da gubmint depending on how many illegitimate babies they can squirt out.  I&rsquo;m a small business owner and I&rsquo;ve worked my b*tt off to get where I am in life.  You&rsquo;ve got a black candidate for President that wants to tax me to death so Shantiqah can get a little extra money in her next welfare check so she can go splurge it on something frivolous. I&rsquo;d be very surprised if he gets elected, but just in case he does, alot of employers might start paying their employees under the table. </p>

<p>Statistics mean nothing unless you have the reason behind them. No, it&rsquo;s not race it&rsquo;s lifestyle. Blacks and Hispanics drop out of school at higher rates, have kids out of wedlock at higher rates and are more likely to have single parent homes. They also have a greater number of kids than whites and are more likely to have a criminal record than whites since their crime rates our higher. THAT is why they have less money, it&rsquo;s lifestyle not race.</p>

<i>&ldquo;High levels of inequality can lead to negative social, economic and political consequences that have a destabilising effect on societies,&rdquo; said the report. &ldquo;[They] create social and political fractures that can develop into social unrest and insecurity.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The left always gets it backwards. It&rsquo;s negative social behavior that CAUSES these problems in the first place. If blacks and hispanics didn&rsquo;t behave according to their nature, things would be different for them.</p>
<p>Until or unless they can learn to act less ghetto, where they live and how they&rsquo;re perceived and received will be by ghetto standards.</p>
<p>The day blacks stop acting black is the day I won&rsquo;t see them as black.<br>

			<p>Notice how often the words &#8220;Internationally recognized&#8221; is used. This is a way to convince smart but gullible people that their is solid reasoning behind it. After all, if its international - lots of people sue it and therefore there much be a rational.</p>
<p>However, if there was a rational, it *could* just as well be used instead of &#8220;internationally recognized&#8221;. </p>

<p>Excellent! Lets repatriate and deport the inequal people so we, and they, can be happier with less &#8220;negative social consequences&#8221; for all&hellip;</p>

			<p>Let me see if I get this straight&hellip; inequality is bad and it is highly correlated with race.  If so, then the rational solution would be to stop forcing different races to inhabit the same lands.  Also, as has been pointed out, if we consistently see the same races at the bottom of the totem pole and the same ones at the top ALL AROUND THE WORLD - does this not imply that there is a genetic factor?  At least to the extent that serious research would be warranted?  Their answer is, of course, that such a notion cannot possibly be true - because it would offend their sensibilities and challenge their religious faith in racial egalitarianism.  To them I say, &#8220;wake up and smell the coffee!  Racial egalitarianism has no basis in science.  Grow up and take off your blinders.  Be willing to consider new ideas and stop being so narrow-minded.  Mother Nature has no regard for political correctness!&#8221;</p>

<p>Atlanta, New Orleans, Washington and Miami have populations similar to those of Nairobi, Kenya Abidjan and Ivory Coast. Therefore these social patterns and pathologies are entirely predictable. If blacks ever move en masse to the North Pole the NP will look quite a bit like Washington and Ivory Coast.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Any society which oppresses, neglects or harms it&rsquo;s weak members is an unjust and contemptable society.</p>
<p>Any society which uplifts, loves and heals it&rsquo;s weak members is a just and admirable society.</p>
<p>Which kind of society and world do you want to live in?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Those are noble sentiments any well-to-do country ought to entertain. We&rsquo;ve long ago reached the point in this country, however, where the benefits (entitlements) for being &#8216;weak&rsquo; (for some of us), are often as great as are the benefits offered for being strong (working) minus the actual work. Work that could be dangerous or debilitating.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t necessarily count on the other nations of the world to continue to prop up the leaky ship we have here for another 40 years. i.e. sending us endless consumer goods making our lives easier, while we send them nothing in return. </p>

<p>I would say this: Are you earnstly suggesting we simply hand whatever they want/or need to those who are too lazy or unwilling to WORK for what they want?</p>
<p>We, that is our society, does have a welfare infrastructure in place. Which is, needless to say, heavily abused by too many people, Whites as well as Blacks and other minority members.</p>
<p>Society owes a free public school education to EVERY American. Which we also have. But when Black minority members are not willing to APPLY themselves and get that education&hellip; those Blacks will never escape poverty or the attraction of crime. In short, THAT is the fault of those Blacks, emphaticall NOT the fault of our society.</p>
<p>We do have minimum wage laws&hellip; so the greedy corporate and business entities hire illegal immigrants to AVOID paying a fair wage to American workers. Then constantly circulating those propaganda lies: American&rsquo;s refuse to take certain jobs&hellip; We NEED MORE immigrants!</p>
<p>Congressmen and Senators, their pockets and campaign warchests lined with money from the business entities and corporations aid and abet the practice of bringing in illegal Hispanics, or quasi-legal H1b visa holders to force down prevailing wage levels. So at least respective to your point on &#8220;exploitation&#8221; I can at least agree with you in part.</p>
<p>But recalling the failure of communism/marxism, people have to be willing to work. Capitalism the vehicle to allow those with more drive and ambition to position themselves higher on the economic scale. So fundamentally, there is really not that much WRONG with a capitalist system. Hell, as to &#8220;bettering myself&#8221; with hard work and drive, I speak from personal experience. Having many times over the years, taken on a part-time job. Or taking on more work, more responsibility to earn raises, bonuses or promotion. So I do not feel we should do much for those too lazy or too unwilling to work. I firmly believe for a person to receive WELFARE checks, he or she should be required to do a minimal amount of work in the community. Even if only sweeping streets, cleaning up parks, scrubbing graffiti and the like. In short, deliberate idleness opposed to work should not be tolerated. Other than where inability to work has a valid, verifiable medical, mental basis.</p>
<p>Granted our welfare infrastructure could stand betterment. But hardly deserves your implied criticism.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Most working people&rsquo;s &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; is the result of living beneath one&rsquo;s means and investing for the long term. This is an anathema to the typical African-American who&rsquo;s general motto for life is &ldquo;Let the Good Times Roll!&rdquo; and if something happens, government will tax the stupid non-black producers in order to, as Barack Obama states: &#8216;Spread the Wealth!&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by at 9:33 PM on October 23</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Absolutely correct! Truer words were never spoken (or written).</p>
<p>(1) IF, the black race could ever carry its own water there would be no inequality. </p>
<p>(2) Notice that Senator Obama only wants to spread YOUR wealth, not his. Let him set the example by giving away the 99% of his wealth he doesn&rsquo;t need! Don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>
<p>(3) The opportunities in this country are u-l-i-m-i-t-e-d! I am about to enter into business with a young Chinese man, from a poorer part of China, who was never formally educated, who  taught himself English, who taught himself American business, and who will probably be a millionaire before he turns thirty. <br>
He also works sixteen hours a day, seven days a week!</p>
<p>By contrast, his black counterpart, born and reared in this country, with virtually unlimited governmental handouts, probably speaks Ebonics, listens to rap music, and sells drugs on the street.    </p>
<p>It is absolutely inconceivable to my young Chinese friend why ANYBODY in this country is poor. Inconceivable!  </p>
<p>Without any prompting from me he sums the black race up as follows: &#8220;lazy, stupid, and crooked!&#8221; He never saw a black in person until arriving legally in this country three years ago! </p>
<p>He was not impressed then, he is not impressed now!</p>

			<p><i>I wonder what all of those places have in common? Could it be White (Brahman in India) middle and upper class minorities amongst a huge population of non-Whites?</i></p>
<p>Of course the UN will compare Finland and the United States and conclude that the reason Finland is so &#8220;equal&#8221; is generous social spending, while the reason the USA is relatively unequal is the lack of said spending.  Pay no attention to the blindingly obvious demographic facts, please!</p>
<p>It seems that while having a homogenous population is no guarantee of an egalitarian society, it is basically impossible to have one in a nation where two racial groups co-exist.  </p>
<p>The very biggest mistake a country can make is to bring in workers of an alien racial group to do a certain kind of work   &mdash;   especially lower status work   &mdash;   as that country is creating a visually identifiable labor &#8220;caste&#8221; where none existed before, in the name of short term profits.  The American colonies did this during the slave trade, with disastrous long-term consequences, and America the nation is currently doing it again with the Mexican influx.  We sense this risk, I think, but the idea of an American exceptionalism and the existence of the &#8220;American dream&#8221; makes us think we are somehow exempt from these consequences, affirmed again and again throughout history and around the world.</p>

			<p><i>&lsquo;In western New York state nearly 40% of the black, Hispanic and mixed-race households earned less than $15,000 compared with 15% of white households.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>As someone who grew up in Western New York State, and who can remember it as it was, I can state here that until the 60s-70s, there was hardly any  &#8220;Black, Hispanic or mixed-race&#8221;  population  to be found in that part of the country.  And outside of Buffalo, it would have been even less   &mdash;   just about close to zero.   Therefore, all that exotic population has been added within the last 30 or so years. That is, the last third of a century.  Furthermore, virtually none of that population came from the educated element of society, but nearly all from the very bottom rungs.   </p>
<p>Does it not figure, then, that newcomers anywhere -  especially culturally backward, uneducated ones -  will not have the same incomes as an established, indigenous population which has been  settled there for generations?  Is it reasonable to expect that someone who arrived only recently is going to be as well off as those whose ancestors have lived there for many years and who actually built that society which others find so desirable to come to?  </p>
<p>So, if this unbalanced outcome is thought to be unfair  (despite all the affirmative action programs that have been in operation), then what does Ms. Tibaijuka  propose to do to rectify it?  Forcible re-distribution of wealth?</p>

			<p>Inequalities always come down to one crucial factor; IQ.  It&rsquo;s not racism, but it is racial reality.  The less intelligent races will always underperform when put next to the more intelligent races.  It is the same within race as well.  The smart will outperform / out-earn the dumb.</p>

<p>I would also like to have females on welfare required, regardless of race or ethnicity, to show proof of long-term contraception, possibly something like Norplant.  I see no reason that my tax money should go to pay for six kids by different fathers when there&rsquo;s an easy, effective way to prevent it.  This goes for LaKeeshia, Juanita, and just plain Jane.  </p>

<p>And thanks for the thoughtful response to my post!!!</p>
<p>And of course this is why the UN has to look at the &#8220;racism&#8221; of such places as the USA and Canada (of all places, give me a break,) because it explains away for them the utter wretchedness of the majority of their Third World client states.</p>
<p>And that is why: the USA, Canada, and every other Western country on the face of the earth, should withdraw both funding and membership from the UN; it is nothing but a tin pot collection of parasites and criminals.</p>
