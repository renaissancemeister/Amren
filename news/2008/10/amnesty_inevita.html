<h1>Amnesty Inevitable, Says Immigration Group</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chad Groening, OneNewsNow.com, October 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The head of an immigration reform organization argues grassroots America will have to mobilize if it hopes to prevent the next president and Congress from giving amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Numbers USA president Roy Beck explains he does not want people to feel a sense of desperation, but at the same time he does not want anyone to feel complacent when it comes to the reality of the upcoming election. Beck contends both John McCain and Barack Obama will not hesitate to push amnesty if either is elected on November 4.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to have to mobilize, as grassroots people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. against the establishment if we&rsquo;re going to save this country, because believe me, we are talking about saving the country,&#8221; he says.</p>

			<p>This is what I have believed all along. Doesn&rsquo;t matter who becomes president. They will justify amnesty by saying the 30 million new consumers, new credit card recipients, new mortgage recipients, and new car loan recipients will energize the slumping housing market and economy. This is so simple a friggen first grader could read what&rsquo;s going to happen. I wish I could pick horses like I can read these NWO freaks.</p>

			<p>Sure amnesty will come. A large segment of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck and all they care about is the next beer, hit of cocaine, pot,etc., or when football is on,etc. What I&rsquo;m saying, isn&rsquo;t off the top of my head. All of this is well known and you can&rsquo;t argue with the cold criteria of numbers and statistics. I believe that this country is doomed as a first world nation,because afterall, what determines the quality of a nation, if not the quality of its citizens? This even includes our politicians, business leaders, and presidential candidates. Look at both McCain and Obama. My Lord!! Their whole agenda for this nation is either non-existent, treasonous,or plain Stupid bordering on Sin. As one poster always writes, enough said and God help us all!!</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know about this   &mdash;   we have an amnestyaire President already, but Congress doesn&rsquo;t seem to be going for it.  The reason is that there are a bunch of moderate Democrats who would like to keep their jobs, and know that the amnesty position is the wrong one.</p>

			<p>Not so fast, sonny&hellip;..</p>
<p>George Bush was the biggest cheerleader for amnesty for illegal aliens. He had eight years of threats and begging and trickery to get a bill from congress he could sign, with the usual signing statements.</p>
<p>If George Bush cannot do this under any circumstance&hellip;.even with the big bipartisan support&hellip;..what makes you think these clowns will succeed where he failed?<br>

			<p>When friends and family have asked me to give them a specific example of how I think Obama will destroy America, this is the first thing I&rsquo;ve been telling them. The Obama/Reid/Pelosi Junta will definitely pass amnesty. If for no other reason, because it will give more Hispanics the right to vote, and we all know who they vote for. America&rsquo;s situation has looked pretty bleak for sometime, but at the moment there is still hope. It would be hard, but if the will was there, we could get rid of illegals and put this country back on track, although there&rsquo;s less then a 1% chance of that happening. I&rsquo;ve long maintained that the tipping point would be if we gave amnesty to these illegals. As I already stated, giving illegals a path to citizenship will give them the right to vote. Once that many Hispanics are able to take part in our election system, it&rsquo;s game over. There wont be a peaceful way to take our country back. They will have a large enough voting block to ensure that politicians who only care about their interests will get elected. Border enforcement will quickly end, and the countdown will begin. One good thing that could come out of this is that when you mix something as unpopular as amnesty with the first black president, an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, a march towards Socialism (i.e. wealth redistribution), the elimination or serious reduction of gun rights, censorship of conservative media, forced liberal indoctrination (i.e. banning of homeschooling &#8220;already happening in California&#8221;, and maybe even certain private schools), and an economic collapse, you get REVOLUTION!!! We&rsquo;re looking at what could be the perfect storm. Get ready, because I really believe that things are fixing to change drastically. </p>

			<p>The result will be permanent control of spanish speaking immigration networks over entire industries in the South and SouthWest, tens of millions of Americans relying on public assitance instead of having access to those jobs, a flow of money continuing to leave the country back to Mexico, sprialing social costs, underpaid taxes, etc&hellip; but most importantly it will destroy any possibility necessary reform will ever take place. EOM.</p>

			<p>George Bush was a far stronger proponent of amnesty than either of these two&hellip;.and we managed to convince him it was a bad idea.  We will do the same with McCain if he&rsquo;s elected.  Obama won&rsquo;t get elected (the polls are total lies, easily shown as such with real vote counts like what is coming out of california now).  But, God forbid, if he was elected, he would use immigration as a tool to destroy America.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference between the two on this issue.  McCain is well meaning&hellip;but stupid.  That can be fixed.  Obama is malevolent.  He can&rsquo;t be convinced&hellip;only stopped.</p>
<p>Most of the Congress, by the way, both democrat and republican, are coming around to our way of thinking on immigration.  Enough that reform is possible now.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The head of an immigration reform organization argues grassroots America will have to mobilize if it hopes to prevent the next president and Congress from giving amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both McCain and the messiah will deteriorate the entire picture even worse than it is now, so the country will continue to go downhill both economically, militarily, and socially.  </p>
<p>Our only chance at saving our white society is to congregate in various areas of the country, then push for secessation, and I&rsquo;m referring to secessation from the white radicals also.</p>
<p>Things have gotten to far out of hand to ever expect the entire country to return to an 85% white population, and if it did, a sizeable number of whites would be airhead radicals that are too far out in left field to see home plate, so they&rsquo;re lost.  I don&rsquo;t want to live in a mostly white country if there are any ding-a-ling whites included.</p>
<p>The best bet for people who believe as I do is to take over huge areas of the country, and secede even if the areas are not contiguous.  In fact there would definitely be a substantial military advantage to having various sectors secede.</p>

<p>Illegal immigration will stop, either by white Americans finally saying enough and fighting for what is theirs, or when this country becomes Mexico. It will stop when Americans finally stand up across the country and DEMAND and back that up with FORCE that Mexicans will no longer be allowed to come into our country and that illegals will go home. If this doesn&rsquo;t happen, then more and more Mexicans will flood this country until it turns into Mexico. Then the Mexicans will stop coming because the USA will be no different than Mexico. So which will it be, standing up and saving the USA or turning into Mexico. What America, is the answer to that question????</p>

			<p>Well, all I can say is if either of these two knuckleheads manages to get an amnesty pushed through you can say goodbye to the two-party political system ( I know there&rsquo;s not much difference now but it will be officially over). If McCain manages to win and gets amnesty through he will go down as the guy who ended the Republican party hopes of ever winning the White House again. If Obama wins and gets amnesty through he goes down in history as the man who ushered in one-party majority rule, something the Democrats are absolutely frothing at the mouth to happen. All this means is whatever Republicans are left in office they will sound even more like Democrats-to survive- to the point they might as well just call themselves &#8220;Democrats&#8221;. Either way, the talk of secession will get louder by people who will feel marginalized, unwanted and underrepresented in a one-party system that no longer fears any kind of political repercussions and is in a position to thwart any opposition. And watch how fast the loony leftwing &#8220;progressive&#8221; fringe of the Democrat party becomes the &#8220;mainstream&#8221;.</p>

			<p>He&rsquo;s right about amnesty being inevitable. He&rsquo;s wrong if he thinks that we have a chance of stopping it. The establishment won a long time ago. The globalists want to make sure that the world won&rsquo;t have the American standard of living to aspire to. They are going to continue the dilution of that standard until it disappears.  </p>
<p>In a few years, the U.S. will be a third world swamp and Chinese factory workers will have the new enviable standard of living to shine before the rest of the world. The American people still won&rsquo;t realize what happened to them, and they&rsquo;ll still be asking for bailouts with their own tax money. What has happened to America since the 1960&rsquo;s is incredible. What makes it so amazing is that this is really happening! </p>
<p>An the average American still watches television and believes that the cavalry will come riding over the hill. It&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>

			<p>The silence on this issues as a whole in the past six months at least, is deafening! That is a sure sign that both parties and their titular heads have agreed that it will be Amnesty for all, regardless of who wins this farce of an election. <br>
While many conservative whites are busying themselves with the Fox News tabloidisms of non-entity Bill Ayers, fear-mongering about Iran and hot-button fare like the ever-present &#8220;right to life&#8221; debates that go absolutely nowhere administration after administration.<br>
Amidst all this, virtually NO discussion of Amnesty, border security, etc. Ha anyone heard the annointed Sarah Palin speak to this issue? Is her stance aligned with McAmnesty? Who even knows? Has Palin even met a Mexican yet? </p>
<p>Lou Dobbs just had some discussion on the matter several days ago for the first time in I can&rsquo;t remember when! This is all forgotten in economic collapses, Obamania, etc. But the issue is only festering like an angry wound!</p>

			<p>Here is a more positive analysis. </p>
<p>If Obama wins, which is likely, he and the Democrats will be focused on the economy first.  The second major issue will be the war in Iraq.  I think Obama wants to give amnesty to the illegals, but given that it is an issue that can be used against them in the 2010 Congressional elections, they are likely to put it on the back burner.  </p>
<p>Remember, Obama needs white working class votes to become president and to win a second term.  The Democrats want to retain control of Congress.  So they are not, or not likely, going to make the same mistakes Bill Clinton made in the early part of his first term which resulted in the Republicans taking the House and Senate in 1994.</p>
<p>Although be aware that Obama as chief executive will be lax perhaps on border enforcement, raids, etc&hellip;The strategy of those of us that want border security and tighter immigration controls is to build a bridge to more conservative democrats.  Link the economy and jobs to illegal/legal immigration.   </p>
<p>The next two years are going to be critical.  We need to hold the line until the 2010 Congressional Elections and then go on the offensive for 2012.  In 2012 we need to get a real conservative in the White House.  So lets start planning now&hellip;</p>

			<p>If amnesty is passed, there will be 21 million new democratic voters overnight. They will form an unbeatable voting block for unending non-white immigration. The racial transformation will occur much more rapidly.The MSM will announce this day after day to White America.The post 1965 non-whites will vote for a massive increase in non-white immigration. Non-whites will be much more confrontational with non-whites at work and at school. Barack Obama will expand affirmative action to an even greater number of non-whites.</p>
<p>The good news is that our indifferent White neighbors and their children will- overnight- start to experience massive racial discrimination. This is not a social reality that they will be able to adapt to. </p>
<p>NUMBERSUSA is a despicable organization that has whited-out WHITE AMERICANS. Roy Beck goes out of his wat noy to mention the word WHITE AMERICAN. Beck makes the case against immigration completely in terms of the intetrest of non-whites. PREDICTION:when amnesty comes up a year from now,Roy Beck will appear on Lou Dobbs arguing that amnesty should be opposed because amnesty will harm the hindus,sikhs,mexicans,iranians,pakistani and korean legal immigrants in America.You don&rsquo;t beleive me? Well, he has done it several times already on the Lou Dobbs show. Peter Brimelow has recently taken notice of Beck&rsquo;s anti-white proclivities</p>

			<p>  Shamnasty will be the final nail in the coffin of our Republic. One AR poster listed the key years in our demise as 1865, 1954, 1965, and now add 2008. It will mean the population of the country will be majority minority probably as early as 2030. It won&rsquo;t be the United States of America anymore, but the United Races of America. We will be just another banana republic not too much different than our neighbors to the South: huge income disparities, urban crowding, environmental degradation, racial turmoil.  One thing will be different &mdash; we will be a grim Soviet style Brazil del Norte without any sense of good-natured fun. </p>

			<p>If amnesty passes, along with the upcoming depression (and it IS coming folks!) whites may finally take up arms and take our country back.  Not to be a doomsayer, but it&rsquo;s going to be rough.  You&rsquo;d better have a gun, and be prepared to use it.</p>

			<p>At least there are some alternatives to amnesty sell-outs in this election: for exmple the conservative Democrat Bob Conley of South Carolina is endorsed by anti-illegal immigration organizations against the sell-out Lindsey Graham. If a major pro-amnesty sell-out like Graham, after generating so much resentment, can be re-elected then there is no hope.</p>

Meanwhile, we  -  the  voiceless, unrepresented American People -  are crushed in between this odd alliance of capitalists and communists.   Of course, they are further aided in this by the churches, the media, and academia.  All are aligned against us.</p>
<p>Bush&rsquo;s rebuff was just a setback. Give them time to re-work their strategy. They won&rsquo;t stop trying.<br>

<p>Do you really think he believes now that amnesty is &#8220;a bad idea&#8221;?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we  &#8220;convinced&#8221;  him of any such thing!   Like a naughty child, he just got his wrist slapped, that&rsquo;s all,  but he remains unconvinced.   His term was about to end anyway. They&rsquo;ll be back for another try. <br>

			<p>Keep fighting against viiolations of immigration laws.  WE held the line through 8 years of determined resistance.  WE can turn immigration into the enforcement issue that it is.  Illegal immigrations are about failed Federal enforcement and extremely unaccountable immigration agencies. Like 9/11 was caused by illegal& legal immigrations, WE must never let the Washington sellouts forget what they allowed to happen on 9/11.  No one as yet has been held accounable.  It is past time to hold hearings and call for prosecutions about 9/11 and about the fiscal takeover/bailout.  The foundations of USA have been usurped from US and millions of lawyers out of work need to go to work for US! Otherwise, keep the guns loaded and be ready for anything. V</p>

			<p>&#8220;The next two years are going to be critical. We need to hold the line until the 2010 Congressional Elections and then go on the offensive for 2012. In 2012 we need to get a real conservative in the White House. So lets start planning now&hellip;</p>

<p>Some of you have already fell for the propaganda about the media&rsquo;s landslide victory for Obama.  When McCain gets in office, he might try to push for amnesty but if Bush couldn&rsquo;t get with a Democratic majority in Congress, what hope does he? </p>

			<p>Notice the absolute silence about the illegal immigration issue from MSM coverage, and in any of the discussions between the candidates - even though 70-80% of American citizens have demanded action for years. </p>
<p>Think of the Democrat (a name is always a noun, never an adjective [Democratic]) and Republican parties as two hand puppets held up by the same international corporate establishment - as the same old show for the public. They don&rsquo;t care which candidate the people elect, on economic issues they&rsquo;ll still get their way - which is all they care about. Mentally, spiritually, they&rsquo;ve already abandoned the nation they profit from.</p>
<p>From here on out the only people left representing Americans will have to be the ranks of Americans themselves.  </p>

			<p>I second Memphomaniac&rsquo;s (and others&rsquo;)posts that amnesty is not necessarily a done deal.</p>
<p>Obama will have his hands full with economy and war.  Amnesty for illegal aliens will require a HUGE expenditure of political capital.  How much goodwill does he really have in the bank?</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d much rather see Obama as president than McCain on this issue.  Hopefully, the &#8220;Stupid Party&#8221; will finally see how latinos stabbed them in the back despite Juan McAmnesty&rsquo;s lifelong career of pandering to them.  So maybe the few remaining Republicrats in Congress will oppose Obama&rsquo;s amnesty.  </p>
<p>If McAmnesty were to win next week (i.e, if pigs suddenly learn to pilot 757&rsquo;s) then amnesty is inevitable.</p>
<p>My hope (slim that it is) is that Republicratss finally understand that trying to outliberal the liberals is a losing game, that red-meat conservatives (like Palin) are still popular, and that latinos are congenital socialists who will NEVER, EVER, EVER be Republicans.  </p>
<p>If Republicrats figure this out, and if the economic collapse is as bad as I think it will be, 2010 will bring a return of conservatives to Congress.  Obama will be a Jimmy-Carter-One-Termer and 2012 will bring us the new Reagon (maybe Todd Palin?!)</p>
<p>Keep the faith!</p>

			<p>Yes, there will be efforts to grant amnesty to these illegals. I have been watching this situation for 20 years, and it only grows worse. I must concede that eventually serious civil strife will occur. However, if BHO is elected, as now seems likely, that, coupled with massive democratic gains in congress, is certain to ruin the economy. Maybe the senors from the south will slow down when there are no jobs to be had. Good heavens, just look at what 40 years of liberalism has done to this great country of ours.</p>

			<p> If they grant amnesty against the wishes of the American people, we owe them nothing. Not loyalty, not life,nor liberty, nor the pursuit of happiness.<br>
 If they give our country away and steal the futures of our children, there is nothing left to lose and no reason to leave them anything intact.<br>

			<p>Amnesty is a ruse.  Contrary to the irrational fears the electorate, they will not have the right to vote, at least, immediately.  The true threat, which the issue of amnesty will never touch because it is legally impervious, is the massive surge in births of immigrant children.</p>

			<p>Maximillian vonHerstberg, you are absolutely correct. When enough anchor babies come of age, the whole issue of AMNESTY WILL BE A MOOT POINT. They will take revenge and vote and win on any issue they please, including more amnesty. Close the borders, deportation through attrition, repeal anchor baby rule. The only way to save U.S. citizens from MEXICO.</p>

<p>You hit the nail on the head. I made basically the same exact  comments on Taki.com. John Zimrack used his influence at Taki.com to have me banned for making almost the exact same commnets. Most White Nationalist have been banned over at Taki.com. The cleansing at Taki.com will be complete in a few months.</p>

I strongly agree with Maximilan and Bobby. We must stress that tackling the issue of amnesty alone is not enough.  The topic of anchor babies MUST be part of the package, or any  proposed &#8220;solution&#8221; will be, in the long term, meaningless. The entire subject of birthright citizenship must be clarified (or if need be, changed) in order to remove any question about the citizenship status of children  who are merely born on US soil  (because their mothers happen to be temporarily here)  but having no other connections to the USA.</p>
<p>And ideally (though this may be dreaming), the illegitimate &#8220;citizenship&#8221; of those anchor babies already born here should be declared null or revoked.</p>

			<p>Jupiter, the banning of people with a white nationalist view is only going to backfire on those conservative sites sooner or later. As time goes on, as pointed out by Mr. Taylor in his lectures and writings, so called conservative whites will realize that non-whites are voting exclusively for issues in their own best interests. Where will this leave these faux conservatives? </p>
<p>Also, making the illegitimate &#8220;citizenship&#8221; of anchor babies null and void, as browser says, is going to be an impossiblity, when their are too many anchor babies come of age. None of this stuff is rocket science. Everyone can see it, but it is amazing how this nation refuses to face this obvious coming disaster.</p>
<p>P.S. Jupiter, I didn&rsquo;t realize the white discrimination you allege exists over at numbers U.S.A. It doesn&rsquo;t totally surprise me however, because if I would be excused for saying this the thousandth time, we have so many traitors to the original culture of this nation as to be unbelievable.</p>
