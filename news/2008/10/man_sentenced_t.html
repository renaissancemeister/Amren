				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henri E. Cauvin, Washington Post, October 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Nigerian-born businessman convicted of smuggling a 14-year-old girl into the United States and forcing her to work as an unpaid servant at his home in Germantown was sentenced yesterday to more than eight years in prison.</p>
<p>George Udeozor, who was extradited from Nigeria in February after almost four years as a fugitive, pleaded guilty in July to holding the victim in involuntary servitude. He admitted having sex with the girl, abuse that prosecutors said began when she was 15.</p>
<p>But yesterday, with his family and friends present at U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Udeozor all but accused the victim of lying, even as he admitted mistakes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The prosecution of the Udeozors renewed attention to the smuggling of girls and women to work as live-in domestic help in the United States, where they are often unpaid or otherwise mistreated. Law enforcement officials estimate that thousands are recruited every year from impoverished countries to do domestic work.</p>
<p>Washington and New York are major centers for the practice, in part because both are home to diplomatic missions, whose officials can bring in domestic servants on special visas, and to large immigrant populations.</p>
<p>The victim was not in court yesterday, but she testified during the 2004 trial of Udeozor&rsquo;s former wife, Adaobi Stella Udeozor. Then 23, she testified that she looked after six children but was never paid and was not enrolled in school. She said Adaobi Udeozor beat her. Adaobi Udeozor was sentenced to more than seven years in prison.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Federal officials said the case demonstrates that such abuses will be prosecuted aggressively. &#8220;Forcing a helpless and innocent girl into a life of servitude while inflicting physical violence is simply intolerable,&#8221; James A. Dinkins, special agent in charge of the Baltimore office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a statement. &#8220;ICE is committed to protecting those who cannot protect themselves.&#8221;<br/>

<p>How is this any different than drafting innocent teenage American girls into forced servitude to Washington traitors while facing death in battle as Obama proposes?  </p>
<p>The first people to fall in the next foreign war replete with the draft will be the members of the local draft boards&hellip; </p>

			<p>It is insane to punish black people for acting black. Slavery is a common part of black culutre, from Haiti ot the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>They are slavers and sex abusers at heart.  </p>
<p>We managed to half civilize/half Christianize a few of the slaves who moved here to America, but it is clear that they feel a constant pull to return to their polygamous and slaver roots.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to change them   &mdash;   trying to make them &#8220;act white&#8221;   &mdash;   we ought to let them return to their native practices &hellip; and keep the rest of them from immigrating to the USA.</p>

			<p>The &#8216;abuse&rsquo; began when she was 15. Something tells me if this had been an underage lesbian affair, or a gay one, the media wouldn&rsquo;t be so quick to sum the whole thing up as &#8216;abuse&rsquo;. Heterosexuals unite! <br/>

			<p>There are more slaves in the US today than there were back before it was made illegal.</p>
<p>Almost nobody notices.</p>

			<p>So where was the abject apology for slavery?  Or did Bill Clinton take all those sins onto himself?  Viva multiculturalism.</p>

			<p>&#8220;So where was the abject apology for slavery? Or did Bill Clinton take all those sins onto himself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clinton did grovel and apologize on behalf of the white race on at least a couple of occasions, didn&rsquo;t he? Too bad I hadn&rsquo;t discovered AmRen at that time. I&rsquo;m sure there were some interesting comments about it. If I was old enough, I&rsquo;d probably be able to remember 4 or 5 other Democratic presidents doing the same thing. Haven&rsquo;t I seen some old footage of LBJ prostrate in some act of apology? </p>

			<p>The last known slave in America was Merzouk, personal slave of Feisal of Saudi Arabia, who brought him along on his visit in 1944.<br/>
With friends like these, who needs enemies.</p>

			<p>How long is it since slavery was abolished in UK/USA? Black africans (African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans) who still moan and groan about the lasting effects of slavery on their failing culture in White countries should read (that&rsquo;s a laugh) a rather compelling two page report from the depths of africa, cradle of all civilisation. It will explain a lot about the above story.<br/>

			<p>Where is the &#8220;American&#8221; feminist movement on this?  No doubt, they will use this case to make sure every black female can emigrate to the US to avoid African cultural &#8220;abuses.&#8221; Of course, these women are the ones who cut off each others&rsquo; sex organs!  So they are a big part of the many immigration related &#8220;cultural&#8221; practices that we have never before faced before disgusting changes were made to our immigration laws. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m suprised he didn&rsquo;t try to claim that he &#8220;didn&rsquo;t understand&#8221; slavery had been abolished almost 150 years ago here.  Isn&rsquo;t &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t understand it was illegal&#8221; the usual fallback position of Fourth-World miscreants when caught here, such as when a Mexican illegal alien is caught after having impregnated an 11 year-old?</p>
<p>What exactly does a Nigerian &#8220;businessman&#8221; do in the United States, anyway?  Surely he could run &#8220;419&#8221; scams from back home.</p>

			<p>This is another clear case of Provençal, myopic Caucasians trying to impose their own culturally dysfunctional morally relativistic values upon a superior culture. A culture having never been encumbered with our antiquated Puritanical views which we whites use to continuously, condescendingly castigate with impunity, those countries of color which possess far more advanced, far more multi cultural views on basic, fundamental human relationships than we whites could ever be capable of understanding. Who are we to judge them? </p>
<p>Of course had a white man done the same thing he would have been summarily executed!</p>
<p>I should have picked my own damn cotton!</p>
