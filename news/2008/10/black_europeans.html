<h1>Black Europeans Pin Political Hopes on Obama</h1>
									<div align="left">

					</div>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Many black Europeans say victory for Barack Obama in the U.S. election might set an example that could help remedy their under-representation in European politics.</p>
<p>But they emphasize that the U.S. Democrat inspires a massive following in Europe through his ideas and charisma, not just because of his color.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the first black to achieve what he is achieving but that would not be sufficient to follow him,&#8221; said Patrick Lozes, head of France&rsquo;s Representative Council of Black Associations. &#8220;Nobody would have supported him just because he is black.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Obama wins because of his performance, not because he&rsquo;s black,&#8221; agreed Innocent Ekhorutumwek, a 26-year-old Nigerian street vendor in Rome.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not only Democrat sympathizers but conservatives too have welcomed the boost Obama has given to black people, underlining the historic symbolism of a black man contesting the leadership of the world&rsquo;s most powerful nation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;His father is African and this link is special to me,&#8221; said Oumar Diallo, a sociologist of Guinean ancestry in Berlin.</p>
<p>&#8220;WOEFULLY BAD&#8221;</p>
<p>But an Obama win would highlight how far Europe lags behind America in the representation of black people. Only a handful of people of African origin sit on Europe&rsquo;s national assemblies.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>You need to keep in mind that there are almost 5 million black people among France&rsquo;s 63 million inhabitants,&#8221; [Lozes] said. Most of France&rsquo;s non-white population is from Arab north Africa or sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lozes said Obama in the White House would encourage European leaders to take &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; about black people&rsquo;s access to the top echelons of public life, and would boost black people&rsquo;s views of their own possibilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minorities will see it is possible, self-inhibition will decrease and people who were not trying anything because of discrimination will feel they can succeed,&#8221; Lozes told Reuters.</p>

			<p>Someone call and make them an offer&hellip;.if they like Obama so much, we will send him to you for free&hellip;win or lose in November.</p>
<p>Maybe they will let Obama be president of the European Union.</p>
<p>I would be in favor.</p>

<p>Hmm, that&rsquo;s funny. Then why do I count 11 uses of the word &#8220;black&#8221; just in this short excerpt alone, including the Representative Council of Black Associations? Also the article never mentions just how few white representatives there are throughout most of Africa.  </p>
<p>Africans have nearly a whole continent of their own, with very little &#8220;tolerance&#8221; for those of other races, yet if they don&rsquo;t have what they consider to be adequate representation in all European nations, it&rsquo;s apparently scandalous.</p>

			<p>They have it exactly opposite.  Anti-immigrant, anti-black sentiment and nationalism are rising in europe.  As has happened in the past, the US will be strongly influenced by that.  Once europe converts to nationalism, many in the American left will convert also&hellip;.especially if Obama loses the election.  Or maybe especially if Obama wins the election and Americans get a taste of Mugabe style politics.</p>
<p>This seems unlikely to any who have grown up in the age of communists and racist minorities controlling the white American Left.  But, what they don&rsquo;t know is that it wasn&rsquo;t always so.  The American Left is not attached to those causes.  Beneath the surface, what motivates them and has ALWAYS motivated them are a desire to engage in fascist-like behavior.  The causes change but the violence, militance and desire for totalitarianism, stays the same.  As europe shifts, so will the US.<br>

			<p>There is much to despise in this piece of used toilet paper that passes for an &#8220;article,&#8221; but the worst of all, is this tidbit of stray excrement:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only Democrat sympathizers but conservatives too have welcomed the boost Obama has given to black people, underlining the historic symbolism of a black man contesting the leadership of the world&rsquo;s most powerful nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Give me a beer and a break! </p>
<p>If the &#8220;historic symbolism&#8221; of a callow and inexperienced sophist senator potentially setting the USA on a course of at best economic depression and at worst utter destruction, &#8220;contesting the leadership of the world&rsquo;s most powerful nation,&#8221; is what is so &#8220;inspiring&#8221; that it can &#8220;boost&#8221; black &#8220;people&#8221; out of their natural state of un-evolved wretchedness, has not multiculturalism reached its zenith? What more could it, as the most evil mutation of a discredited socioeconomic theory, do to prove its malignancy, other than this? </p>
<p>The destruction ( more accurately the implosion) of the former Soviet Union, will be nothing to what is coming to the United States, should this &#8220;savior&#8221; and &#8220;saint&#8221; get his buttocks planted behind the desk in the oval office. It will only have precedence, with what happened to Greece or Rome; the full obliteration of the world&rsquo;s most: civilized, free, and productive society to date. </p>
<p>And all in the name of, &#8220;historic symbolism?&#8221;</p>
<p>To paraphrase my favorite observations by Machiavelli: It is better to be feared as the most brutal pimp in the whorehouse, then to be &#8220;loved&#8221; as the most willing of whores in that same brothel.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>First let&rsquo;s get one thing straight- - there&rsquo;s no such thing as a &#8220;black European.&#8221; They fled their black run countries because they became unlivable and now they complain that there aren&rsquo;t enough blacks running things in Europe. The stupidity of these people is mind numbing. They can&rsquo;t grasp that Europe is NOT theirs to rule. How many Whites are elected to office by blacks in Africa, or Detroit for that matter? As they whine about the lack of blacks in charge in Europe, Whites are being systematically kicked out of Africa. But to bring THAT up would be considered &#8220;racissss&#8221; I suppose. I just shake my head in disbelief when I read about a &#8220;26 yr. old Nigerian street vendor in Rome&#8221; or a &#8220;sociologist of Guinean ancestry in Berlin.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Many black Europeans say victory for Barack Obama in the U.S. election might set an example that could help remedy their under-representation in European politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>One more time for all the blacks, only this time&hellip;real&hellip;.slow.</p>
<p>If you are black, your race helps you get positions in order to create &#8220;diversity,&#8221; because the multicult fools will push you into positions you couldn&rsquo;t qualify for on your own ability, knowing full well you&rsquo;re not qualified.  </p>
<p>So being a black is an advantage for you. </p>
<p>The reason there are not more blacks in positions that require an adeptness at self-expression and a good education is because low black I.Q. prevents blacks from understanding studies necessary to learn certain required information and theories, plus many other reasons.</p>
<p>The average black has an I.Q. of 85, which is too low for anything but menial labor, so it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if there were an Obama type in charge of every country, because that wouldn&rsquo;t magically turn low I.Q. into rocket scientists, even though I&rsquo;m certain you truly believe that&rsquo;s a lie, because you own a grey suit and a pair of horned rimmed glasses, which would qualify you as a barrister, a psychiatrist, or a top notch CPA.</p>
<p>So it looks like you&rsquo;ll just have to continue putting up with white oppression and racism, designed by honkies to keep the black man down.</p>
<p>Or return to Africa.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Black&#8221; Europeans? It&rsquo;s an oxymoron.  Europeans are white. Africans are black.  Your identity shouldn&rsquo;t be based on which piece of dirt you were born on, but on the content of your genes.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not voting for Obama because of his skin color, I&rsquo;m not voting for him because of his politics.  I don&rsquo;t want any more Liberals on the Supreme Court.  And that &#8220;my friends,&#8221; is the ONLY reason.</p>
<p>There is a silver lining to an Obama win&hellip; has anyone else noticed how less hostile most blacks seem to be lately?  I wonder what&rsquo;s up with them?  Hmmmmmmm.<br>

  Sir, I doubt that many on this site share your enthusiasm for Senator Obama. While we can&rsquo;t energetically support an open borders, establishment Neo-con Candidate like John McCain, most would agree that an Obama presidency will be unmitigated disaster for the country. It&rsquo;s possible that Mr. Obama may move to the center to govern our troubled country, but this appears unlikely given his pass associations and the prospects of a Democratic Congress. I believe President Obama will ultimately occupy a place in our history similar to Philip the Arab in Rome&rsquo;s long sunset of decline.</p>

<p>Blacks have never been known for abstract thinking or subtle intellectual concepts. But they are fully capable of recognizing who looks like them.</p>

			<p>I have been to western Europe many times, and I have found it shocking how naive White europeans view Black people  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s almost a condescending affection and admiration bordering on uncritical worship.  They think every Black man is a potential Sidney Poitier, who, as we know, Hollywood change-agents used as a Trojan Horse, to get Blacks into our homes and into our daughters&rsquo; beds.  </p>
<p>The Marxist indoctrination in their schools and on television has completely blinded them to any sense of reality.  They see most Americans as racists  &mdash;  without any understanding of what &#8216;race realism&rsquo; is.  Obama is just yet another in a long line of media-created noble Black men who perpetuates this Marxist fantasy.  No wonder he&rsquo;s so popular over there&hellip;.</p>

			<p>While the governments in Africa daily become blacker, Europe is supposed to darken theirs?  Sometimes I wish I wasn&rsquo;t of northern, central, and western European descent, because I think that 95% of us want us to die off.  That goes for the idiots who think that the Republican party is a good thing&hellip; I was just thinking, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Reagen&rsquo;s amnesty in 1986 or the Bush administration&rsquo;s policy of &#8220;invade the world/invite the world&#8221; Obama Hussein wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance.  No wonder some people refer to the Republican party as the &#8220;stupid&#8221; party.  We need to rethink everything in regards to our collective governments.  I am for a 3rd way.</p>

			<p>Here is what the wonderful community organizer, civil rights attorney and school slush fund administrator Barak Obama and his communist friends have accomplished in the last 25 years.</p>
<p><br>
Perhaps the U.S. should pull out of Chicago ? <br>
Body count: <br>
In the last six months: <br>
292 killed (murdered) in Chicago ; <br>
221 killed in Iraq . <br>
Chicago&hellip;. Who Runs it: <br>
Senators: Barack Obama &amp; Dick Durbin <br>
Rep: Jesse Jackson Jr., <br>
Illinois Gov: Rod Blogojevich, <br>
Illinois House leader Mike Madigan, <br>
Illinois Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan (daughter of Mike), <br>
Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley (son of Mayor Richard J. Daley) <br>
&hellip;..our leadership in Illinois &hellip;..all Democrats. <br>
Thank you for the combat zone in Chicago . <br>
Of course, they&rsquo;re all blaming each other! </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t blame Republicans; there aren&rsquo;t any! <br>
State pension fund $44 Billion in debt, worst in country. <br>
Cook County ( Chicago ) sales tax 10.25% highest in country. (Look &#8216;em up if you want). <br>
Chicago school system rated one of the worst in the country. <br>
This is the political culture that Obama comes from in Illinois . And he&rsquo;s gonna &#8216;fix&rsquo; Washington politics for us? </p>
<p>Jennifer Hudson&rsquo;s Mother and brother were just shot in Obama&rsquo;s old district.  Chief suspect is a criminal out on parole who was living at that address.</p>
<p>Just what we need, Obama as President, Ayers, Dohrn, Klonsky, Acelrod and the rest of the crew running the country.</p>

			<p>Europeans in general are still quite naive indeed about blacks, although the British at least have wised up somewhat (at terrible cost to their island). Most continental Europeans only know blacks from American TV shows and Hollywood where blacks are portrayed in a far more positive light then any realistic measure would warrant. From 1960&rsquo;s movies like TO SIR WITH LOVE to today&rsquo;s CSI shows where you see some &#8220;brilliant&#8221; black criminologist-scientist solving the crime of some (wouldn&rsquo;t you just know it?) dastardly White criminal. The Europeans are being sold a fairy tale. </p>

<p>Nothing at all.  Nothing automatically, that is.   And neither does the Right.  </p>
<p>There are individuals from those groups  above who can be found on both the Right and the Left.  Yes, probably most are over on the Left simply because the Left has cultivated them for many years while the Right has consistently snubbed them. Should it be any surprise then?</p>
<p>It strikes me as an interesting characteristic that the Left strives to make as many friends and allies as possible (wise strategy, I would think), wherever it can find them, while the Right (foolishly) specializes in excluding, alienating, and rejecting as many potential friends and supporters as possible.  The Right seems much less interested in finding allies than in specifying those it DOESN&rsquo;T want.  [We don&rsquo;t want you, you, or you!]  Small wonder that it is so limited and unsuccessful. And they wonder why!</p>
<p>Those groups you mention above have been  <i>used </i> by the  Left as convenient allies, but there is no such thing as a permanent alliance.  As conditions change, alliances will shift and change too. Just look at the recent Jewish misgivings about the traditional black-Jewish alliance.  It served its purpose   &mdash;   once.  But to some, it doesn&rsquo;t look so attractive anymore. In fact, the love affair has waned on both sides.</p>
<p>In your comment I detect a certain right-wing religious slant, since you have gone after exclusively those pet issues that the Fundies are obsessed with (anything connected with religion or reproduction).   But a  <i>religious </i> fundamentalist is not necessarily of either the <i>political  </i>right or the left .  Just check out  their position on  race, inter-marriage, segregation, immigration, eugenics&hellip;.    Very few today will take an independent position on these matters.  In fact, most are slavish conformists to government orthodoxy and are far to the left on racial matters.</p>
<p>As a right-wing non-believer myself (both in religion and in government orthodoxy), I find it curious, by the way, that you have zeroed in on certain groups while you have conveniently omitted mentioning others.  The religions,  to cite just one example.   It is not atheists who are settling  Somalis and Sudanese  in Minnesota.  (You might check with the Lutherans though.)   It is not hippies who are enthusiastic about importing Mexicans into Utah.  (But some church groups are.)  It is not homosexuals who are  establishing sanctuary churches and preaching sermons for illegal aliens.  Oh, I could go on about others, but it wouldn&rsquo;t get printed.</p>

<p>  Yes, I realize that he was white (I&rsquo;ve seen his marble bust ) but not of native Roman stock. The period of decline is more analogous, if not the race. Philip came near the end of the Western Roman Empire before the disastrous battle of Abrittus where the Goths defeated the cream of the legions and killed the Roman Emperor, Decius. The Western Roman Empire was more less finished after that. </p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been many, many years since I&rsquo;ve been in Europe, but now with the internet I&rsquo;m able to read El Pais, a newspaper published in Nadrid, and I read it almost every day. El Pais is no different than what we get in our MSM. It might as well be the New York Times or the Raleigh News and Observer. </p>
<p>The Spaniards have been totally brainwashed. What&rsquo;s really upsetting are the comments on articles about Obama. People are absolutely gleeful about an Obama presidency and how that will teach the nasty White gringos a lesson. (Yes, the Spaniards are now using the word &#8220;gringo&#8221; to describe us.)I can&rsquo;t believe how far we Europeans in just 40 years. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to feel glad that I&rsquo;m an old lady so I won&rsquo;t be around to see the end times of Western civilation. It&rsquo;s all very sad. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The Spaniards have been totally brainwashed. What&rsquo;s really upsetting are the comments on articles about Obama. People are absolutely gleeful about an Obama presidency and how that will teach the nasty White gringos a lesson. (Yes, the Spaniards are now using the word &ldquo;gringo&rdquo; to describe us.) I can&rsquo;t believe how far we Europeans [fell] in just 40 years.&#8221; <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
The Spanish today are so brainwashed that they are ashamed of their own Christopher Columbus.  Even in his hometown of Barcelona he has become a non-person.</p>

			<p>The European Union&rsquo;s total and unflinching support for Obama is simply geopolitics; another way of socking it to the United States in a &#8220;poke me in the eye? I will poke YOU in the eye!&#8221; game of tit-for-tat. Several of the major nations in the European Union, led by France and Germany,loudly refused to support the US led invsaion of Iraq, and condemned the US roundly on the international scene. The Bush administration then proclaimed (equally loudly) it&rsquo;s support for Turkish full membership to the EU, which Europeans noted with alarm, would flood Europe with 90 million muslim Turks. Now the Europeans are pushing for Obama with all their might, knowing his election will distract and weaken the influence and effectiveness of US power projection overseas. Anyway, thats one theory.</p>

Sorry, but I can&rsquo;t agree with your theory, Alex.   Firstly, Europeans don&rsquo;t hate us, although some may be resentful of recent US highhandedness   &mdash;   for which I can&rsquo;t blame them. (Why should they get involved in Bush&rsquo;s lies and concocted wars?)  But mainly, Europeans think Obama is wonderful for the very same reasons that  small-town Minnesotans and  South Dakotans think he&rsquo;s wonderful.  And also because they have been told so, unanimously,  by their  enthusiastic media which can&rsquo;t sing his praises enough.  </p>
<p>I have seen little kids, about 7 or 8, getting all excited at the mere sight of Obama&rsquo;s face on the TV, and chanting &#8220;Obama, Obama!&#8221;   These young kids don&rsquo;t know  <i>anything </i> about world politics, and they certainly don&rsquo;t have anything against the USA.   They might think he&rsquo;s a movie star or sports hero, for all they know, since that&rsquo;s the way he&rsquo;s presented. He&rsquo;s just considered somebody wonderful. </p>
<p>And somebody with a uniquely distinctive face that stands out from other, more typical, more accustomed, politicians.  He&rsquo;s like Tiger Woods, whose face seems to be everywhere on advertisements.  Just WHAT does Tiger Woods DO, exactly, that makes him so wonderful???</p>
<p>Above all, Europeans don&rsquo;t think that Obama will weaken the US because that would presuppose that they consider blacks  incompetent and guaranteed to mess up everything they touch. And that simply isn&rsquo;t the case. They don&rsquo;t have such a notion.  We may know better about that, don&rsquo;t we?  But most Europeans still don&rsquo;t.  To most them, outside the big cities, blacks are still something of an interesting novelty&hellip;. a brave, noble people who have &#8220;suffered&#8221; terribly and who are therefore entitled to be given every extra chance in life.</p>

			<p>What good thing about Obama coming onto the scene is that he is likely to replace MLK and Co. It was becoming downright embarrassing for blacks to talk about MLK or Rosa Parks and get any sense of pride over their history.  One was a street agitator and the other one didn&rsquo;t want to get out of her seat on a bus.  Kind of pales in comparison to Neil Armstrong and the moon landing, huh?  I don&rsquo;t think Obama will win this election but the blacks can talk about him for the next 40 years as a &#8220;once run&#8221;.   </p>

<p>Quite true, it seems the more removed from diversity whites are the stronger they embrace it. Those of us who have lived in &#8220;rich&#8221; multicultural environments have an entirely different view. <br>
