<h1>SA Men the World&rsquo;s Most Violent</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=856397</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The &#8220;macho man&#8221; attitude of South African men is one of the main reasons they have been ranked among the most violent in the world.</p>
<p>The rate of violence among young men in the country is nine times higher than the global average.</p>
<p>The global homicide death rate among men is 13.6 per 100000, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Report on Violence and Health. In South Africa, it is 87 men per 100000, according to the National Injury Mortality Surveillance System.</p>
<p>South Africa ranks with Latin American countries such as Brazil (42.5 per 100000) and Colombia (122.4 per 100000) which have the highest homicide averages in the world.</p>
<p>This alarming trend is being explored by experts from the South African Medical Research Council (MRC) with government departments and universities in the hope of finding a solution.</p>
<p>An MRC study undertaken to examine the problem, which focused on young and middle-aged men, reviewed the scientific literature about male violence.</p>
<p>Some of the findings pulled from a variety of reports include:</p>
<p># South African murders claim the lives of nine male victims to every female victim (National Injury Mortality Surveillance System, 2005 data);</p>
<p># The rate at which men are murdered in South Africa is 6.4 times higher than in the rest of the world (WHO Report on Violence and Health); and</p>
<p># Young South African men commit acts of violence at a rate nine times higher than the world average (WHO Bulletin).</p>
<p>The &#8220;macho man&#8221; attitude of South African men has been identified as one of the reasons they commit violent, often senseless, crimes.</p>
<p>Professor Kopano Ratele, acting director of the MRC&rsquo;s Crime, Violence and Injury programme, said: &#8220;Our men can&rsquo;t walk away from a challenge. Parents need to teach their children it is okay to walk away from conflict, instead of fighting with their fists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only this week, a customer went on the rampage at a pharmacy in Somerset West in a fit of rage over a queue to pay. Dis-Chem director Kevin Sterling said a man, later identified as carpet shop owner Mustafa Akar &#8220;started letting rip with his mouth&#8221; and allegedly hit a staff member over the head with a 5kg bucket of supplements.</p>
<p>Somerset West police said Akar appeared in court on Tuesday and was charged with common assault and malicious damage to property.</p>
<p>In another case of male violence, a 16-year-old Oudtshoorn schoolboy has been charged with murder after he stabbed his uncle, 23, in the head last Saturday. The teen allegedly lost his temper because his uncle had eaten all the bread.</p>
<p>Ratele said researchers needed to focus on what society could do to reduce the chances of men becoming victims and perpetrators of violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can do this by building strong institutions &mdash; good schools where young men can make positive connections as well as good family structures,&#8221; Ratele said.</p>
<p>Alcohol abuse, lack of family structure, low levels of education, violence in the family, lack of community involvement and support, and cultural values are some of the reasons experts have identified as causes of male violence.</p>
<p>Factors protecting against male violence include &#8220;an education, maturity, vocational skills, religious and spiritual beliefs, positive family role models, presence of a father, close peer relations, a sense of community, recreation opportunities, affordable housing, welfare and economic opportunities &#8220;.</p>
<p>South African men who were exposed to parental violence or suffered physical abuse as children were at the greatest risk (27.5%) of becoming abusers of intimate partners themselves (Canadian Medical Association Journal).</p>
<p>Organisations such as the National Institute for Crime Prevention and the Reintegration of Offenders help men to reform, often with good results. While serving a 10-year sentence for armed robbery and assault, Deon Venter discovered a talent for art and won the best overall prize at the bi-annual Nicro art awards.</p>
<p>Since his release, Venter, who paints under the name Villain, has been living with a new wife in the quiet hamlet of Hondeklipbaai on the West Coast. He said he led a contented life, surviving on the money he made from selling paintings of flower landscapes, donkey carts and seascapes.<br>

			<p>I think the reason ZA&rsquo;s rate here is highest is because it&rsquo;s the blackest country in the world that keeps reliable statistics.  If the rest of Africa was able to keep reliable statistics, then ZA wouldn&rsquo;t look so bad.  Also a problem in Africa is that the lines between formal warfare and everyday violence are sorta blurred.</p>

			<p>Is it white or black men that are more violent? Where are theracial breakdowns? Since there are none, I must conclude that it is SA black men that are violent. Am I the only one who wishes the news would report the facts- for a change.</p>

			<p>If we were to give the men  1.more &#8220;opportunity&#8221; 2.better childhoods 3.more teaching about why homocide is wrong 4.more<br>
anger management 5.less inequality between races we could solve<br>
this problem. The problem is not in these men who murder but in society as a whole and only through reeducation of all society through a coersive government problem will we be able to solve the problem.</p>

<p>The above poster who pointed out that the only reason that SA is the highest, is the other African countries lack statistics is undoubtedly correct. Perhaps the Brazilian government could hire statisticians to survey the rest of Africa and they could knock themselves out of the top 10 quite easily. The boost in tourism dollars would pay their salaries easily.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The &ldquo;macho man&rdquo; attitude of South African men is one of the main reasons they have been ranked among the most violent in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not true.  It might be a small reason, but certainly it has nothing to do with committing crimes.</p>
<p>Blacks are the most violent race of people anywhere on the earth not just S.A.  It is in the genes of these people.  A propensity for crime and violence and a lack of impulse control are two weaknesses blacks have regardless of whether they&rsquo;re in South Africa or Detroit.  </p>
<p>If South Africa has higher incidents of crime and violence, it is because the country is degenerating and the ability to control them has diminished severely with black rule.</p>
<p>Did not these same blacks criminals have macho attitudes during apoartheid?  They did, of course.  But they knew if they stepped out of line an efficient white society would come down hard on them.</p>
<p>Being macho doesn&rsquo;t have much to do with the problem.  If a single cause must be cited for crime, how about assigning stupidity to it?  That would be closer to the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our men can&rsquo;t walk away from a challenge. Parents need to teach their children it is okay to walk away from conflict, instead of fighting with their fists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What do fists have to do with raping babies, making the nation the rape capitol of the world?  What does killing and robbing helpless victims have to do with facing a challenge?  I think the old bro who said that might want to create the impression that these black thugs are romantic, two fisted rogues, instead of cowardly blacks who get in few fights unless they outnumber their victim about 5 to 1, just as they do in the US.</p>

<p>Among African Americans, African Austrailians, African Europeans, and African Africans  &mdash;  are we seeing a common thread here?<br>
*******<br>
Factors protecting against male violence include &#8220;an education, maturity, vocational skills, religious and spiritual beliefs, positive family role models, presence of a father, close peer relations, a sense of community, recreation opportunities, affordable housing, welfare and economic opportunities&#8221;.</p>
<p>In other words acting like civilized inhabitants of a first World country; but that would require white people admitting their racism caused the problem, and paying increasing tolls over the next 50 years to try and rectify the problem.<br>
(Because dontchaknow, it&rsquo;s ALWAYS Whitey&rsquo;s fault?)<br>

			<p>This is the fault of whites.  By attempting to give them the benefits of the modern world, what we actually did was remove a significant amount of survival pressure from their daily lives.  Effort that would normally be directed toward basic survival is not directed toward violence.</p>
<p>They are NOT like us.  For them, wealth is a source of great evil.</p>

			<p>I would  look  for  explanations  of  the  high murder  rate in South  Africa in  factors other  than  race. These  data  support my position:</p>
<p>Namibia, Zimbabwe and  Zambia  are  neighbours  of  South Africa yet  their  average  per 100,000  murder  rate  is  8. This  is  some  10 times  less than  that  of  South Africa. Russia&rsquo;s  rate  is  16 and  that  of  Mexico  25. </p>
<p>Obviously, if  race  were  the  main causative  factor  then  the  murder  rates of  South  Africa&rsquo;s  neighbours  would  approximate  that  of  South  Africa. </p>
<p>And  if  race  and  murder  statistics  were  causally connected  then  how  do  we  explain  the  fact  that  most  nations  in Africa  have  murder  rates  much  less  than  those  of  Russia and  Mexico.  Note  too  that  the  murder rate in Ivory Coast  is  less than  those of  Ukraine, Estonia and  Moldova. And  Bermuda  &mdash;  a  predominantly  black  country  &mdash;  has a  murder  rate  less  than  those of Scotland, France  and  Ireland.</p>
<p>Obviously, sociology rather  than  genetics explains national murder  rates  world-wide.  </p>
<p>Thus  I  am  inclined  to  believe  that  it  is  the  extreme  brutalising impact  of  Apartheid  that  has  created  the unnatural sociology  of  the  indigeneous  South African.</p>

			<p>A previous poster (Ranger) was spot on in saying a lack of impulse control as well as a propensity for crime and violence are reasons why Bantus have high crime rates no matter where they are. I would add that poverty has nothing to do with it as well.</p>
<p>How else can you explain the criminality that some Bantu basketball, football, boxing and musicians have displayed? It can&rsquo;t be poverty. What other race takes an almost gleeful &#8220;pride&#8221; in being shot in the streets, just so they can get &#8220;street cred&#8221; by their peers; as rap musicians have done? It&rsquo;s all about attitude and personal responsibility.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t care one iota if the so-called rap musicians shot each other to pieces, no more than I cried a river for Tupac Skaur who mercifully left the world on September 13, 1996. The so-called Bantu macho culture exists in Bantus, whether they live in sub-Saharan Africa, Detroit, Harlem NY, Brazil, Jamaica, Haiti, Gary, IN, Suriname, or Barbados.  </p>

<p>Of course you&rsquo;re inclined to believe that, because blacks never admit to their failings and always blame something other than themselves.  There are so many instances of black propensity for crime and violence the world over it&rsquo;s absurd to try to argue that blacks are not prone to these pathologies, just as it is nonsense to argue they do not have less intelligence than any other race in the world today. </p>
<p>Certainly something is at play if there is an African country or two that doesn&rsquo;t have high crime rates, and that &#8220;something&#8221; is likely the knowledge that if they do something wrong a central authority will put a bullet in their heads.</p>
<p>Force, and the threat of force, is the only thing that blacks really understand.</p>

			<p>This is about the silliest &#8220;report&#8221; I&rsquo;ve ever seen on the topic of crime.  Nowhere does it mention the race of these SA men, implying that male violence in SA transends all racial divisions.  My guess is that 99% of all violent crime in SA is committed by black Africans, often against whites.</p>
<p>Black African behavior is subtantially identical wherever they&rsquo;re found, whether it be on the African continent, the Americas, the Caribbean, or in Europe. It&rsquo;s invariably destructive, corrosive, and socially disruptive</p>
<p>And now we have a new wrinkle featuring destruction on a truly epic scale.  Traced back to its origins, American blacks and their ACORN and Democrat enablers are at the epicenter of the world financial crisis.  This whole debacle began with giving mortgages to unqualified minorities, predominately blacks.  Admittedly, this bizarre recklessness quickly spread beyond minority communities with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buying any mortgage paper that came their way, however unqualified the buyers were.</p>
<p>But it began with the brazen buying of black votes, mainly in the inner cities.  Truly remarkable, who would have thought that American blacks could have had the destructive power to shake the world financial system to its foundations.</p>
<p>They should be proud, and when they figure it out they doubtless will be.</p>

			<p>As long as the public perceives this &#8216;crime&rsquo; as being committed against whites, or a large portion of it as being committed against whites, or by extension (those having the trappings of whiteness), the people won&rsquo;t take steps to end it. </p>
<p>I guess the trick is ending the demonization of all things white.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And if race and murder statistics were causally connected then how do we explain the fact that most nations in Africa have murder rates much less than those of Russia and Mexico. Note too that the murder rate in Ivory Coast is less than those of Ukraine, Estonia and Moldova. And Bermuda &mdash; a predominantly black country &mdash; has a murder rate less than those of Scotland, France and Ireland.</p>
<p>Obviously, sociology rather than genetics explains national murder rates world-wide. </p>
<p>Thus I am inclined to believe that it is the extreme brutalising impact of Apartheid that has created the unnatural sociology of the indigeneous South African.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I disagree, whenever blacks are present in advanced high paced modern societies their crime rates go through the roof. Name one western country where this is not the case? their high crime rate is down to the fact that a sizable portion of their population is not cut out for western society, this problem is genetic, just as it for whites who fail and can&rsquo;t be productive.</p>

<p>    I wonder how accurate the crime records are in these Third World countries. Isn&rsquo;t it possible that they have little idea of what is going on in the remote parts of their countries? With corruption so ramped are the records really accurate? What about the overall crime rates including rape, robbery, drug addiction, and other crimes? You only compare murder rates. By the way, isn&rsquo;t Bermuda still under British (white) administration?</p>

			<p>99.9% of violent crime in South Africa is committed by black men aged between 15 and 38. These are not official statistics, but my own personal accounts of murders, rapes and violent crimes happening around me.</p>
<p>My son had a knife stuck in his face. My cousin was shot through the lung. My friend was shot with a shotgun in his lap. My neighbour was shot in the face and killed, a 17 year old family friend was raped&hellip;&hellip;. I could fill this page with personal experience, but one over riding fact emerges. EVERY SINGLE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY A BLACK. Only my neighbour&rsquo;s death appeared in a newspaper, as her husband went on a mission to see justice done as the murderer was let out on bail for a pending charge of armed robbery.   </p>
<p>If a White commits a crime, however insignificant, it will hit headline news and stay there. <br>

			<p>You can kill as many Whites as you want to, without fear of prosecution, but if you even show a picture of a black who has been shot, you will hit headline news and be prosecuted&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

Seven students of the North West University (South Africa) will face disciplinary action about their membership of a racist group which surfaced on the Facebook social network site recently.</p>
<p>NWU spokesperson Phumzile Mmope on Monday said this followed an investigation into the alleged involvement of students registered at the Potchefstroom Campus of the NWU as members of the group.</p>
<p>The Facebook group, &#8220;ek laaik nie &#8216;n houtkop nie, sou what&#8221;, (I don&rsquo;t like woodenheads, so what) also contained other racially abusive words and comments posted by members.</p>
<p>The group apparently also posted a photograph of a white man holding a gun while posing over the trophy of a young black boy lying on the ground.</p>
<p>Mmope said the seven students, of 13 students initially identified, would be charged for contravening a section of the university&rsquo;s statute.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students will be charged because their conduct was detrimental or could have been detrimental to the good name, order, discipline or performance of the work of the university or any part of the university.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said it was expected that the disciplinary hearings of the students would be finalised by the end of October.</p>
<p>It was also decided that due to the approaching exams, none of the students would be suspended ending the finalisation of the process. - Sapa</p>
