<h1><a href="http://www.thestar.com/GTA/Crime/article/526916">Man Jailed 45 Days for Hate Crime</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christina Commisso, Toronto Star, Oct. 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 26-year-old man was sentenced to 45 days in jail after hanging a life-sized skeleton, which was painted black, in front of a house in the town of Georgina.</p>
<p>Luke Granados, of Georgina, pled guilty to the hate crime in a Newmarket court on Sept. 29. He was sentenced on Monday. He was also sentenced to a 12-month probation after he serves his time in jail.</p>
<p>York police spotted the skeleton in late November 2007. It was suspended with a noose around its neck from a flagpole flying a Confederate flag.</p>
<p>In May 2008, Granados was arrested and charged under the hate crime section of the Criminal Code, which states that anyone who promotes or communicates hatred against any identifiable group, other than in a private conversation, is guilty of a hate crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every member of our community needs to be engaged in the fight against hatred,&rdquo; said Chief Armand La Barge of York Regional Police. &ldquo;Those people who target a particular community threaten all communities, and when you victimize one community, you victimize all communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charges were also laid against a second suspect, a 22-year-old man from Georgina. Those charges have been stayed.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Every member of our community needs to be engaged in the fight against hatred,&#8221;</p>
<p>In an atmosphere where only whites can be accused of hatred he&rsquo;s basically saying everyone needs to be engaged in the fight against whites. It could easily fit into the McCarthy era, &#8220;every member of our community needs to be engaged in the fight against communism&#8221;. Except that McCarthy was a courageous and great man willing to sacrifice all in the fight against abuses like this. </p>
<p>They are basically saying individual, like Luke Granados, don&rsquo;t have rights, and only &#8216;groups&rsquo; or &#8216;communities&rsquo; have rights, and it&rsquo;s their highest duty to defend them. I&rsquo;d be interested in knowing when Chief Armand La Barge of the York Regional Police is going to come out and give a speech where he says he supports the white community.<br>

			<p>Yeah, and if a non-white man had a skeleton of a white hanging, nothing would have been done. The police wouldn&rsquo;t have even bothered.</p>

			<p>Welcome to the Ministry of Love. Canada&rsquo;s going insane with PC, the UK as well, and is even beginning to restrict personal liberties (as well as being the most under surveillance state currently). Should the unthinkable happen, and Senator Obama is actually elected, and with a Dem majority in congress, we may be on our way to the Ministry of Love, too. </p>

This is Canada, eh. Which means that probably 30 of those 45 days in the slammer were just for the Confederate flag. </p>

			<p>  You know, I think Canada is actually beyond being saved from itself. They have fallen off the cliff into the catacombs of political correctness and suicide. Too bad, it was a beautiful country.</p>

			<p>&gt; Hate crime today, thought crime tomorrow.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have put it better myself. I&rsquo;d like to know why governments will not tackle the cause of racism but rather use a blanket ban hoping it will it go away. Surely &#8220;racists&#8221; and other assorted &#8220;Far Right&#8221; have valid concerns like any other human being? Why does a democracy that claims to be all inclusive shut out their complaints? Doesn&rsquo;t the denial of speech only make people become more extreme?</p>

			<p>Do you want to hear who I hate most among the people in Toronto? </p>
<p>It is the authorities and police officers.</p>
<p>I am from Ryerson University and there were two men who went racing at night and they ran into an accident and they killed a Pakistani cab driver.  And guess what, the two men did not have to spend a minute in jail.  They were sentenced to a 2 years of probation and during the probation and they will be allowed to go to school and even have a job.</p>
<p>Neither of the two men seems to have been born in Canada.  One seems to be from one of the countries who formerly was a part of the Soviet Union, and the other one is an offspring between a black male and an Asian female and their parents got married in some other country.  his name is Wang-Piao Dumani Ross and Wang is his mother&rsquo;s maiden name.  </p>
<p><a href="http://img399.imageshack.us/img399/6859/facebookje5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img399.imageshack.us/img399/6859/facebookje5.jpg</a></p>
<p>The article from the Toronto star indicating that the two men is sentenced to house arrest only:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/219249" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/219249</a></p>
<p>And a friend of mine (yeah, I am ashamed that he is my friend) took a picture of an eleven year old girl naked from waist up using the webcam and he was ordered to appear in court and he ended up not having to spend a second in jail.  The prosecutor even had the valid evidence.  he even asked me to write a reference letter for him to back him up at the court.  I did write (which I regret) a letter for him, roughly four sentences long.  He insisted he thought she was an adult.  And he hopes the world believes him that it is possible to mistake an eleven year old girl for an adult.  I have not said a word to him ever since.  </p>
<p>And this man hanging a life-sized skeleton, which was painted black, in front of a house in the town of Georgina, was sentenced to 45 days in jail.  He did not physically hurt anyone, and he did not commit any sexual crime, and he did not even steal or damage anyone else&rsquo;s property and he has to serve 45 days in jail?</p>
<p>Thanks AmRen for giving me yet another reason why I must continue to hate the authorities in Toronto.  And let me tell you, I rarely, if ever, use the verb &#8220;hate&#8221;.  </p>
<p>If you want to hear which city is most beautiful and livable in Canada at the moment, it is Montreal.  </p>

			<p>Hate crimes masquerade as being unbiased attempts to stifle racist hate against all races, but in truth it&rsquo;s simply a device used to arrest whites who do anything defiant against non white invaders.  Hate crimes are inherently anti white and are used daily to intimidate whites from resisting non whites. </p>

<p> Only if we let it. We, the people, have more power than any government. If we don&rsquo;t stand up for this couple we only have ourselves to blame. We get what we deserve. We NEED a strong voice to rally around. If we get that we will be saved. Remember we are stronger than any government.<br>

			<p>As a Canadian, I am saddened to see the state of affairs in this country.</p>
<p>What was once and could have continued as the greatest country is very quickly becoming a third world regime.</p>
<p>The smaller cities and rural areas are still ok for the most part, but any large city and surrounding area is suffering from the large black immigration and associated crime, violence, etc etc.</p>
<p>Nothing good ever comes from the black immigration.</p>
<p>I can only hope that the politicians and their families become quick victims of those actions.</p>

Perhaps they need to be reminded that Canada was once  quite friendly to the Confederate flag, when it was flying.</p>
