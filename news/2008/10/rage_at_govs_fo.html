<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MEMBERS of Gov. Paterson&rsquo;s State Police security detail are privately claiming to have been victims of racial discrimination by New York&rsquo;s first black chief executive, The Post has learned.</p>
<p>The allegations, outlined to State Police union leaders and widely discussed among the troopers themselves, stem from a shakeup in their ranks ordered after Paterson took office in March. The shakeup led to the assignment of a large number of new, non-uniformed State Police officers to Paterson&rsquo;s security detail, nearly all of whom are black, State Police sources said.</p>
<p>State Police insiders contended that Clemmie Harris, a former trooper and longtime friend and paid adviser to the governor, has repeatedly told State Police Superintendent Harry Corbett who should be assigned to the governor&rsquo;s security detail.</p>
<p>Both Harris, who retired on an unexplained full medical disability from the State Police 10 years ago and collects an $82,400-a-year annual salary, and Corbett, named to his post by Paterson, are black.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s now a feeling that you have to be black to get ahead on the governor&rsquo;s squad,&#8221; a longtime State Police official told The Post.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just 8 percent of State Police officers are black, according to official figures.</p>

			<p>  If he retired on full disability how can he retain a disability and be a &#8220;long time adviser to the Governor ?<br>
  Was the disability real but temporary and he was near retirement or is he still below retirement age or service time and now recovered ?</p>

			<p>Troopers assigned to a Governor&rsquo;s security detail are traditionally seasoned officers with solid backgrounds, and yes, often of the same  political party as the protectee. It would be interesting to see the records of these new trooper appointees, to see how seasoned and well trained they are, as opposed to what their race and political affiliations are. It might be poetic justice if this governor gets his posterior handed to him because he chose political cronies of &#8220;hls&#8221; race to protect him, rather than competent troopers.</p>

These guys should be thankful and quiet.</p>
<p>If they guard the governor and anything goes wrong, they&rsquo;ll take a double hit. One for the problem and one for being racist and not adequately protecting the man.</p>
<p>They should just pull back and let nature take its course.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an excellent example of how harmful these white multicult idiots can be to the rest of us.  I can guarantee that not one of them can see anything wrong with such bias that is bound to reduce the efficiency of New York law enforcement.</p>
<p>Is there anybody out there who thinks Obama or any black will not do the same thing?  Is there anybody out there who does not think that every single black running for office does so in order to be in a position to elevate blacks someway, but mostly to positions of power?</p>
<p>Separation and secession!  Separation and secession!  That should be our battle cry and our goal, and any whites who don&rsquo;t agree will be banned from living with us for as long as they live and can take up residence with the racist, hate-mongering black elements.<br>

			<p>My Afro colleagues were discussing this yesterday morning (I work in an ultra-Diversity is Strength Civil Service environment where whitey is a minority). Basically they were saying &#8220;Don&rsquo;t hate&#8221; &#8220;Can&rsquo;t We all get along&#8221; and &#8220;He Be blind How would He Know if dey was black or white&#8221;. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to add except the obvious-that Diversity is Not Strength and things look like they can get real bad, especially on the national level now. My Afro colleagues also discuss how they&rsquo;ll cut Obama some slack now BUT post-election he better appoint some brothers. The Obamalama Administration, coupled with a Democratic Congress will be a site to see. I just wonder how what I call the priviliged white boy Liberal fanatics (think Comedy central&rsquo;s John Stewart, the Ivy educated skunks at Talking Points Memo and the daily Kos, think Paul Krugman) will feel when THEY are overlooked in favor of those of more diverse hues, etc.<br>

			<p>Americans should get used to this. If Obama gets elected, it will be like this all over the country. I&rsquo;m sure some of you are aware of the term &#8220;Spoils System&#8221; as it relates to politics. For those of you who aren&rsquo;t, let me explain how it works. The term &#8220;Spoils System&#8221; refers to a person who wins an executive position nominating friends, close allies, and supporters to various governmental positions as a form of gratitude for their help during the campaign. These positions include but aren&rsquo;t limited to things like judicial appointments, cabinet positions, and various legal positions such as prosecutors. One of the things that should scare White Americans the most is that the President controls the Justice Department by way of appointments. The Attorney General is the head of the Justice Department. Who nominates the A.G.? The President. It&rsquo;s the same all over that department. If Obama gets elected, you can be sure that he will put his friends into those positions. Since his friends are almost exclusively Blacks and far left Whites, it doesn&rsquo;t take much to figure out what our legal landscape will look like within a few years. Imagine Blacks controlling our police departments and the criminal justice system. One of the biggest problems that any police department has with Black Officers are sexual harassment complaints. Black Cops routinely demand sexual favors in exchange for lenient treatment. On many occasions they go out of their way to pull over attractive females (i.e. White ones) to try to get these favors. Blacks and Hispanic Cops are also known for ignoring minority crimes, specifically gang activity, because they either know members of that gang or are simply afraid to confront them. This is just the beginning. America is taking a very dark turn. (Pun intended) The only comfort I take in all this is that these changes appear to be happening faster then I ever anticipated. I had always assumed that America wouldn&rsquo;t make such a visual transformation until Whites had finally lost their majority position in this country. It appears it&rsquo;s happening sooner. With Obama probably fixing to get elected, and the looming economic disaster, America could see a revolution very soon. Maybe it&rsquo;s just me, but I sense a very low but deep anger boiling underneath the surface of White America. Take the immigration debate for example. As a White Person, I object to the mass movement of non-whites into my country. Most American agree with me, although they don&rsquo;t site the same reason I do, however that is the root of it. Many Whites will vehemently deny that race plays any part in their objection to illegal immigration, but any rational person knows that race is the central reason why Whites are opposed to it, as it should be. Most Whites subconsciously understand what a threat mass migration of alien people into their borders means, but they delude themselves into thinking it&rsquo;s other things. When the recent &#8220;Amnesty Bill&#8221; went before Congress, the Congressional phone lines were shut down because of all the angry calls coming in from constituents (largely white). Today I saw video footage of McCain supporters protesting outside of an early voting center in North Carolina. The voting center was opened on a Sunday, which hasn&rsquo;t been done before, while coincidentally an Obama Rally was going on not far from the site. The level of anger among these protesters was clear. Recent footage from recent McCain rallies shows an almost violent nature coming over McCain supporters, or should I say &#8220;Obama Opposers&#8221;. I believe that these are just a few examples of the deep anger boiling just under the surface. The only thing that I think keeps Whites from rioting in the street is the economy. We have too much to lose. For the time being, we still control most of the wealth in America. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to convince anybody of why they should pick up their guns, march outside their 300 thousand dollar home, jump in their SUV, drive downtown and start the revolution. Take away that wealth and it&rsquo;s a different ball game. The explosives are already in place, the powder&rsquo;s just wet. It&rsquo;s drying fast though, and Obama&rsquo;s holding a match.    </p>

<p>O.K., just what are the odds of having two Black State Superintendents in a force comprised of 92% non-Black within 10 years? </p>
<p>In addition, affirmative-action appears to be a runaway success with New York having a black governor and now the United States is expected to have a black president, so it&rsquo;s time to end the program ASAP! Dream on, I say to myself.</p>

<p>Absolutely perfect point to emphasize just what this incident, plus dozens of similar ones really mean, Charlie.</p>
<p>Blacks do not want equality.  They want power and domination.  And obviously they&rsquo;re too dense to see what both have gotten them in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Detroit and New Orleans, where Forest Gump would be regarded as a gifted intellectual if he were black. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right. After Andrew Jackson became President in 1828, he systematically rewarded his supporters by starting the Second Party System. He considered that popular election gave the victorious party a &#8220;mandate&#8221; to select officials from its own ranks. The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act was supposed to end it but we see it occurring today despite that in Democratic administrations. </p>

			<p>Most self hating liberal whites will applaud Obama appointing record numbers of blacks to the highest positions in this land.</p>
<p>And if things go wrong for whites, they will actually believe they DESERVE mistreatment by their government as some sort of payback!</p>
<p>The truth is, blacks like Rice and Powell as just tokens have not really had much influence. I&rsquo;m certain they don&rsquo;t generally get their way when it comes to making big decisions.</p>
<p>But in a black administration, voodoo and superstition - and mostly just plain bad thinking - will rule the day. White members of the cabinet who consistently make the most sense and win the arguements will sooner or later be resented by Obama and his black team - who will certainly band together along racial lines (think payback). They will start doing just about ANYTHING to avoid letting the &#8216;white guys&rsquo; decide everything - including making bad decisions just to show who is boss.</p>
<p>And it will get ugly real fast.</p>
<p>Baby boomers, mostly white, are retiring in massive numbers. Almost 90% of them are being replaced by blacks and hispanics at all levels of government - even without an Obama presidency.</p>
<p>The incompetence, as if bad enough, will absolutely explode like a nuke. God help any whites ensnared by an IRS audit team headed by or entirely comprised of angry and vindictive blacks.</p>
<p>As an example, I know someone who works at a company that is very liberal in its hiring policies - lots of asians, hispanics, blacks, etc. To get a government contract several years ago, they had to meet even stricter EEOC guidelines. Well the blacks came in (80% of EEOC employees are black and have been for decades!) and treated EVERYONE as if they were criminals hiding evidence of racism and bigotry under every desk and filing cabinet. </p>
<p>Did my liberal friend wake up to the truth even as she told me what happened, and how shocked she was to be treated like that?</p>
<p>Sadly, no. Not at all in fact. And she&rsquo;s voting Obama of course.</p>
<p>My friends, this country is in for a world of hurt. And we&rsquo;re going to have a front row seat to the show I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>

<p>Since when have blacks repressed the urge to dominate whites? Or the urge to hire or promote their own first? You have to have a Conscience first. I&rsquo;m not sure blacks have one.  </p>

<p>You mean like Detroit, New Orleans, Rhodesia or South Africa?  Yeah man.  I guess they showed up those honkies, didn&rsquo;t they?  LOL!</p>
<p>This blind fool, my man, has just prevented himself from being re-elected. I read today where he wants to run again in order to get a full term.  If he makes it to the next election, he&rsquo;ll be defeated in a landslide, and he will have revealed to the world where he&rsquo;s really coming from.</p>
<p>This is an instance where the dumbing down of tests to get these blacks on the force is enabling this black retard to show his true colors, if you&rsquo;ll pardon the pun.</p>
<p>By all means, let&rsquo;s see even worse from the Obamanation if he gets elected.  And let&rsquo;s pray the economy sinks to new levels and the social situation evolves into civil war.  Worse is better to those of us who want this country to implode.</p>
<p>I can gurantee you you won&rsquo;t be thinking of payback after Nov 4, if the Obanation makes any wrong moves at all.  Your mind will be concentrated solely on survival.</p>
<p>Blacks are incapable of reasoning in a coherent manner, because their evolvement on this planet is years behind every other race. Blacks are the low men on humanity&rsquo;s totem pole.</p>
<p>They also elect to do things that will eventually destroy them.  </p>
