<h1>Voodoo Linked to Cobb County Election</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A woman who practices voodoo in South Carolina claims commissioner Annette Kesting wanted her to put a curse on the opponent who defeated Kesting in August.</p>
<p>The voodoo priestess, George Ann Mills of Blythewood, S.C., filed a report with Cobb County police claiming Kesting&rsquo;s checks for the ceremony bounced.</p>
<p>Kesting was soundly defeated in mid-August, and according to the voodoo priestess she wanted challenger Woody Thompson to either develop cancer or be involved in a car wreck.</p>
<p>The woman claims Kesting gave her pictures of Thompson and wrote her $3,000 worth of checks, but those checks bounced.</p>
<p>The voodoo rituals were apparently never performed.</p>

															<h2>Kesting Denies Visiting Voodoo Priestess</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Kent A. Miles, Kay Powell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, October 6, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>The Blythewood, S.C., &#8220;priestess&#8221; said she was approached in late August by Cobb County Commissioner Annette Kesting. Kesting was seeking otherworldly help, Mills said, against Democrat Woody Thompson, who defeated Kesting in the primary runoff vote for the District 4 seat representing southwest Cobb.</p>
<p>Mills has accused Kesting, a first-term commissioner, of writing $3,000 in bounced checks for her services.</p>
<p>Kesting on Tuesday denied ever meeting Mills.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mills, 55, has had some experience with bad checks. Public records show Mills has a record going back to 1997 for passing fraudulent checks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mills said when Kesting visited her, she held up a photo of a man she said was Thompson.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said, &lsquo;Do you see cancer in him?&rsquo; I said he looks like a very healthy man,&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;She said, &lsquo;Is there anything you can do about this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. give him cancer, or make him have an accident or something?&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>Mills said she refused, saying she didn&rsquo;t want Thompson&rsquo;s blood on her hands. She offered to &#8220;make trouble for him, to make people see who he really is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of performing a ritual for Thompson, Mills said she sacrificed a chicken and three roosters to provide protection for Kesting and her son, who Kesting said was adrift. In return for her services, she says Kesting wrote two checks totaling $3,000, which were returned for insufficient funds. Kesting then sent two $1,000 money orders in payment. Mills produced a copy of a MoneyGram receipt, dated Aug. 28. The receipt, faxed to the AJC, listed Kesting&rsquo;s husband, Christian, as the sender.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kesting&rsquo;s term as commissioner has been marked by unflattering financial disclosures and personal blunders. She was delinquent in paying taxes to the county in 2007 for properties she owned in Powder Springs, and also was written up for code violations on several of her properties.</p>
<p>Then, in February, Kesting appeared before a Marietta church and gave an inflammatory speech in which she criticized some workers at the county government headquarters. At a news conference several days later, Kesting blamed dirty politics and the news media for the uproar. She called it part of a conspiracy to drive her out of office.<br>

			<p>The bank must have records of the checks so if checks were passed, it should be easy to prove or disprove the association.</p>
<p>This voodoo stuff would be funny if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that these people take it seriously and act accordingly. <br>

			<p>As even a rank layman from my part of the country knows: a chicken and three roosters is not part of the correct voodoo - hoodoo - zudoo ritual for cancer. This was merely to cause &#8220;bad luck&#8221; and as such it was clearly overpriced at three thousand dollars. Seven hundred fifty tops!</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the ethnic pigmentation of protagonist in this drama. Consequently, it is not surprising that she did not know the correct price for this particular service. Conversely, the High Priestess did not know that the checks would bounce! One would therefore naturally suspect that the High Priestess is also a member of the politically correct and cognizable minority as well. </p>
<p>Who knows, maybe Woody had a large investment in the market? </p>
<p>Under the circumstances Ms. Kesting should be somewhat concerned that the next curse will be placed &hellip;.. on her! After all voodo is real isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>I wonder what Annette Kesting&rsquo;s IQ is?  But it would be so racist to inquire.  But seriously, how stupid and primitive to think that voodoo can cause cancer.</p>
<p>This is what affirmative action has wrought.  And they run every government agency.</p>

			<p>Her proof of innocent was this:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I have no idea who Ms. Mills is,&rdquo; Kesting said. &ldquo;My car won&rsquo;t let me get to South Carolina. I know nobody in South Carolina.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>And after the checks bounced they sent two money orders as partial payment, they do have a record of those. Though I give credit to the Priestess for not casting a death spell for money, the woman sounds like a sincere believer.</p>

			<p>You would be surprised how many blacks firmly believe in Voodoo. This is especially true of blacks from the Caribbean.</p>

			<p>This is a mere part of what is happening all over this country.  Even over the road truck drivers have reported that there are areas of New Orleans that you do not want to end up in.  There are tales of kidnappings and voodoo practices in all parts of Louisiana, including acquiring scalps to practice this so-called religion.  This is what liberals like to call inclusion, tolerance and diversity.  I call it third world trash.</p>

			<p> Honestly, anyone who has lived in the deep South for any period of time know that blacks believe in Root (South Carolina) or Hoodoo (Louisiana). I&rsquo;ve seem plates in cemeteries with coins arranged in a certain way and chalked symbols on graves. People will not disturb these magical charms. It isn&rsquo;t just the rural folks who believe, even educated urban blacks have been known to believe.</p>
