<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world/20081007/EU.Austria.Asylum.Seekers/">Far-Right Austria Governor Isolates Asylum Seekers</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, October 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Far-right Gov. Joerg Haider has set up a facility in the remote mountains of southern Austria to handle asylum seekers suspected as criminals, saying they need to be isolated to protect the people in the area.</p>
<p>Haider gained international prominence in 1999 when the Freedom Party, which he then headed, took 27 percent of the vote in Austria&rsquo;s parliamentary elections. The party&rsquo;s subsequent inclusion in the government led to months of European Union sanctions over Haider&rsquo;s statements, which were seen as anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic and sympathetic to Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s labor policies.</p>
<p>Haider is now governor of Carinthia province and his regional government set up the facility for asylum seekers, which sits in a secluded pasture in the mountains of southern Austria at an altitude of about 3,900 feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this security precaution, we are protecting the Carinthian population,&#8221; Haider told a news conference Monday. He said the number of criminal asylum seekers was on the rise.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said that the asylum seekers were allowed to move about freely on the premises but were being monitored.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The building has the capacity to hold 50 but currently houses five men and has been in use for about a week. Petzner confirmed media reports saying the five came from Georgia, Kazakhstan and Gambia. He did say some in the group had been convicted, but did not say of what.</p>
<p>Petzner said residents would be &#8220;under constant observation so that no criminal acts can be committed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Carinthia currently has about 900 asylum seekers in total.</p>
<p>Roland Schoenbauer, officer-in-charge of the Vienna branch of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said his office had asked Carinthian authorities to provide details about the conditions in the facility and those working there.</p>
<p>Schoenbauer also criticized the practice &mdash; by Haider and others &mdash; of associating asylum seekers with crime.</p>

			<p>With the european union on the verge of collapse (personally, I don&rsquo;t think it will last out the year), who cares what they think or what sanctions they bring to bear.  Austria would be well served and well positioned to simply expel foriegners and institute protectionist economic policies.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be long until ALL the former EU states do the same.  They really have little choice.  The alternative is poverty, violence, even anarchy.  Not years from now but months.</p>

			<p>Asylum is newspeak for welfare.  And &#8220;African Immigrant&#8221;, you have no rights to other person&rsquo;s property.  I know this concept is difficult for you to understand.  That is why Africa is, was, and always will be a hellhole.</p>

			<p>&#8220;political asylum&#8221; is nothing but a scam by people who have made a mess of their own countries and are now looking for fresh pickin&rsquo;s elsewhere in white societies. So, it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me African immigrants masquerading as &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221; would be hoping for the socialists to &#8220;re-emerge&#8221; so they can get back to collecting welfare off the backs of the taxpaying white citizens of the host country.</p>

<p>Yeah right while the socialist create and perpetuate the marginalization of immigrants which leads to vicious cycle and many social ills in society. Joerg Haider is right treating criminals with kid gloves needs to stop period. The assassination of Pim Fortuyn by socialist nut-casses proves that they are the biggest menace to freedom and democracy.</p>

			<p>African Immigrant, don&rsquo;t look for sympathy here. You people bring terror with you. Terror is part of your culture. Go back where you came from, to use a hackneyed but apt expression. There you can wield your machete and terrorise those neighbours from other tribes who part their hair differently. Of course, you won&rsquo;t get the social security benefits you think the advanced, civilised world owes you. You people had the opportunity to be guided by white rule. Instead, you turned your countries into cesspits. Now you come after claiming human rights and support that you people cannot achieve amongst yourselves. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your terror, your fear, your barbarity. You keep it.</p>

&#8220;FAR-RIGHT AUSTRIA GOVERNOR ISOLATES ASYLUM SEEKERS&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far-right Gov. Joerg Haider has set up a facility in the remote mountains&hellip;.&#8221; <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Just note how this article is written. The very FIRST word of the title is &#8220;far-right&#8221;!   And the very first word of the first sentence of the first paragraph is also &#8220;far-right&#8221;.   AP really wants you to get that message, don&rsquo;t they?  That word seems to be more important than the story. They couldn&rsquo;t just say &#8220;Gov. Joerg Haider has set up a facility in&hellip;&#8221;  </p>
<p>Since when is protecting the local population from criminal aliens considered to be &#8220;far right&#8221;?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s particularly interesting is that this news item is not a mere solitary example.  It is the <i>universal pattern </i> that is followed by the media to practically shreik the words &#8220;far-right&#8221; or &#8220;extreme-right&#8221;, as if they are following some kind of guidebook structions mandating that this is the way in which ALL such stories MUST be written.</p>

<p>The multicultural mess in the USA and EU have been proving grounds that the experiment has failed miserably&hellip;please note there are very few people from Europe attempting to re-settle Pakistan or the Congo.  </p>
<p>Not many asylum seekers in Zimbabwe, correct?</p>

			<p>No African immigrant you do not have the right to live anywhere in the world you want to. Your arrogance is exceeded only by your ignorance! Our ancestral homelands are ours not yours. You may be invited in as a guest but that is all you will ever be. Live in your own country!</p>
<p>The only reason you can move to white countries is because our traitorous politicians want to destroy the nation state and build some Marxist one world utopia. When we nationalists take power we will deal with them for the crimes they have committed against the white peoples of Europe and America. </p>
<p>Then as for people like you it will be back to your cesspit and no return. Less of your arrogance. You are on borrowed time like all the other scoungers who come to the west and take our resources.</p>

			<p>African immigrant, you don&rsquo;t have the right to live anywhere in the world. No one has that right.  But your kind of thinking, so common among entitlement-obsessed blacks, is just one of a multitude of reasons your race is disliked.  Bottom line, Africans don&rsquo;t belong in Europe.  I hope you enjoy whatever time you have left in Austria, because the day you&rsquo;re sent back home to Mama Africa is soon coming.</p>

Perhaps some of you don&rsquo;t agree with what Haider is doing but it is a step in the right direction I think.  Schoenbauer has a problem associating immigrants with crime - much in the same way people were loath to associate unclean water with cholera or HIV with AIDS.  Each is an expensive lesson to learn.</p>

<p>NOBODY has the right to live anywhere in the world they want. People have the right to live in the country that they are a citizen of. I&rsquo;m a citizen of the USA so I have the right to live here but I don&rsquo;t have the right to leave the USA and go live in Nigeria or Kenya for example because I&rsquo;m not a citizen.</p>
<p> &#8220;For the record, I am assuming you are american, your nation is nothing but a bunch of immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the record, EVERY nation on earth is made up of people who immigrated/migrated at some point in history. The USA today is made up of citizens who were born and raised here, not immigrants, just like every other country.</p>

<p>Oh really you do? Well, then I guess african countries won&rsquo;t mind one bit if thousands or even millions of whites from America or Europe or wherever decide to just pack up and settle in africa, right? Actually at one time, whites did go to africa and let&rsquo;s see, they called it colonization and africans said whites had no right to be there. So the whites eventually left as they should have. So &#8220;african immigrant&#8221; you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s wrong when whites go to a black country illegally and colonize it but it&rsquo;s ok for you, correct?<br>

			<p>  &ldquo;I have a right to live anywhere in the world I want to. For the record, I am assuming you are american, your nation is nothing but a bunch of immigrants.&rdquo;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>I am in my 70&rsquo;s, and you can take it from one who&rsquo;s old enough to know, we never heard any of this type of stuff before the immigration laws were changed in the mid-6os   &mdash;    nor even for quite some time after that.  There had never been any such notion that just anyone could come here or live wherever they want.  Now, they insist it&rsquo;s their  &#8220;right&#8221;!</p>
<p>Our left-wing governments and politicians and churchmen paved the way for this.  People like this &#8220;African immigrant&rsquo; have this notion today, BECAUSE WE GAVE IT TO THEM.</p>
<p>This is a good example of biting the hand that reaches out to help you.  We took pity on some and allowed them to immigrate here. Now they demand to come here as their right. </p>

			<p> Joerg Haider is dead! He was killed in a traffic accident over the weekend. He is another martyr like the late Dutchman Pim Fortyn. Alas, European politicians who oppose Third World immigration don&rsquo;t seem to last long.  Thanks for the effort. Requiscat in Pace.<br>

			<p>I say Austria is sovereign and they need to kick both the foreigner and internationalists out.  Both are foreign and work against the indigenous Austrian peoples desire for sovereignty and traditional way of life they are entitled.</p>
