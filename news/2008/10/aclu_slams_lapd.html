	<p>Blacks and Latinos are more likely than whites to be stopped, searched and arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department, according to a report released Monday by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ACLU looked at 810,000 field stops between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2004. The group found there were 4,569 stops per 10,000 black residents, compared to 1,750 stops per 10,000 white residents.</p>
<p>Black and Latino residents were more than twice as likely than whites to be ordered out of their vehicles. They also were more likely to be searched during that stop.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A report presented to the Police Commission in August found that 19 police agencies from across the country received 371 racial profiling complaints over a two-year period, and four were substantiated.<br>

			<p>The ACLU know that this is a losing proposition for the LAPD since the less the police stop suspected Black and Hispanic suspects the more emboldened the Black and Hispanic criminal become, the more they push the limits of criminal behavior and the more the police are required to confront them. And what does the ACLU have to worry, none of their members live anywhere near<br>
Black or Hispanic neighborhoods.</p>

Well, its obvious the ACLU is aware of the problem. Perhaps they can come up with a few suggestions on how to get the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; to behave themselves.</p>

			<p>Maybe the police department should be forced to label more white neighborhoods as a &#8216;known drug area&rsquo; to even things out. Perhaps things can only be solved by whites perpetrate their fair share of crime. I&rsquo;m sure the ACLU can be counted on to keep us abreast. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve said this often and repeat,the ACLU, is an organization of people, who,  under the guise of seperation of church and state search the nation from one end to the other for the removal of tiny crosses and other Christian religious symbols, although they&rsquo;ve never investigated any church for giving asylum to illegal aliens. The ACLU also gives aid to illegal alien foreign nationals, they worry about the protection of the hardest criminals, and in fact, except  when they take time out for a few moments to pretend to protect Americans interests, they&rsquo;re working fanatically, against Americans best interests. You can be sure they always have something in the frying pan against Americans best interests.</p>

			<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be because blacks and Hispanics are more likely to drive recklessly, more likely to drive drunk, more likely to ignore traffic lights and stop signs or more likely to just generally behave like juvenile delinquents. Naw, it couldn&rsquo;t be that at all. It must be racism. Yeah, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>

			<p>The only kind of whites left in L.A. are rich whites that live in the hills.  And what is the likelihood that they would commit a violent crime?  Virtually all of the criminality in L.A. is black and Hispanic.  Really, they should be stopped more than they are, as a matter of percentages.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s get behind the ACLU and demand that non-whites be left alone.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s insist that non-whites get preferential treatment, more probation and suspended sentences for the crimes they commit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s insist that police leave suspected gang bangers alone and that they should not report illegals when they are found to be in this country illegally.</p>
<p>California is not only going broke and will not be able to even borrow its way free in a couple of years, and the crime and chaos there, racial killings and fighting, are all on the increase. The resources are so strained the area cannot sustain many more people.    Any complaints we make are answered with accusations of racism.  </p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get behind a push for the police to just leave non-whites alone, and shower them with compliments on having such a fine multicultural utopia.  </p>
<p>Then let&rsquo;s see how things turn out. </p>

			<p>Instances of this garden-variety MultiCulti &#8220;error&#8221; (can it really be called an error when pointing it out is forbidden?) are a dime a dozen and quite boring to me at this point:</p>
<p>1) assume all ethnic groups behave identically<br>
2) based on 1, make unfounded accusations<br>
3) forbid anyone pointing out 1 is unproven, on pain of excommunication</p>
<p>This is why (inter alia) the idiots at the ACLU don&rsquo;t blame mestizos and blacks for their uncivilized behavior.</p>

			<p>Of course they are. Blacks and Hispanics make up 11. 2% and 46.5% respectively (though the 2009 census is going to be changed because a large numbers of latinos declare white on the census to skew the data meaning the Hispanic population is actually much greater than 46.5%). </p>

			<p>Gimme a break.  The illegal alien hispanics out here simply run amuck.  No insurance, no registered plates, no license and driving around in battered-up junks.  And did I mention drunk?  Add that to the well known fact that blacks are 7 times more likely to break the law than whites and tell me just who are they supposed to be stopping?</p>
<p>If anything, they handle these dregs with kid gloves knowing that discrimination complaints are the norm.</p>

			<p>The LAPD is a left-wing activist organization, from the wildly leftist Police Chief, William Bratton, on down through the brass, and because the chief sets policy, on down through the ranks. If he really looked into the situation, the The Ivy League economist who wrote this report must surely know the politics, policies, and practices of the LAPD. </p>

			<p>&#8221;Ayres, however, said one officer stopped more than 100 blacks and 100 Hispanics but only one white. The professor did not include that officer in his analysis because it was an extreme situation and could skew results.&#8221; </p>
<p>Probably because area he patrolled only had one white household in it. </p>
<p>Never mentioned in &#8216;studies&rsquo; like this one is the racial mix of each patrol area resembles the residents as closely as possible with active personnel. </p>
<p>Another thing not mentioned is the cultural differences the suspect brings to the situation. As a child it was strongly suggested to my siblings and I that if we were ever stopped by any officer, the proper attitude was to be very polite, and the response to any question had to include a respectful &#8216;Sir&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Not exactly what your average child learns from &#8216;the street&rsquo;.</p>

<p>And is this so because (presumably mostly white) police officers are racist? Or is it that blacks and hispanics are more prone to crime and the officers who stop them are more rational than the ACLU would like to give them credit for?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I used to be a card-carrying member of the ACLU myself, and have attended many ACLU-sponsored lectures and get togethers. I still share many of their civil libertarian ideals on free speech, privacy, freedom from government surveillance, human rights, and other issues. But when it comes to what they call &#8220;racial justice&#8221; in their list of issues, this liberal refuses to be a leftoid clone. It was when they started to monitor the Minuteman, looking for a pretext to sue them, that I dropped my membership in disgust.</p>
<p>If poor and working-class minorities suffer, liberal leftoids care very, very deeply. If poor and working-class whites suffer, the leftoids couldn&rsquo;t care less. Why is the ACLU so obsessed with minority rights? Could it be because their organization is run mostly by white minorities?</p>

<p>Your comments about crime are true, but your comments about Whites is not. There are many Whites in California that are &#8220;middle-class&#8221;. I have a blue-collar type job in LA where I make about 35k. I make twice the California minimum wage, but it&rsquo;s still barely enough to survive. There are many poor Whites in LA as well. Many people like myself don&rsquo;t have the money to leave. Even if we had the money to leave, nobody wants White refugees from California moving to their areas, as someone last week said we, &#8220;infect the surrounding Western states with our Californication&#8221;. White Californians are an infection? Most White Californians aren&rsquo;t even from California. I&rsquo;m from Pennsylvania. I moved here after the Army for college. The people of Oregon, Washington, Utah and Nevada don&rsquo;t want us moving there, but they&rsquo;re accepting Mexicans by the thousands. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense. In the end I&rsquo;ll move back to Pennsylvania, after I finish my masters, maybe sooner if Obama wins. I feel sorry for those people out here who have nowhere else to go, or no money to get there. </p>

			<p>This is great publicity!!</p>
<p>Let the ACLU or anyone else make a big stink about Racial Profiling good and bad. We need all the publicity we can get IF, IF, IF we then send to all we can crime data and information that shows the huge crime rate gap between whites, blacks and browns. </p>
<p>This is where education is important to promote the White Cause and White Culture. </p>
<p>So the more noise that is made about racial profiling, the greater the opportunity to offer a proper response, defense and even offense of the truth: Blacks and Hispanics have a much higher tendency to commit crimes in America.</p>
<p>Time to reinforce what EVERYONE knows but doesn&rsquo;t have the ammunition to discuss or take a stand.</p>

			<p>The ACLU was founded by supreme court justice Louis Brandeis a very hard leftist and millionaire Roger Baldwin who proudly proclaimed himself a communist.</p>
<p>It was founded around 1920 on the orders of Lenin to facilitate the communist revolution in this country by creating all sorts of &#8220;rights&#8221; and &#8220;liberties&#8221; that would make prosecutions for treason, subversion and insurrection impossible.  ACLU has succeeded in these goals all too well.</p>
<p>At the same time a similiar organization was founded in Britian.</p>
<p>Allegedly it would defend civil liberties.  Actually it would tweak the justice system to the point where it would be impossible to prosecute traitors and revolutionaries. The British organization disappeared because the British do not have the enormous tax deductions for charitable and educational donations we have in America.  </p>
<p>Virtually all the most subversive and anti white organizations in America are funded by these tax deductible donations.  </p>
<p>If whites really want to fight back, the first thing we must do is DEFUND THE LEFT!!  The easiest way to do this would be to get rid of the tax deductions for charitable donations.  That is what has funded the left for decades.  Next step would be to tax the anti white foundations on their billion dollar investment funds. We all know them, Tides, Ford, Rockefeller, Annenberg etc etc etc.</p>
<p>ACLU, SPLC etc would not exist but for these tax deductible donations.</p>
<p>Along with the ACLU, American communists founded the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born around 1920.  This was not a pro immigration group.  </p>
<p>Its purpose was to defend communists because in 1920 most of the communists were foreign born.  Foreigners of the Emma Goldman, Leon Berkowitz, Leon Czolgowz, Julius Hammer, Nicholas Horowitz, Boris Reinstein type.</p>
<p><br>
ACLU was always intended to destroy America.  And it is succeeding. 1920&rsquo;s Russia, 2000 Muslims, 2008 American blacks.  ACLU doesn&rsquo;t care who destroys America and its white population as long as it is someone.  Communist atheists, promiscous libertines, puritanical religious fanatic muslims whatever.</p>
<p>ACLU motto.  The enemy of America is my friend whoever, whatever, wherever, whenever</p>
<p>As my Mom always told me, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t listen to what the boys say, watch what they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to what the ACLU says about truth and justice and civil liberties.  Watch what they do; destroy whites.</p>

<p>Cab driver charged with sexual assault </p>
<p>10:12 AM CDT on Wednesday, October 22, 2008</p>
<p>By NOELLE NEWTON<br>
KVUE News </p>
<p>AUSTIN, Texas   &mdash;   Police are searching for a cab driver who they say sexually assaulted an unconscious customer. </p>
<p>They say the woman was too drunk to drive Saturday night, so a bar worker called a cab for her. Police say the driver took advantage of the situation. </p>
<p>It was in the 400 block of East 6th Street where police say Yellow Cab driver Olaniran Awogbami picked up the intoxicated woman. She passed out during the ride and woke up to being sexually assaulted. </p>
<p>&#8220;When she woke up he was on top of her. At that time she forcibly tried to get him off of her and was unable to do that,&#8221; Detective James Mason said. </p>

			<p>B.B. I utterly disagree. The ACLU has not been great on most issues. Just a few days ago, Chertoff, suggested forcing more stringent rules that would absolutely not allow employers to hire people illegally in the nation. The ACLU was quick. lightening quick to file suit, along with the Chamber of Congress  &mdash;  as usual. All I can think of calling these people is traitors to the citizenry. We have to get the enforcement of our laws under control and the ACLU is a major player in allowing the chaos. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t care if so called &#8220;respected&#8221; people like Gore Vidal are members. He&rsquo;s wrong. He and his ilk aren&rsquo;t little gods, as leftists tend to treat them. I&rsquo;ve notice that so many of these little gods adored by the ACLU, live in other nations, while meddling in this one continually. To me they are &#8220;agents of chaos&#8221;, troublers of America. Do they have some good points? Yes, but their other activities tend to nullify those good points, and then some.</p>

			<p>If they are more likely to be ordered out of their vehicles and searched, it is entirely possible that this is because blacks and Hispanics are also more likely to have prior convictions - possibly for violence and/or drugs and still be under some form of court supervision.  Nothing helps a policeman think you might be up to no good than a prior turning up on his National Criminal Intelligence Center check on you via the computer in his car.  They do that right after they pull you over, so they understand exactly who they are dealing with before they approach your vehicle.</p>
<p>The last time I was pulled over, it was 43 mph in a 40 zone.  I had picked up a little speed going downhill, and it was the beginning of the school year, so the police were being a bit more vigorous in their enforcement.</p>
<p>After I stopped, he asked me why my car had Boulder-area plates, so I simply explained that my mother had driven my car for the three years I was locked up because the Saturn got better gas mileage than her Mazda RX-7, and that when it came time to renew the registration, she did it in Boulder, where she lives.  The officer was satisfied with my answer, gave me a warning, and let me go.</p>

			<p>Thank God for this.  Blacks and Mexicans SHOULD be stopped and searched more often?  </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they commit more crimes!  It&rsquo;s in their blood.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t is funny (but not actually amusing) that the only time a person ever hears a peep out of a &#8216;Civil Liberties&rsquo; Cadre is when they are defending the &#8216;rights&rsquo; of criminals. I&rsquo;ve seen them on the news defending the &#8216;rights&rsquo; of the nastiest rapists and paedophiles all the way down to the &#8216;rights&rsquo; of a trashy break-and-enter drug addict. Nothing about the victims whose &#8216;rights&rsquo; were violated in the first place is  mentioned however. Not only that, any attempted advancements by the police forces to deal with such riff-raff is shouted down by this lot. A previous correspondent here mentioned that Bernadine Dorhn is on the board. No wonder there considering her criminal history!</p>
