<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20081007/Immigration.Raid/">300 Suspected Illegal Immigrants Caught in SC Raid</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, October 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal agents swept through a chicken processing plant Tuesday, detaining more than 300 suspected illegal immigrants, sending panicked workers running and screaming through the hallways. Worried relatives collected outside, fearful their loved ones would be deported.</p>
<p>Police and agents during a shift change ordered all workers at the House of Raeford&rsquo;s Columbia Farms to show identification, according to officials and witnesses. The business had been under scrutiny for months and the raid comes on the heels of even larger roundups at plants across the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration officials kept the workers inside, spending most of the morning trying to figure out how many are in the country illegally, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin McDonald said.</p>
<p>The number could be substantial. A recent review found that immigration paperwork for more than 775 of 825 workers contained false information, McDonald said. Immigration agents scoured the plant for paperwork and other information for the investigation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>House of Raeford processes chickens and turkeys in eight plants in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana and Michigan. A sales manager at the Greenville plant referred questions to the company&rsquo;s Rose Hill, N.C., headquarters, where a woman answering the phone said there was no immediate comment.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors and immigration agents have been investigating the plant&rsquo;s hiring practices for several months. Eleven supervisors and the plant&rsquo;s human resources director have been charged, most accused of falsifying documents. Seven have pleaded guilty, three are awaiting trial and two have fled, McDonald said.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Walt Wilkins wouldn&rsquo;t say whether other plants or executives were being investigated.</p>

			<p>From the article, &hellip;..Worried relatives collected outside, fearfull their loved ones would be deported.</p>
<p>If immigration law would be taken seriously by our traitorous &#8220;leaders&#8221;,including McCain and Obama, then these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t be so fearfull. After a full nationwide crackdown got going underway, I mean where hundreds of thousands, no millions, are issued deoportation orders, all fear would subside and be replaced with the realization that they, afterall, have no premission to be in this nation and are violating its laws by their very presence here.</p>

<p>Sound like 775 people should be charged with felonies!  Falsifying immigration and social security documents is a felony; if I used fake documents to work under a false identity, I&rsquo;d be in <b>prison</b>.  </p>
<p>So what is the excuse for not prosecuting illegals for felony ID falsification/theft??  </p>

			<p>300&hellip;snort&hellip;<br>
I can take you to a intersection within sight of the US Capitol<br>
where 10,000 illegals gather looking for day jobs everyday</p>
<p>From the 495 Beltway turn South on New Hampshire Ave. Drive<br>
South for 5 miles..this neighborhood has 50,000 illegal aliens<br>
minimum. The shopping center know as &#8220;Langley Park Crossroads&#8221;<br>
has 5000 illegals standing around any given workday morning.<br>
As the day wears on they play soccer, cook food on the sidewalks,<br>
and begin drinking.. the gang fights start up a little later.</p>
<p>So where is ICE? Hmmm?</p>

			<p>South Carolina has a rather large unemployment rate (a large Black population), so finally since these illegals will luckily be deported the many unemployed LEGAL citizens in SC who claim they cannot find jobs will be able to fill these hundreds of jobs in relatively short order.</p>

			<p>Too much effort expended at the bottom and not enough at the top.  Arrest most of the management, throw them in prison for 50 years, in general population with mexican gangs, and this behavior will stop&hellip;.I guarantee.</p>

			<p>The neocons flooded this country with poor immigrants to get the lowest labor cost and the dumbocrats found out that if they gave them all citizenship the immigrants would vote for them so they could get goodies. Now it&rsquo;s tanking but nobody&rsquo;s realized yet that until you remove the people who shouldn&rsquo;t be here and stop more from entering (not to mention ending chain migration), nothing is going to get structurally better.</p>

			<p>Was anyone from Human Resources arrested?</p>
<p>Was anyone from Senior Management arrested?</p>
<p>Was anyone at the Director/Executive level arrested?</p>
<p>Too much is done with a wink and a nod, but only the person at the bottom of the food chain is &hellip;.. hmm.. caught and made a public display.</p>
<p><br>
When will we as White Americans stop beating up ONLY the little people and deal with the root problem: The Ruling Elite?</p>
<p>Yes the illegals should be rounded up, given a few days to take care of personal things, say good bye to family, (We are not Monsters.) and then sent back home.</p>
<p>THEN, then the minutes of all HR meetings and Senior Level meetings should be reviewed for just one hint that lower level staff was encourged to break or look over the legal status of employees. </p>
<p>THEN, we should review all the emails and correspondence from various government agencies when the SS number and names did not match up to examine exactly how this company covered up and continued their employment of illegals. </p>
<p>THEN, we prosecute the Senior Level and above managers for aiding the evasion and breakin of federal laws.</p>
<p>THEN, The Ruling Elite will stop breaking the law and trying to undermind and destroy those who are ruled.</p>

			<p>When&rsquo;s the last time we heard of one of these raids taking place? About a month ago, down in Mississippi.</p>
<p>We have over 12 million illegal aliens in this country. If the government were serious, there&rsquo;d be raids like these happening several times a day, not once every month or so.</p>

			<p>Corporations have special legal protection under the law,individuals often do not. Because of the corporate veil, its probable nothing will happen to those in Human Resources responsible for hiring these illegals. South Carolina must get rid of all those South of the Border billboards. I think the illegals interpret this as a personal invite.</p>

			<p>Any sob stories about breast feeding babies ripped from their Mother&rsquo;s arms yet???</p>
<p>In S. California whenever there is a raid the television news always manages to find these babies and makes a big sob story about the abandoned babies and toddlers.</p>
<p>And then comes the comment from Mr. and MS Hairspray. &#8220;Something must be done to reform immigration.&#8221;  Immigration reform in S. California means tear down the border and bring every Mexican to California.</p>

<p>Just like Southern California&hellip;  except here, they love parks.  The San Fernando Valley has some great public parks, which are now overrun by drunk Mexicans and their ill-behaved children.  They park their Suburbans and mini-vans right on the lawn, litter, well&hellip;  all you AmReners know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>

			<p>With all the warnings they have had about similar raids at other businesses, one would think the illegals would be bright enough to either pack up and go home, or make some contingency plans if they&rsquo;re rounded up.</p>
<p>I mean wouldn&rsquo;t even Forest Gump know better?</p>
