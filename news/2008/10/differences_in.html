<h1>Differences in Mortality Rates Based on Race</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Admin, Pokerallied.com, October 26, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of researcher from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Baltimore report that Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to die in U.S. emergency rooms after a trauma than white patients are. They found that 8.2 percent of blacks and 9.1 percent of Hispanics died in U.S. emergency rooms, compared with 5.7 percent of whites. In addition, 8.6 percent of uninsured patients died compared with 4.4 percent of insured patients.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Compared with an insured white patient, equivalently injured black patients have 20 percent higher risk of dying, while Hispanic patients have a 51 percent increased odds of dying, Haider said. This problem is even worse for the uninsured {snip}.</p>
<p>This is the first large study that identifies differences in mortality rates based on race following trauma of all types. In this study both race and insurance status independently predicted mortality following trauma. The absence of health insurance increased a trauma patient&rsquo;s adjusted odds of death by almost 50%. Of the insured patients, both Hispanic and African American patients had significantly higher odds of mortality compared with white patients. This confirms that racial disparities in trauma mortality cannot be completely explained by insurance status alone.</p>
<p>This study involved a retrospective analysis of trauma patients entered in the National Trauma Data Bank, version 6.1, between 2001 and 2005. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Access to trauma care is near universal in the United States, so these dramatic differences in patients with and without insurance are unexpected, Haider said. &#8220;The study also shows that there are racial disparities in survival after trauma, and differences in insurance between whites and minorities that cannot explain away these disparities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now that we know this, we can go about understanding exactly why these disparities exist and try to come up with solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both race and insurance status independently influenced mortality after moderate to severe trauma in adults aged 18 to 64 years. This study refutes the notion that racial disparities are merely a reflection of insurance status differences. {snip}</p>

			<p>Blacks and Hispanics are far more likely to be in emergency rooms than Whites, first of all.  The reasons for this are obvious.  More:<br>
Fights, assaults, attempted murders, drug overdoses, car accidents (and the car accidents are usually more traumatic) coupled with bodies that are usually less healthy because of lifelong abuse with drugs, alcohol, promiscuous sex, poor eating habits, obesity, etc.   <br>
Obviously the mortality rates are going to be higher too.  But whose fault is it? - You guessed it - the evil White man.</p>

			<p>Does it occur to anybody that there might be substantial racial differences in the types and frequency of injury trauma centers see and that these might totally explain this observation? For example, would one expect the number of gunshot or stab wounds to be greater or lesser among violence-prone blacks and Mexicans than for Euro whites? What about the severity of accidents? Violence is what happens when one runs out of good ideas and certain racial groups run out 0f ideas sooner and more consistently than others. Accidents happens more frequently to those with short attention spans than to conscientious individuals (and groups thereof.) Richard Lynn has written a paper on the pathological nature of blacks&rsquo; personalities. Could this be a factor, do you suppose?<br>
There exists substantial evidence in the academic literature (see U. Del Prof. Linda Gottfredson&rsquo;s publications available on her homepage) that low IQ people tend to have dramatically higher frequencies of accidents and fatal injuries, and that racial disparities in IQ explain a huge fraction of health disparities and mortality risk. This is all a logical extension of Bell Curve consequences regarding life outcomes for people and groups of low genetic intelligence and is easily available in on-line archives to anybody who has the interest to pursue such questions.</p>

			<p>Why is this a surprise? Most trauma, when not the result of an automobile accident, is a result of violence. This year, I am sure, more blacks will go to emergency with gunshot wounds than<br>
US forces injured in Iraq. $1000 to anyone who proves me wrong.<br>

			<p>A non-work-related, non-automobile accident trauma injury for a suburban white is likely to be the result of some sort of accident at home, such as a slip-and-fall (I gave myself quite a concussion back in 2005, falling off a ladder and doing a face-plant on the garage floor).  These simple injuries are less likely to be fatal than the gunshot wounds, baseball bat-beating injuries, and the stabbings urban blacks and Hispanics so commonly inflict on each other.</p>
<p>Most of these differences can be attributed to the usual behavioral differences.  Simply staying home in the evenings greatly reduces the likelihood of one&rsquo;s suffering a trauma injury in the first place.  As another poster said last week, an entirely different group of people come out at night.  If you want to drink in the evenings, do it at home.  A young fellow in one of my classes got robbed last summer.  When I asked him what he was doing at the time, he said he was &#8220;hanging out in the park at midnight&#8221;.  I asked him why he thought that had seemed like a good idea.  He had no good answer.</p>

			<p>I think this may be as much a result of what happens to hospitals when a majority black population moves in as it is blacks &amp; hispanic violence. More show up to hospitals without insurance, profits decrease, it becomes more difficult to retain staff (not just because of wages, but also because of the dislike of having to treat so many blacks &amp; hispanics due to their hostile attitudes). The best trained &amp; qualified doctors, nurses, EMTs are not going to want to work at that hospital. In trauma cases they make you go to the closest hospital unless you have insurance, and even then with severe enough trauma you don&rsquo;t have a choice. So where do you think blacks end up? </p>
<p>The other factor is probably time. The more blacks and hispanics, the more likely hospitals will close. A few of them close, and the ride to a trauma center becomes several minutes longer. Those minutes matter. I&rsquo;ve witnessed the closing of 3 hospitals in my area since it became nearly 50% minority.  There is nothing worse than going to the one remaining hospital at 3am and dealing with the unruly blacks there, especially on a weekend.  Where else are they going to go? Uninsured drove the others out of business. </p>

			<p>Correct, Salt, and with a smaller number of hospitals in an area, the wait at the emergency room will be longer.  I was badly beaten in Sydney by Serbian muggers who didn&rsquo;t like the Croatian insignea on my camoflauge jacket back in 1998.  I went to the hospital in Randwick the next evening to have my hand looked at, which was swollen to over twice its size and very stiff (it had done a fine job inflicting a variant of continental drift on one attacker&rsquo;s facial features), only to discover that a sort of triage was in effect, due to the injuries resulting from a riot at a soccer game.  After waiting three hours, I gave up and walked back home.  The swelling was gone in about three months, but ten years later, that hand is still a bit stiff.  I probably had a fracture of some sort in it.</p>
<p>As you said, those minutes matter.</p>
