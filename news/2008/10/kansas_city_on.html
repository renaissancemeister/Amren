<h1>Kansas City on Track for Record Killing Season</h1>
									<div align="left">
						<i>AP, Oct. 16, 2008</i></font> 
					</div>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Killings in Kansas City are happening at an alarming rate, and police and residents say the slayings can be traced to the same urban maladies that have plagued the city for years.</p>
<p>Two more suspected homicides were reported Thursday morning, bringing the yearly toll to 105, and officials say 2008 could wind up as the deadliest year in Kansas City since the 1990s. There were 21 homicides in August alone &mdash; a record for a single month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the killings are happening on the city&rsquo;s economically and academically troubled east side. Residents forced to cope with joblessness and failed schools are increasingly resorting to desperate measures, police say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what former police officer and Mayor Pro Tem Alvin Brooks thinks happened to a teenager he was mentoring, 18-year-old Vincent Williams, whose September 23 shooting death pushed the city&rsquo;s yearly toll to 100.</p>
<p>Williams had dropped out of high school and couldn&rsquo;t read, write or do math. But he had proven to be a hard worker mowing yards. Brooks, a longtime community activist, had spoken to the teen about a lead on a job six days before he was killed.</p>
<p>Police say Williams tried to rob a convenience store at gunpoint and was killed by a clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here was a kid who tried so hard,&rdquo; Brooks said. &ldquo;I believe he just gave up hope and went to the extreme for survival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vincent didn&rsquo;t fail himself. We failed him, the system failed him. There are a lot of Vincent Williamses out there in urban America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than half of the homicide victims &mdash; about 70 &mdash; have been black males.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe if we had more jobs, we wouldn&rsquo;t have this shooting and killing,&rdquo; said Opal King, who helps lead a Caring Community group on the east side that assists families with employment, housing and education. &ldquo;It seems like everything is falling on these black males 17 and up.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, in New Orleans, homicides are sky high.  In Nairobi, Kenya, homicides are sky high.  In Detroit, MI, homicides are sky high.  In Haiti, homicides are sky high.  In Cleavland, OH homicides are sky high. In Zimbabwe, homicides are sky high. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, homicides are sky high. In Abuja, Nigeria, homicides are sky high&hellip; . Any place in the World that Africans gather, homicides are sky high, and it is always because Whites have failed them.  Silly, childish people.</p>

			<p>This kid dropped out of high school because, among other failings, he couldn&rsquo;t read?  After perhaps ten years in the school system?</p>
<p>This kind of story just leaves any sane reader shaking his head and wondering what sort of value system thinks society is to blame, when after trying to provide a free education, probably welfare payments and other means of free support for a black youth, that &#8220;we&#8221; failed him.</p>
<p>How about the black culture and typically fatherless family failed him?</p>

			<p>Unbelievable. This black had somebody networking a job for him, and he STILL tried to commit a crime. So much for the lie that, if only blacks had job opportunities, they wouldn&rsquo;t be out committing these crimes, and everything would be hunky-dory.</p>
<p>This black failed himself. Nobody else could go to school for him, take his classes, and do his reading, writing, studying and THINKING for him. And yet, his fellow blacks say, his &#8220;massa&#8221; Uncle Sam, failed him.</p>
<p>WRONG! That kind of guilt trip they used to try to book passage for whitey on, won&rsquo;t do anymore. This abject refusal to take personal responsibility for their own actions is one reason why blacks are the way they are, regardless of where they live. </p>

			<p>                 70% of the homicide victims in Kansas City were black!85% of the homicide victims in Oakland were black! 65% of the homicide victims in San Francisco were black!Why doesnt the media ever say what % of the perpetrators of these acts are?Would all of the percentages be higher than that of the % of the victims that were black? </p>

&#8220;Residents forced to cope with joblessness and failed schools are increasingly resorting to desperate measures, police say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Williams had dropped out of high school and couldn&rsquo;t read, write or do math.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a consequence of the actions of the corrupt legal/political system during the latter half of the 20th century, the Government school industry has a lot to answer for. Did it ever occur to these social planning theorists, though,  that perhaps there are also failed &#8220;Black&#8221; students who are independent of the failed dastardly and destructive attempts to integrate the schools? </p>
<p>How did Williams get into &#8220;High School&#8221; without being able to read, write, or do simple arithmetic?</p>

			<p>Of course &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;the system&#8221; are always mean &#8220;white&#8221; (code words, ya know).  <br>
Talk about the white man&rsquo;s burden!  You can never do enough to make up for black failure.<br>
We have given, and given, and given and it has borne no fruit.<br>

			<p>It will only take a few short decades before their own behavior wipes them out.  Then the US will, at long last, be free of them.</p>
<p>The cost is decidely high.  But, it&rsquo;s just punishment for the evil of tolerating liberalism.</p>
<p>With the coming collapse of what is left of russia and the shrinking and final disappearance of blacks from our society, the reasons for liberalism to exist will have rotted away from the inside.</p>
<p>A shameful resolution to our problems.  But a solution, nonetheless.  Proof that, if you ignore a problem long enough, it goes away on its own.</p>

			<p>We failed him? Society failed him? Dangerous words, indeed. These &#8220;mentors&#8221; are the worst kind of people. To deny a person the responsibility and consequences of their actions, is to sell them short (and to treat as a lesser). If society is &#8220;failing&#8221; anyone, it is through the work ethic - robbing mechanism of the welfare state. When people are responsible for their own income (and actions in general), they tend to live more responsibly (and procreate accordingly). </p>

<p>No, no, no.  </p>
<p>Not going to school doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;fall&#8221; on you; you choose not to go.<br>
Not studying your lessons doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;fall&#8221; on you; you choose to hang out and shoot hoops rather than read and study.<br>
Getting you a  &mdash;   shot to death during an armed robbery doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;fall&#8221; on you; you choose to be an armed and violent thug.</p>
<p>As long as blacks keep singing that same old &#8220;po&rsquo; black me&#8221; song and blaming everyone else for their failures, they will continue to be the wretched of the earth.</p>

Sounds to me like vincent DID fail himself. Basic high school education was too much trouble for him to bother with, so he resorted to menial jobs, then armed robbery.<br>
Hope this sends the right message to the right people, but of course, it will largely be considered that &#8220;the system failed him&#8221;, just like the liberal idiot Alvin Brooks who made the statement.<br>

			<p>how many of us here think that young Vincent would have held that &#8216;job&rsquo; any more than a week had he gotten it? chances are he&rsquo;d been stealing for years. this time his attempt to take &#8216;a shortcut&rsquo; failed.</p>

Is this Kansas City or Buffalo they&rsquo;re describing? Same tired old excuses. &#8216;It&rsquo;s not them, it&rsquo;s us&rsquo;, &#8216;we didn&rsquo;t try hard enough&rsquo;, &#8216;we failed them&rsquo;, and on and on.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not me, it&rsquo;s them. I don&rsquo;t need to try harder, they do. I didn&rsquo;t fail them, they failed themselves.</p>
<p>Different city, same excuses because black behavior is universal. A nation in Africa or a neighborhood in America. There&rsquo;s no difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how when you leave white people alone they thrive. When you leave blacks alone, they destroy themselves. For me, there&rsquo;s no clearer evidence of race than that.</p>

			<p>No, young black males ages 17 and up are failing us, not the other way around. I&rsquo;m sick of the excuse making, everywhere blacks congregate in large numbers, violence, murder, and mayhem soon follow.  Black males make up about 5% of the population and commit about 60% of all violent crime. We can&rsquo;t lock these guys up fast enough.</p>

<p>Only a complete, utter idiot would conclude that somebody but the individual is responsible for his own criminal actions.</p>
<p>And the reason we hear so much of this kind of nonsense from the black community is because they have an abundance of complete, utter idiots.  Their only other alternative is to tell the truth, that blacks pull way too many crimes, but they won&rsquo;t do that, because they&rsquo;ve had too much success playing the victim.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Young black men killing each other because &ldquo;we&rdquo; failed them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and as the financial crisis worsens and it takes job skills or an education to secure employment, we will be failing black males even more all over the country, because their incarceration figures will steadily grow.</p>
<p>The governments in every state should prepare for this by building more prisons, and better-looking ones, with game rooms, Gyms and lunch rooms.  The cosmetics should be top notch too, so that when they get parolled they will be able to look their families in the eye and tell them they&rsquo;re proud to be graduates of such a fine institution.  Taking pride in one&rsquo;s accomplishments means an awful lot.</p>

			<p>St. Louis is heading for a record homicide tally for this decade, as well.</p>
<p>KC Mayor Mark Funkhouser is referenced in a similar Kansas City Star story.  F-Houser was in the news earlier this year when he proposed that even those with adult felony convictions should be allowed to become KC cops.  Of course, since he&rsquo;s a lawyer, he knows that this is an impossible proposition, but I think he was engaging in a bait-and-switch:  He knows that letting adult felons be cops is illegal, and thus undoable.  But he also knows what he really wants, that is, eliminating testing requirements for minority applicants, would also be laughed off the stage.  So the bait-and-switch is to propose seriously the first option, to get everyone outraged and in a mood to &#8220;negotiate&#8221; down to the second option.</p>
<p>Remember, for more than a decade, Mr.Williams&rsquo;s school system, the KCPS, were adorned with billions of dollars to make themselves more attractive for suburban whites and presumably better for the resident blacks.  See how well it worked, that a functionally illiterate groundskeeper should rob a store?</p>

			<p>   After untold trillions of dollars of taxpayer money being wasted on LBJ&rsquo;s foolish great society; &#8220;we&#8221; have failed &#8220;them&#8221;. This is totally unbelieveable. Actually, the bigger question is, how far could society itself have advanced if the money was put to good use? Had the money been used for medical research, energy research, etc&hellip;  It could have been a great society for everybody instead of pandering to self-righteous,selfish, ungrateful blacks and hispanics, and minorities in general.</p>

			<p>     With a few tweaks to this story, this could also be Indianapolis. After Judge Dillin decided that the Indianapolis Public Schools were unconstitutional, by God the busing began in earnest to the township schools. Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana are almost one and the same and the east side is becoming a third world county. </p>
<p>      I&rsquo;m sure the clerk who defended himself against an armed robbery also failed Vincent Williams. On his minimum wage job, he wasn&rsquo;t doing enough to support the Taj Mahal schools that were ordered by Judge Clark.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;This black had somebody networking a job for him, and he STILL tried to commit a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I was a Probation Officer I sent one of the black thugs off to some federal job program in the federal building.  He was some sort of clerk&rsquo;s assistant.  This was before direct deposit. His 3rd day on the job happened to be payday.  His supervisor sent him down to the payroll office to pick up the paychecks for the department.</p>
<p>He never came back.  He took one look at the bundle of checks and took off to the nearest currency exchange and tried to cash the checks.  The currency exchange hit the silent alarm for  the police and he was arrested then and there.</p>
<p>And it was a federal crime.  The secret service sent him to federal prison.</p>
<p>Another thug got some reform the criminals job with the parks department.  He missed an appointment with me one morning.  Late that afternoon I got a jail booking slip.  While waiting for the bus to come to my office he noticed an elderly lady and her purse.  So he snatched the purse and ran off.  Thank God for cell phones.  A passerby called 911 with his description and he was caught a few blocks away.</p>
<p>Thugs with IQs of 70 do not make criminal geniuses.</p>
<p>So many black government employees have criminal records.  Government agencies recruit them right out of the prisons and parole offices.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Urban maladies&#8221; are NOT the problem. The PROBLEM is black males. If these blacks were all living in rural North Dakota the writer would be undoubtedly referring to &#8220;rural malaise&#8221; as the problem since the problem would STILL be there.</p>

			<p>Those poor police officers who must go through Diversity Training and told to judge everyone equally.</p>
<p>Most of which joined the force to STOP crime, now they&rsquo;re being told that whites perform 50% of crime, blacks do 50% of crimes, Asians perform 50% of crimes, Native Americans do 50% of crimes and the rest in this nauseating mixture that is so minute no statistics reporter would ever care to acknowledge, officers are now taught 50% + 50% + 50% + 50% +50% makes liberal common sense.</p>
<p>Black police officers know that most crimes committed are by blacks, but no one calls them racist for saying so, they&rsquo;re just called &#8220;cops&#8221; in an insulting manner.</p>

			<p>There was a story in the Washington Post a couple days ago.  Same old same old.  Black crime is rising.  Black thugs are invading White neighborhoods.  There has been a substantial increase in black violence in the last few years.</p>
<p>The Post of course justifies the increase in crime to black anxiety about gentrification and Whites moving into their neighborhoods.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Vincent didn&rsquo;t fail himself. We failed him, the system failed him. There are a lot of Vincent Williamses out there in urban America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe if we had more jobs, we wouldn&rsquo;t have this shooting and killing,&#8221; said Opal King, who helps lead a Caring Community group on the east side that assists families with employment, housing and education. &#8220;It seems like everything is falling on these black males 17 and up.&#8221;</p>
<p>What an unbelievable lack of moral ethos and outright rejection of personal responsibility this woman, Opal, conveys with her comments. She is literally justifying rampant and senseless murders because of the lack of jobs. Funny how I don&rsquo;t recall hearing or reading about rampant, uncontrolled, senseless murders happening during the Great Depression of the 1930&rsquo;s when jobs were far more scarce and the people seeking them were far more qualified, unlike Vincent Williams who &#8220;&hellip;dropped out of high school and couldn&rsquo;t read, write or do math&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is HE that dropped out of high school and it is HE that should suffer the consequences of it. In this case, the consequence of not being able to find a &#8220;good&#8221; job. I doubt that anybody put a gun to his head and FORCED him to drop out of high school. But, of course, this is the mindset of most urban blacks&hellip;that they are OWED a good job and a good life without having to put the effort in to achieve it.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a 20/20 episode several years ago where Diane Sawyer was interviewing a group of high school drop-out black gangbangers from LA and she asked them why they didn&rsquo;t get a job at McDonald&rsquo;s and work their way up the ladder. They laughed at this suggestion, saying that a job at McDonald&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t good enough for them. They were all drop-outs, mind you. Just another example from countless examples of blacks wanting something handed to them without ever having to do anything to get it.<br>

<p>Stop, stop!!!! I can&rsquo;t bear to hear anymore. I need to get my hanky out to wipe away the tears. NOT. Face it, &#8220;poor young Vincent&#8221; was a useless thug. He robbed because he wanted easy money and he didn&rsquo;t want to have to work for. He didn&rsquo;t want to learn to read or get an education, he didn&rsquo;t want to try to do anything with his life and he didn&rsquo;t care. Unfortunately for Vincent, he robbed the wrong person and got shot and killed. Oh well, at least Vincent won&rsquo;t be around to attack others and the taxpayers will sure save a lot in prison cost. </p>

			<p>And this is supposed to be surprising news?  But once again whites are to blame.  Never blame blacks for their own choices and failings.  But wait, aren&rsquo;t more blacks in charge of cities, government handouts and services.  So who has failed who.</p>
<p>This is just another lame pitiful excuse to blame whitey.</p>
<p>My definition is blacks cannot govern themselves accordingly and they can cast blame all they want and not a politician in this country has the guts to address the real problems that are happening all over this country and elsewhere in the world.  And it doesn&rsquo;t take a brain surgery to figure it out.  Everybody knows what the problem is.  Blacks haven&rsquo;t been able to pull themselves up even with all the help and assistance they&rsquo;ve gotten for the past 50 years. </p>

<p>But not to worry, the black messiah will soon be elected and then society will no longer fail these young black men.  Hope is dope.<br>

			<p>Back in 82, I saw in the local Atlanta rag that a white guy I&rsquo;d known in 7th and 8th grade (about 10 yrs. earlier) had been shot and killed while he was attempting to hold up a nearby movie theater at gunpoint. The manager or whoever shot him was not charged, as it was certainly justifiable homicide. My former schoolmate had been a troublemaker when we were 12-13, as had his twin sister. I still was a bit shocked that he had met such a violent end, but I did not claim society had failed him. At 23, he knew it was wrong to commit armed robbery. I regret that he died as he did, but his would-be victim had no choice. The same applies to the above-mentioned incident. Would he agree if I said blacks are responsible for the actions of my ex-schoolmate?</p>

			<p>The Kansas City Star ran a feature article concerning the 21 homicide victims in Kansas City, Missouri during August.  20 victims were black.  1 victim was Hispanic.  </p>
<p>As a victim of public schools integrated by forced bussing, I knew dozens of Vincent Williams.  Their problem in school was they never put forth much if any effort to learn.  The system did not fail them.  They failed themselves.</p>
<p>Albert Brooks has led countless marches against murder in the ghetto, crime in the ghetto, etc over the past two decades. The marches get the same results.  Nothing.</p>

			<p>The white suicide rate is higher than the blcak suicide rate.  This proves a few things.</p>
<p>1) People care about bad things happening to blacks and don&rsquo;t care about bad things happening to whites</p>
<p>2) More on topic.  Odds are that blacks aren&rsquo;t commiting more crimes due to &#8220;depression caused by their struggles against racism.&#8221;  Seemingly, they are less depressed than whites are.</p>

			<p>he Government school industry has a lot to answer for&hellip;<br>
How did Williams get into &#8216;High School&rsquo; without being able to read, write, or do simple arithmetic?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ronald</p>
<p>Ronald:</p>
<p>The government school industry undoubtedly has a lot to answer for. Trying to educate those with IQs of 85 past a rudimentary level is simply Not Possible  &mdash;  and everything that has been tried (and tried repeatedly, at tremendous cost) has failed miserably. Until the government accepts this intractable reality for what it is, as Charles Murray points out so clearly in his new book &#8216;Real Education&rsquo; NOTHING will change. Money and specious theories spouted from ivory towers will not change this.</p>
<p>The schools will continue to turn out Williams-type students, a lot of them, blaming society, White racism, lack of money (as always), economic disparity, poverty as the &#8216;root cause.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With the ingrained system as it is, students such as Williams (who got what he ultimately deserved) will be passed along because no one is sure exactly what to do with them as they get older.  If Williams is held back, his size alone makes him dangerous to the smaller children (I&rsquo;ve seen this tried and quickly abandoned as Williams-types threaten and extort money from the smaller kids), for that reason alone, he must be passed on to the next school  &mdash;  which is unsure of what to do with a large, angry black male who cannot read, write or compute.  This is what makes inner-city such utter hells.</p>
<p>How exactly and to what extent should the government attempt to educate those with IQs of 85 (or lower)?  Specious educational theories state emphatically that &#8216;we are all the same&rsquo; there are NO IQ differences, and that ANYONE and EVERYONE is capable of mastering applied mathematics and theoretical physics  &mdash;  and if they don&rsquo;t it is the fault of the racist White system.</p>
<p>So what does Williams and others of his ilk with IQs of 85 do when they hit the so-called ceiling  &mdash;  when their low IQs have taken them as far as they&rsquo;re going to go, about a third-grade level? No wonder they&rsquo;re so angry!  They&rsquo;ve been informed repeatedly that &#8216;anything they can dream, they can achieve&rsquo;.  It can&rsquo;t possibly be their fault. They&rsquo;re told constantly they&rsquo;re going to Harvard, MIT, Princeton  &mdash;  because dreaming of going there and being told they&rsquo;re going there will make it possible.  Hard work, focus, intelligence, competition, drive and sacrifice are never included, of course (not that this is possible for low functioning groups to carry out).</p>
<p>Years of spotty attendance, repeated failure, and inability to comprehend the school curriculum finally lead Williams-types to drop out (and he SHOULD drop out) and begin his life of crime.  He knows (and has LOTS of support) that no matter what he does it will be the schools&rsquo; fault, or society&rsquo;s fault, or the fault of White racism, never his fault.</p>
<p>The solution?  Build more prisons, arm yourself, as did the clerk in the convenience store, to protect yourself and your property against Williams-types, and require IUDs for anyone receiving welfare, including AFCD, TANF, Section 8 and any other government handouts.  It will take a lot of force, government force, to achieve this, and in the current political climate, will not be possible.  Perhaps a total economic collapse (including a lot of violence) will have to take place before any sanity is restored to this country.</p>
<p>As of now, the government-run educational complex is too entrenched in its false beliefs and is therefore hopeless.</p>

			<p>A lot of these Black males are half-way decent when talking to them one-on-one, but they turn absolutely feral when left to their own and their is no end to the mayhem they produce when &#8220;Wilding&#8221; or just &#8220;Hangin&rsquo; Out&#8221;.  I have witnessed their behavior for years, as a student and as a substitute.  The majority are simply incorrigible.  To blame Whites for their recalcitrant behavior is a  practice in insanity&hellip;. Trickle-down insanity from the ivory towers of social engineers.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We&#8221; didn&rsquo;t fail them, because no part of any individual&rsquo;s behavior is anyone&rsquo;s responsibility but their own.  I bear absolutely no responsibility for this dead thug&rsquo;s decision to not study in school, his decision to drop out, his difficulty competing for wages with the illegal aliens who usually work for landscaping companies, and his decision to try to rob an armed storekeeper at gunpoint.  Williams spent his entire short life making stupid decisions, and other posters have written here in the past, &#8220;you can&rsquo;t fix stupid&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Nice shooting on that store clerk&rsquo;s part!  Taking a violent goon out of circulation before he could seriously hurt someone is a community service, and we will fortunately not be hearing a decade from now how Williams abducted, raped and murdered a pretty college co-ed.</p>

<p>But&hellip;.</p>
<p>There ARE middle-class blacks who are law-abiding and successful.</p>
<p>There ARE whites who are lazy shiftless bums.  (The term I&rsquo;ve heard is &#8220;white trash&#8221;.)</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;re seeing here is the result of CULTURE, not of race.  (Of &#8220;how to be and act in the world&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;genetic tendency to be stupid and criminal&#8221;.)  There may be some measurable differences of &#8220;average abilities&#8221; between races; I&rsquo;ve seen the statistics that that rank Asians above Europeans above Africans.   So, OK, there&rsquo;s possibly a racial difference in the equipment you get when you&rsquo;re born.  </p>
<p>But I think the real difference comes down to the Western culture that Christianity created: the belief that you&rsquo;re born in sin, you&rsquo;re always tempted to sin, and you must struggle to take the high path.  You fail, all people fail, but that&rsquo;s not an excuse.  You have to start over again and do better; you have to take responsibility for yourself and your actions and the results of your actions.  There is a concept of &#8220;right&#8221; and &#8220;wrong&#8221; in our culture (not just &#8220;what I think I can get away with&#8221;).  There is a concept of &#8220;what I owe to the world, to God, to my fellow man&#8221; (not just &#8220;what I think the world owes me&#8221;).  There is a belief in punishment and reward not just for the misdeeds that others can see, but also for the &#8220;hidden sins&#8221; of the heart; the Christian culture attempts to discourage envy, resentment, and a sense of entitlement.  And all the &#8220;thou shalt not&#8221;s: lying, cheating, coveting, stealing, lusting after your neighbor&rsquo;s wife, etc.  Humans follow the commandments imperfectly, of course, but the ideal infuses every aspect of law and life; it&rsquo;s there in all the agreements and mutual expectations that our &#8220;social compact&#8221; is founded on.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m left to wonder if these poor urban black kids who kill each other over nothing-much-at-all have ever had any exposure to Christian values&hellip;  Or do they hear only the hateful Black Liberation Theology garbage: &#8220;The white man keeps the black man down&#8221;, &#8220;the only God I worship is one who destroys the whites&#8221;.  Those beliefs, that culture, denies the Western belief of man created by God in His image.  It denies the spark of divinity in each of us.  It denies the possibility of transcendence, of deliverance, of victory.  It chains them to the belief that they&rsquo;re eternal victims instead of beloved children of the Eternal God.  They are left with no belief in a glorious soul that transcends life and circumstance, so they sit in squalor and chase temporal pleasures and destroy themselves.</p>
<p>As I said, I see it as a failed culture (  &mdash;  a culture of failure?  &mdash;  ) rather than a necessary consequence of race.  The problem is, I don&rsquo;t know how to persuade somebody, or some group,  that what they&rsquo;re doing is stupid and self-destructive.  Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and Jeremiah Wright perpetuate the problem rather than doing anything to solve it.  (Of course, if black-failed-society ever got fixed, the race-grievance-mongers would have no jobs and no money.  Big disincentive there.) </p>

			<p>In my state, everything is supplied at public schools: paper, pencils and other writing materials, notebooks, calculators and on and on.  That&rsquo;s, &#8220;everything&#8221;, by law.  </p>
<p>Back in the 70&rsquo;s, black &#8220;movements&#8221; and activists demanded and received money from the public purse to pour into schools in their communities. &#8220;Neglect and racism&#8221;, they said, was the cause of poor black student performance. If they wanted whatever from the state, they got it, no matter how ridiculous. They whined that black parents couldn&rsquo;t afford even the basics so our state legislature passed a law that everything would be provided for the student without cost to them.</p>
<p>Need a ride to school?  They get one, to and from home,with buses running routes even if there are only 3 kids to pick up on the route. This is common in Detroit.    </p>
<p>All machines and hi-tech equipment is provide, and kept up to date with new purchases as the technology evolves.  </p>
<p>To complete this insane system, a student&rsquo;s parent could apply for and get, with very little proof of need, breakfast and lunch for their child, paid for by the taxpayer.  </p>
<p>The above being said, all the kid has to do is show up, sit down, shut up, and learn.  It can&rsquo;t get any easier than that. </p>
<p>Now look at the stats in black communities:</p>
<p>Detroit:  25% high school graduation rate.</p>
<p>Flint, Benton Harbor, Pontiac, black school districts all: under 45% high school graduation rates.  Benton Harbor&rsquo;s grad rate is around 30%.</p>
<p>All personal responsibility for an education has been removed from blacks here in Michigan, and their continuing failure is still considered the fault of the government.  Blacks here still whine, demand, and always get, more money from the state for &#8220;new programs&#8221;, and &#8220;new, afro-centered&#8221; teaching methods that are touted as sure bets to get blacks to appreciate an education. </p>
<p>When the money arrives, raises are immediately given to everyone in their public ed system.  A Detroit public school teacher with 5 years of experience can easily earn 80 grand per year. A school principal, 110 grand (and more). </p>
<p>You can point out the obvious in regard to blacks rejecting education wholesale, but the same premise for their failure is still considered valid; it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s fault and more money from the government is the only &#8220;cure&#8221;.         </p>

<p>Sorry, nothing doing there.</p>
<p>Someone I know provided me an analogy that debunks this scenario.</p>
<p>Imagine that there were only 10 people on Earth.  Nine were men, and one was a woman.  In that scenario, there could only be one new human being every nine months.  Now, reverse the scenario:  One man and nine women.  In that case, there could be nine new human beings every nine months.  </p>
<p>In order to have a rapid population crash, women need to be affected.  Black crime involving homicides is almost always black boy and man - on - black boy and man.  There would need to be a severe and unprecedented pandemic of violence where black women are the victims in order to crash the black population.  If that hasn&rsquo;t happened now in today&rsquo;s climate, it never will.  Ergo, the black population is going to continue to rise, ceteris paribus.</p>

			<p>its true the &#8220;system&#8221; is the same for black kids and other kids, either white or asian. yet when the latter become educated, do well and make something of themselves is it not the same system producing these kids? so for those who wring their collective hands and bemoan a system that fails black kids what about the other kids? In the black community, to learn and study hard is to be &#8220;too white&#8221;. They set themselves up for their own failures and yet are too stupid to see who is really the problem. </p>

<p>Idiotic politicians have already been doing that, Opal, and that, for decades.</p>
<p>Keep voting Democrat and those jobs will get farther and farther away. Then again, most blacks don&rsquo;t learn from history, and as this article validates, most don&rsquo;t seem to learn much of anything. </p>

			<p>The only way this country can survive without erupting eventually into civil warfare that will tear it apart is by recognizing the fact that blacks are less intelligent than the rest of the population, they are more prone to crime and violence, they lack creativity, ingenuity, inventiveness, and every other quality it takes to contribute to the advancement of a first world civilization, and accept all these negatives as actual fact, then work toward finding a solution.</p>
<p>Pretending that blacks are just like everybody else when every other race on earth could fit into a first world society but blacks is an outrageous lie that is causing problems that are extremely severe.   </p>

			<p>What do you think of this idea:  if our public schools gave each student emotional and I.Q. tests at about age 10 (fifth grade)?  With that each student would then be assigned to a class of similar students for the duration of his public schooling, with the classifications being 1) mentally retarded; 2) slow learners; 3) any type of student with excessively aggressive, antisocial tendencies; 4) average students; and 5) advanced students.    </p>
<p>This way the faster learners would not be slowed down by the slower, and the aggressive, antisocial students would be kept from bullying the others and disrupting classes.  &#8220;Each at his own pace&#8221; could be the motto, rather than &#8220;No child left behind,&#8221; which isn&rsquo;t working.  </p>
<p>The antisocial ones could receive intense counseling after class.  Their teachers during class could be tough drill sergeant types to keep order.  </p>
<p>If any of the students really apply themselves and excel, they could be retested and promoted to the new applicable class.</p>
<p>The main problem is that the aggressive students are destroying the learning experience for all others.  The whole school atmosphere becomes coarser because of the thugs.  If the thugs make up just 15% of the school population they create a lot of misery for everybody.</p>
<p>Do any of you teachers like this proposal or think that it might be of benefit?  Or would it just be prohibitively expensive?  Thanks for any input you may give!</p>

<p>I never claimed that all whites were perfect and intelligent. I believe stereotypes exist because they&rsquo;re true which is why we have the stereotype of white trash.</p>
<p>It comes down to this: Race first, culture follows. That&rsquo;s why when we lived in a segregated society and blacks were largely expect to live by white standards they did better. But when that influence was removed and they were free to follow the drives of their own race and establish their own cultural norms, they imploded.</p>
<p>Can we go back to imposing our culture on them? It works to some degree but they resent us for making them &#8216;act white&rsquo; by asking them to confirm to our cultural norms.</p>

			<p>Should Barack Obama win the presidential election, it&rsquo;s expected that he&rsquo;ll favor redistributing wealth by spending even more tax dollars on the failing legacy of sending money to the so-called needy. Although this practice has proven to be ineffective for decades, Obama&rsquo;s constituent&rsquo;s will expect it. I believe we need just the opposite. We need an administration that will stand up and call a spade a spade (pun intended). Blacks need to assume responsibility for their own actions and &#8216;we&rsquo; as a society, unafraid of worn out labels like racists, should hold blacks accountable for their own failings and make it clear to our society that it&rsquo;s a problem within a specific group of people; black males. I&rsquo;m tired of politicians cowering away from stating the truth about a situation in American society that will not end if our government and media will not address it directly. By being afraid of offending a small, specific group of sub-human waste, they continue to perpetuate the burdon that the rest of society has to bear.  </p>

We also know that it&rsquo;s because of idiots like you that make excuses for them, that they ARE out there and will ALWAYS be out there. I have crossed paths with many Vincent Williams in my day and, because of the &#8220;fond&#8221; memories I have of them, I will NEVER vote for ANY black for ANY position at ANY time! The Vincent Williams of the world WILL cross my mind as I go to the polls and vote John McCain. I wasn&rsquo;t always like this, it was the Vincent Williams in my life that brought me to this point. So I guess you could say that it&rsquo;s Vincent Williams that failed ME!!!</p>

<p>African pathology exists wherever Africans exist. If it were a matter of culture you would expect Africans to produce different life outcomes in different societies. Instead what you always find with Africans is the same violence, mayhem, lack of educational attainment, promiscuity, high out of wedlock birthrates, fatherless homes and high rates of criminality wherever you find them.<br>
 <br>
They act the same way in Detroit as they act in Nairobi or Haiti or London. The common thread here is not religion or culture; it&rsquo;s RACE. </p>

			<p>To W.D.,</p>
<p>Detroit schools are chaotic and as permissive as any institution can get.  To stay safe, kids are allowed to do basically whatever they want in regard to acting out or wandering the halls.  The belief is that it&rsquo;s better to do that than face a wildly hysterical parent who gets vicious when Jamal or Shaniqua is told to behave. And it&rsquo;s better to do that than be beaten senseless (or worse) by a feral black teen.  </p>
<p>Detroit teachers are union people first, and only look to draw their sizable paychecks.  During contract renegotiation time, they strike instantly if they don&rsquo;t get what they want, regardless of their gross failure to discipline students, kick out the violent ones, and actually teach.  They gave up on actually teaching many years ago.  In Detroit, a state and federal tax sinkhole, it&rsquo;s &#8220;what&rsquo;s in it for me&#8221;?  </p>

			<p>I know it is old but I find it is true. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. How long must the insanity of giving people things and expecting them to go out and fend for themselves go on. </p>

			<p> &#8220;I think what we&rsquo;re seeing here is the result of CULTURE, not of race. (Of &ldquo;how to be and act in the world&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;genetic tendency to be stupid and criminal&rdquo;.)&#8221; &#8220;It chains them(black youths) to the belief that they&rsquo;re eternal victims instead of beloved children of the Eternal God. They are left with no belief in a glorious soul that transcends life and circumstance, so they sit in squalor and chase temporal pleasures and destroy themselves&#8221;</p>
<p>However, who creates that culture?? Blacks do. It&rsquo;s up to black parents to teach their kids life values. </p>

<p>Are these people for real? I have been out of work before, I never thought of picking up a gun and robbing a convenience store.</p>

<p> - Thank you! We hit hard times and went two years with no central heat, couldn&rsquo;t afford the propane. All we had was a kerosene heater in the living room and an electric space heater in the bedroom. This is in a 1700 square foot house. Janueary and February were hell, but we never thought of robbing a convenience store. </p>

			<p>Slowly but surely both blacks and whites will simultaneously see that low black aptitude and sky rocketing homicide are not a result of slavery but of genetics.<br>
When that time comes, the world will know.<br>
But only time will tell if the black man is humble enough to overcome his bitter jealousies and accept it.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know where to post this, so I hope the webmaster will let me post this here:  If we could all just live with our own kind, we could each achieve the best that our genetics will allow for each distinct race.  By mixing us all together, we become frustrated, feel oppressed and life becomes harder than it needs to be.</p>
<p>Look at birds.  They group together according to their type or breed.  They don&rsquo;t mix and integrate with other types of birds.  Do they have more wisdom than our Marxist social engineers?</p>
<p>Maybe there is some great achievement that the black race will give humanity if they are just left alone in Africa to develop at their own pace.  God has His reasons for making the different races and I think it is that we are all meant to achieve different things for the benefit of all.  But first we have to be separate in different lands so we don&rsquo;t all influence and antagonize each other with our differences.</p>
<p>Blacks in America have, of course, affected our culture.  Look at the way white celebrities dance today, like Britney Spears or Justin Timberlake, and also Justin Timberlake&rsquo;s singing style.  The first few times I heard Justin on the radio I could have sworn he was black!  Black influence has made entertainment more casual and less strait-laced, but has also made it more primitive and earthy.  So America&rsquo;s popular music and dance have not evolved upward and higher as should be expected.  (As a comparison, it would be like NASA actually losing scientific knowledge with every generation!)</p>
<p>Compare ballet to hip-hop dancing and you will see the intrinsic difference between Europeans and Africans.  Art forms are reflective of the souls of the people who create them.</p>

			<p>The problem remains. Digressive liberal propaganda never solves it, it only continues to attempt to hide a blunter conclusion - that there will always be a significant percentage of blacks in America that function sociopathicly. Whether that is caused by low IQ or a destroyed family culture, government and society must find a way to reduce the consequent ongoing harm to the public.</p>
<p>A first step might be to publicly and relentlessly nationally mock the myth of racism as a cause, or argument, or excuse for any criminal behavior.</p>
<p>A second step would be to repeal all &#8220;hate crime&#8221; laws. Existing crime law is sufficient protection for society, and hate crime laws perpetuate, not diminish, racist attitudes, especially among minorities (justifies their bitterness in their own minds and inevitably adds to the minority crime rate).</p>
<p>A third step would be to greatly increase prison trade school opportunities, to give recidivists a self-respecting alternate route in life - beneficial instead of harmful to others.</p>
<p>Changing minds and thus behavior, through these means and others, probably over several generations, is the only plausible way I can see to nudge the worst minority communities out of defaulting crime patterns. </p>
