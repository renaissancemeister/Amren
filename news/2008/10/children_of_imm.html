<p>Figures from the U.S. Census Bureau paint a clear picture: By as early as 2023, more than half of all children will be members of what are now minority groups, an evolution fueled significantly by a baby boom among recent immigrants. By 2050, they will make up more than 60 percent of all American children.</p>
<p>By 2050, the number of Americans of Hispanic origin will double to comprise a third of the American population. The Asian population is projected to nearly triple, to 9.2 percent of the population. And as those populations mingle, the number of people who identify themselves as being of two or more races will more than triple.</p>
<p>The result will be a United States in which the so-called white majority will, for the first time, be in the minority.</p>
<p>In the process, the children of new immigrants &#8220;will not only reshape American racial and ethnic relations but define the character of American social, cultural, and political life,&#8221; researchers at Harvard University and City University of New York write in &#8220;Inheriting the City,&#8221; a landmark study of the children of first-generation immigrants to the United States.</p>
<p>Crossing, assimilating differences</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a study of children of recent immigrants in Southern California and South Florida, Ruben Rumbaut, a sociology professor at the University of California-Irvine, and Alejandros Portes, director of the Center for Migration and Development at Princeton University, found that the so-called second generation was better equipped than ever to overcome historical hurdles like racism, economic disadvantage and language assimilation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p># In the Ivy League, 41 percent of all black freshmen are from African and Caribbean families, who make up only 13 percent of the overall black population, researchers at Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania found.</p>
<p># Among second-generation Hispanics, education is a priority, according to a nationwide study by the Public Policy Institute of California. Only 10 percent of second-generation adults have not graduated from high school, it found, compared with 38 percent of their first-generation parents. {snip}</p>
<p># While Hispanic immigrants as a whole vote less often than the overall population, the proportion of voters among second-generation Hispanics is rising rapidly, according to a 10-year study of immigrant achievement in California by researchers at the University of Southern California. {snip}</p>
<p>&lsquo;Increasingly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the mainstream&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Dumbarton Middle School, Principal Nancy Fink said all parents, native and immigrant, should welcome the transformation.</p>
<p>Referring to columnist Thomas L. Friedman&rsquo;s contention that a globalized society flattens economic and cultural differences, Fink said: &#8220;Parents are very aware that their children will be living in a flat world. So the more experiences they have with children who are different than them, the better.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;Our children will be living in flat world&#8221;&hellip;.is that putting a spin on things, or what!</p>
<p>Here is the truth seniorita Fink: Our children will be living in a nighmarish world ruled by mulattos, mestizos, and blacks&hellip;&hellip;..IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THAT WILL BE LIKE, GO VISIT AFRICA, HAITI, GUATEMALA, ETC.</p>

<p>True but this is only because Hispanics simply drove out the native white (and black) english speaking populations of these regions and thus never had to bother assimilating. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.So the more experiences they have with children who are different than them, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet, I grew up in what I believe was the single whitest town in my state and have had a tremendously sucessful life. Apparently going to an excellent public school somehow outweighed my disadvantage of growing with such a dearth of divirsity.</p>

<p>Why?  We were sold civil rights on the basis of creating a color-blind society, and then its beneficiaries turn around and do nothing but obsess over race, identity, heritage and all the rest, the very language which, if used by any European or white person, gets on branded a racist neo-Nazi.  </p>
<p>Today I had the misfortune of eating at a McDonald&rsquo;s in NYC.  The paper cover on the tray said, in Spanish, &#8220;Strong Heritage, Bright Futures,&#8221; and featured brown little faces in various professions.  What if a kid from Iowa or Idaho was told to look for inspiration to his heritage, to his ancestors - as is the norm in a any healthy culture?  Such a program could never exist.  And so we must welcome the &#8220;browning&#8221; of America under the banner that there is no such thing as race and that our society is color-blind - though now brown.  Madness.</p>

			<p>This means more subprime loans, requiring more deregulation to allow lenders to futilely attempt to spread the risk, caused by Democrats demands, and blamed on Republicans who merely gave the lenders the leeway to diversify the risk Democrats ignorantly insisted they take on.</p>
<p>McCain needs to point out that it was the subprime loans demanded by Democrats,, not the risk spreading financial derivatives created by Republican deregulation, that caused this financial crisis, or he is going to continue to slide in the polls against Obama, who is gaining ground by claiming opposite, and false, notion.</p>
<p>The cause of the financial crisis was subprime loans.</p>
<p>Deregulation enabled derivatives were merely an attempt to spread that Democrat demanded risk assumed by lenders.</p>
<p>Yet now Obama is trying to blame the Republicans and lenders, and it&rsquo;s all a lie.</p>
<p>Place the blame on Democrat demanded subprime lending, where it belongs.</p>

			<p>these kids can compose fifty or sixty percent of the population. they will comprise a tiny percent of scientists, executives, corporate lawyers, accountants, and math-science teachers.  whites need to hold steady and litigate every effort to push them out of jobs for which they qualify. if necessary whites need to cluster in states like New Hampshire and South Dakota and get European and Asian companies to invest in white rich areas.  don&rsquo;t make the mistake the south africans made by giving up transvaal to the blacks and agreeing to an integrated regime.</p>

			<p>What does Ted Kennedy know about the REAL WORLD??  He is the son of privilage and money.  The &#8220;new children of immigrants&#8221; (they forget to mention they are mostly illegal mex&rsquo;s and other assortment of garbage) are sure reshaping our country alright!! We are building MORE PRISONS to house them and our taxes are paying more welfare for their rotten spawn.  Most are criminals from whence they came.  More become bigger criminals once over the border.  We the whites, are in mortal danger, but then, our own government could care less, but they will, once we are either wiped out or leave the country period!!! I for one have had enough of these people and their lice.  Send them home to the dumps they came from.  Do it NOW!!</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s say this becomes truth and the US is now 1/2 Hispanic. What have the leftist politicos achieved? In hating America through &#8220;diversity&#8221; and self-inflicted hate against their own white culture, they will have destroyed a proud Eurocentric Empire. It will not be a jubilant day as they envision; but sadness will dash them about realizing the truth - that US culture has now become third world, there is no turning back and that they alone are to blame.</p>
<p>Full balkanization will have occurred. It will be an ugly and unforgiving place, filled with racial fear and conflict. It will not be the PC Haven they so wish for. Minorities will continue to predate the &#8220;New Minority (whites)&#8221; because of the failure of social engineering to close the &#8220;achievement gaps&#8221;. Ethnic Europeans will still control the better jobs, better opportunities and better lives because they are able to create change within themselves. Whilst the minorities, unable to do this, can only continue to feed off of the success of others.</p>
<p>Then it will be time for whites to root out the whites who did this.</p>

			<p>The thing that gets me is&hellip; what few white youths are still in existence seem just as dumb as blacks and hispanics. Even dumber, maybe.</p>
<p>When was the last time somebody got your order right the first time at a fast-food place, for example?! You stand around for five minutes in an empty store trying to get someone&rsquo;s attention, then they stare at you blankly, get it all wrong, and ring it up wrong as well. It happens with such deadly consistency at any franchise fast-food place I go, regardless of the predominant ethnicity of the staff, that I think it must be the norm. Call it equal opportunity stupidity, I guess.</p>
<p>Funny how the only places that seem to have prompt, attentive service anymore are Mexican takeout. There&rsquo;s always someone running the front window, usually a portly female, who speaks English pretty well and keeps things coordinated. If I just want something to eat and don&rsquo;t want to stand around discussing various mistakes in the order with blank-faced zombies, I get Mexican takeout!</p>

<p>No, children will grow up living, not in a flat world, but in a 3rd world. I feel for our children and grandchildren, I really do.<br>

			<p> What does this writer mean, &#8220;the so-called white majority&#8221;? It is still a 67 percent majority, and that&rsquo;s only if you count all Hispanics as non-white, which is inaccurate.</p>
<p> And note how the whole tone of this piece suggests that it&rsquo;s oh, so wonderful that we Whites, we European-Americans, are being immigrated and bred out of the majority in the America that we built, whose government we created, whose Constitution we wrote. Will this be the first time in history that a major country has completely changed its ethnic makeup, right in the middle of its own greatness? If it is, it will be the first time a power has done it VOLUNTARILY. John Lennon of the Beatles once said, &#8220;Life is what happens while you&rsquo;re making other plans.&#8221; Sometimes, so is disaster.</p>

			<p>So, in other words by the year 2050 America will finally achieve third world status. Well, the whites living then can thank their liberal ancestors for their plight. I have a feeling it isn&rsquo;t going to be pretty for whitey.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a lot more worried about the offspring of LEGAL immigrants from Africa, Asia, and the Indian sub-continent (not to mention the Middle East) who take places from White American youngsters in the colleges and professional schools. As educational institutions favor the children of the &#8220;new&#8221; immigrants in their drive for &#8220;diversity,&#8221; White American children lose. And many of the posters on Amren are way, way too sanguine about Asians. They pose every bit as much of a threat as the Mexicans, if not more&hellip;</p>

			<p>How about a white, nation in the pacific Northwest. Where we can experience a rebirth, or a Diginified exit from existence? Why let us fall to such decay, without one last try? I say to all who may read this, please consider moving to the Pacific Northwest, where we can gain a foothold, and than secede either by peaceble means, a balkinization or guerilla war! We cannot stand for this de facto genocide. Disgusting. We are dying as a people, and when after 2060 will we have it as good as the non-whites now? Nope. THEY WILL LORD it over us, seeking vengeance STILL.</p>

			<p>From the above article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Among second-generation Hispanics, education is a priority, according to a nationwide study by the Public Policy Institute of California. Only 10 percent of second-generation adults have not graduated from high school, it found, compared with 38 percent of their first-generation parents&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Where on earth did they come up with those statistics? </p>
<p>Remember:  The government counts GEDs (about 10%) as part of its high school graduation rates. And&hellip;</p>
<p>Steve Sailer writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;James J. Heckman, a Nobel Laureate and 2002 Statistician of the Year, of the U. of Chicago, and co-author Paul A. LaFontaine of the American Bar Association report:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;exhaustive study of the widest array of data sources consulted to date finds that the high school dropout rate isn&rsquo;t 12 percent, but about twice that. And the racial gaps have been steady since the early 1970s&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.vdare.com/sailer/080101_dropout.htm</p>
<p>And from Ed Rubenstein, &#8220;Hispanic High School Disaster – The Evidence Mounts&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Among first generation (at least one parent born in the U.S.) Hispanics aged 16-24, the comparable dropout rate was 14.6%&hellip;.Among second generation Hispanics, the dropout rate was actually worse: 15.9. </p>
<p>Only 6.9% of all whites in the 16-24 age group lacked HS degrees..&#8221;</p>
<p>And lest we forget:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The average Hispanic 12th-grader reads and does math at the level of the average white 8th-grader&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The high school curriculum has been dumbed down immensely for &#8216;average&rsquo; students, the California Exit Exam is a joke, written at a 7th grade (if that) level  &mdash;  I should know, I&rsquo;ve been giving it (and studying the REAL exam, not the Kaplan practices, which are much harder) for many years now. </p>
<p>I collect old high school textbooks from the 60s and earlier  &mdash;  they read more like what an average state college textbook looks like and bear no resemblance to the much easier ones used today (which are filled with pictures and illustrations and less text along with a heavy dose of anti-White PC). </p>
<p>I assume the lies in the article above will be used by the open-borders lobby, without any rebuttal, as proof as to how well hispanics are assimilating into mainstream America  &mdash;  and of course, to petition for an amnesty and higher numbers of legal hispanic immigrants. </p>

			<p>All this assumes a peaceful, if disasterous assimilation.  That is, at best, wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Long before it gets anywhere near those levels, it will spark a third world war.  It&rsquo;s already starting in europe.  And the seeds of this in the US have been planted pretty deep this year by what can only be described as a dramatic redistribution of wealth from the whites who earned it to blacks and mexican criminals who didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tolerance is wearing pretty thin.  Or did people miss the violent language being thrown about by McCain supporters at his rallies, recently.</p>
<p>There is very deep, very intense anger against blacks and mexicans in this country.  It&rsquo;s been building for years now but it&rsquo;s close to a boiling point.</p>
<p>It could easily lead to a three way civil war&hellip;.mexicans to the west, blacks to the south and whites everywhere else.  The problem with this for the dark folk is all the production is being done by the whites.  If war breaks out, whites will stop feeding them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not ready to happen yet.  For now, most whites consider the colored races within our borders to be of our community&hellip;.so the gravy train continues.  Most understand on some level that this is not true but few know the extent to which these people are our enemies.  That could change damn quick though.</p>

			<p>Remember - our government was involved in the strong arm tactics leading to the downfall of civilization in South Africa. The National Party won both the North and West Cape provinces in &#8216;94. We and the British advised the ANC, who gerrymandered the north and moved millions of poor bantus to the west, changing the demographics, and ending any real chance of a volkstaat. Americans were busy placing their &#8220;End Apartheid&#8221; bumper stickers and watching assenine Lethal Weapon movies. No one was there to help the Afrikaners, and I suspect no one will be here to help us. </p>

			<p>This is why I pray every day for an economic collapse. Though it turns my stomach to think of a black man running my country, I can&rsquo;t help but think that we&rsquo;ll be better off in the long run if Obama gets elected. I&rsquo;ve come to the realization that America can&rsquo;t be fixed within the confines of the current system. Sadly, America will have to fall so that it can be re-built in a better form, and the sooner the better. This article mentions the declining birth rates among whites, which is probably the biggest part of our problems. If the racial revolution happens fifty or more years from now, we wont be nearly as successful as we&rsquo;ll be if it happens now. Try to imagine an America where the Unholy Triumvirate of Obama, Reid, and Pelosi reigns supreme. Now throw an economic depression into the mix, and what do you have? A recipe for revolution. This country is probably heading for an economic disaster of historic proportions. I&rsquo;ve long maintained that America couldn&rsquo;t survive another economic depression. Americans might hold quaint delusions about racial harmony when things are good, but history shows that when the bottom drops out, people become very realistic in their views of the world. When whites have to fight with Blacks and Hispanics for bread, they&rsquo;ll change their tune about integration. I think that an economic disaster is probably inevitable, regardless of who gets elected, but I&rsquo;m confident that Obama would do the most damage. The Unholy Triumvirate will go out of its&rsquo; way to make sure that what little money is left will go its&rsquo; base of support. (I think we all know who that is.) When middle of the road white people see their country falling down around them while the black leader gives what little we have left to his brethren, I think they&rsquo;ll rise up. But&hellip; that&rsquo;s just my humble opinion.</p>

			<p>Like Central and South America, the rich will live in gated communities with small armies for protection and rest continue to breed, kill, rape and rob one another in squalor.</p>
<p>If you have any doubt, try visiting Compton in Los Angeles or the South Bronx in NYC&hellip;it is a very nerveracking view of America&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Other than this site and a few others, why are people afraid of saying that the nation is declining due to third world immigration and Liberal policies?</p>

			<p>This is exactly why my wife and I thank God every day that we made the personal, responsible decision not to have children. We never could imagine leaving a part of ourselves behind in this sewer nation. We have never questioned or regretted our decision for a second. </p>
<p>We are both highly-educated, upper-middle class Whites who enjoy our lives and our time together. We make good money and we have nice weekends and holiday getaways with our extended families and friends. We spend abundant time with our nieces and nephews when we want to be around children. We are heartsick over the prospects of the future they will live in the sewer nation they stand to inherit. </p>
<p>Of course, we been viciously condemned, accused of being selfish, and accused of betraying other Whites by our choice to abstain from procreation. Conversely, we see our choice far differently. </p>
<p>Multiculturalism is a hellish nightmare. Choosing not to condemn our unborn children to a multicultural existence is the best gift we could ever bestow upon them. </p>
<p>When I die someday, I will rest in peace. If I thought I was leaving a part of myself behind, to eventually mongrelize with undesirables, I would grieve the betrayal of my own children from my deathbed. That is not our way.<br>

			<p> generalquagmyer, why are you still eating fast food?  Don&rsquo;t you know that these people bring parasites with them from the third world countries they live in?</p>
<p>There will be no escape, unless you want to live off the grid on some armed compound that is self sustaining.  But then you will have to contend with the US government, who will come after you and create some false story that you are anarchists and shoot the whole family, including women and children.</p>
<p>Anywhere that there are jobs, these people are going to congregate.  That is why they come here - to take our jobs away from us and if they can&rsquo;t do that, then they take our money through taxes to live on welfare.</p>
<p>That was one huge mistake South Africa made - they should have never hired natives to do their manual labor and as servants, or given them any charity whatsoever.  Western culture and society does not agree with Blacks - it does something bad to them.  Whenever they live amongst Whites, there will always be clashes.  They do not respect or understand charity, and they resent Whites when they work for them, because they become envious and want the good life without the work.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Then it will be time for whites to root out the whites who did this.&#8221; </p>
<p>I find this sentiment to be useless in the extreme.  Now is the time for anything worth doing at all.  </p>
<p>Why is the only foe you are willing to take on a few remnants of already beaten whites, and that only when it is far too late?  </p>
<p>How pathetic to do no more than promise that you&rsquo;ll spit in the eye of another white man for his failings as you go with him into the darkness, blaming him for it without having yourself done your best to prevent that sorry fate.</p>
<p>Surely, you can do better than that. </p>
<p>What good is this lamenting I see about how few and how foolish our children are? Think so?  Have more!  Teach them! </p>
<p>Does the treachery of some whites, or the complacent ignorance of others make you curse the encroaching dark?  </p>
<p>Then light a candle!  Build a bon-fire!  Set the hearts of your fellows ablaze! </p>
<p>How?  Catch fire yourself, then touch another.  Do something useful, help your fellow (you can find some way), help your family, your neighbors, your community. </p>
<p>Apply the skills &amp; resources you have already, learn new ones.</p>
<p>Have some pride, and do all you can to be worthy of it.  Be the kind of person to be proud of, and an inspiration to others.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Where shall we go now?&#8221; my ass.  Nowhere, save where I choose to go!  Boldly into the future, one of my own making.  </p>
<p>Children destined to live in the third world?  Get thee behind me satan!  Speak for yourself alone, cretin!  </p>
<p>Mine will not, for I will not allow it.  Neither will yours, if you will simply work to make it so.   </p>
<p>Simple.  Easy?  Who gives a damn!</p>

			<p>&#8220;This is why I pray every day for an economic collapse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly. I may sound crazy but a huge economic collapse would halt immigration,illegal or legal because with no jobs and money, there will be nothing to come to. Any governmental attempts to replace americans with foreigners will provoke outrage if things get tough enough.  There is one thing white americans won&rsquo;t tolerate is no money or jobs. Too many white americans today, especially the upper middle class, have gotten soft and spoiled and have had it too easy. What white america needs to do is get hit and get hit hard. No money, no jobs, an economy in the toilet. Then they&rsquo;ll be a whole lot less sympathetic to all the non-whites who drain our welfare system and demand things. They&rsquo;ll no longer be sympathetic to all these overbreeding mexicans. Multiculutalism and &#8220;tolerance&#8221; will fall apart when things break down between warring ethnic groups.</p>
<p> &#8220;Though it turns my stomach to think of a black man running my country,&#8221;</p>
<p>If he were a black man that was going to do what is best for america, I wouldn&rsquo;t care that he was black. I&rsquo;d vote for a black who opposed immigration anyday over a white sellout. However, Obama is a black marxist.</p>

Americans have to get over their mentality of running away.  They&rsquo;ve been running  for half a century.   Their options every year are getting slimmer.  Sooner or later they&rsquo;ll have nowhere left to run. Eventually, they&rsquo;re going to have to take a stand and make the best of what they&rsquo;ve got.   Better now than later.</p>

			<p>Bottom line seems to be America is becoming MEXICO NORTH!With the accompanying crime, squalor and dumbed down mentality of the population. With the wealthy elite living in gated, well-guarded enclaves, safely insulated from the bovine-like poverty striken masses. (The business owners, corporate heads DO NOT want the Hispanics demanding the same wages as White Americans. because that cuts into the profits picture. The answer being to clamor for YET MORE IMMIGRATION, to outsource to overseas locations, whenever possible.</p>
<p>I personally am hoping for critical mass (number of legal and illegal immigrants) to be reached. Hopefully once critical mass is reached, the American people will pitch in, en masse, to do what is necessary. </p>

			<p>When was the last time somebody got your order right the first time at a fast-food place, for example?! You stand around for five minutes in an empty store trying to get someone&rsquo;s attention, then they stare at you blankly, get it all wrong, and ring it up wrong as well. It happens with such deadly consistency at any franchise fast-food place I go, regardless of the predominant ethnicity of the staff, that I think it must be the norm. Call it equal opportunity stupidity, I guess.</p>
<p>My wife and I recently ate at a Dairy Queen, which is new in my area and the employees were all WHITE!! no blacks anywhere, even the MANAGER was white and our order was correct the first time. I&rsquo;m sure it will be all black when I get to the states next time, but it was a pleasant surprise at the time.</p>

<p>Read Brenda Walkers articles on how Learning-Averse Hispanic culture is.  As someone who spent some years in various parts of Latin America and who has studied its History beginning from Spain over 500 years ago I can attest to the fact, though it should be obvious to all, that this article was sheer Propaganda.  Dishonest Propaganda.  And that last line was a joke.  It&rsquo;s like they don&rsquo;t even care how obvious it sounds. <br>
MSNBC is indistinguishable from Noel Ignatiev.  It isn&rsquo;t pro non-White so much as it is anti-White.<br>
They don&rsquo;t sound like they even care if the races all go after each other.  It&rsquo;s like their anti-White blood lust has made them unhinged and stop the lies and exaggerations and unrealistically high expectations.<br>
But worse, to me, though obviously filled with propaganda, the article really read like more of a threat to all whites not willing to aquiesce.<br>
Like many people I am anxious for this &#8220;Election&#8221; to be over so we can see, once and for all, whether or not our concern is justifiable. If it turns out to be justifiable then don&rsquo;t think that the Left will hesitate for a second to put us in camps; like the same kind they whinned about in Guantanamo.</p>

			<p>Yes, WE will need an economic collapse.Very Severe droughts will push events in our direction also. For the past several years the American West has been experiencing a terrible drought. Worst in 500 years. The situation hasn&rsquo;t improved a bit. Arizona is becomming a hellish place to live because of the drought and rising temperatures. Another severe drought in the American South summer of 2009 would be excellent also.</p>
<p>If Native Born White Americans wanted to shut post-1965 immigration down 0 they could do it. The will isn&rsquo;t there yet. But if there was a will, there is a way.</p>
<p>If Native Born White Americans did not have the option of fleeing post-1965 non-whites for the past 30 years, the quality of life in America would have been so unbearable and degraded that-and I will say this with 100 percent certainty-there would have been a revolt by now and all immigraton would have been shut down to 0. So, if we are to be honest about the situation, the level of pain is great enough for a critical number of Native Born White Americans. For what ever reason, there are still a large number of Natve Born White Americans who either don&rsquo;t percieve the very serious threat on the horizon or who actively distracting themselves from this very serious threat on the horizon. </p>
<p>Possibly, the UK will explode before they explode in the US. This would very likely speed up the revolt in America.</p>

By 2050, they will make up more than 60 percent of all American children.&#8221;</p>

			<p>To GENERALQUAGMYER&hellip;</p>
<p>Not sure if my earlier post got through, QUAGGY, but Houston is just about crawling with taco trailers and slopcart vendors. A co-worker a couple of years back stupidly bought himself a couple of breakfast tacos from a guy pushing a slopcart near the office. Several hours later, the poor co-worker thought he was dying. Deathly skin color, turning inside out (both ends). Sick as a dog. He lost about three days work before he could get back on his feet. Thanks to the cleanliness habits of the slopcart vendor he stupidly bought his breakfast from.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not unheard of that a vendor unzips, urinates under the cart, then wipes his hands on his pants. Then pushes the cart ten, twenty yards and sets up in a new location. Nor are restaurant helpers and the fast food slop joint employees any cleaner. Mexican disregard of laws and regulations is legendary. The illegals hired by the restaurants and fast food franchise owners are just as bad for the most part. There is not much of a margin so to cut expenses, restaurant and fast food franchise owners hire illegals for every position possible. You eat at the average restaurant in a city or town having a large illegal population, you run a risk. Ever hear of &#8220;brainworm&#8221; parasites. Other parasites and viruses also get passed on. Besides, why would the Mexican worker care? Gringos are too fussy. And for resenting the presence of illegals, the Mexicans figure the Americans DESERVE whatever illnesses they pick up. So please, QUAGGY, wise up and tell your friends and neighbors to eat at some. Saving money and saving their health.</p>

			<p>More and more, lately, when I read the articles here, more truthful to me the observation becomes that is said by posters like Robert Kelly about the focus of the problems attached to race realism being not blacks and the rest, but whites. How inevitably and irreversibly a large portion of whites gravitate to idiocy! And how impossible it is to imagine a country containing these whites persisting for any significant length of time! Who can doubt that any outcome of this current mess in which the caucasian race survives must see these whites destroyed as the evolutionary failures that they, if not always were, now are?</p>

Afterall, the very fact that millions upon millions of foreign nationals can enter a nation, commit heinous crimes, bankrupt the social services Americans paid into, create wage depression in unskilled and semi-skilled work, wave foreign flags in Americans faces, march and occupy our cities, while saying we need to go back to Europe,etc. and do it for years, says more about our character as Americans, then it does theirs as invaders. It certainly says tons about our government and those elites who run it. Sorry if this bothers some Americans, it bothers me also, but this is our reality. </p>

I live in rural Washington. It&rsquo;s become more liberal in the past ten years, and we have been invaded by huge numbers of Mexicans.  Oregon is even worse.  The mythos of the Great Pacific Northwest as a safe haven for whites is just that:   a myth.  It won&rsquo;t work because we lack the political will and because the invasion has already occurred.  Interestingly, I have a dream of going to Idaho or  Montana, but I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s under the same invasion as Washington and Oregon.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to understand how spaced-out they are when you consider the enormous, inflated salaries those TV personalities and newscasters make.  I read that Charles Gibson makes 6 million a year. Even a weather reporter makes a couple of hundred thousand.  </p>
<p>These people don&rsquo;t know what real life is like for real people.  They live in a rarified world. They are completely out of touch.</p>

			<p>Yes, WE will need an economic collapse. Very Severe droughts will push events in our direction also. For the past several years the American West has been experiencing a terrible drought. Worst in 500 years. Arizona is becomming a hellish place to live because of the drought and rising temperatures. Another severe drought in the American South summer of 2009 would be excellent also.<br>

<p>Arizona is becoming &#8220;hellish&#8221; because of drought and temperature? Not to Mexicans it isn&rsquo;t.<br>
You won&rsquo;t drive out Mexicans that way. They are used to heat. They are used to drought. They are used to poverty.  If need be, they will out-survive us, and they will still be in the South and West when we are gone.  </p>
<p>No, we need something more.  Drought, heat and poverty will help, but they&rsquo;re not enough. Mainly, they will drive out our own first.</p>

Most airlines pursue a muticultural agenda,and this has caused most of the problems in the airline industry,U.S.Air,and Southwest more than others.<br>
In the 80&rsquo;s,around the time of a merger between U.S.Air and PSA,an airliner crashed in California killing all on board.An employee was fired at Lax or SFO airport,can&rsquo;t remember which,the fired employee,using his airline I.D.,followed the manager who fired him aboard a flight and shot him in his seat,he then forced a flight attendant to open the cockpit door,at which time she said to the flight crew,&#8221;we have a problem&#8221;,the shooter said,&#8221;and I am the problem&#8221;!he then shot the captain and first officer,the plane crashed,killing all on board,the media went to great pains trying not to let us know that the shooter was black!<br>
this story was available at www.airdisasters.com at one time,but may have been removed because of political correctness concerns,the aircraft involved was a BAE 146,if one wants to do a search on the story.</p>

<p>They do know to stay out of a black neighborhood after dark though. Yes, they are out of touch but deep down in their little hearts, they know.</p>

			<p>&#8220;My MD cousin said he saw his first case of leprosy in the Free Clinic &mdash; brought in by an immigrant from Polynesia&#8221;</p>
<p>Here in Texas, we now have the distinction of having the 2nd highest TB rate in the USA. This disease had become uncommon and now in just a short time it is back. I live in a &#8220;sanctary city&#8221; and we recently had a large outbreak of typus, another uncommon disease. The CDC had to come to our town. Whooping cough is also on the rise. Of course the media is mum on the cause.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a mistake to look at the statistics of the country as a whole in this debate. Look at the racial demographics of each state, then at areas within each state. You&rsquo;ll find that states like PA, Ohio, and, regions like Upstate NY are vastly white and, unless throngs of immigrants move in, will stay majority white, unlike FLorida, California, Texas and, the big cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is the problem. These immigrants will, if allowed to keep coming, destroy Florida, California and Texas. Then once they have destroyed it and the quality of life is in the toilet, they&rsquo;ll leave for better places(ie.white places). They&rsquo;ll head to Ohio, PA, Upstate NY etc. People in white areas think that it won&rsquo;t affect them but it will spread to them.</p>

			<p>Michigan Patriot is right on!!  Ted Kennedy was an evil stooge.  Some say his lack of intelligence has killed of our hopes and dreams for any kind of a dignified future.  But I&rsquo;ve always felt that Kennedy did this on purpose.  He knew what he was doing and he set out to destroy our nation.  He hated this nation for many reasons that I&rsquo;ll leave to the readers to guess.  He destroyed the white culture and white civil rights on purpose!!  And this is why many non-whites love him!</p>
