				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jon Land, Dash24.com, Oct. 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission today warned that Britain risks fuelling anti-immigrant sentiment unless it takes active steps to help those hit hardest by the economic crisis &mdash; including the white working class.</p>
<p>Trevor Phillips&rsquo; warning comes ahead of  his appearance at a CBI conference on immigration today, where he will sit on a panel alongside Immigration Minister Phil Woolas.</p>
<p>The conference comes after suggestions that the UK population should be &ldquo;capped&rdquo; at 70 million. Mr Phillips will argue that such a cap is wrong and unenforceable.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;After forty years in which it was impolite to speak frankly about immigration policy, we now must be able to address this fundamental aspect of economic policy without embarrassment or without fear of being labelled closet racists or open-border fantasists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what is to come, the best defence against prejudice against immigrants will be to make those who resent them competitive, to give them a place in society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may need to do so with the sort of special measures we&rsquo;ve previously targeted at ethnic minorities. But the name of the game today is to tackle inequality, not racial special pleading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an earlier interview, Mr Phillips said he wanted to see &lsquo;positive action&rsquo; for those hardest hit in the downturn, particularly the white working class who feel threatened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we are seeing is that there is a whole group of people, a large proportion of whom are white, who are going to suffer from this crisis who are going to be the people we should want to help, particularly because they come from the wrong side of town,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to have to do something special for them. We are going to have to put extra resources where young people can&rsquo;t compete with migrants&rsquo; skills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in some parts of the country, it is clear that what defines disadvantage won&rsquo;t be black or brown, it will be white. And we will have to take positive action to help some white groups, what we might call the white underclass.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Immigration Minister Phil Woolas also addressed today&rsquo;s summit.</p>
<p>He promised earlier this month that the UK population would not rise as high as 70 million but denied a cap was being imposed.</p>
<p>Today, he said: &ldquo;Let me make it very clear, the Government is not proposing to cap migration. Neither is it looking to set an upper limit on migration, but we need to recognise that the labour market might change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the new points system, which comes into effect next month, &ldquo;will enable us to raise or lower the barrier&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Labour has opposed a capping limit, unlike the Conservatives.</p>
<p>Mr Woolas, who became Immigration Minister in this month&rsquo;s reshuffle, hit the headlines when he said: &ldquo;People didn&rsquo;t believe the authorities knew what they were doing and there&rsquo;s a very good reason for that &mdash; they didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The MP for Oldham East &amp; Saddleworth received a custard pie in the face on Friday courtesy of a member of pro-migration group Manchester No Borders during a debate at the University of Manchester.</p>
<p>He had been due to appear on Question Time on Thursday but denied his last-minute withdrawal was because he was being &ldquo;gagged&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Woolas also made controversial comments hinting at a loss of privileges for the Church of England during an interview with The Times.</p>
<p>During a question and answer session after his speech, Mr Phillips said Britain was not &ldquo;full&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He compared it with a half-full Wembley stadium where everyone wanted to sit behind the goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rebuilt Wembley. You don&rsquo;t say you won&rsquo;t let any more people in here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to be rational about it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve told the summit the new points system was &ldquo;a step in the right direction&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, a points based system without an upper limit is pointless. That is why we have proposed an upper annual limit on economic migration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst we cannot restrict inward EU migration, this would allow us to control migration from outside the EU, which is around two-thirds of the foreign nationals arriving in the UK each year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Grieve said annual net migration from outside the EU had risen 144%, from 88,000 in 1997 to 215,000 in 2006.</p>
<p>He said the total net migration since 1997 was two million.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;Sir&#8221; Trevor Phillips is just upset that immigrants other than blacks are getting so much attention, coddling, and most of all millions of pounds yearly directed to non african immigrant rights and community organizations.</p>
<p>British blacks must now compete with numerous other grievance groups for government money, housing, affirmative action jobs, benefits and media coverage of their myriad imaginery grievances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir&#8221; Trevor is lost in a sea of third worlder activists. </p>
<p>He is like a 6 year old who has been an only child all his life and suddenly  Mommy gives birth to triplets who take up all her time.</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;Britain risks fuelling anti-immigrant sentiment unless it takes active steps to help those hit hardest by the economic crisis &mdash; including the white working class.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s curious how Mr. Phillips links immigration, economic crisis, and the white working class. Does Mr. Phillips see a connection? Does Mr. Phillips see the inherent problem of bringing in more immigrants during an economic crisis and the negative affects this has on the white working class? </p>
<p>Mr. Phillips and everyone else sees the problem (too many immigrants) and the solution (fewer immigrants) staring them in the face.</p>
<p>Mr. Phillips sees the cause and effect. What he doesn&rsquo;t want is the white working class to take notice and act appropriately.<br/>

			<p>I just love the statement, &hellip;&hellip;&#8221;unless it takes active steps to help those hit hardest by the economic crisis  &mdash;  including the white working class.&#8221; </p>
<p>I could say so many things about this statement, from so many different considerations, but what would be the point. If it isn&rsquo;t obvious to any white Britain, then they surely deserve to sink into perdition. My God. </p>

			<p>So the British don&rsquo;t like non whites because they take their jobs and lower their wages.  What will he say when the British don&rsquo;t like non whites because they shoot and mug them because it is obvious that they now have  good paying jobs?</p>

			<p>When I read this story from another source, I thought to myself that Trevor Phillips has all but become a member of the BNP.  People like to laugh at the BNP, and ridicule its relative lack of electoral success, compared to other nationalist-right European parties, but if they can get a black cabinet member of a center-left administration to adopt a crucial part of its agenda, then it can&rsquo;t be said not to be effective.</p>

<p>This Phillips guy doesn&rsquo;t care about whites. What he is afraid of is that if whites get too angry and disenfranchised, they might actually stand up for themselves and look out for their own race, just like blacks and others do. So he wants to placate whites in order to prevent this from happening.</p>

			<p>Is it not telling that as a population becomes more diverse they head towards a government that is more tyrannical in an effort to keep consensus in said population?</p>

			<p>How come that its all the fault of these imaginary &#8220;FAR-RIGHT&#8221; groups?</p>
<p>The reason working class white people (and the rest of us come to mention it) are angry is that we are being dispossed of our own country.</p>
<p>They are underclass because they have been made that way.</p>
<p>Phillips is one of the multicultural Stormtroopers who have been busying themselves for decades to destroy our communities, cultures, way of life, history, morals and sense of belonging. Our kids no longer know who they are - only ethnics like Phillips are allowed a cultural identity that is respected - we have had ours bulldozed to make way for theirs.</p>
<p>He is just throwing a bone to the white working classes in the hope they will still blindly vote for the socialist Labour Party as they have done for decades.</p>
<p>There is only one political party for indiginous whites in the UK - the British National Party.</p>
<p>Check out their site - its the most popular political site by a mile!<br/>

And their new British heritage site to counter the anti British propaganda in the state school system.<br/>

			<p>I&rsquo;m in two minds over this.<br/>
On the one hand what Trevor Phillips says does have an element of truth.<br/>
On the other hand, I can&rsquo;t help thinking that Mr. Phillips is trying to prove his &#8216;superiority&rsquo; by having a pop at someone he can look down upon.<br/>
 And, by the way, the black Carribean population in Britain (of which Mr. Phillips belongs), has the highest level of all social dysfunctionsof any ethnicity in Britain.<br/>

			<p>Until whites in Britain get rid of their government and replace the House of Windsor with another royal family, they are going to continue on this path to national suicide. At some point, a radical British government is going to destroy the monarchy anyway.  You&rsquo;d better act soon, John Bull.</p>

			<p>This white underclass referred to above is not white working class. Not when they are composed of three or more consecutive generations of ignorant, lazy, innumerate, illiterate, anti-social, unemployable louts living free in social housing, paying no rent or council tax and drawing huge continual unemployment benefits to keep them in smokes and take-away junk food. School-age single mothers being provided with their own free flats and not being prosecuted for hundreds of shoplifting offences only encourage the breeding programme. The offspring refuse to be educated (&#8216;can&rsquo;t be bovvered&rsquo;) but likewise cannot legally be excluded from school for violent, disruptive and criminal behaviour which prevents real students from receiving a full, meaningful, white working class education. The huge gangs of drugged, alcohol fuelled hooded youngsters and pre-teens who roam council estates and inner cities all night long, stealing, smashing and burning anything they find and making life impossible for human beings is the result of the official policy of preventing civilians and police alike from beating the living daylights out of them at the first sign of anti-social behaviour. This is me on a good day, if I am ever elected, there will be no more mister nice guy!</p>

			<p>The House of Windsor is really the House of Gotha-Saxe-Coburg, Xenophon.  They changed their name to &#8220;Windsor&#8221; in 1917 because Britain happened to have been at war with Germany for three years at the time.  As a racial Celt, I long for the day when a Welshman is again the Prince of Wales.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about the political situation in England and that&rsquo;s just as well. </p>
<p>What I would like to know is why everyone tries to make &#8220;working class&#8221; sound like a dirty word. In my opinion the working class are the only people that count. It&rsquo;s not the priest that feeds the peasant it&rsquo;s the peasant that feeds the priest. This includes politicians, they would starve without the working class.</p>

			<p>Trevor Phillips is worried because he knows which way the wind is now blowing. He has never done a constructive days work in his life, he is a professional blackman and has made a very good living on the public purse, he is a marxist and proud of it (he admitted to admitting to this at a Royal Gardenparty) He drives a Jaguar and lives in a large house, I&rsquo;d worry too, wouldn&rsquo;t you!</p>
