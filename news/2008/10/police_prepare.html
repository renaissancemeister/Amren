<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Police departments in cities across the country are beefing up their ranks for Election Day, preparing for possible civil unrest and riots after the historic presidential contest.</p>
<p>Public safety officials said in interviews with The Hill that the election, which will end with either the nation&rsquo;s first black president or its first female vice president, demanded a stronger police presence.</p>
<p>Some worry that if Barack Obama loses and there is suspicion of foul play in the election, violence could ensue in cities with large black populations. Others based the need for enhanced patrols on past riots in urban areas (following professional sports events) and also on Internet rumors.</p>
<p>Democratic strategists and advocates for black voters say they understand officers wanting to keep the peace, but caution that excessive police presence could intimidate voters.</p>
<p>Sen. Obama (Ill.), the Democratic nominee for president, has seen his lead over rival Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) grow in recent weeks, prompting speculation that there could be a violent backlash if he loses unexpectedly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Oakland, the police will deploy extra units trained in riot control, as well as extra traffic police, and even put SWAT teams on standby.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Oakland police last faced big riots in 2003 when the Raiders lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the Super Bowl. Officials are bracing themselves in case residents of Oakland take Obama&rsquo;s loss badly.</p>
<p>Political observers such as Hilary Shelton and James Carville fear that record voter turnout could overload polling places on Election Day and could raise tension levels.</p>
<p>Shelton, the director of the NAACP&rsquo;s Washington bureau, said inadequate voting facilities is a bigger problem in poor communities with large numbers of minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carville, who served as a senior political adviser to former President Bill Clinton, said that many Democrats would be very angry if Obama loses. He noted that many Democrats were upset by Sen. John Kerry&rsquo;s (D-Mass.) loss to President Bush in the 2004 election, when some Democrats made allegations of vote manipulation in Ohio, the state that ultimately decided the race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carville said earlier this month that &#8220;it would be very, very, very dramatic out there&#8221; if Obama lost, a statement some commentators interpreted as predicting riots. In an interview Tuesday, however, Carville said he did not explicitly predict rioting.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of Democrats would have a great deal of angst and anger,&#8221; said Carville, who predicted that on Election Day &#8220;the voting system all around the country is going to be very stressed because there&rsquo;s going to be enormous turnout.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If [Obama] is elected, like with sports championships, people may go out and riot,&#8221; said Bob Parks, an online columnist and black Republican candidate for state representative in Massachusetts. &#8220;If Barack Obama loses there will be another large group of people who will assume the election was stolen from him&hellip;.. This will be an opportunity for people who want to commit mischief.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shelton, of the NAACP, said he understands the need for police to maintain order. But he is also concerned that some political partisans may point their finger at black voters as potential troublemakers because the Democratic nominee is black.</p>
<p>Shelton said any racial or ethnic group would get angry if they felt disenfranchised because of voting irregularities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Frank Vanore, of the Philadelphia Police Department, said officials were planning to mobilize to control exuberant or perhaps angry demonstrations after the World Series, which pits the Phillies against the Tampa Bay Rays.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>So if I&rsquo;m reading this right, they&rsquo;re saying that Blacks might riot no matter what the outcome is. LOL. Let&rsquo;s hope that if they do, the riots will be big enough to cause a massive White Backlash. </p>

<p>With all my digits, however, I still couldn&rsquo;t count up the number of times that Africans have caused civil unrest in Illinois because they didn&rsquo;t get their way. </p>
<p>Just one more reason to not live anywhere near a concentration of Africans.  And I don&rsquo;t.</p>

			<p> Notice how the only assumptions that are made in the article are that (a) Many blacks may not get to vote because of what the writer implies would be &#8220;voter suppression,&#8221; and (b) If Obama loses, many Democrats will assume the election was &#8220;stolen from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>  This in an election where Barack Hussein has raised, as of today, $603 million, much of it through bending and probably outright breaking of the election financing laws; and where the ACORN organization, sworn to get Obama elected by hook or crook, has been conducting illegal voter registration activities in as many as 15 states (that we know about so far). The election may be stolen all right, but not by White Republicans.</p>

<p>Note the duplicitous use of the passive voice here.  If &#8220;there is suspicion of foul play&#8221; by whom?  White evangelicals?  Soccer moms?  Oh, you mean by blacks!  The population that believed that OJ was innocent and that has rioted so many times in recent decades!<br>

			<p>Shelton said any racial or ethnic group would get angry if they felt disenfranchised because of voting irregularities&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..Hmmm it seems that whites have been disenfranchised for years.The way they Gerrymander voteing districts.My own town is split in half by two congressional districts so minorities can get elected.As far as election day violence Barack Obama could in fact be held responsible for the violence in Kenya. He supposedly used his influence to get a member of his fellow Luo tribe mans elected president. Like I said when you have an election in any majority African country you not only have to count the votes but the Dead Bodies too.</p>

			<p>The question is put forth, why is this country the most powerful in the world, is always under the threat of blacks rioting whenever they are displeased?  The whites have allowed the blacks to obtain whatever they want by a threat of violence and lawsuits.  By catering to inferior genes, every institution in this country has been on a steady downhill slide.  It is like a cancer that will not stop unless racial degradation is courageously addressed.  This country has allowed itself not to raise/discuss black issues on a reality basis because of white liberals and fear.  The result is a slow steady decline into a twilight zone and a tremendous amount of wasted money and effort.</p>
<p>From Jefferson to Lincoln, those kind of leaders wrestled mightly with the problems blacks would create for future generations.  Presently, instead of dealing with the problem, the problem is left again for future generations.  Now, this country is foolish enough to actually put a black man into the office of being President.  Obama&rsquo;s whole career from Columbia to Harvard was based entirely on affirmative action not on merit.  His grades at Columbia were below average or worse.  They needed a token black at Harvard.  He did not produce a single article while on Law Review.  He was never a full fledged law professor contrary to news articles.  He will not release his birth certificate even under a threat of a lawsuit.  He will not release his state and federal voting records.  If this country caters to inferiority, you will get inferiority.  And we will all pay the price.  </p>

			<p>Is this really where we are?  If Obama wins, riots; if he loses, riots. And we are dealing with the presidency of the United States here! A president who happens to be black may not be harmful to the country; in fact, it could even be a good thing, if he or she had the right vision.  But Obama is a black president, and he promises to be ruinous, in so many ways, for this once great country. </p>
<p>I urge whites, even white supporters of Obama&rsquo;s, to arm themselves and be prepared to defend themselves if our country really is so unfortunate as to suffer the violence being predicted. </p>

			<p>As sure as my skin is White, if BHO loses - blacks will be ready to fight. America is becoming 3rd world in nature, thanks to multiculturalism and non-White foreign immigrantion. Then again, if BHO wins - many blacks will still verbally intimidate and physically attack Whites out of their basic need to be themselves; uncivil, savage, racist cowards&hellip;the old &#8220;in yo face&#8221; mantra of the uneducated thugs will manifest nationally.<br>

<p>The whole intimidation line is OLD.  Blacks ARE NOT intimidated by a police presence.  &#8220;Incite&#8221; would have been a more appropriate word.  We will be cleaning and readying our guns this weekend.<br>

			<p>I suspect it won&rsquo;t be just blacks rioting but also the liberal nutjobs.  I predict McCain will win and they&rsquo;ll be widespread violence.  I&rsquo;m so concerned about it I purchased a revolver last week for security.  It&rsquo;s the first handgun I&rsquo;ve owned in my life.  I urge everyone, no matter what your feelings are for McCain to vote for him.  This is the last stand for the 60s radical Marxists.  Let&rsquo;s make sure they go out not with a bang but a whimper.</p>

<p>Really, Mr. Shelton? Do we have any recent historical examples by which to identify any Asian, Hispanic, or American Indian groups as &#8220;getting angry&#8221; due to &#8220;voting irregularities&#8221; and causing public mayhem as a result? And of course we must not forget those nasty Caucasians. Personally, I don&rsquo;t quite remember the last time white mobs roamed the streets of America smashing store windows, walking off with television sets and other &#8220;free&#8221; merchandise, and setting fire to local businesses all as a response to feeling &#8220;disenfranchised.&#8221;  </p>

			<p>I implore all of my fellow AmRen readers to be prepared for what is coming.  If you do not already have a gun, buy one.  Go to the grocery store the weekend before the election and buy enough food and supplies so that you don&rsquo;t have to leave the house for a couple of weeks if need be.  Make sure your family is inside and the doors are locked before election results start coming in.  If you live in an urban area, don&rsquo;t leave the house for any reason.  Lay low and let the blacks and riot cops fight it out.  If you live in a suburban area, talk to your neighbors and be prepared to defend your turf if necessary - the cops will be too busy keeping the urban areas under control to come to your rescue.  </p>

			<p>So everytime someone loses now, it means it was stolen from him or her. Good Grief. </p>
<p>Oh wait, that is only if it is a Democrat that loses, it is stolen. Of course, Republicans SHOULD lose and Democrats can NEVER LOSE, so it has to be stolen from them.</p>

This will be an opportunity for people who want to commit mischief.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that above set of remarks from a black Republican candidate and columnist certainly confirms the worst fears and frustrations of most AR regulars, I must say!</p>
<p>Coming honestly from &#8220;one of their own,&#8221; no matter how measured the comments, could not  inspire anything less. </p>
<p>If Comrade BO wins, I suspect that the &#8220;mischief&#8221; so-called by: blacks, nonwhites, and Reds will be nothing less then unrestrained barbarism. In triumph, all those who hold some absurd to obscene &#8220;grudge,&#8221; will feel that the time to act on their twisted irrationalities has come; cities will be in flames again and decent, normal, white people (those who neither look or think like the denizens of Bedlam or Brandise) will be set upon. </p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8221; they &#8220;Can&#8221; and yes they will most probably, since this will be the &#8220;Superbowl&#8221; victory of the teams Multi Cult and Mau Mau over the &#8220;Horrid Honkies&#8221; and &#8220;Evil Elephants.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ironically, I think that while there will be some &#8220;mischief&#8221; should Saint BO lose this election, it will be much more restrained in the nonwhite communities, but more intensified among young to extendedly immature &#8220;enlightened whites.&#8221; </p>
<p>Nonwhites tend to be a bit &#8220;explosive,&#8221; to say the least, when disappointed; however, not without the augmenting paranoid fatalism that comes within an unrealistically inflated &#8220;equality&#8221; construct based on &#8220;racist&#8221; reality never meeting utopian outcomes.  </p>
<p>Or put another way, they know deep down, they cannot wake up white tomorrow regardless of who is president or how many filthy white traitors they rut with in their lifetimes.</p>
<p>On the other hand,mischief.&rsquo;&#8221; (often acting in terms of a self-fulfilling-prophecy of &#8220;progressive white privilege&#8221;) white: Marxist, Multi Cultists, and other wretched rainbow idiots, tend to have the most deranged and feckless points of view. Because they want a Utopian States of America at any cost, it becomes a point of obsessive apoplexy when it is denied to them; just look at how they still view the elections of 2000 and 2004, if you do not believe me here. It is the angry to hysterically uncontrolled tantrums of the &#8220;enlightened&#8221;  infantile, that one is subjected to. </p>
<p>Here, the &#8220;clever&#8221; and &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; terms tolerance and anarchy of a &#8220;classroom,&#8221;combine to make a psychedelic stew of a fantasized &#8220;paradise&#8221; lost; that is where the roots, of domestic Red terrorists and Johnny Jihad activities germinate and then blossom.</p>
<p>As always, God Help us all!<br>

			<p>The police will not do or lift a finger to stop any BLACK riots or looting like in New Orleans.  What the police will do nationwide will be to kick in the doors of WHITE people to confiscate their legally owned firearms so the BLACKS can pillage WHITE neighborhoods in safety.  If the police try this I will resist and surrender my life to the cause of liberty and freedom.  Someone has to die for his country and let it start with me.  In the past American men died so I could live in freedom so its now my turn to repay that debt.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I think it is a big deal  &mdash;  you got an African-American running and [a] woman running,&rdquo; he added, in reference to Obama and GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. &ldquo;Whoever wins it, it will be a national event. We will have more officers on the street in anticipation that things may go south.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
I get it. They&rsquo;re suggesting that if Sarah Palin doesn&rsquo;t get to be vice-President, women will go on a rampage of arson, looting, sniping and dragging men out of their cars and beating and castrating them.  If she wins they will go on a celebratory rampage of the same order; less the beating and castrating.<br>
They really want us to believe that it&rsquo;s not because of the anticipated Black rampaging.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Sen. Obama (Ill.), the Democratic nominee for president, has seen his lead over rival Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) grow in recent weeks, prompting speculation that there could be a violent backlash if he loses unexpectedly.&#8221;</p>
<p>A quick second point, regarding this nonsense.</p>
<p>The &#8220;lead&#8221; that Comrade BO &#8220;holds&#8221; is very dependent and erratic, when the poll in question or its demographics are considered. </p>
<p>Right now the polls show that Comrade BO is either going to win by as much as 52% over No Brains the &#8220;White&#8221; Traitor&rsquo;s 38%; or that this presidential race is in a near deadlock: something like 46% for BO over No Brains&rsquo; 44%? There are still two weeks to go and McNobrains, probably has it? </p>
<p>I am far from pleased either way; but in the end, I must encourage all rational racial realists to vote for McNobrains. </p>
<p>Yes, he is a puddle of dog diarrhea, but he is better then Comrade BO. </p>
<p>Comrade BO is a potential understudy &#8220;president&#8221; who will likely be dominated by his vice-presidential pick; Comrade Biden makes clear these views of his and others, when he points out that &#8220;somewhere&#8221; on the earth, a test of reality will be awaiting Comrade BO, if elected.  The White House might have a place for an  understudy, but that one should be in the vice-president&rsquo;s chair, not the Commander-In-Chief&rsquo;s!</p>
<p>Just something to think about,</p>

			<p>During and after the L.A. riots, all across the country white people were pulled from their cars and beaten by blacks.  The reason for it was because the word was out nationwide that the  time had come for the black uprising, the one blacks have been threatening all along.  Their moment was finally upon them.  The bruthas were in full battle mode taking it to whitey with the intent of putting him in his place and taking over.  They knew that all they had to do was keep fighting and the country was theirs.</p>
<p>That they were severely outnumbered, outgunned, outsmarted, and they had access to absolutely no heavy armaments, weren&rsquo;t even considerations, but they were certain of victory, as they are right now.  I mean, the bruthas are always ready.  Cuz dey bad.  Listen to their rap music and their black talk stations carry on about taking over, getting out from under all the oppression and exploitation, and how the white racism is worst of all.    They have much wisdom laying out the reasons why they&rsquo;ll be the overlords of a new America, and it&rsquo;s plain they just can&rsquo;t wait to get started.</p>
<p>Besides the bruthas, Carville isn&rsquo;t the only one threatening black uprisings throughout the country.  Many of the disgusting white talking heads in the leftist media are insinuating the very same thing.  And, of course, the black affirmative action columnists will make it known also that blacks ain&rsquo;t gonna stand for a brutha bein&rsquo; cheated out of the presidency by some rotten honkey trick.  No siree.  No more of that.  I mean, theys suffered enough already and it continues on from day to day. There will be a price to pay.  So get scared all you white effeminates dis warning is for you.  If you know whut&rsquo;s good for you you will work toward gettin&rsquo; the brutha elected to prevent gettin&rsquo; your buns stomped and your neighborhoods burnt to the ground.</p>
<p>During the LA riots, the fools burnt down their own neighborhoods, looted all the stores, threatened the Korean shopkeepers there with death, and in response the Koreans formed a quick like-minded milita, positioning themselves on rooftops firing at potential looters and arsonists below.</p>
<p>Though they attacked Korean, white, and Hispanic people, and beat them senseless, they stayed within the confines of their neighborhoods.  Eventually a combination of burning themselves out and the arrival of the National Guard quelled the situation down considerably.</p>
<p>The attacks across the country beating whites, however, were still continuing.  When it became apparent there wouldn&rsquo;t be a black march in full battle gear from L.A. to New York, leaving defeated whites in their wake, the retards in the other cities backed off as well. Because they couldn&rsquo;t sustain the momentum that they were certain would lead them to victory over whitey, they crawled back into their ratholes, and resumed their whining about racism.</p>
<p>So what is in store for the country and whites this time if Obama loses?  Will this next riot be a spontaneous national one, not confined to a relatively small area like South Central L.A.?  And if it is a national riot, what will be the goal of the black rioters?  This time will they march into suburban  neighborhoods they determine are non-Obama supporters, burning, looting and attacking whites?  Will there be feral gangs as in N.O. after Katrina, armed with AK47&rsquo;s, and snipers throughout the urban areas?  Will there be black snipers on the overpasses on the interstate systems, picking off white drivers as they drive under?  Will there be roving packs of armed blacks looking for anybody white to make &#8220;them pay,&#8221; for yet another injustice suffered by the black man.  You know, the kind of suffering Jeremiah Wright, Obama, Jesse, Al, Malcom X, Farrakhan, and dozens of other black leaders, say they&rsquo;ve been enduring from whites all these years, holding them back from scoring high on tests and keeping them down so they can&rsquo;t get an education or a job.</p>
<p>And will the white radical, David Swanson, help the blacks riot, burn and kill?  He&rsquo;s the leftist radical who mentioned in another article that the leftist radicals intended to inundate Washington if McCain wins and added that:</p>
<p>&#8220;If your television declares John McCain the president elect on the evening of November 4th, your television will be lying. You should immediately pick up your pre-packed bags and head straight to the White House in Washington, D.C., which we will surround and shut down until this attempt at a third illegitimate presidency is reversed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may be there for days or weeks or months. But we must be there. We must be there by the millions. We must show each other, and the nation, and the world that we have had enough, that we will not stand for one more stolen election, that we will not give in to fear, lies, theft, and intimidation. If they choose to attack our nonviolent gathering of citizens, let them do it right in front of George W. Bush&rsquo;s White House with the world&rsquo;s media watching. We will not back down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking this additional fanatacism into account, is it possible that the police and National Guard will have their hands so full they can&rsquo;t possibly protect even ten per cent of the whites in a national riot?  Will the riots turn into an uprising with the blacks and their leftist co-criminals looting the stores for food and ammunition?</p>
<p>One poster on here laughed at us and said we would be too cowardly to defend ourselves and that our best bet would be to go inside, lock our doors and hide somewhere with the door barracaded with whatever we could find.</p>
<p>So, if McCain wins and these very possible events do occur, what would be the best defensive action to take to save yourselves, your friends, and your loved ones?  Have you thought about it at all?</p>

<p>If Obama losses the traitors in the media are already calling it &#8220;unrest&#8221;. (as evidenced in the headline above) What kind of dictionary are these liberal media morons using?!?!?! </p>

			<p><b>10 Things To Do Before The Election:</b></p>
<p>1.  Clean your rifle.</p>
<p>2.  Clean your handgun.</p>
<p>3.  Sharpen your knives.</p>
<p>4.  Make sure everyone in your household knows how and when to use the items in  1, 2, and 3 above.</p>
<p>5.  Lay in stocks of water purification supplies, ammo, any required medicines, and food in that order. </p>
<p>6.  Make sure your vehicles&rsquo; gas tanks are always at least half full.</p>
<p>7.  Map out escape routes from the cities to your SAFE area (Selected Area For Evasion). <br>
     Try to pick routes away from major traffic arteries.</p>
<p>8.  If possible, preposition supplies from #5 at your SAFE area.</p>
<p>9.  Since the trend is to burning property during riots, buy several inexpensive fire extinguishers.</p>
<p>10. KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT about your preparations.</p>

			<p>One can only hope that they do in fact riot.</p>
<p>Our country has some very deep problems that have, at the root, the fact that a sizable portion of the white population are delusional race traitors.  They have convinced themselves that they are no longer white, hate other whites and are now part of the black/minority/world community and now actively and aggressively seek to harm other whites and their families.  Some go so far as to seek our extermination, thinking they will join with blacks afterward.  They are in for a rude awakening.</p>
<p>What we need is for McCain to win and for there to be mass rioting of blacks in every city in the nation with massive amounts of violence towards whites, brutally put down by our armed forces.  Most of the victims will be liberals because that is who is easily available&hellip;.who lives nearby.</p>
<p>Such a thing on a large scale could turn liberals against blacks by showing them what blacks REALLY think of them and what they intend.</p>
<p>Without liberals, blacks will quickly become disempowered.  And then, at last, something can be done about the massive social problem they have become&hellip;..real, and effective strategies based on the REALITIES of what they are.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Public safety officials said in interviews with The Hill that the election, which will end with either the nation&rsquo;s first black president or its first female vice president, demanded a stronger police presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If [Obama] is elected, like with sports championships, people may go out and riot,&rdquo; said Bob Parks, an online columnist and black Republican candidate for state representative in Massachusetts. &ldquo;If Barack Obama loses there will be another large group of people who will assume the election was stolen from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Um, somehow I think it will be the same group of people, Bob.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s also implied that it&rsquo;s not just the possibility of the first black POTUS that may inspire riots but the possibility of the first female VPOTUS. Does this mean that if Sarah becomes VP, there will be riots like we see so often in Alaskan basketball &#8216;sports championships,&rsquo; and if she loses, there will be rioting white women in beehive hair who assume the election was stolen from her?</p>
<p>What was the point of including Sarah as &#8216;historical,&rsquo; in the context of riot potential, which we know is all about blacks and all about Obama?</p>
<p>And is there no end to the savagery that Americans are willing to excuse from feral blacks?</p>

These are very dark times ahead for us people of &#8220;non color&#8221;.One of the things that bothers me the most though is the liberal idiot elitist voting him into office will retreat to their gated,alarmed,and security protected fortresses.The police will be there in force to protect them,while they will probably abandon less affluent neighborhoods.So we &#8220;common folk&#8221; will have to fend for ourselves&hellip;.Good luck to everyone and as always Teach Your Children Well.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Democratic strategists and advocates for black voters say they understand officers wanting to keep the peace, but caution that excessive police presence could intimidate voters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intimidate voters? You mean, like they were &#8220;intimidated&#8221; by a noose hanging from the back of a Pick Up Truck in Jena, La.?<br>
And God forbid their behavior should give the rest of the country the impression we live in a Police State.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Oakland police last faced big riots in 2003 when the Raiders lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the Super Bowl. Officials are bracing themselves in case residents of Oakland take Obama&rsquo;s loss badly.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they responded to a Football game?!?!<br>
So then what we can expect from the Election either way will make the L.A.Riots look like a Sunday Picnic.<br>
Oh, and don&rsquo;t you like the use of the word &#8220;residents&#8221; in the above quote?</p>
<p>&#8220;Carville said earlier this month that &ldquo;it would be very, very, very dramatic out there&rdquo; if Obama lost, a statement some commentators interpreted as predicting riots.&#8221;</p>
<p>It should read &#8220;a statement most readers interpreted as inciting riots.&#8221;<br>
But we know why it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>As far as James Carville goes, he can be dismissed quickly by quoting what they Ancient Greeks used to say about people like him - &#8220;Ugly face, Ugly soul.&#8221; The words, the thoughts, the actions, simply follow.</p>
<p>And as far as Blacks rioting - there&rsquo;s a specific term in psychology for the behavior associated with burning and looting ones own neighborhood, but I don&rsquo;t recall it.<br>
Either way I don&rsquo;t think Blacks have graduated much from this pattern of what is ultimately self-destructive behavior. But that is not to say they won&rsquo;t be destructive toward us.  And that&rsquo;s all I care about. So, take the time you have now to Be Prepared!</p>

<p>Yeah, right.  McCain supporters - like retirees in San Diego and insurance agents in Peoria - are going to riot if their guy loses.  Only blacks riot.</p>
<p>What the media describes as a white riot always ends up being two or three white guys with a ball bat, or a handful of middle-aged people shoving.</p>
<p>Only blacks riot.  The term &#8220;race riot&#8221; is a misnomer - what is really meant by that term is &#8220;black riot&#8221;.  In this country, there isn&rsquo;t any other kind.</p>

			<p>Look rioting by blacks has nothing to do with any real grievances they might have.  They use rioting and looting as an excuse to get that new TV.  This is just going to be another one of those stupid excuses and as long as the people in charge, let them get away with it, they are going to do it every time they feel they&rsquo;ve been deprived or oppressed. Of course, that&rsquo;s pretty much everyday now. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tribal mentality and nothing else.  I know it sounds hokey but you can take the lion out of the jungle but you can&rsquo;t take the jungle out of the lion, no matter how much you&rsquo;ve tried to domesticate him or her.  150 years after freeing them, giving them housing, food, clothing, jobs, contracts, political position and money has done nothing to suppress those tribal instincts.  It&rsquo;s in the genes and nothing more.</p>
<p>I hate to see it happen again. I&rsquo;ve seen up close the damage that they do.  I saw it when I was kid in Baltimore in the 60&rsquo;s.  We watched National Guardsmen stand around with unloaded weapons and watch the blacks destroy stores and businesses.  Yet the people who lived in Littly Italy and Canton, who had restaurants and stores, made it known that should the blacks even attempt to come in to their neighborhoods and try to destroy what they had built over the years, they were ready for them.  When the looting and rioting was over, not one single store, restaurant or home was touched in those areas and those people meant it.  They were ready with baseball bats and any other weapon they could get their hands on.</p>
<p>Whether or not Obama wins on November 4th, we are all looking at a mirror image of all those African countries where rioting and violence is rampant.  </p>

			<p>Robert Kelly, great post as always.</p>
<p>I agree the election riots will be a lot worse mainly because Obama is surrounded by his communist advisors and all the tax payer funded groups like ACORN etc.</p>
<p>The white communist and leftists of Los Angeles did a great deal of planning, instigating and preparation for months before the verdict and riot.</p>
<p>The downtown flashpoint was the communist bookstore just blocks from city hall and police headquarters.  They had vans and pick up trucks full of bricks for throwing.</p>
<p>The major instigator was of course, as usual a white billionaire communist, Stanley Sheinbaum.  Commie economics professor Sheinbaum married one of Jack Warner&rsquo;s daughters and has used her inheritance to promote the destruction of America and its white population ever since.</p>
<p>Sheinbaum succeeded in getting himself appointed head of the police commission.  He used his office to persecute white officers and the white police chief. He continually met with the black community and promised to rid the force of white officers and its white chief.</p>
<p>Picture this:  On the first after noon of the riots a thin blue line of police guarded the entrance to police headquarters.  They faced a howling mob of thousands.  The mob was well supplied with  bricks from the communist book store.  They were already pillaging city hall and the county building.</p>
<p>And what was Stanley Sheinbaum doing?  He stood behind that line of officers who risked their lives.  And what did he say?  He continually repeated.  Do not shoot.  Do not hit anyone with a baton.  If you hurt any protestor I will have your badge.  You will be sued in civil court.  You will lose everything you have.<br>
Do not resist.</p>
<p>After a few hours, a police caravan escorted Stanley Sheinbaum home, not to his house in LA, but to his house in Malibu which was totally safe from the rioters. He stayed home safe in Malibu for the next week while the police battled his beloved blacks.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he castigated the white police chief for not stopping the riot the first afternoon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 56 people died, thousands were injured, the city closed down for a week, and billions of dollars of damage was done.</p>
<p>This time, think Lenin and his 1917 rent a mob.  It probably will not happen, but the blacks and communists are hoping and planning.</p>
<p>Remember, there are many more affirmative action black police, chiefs, deputy chiefs, fire department managers and other high ranking officials than in 1992.  The black civil servants of Los Angeles totally sided with the rioters in the King riots.  </p>

			<p>Notice how the only assumptions that are made in the article are that (a) Many blacks may not get to vote because of what the writer implies would be &ldquo;voter suppression,&rdquo; and (b) If Obama loses, many Democrats will assume the election was &ldquo;stolen from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This in an election where Barack Hussein has raised, as of today, $603 million, much of it through bending and probably outright breaking of the election financing laws; and where the ACORN organization, sworn to get Obama elected by hook or crook, has been conducting illegal voter registration activities in as many as 15 states (that we know about so far). The election may be stolen all right, but not by White Republicans.</p>
<p>Posted by Wayne Engle at 6:38 PM on October 22 </p>
<p>&gt; Everyone knows that I am a long time Amren poster who supports the aims of Amren and its community.  However, check the facts on this one.  It turns out that ACORN has always checked for forged registrations by their workers because they are paid for numbers registered.  In fact, I recall the same issue last election.  No one would know anything about this if ACORN hadn&rsquo;t broke the news about the forgeries.  They routinely check and remove forged or fraudulent registrations themselves.  This story is a red herring that the McCain campaign is only embarassing itself with.  They have plenty of real reasons to argue for not voting the Dem ticket without false ones.  Flogging non-starters like this only serves to confirm our adversaries in their own feelings of righteousness.</p>
<p>In the mean time, my wife and I moved.  We are required to re-register to vote when we move.  Surprise, we have received two sets of ballots (Washington has mail balloting).  What do you all think we ought to do?  I bet some would vote twice.  But what I am going to do is contact the officials in Olympis and let them know the mistake.  Because it is the lack of ethics all around that has led to the current state of our nation and society.</p>

			<p> You ever notice that the media sees elections as a sporting entertainment and plays an us against them program while filtering any information that would allow a citizen to make an informed choice.<br>
 I would like to see more third party choices so we can truthfully evauluate the individual canidates and less threats like this article.<br>
 Talk radio,newspapers and television love to promote elections as entertainment when in reality they are the last chance for change in our country and we watch them and cheer for one side or the other but the best canidates don&rsquo;t get through because they are not with super-bowl quality parties.</p>

			<p>This all started 47 years ago when a black man from deepest, darkest Africa came to America and impregnated a naive white lady, Ann Dunham.  Don&rsquo;t forget that at the same time BHO Sr. left behind in Kenya a pregnant wife Kezia and their infant son.  Kezia and her 4 children now live on welfare in Bracknell, England.</p>
<p>&#8220;As his son Senator Obama has said, &#8216;The Kennedys decided: &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to do an airlift. We&rsquo;re going to go to Africa and start bringing young Africans over to this country and give them scholarships to study so they can learn what a wonderful country America is. This young man named Barack Obama [Sr.] got one of those tickets and came over to this country.&#8221;&rsquo;  An article by Michael Dobbs in The Washington Post, however, states that the Kennedy family did not become associated with the educational airlift until 1960, a year after Obama Sr. was studying in the United States. Initial financial supporters of the program included Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, Jackie Robinson, and Elizabeth Mooney Kirk, a literacy advocate who provided most of the financial support for Obama Sr.&rsquo;s early years in the United States, according to the Tom Mboya archives at Stanford University.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey, white people, the election of BHO Jr. will be the part where they rub your faces in it.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve always been curious about how these &#8220;protests&#8221; blacks indulge in - whether over alleged police misconduct, a jury decision they dislike, the outcome of a sports event, or now possibly the result of a Presidential election - always tend to focus on the looting of stores selling liquor or consumer electronics.</p>

			<p>Now well into old-farthood, I never cease to be amazed at the explanations for black failure, incapacity, and criminality.  Of course, there&rsquo;s really only one permissible explanation, which is white racism and the corresponding &#8220;lack of opportunity for blacks.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s now been the official explanation for over fifty years.</p>
<p>Just how long can this broken record be played?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how the threat of riots is greeted with dejected resignation rather than outrage and firm threats by enforcement officials directed at the perpetrators, as though rioting, destruction of property, and murderous assaults on whites are somehow their due.</p>
<p>Imagine if whites threatened to invade black neighborhoods in response to well-documented reports of voter fraud by blacks.  Those actually doing so would be arrested immediately and find themselves doing hard time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I was in a large gun shop a couple of weeks ago.  Despite the market crash and economic uncertainty, from the lines at the counters one would have thought that they were giving guns away. </p>

			<p>The focal point for the violence will probably start in Chicago&rsquo;s Grant Park where Obama is planning his victory celebration.  I hope that place is packed with Hollywood celebrities and politicians along with Oprah, Murtha and Dean when the big screen monitor announces John McCain the winner.  Watch the fun begin.</p>

			<p>Honestly, i think there will be pockets of this. However, my real fear is more sinister. I&rsquo;m watching for an orange, or rose revolution type thing. Where they refuse to accept the loss,, have crowds of Obamabots block the shut down the capitol or something,, the media would be utterly in their corner,,, then imagine the EU, Mexico, the UN, Canada, etc,, starts recognizing Obama as the true winner,, then power sharing negotiation begins.</p>
<p>Obama appeals for calm (but not an end to the &ldquo;protest&rdquo;)and to &ldquo;let the system work&rdquo;,<br>
Bush won&rsquo;t have the stomach to disperse them or oppose them.</p>
<p>This will be the third loss perceived by them as theft. And Obama isnt Kerry or Gore,, Obama is a cult leader. They have no idea whatsoever they could lose.</p>
<p>The day will come that they try to seize power like in those color revolutions Soros was eyeballs deep in. Do not think it cant happen here. This would be in line with the nationalization of banks,,, Calls by the EU to end capitalism, etc,,, this is their big chance and i think they know it.<br>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s whole career from Columbia to Harvard was based entirely on affirmative action not on merit. His grades at Columbia were below average or worse. They needed a token black at Harvard. He did not produce a single article while on Law Review. He was never a full fledged law professor contrary to news articles. He will not release his birth certificate even under a threat of a lawsuit. He will not release his state and federal voting records. If this country caters to inferiority, you will get inferiority. And we will all pay the price. <br>
____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>He is our first affirmative action president.  What were his SAT scores?  His LSAT scores?  How did he get into Columbia and Harvard?  What did he do on Law Review, besides getting elected president because he was black and glibe?  And, did he even pass the Illinois Bar exam?  From what I have heard, his wife never did.</p>

			<p>How Obama raises his money.</p>
<p>Woman&rsquo;s Credit Card Charged $175,000 to Obama </p>
<p>Washington Post reporter Matthew Mosk has found a doozy of a story about the Obama campaign. </p>
<p>Apparently Mary Biskup&rsquo;s credit card was charged $175,000 from the Obama campaign. She said she never donated anything. (And yes, she must have awfully good credit.)</p>
<p>The campaign caught the error and refunded the money. Mosk published a quote from an Obama spokesman commending themselves for doing so and making sure everyone knows &#8220;no organization is protected from credit card fraud.&#8221;</p>
<p>This seems to me like a heck of a story. $175,000 is nothing to joke about. It&rsquo;s not like this woman lost a dollar in a pop machine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt this story should be on A1 tomorrow.</p>
<p>Something tells me the Washington Post isn&rsquo;t going to move this story off their blog page though. </p>

<p>Any rioters who come to the suburbs are in grave danger from people who actually have assets to lose.  Potential rioters probably know this and will likely stick to their own areas where they can blend in with massive groups of people.</p>

			<p>    To soviet republic of new jersey. Yes, you are correct.   my wife and I were surrounded by 2 car loads of blacks in a parking lot outside Krogers in Brentwood TN. Both cars simultaneously blocked our vehicle by pulling in front of and behind our car prohibiting any escape. Because of my ancestry of American revolutionist and Southern Confederate cavalry officers I single handidly left my vehicle and confronted this mob. Fortunatly cooler heads prevailed by my wife dialing police on her cell phone. The attackers fled at the sound of police. I have often thought of this engagement. First, by the co-ordinated assault by these black gentlemen that demonstrated a military tactic. </p>

<p>Obama admitted to goofing off during his second half of high school, doping and skipping classes.  How is it then that he got admitted into an ivy league undergrad school like Columbia?  The valedictorian of my high school class - she had a 3.9 GPA in a hard curriculum, three successful AP tests earning college credit before graduation, NHS, activities galore, two sports, couldn&rsquo;t get into any ivy league school, much less Duke and Stanford, two borderline-ivy institutions?  Obama wasn&rsquo;t exactly a stellar undergrad at Columbia, but yet, after that and two years of Chicagograd &#8220;community organizing,&#8221; he got into the most prestigious law school in the country, Harvard, again ivy league.  If you weren&rsquo;t the best undergrad student, even in the ivies, would you get into Harvard Law?</p>
<p>Ironically, my class&rsquo;s valedictorian is now living and working in Chicago.</p>
<p>As for Michelle Obama, how is it that whatever she does for the University of Chicago Hospital is so valuable that (1) It was worth $100G salary to begin with, and (2) That it tripled when Obama won U.S. Senator?  Why does the University of Chicago play so heavily into the Obama biography, including Bill Ayers.   Yet, The UofC practically ran Prof. John Lott out on a rail.</p>
<p>Summary:  The Ivy League is only for two kinds of people:  (1) White people with connections.  (2) Favored minorities.</p>

<p>During the Rodney King riots of 1992 in LA:  &#8220;..Of those arrested, about 42% were African-American, 44% Latino, 9% White, and 2% other&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Why would hispanics let blacks have all the fun?  Hispanics wanted to get their &#8216;fair&rsquo; share of the spoils during the LA riots when they saw blacks setting fires, smashing windows and carrying out TVs, liquor, diapers, tires and other &#8216;luxury&rsquo; items.  I doubt even one hispanic knew who rodney king was.</p>
<p>One good thing did come out of those riots:  The Los Angeles Times was attacked and looted. </p>
<p>Of course, the situation is different now in LA  &mdash;  the hispanics have ethnically cleansed the blacks from many of their historic rioting areas. In their place are vicious, violent, highly armed illegal immigrant gangs from mexico and central america  &mdash;  all protected by a sanctuary city policy, a race-centric mayor, and Special Order 40, which according to Judical Watch:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;prohibits police officers from &#8216;initiat(ing) police action with the objective of discovering the alien status of a person.&rsquo; . .. After Judicial Watch filed a taxpayer lawsuit, ACLU lawyers intervened for illegal aliens to help defend the Special Order 40 sanctuary policy&hellip;Special Order 40 is an illegal policy that places the citizens of Los Angeles (and the nation) at risk&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;what would be the best defensive action to take to save yourselves, your friends, and your loved ones? Have you thought about it at all?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Robert Kelly</p>
<p>Yes, I have not only thought about it but started taking action as well. I foresee riots in the future, vicious, unavoidable riots  &mdash;  either election or economy based.</p>
<p>I recently bought two straw-type water purifiers plus a supply of a new type of water purification tablets that are not supposed to taste as vile as the old iodine/chlorine tablets.  DH has re-stocked our ammo supply for the shotguns and I am in the process of buying a 30-day supply of freeze-dried food.  Don&rsquo;t forget your animals  &mdash;  my police dog/pitbull mix is a line of defense as well.</p>
<p>I NEVER thought I&rsquo;d be preparing myself and my family like a nutty (were they nutty?) survivalist in a barricaded compound in Idaho. </p>
<p>Is this where multiculturalism has brought us? </p>
<p>Whoever did this to us should suffer the same fate as Mussolini after the Italian people got hold of him  &mdash;  hanged, put on public display, spat at, reviled.</p>

<p>I heard, George W. Bush was rejected by Texas Law School, but went to Yale and Harvard Business school. Is the school of the Longhorns that much harder to get into, than Yale and Harvard? </p>
<p>Keeping this fact in mind, I would suspect you are correct. He probably would not have gotten into Yale and/or Harvard without his father&rsquo;s help. </p>
<p>George W. Bush is smart (well above average), but I think we have another example of &#8216;legacy.&rsquo; </p>
<p>I also think Obama is grossly unqualified for the presidency. He completely lacks experience, and seems naive. He is going to destroy our economy. I am not saying it&rsquo;s true, but I heard a rumor that the average IQ of a Black African in an Ivy League School, is about 116. I don&rsquo;t know if that is true, but if it is, it should be an eye opener (especially if it applies to Obama).</p>
<p><br>
Whatever the case is, we really can&rsquo;t afford an Affirmative Action president. Affirmative Action is harming productivity and effiency in not only industry (through shools), but also potentially our military. It would be sadly ironic, if the federal government lost a civil war, because it picked a top general, solely to fill a racial quota! (i.e. Colin Powell)</p>
<p>Now imagine the consequences of electing a president (Obama), solely because he is Black. Remember, one person can make a difference. Especially if he/she is the President of the U.S.<br>

<p>She wasn&rsquo;t so naive.  She was a communist, her parents were communists and best buddies with Frank Marshall Davis, head of the communist party in Hawaii and she graduated from Mercer High School in Seattle.  The faculty were very hard left and heavily communist and surveiled by the FBI. She spent her high school years taking classes with the communist teachers adn preaching revolution.</p>
<p>The big thing in communist families of that era was to encourage their daughters to marry either black American men or non white foreign students in hopes of fomenting the revolution.</p>
<p>The Dunham&rsquo;s probably had some sort of communist baptism ceremony when Obama was born.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The day will come that they try to seize power like in those color revolutions Soros was eyeballs deep in. Do not think it cant happen here.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my opinion too. I am very familiar with communists, the hard left and revolutionaries.</p>
<p>The communists tried in the 1930&rsquo;s when Roosevelt flooded the federal government and the WPA programs with them. They almost made it when communist front man Henry Wallace became vice president in Roosevelt&rsquo;s 3rd term.  </p>
<p>Only a coalition of southern segregationists and the northern labor unions  prevented the communist take over that would have followed Roosevelt&rsquo;s death had Wallace been vice president for Roosevelt&rsquo;s 4th term.</p>
<p>But the evil northern white working class and the southerners managed to beat the communists at the convention and forced Roosevelt (who was obviously dying of heart disease) to pick Truman instead.</p>
<p>Think what would have happened if communist front man Wallace had become president instead of Truman in the spring of 1945.  </p>
<p>The communists tried  again in the 1960&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s when the Johnson/Nixon administrations flooded the war on poverty programs with a toxic mix of black panthers, black muslims, black felons just out of state prison and young white people from wealthy communist families.</p>
<p>The blacks were the storm troopers assigned the job of intimidating elected officials of the cities who accepted the programs.  The whites were in charge and used the offices to foment revolution.</p>
<p>This attempt at revolution ended in a compromise. The revolution was postponed.  In return, the blacks got affirmative action and massive welfare.  The whites turned 30 amd re joined the elite world of their parents.</p>
<p>But now Soros, Pritzker, Axelrod etc are trying it again with Obama as front man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the standard formula for revolution.  Long, quiet preparation for at least 15 years.  The partnership of wealthy elites with the rent a mob underclass.  The howls for rights and liberties and justice. The whole victimization thing.</p>
<p>Our own founding fathers followed the exact same formula with its committees of correspondence and sons of liberty.  Boston was a flashpoint because subsistence farming was difficult in New England which meant Boston had a critical mass of underemployed working men for the rent a mobs.</p>
<p>The French revolutionaries followed the exact same formula.</p>
<p>75 years later, Napoleon Bonaparte 11 followed the same formula when he became dictator in 1848.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the standard modus operandi for every revolution.  And it could happen here after this election.</p>
<p>Notice that the New York City Council has just voted to change the city charter to allow Mayor Bloomberg a third term.  If Obama gets in and serves 2 termsn, the Democrats will use NYC&rsquo;s allowing Mayors to run for third terms as precedent for changing the constitution to allowe Obama to run for a third term.</p>
<p>And then he will be President for life.</p>

			<p>More information on Obama&rsquo;s communist associates.</p>
<p><br>
(CNSNews.com) – A foundation chaired by Barack Obama that was designed to improve Chicago public schools gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Small Schools Workshop, an organization led by former Weatherman Bill Ayers and by Michael Klonsky, a former chairman of both Students for a Democratic Society and, according to The Washington Post and New York Times, a group called the &ldquo;Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist).&rdquo; <br>
 <br>
&#8220;Ayers and an old comrade from SDS, Mike Klonsky, run the Small Schools Workshop to mentor and provide guidance and technical support to educators seeking to start small schools,&rdquo; The Chicago Tribune reported on Sept. 16, 2001. <br>
 <br>
In a September 6, 1977 article headlined &ldquo;China&rsquo;s Ideal American; U.S. Marxist Gets Red-Carpet Welcome in China,&rdquo; The Washington Post said Klonsky was &ldquo;chairman of the newly organized Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) of the United States of America.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Secretary of State Cyrus Vance got a good reception in Peking last month, but nothing like the red-carpet treatment received by that distinguished representative of the American people, Michael Klonsky,&rdquo; the Post reported, before asking: &ldquo;Michael who?&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
Answering its own question, the Post said: &ldquo;Klonsky, as it turns out, is the chairman of the newly organized Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) of the United States of America, an amalgam of various pro-Peking leftist troops whose memberships are not thought to total more than a few hundred people  &mdash;  if that. Klonsky enjoyed a period of notoriety during the late 1960s when he headed Students for a Democratic Society and, for the first time, brought a radical Communist rhetoric to that New Left organization.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>   Think about it my fellow bloggers. before the Kennedy&rsquo;s and LBJ poured the country full of third worlders and instilled the hate whitey mantra, there was never any threat of a racial war due to an election in the U.S. After the 1965 immigration act, and the 1964 civil rights act, the blueprint was laid for the destruction of America. All those involved committed treason against their country. The Kennedy&rsquo;s make me ashamed of my Irish heritage. Unless something drastic happens to reverse this trend, AMERICA IS DOOMED. From what I see worldwide, our race is doomed. Will we not fight the good fight till the end? </p>

			<p><i>If any of the ignorant liberals who vote for Obama are stupid enough to take to the street in protest with their Black &lsquo;brothers&rsquo;, I can assure you they will get a taste of the irrationality of Black rage &mdash; and unfortunately, many of those Whites will be beaten to death and not understand why.</i></p>
<p>Why unfortunate?</p>
<p><i>Either result, McCain or Obama, there will be civil discontent. People do not acknowledge the fact that radicals come from left and also the right.</i></p>
<p>Uh-huh. Sure. Because as we all know, in &#8216;92 and &#8216;96 Baptists burned down Montgomery and Evangelicals were seen smashing windows and looting stores in Kalamazoo. I even heard that in Eugene a group of nuns pulled a hippie out of his car and beat him nearly to death with rulers.</p>
<p>Just as an aside, for a laugh: can anyone even imagine the mayhem if there was a massive riot of NRA members across the country? Brick and bottles would be unnecessary. </p>
<p><i>I saw it when I was kid in Baltimore in the 60&rsquo;s. We watched National Guardsmen stand around with unloaded weapons and watch the blacks destroy stores and businesses. Yet the people who lived in Littly Italy and Canton&hellip; they were ready for them.</i></p>
<p>I hear ya. I had relatives, uncles of my dad, who stood guard to protect their business in the Ft. McHenry area during those riots. The southside Irish and the Highlandtown Polish didn&rsquo;t tolerate attacks on their turf in those days, nor did they wait for permission to defend it. How do you figure they&rsquo;d fare in our legal system today?</p>
<p><i>Any rioters who come to the suburbs are in grave danger from people who actually have assets to lose.</i></p>
<p>True. Also, I doubt many of these cretins from da &#8216;hood really understand how much more heavily suburbia is armed than they are. Whole lotta duck and deer guns in a whole lotta closets and under a whole lotta beds. Not to mention all the people, like myself, who really do have weaponry and a battle plan ready just in case one day, God forbid, the unthinkable should happen and they should find themselves under attack in their own home.</p>
<p>For any anti-gun types who might be rolling their eyes after reading that last paragraph, answer me this: what are the odds of you waking up to find your house on fire, really? The honest answer is &#8220;slim to none.&#8221; But does that mean you shouldn&rsquo;t have a plan and any necessary materials on hand to evacuate you and your family should you be the unfortunate soul to whom it does happen?<br>

			<p>On guns: I have heard several times from different folks that guns sales are spiking. One says a gunsmith has a four month wait on assault type weapons. Another spoke of the lines in the gun shows. And now what I&rsquo;ve read here. Some advice: tell the gunshop saleman why you want a gun  &mdash;  he&rsquo;ll help you fnd what you need; buy a shotgun using buckshot for home protection  &mdash;  with flashlight mounted on it if you can; buy a revolver that can fit in your pocketbook or pant&rsquo;s pocket; buy plenty of ammonition and pratice using and cleaning your firearm  &mdash;  DO NOT WAIT FOR AN EMERGENCY TO TRY IT OUT; a safe for storage is good. Weather permitting I keep a large terrier with me in the car and cell phone. A used Remington pump shotgun is a great place to start. All in all though, the immediate aftermath of the election probably will be anti-climatic. It&rsquo;s the lame-duck session and innaugeration I wonder about. Think of the ball aferward  &mdash;  you think Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s party was a riot  &mdash;  oh boy&hellip;</p>

Now, this country is foolish enough to actually put a black man into the office of being President.</p>
<p>Well said, agree 100% percent. Have people of this nation lost their collective minds?  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all hope there&rsquo;s no BO that comes into the White House. </p>
<p>Pandora&rsquo;s box has been opened for a long time and it doesn&rsquo;t look like there&rsquo;s any solution soon. Nobody seemed to care to implement Lincoln&rsquo;s plan for Black removal to Liberia after his assasination, now we are truly reaping the results. Who would ever thought it would come to this? </p>

			<p>I live in Philadelphia, PA and on a daily basis I&rsquo;ve been getting harassed by blacks on my way home from work. Not one white person would even lend me a hand if they ganged up on me. I truly feel sorry for our country.  </p>

			<p>Does anyone remember Jimmy Breslin, a good journalist from many years ago who turned apologist for Black disfunction?  He was covering some Black gathering that turned violent, AND THE BLACKS SMACKED HIM AND PULLED HIS PANTS DOWN!  He got away without too much physical damage, just some em-bare-ass-ment.  The last I heard of him, he was being charged with racism because he criticized some upstart 22 year old Oriental girl at his newspaper.  Go ahead and suck up to the non-Whites, all you White liberals.  See what it gets you. </p>

			<p>Some more information about George Soros the puppetmaster who pulls Obama&rsquo;s strings.  Soros made 1 billion dollars in one day back in 1992 when he attacked the Bank of England and the British pound.</p>
<p>Mr. Soros is the man who brags about &#8216;bringing down countries&rsquo; with his market manipulations an run of currencies. </p>
<p>THIS is how he made his billions and now he intends to bring down the United States. He has been trying for 8 years to do it and has now nearly succeeded with the complicity of Dodd, Pelosi, Reid, Schumer and Frank to ruin the markets and everyone&rsquo;s investments to frighten us into running into the Marxist Messiah Obama arms for &#8216;protection&rsquo; and &#8216;salvation&rsquo;. </p>
<p>The very ones they are herding everyone to are the ones responsible for the mess. Look to Soros for the market manipulation. Key is &#8216;short selling&rsquo; which started it all. <br>
Everything you hear about why this happened is bogus. When President Bush suspended short selling ( only briefly, should be permanent until things settle) the Soros consortium ran to create a new Hedge fund so they could continue to effect the market manipulation. We are being manipulated and scuppered into leaving our countries values and free markets and running willynilly like scared children into the jaws of evil incarnate. </p>

			<p>The police will not do or lift a finger to stop any BLACK riots or looting like in New Orleans. What the police will do nationwide will be to kick in the doors of WHITE people to confiscate their legally owned firearms so the BLACKS can pillage WHITE neighborhoods in safety. If the police try this I will resist and surrender my life to the cause of liberty and freedom. Someone has to die for his country and let it start with me. In the past American men died so I could live in freedom so its now my turn to repay that debt.</p>

<p>I doubt there are many of us who don&rsquo;t identify with the above post.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how I feel. But at the same time, it makes me sick to my stomach to think that this is exactly what they want.  Now, as far as the Police, I know for a fact that it&rsquo;s not going to be smooth sailing to get each and every Officer in line.  There have already been problems, and a few Officers have already spoken up, but the powers that be have silenced them. <br>
I&rsquo;m not saying that White Police Officers are concerned about us. Though I know there are certainly some, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to speculate on exactly how many.  No. What I&rsquo;m saying is that I know for a fact that White Officers are thinking about getting killed themselves - OFF DUTY!<br>
After all, do you think a Rioter knows the difference between your average White person, and an Off-duty Police Officer?  And if they kill Police Officers, then Police Officers will, well, you know how Policemen behave when one of their own is killed, on duty or off.</p>

			<p>  &#8220;I just returned from Kenya, and people there actually think that if Obama is elected, it will open the door for Kenyans to immigrate to the US for free with no problems or hassles. They worship Obama as if he were god incarnate. It is tragic.&#8221;<br>

<p><br>
  Then there&rsquo;s going to be a whole lot of disappointment if Obama does get elected (and it sure looks that way).   </p>
<p>They sound like just like those &#8220;cargo cults&#8221; in New Guinea, expecting a fleet of airplanes to arrive dropping all sorts of wonderful goodies on them from the sky.  Well, with Obama in the White House or not,  that&rsquo;s not going to happen. Obama&rsquo;s not going to  be able give everyone in Kenya a new bicycle!  When those fleets of planes fail to show up, there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of anger and bitterness.  Perhaps it will be directed at Obama.  Or more likely it will be explained by saying the White Man still  keeps Obama on a chain and won&rsquo;t allow him  to help his brothers. Ah yes, it&rsquo;ll always be Whitey&rsquo;s fault. Just more hate for America when the goodies don&rsquo;t arrive.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;This all started 47 years ago when a black man from deepest, darkest Africa came to America and impregnated a naive white lady, Ann Dunham. &ldquo;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>A naive white lady?  That makes her sound more like an innocent victim who was taken advantage of.  Someone who just didn&rsquo;t understand.   </p>
<p>Miss Dunham was a ditsy white girl, a teenager (not a lady) with an interest in non-white men (and only non-whites).  She was, as I understand it,  only 17 at the time   &mdash;    maybe even 16 at the time of conception(?).  And was she even married to him (at that time)?   Furthermore, he was already married to another wife in Kenya, so the &#8220;marriage&#8221;  here was illegal anyway. </p>
<p>Sounds to me like he should have been arrested for statutory rape.  And for bigamy.   </p>
<p>Oh, and her parents stood by and ALLOWED all of this?</p>
