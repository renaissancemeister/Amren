<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-politics/20081027/Returning.to.Blue.Roots/">Voting Question: Pocketbooks vs. Racial Issues</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, October 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The campaign signs Gerald Skaggs has strung to his fence and flagpole &mdash; &#8221;Had Enough? Vote Democrat&#8221; &mdash; prompt passers-by on U.S. 60 to stop and talk. Sometimes, a bit too much.</p>
<p>After listening to Skaggs argue the merits of Barack Obama&rsquo;s plans for the country, a recent visitor came to a grudging conclusion: &#8220;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to vote for that &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash; .&#8221;</p>
<p>Racial slurs have hardly disappeared here. But many voters in this 95 percent white, decidedly working-class state &mdash; and presumably, elsewhere in America &mdash; are fed up with a lousy economy and current leaders, and Democrats hope they will re-embrace their blue-collar and party roots, swallow any misgivings about race and support a black man for president.</p>
<p>The highway visitor&rsquo;s offhand comment speaks volumes about how bad things have gotten since West Virginia helped elect Republican President Bush in 2000 and 2004.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>National polls showed Democrat Obama and Republican John McCain in a close race until the crisis began in September; then Obama opened up a lead in most surveys. Still, polling shows McCain continuing to lead in West Virginia.</p>
<p>Race remains an issue as the contest plays out house by house.</p>
<p>An AP-Yahoo survey in September showed that one-third of white Democrats in the U.S. agree with at least one negative adjective when applied to blacks, and they&rsquo;re less likely to vote for Obama than those who don&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<p>But AP polling shows Obama is slowly pulling in former supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who trounced him in West Virginia&rsquo;s Democratic primary by more than 2-to-1.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama has taken his slight surge seriously enough to sink advertising money into West Virginia, and he sent running mate Joe Biden to Charleston last Friday. But he has not set foot in the state since a pre-primary visit to Charleston in May.</p>
<p>Ansted, a coal-country town of about 1,500, is a place where blacks and whites mingle on the streets, chat together on the porch of the local convenience store and generally live in harmony &mdash; but their homes tend to be in separate parts of town.</p>
<p>Not everyone is ready to put race aside, says heating contractor Steve Legg, a 55-year-old independent who expects Obama to lose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to say it,&#8221; he admits, &#8220;but most of it&rsquo;s just prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To West Virginians, the decision isn&rsquo;t just about race and the economy. There are concerns about religion, patriotism and veterans&rsquo; care, gun control, taxes and support for organized labor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a Republican and I would vote for McCain,&#8221; DeLeon [Roberto DeLeon, a Masontown barber] says. &#8220;However, I&rsquo;m also a veteran .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and from what I understand, Obama has supported the veterans a lot more than McCain has. But Obama is against gun ownership. The NRA does not endorse Obama. And I&rsquo;m a hunter. I have guns. So I&rsquo;m kind of split there.&#8221;</p>

			<p>How could they be so naive? Take my word for it, Obama does not just plan to tax the wealthy, he will see to it that working class and middle class Americans support low income and unemployed people, more specifically blacks and other minorites.</p>

			<p>Ditto my first post. So many Americans are in the position they are in because they bought the notion of relying on unlimited credit, rather than having some savings and this puts them at the mercy of politicians who promise to &#8220;save them&#8221;. Now why would someone save you, when you are coming from a position of weakness?  </p>

			<p>I fail to see who pocketbook issues and racial issues are not intertwined.  If you lost your job because it was outsourced to Bangalore, then you know that the economy and race are the same issue.  If you&rsquo;re white and a recent CompSci graduate, and you can&rsquo;t get hired because the H1B program has moved Bangalore here, then you know how the economy and race are the same issue.  If affirmative action has ever shut you out of opportunity, then you know how the economy and race are the same issue.</p>
<p>V-Dare had a good blog post several months ago, after the news broke that Sarah Palin&rsquo;s oldest daughter is expecting, and is engaged to the father, both 17 years old.  It thesis is that the future son-in-law will likely succeed in providing for his soon-to-be family because Alaska is one of the few places left where a young white man with a strong back is able to earn a lot of money, mainly because of its far distance from Mexico.  Tell me again that race and economy aren&rsquo;t related.</p>

			<p>A slur is a musical term. What is a racist slur?  And why is such a comment considered racist?  Maybe the person saying it just doesn&rsquo;t like the one commented on!  Being racist means he or she thinks their race is better! Maybe they just don&rsquo;t like the race commented on because of past experiences!  Because they are true feelings.  Racist is a misused, overused term and has lost almost all meaning. </p>

<p>Sorry, but the definition of &#8220;prejudice&#8221; (i.e., an unfavorable opinion or feeling formed beforehand or without knowledge, thought, or reason) doesn&rsquo;t apply to the evaluation of a candidate with established ties to Reverend Wright, Father Pfleger, Bill Ayers, and ACORN.</p>
<p>Citizens of a state that is 95% white (and where I have family roots) should have valid concerns about Obama&rsquo;s ultra-left, Afro-Muslim credentials and intentions.  If by some lapse West Virginia were to contribute to Obama&rsquo;s election, then I would find truth as well as humor in all those &#8220;ignorant hillbilly&#8221; jokes levelled at its people.     </p>

			<p>Whites like these who don&rsquo;t deal with Blacks on a regular basis(or perhaps have never even met one), who almost never follow politics, or even when they do accept the mainstream media at face value, are just the type to fall for the cult of Obama and his alleged &#8220;post-racial&#8221; status, and promises of &#8220;change!&#8221; They aren&rsquo;t politically savvy, and whether they know it or not, have been fed a steady diet of leftists nonsense disguised in films, tv, church sermons, etc. They are ripe for the picking really&hellip; </p>
<p>Twenty years ago, I was basically the same way&hellip;<br>

			<p>People in general still have not perform any kind research on Obama to discover who he really is behind his Axelrod made image.  If they put together his past close radical associations with  Ayers, Wright, Acorn; how he actually got elected into the state and federal legislature; his refusal to disclose a non-fraudulent birth certicate, his legislative voting record, his college grades, his SAT and LSAT scores; and his past pre-presidental interviews fear and worry would arise in people regarding this individual.  His brand of governing is similar to how Africa is governed by blacks.  For starters, read the October 28, 2008 article in the Wall Street Journal titled &#8216;Obama&rsquo;s Redistribution&rsquo; Constitution and Victor Hanson&rsquo;s website.  The Wall Street Journal have consistently warned about Obama from day one.  How Obama work the crowds is similar how it is done in Africa   &mdash;   on an emotional level without any substance.   </p>

			<p>These folksy local endorsements and much publicized superficial &#8220;celebrity&#8221; endorsements like Colin Powell&rsquo;s only magnify the disconnect from the reality that NO LEGITIMATE OPINION LEADER OF INTEGRITY can vouch for Hussein&rsquo;s background or fitness for office- it is so bad that his wife had to &#8220;endorse&#8221; him at the Democratic convention, along with Biden Kennedy and Clinton who just went along because he was in their party.</p>
<p>Who else does Hussein have? Ayers, Wright, Rezko, Rashid Khalidi. </p>
<p>The WV guy just sounds so brainwashed by the crowd screaming he wants whats behind door #3, instead of taking the car keys Bob Barker has given him. <br>

			<p>I lived in WV for a year.  Never in my life have I seen so many white people with their hands out for charity and government gimme programs.  Their population in the whole state is 1.8 million and of that like 1.7% is black.  So naturally the place is full of liberals who continually sspout on about the virtues of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>
<p>But not a one of them has ever seen REAL diversity in their midst.  WV is an isolated island of white fools and bums.  I wager Obama carries the state.</p>

<p>  I wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure of that. It depends on what part of the state your in. The Charleston and Huntington areas along with the Eastern panhandle have there share of blacks  &mdash;  maybe not in great numbers but enough to know the score. Of course, the various college towns are whooping it up for Obama. It will be a close election in West Virgina but I believe the state will go against Senator Obama, unlike some traditional &#8220;red&#8221; states. <br>

			<p>i think more than any other state wv represents the usa, and it will not go for obama. if it does, it is really over. when asked is one a white supremist, using the criteria of intelligence, integrity, accomplishment, compassion, civility, honesty, development, discovery, order, knowledge, etc; wouldn&rsquo;t we all be a member of a superior race just by virtue of being born to the white race. doesn&rsquo;t the white and asian races stand supreme. i gues it depends on what you use as criteria, but i think we should all defend being white. i am personally proud of it. i am white, that makes me supreme. simple logic. if you use savagry as the criteria, then other races would be supreme.</p>

			<p>Oh yeah! Obama just LOVES the white working class people SO much that he will solve their financial woes and secure employment and prosperity for THEM! This will be his top priority, and he will bend over backwards to achieve it! </p>
<p>RUBBISH! </p>
<p>He WILL likely be interested, however, in &#8216;reparations&rsquo; from these people for slavery   &mdash;   something a majority of white people have no real ties to anyway. It would be absolutely impossible to extract &#8216;compensation&rsquo; only from descendants of slave-owners and give it only to descendants of slaves. Nor would it be possible to determine just what would be &#8216;just compensation.&rsquo;<br>

			<p>To 6:32 and Bobby,</p>
<p>Usually minority means &#8220;BLACK&#8221;.  Other minorities DO NOT COUNT.<br>
Other minorites do not benefit one bit not one bit.  And<br>
once these idiots in the other minority neighborhoods vote<br>
with emotion for &#8220;THAT ONE&#8221;  And these idiots don&rsquo;t benefit<br>
except for their black brethren.  You can say I TOLD YOU SO<br>
YOU STUPID IDIOTS.  Because you should ask yourself when in hell<br>
did minority ever mean any other group except racial minority<br>
BLACKS.  Answer NEVER.  NEVER.  No other group benefited not<br>
one iota.  There is to be (if not already) a statue of Rosa Parks<br>
This woman is not Hispanic or Asian.  She is a member of a racial<br>
minority.  This statue should be a great resting place for many<br>
a pigeon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Common simple math will dictate that we middle class taxpaying slaves will be taxed more and more, there are simply MORE of us at the moment. This should be changing in the near future if our retirement plans hadn&rsquo;t taken a nose dive in recent years to the point that most will be working till we literally drop dead at work.</p>

			<p>Yes sir, I&rsquo;ve had enough!  Enough of these lying, liberal democrats who&rsquo;ve been in control of congress for the last two years*, when everything started to unravel (except for the great progress in the Iraq war, which we no longer hear about)<br>
 <br>
(* and who also took control of congress in 2001, not by the votes of the people, which gave the majority to the Republicans, but by a betrayal: remember Jumping Jim Jeffords, who changed his party affiliation after being elected as a Republican, giving Democrats control of the agenda in that house?) </p>
<p>And who in the last two years alone have managed to increase unemployment (when their min. wage increase took effect, unemployment went up two points, twenty percent of that was recently graduated students) and start a run on a bank, touching off the financial cave-in that was waiting to happen thanks to their foul play.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s time for change, all right!   Pelosi, Reid, Murtha, Clinton, Dodd, Schumer, Barney Frank, and the senator from my state- since 1979!!  Carl Levin, have got to go!!!</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t move forward with the failed policies of the past 64 years (FDR&rsquo;s &#8220;New Deal&#8221;, as well as LBJ&rsquo;s &#8220;Great Society&#8221;).  </p>
<p>Vote for change: get the Democrats out of congress!</p>
