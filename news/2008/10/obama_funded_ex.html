<h1>Obama Funded Extremist Afrocentrists Who Shared Rev. Wright&rsquo;s Anti-Americanism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stanley Kurtz, National Review, October 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John McCain, take note. Obama&rsquo;s tie to Wright is no longer a purely personal question (if it ever was one) about one man&rsquo;s choice of his pastor. The fact that Obama funded extremist Afrocentrists who shared Wright&rsquo;s anti-Americanism means that this is now a matter of public policy, and therefore an entirely legitimate issue in this campaign.</p>
<p><b>African Village</b></p>
<p>In the winter of 1996, the Coalition for Improved Education in [Chicago&rsquo;s] South Shore (CIESS) announced that it had received a $200,000 grant from the Chicago Annenberg Challenge. That made CIESS an &#8220;external partner,&#8221; i.e. a community organization linked to a network of schools within the Chicago public system. This network, named the &#8220;South Shore African Village Collaborative&#8221; was thoroughly &#8220;Afrocentric&#8221; in orientation. CIESS&rsquo;s job was to use a combination of teacher-training, curriculum advice, and community involvement to improve academic performance in the schools it worked with. CIESS would continue to receive large Annenberg grants throughout the 1990s.</p>
<p>The South Shore African Village Collaborative (SSAVC) was very much a part of the Afrocentric &#8220;rites of passage movement,&#8221; a fringe education crusade of the 1990s. SSAVC schools featured &#8220;African-Centered&#8221; curricula built around &#8220;rites of passage&#8221; ceremonies inspired by the puberty rites found in many African societies. In and of themselves, these ceremonies were harmless. Yet the philosophy that accompanied them was not. On the contrary, it was a carbon-copy of Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s worldview.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Jacob Carruthers</b></p>
<p>Like other leaders of the rites of passage movement, Carruthers teaches that the true birthplace of world civilization was ancient &#8220;Kemet&#8221; (Egypt), from which Kemetic philosophy supposedly spread to Africa as a whole. Carruthers and his colleagues believe that the values of Kemetic civilization are far superior to the isolating and oppressive, ancient Greek-based values of European and American civilization. Although academic Egyptologists and anthropologists strongly reject these historical claims, Carruthers dismisses critics as part of a white supremacist conspiracy to hide the truth of African superiority.</p>
<p>Carruthers&rsquo;s key writings are collected in his book, Intellectual Warfare. Reading it is a wild, anti-American ride. In his book, we learn that Carruthers and his like-minded colleagues have formed an organization called the Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations (ASCAC), which takes as its mission the need to &#8220;dismantle the European intellectual campaign to commit historicide against African peoples.&#8221; Carruthers includes &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; within a group he would define as simply &#8220;African.&#8221; When forced to describe a black person as &#8220;American,&#8221; Carruthers uses quotation marks, thus indicating that no black person can be American in any authentic sense. According to Carruthers, &#8220;The submission to Western civilization and its most outstanding offspring, American civilization, is, in reality, surrender to white supremacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carruthers&rsquo;s goal is to use African-centered education to recreate a separatist universe within America, a kind of state-within-a-state. The rites of passage movement is central to the plan. {snip}</p>
<p><b>America as Rape</b></p>
<p>{snip} In other words, American blacks (i.e. Africans) may have been forcibly exposed to American culture, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they need to accept it. The better option, says Carruthers, is to separate out and relearn the wisdom of Africa&rsquo;s original Kemetic culture, embodied in the teachings of the ancient wise man, Ptahhotep (an historical figure traditionally identified as the author of a Fifth Dynasty wisdom book). {snip}</p>
<p>Carruthers is a defender of Leonard Jeffries, professor in the department of black studies at City College in Harlem, infamous for his black supremacist and anti-Semitic views. Jeffries sees whites as oppressive and violent &#8220;ice people,&#8221; in contrast to peaceful and mutually supportive black &#8220;sun people.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>More of Carruthers&rsquo;s education philosophy can be found in his newsletter, The Kemetic Voice. In 1997, for example, at the same time Carruthers was advising SSAVC on how to set up an African-centered curriculum, he praised the decision of New Orleans&rsquo; School Board to remove the name of George Washington from an elementary school. Apparently, some officials in New Orleans had decided that nobody who held slaves should have a school named after him. Carruthers touted the name-change as proof that his African-centered perspective was finally having an effect on public policy. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Asa Hilliard</b></p>
<p>Chicago Annenberg Challenge records also indicate that SSAVC educators invited Asa Hilliard, a pioneer of African-centered curricula and a close colleague of Carruthers, to offer a keynote address at yet another Annenberg-funded teacher training session. Hilliard&rsquo;s ties to Wright run still deeper than Carruthers&rsquo;s. {snip}</p>
<p>Wright delivered the eulogy at Hilliard&rsquo;s memorial service, with prominent members of ASCAC in the audience. To commemorate Hilliard, a special, two-cover double issue of Wright&rsquo;s Trumpet Newsmagazine was published, with a picture of Hilliard on one side, and a picture of Louis Farrakhan on the other (in celebration of a 2007 award Farrakhan received from Wright). In short, the ties between Wright and Hilliard could hardly have been closer. Clearly, then, Wright&rsquo;s own educational philosophy was mirrored at the Annenberg-funded SSAVC, which sought out Hilliard&rsquo;s and Carruthers&rsquo;s counsel to construct its curriculum.</p>
<p>Perhaps inadvertently, Wright&rsquo;s eulogy for Hilliard actually established the fringe nature of his favorite African-centered scholars. In his tribute, Wright stressed how intensely &#8220;white Egyptologists recoiled at the very notion of everything Asa taught.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Obama&rsquo;s Knowledge</b></p>
<p>Given the precedent of his earlier responses on Ayers and Wright, Obama might be inclined to deny personal knowledge of the educational philosophy he was so generously funding. Such a denial would not be convincing. For one thing, we have evidence that in 1995, the same year Obama assumed control of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, he publicly rejected &#8220;the unrealistic politics of integrationist assimilation,&#8221; a stance that clearly resonates with both Wright and Carruthers. (See &#8220;No Liberation.&#8221;)</p>
<p>{snip}  Reading over SSAVC&rsquo;s Annenberg proposals, Obama could hardly be ignorant of what they were about. And if by some chance Obama overlooked Hilliard&rsquo;s or Carruthers&rsquo;s names, SSAVC&rsquo;s proposals are filled with references to &#8220;rites of passage&#8221; and &#8220;Ptahhotep,&#8221; dead giveaways for the anti-American and separatist ideological concoction favored by SSAVC.</p>
<p>We know that Obama did read the proposals. Annenberg documents show him commenting on proposal quality. And especially after 1995, when concerns over self-dealing and conflicts of interest forced the Ayers-headed &#8220;Collaborative&#8221; to distance itself from monetary issues, all funding decisions fell to Obama and the board. {snip}</p>
<p>As if the content of SSAVC documents wasn&rsquo;t warning enough, their proposals consistently misspelled &#8220;rites of passage&#8221; as &#8220;rights of passage,&#8221; hardly an encouraging sign from a group meant to improve children&rsquo;s reading skills. The Chicago Annenberg Challenge&rsquo;s own evaluators acknowledged that Annenberg-aided schools showed no improvement in achievement scores. Evaluators attributed that failure, in part, to the fact that many of Annenberg&rsquo;s &#8220;external partners&#8221; had little educational expertise. A group that puts its efforts into Kwanzaa celebrations and half-baked history certainly fits that bill, and goes a long way toward explaining how Ayers and Obama managed to waste upwards of $150 million without improving student achievement.</p>
<p>However he may seek to deny it, all evidence points to the fact that, from his position as board chair of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, Barack Obama knowingly and persistently funded an educational project that shared the extremist and anti-American philosophy of Jeremiah Wright. The Wright affair was no fluke. It&rsquo;s time for McCain to say so.<br>
