				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Hope and Richard Edwards, Telegraph (London), October 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Trevor Phillips, the chairman of Commission for Equalities and Human Rights, said that one of the causes of knife crime was a lack of integration for refugee children who had witnessed untold horrors in their early lives.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;There is a very specific issue for some minority communities in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds. We have had a generation of refugee children who have come from unimaginable levels of violence, absolutely terrifying situations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We admit them &mdash; rightly &mdash; and then we plonk them in schools and we expect behave like everyone else. You look at the names of those who are involved, they come from Congo, they come from east Africa and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think anybody has been very keen on saying it. Let&rsquo;s recognise what it is that is making it happen. It is not the fact that they are black but the fact that they have come from vicious, wartorn regions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comments come amid widespread concern about knife crime. Figures earlier this summer revealed that one person is the victim of such a crime every four minutes and the Home Affairs Committee said that it will be launching an inquiry into knife crime in November.</p>
<p>Last year, teenage Angolan refugee Roberto Malasi was jailed for 30 years after he admitted stabbing to death an 18-year-old student and shooting dead a woman cradling a baby at a christening in a two week period.</p>
<p>The Old Bailey heard that the killings were the culmination of his horrific &#8220;upbringing of pitiless persecution&#8221; in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>Sir John Nutting QC, his defence lawyer, said that Malasi was influenced by witnessing scenes of daily violence in his early teens, including people being &#8220;hanged, shot and burned to death&#8221;.</p>
<p>Campaigners welcomed the comments from Mr Phillips. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: &#8220;This is another courageous intervention from Trevor Phillips. If we are to tackle these problems we must have a frank analysis of where they stem from.</p>
<p>&#8220;The black African community now numbers 694,000 and has overtaken the black Caribbean group as a result of high net migration in recent years. This is a further consequence of our failure to control immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Damian Green, the shadow immigration minister, added: &#8220;Obviously knife crime is a much wider problem than just affecting immigrant communities. But what Trevor Phillips has illustrated a wider problem with integration. As well as having no control over the numbers the Government has failed to integrate new arrivals successfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesman from the Home Office said: &#8220;Violent crime is an extremely complex issue with many different drivers. With knife crime, we are concerned about the number of young people involved and the age of both victims and offenders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, said: &#8220;It appears as though there is some evidence that people who have experienced violence and a difficult upbringing continue this cycle of violence. But I don&rsquo;t think that this is just refugees but also British children who are brought up surrounded by violence in many forms, from their parents, peers and exposure to violent films and games.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&ldquo;We admit them &mdash; rightly &mdash;  &#8220;</p>
<p>Why rightly? Don&rsquo;t the British have any sense of self defense? If they do they will start ASAP electing right wing parties who won&rsquo;t sell out the pulbic&rsquo;s safety and quality of life for feel-good nonsensical &#8220;diversity&#8221;. On the other hand, if the British are as suicidally stupid as most evidence indicates, then they deserve their horrible darwinian fate.</p>

			<p>If those refugees from wore torn countries don&rsquo;t integrate well, why are relocated to a white nation like England? Why aren&rsquo;t these knife wielding thugs relocated to another country in Africa? I hear the blacks in South Africa are pretty welcoming to their fellow bruthas and sistas. Moveover, we are told it&rsquo;s only whites who are intolerant towards immigrants, right? Or could it be blacks are the most intolerant people on the planet &hellip; even towards their own as evidenced by this:- </p>

			<p>Typical leftist hogwash.  In their eyes, the white victims of such crimes are expendable and of should be expected to pay the ultimate price in order to admit those immigrants into Britain.  One can only assume that they are also in favor of bringing immigrants in who suffer from infectious diseases consequences be damned. If those idiots are so concerned about the welfare of Africans, let them go to Africa and try to solve the problems there.</p>

			<p>Note that USA and English crime rates remained about the same before and after WW1 and WWII, despite the fact that millions of British and American men were exposed to months, if not years of brutal death, dismemberment, deprivation, and savagery during those wars.  It seems that one race (Europeans) can experience violence, and still maintain high morality and civility, whereas Africans are incapable of doing so.  This is just another reason why Africans should not be allowed into European countries.</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter why they do it   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s the fact that they do it that matters.  Wherever Africans go, the results are the same: crime, ignorance, poverty, and savagery follows, and that is why they need to remain in their homeland.  </p>

			<p>As the MP, Keith Vaz says, &#8220;there is some evidence that people who have experienced violence and a difficult upbringing continue this cycle of violence.&#8221; Likewise there are other cycles of violence that affect others, if less virulent. The Britons who are forced to live closest to these newer, imported levels are likely to be infected with its contagion, rather than provide exemplars for these violent black children and teach them how to live more peaceful existences. </p>
<p>Britons and other Europeans have largely overcome propensities to violence, displacing it into football and other symbolic activities that absorb atavistic tendencies. We are trained suffer immense shame for war and bloodshed in our pasts. The reasons for our wars are often overlooked in the name of shame. We are not permitted to inquire into why Germany was supported by half of Europe in World War II. Instead we contemn the Germans as Nazis, while holocaust denial is a crime. The costs of our modern wars is now overshadowed by the costs of reconstruction, as in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
<p>But black countries still celebrate war; every country in Africa is racked by crime and poverty on the scale of war. The figures given in another article here today on murder rates in South Africa are only available because this country was recently more civilised due to white rule. The tools and organisation needed for collected statistics still exist, together with some white statisticians able to make sense of them. But in the rest of Africa, there are no reliable statistics because the infrastructure does not exist to compile them. African tribalism and contempt for law and order beyond the clan or the control of the local warlord has nor changed in the course of recorded history. Perhaps it has been exacerbated by magnified populations that have not been able to adapt the technologies to feed, let alone house and educate, themselves. </p>
<p>Despite what Trevor Philips says, Britain has very wrongly brought these people into Britain. The British government has committed a grave wrong against the British people it has forced to live side by side with the ungrateful, savage refugees. </p>

			<p>Liberals really are colorblind. <br>
Surely when assessing a problem you would want to look at all the applicapable data.<br>
Not just cherry pick the aspects that exhonorate the perpetrators in this common group.<br>
It must take alot of internal discipline to ignore &#8216;what&rsquo;s staring you in the face&rsquo;.<br>

<p>Yes, but the MAIN cause of knife crime among these people is because they&rsquo;re black, and they have a natural propensity for violence and serious problems with impulse control.</p>
<p>And, these reasons are reason enough to find out who was responsible for allowing primitives into the country, which amounts to the importation of crime and violence, and assuring the guilty party (parties)gets a chance to discover his inner child in a dank cell in solitary confinement for about 40 years.</p>
<p>And Mr. Trevor Phillips needs about two to three thousand hours of intense training until he&rsquo;s able to understand what many people are able to figure out themselves in five minutes, and failing in that, he could be placed in a cell also.</p>

<p>He shot a woman to death?? I thought their gun laws were supposed to prevent such tragedies? I mean the crowd over here that wants to outlaw guns has promised us a murder-free paradise.</p>

<p>Why is it that whites, such jewish children who suffered untold horrors in the holocaust and survived didn&rsquo;t grow up and go around knifing and shooting others? Why is it that asians who suffered early horrors in wars such as in Vietnam, didn&rsquo;t grow up to do the same. Why only do blacks seem to do this??</p>

			<p>Immigrants should be chosen by a points system, if at all.  </p>
<p>Those who come from societies with a high level of violence, corruption, and dysfunction should be scored as unlikely candidates for admission.</p>

			<p>Curiously, Mr. Phillips does not explain what made these Africans&rsquo; countries of origin violent in the first place; perhaps violence merely falls out of the sky upon Africa.</p>
<p>It is a sad, sick notion that the failure of these tribal primitives to thrive in England is somehow the fault of native Britons and their government. It is an altogether common view among liberals, however. </p>

			<p>It is significant that, in South Africa under a white government, crime was low due to a strong police force that was highly motivated.  Black people were not allowed to freely walk or drive in white areas without permission after dark and this spilled over into black areas where crime was also low, especially when the various tribes were also kept apart.  Since te end of Apartheid, people of all races have been attacked even in their homes and violently killed or tortured to find out &#8220;where the cash is hidden&#8221;.  Rape in endemic in a country with the highest incidence of known HIV in the world.</p>
<p>It has been published in South Africa that more blacks have been unlawfully killed since the end of Apartheid (15 years)than in all the years it existed (1948 to 1992 - 44 years).  </p>
<p>Since the Marxist terrorist trained ANC has come to power, black Zimbabwean foreigners who moved to Sat to eat and live have been murdered or badly beaten by other blacks, in some cases even set on fire with &#8220;necklacing&#8221; (burning petrol filled car-tyre around the victim&rsquo;s neck) being the method used, the same method that the ANC introduced and used to terrorise blacks into supporting their terror movement in the old days.</p>
<p>When I was a young lad, I joined the Royal Air Force, and being colour-blind and unable to fly because of it, I took the engineering route with a three year full-time course.  We had all types from Commonwealth countries, and the ones we had to be very careful of were the Pakistanis.  If, as happens where young men with lots of testosterone are gathered, arguments broke out, the Pakistanis would not hesitate to pull a knife and use it without any thoughts of the consequences.   As a result they did not assimilate with any of the others and were avoided by especially us whites.  The Burmese were great guys, the Rhodesians, Australians and New Zealanders also great.   </p>
<p>But violence comes more readily to black Africans than the &#8220;civilised&#8221; Europeans and this is being proven everyday now with the violent crime rates there in places like South Africa where the government is unable to control the years of murder and rape etc.  But the old white government did.  What to do though?  </p>
<p>I reject this being called a &#8220;racist&#8221; by the ignorant for telling it like it is, and not how a few deluded people (who believe that appeasement is the answer) would like it to be. But I do not mind being called a realist.</p>
<p>You cannot solve a problem without acknowledging the facts.  An established engineering principle which applies to life. </p>

			<p>Anyone who watches the TV news in Britain (especially London) will realise that the majority of knife attacks and stabbing murders are perpetrated by black Carribeans (judging from their Anglo-Saxon names).<br>
Trevor Phillips is himself a black Carribean.It is possible that he is trying to deflect the deserved blame from his own people onto another black group as a defence mechanism.</p>

			<p>If Mr. Phillips is right about people from war torn countries being naturally violent then the refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia should have been some of the meanest SOBs on earth. </p>
<p>I personnaly think they are so violent because they think they can get away with it. I believe that if you put a few against the wall and shoot them all the violence will stop, even if it doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s worth a try. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s impossible!  The British government has made the streets of England safe by outlawing private hand gun ownership.  We will soon make USA streets equally safe, by similarly outlawing hand guns in the USA.</p>

			<p> Looks like they will try to ban knives next. After<br>
all, this is one of the reasons they banned guns. Some<br>
races of people cannot handle them properly. So we all<br>
must have them taken away.</p>

			<p>I, too, have been surprised at the extremely low level of violence or &#8220;acting out&#8221; among Jews who survived the Holocaust. I&rsquo;m uncertain about the reason, because I&rsquo;m sure many of them suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. The survivors are quite old now, but when you interview them it&rsquo;s still shocking how vivid their memories are. The Africans certainly behave differently!</p>

			<p>When I was growing up in Britain in the 1950s (a different country), it was normal for boys to carry knives - they were used for sharpening pencils, making bows and arrows and such like, but not for killing people. I had a sheath knife which would get me arrested today.</p>
<p>Yesterday I read that four or five stores in SE London were being prosecuted for selling &#8220;dangerous&#8221; knives. The knives are not the problem, and never were.</p>

<p>Knives(or guns) don&rsquo;t kill people, people kill people.</p>

<p>There is a movement afoot in here in the USA to make guns illegal. These people think it will stop gun violence. However, unlike today, in 1950&rsquo;s America, there was little or no gun control and almost no gun violence yet today with all the gun control, we have so much gun violence in black inner cities. The problem isn&rsquo;t guns.</p>

			<p>You said the Burmese, New Zealanders and Australians were great what about the Caribbean people like from Jamaica?</p>
<p>I guess also that in England black Caribbean peoples especially from Jamaica have a very high crime statistics. </p>
<p>I am from the Caribbean and I will be branded a racist but in Jamaica there is extrordinary crime, anarchy and black on black murders to the point of being one of the highest in the world. There is really a problem socially and psychologically with blacks&hellip;..</p>
