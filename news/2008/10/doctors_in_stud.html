<h1><a href="https://seattlepi.nwsource.com/health/385343_doctorbias29.html">Doctors in Study Prefer Whites to Blacks</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Vanessa Ho, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Oct. 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racial disparities have long been documented in health care, but a University of Washington study on doctors&rsquo; possible biases is validating the feelings of many African-American patients.</p>
<p>Released Tuesday, the study found that most doctors unconsciously prefer white people to black people. The exception was black doctors, who exhibited no preference for either race.</p>
<p>Researcher Janice Sabin was quick to say the results do not imply prejudice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to not leave the impression that this necessarily affects behavior, because we really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sabin, an assistant UW professor in medical education and training.</p>
<p>More research is needed, she said, to know whether bias affects care.</p>
<p>But the study &mdash; the first large one to explore bias among doctors &mdash; can help providers be aware of hidden attitudes, Sabin said, &ldquo;which can only improve patient communication and clinical interaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The research is among the latest to use the Implicit Association Test, a famous psychological tool developed by a UW professor more than 10 years ago to measure unconscious bias.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 2002 landmark report from the Institute of Medicine found that minorities receive poorer care than whites in many areas, from transplants to cancer to cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>A Dartmouth study found that blacks in Seattle receive crucial blood tests at lower rates than whites, and undergo leg amputations &mdash; often caused by diabetes and vascular disease &mdash; more often than whites.</p>
<p>Studies that control for differences in income and education levels also have found racial disparities in care, Fleming said.</p>
<p>None of that surprised Lakesha Braggs, an African-American human-resources employee from Shoreline who sees a white doctor in Everett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor kind of treats you as &lsquo;less than,&rsquo; &ldquo; she said. She has often watched her doctor act pleasantly with white patients, only to turn impatient with her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an underlying cultural issue. It&rsquo;s just something you live with.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>Having worked as a doctor in the inner city for over 20 years I can say from experience that Black doctors prefer White patients. All one has to do is walk through an &#8220;inner city&#8221; hospital and you will encounter a multitude of white doctors while walking through a suburban hospital you will encounter many more Black doctors. The proof is there for anyone who wishes to be observant.</p>

			<p>I would think that most doctors might prefer white patients to black patients is that white patients tend to follow the advice of their doctor.When a black patent is told to watch their diet.Take their medication on time or exercise.My own prejudice tends to tell me that black patients wouldignore much of their doctors orders.The same way that black people tend to ignore the law and end up being 50 per cent of our prison population although being only 13 per cent of the population.</p>

<p>Do you really need a study for this?  I am pretty sure the Doctor, Banker, Car Salesmen, all the way down to the kid working at Taco Bell prefers a white customer over a black one.</p>

			<p>Lol&hellip;.they should be looking at disparities in PATIENT behavior according to race.  As a physician, let me tell you&hellip;.blacks are a pain in the ass to treat.  Not all.  But, depending on where you live&hellip;most.</p>
<p>90% of what a doctor does, comes from the patient.  A good doctor is trained in one technique above all others&hellip;the diagnostic interview.  When you see a doctor, the interaction has a specific goal&hellip;to get the patient to give all the pertinent facts about what is wrong with them, while wasting as little time as possible.  Blacks have a very interesting way of looking at the world that is best described as raving psychosis.  Almost anything that comes out of their mouths, is unreliable at best, an overt falsehood at worst.  Blacks will lie and distort for no reason at all (and that&rsquo;s assuming they aren&rsquo;t there just to get off work or get narcotics).  If you ask them the same question 5 minutes later, you get a completely different answer.  Rarely is it an accurate portrayel of what is wrong with them.  This makes diagnosis difficult, sometimes impossible and is a major contributor to race related mortality and morbidity due to disease.</p>
<p>Then, there is the issue of responsibility.  Rarely, will a black patient continue their treatment for more than a couple of days.  Usually, they won&rsquo;t even fill the prescription, even if it&rsquo;s free.  Follow up ALWAYS has to assume the patient did not take/did not finish, any medications given since last time.  If asked, they will often lie about this&hellip;.even if various expected changes don&rsquo;t happen in blood work or other specialized tests.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be frank here&hellip;..doctors HATE treating blacks.  Often, they are rude, act inappropriately and have dangerous diseases you don&rsquo;t want to be exposed to&hellip;AIDS, TB, etc.  But, even when they are nice and act relatively normally, it is often simply a waste of time trying to treat them.  They don&rsquo;t engage the therapeutic process.  It would be nice if medicine was like it is on Star Trek, where you wave a device over the patient, instantly know what&rsquo;s wrong, press a magic syringe on their arm and they get better within seconds with no responsibility needed on their part.  But, it&rsquo;s not even close to that.  Instead, it&rsquo;s a skilled, labor intensive process that takes the active cooperation of both doctor and patient.</p>
<p>And blacks don&rsquo;t do their part.</p>

			<p>I really think that the tipping point will come in this country when whites begin shrugging off insinuations that they are &#8220;unconsciously&#8221; or consciously racist in the same way that the villagers in the famous story began disregarding the boy who cried wolf.</p>
<p>When the charge of racism is <i>publicly</i> shrugged off as no more than a petty annoyance, then we&rsquo;ll be out of the woods.</p>
<p>But if that never happens, if whites remain terrorized by the R word, no matter how hollow the charge, well&hellip;then we&rsquo;re dead. </p>

			<p>My guess would be that White Doctors who have spent almost a decade in school, and huge sums of money on that school don&rsquo;t have much patience for lazy disgruntled people who come to them with no intentions or ability to pay. Simple fact is, Whites tend to have insurance, or at least a job that will allow them to make monthly payments. If you ran a grocery store that was forced to give out bread, even if the customer couldn&rsquo;t pay, you would probably have a negative attitude towards the penniless people who come in. Just a guess though.</p>

			<p>I am a doctor, and I am quite conscious about my preference for white patients.  Black patients are notorious for  not showing up for their appointments without bothering to cancel them, not complying with their treatment, and not paying for their care.  And, once they are on medical leave, they will not go back to work until their disability benefits are completely exhausted.</p>

			<p>Any time you see one of these studies, you can count on the following sentence being present, as it is this time. &#8220;More research is needed&#8221;.</p>
<p>I disagree. No more researh is needed. Almost any poster here can tell you what you want to know without spending more on unnessessary studies. Here are your answers, free of charge: Doctors are human, just like the rest of us. They dont want someone telling them they are wrong, that they arent doing their job, that they are evercharging them, that they are racist against black people. They dont want a bunch of loud, rowdy, obnoxious black kids running aroung in their waiting rooms. They dont want the inevitable violence that comes with black peopel. We all know there are plenty more reasons, but facing false accusations of racism has to be number one. </p>

			<p>One theory why black patients might get lower quality health care than whites that I thought of is this:  As a matter of central tendency, blacks seek health care in urban areas.  Urban hospitals engage in more affirmative action in hiring than other hospitals and clinics.  Therefore, black patients go to hospitals and clinics that tend to have more non-white physicians, nurses and staff.  Therefore, the quality of the health care is lower.</p>

			<p> Once again we see a story built on questionable &#8220;studies,&#8221; then fleshed out with &#8220;personal experience&#8221; anecdotes from a black who by definition has a vested interest in saying that White doctors are &#8220;racist.&#8221; Why didn&rsquo;t the story give at least a passing look at how these &#8220;studies&#8221; determined these &#8220;preferences&#8221;?</p>
<p> And I really found it amusing that White doctors supposedly favored White patients, but black doctors &#8220;showed no preference&#8221; between Whites and blacks. Sure   &mdash;   and it don&rsquo;t rain in Indianapolis in the summertime.</p>

<p>Since when has the fact that these taxpayer funded University &#8220;researchers&#8221; &#8220;don&rsquo;t really know&#8221; prevent them from reaching and stating a conclusion consistent with their &#8220;impressions&#8221; ?</p>

<p>If you have the &#8220;black attitude&#8221; that is so typical, this could be a reason why your doc grows impatient with you.</p>

			<p>Then go to black doctors. Are blacks familiar with the history of the black physician in the Bakke affirmative action case?</p>
<p>Trying to communicate with ignorant black knuckleheads about the subtleties of symptoms, medical history, etc. must be torture because a) they have no idea what is being asked of them and b) it&rsquo;s all in vain because blacks are so self-destructive. </p>

<p>Hyperoffensibility.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t because many blacks are regressed child like psychopaths who are depraved in the manner of showing? This isn&rsquo;t because blacks behave badly and don&rsquo;t like them as a result? Given how they act can you blame white people?</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like it go see a black doctor.</p>

			<p>Not very suprising considering that according to the results obtained with Harvard&rsquo;s implicit association test, anyone does, including blacks themselves:</p>
<p><a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/" rel="nofollow">https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/</a></p>
<p><br>
Of course they probably have some airy sociological theory involving racism of some sort for why that is so&hellip;</p>

			<p>Yes; all blacks should stick to black doctors.  That&rsquo;ll help their health, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>And white doctors should refrain from seeing black patients, for fear of unconsciously underserving them.</p>
<p>(Btw, if I had to guess, black doctors &#8220;show no preference&#8221; because conflicting behaviors (preference for blacks based on shared ethnicity, preference for whites based on merit) probably cancel each other out (this is seen in blacks in general).</p>

			<p>This is supposed to be an academic study?  It&rsquo;s unbelievable.  So, because blacks &#8220;undergo leg amputations &mdash; often caused by diabetes and vascular disease &mdash; more often than whites&#8221;, that&rsquo;s proof that white doctors are denying them treatment?  Has anybody thought to check whether blacks actually have higher rates of those diseases?  Maybe it&rsquo;s just me, but I would have thought that might be relevant.  Likewise the point referred to in several posts here, namely that they don&rsquo;t follow the prescribed treatment.  That might explain why they eventually have to resort to amputation.</p>
<p>Naah&hellip; must be racism.<br>

			<p>&#8220;white patients tend to follow the advice of their doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>My black friend, unlike me, never misses taking his medications, so that&rsquo;s not always true. I do believe the &#8216;not showing up to appointments on time&rsquo; though. Some of this stuff could be explained away by &#8216;poverty&rsquo; - the greater percentage of blacks being assisted by the taxpayer and living in poverty.</p>

<p>Just last night I had a conversation with some Kuwaiti men, and they dislike black africans, but the dislike of American blacks is intense. The conversation was about the potential for destruction of the U.S. if we foolishly elect a black for president, so even the Arabs can see the folly of such a happening. They even commented that all of America would be like Detroit (each of whom have been to Detroit)</p>

  The pertinence of these words extends to much further than doctor&rsquo;s consulting room.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not a doctor but I would imagine that blacks have much higher tendencies of either not paying the bill or trying to get out of it paying it, being obnoxious and overly demanding or failing to follow advice or take responsibility for their own health. When black men have higher rates of amputations, it&rsquo;s likely as someone else pointed out, that they didn&rsquo;t follow previous advice such as stopping smoking. Black women have higher infant mortality levels because they are less likely to go to the doctor, even though a lot of them are on medicaid and get it free, use drugs while pregnant and fail to follow medical advice.</p>

			<p>For a society to dwell on such nonsense means unequivocally that it is one that is dysfunctional, especially when it is known that there are mentally and emotionally disturbed people who think that anything that has to do with human nature, regarding racial problems, must be controlled somehow.</p>
<p>What this geek is trying to do in her own dumb way is to contribute information she thinks will intimidate people into altering their natural instincts, because her illness prompts her to do so.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just whites that must be controlled. By any means necessary (sarcasm). </p>

			<p>My wife is a nurse at a &#8220;charity&#8221; hospital in Louisiana. The vast majority of blacks totally ignore any pre-natal or post-natal care. The nurses stopped years ago asking the women the name of their husband for the hospital records. Now they ask for the baby daddy&rsquo;s name and about half the time the woman has no idea. These people come in have their babies at tax payer expense and take their free diapers and car seat. They never bring the baby back for any follow up and aren&rsquo;t seen until about 9 months later ready to bring the next one in the world. The names of these babies are a riot (Nosmoking, Vagina, Urine, Mandingo are just a few). Our tax dollars support this.</p>

			<p>I can see this study being waved around in the court by attorneys in a whole new era of racial malpractice cases.  In fact, this suspicious retired doctor thinks that this may have been the only reason for the study to have been done and published.</p>

			<p>Well look.. how do you want to spend your time and what do you want to be enabling? Do you want to patch up gangsters all day so they can go back to robbing, selling drugs, and acts of violence? Or would you rather patch up law abiding tax payers and send them back to raise their families up correctly and keep America strong? </p>

			<p>Maybe the doctors (and their staff) just prefer to deal with people who can read and properly fill out the paperwork.</p>

As the doctors on this post have noted, along with every white person who has to interact with blacks, dealing with blacks is nothing but a headache. Deal with a few blacks and you quickly learn you want nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>Some blacks are very nice just as some white are very rude. What we always come back to are the proportions. Proportionately, blacks are largely a pain in the neck. Anyone who has do deal with them at work knows this. They know they&rsquo;re going to give you attitude. They know they&rsquo;re going to ask ridiculous questions and not understand the answer. Even when you try to help them, they don&rsquo;t understand the instructions and turn on you. If you&rsquo;re white and you make the mistake of asking the wrong question or using the wrong word, you&rsquo;re in danger losing your job. (example: my sister is a teacher and a black student was out for a test. The next day, she had the boy make up the test and let him take the test undisturbed in the classroom across the hall which was empty at the time. That night, she gets an angry call from the parent who complained that my sister was implying her son was stupid because the empty classroom was for a class one grade lower. My sister had to attended a meeting with the parent and principle and grovel. And she was trying to HELP the kid by letting him take the test undisturbed! My sister and her co-workers are counting their days to retirement.)</p>
<p>What this study can&rsquo;t do is get doctors to give them their honest reasons as to why they don&rsquo;t like treating blacks. If these doctors, like those posting on this board would tell them if they didn&rsquo;t live in fear of losing their livelihood, is that on the whole, blacks are more trouble than they&rsquo;re worth.</p>
<p>My advice to every white person is to avoid interaction with blacks whenever possible. No interaction, no trouble.<br>

			<p>&#8220;My black friend, unlike me, never misses taking his medications, so that&rsquo;s not always true. I do believe the &lsquo;not showing up to appointments on time&rsquo; though. Some of this stuff could be explained away by &lsquo;poverty&rsquo; - the greater percentage of blacks being assisted by the taxpayer and living in poverty&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course not all blacks are like this but a much larger portion are. As far as blacks living in &#8220;poverty&#8221; this is not true for most of them and for the ones that are, it&rsquo;s THEIR lifestyle and bad choices. Most have a much easier time when it comes to getting medical care, education and everything else because they are far more likely to get government aid. Far more blacks get medical care free or almost free on medicaid or get college free because they get a grant from the government. It&rsquo;s the average working class white that gets nothing because they are white that has less access to medical care and education than the blacks. </p>
