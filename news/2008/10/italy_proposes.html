<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7672805.stm">Italy Proposes Immigrant Classes</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, Oct. 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A controversial scheme to create special classes for immigrant children has been approved by the lower house of Italy&rsquo;s parliament. </p>
<p>The measure, proposed by the right-wing Northern League Party, would require foreign children to pass a special test before being admitted into schools. </p>
<p>The league says the proposal will help integration, but opposition leaders have denounced it as xenophobic. </p>
<p>The measure still has to be approved by the Senate before it becomes law. </p>
<p>Under the proposal, the children of immigrants would have to sit tests on citizenship and would be placed in &ldquo;bridge classes&rdquo; if they failed, where they would study Italian language, law and culture until they could pass the test. </p>
<p>A spokesman for the Northern League said the aim was to guarantee equal opportunities for foreign students and facilitate integration. </p>
<p>But opposition politicians have described it as &ldquo;an act of the worst xenophobia&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Today day we create special classes for foreign pupils, tomorrow for the disabled, the day after for homosexuals,&rdquo; said one critic. </p>
<p>The lower house of parliament passed the measure in a vote of 265 to 246. </p>
<p>Crime fear </p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Duncan Kennedy in Rome says the Northern League, which is part of the Italy&rsquo;s centre-right government coalition, has long taken a robust stand on immigration issues. </p>
<p>Last week, it proposed plans for a residecy permit system based on points, which would be deducted for criminal activity. Immigrants would face deportation if their points ran out. </p>
<p>And earlier this year, the league was behind the introduction of an internationally condemned scheme to fingerprint Roma gypsies. </p>
<p>The league says it is only responding to the fears of many Italians especially over crime which it claims involves a high proportion of foreigners, says our correspondent. </p>
<p>Critics says the measures border on racism and fuel social tensions which have already led to a series of violent attacks involving minorities. <br>

			<p>This is silly, and a distraction from the real issue. Immigration should end and non Italians must leave Italy.  Otherwise, there will be no Italy in the future.</p>

<p>America already has special schools for the disabled, and a &#8220;gay-friendly&#8221; school has opened up in Chicago. Maybe that&rsquo;s his point; the rest of the world now looks at America as a cautionary tale, not as a role model.</p>

			<p>&#8221; a series of violent attacks involving minorities&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is truly an Orwellian statement.  Involving minorities means the minorities attacked Italians.  But these weasel words try to make it look as though racist Italians attacked minorities.</p>
<p>Italians need to look at their own history.  Hundreds of thousands of Italians kidnapped into slavery off the coastal areas by muslim pirates over the years. The city of Rome under muslim occupation for 100 years 750 to 850 Ad.</p>
<p>Looks like history is repeating itself.</p>

			<p>Italy should seek immigrants from among the tens of millions of Italians in South America and failing that, from other European countries. <br>
Italy will need immigrants as its population is in stark decline. Those who are young and of Italian descent or of a similar culture, even from the USA should seek to migrate to Italy. It is a beautiful country with a great lifestyle and much to offer but with a birthrate of about 1.2 children per woman. This is far too low. If enough assimilable people dont migrate there soon the unassimilable will form growing enclaves and eventually the country will be lost to Western Civilization.</p>

<p><br>
There&rsquo;ll be no need for any such thing as long as the disabled and the homosexuals are Italians. </p>
<p>Although the ultimate goal of iimmigrants from Italy   &mdash;   and every other historically white nation   &mdash;   should be EXPLUSION, the Lega Nord&rsquo;s &#8220;acculturation classes&#8221; are a step in the Right direction. Third Worlders flood into First World countries absolutely CLUELESS about how things are done in the new land; these classes   &mdash;   and I favor having them for adults as well as for children   &mdash;   will lower their &#8220;alien&#8221; factor and make them less annoying, burdensome and, yes, VIOLENT toward their Italian hosts. </p>
<p>You know: Teach these North Africans not to ritually slaughter their goats on their apartment balconies; or take a blade to their daughters&rsquo; private parts. That sort of thing&hellip; <br>

<p>Samuel Francis called it &#8216;Anarcho-fascism&rsquo;. The more depraved non-whites become - the more the authorities crack down on whites. Don&rsquo;t let the truth interfere with a good angle or a good story. What&rsquo;s logical about it? It makes no difference how many of our lives are lost or how we suffer. They import colored people in order to give them an excuse to bring controls down on us. </p>

			<p>You don&rsquo;t want the non-Whites to assimilate to Italian culture.  Those who actually learn to sound and act like Italians will only become front men for the foreign mobs, going on TV to calm the White masses with assurances that these hordes of aliens are just like them.  &#8220;See,&#8221; the anti-racists will say, &#8220;the Afro-Italians are no threat, they even speak better that most working class Italians do.&#8221;  Just like American movies, where capable Blacks abound, the Italian media will convince millions that the extraordinary Gypsy or Moslem or Black who can behave himself is typical.  In twenty years, Italians looking for &#8220;Hope&Change;&#8221; will elect their own Massaya.  </p>

<p>The problem for us Italians is that most of the information we get about the US comes from either Hollywood movies or our own politically correct media. What we can tell from these sources is:<br>
1-US blacks are nice folks, only oppressed by white racism.<br>
2-We never even heard about a Mexican problem.</p>
<p>Therefore some of us believe that these immigrants we have now in Italy are misbehaving only because they are &#8220;new&#8221;, but in a few decades they will become perfectly assimilated - just like the blacks in America!</p>
<p>Americans are in a better position because even if they&rsquo;re exposed to the liberal media, they can get first hand experience of black misbehavior, and they also know that these people have been troublesome since their nation began, so they have all the elements to get to the conclusion that black misbehavior is a permanent problem that will not go away.</p>

<p>I agree with most of your points. As a US Citizen with Italian (and therefore EU) Citizen, I am seriously considering moving back to where half my ancestry derives.</p>
<p>Just one little correction for posterity sake:</p>
<p>That 1.2 # is out of date, the actual number (circa 2007) is 1.4 childern per ethnic Italian woman. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.demo.istat.it/bil2007/index_e.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.demo.istat.it/bil2007/index_e.html</a></p>
<p>Still not near the necessary 2.1, but there&rsquo;s been a gradual uptick in native birthrates there since the early 2000s. For some reason, the CIA factbook doesn&rsquo;t update the birthrate firgures (with the exception of France).</p>

<p>Where did you come up with that, anyway?  Rome was NEVER in its history under Islamic occupation!  Rome was nominally a part of the Byzantine Empire until 751 A.D., when the Lombards abolished the Exarchate of Ravenna.  In 756 A.D. the Franks drove the Lombards out and the Frankish king Pepin the Short gave the Pope temporal power over the city and surrounding areas, thus establishing what came to be known as the &#8220;Papal States.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the way, in the year 800 A.D. the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned &#8220;Emperor of the Romans&#8221; in Rome by Pope Leo III, which would have been impossible had the area been under Islamic domination.<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
And not only for Italians, but for everyone everywhere. The pervasive influence of Hollywood abroad is amazing to see.  All-conquering American pop culture is triumphant almost everywhere.  At least in what is called the &#8220;western world&#8221;.  Halle Berry, Beyonce, Janet Jackson, LL CoolJ,  and others are pushed on the public  from every poster and newsstand.  Halle Berry, I notice, is heavily promoted in Switzerland and Germany as the American sex goddess - the hottest female alive,<i> the ideal woman. </i>  The pulp magazines in Europe and South America, just as in the US, are full of breathless gossip about the latest doings of these &#8220;American&#8221;  stars.   (In S.America, though, they focus on Britney Spears rather than Halle Berry.)  And of course, they swoon over Madonna and Angelina with their adorable multiracial adoptees.  Walk into any store or supermarket in Paris and you&rsquo;ll be serenaded by some rapper - in American ebonics, not French. It&rsquo;s the trendy thing   &mdash;   they think.  And our TV programs and sitcoms are very popular around the world. I&rsquo;ve met people from Australia and New Zealand who knew more about American TV programs than I did.</p>
<p>This Hollywood image is frequently all that the world&rsquo;s public knows about America.  I was once asked by a very old lady in Portugal (when I told her I was American)&hellip; if I was a cowboy or a gangster.  She asked me this with a perfectly straight face.  Apparently, to her, those were the only options.</p>

<p> Don&rsquo;t get fooled again Italy. Blacks have had almost three hundred years to assimilate into American society and have failed. The gypsies have been in Europe for over seven hundred years and haven&rsquo;t assimilated. What more examples do you need?</p>

<p><br>
Read Oriana Fallaci&rsquo;s books. Her books describe it well. The city and the port and the entire area was under control of muslims.  The pirates came up the Tiber river and stayed.  The muslim occupation was the reason the Papacy put the wall around the vatican.  The muslims were all over Rome, pillaging, murdering and kidnapping girls for the sex slave trade.</p>
<p>Muslims were all over Southern Italy as well as Sicily in those days.</p>

			<p>Rome was not under Muslim occupation for any period of time. The Muslims came and sacked the city once, but they didn&rsquo;t stay.</p>
<p>The only part of Italy that was under prolonged Muslim rule is Sicily.</p>
