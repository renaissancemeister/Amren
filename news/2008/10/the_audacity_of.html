				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phyllis Schlafly, Townhall, October 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To see why it is impossible for Obama to play this transcending role, read his autobiography, &#8220;Dreams From My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.&#8221; His Dreams are obsessed with race and race conflict.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama describes how he deliberately separated himself from his multiracial heritage in order to give himself a 100 percent black persona, different and alienated from the white world around him. Obama writes that the book is &#8220;a record of a personal, interior journey&#8221; to establish himself as &#8220;a black American.&#8221;</p>
<p>With his new all-black identity, Obama stews about injustices that he never personally experienced and feeds his warped worldview by withdrawing into a &#8220;smaller and smaller coil of rage.&#8221; He lives with a &#8220;nightmare vision&#8221; of black powerlessness.</p>
<p>Obama says that the hate doesn&rsquo;t go away. &#8220;It formed a counter-narrative buried deep within each person and at the center of which stood white people &mdash; some cruel, some ignorant, sometimes a single face, sometimes just a faceless image of a system claiming power over our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s worldview sees U.S. history as a consistent tale of oppressors and oppressed. He objects to the public schools because black kids are learning &#8220;someone else&rsquo;s history. Someone else&rsquo;s culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>He even criticizes his white grandparents, who worked hard to give him a privileged life. Their motives are a mystery to Obama because they came from the &#8220;landlocked center&#8221; of the United States, which, he asserts, is full of &#8220;suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama grew up in Hawaii, the exemplar of a melting pot of races, yet he sees it as a place of &#8220;aborted treaties and crippling diseases brought by the missionaries.&#8221; Although his mixed race was not a handicap in Hawaii, he whined that &#8220;we were always playing on the white man&rsquo;s court .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by the white man&rsquo;s rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama immersed himself in the writings of radical blacks: Richard Wright, W.E.B. DuBois, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin and Langston Hughes. Obama&rsquo;s favorite became Malcolm X.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama described his happiness in going to Kenya: &#8220;For the first time in my life, I felt the comfort, the firmness of identity that a name might provide.&#8221; He felt he &#8220;belonged&#8221; and had come home. Apparently, the only other place he felt at home was in Rev. Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s church in Chicago.</p>
<p>Obama rejects racial integration because it is &#8220;a one-way street&#8221; with blacks being &#8220;assimilated into the dominant culture, not the other way around.&#8221; Does he think America would be a better country if whites were assimilated into African culture?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Obama accepts the view that &#8220;black people have reason to hate.&#8221; His later book is called &#8220;The Audacity of Hope,&#8221; but his autobiography, which he has never disavowed, should be titled &#8220;The Audacity of Hate.&#8221;<br>

<p>How is it there is so much evidence out there that he is a bad character, and everyone knows about it, and still the majority are going to vote for him?</p>

			<p>White kids are encouraged to think the same way. To also empathize with the blackness of blacks. I guess Obama had a hand up in the process. Notice the more one acquiesces to this process, or is even enthusiastic about it, the farther one goes in modern &#8216;society&rsquo;.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;In his autobiography, Obama accepts the view that &#8216;black people have reason to hate.&rsquo; His later book is called &#8216;The Audacity of Hope,&rsquo; but his autobiography, which he has never disavowed, should be titled &#8216;The Audacity of Hate.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>As is not unexpected, Mrs. Schlafly gets most of this right, darn near to the penny.</p>
<p>However, she should not re-title Comrade BO&rsquo;s book &#8220;The Audacity of Hate,&#8221; but the &#8220;The Absurdity of Hate.&#8221; For therein lies the true stupidity and worthlessness of Comrade BO, an affirmative action ubermulatto who has produced nothing great in his life other than to inflame the irrational passions of nonwhites and the incorrigible self-hatred of white Marxists and even lesser white idiots. It is that overture of vapidly writhing arrogance and ignorance directed at the decent members of the white race in the USA, which Comrade BO and his Obamaniacs exude with such flagrant abandon against the realities of the situation that has seen him rise like a deadly cobra&rsquo;s hood to possibly becoming the 44th President of the United States, that cannot and should not be called anything other than absurdity.</p>
<p>A &#8220;racist&#8221; country may see this whelp of a witless white harlot and her self-chosen African pimp become its president; yet to the people who support the idea most fervently it is not enough, not by a long shot, in punishing the white race for its &#8220;sins?&#8221;</p>
<p>If that isn&rsquo;t &#8220;The Absurdity of Hate&#8221; (in glorious multicultural Technicolor) then I don&rsquo;t know what is!<br>

			<p>After I got out of the military (Obama never went), I began working and going to night college to earn my degrees (by earn I mean not only the grades but also the money to pay for them). I didn&rsquo;t realize I was also paying (out of the taxes I was paying) for Obama&rsquo;s education as well. Now there&rsquo;s nothing fair about that. You see that right?</p>

Apparently, the only other place he felt at home was in Rev. Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s church in Chicago.&#8221;</p>
<p>How brainless these whites and the white media are that support this man.  It&rsquo;s as if they&rsquo;re just too dense to accept the fact this is a man who is caught up in race and hatred for whites and white institutions.  His concentration on radical black writers who all despise whites, and Black Theology, which is nothing if it isn&rsquo;t a hateful unintelligent diatribe against all things white,  make his claims to want to be a unifier of the races absurd and disingenuous.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a preposterous imposter that blatantly lays out his prejudices against whites in general and his rejection of his white granparents so clearly any white supporting him has to  be completely insane not to realize that here is a man who gives the appearance of fairness and reason, but has expressed just exactly the opposite for the major part of his life.</p>
<p>He admitted some of his best friends are at Trinity United.  Does he forget that they rejoiced in the hate-filled anti-white rascist sermons of Jeremiah Wright, and the lunatic Pfleger, jumping and shouting their glee everytime racist vile comments were uttered?  </p>
<p>Or better yet, do the whites who support him believe these blacks are not typical of the majority of blacks across the country, even though the black contributors on CNN and Fox tell us the church is a typical black church, and many other black conservatives, like Jesse Peterson, inform us of exactly the same. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to understand how any white would justify voting for this man, because his one great aim in wanting the position of president is to advance blacks and black causes and to have the bully pulpit his heroes Malcolm X, Jeremiah Wright, W.D. Dubois, et al, never had to use to advance their anti-white hatreds.  White voters in support of Obama are the biggest traitors we have to America and traditional white Americans everywhere, and they&rsquo;re so disgusting they deserve to be second class subjects in a black society that hates them.</p>
<p>May these evil bastards rot in Hell.</p>

			<p>It appears to me that they hate each other more that anyone else. This judging fom the daily crime they inflict on each other. Instead of blaming whitey they might consider why they commit such atrocracies upon each other.</p>

			<p>I have always liked Phyllis Schlafly, Townhall, October 7, 2008 </p>
<p>Saw her as an American Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p>This piece seems a bit too strong for her, especially at her age. Some aide probably wrote it, like the aide to Ron Paul that wrote some unking words about the Black LA rioters/looters/murderers back during the Rodney King riots.</p>
<p>When outed by the (queer, Leftist) Magazine the New Republic, Ron Paul backed way down and said not only did he not write the negative anti Black comments in his newsletter, he never even read his own newsletter or he wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed it to go out under his name and then Ron Paul went back to droning on and on about F.M. economics reforms and ended getting less than 2% of the GOP primary vote.</p>
<p>I hope Schlafly wrote this and if Obama wins, she and her trained Eagle Forum Community Organizers are going to step up to the plate and battle Afrocentric Lib Marxism in an Obama White House with a Dem Congress.</p>
<p>There will be great opportunities to fight, but we will need fighters, not old Libertarian talkers.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Hey, maybe if he gets elected he will force us to segregate again. I would be all for that. They can have the west coast and the northeast.</p>

<p>Funny he should say that. Happiness would be his if only he would heed the advice of his inner voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;withdrawing into a &ldquo;smaller and smaller coil of rage.&rdquo;&ldquo;black people have reason to hate.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Appears his black half is asserting dominance over his thought processes. The downward spiral begins.</p>
<p>Sorry Obama, but it is quite ignorant of you to expect the overwhelming majority of Americans to twist and pervert our common heritage into some sort of accommodation for all your hate. Sorry you don&rsquo;t &#8216;feel good&rsquo; about yourself. Not my job.  Not America&rsquo;s job. Suck it up and stop the hate. Stop the whining. </p>
<p>It seems so hard for hyphenated citizens and America haters to take responsibility for their personal problems. Easier to blame others. Simple solution. Pick up the phone and purchase an airline ticket. One way. Obama was happy in Kenya? Sounds like a good start. </p>

			<p>He objects to the public schools because black kids are learning &ldquo;someone else&rsquo;s history. Someone else&rsquo;s culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is an out and out lie! A hundred studies have proven that blacks going to public schools do not have the least idea of either culture or history. Their own &#8220;culture&#8221;, such as Kwanzaa, is something that has no basis in any black culture and was only invented to fill in the void. Should they wish, I could supply a dozen swahili sounding festivals, the only problem is that none of the African Americans or their ancestors had anything to do with that culture. I dare say that all this does prove is than none of learned anything about geography.</p>

			<p>The column points out &#8220;Obama stews about injustices that he never personally experienced&#8221;, But why? because there&rsquo;s no votes for a happy blak man, that&rsquo;s why. If there is one thing Obama knows, it&rsquo;s white guilt, and he knows white folk don&rsquo;t vote for happy blak dudes. Obama&rsquo;s persona is calculated to tap into the white races&rsquo;s desperate desire to be liked by blaks, so Obama needs a touch of &#8220;angry blak man&#8221;, just enough to generate some guilt, not enough to scare YT.</p>

			<p>Notice how Obama&rsquo;s father abandoned him, just like most African men abandon their children.  Notice, however, that his white grandparents took him in and raised him, and gave him everything that he needed to succeed.  In addition, white taxpayers paid for his K-12 education, and also paid his way to Harvard.  Obama was surrounded by love, white privilege, and white civilization most of his life and benefited by it immensely.  So, what does he do?  He doesn&rsquo;t write a book about how wonderful his grandparents were, or how thankful and lucky he is to have been raised in America – instead he writes a book about his father (who abandoned him), the Black race, and how Whites are abusing Africans.  Later he chastises his White Grandmother because she was wary of black men on dark streets.  What an ungrateful person.  What a slimy thing to do. </p>

			<p>Some information on Obama&rsquo;s commie terrorist connections.</p>
<p>1981-1983[William Ayers and Barack Obama meet at Columbia?]</p>
<p>1987 William Ayers links up with Barack Obama in Chicago</p>
<p>1988 Ayers solicits Khalid Al-Mansour to raise money for Obama&rsquo;s Harvard law School education</p>
<p>1989 Tom Ayers and William Ayers get Obama a summer job at Sidley &amp; Austin (where he meets Michelle Obama); Ayers&rsquo; wife Bernadine Dohrn also worked at Sidley at about the same time as Barack and Michelle.</p>
<p>1993 Ayers places Obama on Woods Foundation</p>
<p>1995 Ayers makes Obama Chairman of Annenberg Challenge</p>
<p>1995 Ayers hosts a coffee klatch for Obama&rsquo;s political debut (Obama falsely claims this is when he met Ayers)</p>
<p>2007-2008 The structure of Obama&rsquo;s presidential campaign increasingly comes to resemble an Ayers-designed national &ldquo;community organizer matrix&rdquo; straight out of Maoist theory. This is not merely a presidential &ldquo;campaign.&rdquo; Obama&rsquo;s organization is the first installment of an ongoing movement being paid for with tax-exempt contributions to his campaign, approaching half a billion dollars.</p>
<p>2008 Obama In response to ABC News, Obama tells a national TV audience he was &ldquo;six years old&rdquo; when Ayers bombed federal buildings, and they are only casual neighborhood acquaintances. A lie.<br>

			<p>I am amazed by his Autobiography and the points made by Miss Schalafly. I find no difference between Obama and those he would emulate once in power. The Venezualan dictator felt the same way about the gringos of America. It is not good for a person to stay in a unhealthy relationship, and that is what some blacks and power seekers like Obama have done. If I felt this distaste for the very folks that give birth to me, raised me and have hugged, kissed, and followed my run for the highest office in our land then why? why would he look in the smiling faces of what he must consider are fools that are unaware of the punishment they have in store. God help America.</p>

			<p>Sounds like what Senator Obama would really like, what would really feed his soul, is to preside over an all black nation.  I for one would be happy to split up the USA today if we could in turn have a white homeland.  </p>
<p>His autobiography should be warning to us all.  Despite being of mixed heritage where his white mothers parents provided all the real loving relationships in his childhood he still hates whites and clings to his blackness.  The lesson that I draw from this is that blacks will never allow themselves to be loyal to the United States.  We will never be able to trust their motives or their actions when empowered.</p>

I was brainwashed by the public schools while he was brainwashed by the $1800 a month prep school and I had to learn the hard way the truth. He is from a generation of blacks that was handed everything, and from a family [the white side anyway] that handed him everything else. What the hell does he have to be angry about? He is going to be given this election on a silver platter, in part due to the fact that white guilt idiots will vote for him to be &#8220;a part of history&#8221;.<br>

He is yet another black (or half-black) who bemoans &#8220;hatred&#8221; when allegedly practiced by Whites, but then finds a multitude of excuses to practice it himself.</p>

			<p>&#8220;blacks being assimilated into the dominant culture, not the other way around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, Obama, and many other blacks resent being expected to live up to the dominant cultural norms of the West and particularly those of America.</p>
<p>Really, now? White civilization is supposed to adapt to black &#8220;civilization,&#8221; which is really the absence of civilization altogether.  Sub-Sahara black Africa never made it into the Stone Age materially, culturally, or socially.  And he expects the white European race to descend to the level of black Africa?</p>
<p>Well, maybe that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed, like it or not, for we seem to have an odd and suicidal lack of any sense for our self-preservation.  But those who succeed us as the dominant culture on this earth, most likely the Chinese, are not likely to surrender their hard-won gains so easily.  Their approach to dealing with them will most likely be to simply exterminate them, not necessarily through mass slaughter but more likely with the pitiless application of eugenics. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Hey, maybe if he gets elected he will force us to segregate again. I would be all for that. They can have the west coast and the northeast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why give away any land?  As far as I can see, if we were to segregate, it would be a fight for the whole pie.  They can go back to Kenya if that is the place they prefer or we can go back to Europe, in which case we&rsquo;ll have to kick out the muslims again.  Hell, everyone ought to just go home since we&rsquo;re fantasizing.  We&rsquo;ll all start over a little wiser about the benefits of tribalism and the problems with integration.</p>

			<p>What more does this guy WANT??!! He has a white mother, was raised by whites, and was educated white. Now he&rsquo;s a candidate for president of the United States. And he still has a &#8220;nightmare vision&#8221; of black powerlessness and a &#8220;counter-narrative buried deep&#8221;!</p>
<p>His white grandparents&rsquo; motives are a mystery, eh? How about that they saw him as their flesh &amp; blood, and  &mdash;  at the very least  &mdash;  felt an obligation to him in light of his birth parents&rsquo; flakeiness? We white people tend to do things like that&hellip;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m voting for Obama. I don&rsquo;t think black people are ready for one of their own  &mdash;  if that&rsquo;s what they consider him  &mdash;  as president. But I just can&rsquo;t reward the Republicans, who act as if they haven&rsquo;t been running things for the entire adult life of many young voters, with four more years to crash-and-burn the country once and for all.</p>
<p>Anybody see the video of Palin in church, doing a laying-on-of-hands with that Alaskan separatist minister who has declared that he isn&rsquo;t no gul-durned American and would as soon see America disappear? I, personally, would like someone smarter than the average suburban soccer mom a heartbeat away from the presidency.</p>
<p>Anyone who has no better judgment than to name somebody like Palin as his running mate, then let her throw stones from her glass house about Obama serving on a community board with a &#8220;known terrorist&#8221;, doesn&rsquo;t deserve my vote.</p>

			<p>I honestly believe, from the bottom of my heart, that Obama is more radical, and more &#8220;anti-white,&#8221; than either Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton.  He is more akin to Louis Farrakhan.  Of course, Obama can&rsquo;t reveal that to the citizens of the country whose highest office he aspires to occupy, for the vast majority of those citizens, the very people on whose votes he vitally depends and to whom, ironically, he is now ingratiating himself, are white. </p>
<p>But make no mistake about it: Obama loves this country about as much as Jeremiah Wright, Louis Farrakhan, Bill Ayers, Bernadine Dohrn, and Michael Pfleger love it. He wants to be President not because he loves America, but because he craves the power to remake this country in his own image. </p>
<p>This is why he will not win. </p>

			<p>deliberately separated himself from his multiracial heritage in order to give himself a 100 percent black persona</p>
<p>In many ways, Obama is the ultimate self-hating white.  He&rsquo;s actually 3% black (and 0% african american), half white and the rest arab.  He may LOOK black but he most definitely is not.  Most blacks who look to him do not know this about him.  But black leaders absolutely know this (Jesse Jackson typifies how they REALLY feel about him).  He is nothing more than a useful tool to them.</p>
<p>What motivates him is not love of his own (black) race.  That&rsquo;s a lie he tells people for political reasons. What motivates him is hatred of his own (white) race.</p>

			<p>Never underestimate human stupidity.  As such, I predict an Obama victory.  People vote with their pocketbook.  The economy is in shambles.  Blame for the ailing economy has successfully been draped around Republicans.</p>
<p>An Obama administration will be fraught with racial consciousness, and there will be no end to persons unfairly being labeled racists when they oppose Obama and his fanatic leftists.  Raising corporate taxes will cause more companies to leave our shores.  Since the top one per cent of taxpayers create 80 per cent of the new jobs, how many jobs are going to be created.  By throttling the private sector, socialist Obama will find tax payment dwindling because people will not be able to make money.  There will be huge revenue shortfall.  I myself own a factory all of whose product is sold abroad.  My employees who own portions of the enterprise and myself have decided that should Obama win the election, we&rsquo;ll likely take the entire operation to Panama where we&rsquo;ve been promised no corporate taxes whatsoever.  Even under the present tax schedule we would see a 35 per cent increase in profits.  We&rsquo;ll save even more as Obama cripples private enterprise by increasing American corporate taxes to the highest in the industrial world.  We&rsquo;ve worked hard to make our company a success, and we intend to enjoy the fruits of our labor, not share it with welfare chiselers.</p>

			<p>   The only reason, (as all of us here know) Obama made it this far is the shameful, sycophantic treatment of him by the media. I truly believe that if Obama was vetted properly at the beginning, he would have never made it out of the primaries; probably finishing near the bottom. The media have not just given him a free ride, they have greased the rails.</p>
<p>    I would love to see the &#8220;journalism&#8221; diplomas of top people at AP, CNN, NBC, etc., thrown into a pile and burned for all to see. That would truly be a protest with a point. </p>

			<p>The way we write, and what we write about, says a lot about who we are. It doesn&rsquo;t say everything, but it says a lot. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons I enjoy the Internet so much. I read constantly, it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing to do. There are different things to read and different kinds of reading. News articles read fast, Classics read slow. That kinda thing. They require different ways of thinking and responding. A news article must be easy to understand, whereas no Classic is ever going to yield its cargo on demand. But both have something to say.<br>
It&rsquo;s why I value the comments here, and not just here, and try to read as many as I can. They are written by people who have something to say, and though they may lack the right means of expression, what they do say comes from the heart.  There is no pretence. It&rsquo;s a quality they share with great writers. The difference with great writers is the sheer talent, even genius, and fundamental brainwork, and ability to organize style and content in a way that is original. It&rsquo;s writing that bears the mark of what the West is all about - Individuality.</p>
<p>Why mention all of that in a response to an article on Obama?</p>
<p>Because Obama has none of those qualities.  And yet, predictably, he is constantly refered to as a great writer, and even by people who should know better. He&rsquo;s not. To be blunt, he has the bad habit of so many Black writers, ie; their uncanny knack for oversimplifying an important point using lots of words.<br>
They dumb-down an important subject like Race and cover it up with lots and lots of nonsense in the form of so many unnecessary words.<br>
They do it so often, and seem to have no control over what they write, that they simplify to the point of misrepresentation, even distortion, so that the reader constantly feels lost, or on the verge of it.<br>
It shows us that, as a writer, he is not a straight shooter, and does not respect his readers, because he is too self-absorbed, and too impressed with himself, at the same time.  And, for me, this suggests a man with something to hide. Behind all of that pretence and oversimplification he is hiding something, from us, and above all - from himself.<br>
Like I said, the way we write, and what we write about, says a lot about who we are. It might not say everything, but it says a lot.<br>

He and his wife or both Anti-White Anti-American bigots. His refusal to pledge the flag, and Michelle&rsquo;s slip up about it being the first time she was ever proud of her country, is proof alone how deep their anti-American feelings are. And the very fact that he looked upon Reverend Wright as a mentor speaks volumes about their hatred for the white race. I would almost prefer to have Jesse Jackson in office, at least the public would be able to see what they were getting.</p>

			<p><i>Obama describes how he deliberately separated himself from his multiracial heritage in order to give himself a 100 percent black persona, different and alienated from the white world around him. Obama writes that the book is &ldquo;a record of a personal, interior journey&rdquo; to establish himself as &ldquo;a black American.&rdquo;  </i><br>
  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
I suspect that,  rather than making a deliberate choice in favor of being black, it was a case where he really had no choice. No choice at all.  In American society, he COULD NOT  be white, so he had no choice but to be black.   What else could he be?  He&rsquo;s making it look as if he made the choice himself.</p>

No, McCain would have to get impossibly lucky for a scandal of those proportions to be uncovered. <br>

			<p> Those who will be most surprised in the aftermath of an Obama victory will be the current Democratic power structure.<br>
 When the Dems took control of Congress, there were members of the Congressional Black Caucus who expected to be in higher positions on powerful committees but Pelosi would have none of it. There was even one CBC member who expected to be a chairman but was bypassed.<br>
 With an Obama victory, the identity politics of the Democratic party will come into play as ALL members of the CBC will expect &#8220;reparations&#8221; in the form of taking greater Congressional power. Then, much like a Mafia gang war, revenge will be taken on their &#8220;comrades&#8221; for perceived grievences.<br>

			<p>Obama felt at home in Kenya becuase Kenya is truly his home.  A Philadelphia-area lawyer, Philip Berg, has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Obama was actually born in Kenya and has -and may still - claim Indonesian citizenship as an adult.  In other words, Obama may not be qualified to act as President, or even as Senator, for that matter.  </p>
<p>The case is pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Philip Berg v. Barack Obama, et al., Case No. 2:08-cv-04083-RBS.  The pleadings are available free online at numerous sites, yet the MSM has completely ignored the entire case.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth checking out simply for the numerous aliases used by BHO during his lifetime.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a tidbit from Dean Reynolds, ABC News, which probably signals what to expect from an Obama presidency in general, which is telling us of things to come.  We might have a third world candidate running:</p>
<p>&#8220;The McCain campaign plane is better than Obama&rsquo;s, which is cramped, uncomfortable and smells terrible most of the time. Somehow the McCain folks manage to keep their charter clean, even where the press is seated.&#8221;</p>
<p>To me that&rsquo;s the audacity of cleanliness, which never seems to be present in anything black. <br>

			<p>Someone mentioned that they don&rsquo;t know how whites can vote for obamba.<br>
Some neighbors are voting for obamba, or at least for their party. These neighbors are nice people, in spite of being democrats, and that seems to be a key motivating factor in this election. Party members are so desperate to have a dem in the white house that anybody, and I mean anybody, who runs on that ticket gets their vote, no questions asked, no questions brought up are answered. Party loyalty is all.<br>
Sounds kind of like nazi germany, eh?</p>

			<p>&#8220;they (Bad writers and Obama) simplify to the point of misrepresentation, even distortion, so that the reader constantly feels lost, or on the verge of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a contradiction? Writers you don&rsquo;t like constantly oversimplify and yet you still find it hard to decipher what they are trying to say? They &#8220;oversimplify an important point by using lots of words&#8221;.</p>
<p>Looking back at what you wrote, have you accomplished the very thing you would claim bad writers do? Draw things out and oversimplify and yet still not make clear what it is exactly you mean? Are you providing a living example for us to ponder on?</p>

			<p>The thought streaming out of Barack&rsquo;s head is vacuous, literally; there is a vacuum on the subject of race in this country and the themes enunciated by Barack and other black race types reflects this nothingness. No resistance to push against results in no specificity; no real complaints since with AA, housing favors, and political correctness the essential balance has shifted towards them. I think the failures of blacks to even live up to their own expectations, much less to those of the globalized world we live in is crushing the conscientious amongst them with shame. Others it leaves simply dazed. In a few decades the competitiveness of the USA will be non-issue as Asia passes us by and the whole race crusade will be seen for what it is: a huge waste of time, an errand to nowhere. Resentful, insecure blacks and aztecs will never out-produce East Asians with a world to conquer.</p>

			<p>Obama rejects racial integration because it is &ldquo;a one-way street&rdquo; with blacks being &ldquo;assimilated into the dominant culture, not the other way around.&rdquo; Does he think America would be a better country if whites were assimilated into African culture? (What Culture?)</p>
<p><br>
This is a prime example of a distorted mulatto whose mind is ill defined and contaminated with the satanic ideology of black Liberation theology. He hates the white side of himself, the side who nourished him and embraces the black communist side that abandoned him. <br>
His books are as mind numbing as he is and are simply worthless. </p>
<p>This Obama creature was presented to the American people five years ago  by CNN and 60 minutes, as &#8220;America&rsquo;s rising star&#8221; based on his book, who could be America&rsquo;s first Black president. </p>

<p>As far as the &#8220;blacks have reason to hate&#8221; comment goes, why then do they flock to white countries, instead of leaving them in droves?  A more honest description would have been &#8220;blacks are spoiled children who love to complain&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s worldview sees U.S. history as a consistent tale of oppressors and oppressed. He objects to the public schools because black kids are learning &ldquo;someone else&rsquo;s history. Someone else&rsquo;s culture.&rdquo;<br>
Here&rsquo;s a great idea Hussein Obama, take your oppressed black kids pickup and go to Kenya. It will be there that you will find paradise, happiness and able to learn Kenyan history which is rich in many accomplishments.<br>
You could become the Minister of Rum and spices, a position I am sure well suited for. Current president Mwai Kibaki can use a guy like you!<br>
And just image this in your little mind Obama, no white history (with its accomplishment) to learn, just the two pages in the Kenyan history book.</p>

			<p>   I&rsquo;ve lost alot of friends and have estranged families members because of the lying left and obama. For some odd reason, these friends and family members of mine cannot figure out that the leftist unions and the communists are backing obama. The big unions that were once the saviours of the working people have become gorged with communists and all other sorts of anarchists that would destroy us. Too many working whites and blacks have been told that obama is their saviour. All too many times when I would discuss politics with them at family get-togethers, they would say, bottom line, whomever says they will help them personally, is who they will vote for. Their bottom line is: me, me, me, me,, to Hell with everybody else. I have cancelled all get-togethers for the rest of the year with these friends and family members. Actually, I have disowned several of them for betraying not only their own race, but the country.</p>

<p>The point  about  humans  &mdash;  as  opposed  to  non-human animals  &mdash;  is  that  they  are  hardwired to express  agency  in terms  of  decision-making.</p>
<p>If  BHO  were  to  become  president of the  U.S. his  adminstration  should  necessarily  be  judged  in terms  of  its  agency  &mdash;  i.e.  its decisions.  BHO  just  cannot  be  a  dictator  given  the  constraints  imposed  by  the  U.S.  constitution  &mdash;  which  he  probably  knows  by  heart, given  that  he  taught  constitutional  law  for  a number  of  years.</p>

			<p>As I have written before here, Obama is the messiah that the underground and above ground left has been waiting for all these years.  Bill and Hillary Clinton came close but no cigar (pardon the pun).  That&rsquo;s what Hillary wouldn&rsquo;t or couldn&rsquo;t understand.  That the powerful machine, money and otherwise, that propelled her adulterous and lying husband to the White House would not be there for her. Who could possible argue that our Founding Fathers never intended for someone like him to become President. They would have been had not the great one come along - Barrack Hussein Obama.  He is and has everything they wanted in a presidential candidate.  He&rsquo;s black.  He&rsquo;s completely left of center and he believes in everything they do.  Unfettered abortion,even if the baby is born alive, income redistribution (fairness in their dictionary), national healthcare - even if it breaks the country, unlimited spending on pet social projects and programs.  Of course, Hillary was for all these things too but she was the one thing he isn&rsquo;t WHITE.  </p>
<p>How else could some one like him, a complete nobody be chosen to give the keynote speech at the 2004 Democrat Convention.  I never heard of this guy until then and I didn&rsquo;t even watch that convention.  Then 4 years later, he has the support of every left wing organization, every crazy Hollywood looney, Oprah Winfrey, the mainstream media and even in his father&rsquo;s home country of Kenya, they are rooting for him to win.  </p>
<p>I can understand why 95% of the blacks in this country are voting for him.  It&rsquo;s the same reason that 95% of blacks in 1994 believed OJ got a raw deal.  I&rsquo;d say that 1/2 of the 95% have no idea of who he is except that he is black.  And I can understand the radical left with its Bill Ayers and Bernandine Dohrns and Reverend Wrights.  I can even understand the looney Hollyweird crowd.  They&rsquo;re all a bunch of communists anyway.  But it&rsquo;s the everyday whites in this country that I don&rsquo;t understand.  Maybe they are voting for him because it&rsquo;s the trendy thing to do and it is possible that a majority of whites are saying out loud for the cameras that they are voting for him but won&rsquo;t when they get behind that voting booth curtain.  26 days will tell.  </p>

			<p>There is a new book on Obama by Webster G. Tarpley called <br>
Barack H. Obama: The Unauthorized Biography </p>
<p>Buy at Amazon!!!- </p>
<p>Help is needed to get this book&rsquo;s probing analysis of this sick manikin Obama and the networks behind him out. Go to Amazon to purchase the book and tell your friends.</p>
<p>This would be very valuable in understanding why Obama has been allowed and abetted in getting where he is now as an agent of Wall Street &amp; as the new politically correct face <br>
of fascist imperialism.It would be exactly in the oligarchy&rsquo;s interest to run a candidate who hates America</p>
<p>Buy the book and see the deeper story as regards Terrorist Bill Ayers and his connection with the Ford Foundation etc It is the role of the foundations such as Ford of which Obama&rsquo;s mother was an agent. This is important. </p>

			<p>Will you please stop characterizing Black Africa as Stone Age or Pre-Stone Age? Will you please stop saying that they had metalworking or agriculture on contact? </p>
<p>Proto-agriculture developed in Africa in the Central African Republic around 12,000 YBP. Real primitive agriculture developed among proto-Mande speakers in the Niger headwaters YBP. That beats Europe. Between 4000-9000 years ago, agriculture developed independently in the Sahel, West Africa and Ethiopia. This includes the full array including animal husbandry. Black Africa had the full array of ag before Egyptians did. On contact, most of Black Africans had long been practicing ag and almost all had long had ironworking. The exceptions are the primitive, archaic Khoisan and Pygmies.</p>
<p>African ironworking goes back maybe 3000 years. On contact, almost all modern Africans had ironworking. Some of the smelting techniques were so advanced that their counterparts were not discovered in Europe until the 1800&rsquo;s.</p>

I agreed with your post, up to this point, Mark.  But I&rsquo;m not sure that they will EVER see this for what it is and admit it. Just like the finincial crisis we now have before us, everyone will be denying everything,  and lying and obfuscating, and everyone will be pointing the finger at everyone else.  But no one will ever admit their guilt.  It will always be somebody else.<br>

			<p>This is certainly a prime example of the &#8220;one drop&#8221; rule that was called racist, but yet is so true.  He&rsquo;s half white, yet he identifies with his black side exclusively.  I&rsquo;ve seen it first hand with a half white co-worker.  When she&rsquo;s around whites, she talks normally, but when she gets around blacks, the &#8220;I be,&#8221; &#8220;we be,&#8221; talk starts.  She&rsquo;s a big Obama supporter and I had to complain to management because she was soliciting donations for his campaign at work, which is strictly against company policy and ethics.</p>
<p>I initially, thought McCain would probably win this election, but with this economy free fall engineered by Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Chris Dodd, Barney Frank, and a few other benevolent Democrats, stupid white voters are going to blame the party of the incumbent President and &#8220;teach the Republicans a lesson.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m not exactly pleased with the Republican party myself, but it beats the alternative.</p>
<p>If Obama is elected, the America we knew and loved, will cease to exist.  Get ready to watch America slide people.</p>

<p>This always makes me boil with rage everytime I see or hear a statement like this.  What the hell does this mean anyway?  If you are going to an AMERICAN public school, shouldn&rsquo;t they teach the history of AMERICA? </p>
<p>I come from mainly Irish decent, but I never expected to be taught a full history of Ireland and the Irish people in school.  It was something I sought out on my own and didn&rsquo;t expect everyone else to have to learn as well.</p>
<p>What do they want?! A history lesson on Africa? Here it is:</p>
<p>Africans were running around digging in the dirt for hundreds of thousands of years, then the Europeans came along and enslaved some of them and ultimately gave them every technological advance that they have today.  The End.</p>

<p>Gosh, really? In fact, that is exactly what we ought to worry about, given B. Hussein Obama&rsquo;s track record of &#8220;decisions,&#8221; and those of his African brethren.</p>
<p>&#8220;BHO just cannot be a dictator given the constraints imposed by the U.S. constitution &mdash; which he probably knows by heart, given that he taught constitutional law for a number of years.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you think the Constitution acts as a restraint upon Washington you are thoroughly ignorant of American politics. The Constitution does not authorize the federal government to earmark a percentage of income taxation for redistribution to Africa, but that is a measure B. Hussein Obama supports. Moreover there is a difference between &#8220;knows&#8221; and &#8220;acknowledges the authority of.&#8221;</p>

<p>I know for sure that they set the orginal Weatherman &ldquo;bombs&rdquo; with Obama&rsquo;s CRA law suits  to force banks to grant affirmative action mortgages. then they infiltrated Fannie &amp; Freddie (not hard to do run by Dems), then they infect banks and investment banks with the subprime virus.</p>
<p>Next they picked off the companies one by one using shorting, options to short and credit default swaps (CDS). Do you know what CDS are? Using these three tools plus rumors, message board bashing etc it is easy for a groups of hedge funds to take down these banks, mortgages firms, AIG and investment banks. Many hedge fund managers worked at these companies as traders. This was like shooting fish in a barrel.</p>
<p>This is fact.</p>
<p>Driving the market down now when you and assorted hedge funds have at least $50 billion capital before leverage? Easy.</p>
<p>They have some extremely wealthy people involved. Including one very famous folksy mega billionaire who owns a majority stake in Wells Fargo that picked up Wachovia for a song. He made a few billion on one deal in a week.</p>
<p>Google &ldquo;Cloward Piven Obama&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question is how long can they hold the markets down to benefit Obama? If they wrecked the global financial system it might be for quite a while.</p>
<p>Odd how this mega down day occurred right after Cox at the SEC lifted the ban on shorting financials.</p>

There is going to be a separation of the races in this country either peaceful or via war, because whites can&rsquo;t continue to support people who have been in the stone-age for 5000 years, who never had a written language nor invented the wheel.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s make this separation peaceful, eh?  You can have a couple of states; the Hispanics can have a couple; the leftists can live with either of you.

<p>Gayle your post is interesting and I followed it right up until you made this sentence.  Why not Hillary?  She believes in everything the radical left covets so why would a black be something essential to their plans?  Blacks generally are unsophisticated in their voting patterns and Hillary or any other White liberal would draw the black vote no matter who the nominee is.  It seems to me his race is a hindrance to winning among other things.  Forget the polls, they&rsquo;re lying just like the media is.  The gallup poll moves in his favor one point every day.  I refuse to believe that people think that someone who has no knowledge of economics or anything else, never owned a business and has lived off the public dole for his success, would be better for the economy.   <br>

OBAMA MAKES A HUGE BUY  [of TV time]<br>
  <i>Such a vast purchase of commercial time is a multimillion-dollar expense, but Obama has been spending dramatically on ads, overshadowing rival John McCain&hellip;  &#8220;It&rsquo;s a luxury to be able to afford that kind of communication,&#8221; said Tad Devine, a Democratic media consultant.   That Obama has the ability to buy such a huge block of prime time is a testament to his prodigious fundraising.  He has not been shy about spending it.  On Monday, for instance, he spent $3.3 million in a single day of TV advertising. At that rate he will spend more than $90 million on ads through Election Day  &mdash;  more than all the money Republican rival John McCain has to spend on his entire fall campaign.</i></p>

<p>Someone here on this board once explained to me that blacks think the wealth that whites create are somehow a natural part of the landscape like lakes or trees. They think that evil whitey has simply taken all the nice houses and neighborhoods for themselves and refuse to share it with the blacks.  When the government mandates that we turn over a portion of our hard-earned wealth to them, they destroy whatever is given to them. Truly, they are parasites.<br>

			<p>Has everyone seen the soviet communist style campaigning Obama&rsquo;s desciples have been engaging in. It&rsquo;s like early communism with the cult like feel about them. Really sick and weird. Signs of things to come I&rsquo;m sure of it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Will you please stop characterizing Black Africa as Stone Age or Pre-Stone Age? &#8220;</p>
<p>Posted by Robert Lindsay at 5:33 PM on October 9 </p>
<p>Puh leeze Robert, don&rsquo;t waste your time posting your African studies fantisies and falsehoods on this board.  We too went to college and were brainwashed with African fantasies and falsehoods but we resisted the brainwashing.</p>
<p>When the Portguese first landed in both Angola and S. Africa, they noted that in both those places the natives did have fire, but they had not yet advanced to cooking and ate all their food and meat raw.  This was in the early and mid 1400&rsquo;s AD.</p>
<p>So it is hard to believe that a people who had not yet discovered cooking in 1450 AD developed agriculture in 12,000 BC.</p>
<p>And in the 1700&rsquo;s AD many European explorers noted that some African tribes had not yet figured out that sexual intercourse resulted in conception.  They thought that magical trees, rocks or springs caused conception.<br>

			<p>Once again, Phyllis Schlafly shows why she is a legend among conservative American women, and has been for decades. Hooray!</p>
<p>ALL races, nationalities, and societies have sufficient reasons to HATE&hellip;.yes, even whites. Hate was not invented by the white man, nor does he have a monopoly on hate. If anything, the white man has much more to complain about than many others. Sometimes, people give in to hate and war is the inevitable result. It is actually unusual for all sides to war to be equally animated by hate, thus the haters are the aggressors and the defenders are forced to learn to hate the invaders.</p>
<p>That is the problem with the current invasion of the USA by illegal aliens. The American people have yet to hate and despise the invaders with sufficient fevor to drive them back across the border&hellip;..but we are learning&hellip;..quickly it seems.</p>
<p>War may start because of the agitation to hate by one group of people. But the real contest begins when all parties to the war learn to hate sufficiently to draw blood and kill. We may not have much longer to wait.<br>

			<p>Blacks have to drum up these justifications for their natural hostility.  Those who know them, know that they experience a condition known as the &#8220;pressure cooker&#8221; effect.  If they were confined to just their own kind they treat each other like Africans are doing now.  When they get released from that &#8220;pressure cooker&#8221; environment, as they were in USA by desegregation,  they express it on others.</p>
<p>What are they and all the other hostile peoples of the earth going to do when there aren&rsquo;t any &#8220;evil whites&#8221; to direct their hostility towards?  They&rsquo;ll have to find another scapegoat.</p>

			<p>Here is what I always assumed about Obama and his commie grandparents and Mother.  I got the first clues when I read his disgusting &#8220;Audacity of Hope.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Having been around a lot of ultra leftists when I worked for the City and County of San Francisco, I recognized a lot of the signs. The city was totally inundated with Ann Dunham types; young adult commie children of communist parents, all well off and equipped with Ivy League degrees. They worked for those Johnson Nixon war on poverty programs during the 1970&rsquo;s. The major criteria for a white person getting a job in those programs was to have good communist credentials and references.</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of us who had to go to work at career type jobs when we finished school, these wealthy revolutionaries could afford to take a few years to foment revolution.</p>
<p>I am positive that Brinks robber and murderer of 2 police officers Kathy Boudin worked for a war on poverty program in San Francisco during the early 1970&rsquo;s while she was on the run from the FBI.</p>
<p>So I learned their evil ways and as soon as I read Obama&rsquo;s book I knew what he is, a third generation communist.</p>
<p>And Obama&rsquo;s grandparents 1940&rsquo;s generation of communists were directed to encourage their daughters to marry either American black men or non white foreigners to raise children who would carry on the revolution into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Obama is the result of the communist breeding program.</p>
<p>I have also wondered exactly why his Mother targetted an Indonesian for her second husband.  Remember, during the time she was married to the Indonesian there was practically a civil war going on between the government of Indonesia and communist insurgents. As soon as the government won the war she separated from her Indonesian husband.</p>
<p>Please note that it was Stanley Dunham, Obama&rsquo;s grandfather who introduced Obama to Frank Davis and according to Obama&rsquo;s book, drove him to Frank&rsquo;s house a couple times a week.  </p>
<p>And who helped pay for that expensive private school?  The only person in the family who had a job was the grandmother, Madelyn.  Grandpa wasn&rsquo;t working but wasn&rsquo;t old enough to draw social security.  Perpetual student Mom was still in school. She finally got her Master&rsquo;s about the time Obama started college.</p>
<p>Madelyn was a bank vice president.  But bank salaries are  about the lowest paid office work.  Even bank vice presidents make very little compared to other fields.  And in those days, executive women earned a lot less than men in similiar positions. </p>
<p>Obama has been a commie sleeper agent since birth.  So was his Mother.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s Red Mentor Was a Pervert</p>
<p><br>
AIM Column  |  By Cliff Kincaid  |  August 24, 2008  </p>
<p>Covering a sensitive and explosive subject that has been off-limits for the major U.S. media, the London Daily Telegraph is now claiming that Communist Frank Marshall Davis was a strong influence over a young Barack Obama for nine years of his life, rather than just four, and was a sex pervert and pothead. The Telegraph article alleges that Davis was a bisexual engaged in &ldquo;sordid&rdquo; sexual activities and had repeated sexual encounters with a 13-year-old girl.</p>
<p>In an article headlined, &ldquo;Frank Marshall Davis, alleged Communist, was early influence on Barack Obama,&rdquo; writer Toby Harnden confirms everything Accuracy in Media has been reporting since February about the mysterious &ldquo;Frank&rdquo; in Obama&rsquo;s book being Communist Party USA (CPUSA) member Frank Marshall Davis. Harnden is the Daily Telegraph&rsquo;s U.S. Editor, based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; in the headline is misleading, since there is no doubt that Davis, who was investigated by the FBI and various congressional and official inquiries, was a CPUSA member. </p>
<p>In fact, as AIM has documented, Davis was involved in the CPUSA or its front activities, before, during and after World War II, and became a member of a secret communist apparatus in the 1950s after the CPUSA in Hawaii was reorganized on an underground basis. ( Is this why the communist Dunham family moved to Hawaii)?      Davis died in 1987. ( He was also expelled form the Hawaii NAACP when they discovered his communist party membership.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although identified only as Frank in Mr. Obama&rsquo;s memoir Dreams from My Father, it has now been established that he was Frank Marshall Davis, a radical activist and journalist who had been suspected of being a member of the Communist Party in the 1950s,&rdquo; Harnden reported.</p>
<p>Davis wasn&rsquo;t just a &ldquo;suspected&rdquo; communist but a key CPUSA member involved in an important Soviet-sponsored network. The communists had targeted Hawaii largely because of its strategic location and importance to the U.S. defense effort. The CPUSA, which was controlled by the Soviet Communist Party, was receiving funding from the Soviet Communist Party through KGB channels as late as the 1980s.<br>

			<p>Some have wondered how this could be happening.  I truly do not believe that it is a coincidence.  Just like the other crippling depression that brought about the welfare state that has existed to this day, this is the final touch to finishing off our supposedly free country.  The allegory of the frog in the increasingly hot water pot comes to mind; in small increments, slowly but surely our country has been taken over by the American and global Communists who want a one world order government.  However, I am of the belief that there is a Western (USA and G.B., etc.) Communist and an Eastern Communist(China and Russia, etc.), and one day they are going to battle it out for dominance.  </p>
<p>Look at this link, and tell me all of these things are not here, right now.<br>

The Dutch colonists, advancing northwards from their original outposts, met the black Bantu people as they moved south from their original homelands.  I think it likely that the Blacks had cooking.<br>
     Some East African Blacks also had iron.  I assume that they learned about it from Arabs, since they never developed the technology beyond its simplest form, burning a piece of ore until the molten metal ran out into a hole in the ground shaped like the tool they were trying to make.  </p>

			<p>12:33 PM:</p>
<p>As schoolteacher implies, ALL of modern Africans had both the full array of agriculture and metallurgy - the top form - ironworking. </p>
<p>There are a few modern tribes in Kenya and Madagascar that were hunter-gatherers, but 98% of modern Africans had agriculture, usually in full array. There was no ag nor metallurgy in Africa south of the Equator before 2000 YBP. But the people down there were all archaic Africans - Khoisan and Pygmies. The Bantu exploded out of Cameroon 2000 years ago and rapidly spread through all of southern Africa. Secret? Metallurgy and agriculture. The archaics had neither, but there were no plants or animals that could be domesticated south of the Equator anyway.</p>
<p>Ironworking in Africa shows up 3000 years ago and does seem to have come from Carthage (Caucasoids). It rapidly spreads through the Sahel, W Africa and E Africa after that. It may have been primitive, but the Africans rapidly innovated a dizzying array of techniques in ironworking. Diss their ironworking all you want, but it&rsquo;s the highest phase of metallurgy:</p>
<p>Phase 1: Copper<br>
Phase 2: Bronze<br>
Phase 3: Iron </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to diss Africans for borrowing technology. Cultural diffusion exists. How many pure innovations are there anyway?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that modern Africans did not reach a high level of development but they did have full ag and ironworking. Those are impressive achievements right there. Aborigines, Ainu, Siberians, Eskimos, and many Amerindians never got that.</p>
<p>The archaic Africans were Stone Age hunter-gatherers. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to recognize modern African agriculture because in my opinion, this is the reason that the evolved robust body shape and high testosterone = aggression and possibly even high fertility. Complicated story but I&rsquo;ll go into it if you want to.</p>
<p>Khoisan have child-like, gracile bodies, low testosterone and low fertility. They also never got ag. Hunter-gatherers usually have lower testosterone than agriculturalists.</p>

<p>Oh, yes.  They achieved great advancement throughout Africa, didn&rsquo;t they?  They never invented even the wheel or a written language, but they did excell in civilization building because of their advanced techniques in metallurgy?</p>
<p>If anybody wants to waste time checking into it, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;ve misconstrued facts and figures as usual, because of your fixation on advancing blacks in spite of all data to the contrary.

			<p>&#8220;Someone here on this board once explained that blacks think <b>the wealth that whites create is somehow a natural part of the landscape like lakes or trees. </b> They think that evil whities have simply taken all the nice houses and neighborhoods for themselves and refuse to share it with the blacks.  When the government mandates that we turn over a portion of our hard-earned wealth to them, they  then destroy whatever is given to them.  Truly, they are parasites.&#8221;<br>
Posted by ex-liberal <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>That could have been me, or Bon. Or perhaps Mrs. Smythe.  I know we&rsquo;ve all written of it several times.  Blacks (and third worlders in general) have no concept of wealth&rsquo;s creation by virtue of human ingenuity and effort.  They have a naive, childlike assumption that wealth simply exists   &mdash;   like a gold mine or oil deposit   &mdash;   and that anyone who has too much of it has simply stolen it from someone else, instead of sharing fairly as he should.   In other words, whites are greedy, thus whites have too much.  And if you are rich, it&rsquo;s because you have made someone else poor.  As a radical French anarchist  (Prudhon) once wrote, &#8220;Property is theft!&#8221;  [La propriété, c&rsquo;est le vol!]   That puts it in a nutshell which even the most simple mind can comprehend.  And it gives them a sense of entitlement, and of justified resentment, against the &#8220;haves&#8221;  (e.g. whites).</p>
<p>Imagine a fixed amount of wealth, like a pie, and instead of dividing it up into equal slices, some greedy types have hogged more than their share, thus forcing others to be poor.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s not only the poor and backward who have this simplistic  notion. Here it gets interesting. Some extreme leftists whom I have known, who were wealthy and very well educated (at least by standard terms), children of privilege,  had basically the same notion.   It&rsquo;s worth noting that these were red-diaper babies who  <i>lived on trust funds, </i> inherited money. But they were Marxists all the way!  People like the Kennedy&rsquo;s (for example) who have never had to work a day in their lives.  They may not necessarily call themselves Marxists, but that&rsquo;s their outlook.  For them, the checks come in the mail  (or direct deposit),  and that&rsquo;s where wealth comes from    &mdash;   a check!   It&rsquo;s like city children who think food comes from a shelf in the supermarket.  In this matter, they are no different from &#8220;welfare queens&#8221; and such, who also receive their share of &#8220;wealth&#8221; by check.  To both kinds, the concept of wealth has been disassociated from  any notion of work. Both the very rich and the very poor have lost any connection with the lives of middle class people who must work to eat, who must produce in order to consume.  To them, wealth is something simply &#8220;there&#8221;  (like features of the landscape).  So they don&rsquo;t see why it shouldn&rsquo;t be shared equally.  If you have more than someone else, it&rsquo;s because you are greedy and you have stolen it from them.</p>
<p>Just look, for example,  at Obama&rsquo;s buddy, Bill Ayers, founder of the Weather Underground,  a violent organization that conducted a campaign of bombing public buildings during the &rsquo;60s and &rsquo;70s.  He&rsquo;s the  privileged son of Chicago philanthropist Thomas G. Ayers, former Chairman and CEO of Commonwealth Edison.  Bill Ayers participated in the bombings of New York City Police Headquarters in 1970, the U.S.Capitol building in 1971, and The Pentagon in 1972.  Federal charges against him were dropped on  technicalities (on the excuse that the prosecution acted in an &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; or &#8220;unfair&#8221; manner).  He never served a day in jail.  He has to this day repented NOTHING.  He is presently (get this!) a tenured professor at the University of Illinois, holding the title of  &#8220;Distinguished Professor&#8221;.  (!!!)   He&rsquo;s now a noted elementary education theorist, known for  his work in &#8220;education reform, curriculum, and instruction&#8221;.  [How nice!]  </p>
<p>Note: I wrote this before reading Margarets&rsquo; excellent post.  These people whom I mention were exactly the  &#8220;wealthy revolutionaries&#8221;  that she describes, and those &#8220;adult commie children were all well off and equipped with Ivy League degrees&#8221;.   Exactly!   Margaret said it very well.  Sounds like she and I knew the same people!</p>

<p>Testosterone?  That seems strange (not that I&rsquo;m arguing with you), since in Africa, agriculture is performed by the women   &mdash;   while the men (little more than drones) just lie around, drink their beer, and take life easy, their only traditional purpose being war and babies.</p>

<p>Most  researchers  claim  that  African  iron working was  purely  indigenous.  &#8220;The  fact  that  quenching  and  tempering were  not  employed routinely  in Africa is  good evidence that, in the details of its  practice, African ironworking developed with  little  or  no  technological input  from  outside the continent&#8221;. (Duncan Miller, University  of  Capetown, South  Africa.  &#8220;Ironworking Technology&#8221;, in  Encyclopedia of  Precolonial  Africa).</p>
<p>Your  point  about  robust  body shape  and  high  testosterone  is  tendentious.  After  all, Europeans  and  Asians did  also  develop  agriculture  and they  did  expand far  and  wide.  Do  they  also  have  &#8220;robust  body  shapes&#8221; and  &#8220;high  testosterone&#8221;? </p>

<p>The wheel is actually a more advanced achievement that the highest form of metallurgy - iron. Many cultures had metallurgy but never got the wheel. See the Amerindians. </p>
<p>Written language is probably an even further advance than a wheel. Lots of old societies had wheels but nothing written. Amerindians never had much in the way or written language either, nor did Siberians or all sorts of folks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that Africans had an advanced civilization, but the full array of ag plus the highest form of metallurgy is not too shabby. Esp compared to Stone Age hunter-gatherers.</p>
<p>By all means do look into the Iron Age in Africa. Be my guest. </p>

			<p>ghw: In primitive hunter-gatherer societies, women need men. Mostly to hunt for them, but in some societies women hunt pretty well themselves (Filipino Negrito women are better hunters than men). Anyway, women need men, so women marry off pretty early. They just grab the nearest guy around. There is little competition for females and most guys end up with one. Primitive agricultural societies in Africa and New Guinea have evolved males with the highest testosterone levels on Earth. Keep in mind that modern Blacks are a new race - they are only 12,000 yrs old. They develop from 6-12,000 yrs ago, and the first real modern Black is 6,000 yrs old. They evolved in tandem with agriculture in Africa, moving from gracile archaics to robust moderns.</p>
<p>In agricultural societies, women don&rsquo;t need men. They can just grow food for themselves. So women get pretty choosy about men. Also these societies tend to evolve polygamy. It&rsquo;s present in both Africa and New Guinea. One guy gets to be chief and he and his buddies get all the women. The other guys more or less get no women. So they evolve intense competition for females. This has driven robustness in Black Africans and high testosterone. Result - high athletic ability, high aggression, very strong bodies and muscles.</p>

			<p>Occam: Well, the highest testosterone is found in polygynous primitive agricultural societies, and it&rsquo;s lower in hunter-gatherers. So we ask what is it about primitive agriculturalists in New Guinea and Africa that evolved high testosterone and robusticity in Africans and high testosterone in Papuans and polygamy in both places. How about competition for women?</p>
<p>Europeans and Asians do not practice polygamy much.</p>
<p>African ironworking appears to have come from Caucasoids in Carthage. However, Africans made tremendous advances, in particular a dizzying array of innovations in this technique from Carthage, very quickly after they got it. It&rsquo;s as if every little region had their own way of smelting iron. I&rsquo;ve reviewed the evidence and I do not believe that Africans innovated ironworking de novo. Sorry.</p>

<p>Did They Or Didn&rsquo;t They Invent It? Iron In Sub-Saharan Africa<br>

			<p>Toynbee and Robert Baker acknowledged that Africans mined iron; whether or not it was indigenously discovered is not too important. It&rsquo;s what is done with the discoveries once they&rsquo;re out. Some peoples were able to incorporate other cultures&rsquo; discoveries and maintain or better them. Japan comes to mind.<br>
  What Baker pointed out in &#8220;Race&#8221;   &mdash;   and he was quick to give Africans credit where credit was due   &mdash;   is that they did not invent anything in the way of simple machines, not even a hinge. </p>

			<p>Robert Lindsay,</p>
<p>I  read  Alpern&rsquo;s  paper  but  it  does  not suggest  as  you  claim  that African iron-working  diffused  from Carthage.  It  says rather  that  there really  is no  clear  answer  as  to  whether  African iron-working  is  of  indigenous origins or  otherwise. But  there  are  hints  here  and  there  that  the  sheer  variety of  African forms of  iron smelting  points  to  indigenous invention.</p>
<p>On your  point  about  Africans and  polygamy. You  contradict  yourself when  you  say that  in agricultural societies  women  become  &#8220;choosy&#8221; about  their  choice  of  mates yet  you  claim  that  polygamy is  the  norm  because  &#8220;one  gets  to  be  chief  and  he  and  his  buddies get  all  the  women&#8221;.  I doubt  your  &#8220;choosy&#8221; women  would  agree  to this.</p>
<p>But  note  that polygamy has also been  much  practiced in  Asia and  Europe.  Think  of  Genghis  Kahn  and  his  thousands of  wives  &mdash;  confirmed  by  his  signature Y DNA  carried  by  a  very  large  percentage of  Central  Asian  males. Chinese emperors  were  also  noted  for  their  thousands  of  wives. And, of  course,  West  Asian  harems have  been  long  noted  by  sociologists  and  historians  of  that  area.</p>
<p>In Europe,  Christianity  served  as  deterrent  to  traditional  European  polygamy  for the  general  populations  but not  the  feudal  classes whose  male  members  indulged  themselves but  protected  their  property by  the  enforcing  of  the  priniciple of  bastardy.</p>
<p>On  African  body  types: Note  that  there  is  no  uniformity  here. The  majority  of  Esat  Africans  tend  to  be  lean and  gracile  &mdash;  hence  their  apteness  for  long-distance running.  In West  Africa  the  average  body-type  is  mesomorphic  tending  to  tallness  and  leaness  in  the  Savanah areas.  So, it&rsquo;s  just  a  mixed  bag  when  it  comes to  African  body  types.</p>
<p>So again, I  must  question  your  testosterone hypothesis  as  explanatory  of  anything  African.</p>

<p>Good point, my friend.  In fact if somebody wanted to take the time and effort to explain why Africans were so backward in every way, he would have a wealth of proof to draw from.  But suffice it to say, in spite of the suspect motives of Mr. Lindsey to try to elevate blacks somehow, blacks lived a stone age existence with a bit of metal here and there for the last 5000 years.</p>
<p>Desperately trying to prove they were involved in planting a seed now and then or melting ore hardly helps to upgrade their image.  Trying to promote blacks as anything other than the world&rsquo;s most primitive people is what communist governments tried to do in flim flamming the public when they attempted to sell them on an idea that was bizarre. </p>

<p>Obama&rsquo;s Political Origins   [Lisa Schiffren]</p>
<p><br>
Until I came across this article by Cliff Kincaid of Accuracy in Media, which I regard as factual  &mdash;  with all that that implies  &mdash;  the questions about Obama&rsquo;s background that should have come naturally never quite rose to the surface of my mind. Barack Obama is the new man, of course. His mixed race is a symbol of that. Just like Tiger Woods  &mdash;  as we have read, endlessly. What&rsquo;s to wonder about? </p>
<p>But maybe it&rsquo;s not so simple. Obama and I are roughly the same age. I grew up in liberal circles in New York City  &mdash;  a place to which people who wished to rebel against their upbringings had gravitated for generations. And yet, all of my mixed race, black/white classmates throughout my youth, some of whom I am still in contact with, were the product of very culturally specific unions. They were always the offspring of a white mother, (in my circles, she was usually Jewish, but elsewhere not necessarily) and usually a highly educated black father. And how had these two come together at a time when it was neither natural nor easy for such relationships to flourish? Always through politics. No, not the young Republicans. Usually the Communist Youth League. Or maybe a different arm of the CPUSA. But, for a white woman to marry a black man in 1958, or 60, there was almost inevitably a connection to explicit Communist politics. (During the Clinton Administration we were all introduced to then U. of Pennsylvania Professor Lani Guinier  &mdash;  also a half black/half Jewish, red diaper baby.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how Barak Obama&rsquo;s parents met. But the Kincaid article referenced above makes a very convincing case that Obama&rsquo;s family, later, (mid 1970s) in Hawaii, had close relations with a known black Communist intellectual. And, according to what Obama wrote in his first autobiography, the man in question  &mdash;  Frank Marshall Davis  &mdash;  appears to have been Barack&rsquo;s own mentor, and even a father figure. Of course, since the Soviet Union itself no longer exists, it&rsquo;s an open question what it means practically to have been politically mentored by an official Communist. Ideologically, the implications are clearer.</p>
<p>Political correctness was invented precisely to prevent the mainstream liberal media from persuing the questions which might arise about how Senator Obama&rsquo;s mother, from Kansas, came to marry an African graduate student. Love? Sure, why not? But what else was going on around them that made it feasible? Before readers level cheap accusations of racism  &mdash;  let&rsquo;s recall that the very question of interracial marriage only became a big issue later in the 1960s. The notion of a large group of mixed race Americans became an issue during and after the Vietnam War. Even the civil-rights movement kept this culturally explosive matter at arm&rsquo;s distance. </p>
<p>It was, of course, an explicit tactic of the Communist party to stir up discontent among American blacks, with an eye toward using them as the leading edge of the revolution. To be sure, there was much to be discontented about, for black Americans, prior to the civil-rights revolution. To their credit, of course, most black Americans didn&rsquo;t buy the commie line  &mdash;  and showed more faith in the possibilities of democratic change than in radical politics, and the results on display in Moscow. </p>
<p>Time for some investigative journalism about the Obama family&rsquo;s background, now that his chances of being president have increased so much.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Having been around a lot of ultra leftists when I worked for the City and County of San Francisco, I recognized a lot of the signs. The city was totally inundated with Ann Dunham types; young adult commie children of communist parents, all well off and equipped with Ivy League degrees. They worked for those Johnson Nixon war on poverty programs during the 1970&rsquo;s. The major criteria for a white person getting a job in those programs was to have good communist credentials and references.&#8221;</p>
<p>I too have lived in San Francisco all my life.  I well remember one day in the mid 1970&rsquo;s.  I went to pick my kids up at the baby sitters after work.  Maureen cared for 4 pre schoolers in her home.  She told me that the Mother of one of the children, Christopher, had rushed in around noon and taken Christopher away saying that there was an emergency.</p>
<p>2 days later 6 FBI agents showed up looking for Christopher&rsquo;s parents.  It seems the parents were some serious underground terrorists with warrants out for bombings and murders.</p>

			<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t the leftist origins of Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;thinking&#8221; as much as the implications his actions may have on the USA core institutions : scientific, military, governmental, and the pseudo-cultural entrenchments in the liberal arts departments of universities. I feel only the latter will grow more bold and whatever influence they have on the next generation will be maximized. Scientific work will carry on unabated and the military will also. The left has no foreign regimes it can tap for funds or help. He is walking into a checkmated situation. He will be watched by the powers that be the moment he walks into the oval office. If Obama or his minions get too out of line he will be whacked. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Lani Guinier  &mdash;  also a half black/half Jewish, red diaper baby.)&#8221;</p>
<p>Lani Guinier was set to be appointed attorney general by Hillary and her coven of feminazis.  Fortunately that was derailed when some of her writings surfaced.</p>
<p>Ms. Guinier wrote that votes shoulded be weighted by race; in other words, that the vote of a black should be worth 5 votes and the vote of a white should be worth only 1 vote.</p>
<p>Even the Clinton&rsquo;s realized that someone with those views could not be approved by the Senate.</p>
<p>Guiner has the exact background as Obama, Mother 2nd generation communist, Father a black activist.  And her communist maternal grandparents had a great deal to do with her anti white communist indoctrination, although she, like Obama later rejected them because they were white.<br>

That is disturbing. But even if she&rsquo;s been set aside, I&rsquo;m sure that there are others out there who hold such views also. It&rsquo;s highly unlikly that she came up with that idea completely on her own, or that she was unique in holding it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t doubt that there are lots of other such wacky notions that are in circulation, even if we don&rsquo;t know about them. Yes, the fertile Left always has plans for us. That is their most galling trait.  Why can&rsquo;t their bleeping Social Engineers just leave us alone?!!!  That&rsquo;s really all we want   &mdash;    just to be ourselves and <i> be left alone!</i></p>

			<p>Blacks were certainly not the world&rsquo;s most primitive people.</p>
<p>That honor goes to the Aborigines, the Negritos, the archaics of India, and to some Siberians (who may have been deculturated), the Khoisan, the Pygmies and the Ainu. Also to many Amerindian tribes. Africans were far ahead of all of these people.</p>
<p>The only people with an agenda here are you guys. &#8220;Trying to prove that Blacks were the most primitive people on Earth.&#8221; Indeed. That is precisely what you are doing.</p>
<p>Working iron is one of the most impressive achievements a civilization can make. So is full array agriculture with surplus. A lot of folks never made it to either. Give credit where it&rsquo;s due.</p>
<p>I think Blacks are great at being *adaptive*. They may not be all that smart, but boy are they adaptive. I don&rsquo;t think they do a lot of innovation either, but given X technology, they can quickly borrow it and figure out how to use it and expand on it. That&rsquo;s what they did with iron and agriculture. </p>

			<p>Occam: The notion that Africans, in general a primitive group lacking in major cultural achievements such as writing systems, machinery, wheel, mathematics, architecture, etc. completely skipped the essential first two phases of metallurgy (copper and bronze) to move straight to the 3rd and most difficult phase (iron) is completely absurd. It&rsquo;s clearly diffusion.</p>
<p>In Angola, we have agricultural people who are robust and have high testosterone next to gracile, child-like hunter-gatherers. We have the same thing all over Africa. All over the world, even within ethnicities, agricultural males have higher testosterone than hunter-gatherers. This cries out for explanation, for which you offer none.</p>
<p>The transition from child-like, gracile, low testosterone hunter-gatherers to modern robust Blacks with high testosterone was precisely coincidental with the rise of agriculture in Africa. This also cries out for explanation.</p>
<p>*Primitive* agriculturalists tend to have polygamy and high testosterone. Why? You offer no explanation.</p>
<p>In China and Europe, only the royalty practiced polygamy. A tiny percentage of the population. On the city or village level, most men had exactly one wife, and there was not much competition for females. In the ME, polygamy seems to be associated with Islam and at any rate is not real common. Most men marry and have children. </p>
<p>Gracile types in East Africa are only about 3,500 years old. They occur after the high selection for testosterone had already occurred in West Africa. Perhaps selection pressure for robusticity went off, but the high testosterone stayed.</p>
<p>High testosterone and robusticity probably evolved in Central and West Africa in tandem with intense competition for choosy women. After polygamy was instituted, choosiness of females was irrelevant as they were all picked off. If selection occurred for robust, aggressive and high testosterone males, who then produced most of the kids, the result would be robust, high testosterone male offspring. It&rsquo;s just a theory, but you don&rsquo;t have a better one.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll grant you that M. Lindsay  &mdash;  but it seems those civilizations didn&rsquo;t evolve much past that did they?</p>
<p>How about the impressive achievements of Whites?  After all, Whites put a man on the moon (and that being just one of our many accomplishments  &mdash;  no small feat, that, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?).</p>
<p>Could it possibly be&hellip;.our higher IQs? Our larger brains?</p>
<p>We may have been painting ourselves blue in the cold nether regions of Europe while Africans were practicing metallurgy but it&rsquo;s all in how one advances and finishes. </p>
<p>Look at how far we&rsquo;ve come! Modern technology, modern science and medicine including antibiotics, communication systems, space exploration and travel, advanced financial and economic systems (that work when the government doesn&rsquo;t interfere)  &mdash;  please feel free to add whatever else has been born from White civilizations (and gifted to the rest of the world), as it&rsquo;s too long for me to list at the present time.</p>
<p>Yes!  Let&rsquo;s give credit where credit is due, to Whites!  &mdash;  since it seems no one else is these days&hellip;</p>

			<p>It isn&rsquo;t that Obama is all that great, it&rsquo;s just that he looks really good when compared to essentially every black his age and younger.  There used to be lots of bright, polite, well-spoken blacks in the 1950s and even the 60s, but since then they are raised to be hostile, bitter, angry, poorly-dressed, resentful, and paraniod to the extent that I believe that most of them could be diagnosed as mentally ill.   So Obama looks especially strong compared to this backdrop of dysfunction.</p>
