				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Wadhams, Time, October 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Jerome Corsi has jousted lucratively with Barack Obama, tackling the presidential candidate&rsquo;s reputation with a bestselling if factually challenged book that accuses the Senator of, among other things, ties to militant Islam. But he may have gone a little too far into enemy territory when he flew into Kenya, birthplace of Obama&rsquo;s father. Kenyan immigration officials deported Corsi, they said, over problems with his visa. They made their move before Corsi was scheduled to give a press conference at which he promised to expose secret ties between Obama and Kenyan leaders as well as a mysterious plot that would be launched should the Democratic nominee win the U.S. election.</p>
<p>Corsi, author of The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality, was in Kenya writing dispatches for World Net Daily at the invitation of Christian missionaries who fear the rise of Islam in Kenya. According to World Net Daily, he wanted to answer &#8220;lingering questions&#8221; about Obama&rsquo;s ties to Prime Minister Raila Odinga.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Apart from debuting his book in Kenya (so far it is unavailable at bookstores here) and providing details about what he says are Obama&rsquo;s ties to Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, Corsi had said that his press conference would &#8220;expose details of deep secret ties between the U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and a section of Kenya government leaders, their connection to certain sectoral groups in Kenya and subsequent plot to be executed in Kenya should Senator Obama win the American presidency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corsi claims that Obama has strong ties to Odinga, whom the author says fomented Kenya&rsquo;s post-election violence last January in a bid to secure the presidency after the results declared incumbent President Mwai Kibaki the winner. In fact, independent observers disputed Kibaki&rsquo;s victory and a commission looking into the vote recently determined that Kenya would never know if Odinga or Kibaki truly won. In his writings Corsi has sought to link the Luos &mdash; the tribe of Odinga as well as Obama&rsquo;s ancestors &mdash; with Muslims and to pit both of them against Kikuyus, the tribe of Kibaki.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Corsi also claims that Obama was in close contact with Odinga, advising the Kenyan politician on strategy after the results were announced. Lone says he was there the one time that Obama called Odinga, and he says it wasn&rsquo;t to talk campaign strategy but rather, according to Lone, to demand that the violence end and that Odinga and his rival, President Kibaki, come to a peaceful solution to the crisis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Corsi had also planned to deliver a $1,000 check to Obama&rsquo;s half-brother George, who lives in a slum in Nairobi. One Republican ad has accused Obama of abandoning his brother, who was recently reported in Italian Vanity Fair to be living on a dollar a month. But George Obama has repeatedly denied that he said any such thing or that he feels abandoned by Obama. George Obama is currently in school studying to be an auto mechanic and says he has plenty to eat.</p>

			<p>The rise of a Black nobody to the presidency of the U.S. is bizarre enough to make any theory plausible.  How do you apply Occam&rsquo;s Razor to the irrational?  My favorite conspiracy is that the Dark Forces of Racism have set him upon a pedestal, planning to knock him off and take advantage of the resulting chaos to clean out all the garbage in this country.  Hope and Change, allright.  </p>

			<p>Attention Christian missionaries: without a sizeable number of white people on the ground in these sub-saharan nations, your efforts are a waste of time.  Islam will win because it is&hellip;get ready for this&hellip;AGGRESSIVE.  They are going to win the hearts and minds of these populations because in the end the image of a strong, muscular God will always be more appealing to primitive peoples than the image of some guy hanging on a cross wailing for peace and love.  Sorry if you find this offensive.  But without large white communities to lead by example, your simple minded missionary work is doomed.  And good luck when the pagan Chinese arrive.</p>

			<p>Whether Corsi is able to eventually deliver a bomb about Obama isn&rsquo;t going to matter one bit in the final election results, because I just clicked over from the town hall debate between Obama and John McCain, and McCain is bombing out big time.  I&rsquo;ve never seen a worse performance by any presidential candidate ever.  His first debate was excellent.  This one is absolutely horrible.</p>
<p>To add to his woes, he&rsquo;s supporting the bailout package which is opposed by the vast majority of this country, and he&rsquo;s clumsily trying to explain that the Democrats were responsible for the problem to begin with&hellip;which is correct and what he should be doing&hellip;&hellip;.. but he&rsquo;s coming across weak and ineffectual, looking much older than his 72 years.  If he does better as the debate goes on, I won&rsquo;t know it, because his ineptness was just too painful to watch, and I doubt he can salvage anything.  </p>
<p>What a shame such an excellent candidate like Sarah Palin has to be burdened with someone who is such an anchor around her neck.</p>
<p>Unless something drastic occurs, this election is over, and we have an evil pro-black activist getting ready to screw this country up even more than Clinton or Carter ever could.</p>
<p>Time to look toward the wilderness of Idaho&hellip;&hellip;.or, maybe, Alaska, hoping the Obamanation causes even greater economic strife which will likely result in breakup.   </p>

			<p>I had a really bad nightmare last night. I dreamed that after Obama was elected there was a phony assassination plot against him. Spurred on by our Marxist media, habeas corpus is suspended and all firearms are collected by the government. Because some police and military units refuse to cooperate, United Nations troops are called in to quell the &#8216;disturbances&rsquo;. Dissenters are arrested, Congress is suspended, and the government takes control of the media. However, Joe Sixpack doesn&rsquo;t give a damn because his fridge is filled with beer, there are twelve N.F.L. games on this weekend, and he found some really good porn sites on the net.</p>

&#8220;Corsi also claims that Obama was in close contact with Odinga, advising the Kenyan politician&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
If Obama wins next month, we&rsquo;re ALL going to be in close contact with Odinga&hellip; and with other Kenyan politicians&hellip; and with Kenya generally. Myself, I feel we in the West have too much contact with Africa already   &mdash;   and I sure don&rsquo;t want any MORE. </p>
<p>The world has lots of &#8220;failed states.&#8221; But only ONE failed continent. And all other continents who don&rsquo;t want to end up failing themselves should endeavor to AVOID Africa. Nothing good ever comes from there. Africa is merely a black hole (no pun) into which the money and the efforts of non-Africans DISAPPEAR. The only smart thing to do is to steer clear of the entire region as much as possible&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;Which will, of course, NOT be possible with a half-African president. A Pres. Obama will regard Africa&rsquo;s problems as America&rsquo;s responsibility   &mdash;   which is sure to get us entangled in all manner of African NONSENSE. </p>
<p>Just say NObama!<br>

			<p>Mitch I don&rsquo;t what you were looking at but McCain did better than Obama.  Obama had to struggle on some of the answers to string a sentence together.  The media of course will predictably say that Obama was the winner no matter how bad he did.  Being a Democrat I can say with some confidence that Obama is not going to get elected.  The American people aren&rsquo;t stupid enough to put a virtual unknown with a fuzzy past and controversial associates into the White House.  I never realized till this election just how biased the media is.  You&rsquo;ve got polls showing Obama ahead by as much as 9 points.  They&rsquo;re doing this to shape your public opinion on the election but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s working.  I can look and listen to this guy and I can tell there&rsquo;s nothing to him.  It&rsquo;s nothing but media hype.</p>

			<p>First and foremost, it is highly unlikely that Obama made any international calls. There is absolutely no need for him to stick his neck out. I have been monitoring the press in both Indonesia and Kenya, I have a slight advantage there insofar as that I have some small knowledge of Swahili, both countries - a man for all seasons - consider him one of their own, both believe that come the day he will reciprocate their support, both too are dictatorships and anyone who does not agree with them will be silenced one way or the other. I am willing to take bets that what Corsi discovered is simply that Obama put pressure on the government to include Odinga in the administration and that he made certain promises that were he to be president, the aid tap would be turned on all the way. I can assure you that anything connected with Obama both in Kenya and Indonesia is now a state secret, a potential bargaining chip, and no one will ever find the truth unless he fails to ante up.</p>

<p>lucylou, very possibly: never.  Even as they themselves are consumed by the rising tide of virulent, anti-white racists, those drooling fools will be more likely to blame their (& our) sorry fate on evil whites who for so long oppressed all others, provoking their wrath&hellip;</p>
<p>Then again, perhaps there will be enough who see what&rsquo;s going on, and fight for their survival.  Some already do.  </p>

<p>With all due respect, guy, it is the American people who are backing this Obama as vigorously as they did when they put Carter and Clinton in the White House, both of whom were so far left their policies are still weakening the country today. </p>
<p>It is the American people who are so naive and gullible they recite politically correct dogma in nearly all the universities, the media, Hollywood, and even corporate America has bought into it.</p>
<p>True there are a solid group amounting to millions who are of a conservative bent, but there is a greater number who can be propagandized any way a propagandist wants to turn them.  They comprise the left and many of the Independents, and some of the &#8220;altruistic&#8221; right-leaning whites.</p>
<p>If the majority of American people really earned the right to be thought of as knowing intuitively where the truth lies, they would be up in arms fighting charges of white racism, pointing out the many instances of black racism.  And they would be posting on this board right here just as outraged as we are, but they aren&rsquo;t aware enough to understand that blacks and other non-whites are taking their country from them.  </p>
<p>Clinton, Carter or Obama types, could never be elected by whites if they were aware enough to understand the truth.  Many prefer to go to a certain length in opposition, but back off, because of misguided altruism and a childish, naive idea they must be overly fair with enemies who want to destroy them. </p>
<p>Rush told us today not to lose heart, because of the abysmal performance by McCain last night.  He said we would have to work to drag him across the finish line, then work on nullifying his cabinet appointments after that.  Obviously, the entire conservative base has been complaining just as I did above, so I&rsquo;m not alone in my opinion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I think there&rsquo;s not enough time to win the election, because the polls showing Obama five points ahead are wrong almost every election, it&rsquo;s just that I doin&rsquo;t think McCain has the ability to get an effective message across and if there&rsquo;s an election to lose he&rsquo;ll certainly do just that.</p>
<p>His greatest boost was in bringing Sarah Palin in to boost his numbers with a powerful conservative base, but he&rsquo;s too dense to understand that such a move was a winner for him if he just stayed on that course.  Instead he continues to pander to a handful of people who are part of the moderate Democrats.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s hoping you&rsquo;re right and I&rsquo;m wrong, because if I&rsquo;m right this country will be in black hands, with radical rabid leftist radicals telling them what to do.</p>

<p>She is part of conservative Americans who embrace traditional American values, God, mom, and apple pie, and I can tell you for certain, in no way would she have set heavily armed troops against women and children in Waco, nor would she have set loose tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters and thousands of armed troops against a family of five people in Ruby Ridge, Idaho.  </p>
<p>&#8220;She is shilling for a presidential candidate who is hell-bent on reducing Native Born White Americans to a racial minority.&#8221;</p>
<p>She has no choice but to go along with what McCain&rsquo;s wrong-headed policies are if she wants to get established into national politics that will offer a step to the presidency.  She has a solid grounding in what most of us believe, so I fully expect her to pursue her own policies and ideas as soon as she&rsquo;s in a position to do so.  </p>
<p>Sarah Palin IS the average white conservative American in this country, and her views are only a heartbeat away from ours right now, but they can be brought in line as soon as we get her in position for the presidency.</p>
<p>Once she shakes that little white-headed twerp, she&rsquo;ll be able to do as she pleases.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like him any better than you do, but, with the economy going into the tank, the little jerk isn&rsquo;t going to be in a position to attack anybody, so we&rsquo;re protected against his war-mongering by financial conditions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re stuck with him, because we can&rsquo;t give up the country and let this pro-black Marxist in and his drooling-at-the mouth rabid leftist advisers.</p>
<p>And the only person we&rsquo;ve ever had close to the person we want is Ronald Reagan and now Sarah Palin.</p>

			<p>Xenophon, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading your other posts; However, on the one you just posted you are dead wrong.  If you type in the key words &#8220;Al-Jazeera warns about Christian conversions&#8221; or something simular on Youtube, you will get to see a video of Al-Jazeera (translated) talking mainly about Muslims turning to Christ in droves on the dark continent.  You will also get other videos that are about the same thing.  These folks are getting visions, healed, and their testimonies are powerful&hellip;.</p>

			<p>The Incredible Shrinking White Man, I loved your post.  But I must take issue with you on your statement that nothing good ever comes out of there:  I saw White rule/Colonialization as one of a few good things that ever happened to Africa, as well as Christian worship.  But other than that, Africa is indeed a black hole where behavior and low I.Q. dictates (pun intended) their governments/lifestyles&hellip;.</p>

<p>The fact is that Obama did win the debate. McCain looked angry, cynical and impateient. He and his wife left immediately after the debate while the Obama&rsquo;s stayed around, shook hands and posed for pictures with audience members.</p>
<p>This is the sort of image that the public likes to see. Whether we like it or not, as long as the economy keeps tanking and the McCain campaign fails to divert attention from the economy, Obama is going to win.</p>
<p>This is sad, but true.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a little more information about Obama&rsquo;s commie friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Below is the book William Ayers wrote <br>
A Kind and Just Parent: The Children of Juvenile Court </p>
<p>By William Ayers Published by Beacon Press, 1998 224 pages ISBN 0807044032, 9780807044032 </p>
<p>Page 81 We live in Hyde Park-Kenwood south of the Loop on the lake. In a tree across the street I see two green parrots, mutant urban birds descended from escaped &hellip; </p>
<p>Page 82 Our neighbors include Muhammad Ali, former mayor Eugene Sawyer, poets Gwendolyn Brooks and Elizabeth Alexander, and writer Barack Obama. </p>
<p>Minister Louis Farrakhan lives a block from our home and adds, we think, a unique dimension to the idea of &#8220;safe neighborhood watch&#8221;; the Fruit of Islam, his security force, has an eye on things twenty-four-hours a day. I pass Farrakhan&rsquo;s mansion, offer a cheery wave to the Fruit, get a formal nod in response, and turn north two blocks across 47th Street, into the lap of urban blight. </p>

<p>Ayers had to know Obama at a very close level to mention him in his book along with Muhammad Ali and Louis Farrakhan. </p>
<p>The book came out in 1998. It takes about 2-3 years to write and publish a book, so this friendship can be placed going back to at least 1995. </p>
<p>The evidence comes straight from William Ayers. </p>

			<p>I like Sarah Palin and believe she is a breath of fresh air for the political system.  However, Jupiter makes a great point.  She may very well be McCain&rsquo;s sidekick and may not stand for the American people after all.  Still McCain/Palin are the best of two evils if I may say so</p>

			<p>Rush Limbaugh played a recent clip of James Carville saying, in essence, Obama better win or there would be black riots.  He was warning everyone to vote for Obama or suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Nothing illustrates how out-of-touch  the Washington elites are than this, because they believe nobody would want to see black riots and have great fear of them.  The blacks think the same way and often threaten riots also.</p>
<p>I wonder if they could EVER grasp the fact that there are absolutely MILLIONS of white Americans who would welcome black riots in order to have an opportunity to drive them out once and for all.</p>
<p>Because the elitists fear such an event, they judge everybody by their own wimpish selves and conclude everyone is the same way.</p>

<p>Your quote on Ayers commenting on the peacefulness of his, Obama&rsquo;s, Muhammad Ali, Minister Louis Farrakhan Hyde Park/Kenwood Chicago neighborhood is a comment about the neighborhood I was born and raised in.</p>
<p>I great up 2 blocks from where the Obama&rsquo;s live now, and the Nation of Islam has always been there. Ayers is correct that the bow tie Fruit of Islam looking for assassins - help to keep down regular neighborhood crime.</p>
<p>The point people should understand about Hyde Park/Kenwood Chicago &#8220;radicals&#8221; like the ones mention is that they talk, talk, talk radical, violent revolutionary &#8220;Change&#8221; - but, like the muc hated 5th Avenue limo liberals depicted with brutal honesty in Thomas Wolfe&rsquo;s Radical Chic, the Hyde Park radicals are all talk, they like living in a safe, upper middle class neighborhood with grand houses  - these houses need skilled (white) workers to maintain the roofs, electricity etc and the criminals who would/do try to break into these houses to steal from the rich - yes the Obamas, Ayers, Nation of Islam leaders are rich radicals who incite the poor non Whites to go for revolution in someone else&rsquo;s neighborhood, not ours.</p>
<p>Hyde Park/Kenwood Chicago - a place where Blacks and Whites and everyone else gets together to work to keep out the poor.<br>

<p>There HAVE been black riots in the past, plenty of them    &mdash;   one after another after another, in city after city.  Were they EVER &#8220;driven out&#8221;&hellip; even out of just ONE city?  Was anything EVER done about them, aside from giving them more funds and sympathy and concessions?</p>
<p>Dream on!<br>

<p>Reference here obviously is to more than a response to just black riots, but just so much can be written here. More graphic posts will be rejected.  My first one already has been.</p>
<p>Let me just say that the type of riots being threatened now are much more than that, and the threat of black riots is national, not just local as those you refer to.  </p>
<p>You write as if a vigorous white defense scares you.  If you want a definitive elaboration, I&rsquo;d be glad to give you one if you would like to contact me.</p>
