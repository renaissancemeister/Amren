<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1016/p09s01-coop.html">Why Some Blacks Still Might Not Vote for Obama</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A New York Times poll taken this past July showed that 6 percent of black respondents say that they wouldn&rsquo;t vote for a black candidate (presumably Obama). Just 5 percent of white respondents said the same.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s behind this black resistance to Obama?</p>
<p>More than a few blacks grumble that Obama will be blamed for the financial mess, which may only get worse on his watch. {snip}</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the age-old rap that blacks who don&rsquo;t support other blacks for political office or anything else are filled with self-loathing and color phobia &mdash; in reverse. {snip}</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also the persistent fear that if Obama wins, he will be in perpetual danger of being assassinated.</p>
<p>But none of this totally explains the trepidation and reluctance of some blacks to back Obama.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the point that&rsquo;s often missed: Blacks aren&rsquo;t and never have been of one mind on anything, nor should they be. Blacks are as varied and diverse in their social and political views as any other demographic, and that includes embracing conservative social and religious positions.</p>
<p>This was plainly evident in the presidential battle in Ohio and Florida in 2004. Bush racked up double digit vote percentages among black voters. He did it by shrewdly appealing to the hard opposition of many blacks to abortion, gay marriage, and their support of school vouchers.</p>
<p>Polls have also shown that a significant number of blacks oppose welfare, back the death penalty, and support black anti-affirmative crusader Ward Connerly&rsquo;s state initiatives banning affirmative action programs in public hiring. {snip}</p>
<p>But while conservatives are still a very distinct minority of black voters, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that all blacks will instinctively back a black candidate. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blacks have even backed white Democratic incumbents against black challengers in Democratic primaries. The issue for them was the real and perceived notion that the incumbent had done and would continue to do a better job in improving education, getting increased funding for job programs, and neighborhood services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the few black who won&rsquo;t support Obama are proof that blacks, like anyone else, make political choices based on many factors &mdash; and color isn&rsquo;t always one of them.<br>

			<p>Well as we get closer to the date, more and more unsavory facts come to light. Its the economy, the trillion dollar bailout (of which no poor black person will ever see a dime of anyway) and the policies of Obama that will make him lose. No vouchers for education. Not for blacks or anyone else under O&rsquo;s plan. More and more, blacks are seeing just how corrupt this slick talking lawyer and his backers really are and how hurtful those policies are going to be for EVERYONE. Not to mention the spittle flecked insanity of the America hating Kos Kritters that will ride along with his baggage.</p>
<p>They can alway say one thing to their friends and the polsters  and still vote Palin in the privacy of the booth. Or just vote against the Chicago crime machine and senator Obama&rsquo;s white half&hellip; and still feel they&rsquo;ve done a good job of stickin&rsquo; it to the man.</p>

<p>On this score, it looks like the &#8220;talented tenth&#8221; should be renamed the superior six percent</p>
<p>It is equally laughable, how whites who will not vote for Comrade BO are suspect of being closet &#8220;racists,&#8221; when only 5% of them are going to to so based on race. That is, if the ever so pro-white New York Times and its poll are to be believed? </p>
<p>Time will tell just how many whites will politically split on this fool, but  he has yet to lose and already we are being threatened that if a sizeable majority of whites (say 57% to 62%) vote against him and he does, there will at best be a global repudiation of us and at worst internal violence because of our &#8220;intolerance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just imagine what might be the horrors of our &#8220;racist&#8221; sins, if we like blacks, were going to vote against him by 94% to 6% based only on his race?</p>
<p>Might not the whole earth be split in two?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>What a load.  The purpose of this article is probably to make sure that every single black Obama voter makes it to the polls to off set the few McCain black votes.</p>
<p>I bet even Condi Rice will vote for Obama as a way of showing her gratitude to the Bush family for promoting and helping her career for the last 30 years.</p>

			<p>Such a shame. Earl had an entire article to at least mention all the reasons why some black voters will not support a black candidate&hellip;.like Obama? </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s Mom is totally white. His pappy is from Kenya. He has nothing in common with the &#8220;decendents of slaves&#8221; in the USA. Shucks, Obama never lived in any of the lower-48 states that comprise the mainland of this country until after he graduated from high school! </p>
<p>How about the good reason why some blacks will not vote for Obama&hellip;.he is a &#8220;half-rican&#8221;&hellip;.not an African&hellip;..and only barely an American. He is half Kenyan, not half black American.</p>

<p>I find this laughable. Here 90 to 95% of blacks are polling for Obama and this writer is wondering why it&rsquo;s not 99 to 100%? The fact is that blacks DO vote as a more or less monolithic bloc. Nothing is ever 100%.</p>
<p>Surely there are some commendable blacks who won&rsquo;t vote by race but they are a small minority. I find that blacks generally have a narrower range of viewpoints and interests than whites do. Let&rsquo;s just say that whites show a greater <i> diversity</i> of opinions.</p>

			<p>Obama is polling at over 90% among blacks. That is as close to monolithic as possible. There might be a few blacks out there who don&rsquo;t stick with their race, but the vast majority do. This election has shown just how racist blacks really are. Obama has already won over massive amounts of white voters. It&rsquo;s McCain and Hillary that couldn&rsquo;t get hardly any black votes. This election has proven that Whites are willing to support a black candidate against against a white one, but blacks wont support a white candidate against a black one. I can&rsquo;t believe that so many white people are too stupid to see this for what it is. Blacks are mounting a concerted effort to get one of their own in the White House. But never fear, there is a silver lining to all of this. An Obama/Reid/Pelosi Junta coupled with an economic collapse = revolution. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m almost speechless. This buffoon claims that blacks have intellectual and political diversity because ONLY 94% of them are voting for Obama?</p>
<p>As for his anecdote about blacks pulling the lever for white candidates over their own in the Democratic primaries: I&rsquo;d bet that mostly happens because they don&rsquo;t know the race of all the candidates so (like most whites)they end up voting for the incumbents due to their name recognition.    </p>

			<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s just say that whites show a greater diversity of opinions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Diversity&rsquo; only means skin color. Unless they need to change &#8216;attitudes&rsquo;, then diversity means that. Diversity means whatever they say it does, and it&rsquo;s always a noble endeavor. And it always, always stands for something against the interests of whites, wherever they may be. <br>

			<p>This idea that Blacks would not vote for Obama out of morbid fear of his certain assassination(presumably at the hands of wicked white racists)is as laughably stupid as it is obviously false! These are the same people who will gun each other down if one looks at the other wrong, sell their own offspring for drug money, steal from their grandmothers, burn down their own neighborhoods, etc. Yeah, all these Blacks are soooooo concerned for the safety of this one mixed-race political candidate, that they couldn&rsquo;t possibly vote for him lest his precious life be put in danger! This is silliest thing to come out of this whole ridiculous political farse yet! And only other Blacks or clueless, deracinated whites would believe it&hellip; </p>

			<p>The vast majority of blacks in this country favor blacks the world over above everything else&hellip;.including their countrymen.<br>
They are very closely aligned with Jeremiah Wright and very far removed from anything white, be it a person, an institution, a culture, a tradition, or what-have-you.  And that will never change.</p>
<p>As Rush Limbaugh said the other day:  Every race on earth succeeds in this country even if they&rsquo;re off the boat only a few years with a language barrier, but blacks still fail and fail miserably.</p>
<p>Rush can&rsquo;t say that the reason for black failure is lack of ability and intelligence and instead must cloak the reason for their ineptitude in something else, like leaders who rile them up so they hate instead of trying to compete, but he knows as most everybody does that blacks have no business in an advanced society trying to compete with other races.</p>
<p>Blaming white and systemic racism allows them to have a scapegoat for their lack of success.  Since the alternative is to admit the truth, they rabidly recite perceived injustices against them that amounts to nothing more than nonsense.</p>
<p>And even if they get a black in as pres, there will likely be many substandard appointments to positions and much more AA in government and the private sector, but nothing will change regarding black intelligence and ability.  They&rsquo;ll still fail tests; they&rsquo;ll still screw up in high level positions; they&rsquo;ll still evidence ineptitude in lower level jobs they been awarded via AA; but most of all their crime and violence rates will still be higher than any other race in America.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an example of inferior black reasoning that they want a black in as pres, because they stupidly believe he, a rare exception who is half white, will be representative of blacks and change their image as people who are on an intellectual par with all the other races of the earth.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t happen, except to a few white leftist fools, of course.  If war doesn&rsquo;t erupt while Obama is in office, when he leaves blacks will gravitate to their own level just the same as water does.</p>
<p>What blacks need is their own country, so comparisons can&rsquo;t be easily made between them and everybody else.   </p>

			<p>You see how they encourage blacks to vote for a black. But if it was the other way around. Do you think they would do a story on why whites still won&rsquo;t vote McCain. No they would do a story on why whites still won&rsquo;t vote for a black. </p>
<p>The racism against whites this whole election is out of hand. Every thing for McCain talk about how bad segregation was, to Obama&rsquo;s church. To the media rageing against whites who won&rsquo;t vote for their man. Whites need to unite, the media is in the hands on non-white radicals who spread their lies. The best thing to come from this election was for whites to see how controlled the media really is. </p>

			<p>I probably have more black, conservative friends than the average white liberal has black friends, PERIOD!  I know them through my gun club &amp; various anti-illegal alien groups.  They are all good people, most ex-military.</p>
<p>HOWEVER   &mdash;   I do not know of a SINGLE ONE of them who is going to vote for McCain!  Some use convoluted logic along the lines that both McCain and Obama are for amnesty &amp; gun control, so the Republicans in Congress will be more likely to oppose Obama&rsquo;s schemes than McCain.  (Not a completely crazy analysis, by the way.) Most simply keep their mouths shut during political discussions.</p>
<p>Just shows that blood is thicker than water.  If I lived in a majority black country, and had the chance to elect a white president, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be too picky about his politics, either.</p>
