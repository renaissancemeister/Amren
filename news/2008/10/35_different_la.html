<h1><a href="https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/3753754.35_different_languages_are_spoken_in_Dorset_schools/">35 Different Languages Are Spoken in Dorset Schools</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jane Reader, Bournemouth (UK) Echo, October 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>AN INFLUX of migrants means up to 35 different languages are spoken in individual Bournemouth primary schools.</p>
<p>One in 10 pupils at Malmesbury Park Primary School cannot speak English and a further 15 per cent have needed extra help to learn the language in the past.</p>
<p>The picture is the same at St Michael&rsquo;s Primary in the town centre, the area most affected by the culture change.</p>
<p>And some Boscombe schools are seeing dramatic rises in the number of pupils categorised as EAL (English as an Additional Language).</p>
<p>Such statistics are common in inner-city areas of the UK, where ethnic minorities routinely outnumber white British pupils.</p>
<p>But the figures are likely to surprise many people who may not have previously thought it applied to Dorset David Blakely, head teacher of Malmesbury Park in Lowther Road, said the number of languages spoken in the school had risen gradually over the last 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a wide variety from Polish and Korean to Arabian and different forms of Spanish,&#8221; he told the Daily Echo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&rsquo;t even heard of some of the languages until the children arrive here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said around 60 of the school&rsquo;s 635 pupils need intensive support because they cannot speak English and said two teaching assistants have been employed to help them. An extra teacher also comes in two days a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;I firmly believe it does not have a bad effect on the rest of the pupils in the school,&#8221; added Mr Blakely.</p>
<p>&#8220;The school has done relatively well in recent tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;The children here are learning about the differences between different cultures and learning to get on together, which is a good thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he continued: &#8220;They are learning life skills that it would be hard to teach without that ethnic mix.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Until an English only proposition funded and organized by entrepeneur Ron Unz, 81 different languages were spoken in Los Angeles schools.</p>
<p>Thank God for Ron Unz!!!!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how fast immigrant children and their parents learn English when they have to.</p>

			<p>And the British looney left are revelling in the flames of the Gotterdammerung they&rsquo;ve brought down on Western civilization, or imagining a Jesus-like martyrdom of the white race will purify the &#8216;sins&rsquo; of colonialism and black slavery.</p>
<p>The cycle of misery they&rsquo;ve started will cruelly punish our innocent descendants, who will be born into the slavery of white man&rsquo;s burden.</p>

			<p>England, like other white countires, are in the grips of a diabolical phenomenon, and as good white Europeans, we must ask God in prayer, to intervene.</p>

			<p>Someone once a posted a Russian literary giant to the effect that &#8220;A man with a fond memory cannot be beaten.&#8221;  Sounds like these  British kids don`t even have that. I wonder if the White British kids don`t still look through WWII picture books like I did growing up and ask, &#8220;What happened?&#8221; </p>

			<p>Can you imagine how frusterating that would be.. to be stuck with people who speak 35 different languages. Talk about inefficient. </p>

			<p>This is particularly worrying when you consider that Bournemouth (really in Hampshire, but transferred to Dorset by philistine Tories in the 70s for allegedly administrative reasons) is a seaside resort far from the main urban centres of England (London, Birmingham, the North-West, the West Riding), and surrounded by very rural areas. The invaders are making inroads everywhere now, in accordance with the culturally Marxist/globalist plan to destroy England.</p>

			<p>   35 different languages? How does anyone learn anything in a mess like this? Sounds like a new labor mess to me? And Tony Blair wants to be European Union president. I guess he hasn&rsquo;t destroyed enough of his own country. And now, he wants to destroy even more of the world. All libs are enemies of the people. </p>

			<p>I had one new yorker bragging to me that unlike here in texas, his area of new york had people who spoke 170 different languages!! He was just beside himself with pride and bashed texas for being too provencial(even though spanish is our 2nd language and gaining.) Yes, he thought his &#8220;tower of babel&#8221; was wonderful. What an idiot!!!!</p>

			<p>We do have a choice however. Our English White Christian schoolchildren could be taught a whole bunch of useless dialects or the incomers, volunteers every one, be taught the English language at an induction class prior to entering mainstream schooling. One advantage of implementing the latter course is that the foreign children can then go home and teach their parents what they have learned on a daily basis and so save our country a fortune in providing free adult education courses to aliens. Ah! The joys of celebrating ethnic multi-culturism.  </p>

			<p>This sounds like &#8220;the tower of Babel&hellip;.all those languages, and the only smarts among them, are the English speaking (or the language of said country) students!!! The rest are there to bankrupt every single country, including the USA  let there be no mistake about that!!</p>

<p>Did God intervene to save the Russian Christians from the Bolsheviks?  Did He intervene to save His &#8220;chosen people&#8221; in WW2?  </p>
<p>We save ourselves or nobody does it for us.</p>
