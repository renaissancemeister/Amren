<h1>The Islamist Elephant in the Room No Politicians Will Acknowledge</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Kay, National Post (Toronto), October 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I had the privilege of spending a few hours today, October 2,  amongst the bravest people in Canada.</p>
<p>One, Marc Lebuis, is a name you won&rsquo;t recognize, because up to now he&rsquo;s kept a low profile as the one-man show running www.pointdebasculecanada.ca. This is an anti-Islamist site that brings francophone Quebecers the news and frank opinions on the relentless push of the soft jihadists in our midst to Islamicize society, opinions that the mainstream media are too politically correct to publish. Marc and some close associates organized today&rsquo;s press conference on the subject, &#8220;Political Islam &mdash; A Threat to Our Freedoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three other brave people appearing with him should be household names, but their courage and eloquence is, shamefully, only known and saluted by a relative handful of grateful Canadians: Salim Mansur, Tarek Fatah and Raheel Raza, three Canadian Muslims facing death threats by other Canadian Muslims for exposing the dangers of Islamism, a totalitarian ideology that wears the mask of religion.</p>
<p>The room at the Omni hotel in Montreal was filled to capacity, reverberating with frequent applause to statements like these from Salim Mansur: &#8220;Islam is my private life, my conscience .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [but] my faith does not take precedence over my duties .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to Canada and its constitution, which I embrace freely;&#8221; &#8220;I am first and most importantly a Canadian;&#8221; &#8220;only in a free society will you find Islam as a faith and not a political religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Appreciation was shown as well for the statements of  Tarek Fatah, who spoke about the threat to freedom of speech posed by Islamists who constantly seek to chill any perceived criticism of any Muslim. In explaining the danger Islamism poses to society, Fatah said that &#8220;Islam is to Islamism as uranium is to weapons of mass destruction.&#8221; Having lived 30 years in Pakistan and 10 in Saudi Arabia, Fatah knows intimately what constitutes &#8220;soft jihad&#8221; when he sees it. He expressed his sorrow, as a lifetime social democrat that after 17 years of engaged support for the NDP, he could no longer be affiliated with that party. He saw the doors opening to Islamists under Alexa McDonough and now, under Layton, he has seen them &#8220;flood&#8221; into the party.</p>
<p>It soon became apparent that the particular political focus of all three of the speakers is the NDP, which has shamelessly courted and integrated into its inner circles Islamist Muslims with views that are antithetical and even dangerous to the continued health of Canadian values. Fatah has watched in frustration as Islamists in the NDP pursue a relentless campaign to instill a sense of victimhood in Muslim youth. Yesterday an NDP candidate in Toronto Centre &mdash; an immigration lawyer, Farouk El-Khaki &mdash; accused the judiciary of being anti-Islam. He was not chastised by Jack Layton, and even more worrying, he was not held to account by any other party candidate. It is clear that no party leader wants Islamism raised as an election issue.</p>
<p>Jack Layton, Mansur said &#8220;has gone to bed with Islamists.&#8221; He is running candidates in Ontario and Quebec who are closely identified with the push for Sharia law, which, all the panelists made clear is the litmus test for dividing real moderate Muslims from Islamists. Fatah also expressed his contempt for the Ontario Human Rights Commission which, he asserted is &#8220;infiltrated by Islamists&#8221;: There are commissioners in the OHCR closely linked to the Canadian Islamic Congress and the Canada-Arab federation, both of which, according to Fatah, have &#8220;contempt for Canadian values.&#8221; Anyone, he says, &#8220;who brings religion into politics should be suspect&#8221; because they &#8220;are a threat to western civilization.&#8221; The NDP&rsquo;s failure to interrogate their Muslim supporters for fear of revealing their Islamism is the &#8220;racism of lower expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raheel Raza introduced herself as &#8220;the proud recipient of a fatwa&#8221; for having the gall to try to lead prayers. She shared her joy in having the freedom in Canada to be spiritually religious without fear of political coercion, something she could never have in a Muslim country: &#8220;No Muslim country would allow me the rights I have here.&#8221; She knows she is being monitored from abroad, since she received her fatwa by e-mail from Saudi Arabia. How would they have known about her if she were not being informed on by Islamists here? She cannot fathom why politicians pander to the Islamists. Actually she can fathom it. &#8220;Political correctness&#8221; will not allow politicians to raise the question of allegiance in their Muslim supporters.</p>
<p>As for feminists, where are they? Also pandering. They have not spoken up about the Talibanist woman in Mississauga who teaches the virtues of polygamy to her female students, nor have they criticized a cleric who openly admits to performing polygamous marriages. Feminists seem to have lower expectations for Muslim women than for themselves: what Tarek Fatah calls &#8220;left wing racism.&#8221; Ms Raza is, according to an Islamist website, #5 of the &#8220;most hated Muslims in the world.&#8221; &#8220;My aim,&#8221; she chuckles, &#8220;is to become #1.&#8221;</p>
<p>The air began to crackle with political electricity when Samaa Elibyan, a Muslim journalist with close ties to the Canadian Islamic Congress, and an admirer of the infamous Taliban apologist Yvonne Ridley, stood up to challenge the panel&rsquo;s right to criticize Samira Laouni, NDP candidate in Bourassa riding, who was not present, for her Islamist views of Sharia law. Mr Mansur and Mr Fatah reminded her that if the NDP had the right to pick an Islamist candidate &mdash; and they do &mdash; then anyone else has the right to criticize that choice, including &#8220;the right to insult you.&#8221; After the conference, predictably enough, Radio-Canada were all over Ms Elibyan for her views. Not a single reporter was interested in interviewing the three brave hearts who are trying to warn us of a clear and present danger that nobody, least of all the people tasked with protecting us from our enemies, wants to talk about. <br>

			<p><i>&ldquo;Political correctness&rdquo; will not allow politicians to raise the question of allegiance in their Muslim supporters.</i></p>
<p>People frequently say that politicians are &#8220;politically correct&#8221;, and that somehow explains them. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that at all - it&rsquo;s that politicians have no courage, and currently it takes no courage to be politically correct.</p>

			<p>Both the Islamicists and the multicult have a common objective in terminating freedom of speech. This is why PC elites in the West can support radical Islamicism, despite the latter&rsquo;s illiberality. Both have a common political objective in censorship. </p>

A brief glossary for non-Canadian readers: </p>
<p>NDP = New Democratic Party. In addition to the Conservatives and the Liberals   &mdash;   roughly the equivalent of Republicans and Democracts in the US   &mdash;   Canada also has a third major party, to the left of the Liberals. The NDP bill themselves as &#8220;social democrats&#8221; but are more like the far left, Howard Dean wing of America&rsquo;s Democratic party; or the equally-appalling modern-day edition of Britain&rsquo;s Labour Party (AKA &#8220;New Labour&#8221; or &#8220;NuLabour&#8221;) . Like many left-of-centre orgs, the NDP have an honorable history and an utterly disgraceful present-day. Once Canada&rsquo;s party of organized labor, the New Democrats have in recent years completely abandoned decent working-class white people in favor of fashionable Third World minorities (as well as the usual domestic gaggle of college profs, naive students, professional feminists, radical eco nuts, etc). I think it is safe to say that no political party in Canada now has more CONTEMPT for blue-collar caucasians than the one supposedly formed in their name. I can guarantee you that NOBODY in that party EVER watches Larry the Cable Guy or says &#8220;Git &#8216;er done!&#8221; They DESPISE people like that. </p>
<p>Jack Layton = &#8220;Taliban Jack&#8221; = NDP leader. Layton got his nickname for wanting to keep Canadian troops out of Afghanistan, and &#8220;negotiate&#8221; with the Taliban instead. It is presumably with Taliban Jack&rsquo;s blessings that the NDP is now running a record number of candidates in the upcoming (Oct. 14) federal election with unpronounceable Muslim names&hellip;and also, apparently, Radical Islamist agendas. </p>
<p>Tarek Fatah = moderate and enlightened Canadian Muslim who has been very supportive of conservative journalist Mark Steyn during Steyn&rsquo;s persecution by four (count &#8216;em!) separate Human Rights Commissions (three provincial, plus federal). Muslims in the west like Fatah, Salim Mansur and Raheel Raza need our support. </p>
<p>Now, admittedly, some of us here at AmRen would prefer that the number of Muslims in the West be ZERO   &mdash;   but until that happy day arrives, working with these moderate Muslims to prevent the further rise of Sharia-promoting, hand-chopping extremist Muslims is about the best we can do. <br>

			<p>The US also has a party left of the liberals. It is led by the communist, socialist, radical islamofascist, Barak Hussein Obama. Within a few months of his coronation whites will be disarmed, anyone making a comment derrogatory to the tyrant regime will be imprisoned and put on government projects. This will be overseen by armed blacks, government agencies and hispanics. Amren will be abolished, along with any media unfavorable to the tyrannical government. </p>

			<p><i>Within a few months of his coronation whites will be disarmed, anyone making a comment derrogatory to the tyrant regime will be imprisoned.<br>
  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
I don&rsquo;t think it will be &#8220;within a few months&#8221;.  Not likely. That would be too radical and sudden a change and would provoke civil unrest   &mdash;   even revolution.  &#8220;Change&#8221;, as Obama likes to call it, will come about gradually, insidiously, a little at a time. That&rsquo;s the tried and true strategy.  It&rsquo;s like cooking that proverbial frog in the pot of warm water, a little bit warmer all the time, so that it doesn&rsquo;t notice the difference, or get upset, or try to jump out.</i></p>
<p>And the programs that he initiates won&rsquo;t be accomplished within four years either. Not by any means. But the judges he makes and the policies he implements will have long-lasting effects going far beyond him. I&rsquo;d say, check back in twenty or thirty years to see the real &#8220;change&#8221;.   By that time, you&rsquo;ll be old and your children will never have known anything else, so  (like the frog) those &#8220;changes&#8221; will seem completely normal to them.</p>
<p>Just look at the government programs and policies that were implemented under  FDR, Truman, etc.   &mdash;  - Who would ever have imagined back then when Truman integrated the Army or Eisenhower integrated the schools, or JFK first used the term Affirmative Action  (so good and generous sounding back then!) what they would have led to by 2008?  Who would have imagined when the immigration law was &#8220;changed&#8221; back in 1965, the Third World invasion that it would lead to today?</p>
<p>No, Obama&rsquo;s handlers (and be assured that he has handlers, as they all do) will know better than to push their luck too hard. They have been having an extremely successful run thus far, taking over the USA little by little, conquering us without a shot fired, over several generations. Why get impatient and mess it up now? They may be evil and devious, but they are not stupid.<br>

			<p>The large Canadian cities are now a wasteland of foreigners.</p>
<p>The above post is correct about the NDP.  The champion also of the gays.</p>
<p>Vancouver, the new Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Toronto, third world full of blacks.</p>
<p>Montreal, same thing.</p>
<p>Canada is lost to the foreigners, just like all the other western nations.</p>
<p>Political correctness, accomodation, pandering, led by corrupt politicians and jewish media.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yesterday an NDP candidate in Toronto Centre &mdash; an immigration lawyer, Farouk El-Khaki &mdash; accused the judiciary of being anti-Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting.  Another immigration lawyer, Ali Naqvi, is running for the federal NDP in Etobicoke.</p>
<p>His brother Yasir Naqvi is the Liberal Party MPP in Ottawa center.</p>
<p>Both are Pakistanis.</p>

<p>Historical periods in America are cyclical.  The 1980s are compared to the roaring twenties while the 2000s are a convergence of the 1960s counterculture and the 1930s Depression Era.  Our mortgage meltdown is comparable to the stock market crash which led to a worldwide economic downturn.  If we elect the wrong person (Obama) we might end up with another JFK grassy knoll event orchestrated by the left to reinvigorate their movement.  We can&rsquo;t afford to go through more &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movements or retreat from Iraq at this moment in time.  We have the opportunity to squash the kooks under our boots so don&rsquo;t repeat the same errors in history that were made before.   </p>

			<p>We are having the same problems in the USA &amp; Islamists are just waiting for this years Presidential Election. They see an ally in Obama, weather real or perceived &amp; have a strong Lobbying Group in Washington,DC. Obama is without a Socialist/marxist &amp; the Leftist<br>
Democrats are blind to it. Most of our younger Voters have been indoctrinated in school &amp; College, they think Conservatives &amp; the Republican right are destroying America, when it is exactly the opposite. Obama &amp; Democratic Congress are responsible the the Economic struggle we are going through now. The Republicans are not blameless, by no means, but Democrats monitoring the economic agencies kept saying everything is fine, while lining their pockets to the detriment of the American Taxpayer. Bush &amp; McCain warned Congress in 2004 &amp; McCain again in 2007, that they needed to reign in dangerous policies of Fannie Mae &amp; Mac. Muslims see this as a time to organize &amp; vote as a group to make sure Obama gets elected. Governor Palin, hopefully will reunify Patriotic Americans that want their Constitutional Republic of The United States back. We will not allow our Constitutional Guarantees infringed upon by a Socialistic Presidential Candidate or a Left Wing Democratically controlled Congress. Obama will try to disarm American Citizens &amp; that will never be allowed to happen.</p>

			<p>The NDP has indeed lost touch with its roots, which was originally all about protecting the blue-collar and rural workers in this country and ensuring labour rights. In the last election, the NDP didn&rsquo;t win a single seat in Saskatchewan, its birthplace. Not surprising! The NDP is the most politically correct party in this country and avidly courts Islamists, anti-Americans, 9/11 hoax claimers, and so forth. It&rsquo;s a party to vote for if you hate America, hate the current model of Canada, hate western freedom of speech, and hate anything that isn&rsquo;t ultra-lefty. The only good thing I have to say is that it doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance of winning the next federal election.</p>

			<p>Muslims are contemptuous of all non-Muslim values.  These medieval throwbacks are demented control freaks who have always wanted to rule the world and force Islam upon everyone, the same as the communists want to do with communism.</p>
<p>And in America the degenerate Mexicans have been added to the mix, since they want to rule America and force their language and idiotic criminal and corrupt culture down our throats.</p>
<p>The major problem facing Americans in the days ahead will be who to target first&hellip;<br>

			<p>&#8220;I TOLD YOU SO&#8221;:  And exactly what do believe America&rsquo;s 70 million (mostly white) riflemen will be doing?  Do you believe everyone will roll over for an African communist tyrant? Do you believe the congress would allow this to happen knowing those who support Obama on this would become targets?  As much as Obama and his handlers would love to do this they value their lives enough to not even try.  After all, unlike the disarmed and demoralized British civilians, we have the Second Amendment and we are still in possession of our testicles.  Destroying ones domestic enemies and traitors during a revolution, insurrection or armed revolt is just like eating potato chips; you can never stop at just one&hellip;<br>

			<p>&#8220;And exactly what do believe America&rsquo;s 70 million (mostly white) riflemen will be doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Americans did nothing when their schools were integrated at bayonet point, its unlikely they would do anything now. Riflemen would not matter much against mechanized infantry anyway, there are US Army battalions deployed in the USA now&hellip; </p>

That&rsquo;s exactly right. I have to laugh at these invisible tough guys who bluster and swagger on the internet. Where have they been all these years? For half a century, white Americans have backed down and backed down some more, yielding ground at every point. Where were those 70 million brave riflemen all this time?</p>

			<p>Information Insurgent:  Comparing forced school integration in the south to having a black communist as president is a weak analogy.</p>
<p>And let me point out that our mighty military with its mechanized infantry is unable to pacify a handful of third world Iraqis and Afghans after many years of trying.  They couldn&rsquo;t defeat a third world nation populated by 90 pound rice farmers after a 14 year occupation of their country.  They haven&rsquo;t won a war since WWII.  We have more to fear from a troop of angry Girl Scouts than our minority ridden military.</p>
<p>The few remaining whites in the military today mostly fill combat roles and I doubt they would wage war on their own people and their own race at the behest of a white hating communist black commander in chief who never served in the military or fought in a single battle.  <br>

<p>You make some good points here. Maybe they couldn&rsquo;t defeat 90 pound rice farmers.  But they have successfully cowed the American populace. (Integration was FORCED on us, wasn&rsquo;t it?)</p>
<p>However, if all the above is true, then why have whites allowed themselves to be pushed further and further out of the picture, as their country has been stripped from them and given away to others over the past half century, ever since their schools were integrated at bayonet point in 1953?  Through riots, affirmative action, and all the rest, there hasn&rsquo;t been much more than just some sullen grumbling. What does it take?</p>
<p>You still haven&rsquo;t answered the question:  WHERE are those 70 million angry reflemen?<br>
