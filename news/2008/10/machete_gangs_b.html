			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Graham Tibbetts, Telegraph (London), Oct. 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The practice has brought terror to parts of South Africa, where it is estimated that at least 300 people are killed each year for the medicine, known as muti.</p>
<p>One victim was Fortune Khumalo, a boy of nine, who was attacked as he relieved himself in bushes.</p>
<p>His attacker sliced off his penis and testicles to sell to a traditional healer in Johannesburg, where body parts can fetch £250 and a human head up to £500, according to the research for Channel 4&rsquo;s Unreported World.</p>
<p>Fortune survived the attack but is in constant pain because his family cannot afford the reconstructive surgery he needs. His assailant was caught with the boy&rsquo;s genitalia wrapped in a towel in his pocket.</p>
<p>Thomas Khumalo, Fortune&rsquo;s father, said: &ldquo;The killings are driven by greed. People believe using human body parts in medicine can make them rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special superintendent Gerard Labuschagne, an expert on ritual killings, said traditional healers are behind the killings, prescribing body parts to patients and hiring men to go out and find them.</p>
<p>Human genitals are the most prized parts and can be used to attract wealth and increase fertility. They are cooked and ground down for use with herbs and other ingredients.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s body parts are thought to be the most potent and victims are often tortured first as the pain is believed to add to the power.</p>
<p>In the town of Bizana in Eastern Cape 18 people were murdered by a muti gang in nine months.</p>
<p>Vigilante gangs now patrol the area at night because they are concerned the police are not catching the culprits.</p>
<p>Bongani Danga, who leads the vigilantes, said: &ldquo;People are really scared. Even with a police presence here, the killings continued so we decided we had to act to protect ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many muti murders go unreported but Supt Labuschagne admitted that even those which are reported may not be fully investigated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An investigative officer tasked to deal with this might be a bit hesitant because of his own traditional beliefs,&rdquo; he said.<br>

			<p>Quick, we need to bring this rich and vibrant culture to the USA, where it can benefit us and help us navigate the Global Economy of the 21st Century.  Bring them here!  Bring them all here!  Diversity is our greatest strength!  Also, please raise my taxes to pay for all the various needs of these new immigrants.  Please also replace all the current police, firemen, teachers, judges, shop keepers, dog catchers, and candle makers with people from that race (although race is only a social construct), so that these new immigrants can see &#8220;faces that look like them.&#8221;  We have so much to learn from these rich traditional societies   &mdash;   much wisdom!</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;ll blame the legacy of apartheid for this.</p>
<p>South Africa has among the strictest gun control laws on the books, but, people who are hell-bent on murder, will find a way.</p>
<p>To think that South Africa had the first human heart transplant recorded; now, it is reverting back to more traditional African medical practices. What could be the difference, I wonder?</p>
<p>African medicine is to medicine, as African architecture is to architecture.  </p>

<p>This explanation is just an excuse for sadism.  At least it is not blamed on apartheid and white racism as.</p>
<p>In this country, black torture and murder of their own children is generally blamed on slavery, segregation, inner cities and evil whitey.</p>

			<p>I love how the tone of the article is matter of fact&hellip;.as if this was in the bounds of normal human behavior if driven by enough greed.</p>
<p>From top to bottom, evil permeates these societies.  The neutral term &#8220;traditional healer&#8221; is explicitly being used to cover up what this is&hellip;.satanic witchcraft.  These societies take for granted that doing heinous acts of unmitigated evil brings a person success and power through supernatural means.  Almost the inverse of what pervades the Christian west.</p>
<p>A populations&rsquo; spiritual beliefs reflect the character of those people (or perhaps, the term monsters is more appropriate because this is not within the bounds of human behavior).  And what this says about them is that civilization should have absolutely nothing to do with them and, in no way, consider them in the same category as us.</p>
<p>What they do.  What they are.  Should make them pariah of the international community.</p>

			<p>The whites and blacks of South Africa - Rainbow my a!! They couldn&rsquo;t be anymore different. Whites designed the top-notch infrastructure, blacks abuse it to failure. Ghandi had choice things to say about the &#8220;comman keffir&#8221;, and nobel prize winner Albert Schweitzer warned about mixing and living as equals among them. </p>
<p>Geographic separation - its the only compassionate solution I see. </p>

<p>Greed, plus the stupidity to believe in that stuff, plus pure evil to be willing to use medicine made from torturing the innocent.</p>

			<p>In spite of such horror stories of unfathomable stupidity that are always coming up, when a Nobel Prize winning scientist like Dr. Watson suggests that sub-Saharan Africans are not as intelligent as Europeans (on average) and should be dealt with differently he gets hounded out of his profession as a racist not to be listened to. </p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t educated whites face the truth about sub-Saharan black Africans that Dr Watson was trying to convey?<br>

			<p>I cringe at the characterization of this gang as a &#8220;machete&#8221; gang, as if the machetes are at fault.  No, it&rsquo;s a black gang.</p>
<p>The British press are bad for this.  They love to throw around the monikers &#8220;gun gang&#8221; and &#8220;knife gang,&#8221; as much as the American media throw around &#8220;gun crime&#8221; and &#8220;knife crime.&#8221;  Last I looked, an inanimate object was not able to commit a crime on its own.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s funny. I don&rsquo;t recall stories about murderers running wild in the streets of South Africa or Zimbabwe when those countries were under white rule.</p>
<p>I also can&rsquo;t figure out why Detroit, Newark, Harlem and Brixton in the UK had much lower crime rates when they were white neighborhoods. </p>

<p>This sums up nicely the difference between white rule and black rule. Under white rule, S.Africa was the pioneer in the first heart transplant, under black rule, S.Africa is cutting off gentials to be used as a fertility potient. Ah, that&rsquo;s that we call progress folks!!</p>

			<p>As someone who lived there for 24 years until we escaped in 1999, we were very frustrated at the Marxist propaganda that the world was fed by the terrorists now in power.  The African whites were planning to develop such barbaric practices out of the tribes that would occasionally burn women to death as witches.  That was one of the intentions of Apartheid, to protect others from such criminal activities and educate the masses to be civilised but some of the silly parts of Apartheid (no mixed marriages, no living together in mixed areas, etc) were blown up and the Western world believed that the black Africans were the same advanced people as they are without bothering to read and believe the facts.   </p>
<p>It is the same still with many ignorant people in the West.   The changes allowing Marxist terrorists to take power has set the region back by at least 100 years.</p>

It also brought back the memory or that frontier being conquered when I was like eight years old. now it`s  a slap in the face wake up call to a man moving deeply into middle age. I`ll be musing on this well into the second cup of coffee.</p>

To Question Diversity:</p>
<p>The Buffalo News does the same thing. It must be the PC standard format. I read in the paper, &#8216;a man with a silver handgun robbed a bank&hellip;&rsquo;. I believe they mean &#8216;silver-colored handgun&rsquo; but even so, it&rsquo;s always the color of the gun and not a description of the suspect. Also, they often describe what they were wearing such as &#8216;a white tee-shirt and jeans&rsquo; as if the suspect doesn&rsquo;t change their clothes.</p>
<p>I assume they do this because if they give the description as a black man, then all black men become suspects. The way they do it now, ALL MEN wearing white tee-shirts are stigmatized as criminals and innocent people are left without a means to identify which people are dangerous criminals.<br>

			<p>The &#8216;Apartheid&rsquo; policy of the previous ruling National Party, which was instituted from around 1948 to 1990, was roundly condemned by international opinion and following extreme pressure from virtually the entire World (the USA was probably  old South Africa&rsquo;s biggest and most hateful enemy).<br>
This little article might go someway in trying to justtify in the minds of the hostile and sceptics why the &#8216;Apartheid&rsquo; policy was ever conceived and instituted in the first place.</p>

			<p>These sick stories of violence in S Africa, are never covered by Western media. One only learns about them through the web, on sites like this, who dare to reveal the truth about what is going on in countries like South Africa today. They bury stories about black criminals, even when they happen in America, such as the Christian/Newsom murders. But oh, how they jump on white crimes with glee. I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I have read internet postings from Blacks sarcastically referring to whites as serial killers, and child molesters. They know all about Jeffery Dahmer and any other infamous white killer, but remain oblivious of what their own people are up to in Africa in terms of murder and child rapes. Ignorance is bliss!</p>

<p><br>
It&rsquo;s impossible to overemphasize this - there was a witch doctor gang that got caught years ago that admitted they routinely tortured young children for <b>hours</b> before chopping them up.  They claimed the children&rsquo;s screams made the &#8220;medicine&#8221; more powerful.  </p>

			<p>Nothing can excuse this kind of typical African behavior, but as we all know, Africans are impulse driven. Maybe if the little boy&rsquo;s parents had taught him to use indoor plumbing the &#8220;gang&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t have been overwhelmed by the sight of him &#8220;relieving himself in the bushes&#8221; and had irresistable impulses to torture and murder him for the valuable body parts.</p>

			<p>I watched this UK Channel 4 documentary last night. &#8216;Muti&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s associated &#8216;sangoma&rsquo; and &#8216;voodoo&rsquo; practices have been around most of africa for centuries, if not millennia. Black african culture and beliefs are steeped in such witchcraft and they took the rituals with them to the Caribbean, USA and everywhere else they were settled. &#8216;Papa Doc&rsquo; Duval and his &#8216;Ton-Ton Macout&rsquo; government were practitioners as they found it an excellent way to keep their superstitious people in order. The torso of a 4 year black boy pulled from the river Thames a couple of years ago proved that &#8216;muti&rsquo; is flourishing in London today just as it is in any black african community worldwide, it&rsquo;s just that there is the silence of fear surrounding it and Whites are not normally involved. The final sentence of this AMREN story tells it all, even the South African police (black) don&rsquo;t like to investigate too deeply because of their own traditional beliefs. I love pork, and you probably do too, but black africans have a particular fondness as the meat tastes very like human flesh and the african  &#8216;pidgin&rsquo; for this is &#8216;long-pig&rsquo;. You probably don&rsquo;t believe me so check it out for yourself. The smoke from Menthol cigarettes is close to some traditional african herbs which are inhaled whilst smouldering in a darkened hut during men-only gatherings and &#8216;kools&rsquo; outsell all other brands in africa, so now you know! Body parts collected for &#8216;muti&rsquo; must be from live victims (as bits from the dead have no potency) and the screams of terror only add to the power of the &#8216;medicine&rsquo;. Enjoy your research, you will find the subject astounding and followers could even be in your neibourhood right now. Soon be hallowe&rsquo;en eh? Trick or treat? </p>

<p><br>
I&rsquo;m surprised they admitted that, since most stories about African witchcraft try to downplay it and make it sound rare.  But it&rsquo;s estimated that up to 80% of black South Africans visit witch doctors 3 or more times per year (per &#8220;Horrific murders in name of ritual medicine&#8221; in Scotland on Sunday in July 2002).  These beliefs are mainstream and widespread.  </p>

			<p>Since diversity is such a benefit to us all, I think bringing one of these &#8220;machete&#8221; gangs into the US as immigrants and giving them a house in a liberal town like Santa Cruz, California would be perfect.  Since these immigrants would be economically disadvantaged, I think pre-paid gift cards for Lowe&rsquo;s or Home Depot should be given to them so they can buy new machetes.  Forcing them to use rusty, old machetes would probably damage their self-esteem.</p>
<p>Diversity is especially good for children, so I think the new house for the gang should be next door to an elementary school.</p>

<p>     As one who has produced a documentary on African traditional medicine (Witchdoctors:A Day in the Other Africa), I must state without fear or favor that the nefarious pratices of a few rogue traditional doctors can bring down a whole institution.The traditional healer (Sangoma) is relied upon for most medical needs in rural Africa.Regrettably, the bad ones are now garnering publicity.For a start, I wish to reiterate what the president of traditional doctors in the South African Province of Kwazulunatal once said about witchdoctors who request body parts for treatments etc: &#8220;Anybody who requests human body parts for medicinal (MUTI)purposes is a witch and deserves to be hanged&#8221;.I concur with that statement.<br>
   During my research prior to my film,I googled &#8220;authentic Sangomas&#8221; and one name kept coming up: Ma Bhengu in the village of Kwangcolosi in the Valley of 1000 Hills-South Africa.Shewas profiled in the Sunday Times Travel section in South Africa and haseven trained a white girl from Howick who became aprominent Sangoma.I finally succeeded to get in touch with her and even filmed her and other traditional healers.The octogenarian Ma Bhengu and all those sangomas trained by her under an apprentice system will never request body parts for any panacea and will even refer cases they cannot solve to Western doctors.<br>
   I wish to take this opportunity to thank President George W.Bush for setting up th PEPFAR (President&rsquo;s Emergency PLan For AIDS Relief)in Africa in which genuine traditional doctors like Ma Bhengu work handing hand with western doctors to alleviate te symptoms of AIDS while treating other diseases as well.Kudos to Senator John Mccain and Barrack Obama for vowing to continue the program.<br>
 It should dawn on all Africans that using body parts or mutilating people for medicinal purposes is not only devilish but very very primitive.Hard work,friendship,networking,personal responsibility can be a gold mine ofmoney not body parts!</p>

			<p>I am white and living in South Africa, It is true black people believe and practice these things. My mother works at a public hospital ( which last functioned properly during apartheid) 75 % off all her patients come in after they went to see a sangoma (witch doctor) and then, surprise- surprise got more sic.  Almost all of them got aids but that being a different matter all together. Everything at the hospital now has to get bolted down otherwise it gets stolen, and they call this madness freedom. Earlier this year 2008 a black man sitting in reception points to a poster on the wall and asks my mother: is that aids inside or outside the body? My mother looks up at the poster and sees a picture of the planet earth written underneath was,: aids a world wide problem. He could not recognize the planet EARTH.</p>

			<p>The ANC, the political machine that has run South Africa since Apartheid fell, is a fully Marxist entity originally backed by the Soviets. Look it up.</p>
<p>Under Apartheid, South Africa&rsquo;s GNP was 75% of the entire continent&rsquo;s. There were more black African doctors, lawyers and millionaires than in the rest of the continent combined. There were three times as many black college graduates than in the rest of Africa combined. Despite the ills of apartheid, there was massive immigration of black Africans, legal and illegal, into South Africa.</p>
<p>While Apartheid was distasteful, I&rsquo;d have to say it mirrored directly the American position on its&rsquo; own indigenous population. I wonder what would have become of America had Europe shamed us into giving political power to the American Indians. Certainly, things would&rsquo;ve been different. Things are different now in South Africa. Since the ANC took over, crime has become so rampant that accurate statistics are no longer even attempted to be kept. Unemployment has risen to almost 30%.</p>
<p>Remember, South Africa was destroyed in just 10 years.</p>
<p>A little research on the head of the ANC, Jacob Zuma, is instructive:</p>

			<p>In Zimbabwwe and South Africa, as in many cities in the U.S., the major ongoing &lsquo;story&rsquo; that is never told is black-on-white violence and murder. The sheer numbers of it, were it laid bare and allowed to be absorbed without PC-filtering by the public at large, would change the face of American politics. Which is obviously why it&rsquo;s papered-over.</p>
<p>The horrible, sad rate of black-on-black violence gets discussion (and glorification in the popular culture.) The rate of black-on-white violence is actually higher. I think 75% of the American populace would probably swear it isn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>The massacre of white farmers in Zimbabwe and the wave of violence against white families in South Africa is untouched in the U.S. media. Not to mention the level of violence in those countries, period, regardless of race. That I actually would research it and dare to mention it makes me one of those &lsquo;dark forces of intolerance on the far right,&rsquo; I guess.<br>

			<p>I guess if you&rsquo;re a person inclined to become a howling machete wielder in less than 20 years (and of course I&rsquo;m going along with the fiction that this is new behavior in SA, brought about after the end of White rule, instead of being the very behavior Apartheid was designed to isolate), Apartheid might seem distasteful. And maybe if you&rsquo;re an observer in another country, its probably distasteful.</p>
<p>To the hard working, Christian Boers who built SA from a wasteland inhabited by nearly no one, helped by no one, it was no more distasteful than a wall around a medieval city was to an attacking party. I guess it depends on if you&rsquo;re looking outwards at a bunch of machete wielding orcs who are howling for your wealth, land, and possessions, or if you&rsquo;re thousands of miles away sitting in your living room watching the news tell you how evil Apartheid is.<br>

			<p>Gee, I wonder if there exists any serious peer-reviewed double-blind research studies addressing the use of witch doctor themed proactive medical approaches to the treatment of standard disorders and diseases?  Have these been published in peer-reviewed journals of science and medicine?  In the West?  In the East?  The North or South?  Anywhere?</p>
<p>I think that we here at AmRen are being prematurely judgmental and biased about witchcraft in Africa.  After all, can&rsquo;t we just get along?  We have so much to learn from these people.  And we have so little to share with them.  They are not interested in space ships and moon landings, the concept of forward time, preventative medicine and preventative self actions.  All of our actions from the time we crawled out of the slime to now have been wasted, misdirected and for naught.  Slap myself on the side of my head!  What were WE thinking?  Of course!  It is obvious now.  Africa, Africa, the great Green Mother of all life.  We must sit at the feet of the Witch Doctor, take notes and learn all there is to know.</p>
<p>Class will be completed in ten minutes.  (Its an easy &#8216;A&rsquo; guys.  Looks good on the transcript).</p>

			<p>&#8220;These sick stories of violence in S Africa, are never covered by Western media. One only learns about them through the web, on sites like this, who dare to reveal the truth about what is going on in countries like South Africa today. They bury stories about black criminals, even when they happen in America, such as the Christian/Newsom murders. But oh, how they jump on white crimes with glee. I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I have read internet postings from Blacks sarcastically referring to whites as serial killers, and child molesters. They know all about Jeffery Dahmer and any other infamous white killer, but remain oblivious of what their own people are up to in Africa in terms of murder and child rapes. Ignorance is bliss!</p>

<p>How true it is. Reminds me of the media blackout surrounding the Zebra murders committed by a sect of Black Muslims operating out of Mosque 26 located in San Francisco, California from 1973 until 1974, which left at least 16 people dead, and many wounded. The media just doesn&rsquo;t report.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I love pork, and you probably do too, but black africans have a particular fondness as the meat tastes very like human flesh and the african &lsquo;pidgin&rsquo; for this is &lsquo;long-pig&rsquo;. You probably don&rsquo;t believe me so check it out for yourself. The smoke from Menthol cigarettes is close to some traditional african herbs which are inhaled whilst smouldering in a darkened hut during men-only gatherings and &lsquo;kools&rsquo; outsell all other brands in africa, so now you know! Body parts collected for &lsquo;muti&rsquo; must be from live victims (as bits from the dead have no potency) and the screams of terror only add to the power of the &lsquo;medicine&rsquo;. Enjoy your research, you will find the subject astounding and followers could even be in your neibourhood right now. Soon be hallowe&rsquo;en eh? Trick or treat?&#8221;<br>

Give me a break.  I smoke menthols and my German relatives eat pork daily.</p>
<p>My ancestors must have been cannibals who burned herbs in their huts just outside of Munich&hellip;</p>
<p>Such stereotypical generalizations give impetus to multicultural Marxists.  Please stop.</p>

			<p>I guess its already been covered on this list. MANY South African blacks believe that the cure for aids is to have sex with a virgin.</p>
<p>In the time I&rsquo;ve taken to write this, two more South African women have been raped.<br>

			<p>Raped child tells of attack at Kameeldrift home:</p>
<p>Prayers were the only defence left to a desperate father when four armed black men invaded his Kameeldrift homestead in the early hours of Tuesday-morning.</p>
<p>The four men terrorised the unarmed family and raped their virgin 16-year-old child Helene. (all the names have been changed to protect their identities). Johannes Swart, wife Marie, son Gerhard, 15 and daughters Helene 16 and Rentia, 7 were attacked at around 3:30am while asleep in their beds. The gang robbed only some minor,unimportant items, said the father - but the most precious property they stole was the innocence of their precious child Helene. <a href="https://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2417531,00.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2417531,00.html</a></p>
<p>Helene was unable to speak for a long time after the ordeal. She now is still very traumatised and ill from the antiretroviral medication she had to be given to prevent AIDS-transfer from the rapist.</p>
<p>Three of the armed men held the rest of the family at gunpoint while the fourth armed men came into her bedroom, tied her up and threatened to kill her with a gun. He also threatened to shoot her father. And in the parents&rsquo; bedroom, just above Helene&rsquo;s, all the father could do was to pray out loud and ask the Lord that He must change the mentality of their attackers. &#8220;That&rsquo;s when I heard Helene shout, &#8216;eina&rsquo; (ouch) and I prayed again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helene said she was very confused and hurt after the rape. The rapist took her back to the parental bedroom, and tied her up with the rest of the family before leaving. They had failed to tie up little Rentia, who cut them all lose with a pair of scissors. Now Helene gets frequent bouts of nausea and feels very ill because of the antiretroviral medication she was given to try and prevent infection with the virus causing AIDS, which is very prevalent among black South African men. She has to use this medication for the next three months before she&rsquo;ll find out whether she was also infected with AIDS. Mrs Swart says her son has also become very angry since the attack and the rape of his sister. This family will never be the same again.<br>
