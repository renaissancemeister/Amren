<h1>Qld Man Refuses to Take Down Aussie Flag</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ninemsn (Sydney), October 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Queensland man says he will disregard an order by a council in south-east Queensland to lower his Australian flag, after a neighbour complained it was &#8220;offensive&#8221;.</p>
<p>Logan City resident Aaron Wilson erected a five metre flagpole eight weeks ago to honour friends who served in Iraq.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, council staff at Logan City just south of Brisbane contacted Mr Wilson to tell him a neighbour had complained.</p>
<p>Mr Wilson was told he could face legal action if the flagpole was not removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find it astonishing that anyone could find the Australian flag offensive,&#8221; he told the Courier-Mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;My family and friends have served for the country and the very least I can do is have a flag to show my appreciation for Australia.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Logan City Council spokeswoman said there was concern the flagpole could fall down in high winds.</p>
<p>She said Mr Wilson needed a building permit, because the pole was only 4.5m from the kerb and, under the Queensland Development Code, it should be at least 6m from the front.</p>
<p>Mr Wilson said he would not be moving the flag.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t see how moving the flag back a bit is going to stop it being offensive,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Logan City mayor Pam Parker said she backed Mr Wilson in his desire to fly the national flag.</p>
<p>However, Ms Parker could not rule out his having to move the flagpole.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am offended that somebody should complain to the council about the Australian flag, and whoever they are should hang their head in shame,&#8221; she told ABC Radio.</p>
<p>Ms Parker said the flagpole had &#8220;setback issues&#8221; which she would discuss with council officers.<br>
