				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>P.J. Gladnick, NewsBusters, October 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In last night&rsquo;s post-debate analysis on CNN&rsquo;s Anderson Cooper 360, James Carville proclaimed that Barack Obama will be the slam dunk winner of the election in November. However, he followed up by hinting at riots if Obama were to lose. Here is the transcript of the discussion. First David Gergen keeps bringing up the race factor as an excuse for a possible Obama loss (emphasis mine):</p>
<p>ANDERSON COOPER: But if you look at the CNN poll which Campbell Brown just told us about the short time ago, on the economy, Obama 59 percent and McCain 36 percent. David Gergen, do you agree with John King and James Carville that if those numbers continue it&rsquo;s basically game over?</p>
<p>DAVID GERGEN: I think it&rsquo;s too early to declare victory Anderson, because Barack Obama is black. And until we play out the issue of race in this country, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll know and maybe unless &mdash; late in the campaign.</p>
<p>COOPER: Do you think that despite the lead in the polls, people might change their minds once they&rsquo;re actually in the voting booth?</p>
<p>GERGEN: I&rsquo;m not sure the polls are totally believable, I think there&rsquo;s &mdash; there maybe built in. Over the years there&rsquo;s a study now that&rsquo;s come out of Stanford University and Associate Press along with Yahoo, saying that is &mdash; that his blackness may cost him as much as six points {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CAMPBELL BROWN: Yes, I think we have the graphics ready for this. And this is a little more generic but who expressed his views more clearly in the debate. 60 percent said Obama, McCain 30 percent. Who spent more time attacking his opponent; McCain 63 percent, to Obama&rsquo;s 17 percent. Who seemed to be the strongest leader in the debate; 54 percent for Obama to 43 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>COOPER: So they&rsquo;re not going to run a commercial with James Carville saying the dogs are wet bring them in or whatever that &mdash; I can&rsquo;t remember exactly or do the laundry or I can&rsquo;t remember what it was.</p>
<p>CARVILLE: Let me be clear, I said you can call the dogs and light the fire and leave the house. I think it sounds over.</p>
<p>Now let me be clear here, if Obama goes in this race with a 5- point lead and losing this election, the consequences are &mdash; bull, man. I mean I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to happen, but I think David it&rsquo;s a point to bring up.</p>
<p>But you stop and contemplate this country if Obama goes in and he has a consistent five point lead and loses the election, it would be very, very, very dramatic out there.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think James Carville is hinting at riots, he&rsquo;s encouraging riots.</p>
<p>Ironically, back in May, while Carville was still on the HRC bandwagon, and she was winning primaries on OH, PA and WV against Obama after he had built a big lead, Carville denied that Hillary was getting the votes of &#8220;racist&#8221; white Democrats, and that he wouldn&rsquo;t impugn someone&rsquo;s motive for doing so.  So it&rsquo;s alright to be &#8220;white racist&#8221; to pick a white Democrat over a black Democrat, but not alright to do the same with a white RINO/Republican over a black Democrat.</p>

			<p>Interesting that Democrats didn&rsquo;t warn of blacks rioting when it was still Hillary against Barry Obama. But now that it&rsquo;s McCain against him, the blacks will riot if he doesn&rsquo;t win.</p>

			<p>It won&rsquo;t happen.  Obama may lose, but blacks won&rsquo;t riot.  I think that takes a localized event such as a police shooting to spark a riot.  There will just be a lot of grumbling and complaining.  Business as usual for them.</p>

			<p>What does it say about Blacks when big name political analysts hint that they might riot if their man loses?  Even a sick freak like James Carville knows that the Blacks have never really left the jungle.</p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter because if he wins it&rsquo;s eventually going to get really bad anyways when the money runs out and the fast clip of inserting money into the economy makes it worth less and less and less and less&hellip;</p>

			<p>If there are riots, they will be in DC, NYC, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and all the other ultra liberal cities.  Hopefully the most affected areas will be the wealthy ultra liberal neighborhoods.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see black rioters on the upper west side of NYC, Georgetown in DC and the North side of Chicago.  Maybe the south side blacks of Chicago will invade Hyde Park and burn down Bill Ayers and Bernadette Dorhn&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Burn baby burn!!!!!!!!</p>

			<p>Sounds like a threat to me. And I don&rsquo;t like being threatened. Let blacks riot. Let then burn down their &#8216;hoods&rsquo; and then they can live in more squalidness. Appeasement is a self-defeating strategy.</p>

			<p>Riots are fine by me if they provide to kick in the rear White people need.  (Also blacks tend to burn down their own neighborhoods when they riot, but that&rsquo;s another issue.)  <br>
Attention White Men:  Obama is a world communist, black people hate you and will continue to hate you no matter what you give them or what you do.  Most of the world pines for your destruction, and worst of all you blindly participate in their machinations.  Wake up!!!</p>

			<p>I fear Carville is right, but that it will be more than angry blacks rioting when Obama loses.  I expect the agitators that are pressing for Obama will evolve into domestic terrorists when he loses.</p>
<p>I thought the liberals had given it all they had during the last election.  I had no idea how far they could go to create such an unlevel playing field, but this time around I really do think that they&rsquo;re throwing all they have left into The One, both legal and illegal.  When they lose this time, they&rsquo;ll turn violent.  I&rsquo;m ready for that, and anything that comes over my fence belongs to me.</p>

			<p>If he wins, they will riot. <br>
If he loses they will riot. </p>
<p>In either event, I will be voting (legally armed) and taking the day off on wednesday. If they want to riot, I say bring it on. They have underestimated the anger of the productive members of society. </p>

			<p>Pray that Obama looses big.  Who cares if BLACKS riot, I have five boxes of buckshot and two bricks of 22cal.  I have 5 sandbags and 2 spools of razor concertina wire with which to join my neigbors in blockadeing our community.  BLACKS don&rsquo;t realize that each of their cities depends on a Food Distribution Center for supplies.  I would like to send BLACK leaders some packages of BIC butane lighters and some Colemen Stove fuel.  Does anyone know where to send the stuff?</p>

			<p>Win or lose, I think there will be rioting by the blacks. If the Detroit Pistons win the N.B.A. championship, they riot. If they lose, they riot. They may just be a little more excited about a big election. Surely, they will be goaded by Jesse and Al and all the other assorted troublemakers out there.</p>

			<p>So blacks will react like children with an adult tantrum - again. Big deal.  </p>
<p>As in the past when something doesn&rsquo;t go their racial way, the&rsquo;ll burn down their communities, kill a few of each other and the random white person. Well over half of the people in Detroit, Flint and Pontiac, MI. (black cities) are welfare section 8 people who don&rsquo;t own their homes so if they go up, they&rsquo;ll just be given another place to live.  In other words, they don&rsquo;t care because they have nothing to lose.</p>
<p>The federal government will then hemmorage tax money into these communities giving huge tax breaks to anyone who wants to start a business, and even the start-up cash.  The feds will build new homes and other structures free of charge. Most of the money will dissappear into the pockets of the local black politians and &#8220;community activists&#8221;. It&rsquo;s an old, crazy pattern that&rsquo;s been repeated since the 60&rsquo;s.   </p>
<p>Why should blacks care?  The government rewards their tantrums and savagery every time they riot, and what you reward, you get more of.  Of course, to blacks, it won&rsquo;t be enough.   </p>

			<p>Which whites do blacks have the most access to?  Who is likely to be the victims of black violence if it comes to that?</p>
<p>Liberals.  That&rsquo;s who.</p>
<p>Although ANY whites that are victimized, would be a tradgedy, one cannot help but wonder what would happen in this country if blacks and liberals are no longer able to tolerate each other.</p>
<p>A hell of alot of problems could be dealt with openly, honestly and effectively if that were to happen.</p>

			<p>Although I detest McCain and will NOT vote for him, I just cannot&hellip;cannot imagine Obama actually winning this election. It isn&rsquo;t just about race - the man is so unapologetically leftist, so far out of the mainstream in his beliefs&hellip;all captured in his own words(see Phyllis Schllafly article above)that is defies all reason that he could actually become president. That America would elect a black president really doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all in this day and age(I have heard  enough people on this site insist they would vote for a black if he were &#8220;conservative&#8221; enough for heavens&rsquo; sake!?!). But to vote for THIS black man?? I just can&rsquo;t believe we have fallen this far&hellip;</p>

			<p>A Ruger 10/22 with a scope, along with several thousand rounds of .22LR is a prudent &#8220;investment&#8221; for ANYONE living in an urban area! Make sure you have a bunch of spare mags; don&rsquo;t be UNPREPARED like the Korean shopkeepers in 1992&rsquo;s LA riots where they ran out of ammo! The most important thing to have during a gun battle is AMMUNITION.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Korean American community, seeing the police force&rsquo;s abandonment of Koreatown, swiftly organized a self-defense squad composed of veteran Marines and workers, who entered the fray. Open gun battles were televised as Korean shopkeepers and the self-defense group took to using firearms to protect their businesses (often their sole livelihood) from crowds of violent looters. (One of the volunteers, 18-year-old Edward Lee, was killed in the crossfire that evening.)&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots</a></p>
<p>Photos in the newspapers at the time showed Koreans using ham radio walkie-talkies to coordinate defense.</p>
<p>Remember, gun control is supported by the Democratic Party in order to allow the miscreant minorities to reign over Whitey.</p>
<p>Buy your guns and ammo NOW before the government BANS the sale of ammo and guns when the riots begin, LIKE THEY DID IN 1992 LOS ANGELES.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>

<p>For the record, my Browning HP 9mm saved my butt on 22nd Ave., Miami 1980.  Otherwise, I could have ended up like the two white teen boys, looking for gas for their car at the wrong time/wrong place. They were trapped in Liberty City with their eyes gouged out with a screwdriver. No, riots don&rsquo;t scare me. I now carry a .45 and a marine shotgun, 12ga buck of course. Mr. Carville was merely performing a civic duty- warning us to be prepared.</p>

			<p>Make sure your firearm is in perfect working order, you have plenty of ammo, and enough food, water and other necessities for several days or maybe even 2 weeks, then vote and go straidht home and stay there! With luck you live in an area where the riots won&rsquo;t flare up, or if they do they will be just a flash in the pan, but be prepared  &mdash;  just in case. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d love to see black rioters on the upper west side of NYC, Georgetown in DC and the North side of Chicago. Maybe the south side blacks of Chicago will invade Hyde Park and burn down Bill Ayers and Bernadette Dorhn&rsquo;s house.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Future generations will have to invoke selective breeding so that the black race will be less of a threat and a burden for everyone else.  It is pathetic that this country will always have the threat of a black person as the possiblity of being President.  It is for this very reason that France does not allow any person of color in any high office whether political or otherwise.</p>
<p>The change that whites are thinking is not what Obama is thinking.  His true identity is being a black radical.  Any person who does not see this is in denial.  He has used ACORN in the past and now presently to fulfil his own political ambitions.  What ACORN is doing for Obama is minor compared to the amount of corruption when he is elected President.  Obama is more devious than past blacks, e.g. the Black Panthers, Jessie Jackson, Al Sharpton.  At least, they were upfront regarding their racial hatred and wanting handouts from others.</p>
<p>Obama having graduated from Harvard adds to his disguise.  Whites and others have allowed themselves to be deluded by his education, his mannerisms, his smooth sales pitches, etc. </p>
<p>Life is tough for everyone.  The ONLY reason in this time and age that blacks is still stuck in their pathetic station in life is because of the genetic endowment given to them by the Divine.  Blacks had zero civilization of anykind when encountered by other races in Africa.  And this is not due to suppression or oppression by other races.  They had NO civilization to be &#8220;stolen&#8221; by anyone.  </p>

			<p>The real riots will come when Fedgov goes bankrupt and the public assistance, public employee, school system, university, section 8 and other glorified welfare checks start bouncing or are no longer accepted by anyone with anything to sell or rent. The way things are going, that could happen sooner than most people think. The Diversity Depression could be the earthquake that topples this antiwhite &#8220;Unamerican Empire&#8221; and stuffs it into the dustbin of history. What are parasites like Carville going to do then?</p>

			<p>Yes&hellip;Carville does epitomize the Demos/Democratic party..&#8221;Very dramatic out there&#8221;?! Well spoken by the Drama Queen hisherself! Besides..last I knew American citizens had the RIGHT to cast there vote based on whatever criteria they believed in, whether race, party, philosophy, or track record etc&hellip;Personaly I have (0) malice towards Barak or other mulattos or blacks in general I prefer the company of whites obviously,  especially if they act white but if this man becomes president I&rsquo;d give him a chance and wish him well for his benifit and our nation. This country needs MORE dignity accountability and self reliance BUT LESS DAMN DRAMA! Humble work is far more worthy than arrogent self pity, regardless of your physiogonomy or skin color.</p>

			<p>I am highly dubious of all of this &#8216;blacks will riot if Obama looses&rsquo; stuff I keep hearing.  I was a probation officer in a major city for years and I can tell you, the only blacks who will give a damn are the middle class ones with jobs and houses.</p>
<p>There was a black basketball player making a clown of himself on you tube the other day saying F- the national anthem, and all of this stuff and I had to laugh.  One of the other things he said was &#8216;F- Obama and all that S-, I&rsquo;m black god-damnit!&rsquo;  And that is the black ghetto mentality, a thug gets beaten by some cops- riot, you team wins (or looses) the NBA championship - mini riot,   black president, who cares!</p>
<p>These people don&rsquo;t read, don&rsquo;t watch anything but rap videos and consider Obama just another sellout Uncle Tom anyway.  If there is some large-scale riot following the election, I will garauntee you it is some sort of a neo-con coup attempt to impose martial law, just like 9-ll, and that&rsquo;s a hell of a lot scarier than any black riot.</p>

			<p>&#8220;CARVILLE: Let me be clear, I said you can call the dogs and light the fire and leave the house. I think it sounds over.</p>
<p>Now let me be clear here, if Obama goes in this race with a 5- point lead and losing this election, the consequences are &mdash; bull, man. I mean I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to happen, but I think David it&rsquo;s a point to bring up.</p>
<p>But you stop and contemplate this country if Obama goes in and he has a consistent five point lead and loses the election, it would be very, very, very dramatic out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the vicious Marxist viper (his own wife&rsquo;s nickname for him in the past was &#8220;serpant head&#8221;) Comrade Carville hisses his insinuated &#8220;premonitions&#8221; of riots and attacks on whites by blacks, should the mulatto &#8220;savior&#8221; not be elected. </p>
<p>Particularly, if he maintains a 5-point lead up to that day of his defeat at the sneaky &#8220;racist&#8221; hands of whiety?</p>
<p>Give me a break!</p>
<p>I once said not too long ago that people like Comrade Serpant Head, are not just predicting such race riots to push Comrade BO into the White House through a campaign of terrorism tolerance, but encouraging it to amuse themselves when they (once again) lose an election because of their Marxism. Here we have a good example of this, from one of their seasoned Clinton politico &#8220;masterminds;&#8221; a call to stick it to whiety, no matter what. </p>
<p>Indeed, a measure of madness, or just plain hopeful abominations and audacious hatreds seen in the light of day?<br>
These people are not normal; they border on being inhumanly warped by the level of their truely evil and depraved passions that pass for thought, in a Marxist abyss of masochistic racial &#8220;dialectics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did anyone else catch that old queen Chris Matthews&rsquo; near ecstatic and (Harliquine Romance novel) sexualized style of describing of how he &#8220;thought&#8221; the debate should play out, on MSNBC last night in the pre-debate &#8220;discussions&#8221; on Hardball?</p>
<p>He went into a bizarre homoerotic frenzy of predicting that Senator McCain would be the &#8220;charging,&#8221; &#8220;pawing,&#8221; and &#8220;sorting&#8221; old bull, to Comrade BO&rsquo;s &#8220;slim, young matador&#8221; in the debates. With Comrade BO sidestepping him with his flashy Red &#8220;cape,&#8221; at every turn.</p>
<p>Again, give me a break!</p>
<p>Say what you will about the AR crowd here or of the anti-multicultural movement in general, but we do not feel compelled to describe Senator McCain as a man wearing a General Custer uniform and slapping at Comrade BOs flimsily loinclothed bottom with his own feathered headdress!</p>
<p>These strange and freakish creatures are what they are, but we can Thank God they are more often wrong then right,</p>
<p>If not, God help us all!</p>

<p>Posted earlier by HH</p>
<p>I also have less than warm &amp; fuzzy feelings for McCain. I think he is a PTSD poster-child with an anti-white bias. Having said that however, to not vote for him is giving the election to Obama. While everyone knows that the lesser of two evils is still evil, I think in this case the &#8220;matter-of-degree&#8221; aspect of the situation forces a default vote for McCain. </p>

			<p>Blacks never have anything to lose.  Of course they will riot either way.  The damage will be cleaned up neat and tidy, all will be forgiven.  Then they will be handed their new batch of rewards, at our expense.  The riots will be called a &#8220;disturbance&#8221;, and they can call for repartations for all that was supposedly lost by the black man.  This is EXACTLY what happened during the LA riots.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s amusing to me listening to all this big talk from locked and loaded farmers and weekend hunter/weekend warrior types ready for the &#8220;revolution.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived through two riots in Los Angeles. Right through the eye of the storm. Southgate, CA right next to Watts in 65 (though I was just a little kid) and the 92 riots in Los Angeles as a man. A few things you need to know. </p>
<p>The gangs that lead the rioting efforts number a couple hundred thousand heads strong (not counting all their bg associates which add another million or two heads to the count when things really kick off) and are very well armed with semi-automatic rifles and pistols but also explosives which they toss under vehicles occassionally. Except for seasoned older heads who have been in the drug game for a long time and done their pen time, they have almost no body armor though. </p>
<p>Now the police aren&rsquo;t going to be there when the riot occurs. They are AOL.. normally barricaded in their stations which groups of blacks and browns led by gangmembers are attacking to pin them down. So you&rsquo;re on your own until the national guard arrives whenever.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing though&hellip; they&rsquo;ve stripped almost all gun rights from our hands. We&rsquo;ve gone from a city where you could buy guns second hand out of the Los Angeles Times and the recycler or your neighbor to a highly controlled authoritarian police environment just in my lifetime. You must buy your weapons from an authorized guy dealer (fingerprints, waiting periods, weapon limits, etc&hellip;) or it&rsquo;s a crime. Period. </p>
<p>As a result, most of your soccor mom/dad WASPS out here don&rsquo;t own a gun and the ones that do cannot use them effectively (they took a single gun safety course once to get the permit to even buy the gun, went to the range a couple times, and that was it). They certainly don&rsquo;t have any armor laying around. Their home defense comes down to a home alarm, an earthquake preparedness kit, and a phone to call the police who won&rsquo;t be there when the riot kicks off.</p>
<p>Now if you are the type (and there are some) that are really prepared but start shooting the gangsters as they enter your neighborhood, they will ride on you with a lot of heads. If you survive, they will raise a stink with the police when they finally do arrive (on the heels of the national  guard) and you will be charged with serious felonious crimes that you will most likely do many years in the pen for. Stick a fork in you: you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>It is what it is fellas. My advice, is to do what we do when the riots kick off: get your head down. Cover is good. Properly prepare and when it kicks off, pull your loved ones inside, and hunker down. Unless they break into your home to do their wickedness, you won&rsquo;t have a leg to stand on if you use lethal force. You ride it out in your barricaded home and let the national guard deal with it when they finally arrive. That&rsquo;s how it works in reality. </p>

			<p>GOOD NEWS FOR THE GOOD GUYS!!!!!</p>
<p>BREAKING: Word in Chicago: Patrick Fitzgerald heading RICO investigation of ACORN and BHO campaign<br>
hillbuzz via Hillary Clinton Forum ^ | 10-9-08 |  </p>
<p>Posted on Wednesday, October 08, 2008 11:40:53 PM by Anti-Hillary</p>
<p>Tonight we talked to someone who works in the federal courts here in Chicago. </p>
<p>The buzz in those corridors is that federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has been leading a team of FBI investigators in 10 states working on a RICO case. </p>
<p>Today, it was announced that ACORN is being investigated in 10 states. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one Hell of a coincidence. </p>
<p>We asked why Fitzgerald would be involved in this, because he&rsquo;s the prosecutor on the Tony Rezko case and we aren&rsquo;t aware of ACORN being investigated in Illinois. </p>
<p>We were told that ACORN was investigated in Illinois years ago, and it was a Fitzgerald case then. This means ACORN&rsquo;s activities today, involving a conspiracy to commit multi-state voter fraud on SoetorObama&rsquo;s behalf, are an extension of that previous ACORN case. </p>
<p>Our source in federal courts said, &ldquo;Any crime that involves more than two people and is carried out across state lines qualifies as a corrupt organization. The fact that those &ldquo;Goodwill&rdquo; donations were made in Texas and received at Obama headquarters in Chicago or Washington means it qualifies for RICO.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The &ldquo;Goodwill donations&rdquo; referred to above are the $228 million in undocumented, unverified campaign contributions the SoetorObama camp has received  &mdash;  which the McCain campaigned filed a complaint to the FEC on this past Monday. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also heard that the Clinton campaign filed complaints to the FBI and other federal agencies over Senator Obama&rsquo;s fraud in the Iowa, Texas and other caucuses: voter intimidation, registration fraud, and other illegal activities. </p>
<p>The last thing we were told tonight in regards to all of this was that &ldquo;the tmeme here is a tying together of all these various threads. That&rsquo;s what you will see in the last weeks of the campaign: all things being tied together&rdquo;. </p>
<p>If everything rumored here is true, it looks like David Axelrod, Howard Dean, Donna Brazile, Senator Obama himself, and possibly even Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid were all involved, together, in massive RICO violations, and thus federal fraud, if the DNC and party leadership knew what the SoetorObama campaign and ACORN were up to and allowed it to proceed. Knowledge of federal crimes being committed makes all parties accessories to those crimes  &mdash;  and part of the conspiracy to defraud the public. <br>

			<p>The statement about Blacks being unsurpassed in intellectual brilliance, and being responsible for mathmatics and scientific inventions, clearly shows he is an afrocentrist. He probably not only thinks that Blacks built the pyramids, but also conquered Europe and Asia, and established their civilizations. Meaning, he is an uneducated fool. The one thing he is right about however, is that there will very likely be wide-spread riots throughout the country if Obama loses. Blacks love any excuse to riot and loot anyway. It is simply a given! Though it will set blacks back another hundred years, and keep them out of the political arena even longer.</p>

			<p>Soros and his hedge fund pals are doing part of the strategy on the markets. Shorting, options and credit default swaps (CDS).</p>
<p>Options = Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).<br>
CDS = Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)</p>
<p>Other strategies also running in tandem is ACORN vote theft.</p>
<p>Note in Cloward-Piven - open borders. HUD today said illegals account for 5 million mortgages that have blown up or are total fraud. I was amazed someone at HUD let that out.</p>
<p>We have been telling Bush and McCain for 8 + years about illegals.</p>
<p>The bombs, like Ayers SDS bombs, were set with CRA in lawsuits against banks files by Acord lawyers like&hellip;OBAMA, infiltrating Fannie and Freddie to sell off junk mortgages to infect banks and investment banks. Infect all banks on a global basis like a virus.</p>
<p>Followed by Soros and his hedge fund pals to pick off the companies one by one in cooridinated attacks - Countrywide, Fannie &amp; Freddie, Bear Stears, Indy Mac, Lehman, Wachovia and on and on. They made tens of billions.</p>
<p>Now take down the markets. Followed by bringing dear leader on CBS, Fox and NBC to assure us.</p>
<p>The good news is we know what they are doing. I hope McCain-Palin also knows. This is going to get uglier.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this a little where I live as well.  The last time I was in the gun store there were a few young blacks in there stocking up on ammo with big smiles on their faces.  It was very unusual.  Of course, the store has been packed everyday for the past month with whites buying guns and ammo like I&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>A Ruger 10/22 with a scope, along with several thousand rounds of .22LR is a prudent &ldquo;investment&rdquo; for ANYONE living in an urban area! Make sure you have a bunch of spare mags; don&rsquo;t be UNPREPARED like the Korean shopkeepers in 1992&rsquo;s LA riots where they ran out of ammo! The most important thing to have during a gun battle is AMMUNITION.<br>
Posted by at 10:16 PM on October 8</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t bring a .22 into a war zone but it is more than enough to deal with any riot/home defense situation.  I agree with you: any whites who live in urban or suburban areas and don&rsquo;t own a gun need to buy one NOW. A Ruger 10/22 only costs about $200 and you can get 500 rounds of ammo for $20.  Spare mags are pretty cheap as well (make sure you have them loaded and ready to go on election night).  You and your family&rsquo;s life could depend on it.  Personally, I don&rsquo;t think there will be any riots but everyone should play it safe: 1) Make sure you have enough groceries and toiletries to last at least a couple of weeks; 2) make sure your family is in the house and the doors are locked when the election results start coming in; and 3) be careful for the days following the election - be aware of your surroundings and don&rsquo;t stray into any unfamiliar areas.<br>

			<p>&#8220;It is what it is fellas. My advice, is to do what we do when the riots kick off: get your head down. Cover is good. Properly prepare and when it kicks off, pull your loved ones inside, and hunker down. Unless they break into your home to do their wickedness, you won&rsquo;t have a leg to stand on if you use lethal force. You ride it out in your barricaded home and let the national guard deal with it when they finally arrive. That&rsquo;s how it works in reality.&#8221;  Posted by Unemployed WASP at 11:13 AM on October 9</p>
<p>With all due respect, guy, you must be a librarian or something, because that&rsquo;s about the most naive thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard regarding the defensive potential of whites in this country.  Read Chittum&rsquo;s book, Civil War II and learn a bit about the subject.</p>
<p>There are 210 million firearms in this country distributed, among 95 million people who are overwhelmingly white, many of whom have either military training, NRA practice skills, recreational shooters, hunters, etc., to say nothing of the militias that sprang into existence a few years ago and could so again at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>White response to attacks would be swift and overwhelming, and only someone who has little knowledge of military tactics and strategy would fail to understand that.  A white defensive gesture would completely decimate the ranks of anybody who was stupid enough to attack.</p>
<p>Your analysis and advice are quite humorous and a bit childish too.</p>

			<p>The well seasoned gun store owner down the street told me the same thing about the scoped 10/22 Ruger 7:35 PM. But he said to  put one in the leg (followed by one in the head if the perp keeps coming at you) once they have penetrated your home. </p>
<p>Personally, I would think a 12 guage semiautomatic with the shortest barrel legal possible (everything has to be completely legal of course) and 00 buckshot would be the way to go with a .45 semiautomatic pistol for a backup with a Type IIIa vest.</p>
<p>Throw a non lethal taser on the belt for good measure (maybe you&rsquo;ll get lucky and see the perp&rsquo;s approach and if he&rsquo;s unarmed&hellip;).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just talking so don&rsquo;t take my opinion on this and always get professional counsel and stay within the law (there&rsquo;s some advice you CAN take) but I think that&rsquo;s the setup I like. </p>

<p>I must respectfully disagree. That lesser of two evils business just doesn&rsquo;t fly anymore, no matter how you parse it. If the only reason one has for voting at all is because one vile traitor is slightly less loathsome than the other one, then the entire system has clearly failed, and voting at all is just a perverted charade! And indeed, that IS the case in America. Let&rsquo;s stop pretending - modern &#8220;democracy&#8221; is a sick joke. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, I happen to live in a state that Obama is certain to win handily anyway&hellip;so it would be just that much more insulting to vote for old Captain Amnesty!! </p>

<p>No librarian here&hellip; lol. I just don&rsquo;t live in your neck of the woods. I live in a city of over 10,000,000 people as a white minority and have lived through the midst of large inner city riots twice and a lot of urban crime for a long time. I&rsquo;ve seen how soft whites have become in this modern police state abaonding there responsibility to protect themselves and their families to the state (especially in the suburbs) and how the law works here. </p>
<p>I find your assertion that these whites will suddenly turn into brave effective minutemen overnight unrealistic. That bus left some time ago and it would take a culture shift to get it back I&rsquo;m afraid. It certainly hasn&rsquo;t happened in my lifetime. </p>
<p>What did happen is whites fled after the Watts Riots abandoning the urban areas of Los Angeles and same thing but on a smaller scale after the Rodney King riots in the areas affected. White  moving signs go up quick after a riot. If there were more than a handful of fatalities of blacks by whites during both of those riots, excluding LE and the national guard, I&rsquo;d like to hear about it. Because there were not.</p>
<p>You think what you want, it&rsquo;s a free country. I encourage everyone&rsquo;s right to disagree and discuss, but disrespecting another white man is a choice friend. While the days of dueling are long gone I don&rsquo;t think highly of those that engage in that behavior. </p>

			<p>This is all part of the The Obama/ACORN/Gallup/MSM Kenyan 2-Step Campaign Strategy</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how this works. Obama knows he&rsquo;s going to lose. So he gets ACORN to drum up millions of fraudulent Dem voter registrations. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that most of these fake registrations will never be used to vote, the idea is to inflate the number of Democrat voter registrations. This has been going on for over a year now. </p>
<p>Next, the pollsters say, Wow, look at all these new Dem registrations. We better re-weight our polling samples to compensate. Some polls do this innocently and you can see their internals. Other polls are in on the game and won&rsquo;t show you their internals. The re-weighted polls then naturally show Obama ahead, and the ones showing the biggest lead are the ones that keep their internals secret. </p>
<p>Carville, Mathews, Oberman, and the rest of the MSM then start saying that if Obama loses the election while the polls show him winning, there&rsquo;s gonna be riots. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Obama plants fake agitators at McCain rallys to shout violent, anti-Obama soundbites. The media then dutifully reports that McCain supporters are calling for violence against Obama. </p>
<p>Obama decries the violent nature of McCain supporters and gets his followers worked up, ready for a fight. Obama loses the election as he expects&hellip; Shazam! Obama supporters riot the day after the election. </p>
<p>Will there be as much murder and mayhem here as there was in Kenya after Odinga lost the election? Will Obama be able to wrest control of the U.S. government through this strategy like his cousin Odinga did in Kenya? Remains to be seen<br>

<p>My, my, my.  Such a low opinion of your fellow tribesmen. The warrior spirit is in many white males in this country, but I agree that almost all the weinies are in the large cities, living a protected existence, still trying to live life without leaving the womb.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did happen is whites fled after the Watts Riots abandoning the urban areas of Los Angeles and same thing but on a smaller scale after the Rodney King riots in the areas affected. White moving signs go up quick after a riot. If there were more than a handful of fatalities of blacks by whites during both of those riots, excluding LE and the national guard, I&rsquo;d like to hear about it. Because there were not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, old guy, you&rsquo;re argument really breaks down here, because the Watts riots were here and gone in just a few days, plus the natural reaction to any violent event is to pull back, secure oneself and take stock of the situation.  Too, do you believe that if the terrorism had continued with attacks on whites that whites would have failed to act?  If you do, you&rsquo;re speaking for yourself, not the rest of us who will stand and fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think what you want, it&rsquo;s a free country. I encourage everyone&rsquo;s right to disagree and discuss, but disrespecting another white man is a choice friend. While the days of dueling are long gone I don&rsquo;t think highly of those that engage in that behavior.&#8221; </p>
<p>Nor do I like to read a WN degrading whites with untrue, inaccurate information, because he might be so frightened he wants to discourage others from reacting. </p>

			<p>Nothing inaccurate about my information Mitch. Whites fled after the Watts riots. Southgate, for example, went from almost 100% white to under 1% white as a direct result of the Watts riot. Other cities with mostly white populations did likewise. This behavior has a name. It is called White Flight and all my life I&rsquo;ve observed it here in Southern California. This is historically factual infofrmation which you can verify for yourself. </p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve observed, and the statistics correlate, is that whites in a riot affected area hunker down or flee during the riot and then afterward many move away if they can. They also vote in politicans that are &#8220;tough on crime&#8221; meaning a great number of new laws have hit the books here during my lifetime and amount to whites seceding responsibility to protect themselves to law enforcement agencies. </p>
<p>And those farmers I was talking about aren&rsquo;t the farmers that own and work their land no way. Those are the salt in the earth and in them I have faith. I was talking about the farmers in Bakersfield and north of Bakersfield that hire the illegals to work their farms and then engage in big white nationlist talk. They are part of the problem not the solution no matter how many guns they own. </p>
<p>As for those weekend warriors, again I am not talking about the salt of the earth white men and women you find that live the American life and can handle their second amendment right just fine. No way. I am talking about the old fat white boozers that fled to the suburbs and talk the talk but cower and run when the criminal elements start rioting. </p>
<p>I can tell Mitch that you don&rsquo;t like what I&rsquo;m communicating to you from your replies (and no disrespect to you because I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re having this conversation as it gives me a chance to share what I&rsquo;ve witnessed for four decades here in SoCal); however, like I said: it is the truth.</p>
<p>And yes those rioters are well armed and have no conpunctions about using their weapons. The one saving grace is the areas they are burning and looting tend to be their own neighborhoods for the most part though they do spill over into ours if the riot is big enough (and the last one was and we saw some of that).</p>
<p>If whites had chosen a different path long ago then we would have a different situation here but they did not. Again, it is what it is. They didn&rsquo;t form into units and repel the invaders. They didn&rsquo;t even go vote in a political solution that prevented it from happening. They just voted to allow it to happen and then fled when the heat got to hot. That&rsquo;s what really happened and I watched it happen and though you don&rsquo;t like it I&rsquo;m telling you about it.</p>

<p>Of course you&rsquo;re right.  I&rsquo;m from Southern California myself.  But I think what you&rsquo;re not considering is that everything you are maintaining above has nothing at all to do with white reluctance to fight in a civil upheaval.  You&rsquo;re reference is to a flare up where people aren&rsquo;t about to regard it as a life or death situation as they would in large scale civil upheaval.  It has nothing to do with your orginal premise. </p>
<p>&#8220;What I&rsquo;ve observed, and the statistics correlate, is that whites in a riot affected area hunker down or flee during the riot and then afterward many move away if they can. They also vote in politicans that are &ldquo;tough on crime&rdquo; meaning a great number of new laws have hit the books here during my lifetime and amount to whites seceding responsibility to protect themselves to law enforcement agencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>With all due respect, old guy, that still has nothing to do with your orginal premise. Hunkering down in a violent flash point is only human nature and every animal on earth instinctively does it.</p>

They are part of the problem not the solution no matter how many guns they own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any upheaval by blacks over Obama will not just be confined to California, although you might keep in mind that California surprisingly had five different militia groups in the nineties. Don&rsquo;t underestimate your white acquaintances even if they are people you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for those weekend warriors, again I am not talking about the salt of the earth white men and women you find that live the American life and can handle their second amendment right just fine.

<p>But they wouldn&rsquo;t be involved in anything anyway, because even in our revolution against King George only 20% of the people were active.  We don&rsquo;t need them.  20% of 200 million people is 40 million.  That&rsquo;s bigger than most countries in the world. </p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell Mitch that you don&rsquo;t like what I&rsquo;m communicating to you from your replies (and no disrespect to you because I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re having this conversation as it gives me a chance to share what I&rsquo;ve witnessed for four decades here in SoCal); however, like I said: it is the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re right about the fact that there are whites that are next to useless, but my point is that they don&rsquo;t really matter any way.  It is the other courageous ones who will make the difference, and there&rsquo;s more than enough of them.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right again, but you can&rsquo;t expect people to sacrifice their lives in situations where their way of life and their freedoms are slowly taken away.  It just doesn&rsquo;t happen anywhere, nor has it happened at any time in history.  But, from that knowledge, it isn&rsquo;t logical to expect that whites will only talk about defending themselves, but really won&rsquo;t do anything, because they will, and there are more than enough aware whites in this country who are willing and capable enough to respond with an overwhelming force against any predator that seeks to annihilate or enslave us.</p>

<p>WASP reply: Cool. Then you know what I&rsquo;m talking about when I assert that whites cast the vote that created the situation we have here today and then fled when those decisions in the booth led to undesirable results on the street/in their communities. I do agree with your point here that white resistance would materialize if it was either (a) legitimately cosigned by the government [e.g. legitimately empowered by government authority) or (b) like you said life and death (e.g. just war theory). Neither occurred; however, and as a result the path of least resistance was taken which was to simply move away.</p>

<p>WASP Reply: I&rsquo;m not ready for the old folks home yet Mitch. I was training jiu-jitsu four times a week at the Gracie Center just four years ago. But yes I&rsquo;m middle aged now yet a clean living (no booze, tobacco, drugs, etc&hellip;) middle age. Anyways, I suppose my point is that the situation should not have been allowed to get to where it did and that it was the white vote, plain and simple, that enabled the situation to get so bad to where you had whites hunkering down and then moving away from their birthplaces. </p>
<p>WASP: &ldquo;And those farmers I was talking about aren&rsquo;t the farmers that own and work their land no way. Those are the salt in the earth and in them I have faith.

<p>WASP reply: I think Obama has the numbers to win now which will make the riots by blacks moot in the short term. In my opinion, he&rsquo;s an inexperienced senator (e.g. empty suit) raised by a communist mother with ties to black nationalism and Islam but that swing vote of white voters makes all the difference for him. That makes a dem legislature, dem executive branch, and dem appointed judicial. Clean sweep for the dems. Pat Buchanan just posted a good article titled &#8216;Liquidating the Empire&rsquo; where he makes the point that we are so in debt now that we&rsquo;ll have to print money and devalue the dollar and credit rating of the United States, raise taxes, and liquidate our empire. We&rsquo;re too deep in debt for other countries to simply lend us money anymore. Now what we shall see down the road as things get tough will be interesting. Will there be a voter revolution finally in our best interests? I don&rsquo;t know for sure but I hope we can formulate a political situation. That&rsquo;s what I want to see.</p>
<p>And yes it&rsquo;s true. I don&rsquo;t like men that drink alcohol until they piss themselves and pass out somewhere waking up with dew on them after day shooting in the desert while spitting tobacco juice everywhere and fighting amongst themselves. I really still have that esprit de corps from my time in the military (I&rsquo;m an honorably discharged veteran) and find it painful to be around low lifes. Maybe things will change someday. </p>

<p>WASP Reply: I agree but we need a culture shift really. A reactionary change in values that allow us to return the country back to the de facto world standard it was. That means we need the public education system back. In Los Angeles, it&rsquo;s just a public brainwashing indoctroniation center for modern liberalism with almost a 50% drop out rate here feeding LA gangs. We need to properly educate a generation Mitch&hellip; something this country used to do not so long ago. Obviously, I&rsquo;m not a nazi revolutionary or member of a white prison gang.. lol. I don&rsquo;t see that as the solution.</p>

But the nationalists I see too often on the streets or in the news are needle nazis and miscreants that prey on their own race or big talking fat alcoholics that can&rsquo;t act right or worse are part of the problem not the solution. You certainly don&rsquo;t sound like one of them Mitch and I&rsquo;m sure there are many more like you though. One of the reasons I was attracted to Jared and AR. Peace.</p>

			<p>I have followed this debate closely, and while both have good points, I must conclude that WASP is level headed and  makes the sounder argument than Mitch&rsquo;s blustering swagger.</p>
<p>Mitch says:  <i>&#8220;With all due respect, old guy, that still has nothing to do with your orginal premise&hellip;:&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Addressing WASP like that is not showing respect!  It&rsquo;s being smug, condescending, and cocky.  Mitch  says he  <i>&#8220;does not like to read a WN degrading other whites&#8221;, </i>and yet that is exactly what he is doing in this instance.</p>
<p>Mitch  refuses to listen to what he does not want to hear.  But  he needs to understand  that WASP is not degrading or ridiculing him, or wishing him harm, but rather is trying to offer him friendly, sound advice which Mitch, and those like him,  would be wise to heed. </p>
<p>Mitch says: <i>&#8220;Well, you&rsquo;re right about the fact that there are whites that are next to useless, but my point is that they don&rsquo;t really matter any way.&#8221;</i><br>
Such people are &#8220;useless&#8221;  and &#8220;don&rsquo;t really matter&#8221;?  Is that the way you talk about others after saying you don&rsquo;t  &#8220;like to read a WN degrading other whites&#8221;?</p>
<p>Mitch says:  <i>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t underestimate your white acquaintances even if they are people you don&rsquo;t like.&#8221; </i><br>
This comment is nonsense.  WASP doesn&rsquo;t  dislike them.  I&rsquo;m sure we all want Mitch to succeed, and we wish him well.  We  just don&rsquo;t want him to be killed. Simply because somebody disagrees with you doesn&rsquo;t mean he is against you. <br>

			<p>Thanks 4:03 PM on October 14. I hope these discussions help us all to see each other&rsquo;s perspective and find ways to get along. I&rsquo;ve been around and Mitch seems like a fine young man to me who will continue to mature. He&rsquo;s not perfected yet and neither am I. Honestly, I appreciate him caring enough about the subject to engage me on it. I wish whites talked more about what is happening in their cities, states, and country instead of just saying everything&rsquo;s &#8220;fine&#8221; or sticking their head in the sand. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, all we are really going to have is God and each other. Hence my distaste on whites voting for policies that yield undesirable results. Sure it&rsquo;s their democractic right but just because one can do something doesn&rsquo;t mean they should. I don&rsquo;t think many liberal white voters ever really took the time (or even have the capability) to work through the consequences of their actions.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I have followed this debate closely, and while both have good points, I must conclude that WASP is level headed and makes the sounder argument than Mitch&rsquo;s blustering swagger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitch:  Well, old guy this supportive post is suspiciously using the same inadequate phraseology and lack of logic that WASP uses.  I wonder if there&rsquo;s a connection?  And isn&rsquo;t it strange that it is sandwiched in between WASP&rsquo;s posts?</p>
<p>Quite frankly I&rsquo;m surprised that you were able to get it by the moderator, because it is obviously no more than a self-serving denigration of me, filled with gratuitous, unintelligent insults.  </p>
<p>Your original post criticized white nationalists who write of defending themselves if blacks riot and attack whites.  You said you thought it was ridiculous and:  &#8220;&ldquo;I find your assertion that these whites will suddenly turn into brave effective minutemen overnight unrealistic. That bus left some time ago and it would take a culture shift to get it back I&rsquo;m afraid. It certainly hasn&rsquo;t happened in my lifetime.&rdquo;<br>

<p>From this original premise you have flitted from one subject to another, first agreeing with me, then veering off on another matter, never addressing the core issue, but clumsily bringing up others, sometimes from paragraph to paragraph.</p>
<p>I would say to you to learn how to put your thoughts together properly before you enter into a debate and be more honest and forthcoming about who you are, refraining from making obnoxious assertions anonomously.</p>
<p>And, if there are other issues you&rsquo;d like to discuss that are off topic, all that is necessary is to click on to my email and contact me direct.</p>
<p>I have a wealth of information on the subject as I&rsquo;ve been analyzing this matter for years now.  </p>

<p>With all due respect, old guy, that entire litany comes across as no more than confused mumbo jumbo, which, unfortunately, seems to be an obvious attempt at denigration, because you can&rsquo;t adequately rebut any points I&rsquo;ve made, which is obvious to anyone who reads the thread.  No amount of spinning will change that.  It&rsquo;s perfectly clear. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lost site of the original issue.  The points I made were in response to your attempts at ridiculing and rebutting claims on here from people who are ready for action if blacks riot, resulting in attacks on whites, as Carville maintains in essence.  You wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s amusing to me listening to all this big talk from locked and loaded farmers and weekend hunter/weekend warrior types ready for the &ldquo;revolution.&rdquo; Posted by Unemployed WASP at 11:53 AM on October 10</p>
<p>I responded by pointing out that you were wrong and gave valid reasons as to why.</p>
<p>And you responded:</p>
<p>&#8220;I find your assertion that these whites will suddenly turn into brave effective minutemen overnight unrealistic. That bus left some time ago and it would take a culture shift to get it back I&rsquo;m afraid. It certainly hasn&rsquo;t happened in my lifetime.&#8221;<br>
Posted by Unemployed WASP at 11:53 AM on October 10</p>
<p>I went on to give excellent examples to prove you wrong, with the main one being that there are millions of whites who will gladly repel any attacks on them, their friends, and family, and that it is absurd to take the stance you do.</p>
<p>But you seemed to be so fixated on denigrating a good portion of white people I&rsquo;m wondering why you even post on this site.  You have vacillated from retracting your orginal claims to going back on them yet again, and so much of what you write is irrelevant to the point being discussed it comes across as a hysterical shotgun defense possibly because you feel your integrity is being questioned, and you regard rebuttals to what you write as personal attacks, which they are not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re all over the board, WASP, with responses to my points, except the crux of the matter which is that whites are in no way the cowards you give them credit for, and, quite frankly, I&rsquo;m at a loss to understand why you feel that way unless, as I offered earlier, your desire is to quell any talk of self defense because it frightens you.  What other reason could there be?  You have not refuted that. Were you aware that by not answering the question the implication is that it is a correct assumption?</p>
<p>If it were me, and I had differences with someone on a particular topic that couldn&rsquo;t be resolved in a forum format, I&rsquo;d be man enough to contact them off the site, if possible, where I could elaborate in greater detail what my position is.</p>
<p>I would not play games and offer denigration in place of sound argument.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Mitch says: &ldquo;With all due respect, old guy, that still has nothing to do with your orginal premise&hellip;:&rdquo;  Addressing WASP like that is not showing respect! It&rsquo;s being smug, condescending, and cocky. Mitch says he &ldquo;does not like to read a WN degrading other whites&rdquo;, and yet that is exactly what he is doing in this instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitch:  Let me offer just this one last comment for clarification.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old guy,&#8221; or &#8220;Old boy,&#8221; are just common terms as a way of addressing the person one is directing his comments to who is not known. The English use it quite commonly, and it&rsquo;s in use here in the US as well&hellip;..but not as much&hellip;.. if the writer wants to give the impression of a &#8220;folksy&#8221; reply&hellip;or in my case, it&rsquo;s done mostly out of habit, and I&rsquo;ve even used such terms before in addressing a teenager.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;re being a bit over sensitive to the term, because it&rsquo;s about as far away from a denigration referring to one&rsquo;s age as the phrase, &#8220;My friend,&#8221; or just plain &#8220;guy,&#8221; and even &#8220;young man,&#8221; when the age of the recipient is unknown?</p>
<p>&#8220;Mitch says he &ldquo;does not like to read a WN degrading other whites&rdquo;, and yet that is exactly what he is doing in this instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s false, but even if it were true, don&rsquo;t you understand that any comments of criticization by me were directed at just ONE WN&hellip;..you&hellip;..while your comments denigrated a very large segment of white people?  I mean, that&rsquo;s why your comments were contested to begin with.  Your comments denigrated all whites who were sounding fed up with being threatened, and many of them would react quite bravely to a threatening situation.</p>
<p>If you had maintained that there are a good portion of whites who brag about taking action, but they certainly will not,and <br>
they sound humorous to you, but added that there is a large contingent of them who have no reservation in doing so, I couldn&rsquo;t have agreed with those sentiments more.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, there&rsquo;s no way I could have agreed <br>
with your claims that the non-white gangs were anything exceptional to be worried about, because I know for a fact that they will be nothing but a nuisance compared to a vigorous white reaction.  The only time they should be regarded as overly dangerous and a threat to whites are in times like the present when whites are in just plain working mode, and the gangs are pursuing criminal activities as part of their standard operating procedure, because most whites, unlike non-whites are intelligent and most do not have problems with impulse control or a propensity for crime.</p>

			<p>Black rioting?<br>
Are you really that underminded, and hysterically stupid.<br>
White people riot just as much.<br>
Do you not know about the civil war.<br>
Southerners rioted and fired the first shots at fort sumter.<br>
Or the neo-nazis they were planning a riot in tenn.<br>
Do you honestly think if obama wins, that white people will not riot.<br>
Honestly.. It is time for a change, and you all arent ready for that.<br>
And Obama is half white.<br>
Black People help build this country.<br>
I bet half the people in your family has needed open heart surgery.<br>
and which was constructed by a black male.<br>
or the fact how many people would have had a horrible car accident.<br>
If it wasnt for the fact a black male was the one who created it.<br>
Maybe, you all should learn how to stop acting like children yourself.</p>
<p>And John Kennedy one of our greatest president was killed by a White male.</p>
<p>What black male has killed a president.</p>
<p>I am only fifteen and I was raised in a very goodhome. With hard times. My mother was a nurse and saved plenty of white females, and males.</p>
<p>I am way more mature, than you as adults would ever be.<br>

			<p>If Obama wins, the one sure thing I have heard from many people is the bullet in the head theory. I personally will not be using any of the health care for our kids as I don&rsquo;t trust anything that this socialist has up his sleeve. There is nothing for free and a handout usually has a hidden price for it. Freedom for one, I&rsquo;m selfish for. I like the idea of doing for myself and my family and don&rsquo;t need the handouts of the likes of Obama. <br>
 <br>
The black person who works hard and has american values, God bless them. That goes for the white person too. It&rsquo;s the ones,(black or white) who think anyone owes them a living or goes to blame rather then doing whatever job they can do to make a living. Personally, I would fight tooth and nail to keep the jobs selfishly that we let go to the illegals that have no business getting anything, unless they have a green card and are on the way to citizenship. Otherwise we have no one to blame but ourselves. I had to be on my own since I was 15. Never ended up on the streets, never thought I had to &#8220;sell&#8221; myself to a lower way of thinking and NEVER figured someone was going to make it right for me. I&rsquo;ve worked in fields, been a housekeeper, salesclerk, nurse aide, finally finishing the college thing as I had to pay for that myself as my parents were still using me as a deduction so I never qual&rsquo;d for aide for school. I&rsquo;m in my 50&rsquo;s now and can say I&rsquo;ve had a great life. By the way went for years with no health insurance and found when I needed a doctor they always helped with great arrangements so I still had my dignity intact. Did I mention that the illegals in this country have no problem with health insurance?<br>
I wish that the black and white people in this country who do think that this is black against white would just shut up for one minute and relize that we as americans have to finally get rid of the illegals and fight for what is ours and send them home. They have no business here, they are the true enemy within. There are jobs but we have to take them back and the strain the illegal has put on the health care system is criminal. Our problem was we as americans became soft. <br>
American means many people of many races together. Legally in the country defines us as american. All these people are who come to this country and just take the money and welfare and suck us dry of our resourses are bandits and we are the dupes. I personally choose not to be a dupe for a mexican bandit.<br>
If you vote for Obama to spread the wealth, it&rsquo;s socialism and a handout. No thank you Mr. Obama, you&rsquo;ll never be my president.<br>
It&rsquo;s time for america to start to be responsible.</p>

			<p>You riot mongering people are all NUTSO.  Think about your children, grandparents &amp; sick folk in the hospitals.  Nothing is worth rioting about to intelligent people.  You wackos out there with the guns and ammo a prepared for a shoot um up scenario ought to be ashamed of yourself.  I bet most of you claim to be Christian too!  What a crock.</p>
