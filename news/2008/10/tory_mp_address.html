				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Brooke, Daily Mail (London), Oct. 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Tory MP has provoked fury by accusing Britain&rsquo;s black police leaders of being racist.</p>
<p>David Davies said black police representatives in London had behaved worse than the apartheid regime in South Africa by urging ethnic minorities not to join the Metropolitan Police force.</p>
<p>In a speech to the National Black Police Association annual conference, he also slammed the organisation for not allowing white people interested in fighting racism to become full members.</p>
<p>His comments sparked an angry reaction from delegates. Up to a dozen walked out in protest and others slow-handclapped the MP for Monmouth, who was likened to a BNP extremist.</p>
<p>Many members had expected the more famous former shadow home secretary to be speaking and few recognised his namesake, who is also a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, when he stood up to speak.</p>
<p>But minutes later they were left open-mouthed by his straight-talking criticism of them.</p>
<p>Mr Davies, 38, told them the Black Police Association should do more to &lsquo;build trust and mutual respect between members of all races and religions within the force.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added :&rsquo;To me it is a shame that full membership of the BPA is open only to those of black, Asian or Middle Eastern origin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tackling racism and unfair treatment of ethnic minorities is something which is taken seriously by members of every race in the police force and yet the clear implication of such a policy is that white people do not share this concern.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said many white officers mistrusted the BPA because they were denied membership by a policy which &lsquo;would be unacceptable and probably illegal in virtually any other organisation in this country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Commenting on the race row embroiling the Metropolitan Police, Mr Davies pulled no punches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As a result of the decision to actively discourage members of the ethnic minorities from joining the Met, the BPA has become the only publicly-funded organisation to say that the police should be for whites only. That cannot be acceptable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went on: &lsquo;Not even the apartheid regime in South Africa prevented black and Asian people from joining the police force, where on earth are we going?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Davies said the BPA should follow the former Commission for Racial Equality and also be willing to represent white officers who have suffered discrimination at employment tribunals. He said black police leaders should &lsquo;not act and speak up for every ethnic group bar one.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Later, in a question and answer session, Mr Davies was forced to fend off a barrage of criticism, telling the conference: &lsquo;You invited me to come here, if you wanted someone just to turn up and give the same old speech you should have picked somebody else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dave Macfarlane, General Secretary of the London BPA, said: &lsquo;I am sick and tired of white people coming to us to insult us, he&rsquo;s like the BNP in the 1980&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Vinny Tomlinson from the Merseyside branch accused the MP of &lsquo;demonstrating ignorance and immaturity&rsquo; in his lack of understanding of race issues.</p>
<p>While US black police leader Ron Hampton told delegates in a reference to the MP: &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t allow people to disrespect you. Don&rsquo;t for one minute think what he said carries any weight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Commander Ali Dizaei, President of the NBPA, said he didn&rsquo;t accept the criticism. He said a white person could become an &lsquo;associate member&rsquo; and added: &lsquo;The organisation was created to represent the needs of ethnic monorities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dizaei, who is one of Britain&rsquo;s most senior ethnic minority police officers,  was suspended in September over links to a &lsquo;crooked lawyer&rsquo; revealed in the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police Authority took the decision to suspend him pending an inquiry into three separate allegations of misconduct.</p>
<p>Yesterday Mr Dizaei, 46, refused to comment on the matter except to say:&rsquo;Everybody is innocent until they are proven guilty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Despite the furore over his conduct, Mr Dizaei made a keynote speech to the conference calling for &lsquo;radical&rsquo; action to increase the use of ethnic minority officers in tackling terrorism and knife crime.</p>
<p>He also said the government should introduce a league tables style system for marking individual police force performance on the issues of race and equality.</p>
<p>The Home Office could punish the worst performers by reducing funding, he said.</p>

			<p>&#8220;than the apartheid regime in South Africa&#8221;. </p>
<p>What would all these pinko liberals do without Apartheid? Yet most of them never set foot in South Africa, or bothered to find out WHY the system was in place:</p>
<p>Maybe to protect a small number of whites against the African crime wave which has killed 250 000 people since Apartheid was forced down (i.e. in only 14 years)? <br>
Maybe to prevent the mass emigration of whites which has reached 20% of the white population (i.e. those that CAN get out)? <br>
Maybe to prevent the highest rape incidence in the world, when authorities knew what the criminal potential in the country was like? </p>
<p>When people actually bother to look under the bonnet of Apartheid and tally the crime and other statistics which our present benign ANC REGIME has brought forth, they may just begin to have second thoughts. But simply abusing Apartheid to justify yet another moronic liberal position is so much easier.</p>

			<p>I wonder if any of those white self-appointed elitists have ever had the intelligence to just stop one time and think about the horrific turn around they have endured in their country, which has caused whites to be objects of resentment and hatred by an ungrateful faction of people whose one and only desire is to reduce white power and influence any way they can, hoping they can then take over as the dominant race in that country.</p>
<p>They can wail all they want about low birth rates and providing for sustaining their economy but none of it has any kind of basis in fact, and the inclusion of non-whites into their country is causing great turmoil, and the resulting crime, violence, and hatred of their country by these rabble, has placed them on the edge of constant riotous conditions, something that should have been avoided at all costs. </p>
<p>Now, like the US, it will all result in war eventually.  That&rsquo;s not even an arguable point among sane, aware people. </p>
<p>No extremely pluralistic country in the history of mankind has survived, and no such preposterous utopia will ever exist for very long&hellip;&hellip;ever.  </p>
<p>One proposition I&rsquo;d like to put to those who don&rsquo;t believe what I am contending, let me ask this one question:  &#8220;Have these dunces ever succeeded at anything&hellip;..ever?&#8221; They can&rsquo;t even run their own lives without getting indicted, divorced, involved in silly domestic squabbles, plus they just can&rsquo;t handle even their own pitiful lives.  It&rsquo;s an absolute joke they think they know that diversity is just what we need. </p>

			<p>So the Black militants are discouraging nonwhites from joining London&rsquo;s police force and this Conservative is complaining?</p>
<p>He should encourage them to keep up the boycott and hopefully it will spread to the US.</p>

			<p>The recruitment of ethnics into the policeforce has been a disaster.</p>
<p>They are more likely to subvert investigations, they conive in &#8220;honour&#8221; violence and killings to protect community members, they are more likey to abuse their status and launch dozens of bogus &#8220;racism&#8221; claims in order to blackmail money out of the system.</p>
<p>The leader of this Association is currently suspended and has been the subject of a number of other investigations including expenses frauds, threatening behavior. Charges have previously been dropped, not through innocence, but because political pressure was brought to bear. </p>
<p>When policewoman Nisha Patel-Nasri was murdered she was held up as an example of a perfect officer with a brilliant career ahead of her and given a big public send off with senior officers present.</p>
<p>When her murderer, her own husband, was caught it transpired that he was a pimp and she had worked with him, using her warrant card to intimidate clients.</p>
<p>She had been reported for this but senior officers had covered it up as she was from an ethnic minority even though they knew about her husbands activities.</p>
<p>A white officer would have been dismissed in public disgrace.</p>
<p>So before the Black Police Association keeps on bleating about racism lets all know where the true racism is.</p>
<p>By blacks against whites, not just dodgy policemen but anti-white racist violence and discrimination, drugs, illegal immigration, benefit and housing frauds, AIDS and TB, knife and guin crime - and lets not forget - Islamic Terrorism. </p>
<p>England used to be a green and pleasant land. Now its just a multicultural hole. </p>

			<p>I do not approve of white leaders who denounce non-whites who practice ethnic separatism. Sure, it&rsquo;s hypocritical of them to do it while being adamantly opposed to us doing the same. But that&rsquo;s not the point. Who cares if they are hypocrites? Instead of attacking them for it, and demanding they join the mainstream by assimilating, we should build our own ethnic institutions that advocate for _our_ community.</p>

			<p>For there to be a &#8216;black&rsquo; police association there must already be &#8216;black&rsquo; police officers. Is it not possible that existing members fear a that greater number would dilute their effectiveness as a &#8216;minority&rsquo; black group? Later recruits are more likely to be muslim pakistani rather than black africans and this is not exactly what was expected when afro-caribbean &#8216;blacks&rsquo; formed the original association and simply lumped-in the few other &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; minorities to swell numbers and prove the &#8216;non-white&rsquo; basis of their primary aim. When muslim PCO&rsquo;s actively threaten violence to any white English christian civilians who attempt to enter the so called &#8216;muslim-only&rsquo; areas of northern England, this must wrankle the non-muslim blacks but they are powerless to object without they, themselves, being branded racist or islamaphobic. They have created this mess, lets see how they get out of it. Perhaps this speech is just the beginning of the process; when you find yourself in a big black hole, stop digging. </p>

			<p>&#8220;simply abusing Apartheid to justify yet another moronic liberal position is so much easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good point, about conjuring up visions of something like &#8216;apartheid&rsquo;, from somewhere thousands of miles away, in order to simply hurt and/or intimidate real people in the here and now. </p>
<p>Quite a good point. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice, however, that in this case it&rsquo;s a &#8216;conservative&rsquo; conjuring &#8216;apartheid&rsquo; in an effort to win his cause.  <br>

<p>Why not do both at the same time? Have our esteemed associations, while keeping them from &#8216;hate&rsquo; and the practice of doing the same? And all the while rail about the &#8216;injustice&rsquo; of it all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly been their modus operandi for time uncountable.  <br>

			<p>Folks,</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe.  Looking at this from another context&hellip;</p>
<p>This MP is simply pointing out the double-standard of a Black Association letting in everyone except White Britons?  (considering Pakistanis aren&rsquo;t technically &#8220;Black&#8221;?)</p>
<p>Of course he can&rsquo;t come right out and say it, so instead he does it under the guise of &#8220;Whites who want to fight racism&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>About time to shed light upon a very deceitful operation through laws.  If the goal is racial equality then all races need to be included. If not, then the racial imbalances continue with opposition groups fighting for turf.  The entire idea that traditional white founded nations MUST COMPLY to minority groups is ridiculous.  Just look at USA.  The Black Nationalists can not wait to bury white Amercians.  Their churches say so and they mean every word.  White countries and their leaders must stand up to the unreasonable demands of these offensive racists groups. Legitimacy must be behavior granted not extorted.    V</p>

			<p>&#8220;What would all these pinko liberals do without Apartheid? Yet most of them never set foot in South Africa, or bothered to find out WHY the system was in place&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly. It&rsquo;s the same  way they rail about past segregation in the &#8220;Old South&#8221;. It was never about the color of their skin but about certain behaviors that come in greater numbers with said skin color. As someone who grew up in the Deep Douth, I have a lot of experience with Blacks, seeing how one out of every three people in our town was Black. We know Blacks well. On an individual basis, Blacks can be nice, decent people and some are very intelligent. HOWEVER, in large numbers, Blacks  are a nightmare. They destroy any school or neighborhood they move into, turning it into a crime ridden slum. Wherever there are Blacks in large numbers, there is chaos, dysfunction, crime, poverty, corruption and a complete lack of a working society. This goes for any majority Black country, city, neighborhood or school, anywhere they are in large numbers. One simply can&rsquo;t live around Blacks in large numbers. Whites here in the USA and abroad who have had large numbers of Blacks move into their area quickly find out hence &#8220;white flight&#8221;. Those same Northerners who fought to desegregate the South fled long ago to the suburbs when Blacks moved in and brought their crime and chaos with them.</p>
