						<p>Hundreds of GTA Muslim men in polygamous marriages &mdash; some with a harem of wives &mdash; are receiving welfare and social benefits for each of their spouses, thanks to the city and province, Muslim leaders say.</p>
<p>Mumtaz Ali, president of the Canadian Society of Muslims, said wives in polygamous marriages are recognized as spouses under the Ontario Family Law Act, providing they were legally married under Muslim laws abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polygamy is a regular part of life for many Muslims,&#8221; Ali said yesterday. &#8220;Ontario recognizes religious marriages for Muslims and others.&#8221;</p>
<p>He estimates &#8220;several hundred&#8221; GTA husbands in polygamous marriages are receiving benefits. Under Islamic law, a Muslim man is permitted to have up to four spouses.</p>
<p>However, city and provincial officials said legally a welfare applicant can claim only one spouse. Other adults living in the same household can apply for welfare independently.</p>
<p>The average recipient with a child can receive about $1,500 monthly, city officials said.</p>
<p>FAMILY LAW ACT</p>
<p>In addressing the issue of polygamous marriages, the preamble to the Ontario Family Law Act states: &#8220;In the definition of &lsquo;spouse,&rsquo; a reference to marriage includes a marriage that is actually or potentially polygamous, if it was celebrated in a jurisdiction whose system of law recognizes it as valid. R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, s. 1 (2).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many people in the community who are taking advantage of this,&#8221; Ali said. &#8220;This is a law and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immigration officials said yesterday that polygamous marriages aren&rsquo;t allowed in Canada, but that contradicts the provincial law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Canada is a very liberal-minded country,&#8221; Ali said. &#8220;Canada is way ahead of Britain in this respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Britain recently began permitting husbands to collect benefits for each of their wives.</p>
<p>The British government recently admitted that nearly a thousand men are living legally with multiple wives in Britain. Although the families are entitled to claim social security for each wife, the department for work and pensions said it has not counted how many are on benefits.</p>
<p>In Canada, Ali said, the man and his main wife and children enter Canada as landed immigrants. The other spouses are sponsored or arrive as visitors to join their husband to share one home.</p>
<p>POSSIBLE FRAUD</p>
<p>The families receiving benefits didn&rsquo;t want their identities released because it can lead to questions by authorities on how they entered Canada and can mean an end to their benefits, Ali said.</p>
<p>Brenda Nesbitt, the city&rsquo;s director of social services, said benefits are only paid to one spouse and names and addresses are cross-checked for possible fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;There may be polygamous cases we are not aware off,&#8221; Nesbitt said yesterday. &#8220;They can apply as single people and we won&rsquo;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ontario Community and Social Services spokesman Erike Botond said a social assistance benefit may only include one spouse. &#8220;Other adults residing in the same dwelling place as a recipient and their spouse may apply as individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can assure you that polygamy is not recognized under immigration legislation,&#8221; immigration spokesman Karen Shadd-Evelyn said yesterday. &#8220;A conjugal relationship, whether involving marriage or a common-law partnership, must be exclusive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Councillor Rob Ford said taxpayers&rsquo; money should be spent on education and schools instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is wrong,&#8221; Ford said yesterday. &#8220;They should put a stop to this immediately.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Despite the demonstrations and challenges that unseated the Ontario government&rsquo;s plans to legalize sharia law in civil disputes, other elements of backward Islamic culture have evidently slipped in through the back door. And excuse me, Mr. Mumtaz Ali, but the average Canadian is not as liberal-minded as you think. You certainly don&rsquo;t speak for me when you make comments like that. I agree with Councillor Rob Ford - I want a stop to this immediately!</p>

			<p>Let me see now.  In Canada, or UK lite, I could impregnate four women, have one stay home and mind the kids, send the other three off to work, and still collect $6,000 per month from the government. Do the women have to be hairy, ugly, and wear burkas?  (Well if they were hairy and ugly, I guess it&rsquo;s good they wear burkas.)  Or would it be alright if I could convince some hot girls to go along with this?  And all I have to do to get all this is occasionally say, &#8220;My name is Iqbal, and I think Western civilization bites&#8221;  </p>
<p>All kidding aside, this is not the fault of the muslims.  White marxists foist this on their own people.  The so called debate over immigration and welfare and who deserves what is a smoke screen.  There should be no immigration and no welfare.  White marxists are the cancer that is killing the White race and Western civilization.</p>

			<p>The United States needs to take the lead in solving this problem for the western world.  If we are the first nation to abolish socialist programs completely, our economy will surge and other western countries will have a tough time competing.  This will be a STRONG motivator to abolish their own socialist programs.  </p>
<p>Most immigrants don&rsquo;t want to live in the western world.  They are there to exploit weaknesses in our culture.  They want to undercut honest wages by working as slaves.  They want to steal welfare.  And they want to deal drugs.  If you don&rsquo;t let them do any of these things, they&rsquo;d vastly prefer to return home.  They hate us and they hate our countries.</p>

			<p>Why should they get welfare for each of their wives? They&rsquo;re so male dominated, than be a man and support all of your wives. It&rsquo;s wimpy if you don&rsquo;t, right.</p>

			<p>This is a common scam here in the US, a Muslim man will come to the US and marry a citizen so that he can stay here. He will then procede to have 4-5 children with wife #1 and then get a legal divorce so that he can bring his childhood fiancee to the US. He then has 4-5 kids with her and can possibly marry 2 more women and have families with them. Once a woman has been so indoctrinated with Islam she does not mind too much that her husband has other wives so it is common to see American women who share a husband. Each of the wives is technically a single mother so she gets a full complement of welfare, WIC, section 8 and foodstamps so that he does not have to totally support them. Alot of the time the man does not even work and collects some sort of aid as well. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The average recipient with a child can receive about $1,500 monthly, city officials said.&#8221;</p>
<p>I imagine that&rsquo;s their benefits and payments add up to the equivalent of &#8216;$1,500&rsquo;. Who knows tho, maybe they just get it in cash. </p>

			<p>      Islam teaches that a man can have four wives-if he can<br>
support them. Most men can&rsquo;t and so they don&rsquo;t. Under the Wel-<br>
fare State, all Muslim men can afford four wives. The full po-<br>
tential of this has not yet been exploited by them. Yet. It is<br>
a disaster waiting to happen. Any guilt Muslims feel about ex-<br>
ploiting us is put to rest by their teachers: welfare is just<br>
the jiza that dhimmis should be paying anyway. Nice, huh?</p>

			<p>Muslims are good people.  They just like to have a lot of wives and therefore don&rsquo;t have time to work because of the energy expended producing children. Don&rsquo;t forget to &#8220;Pay your Taxes&#8221;.</p>

			<p>One of the reasons Mormons originally espoused polygamy was simply a matter of expediency and survival.  Once it no longer served a legitimate purpose it was discarded.  Muslims will not reject polygamy until it no longer serves a purpose  &mdash;  when they have subdued the world in the name of their false god.</p>

			<p>Will you finally give up mentioning Mormons? The Mormon Church got rid of polygamy in the 1890s. Every Mormon who enters into a polygamous marriage is excommunicated. The splinter groups in Colorady City, etc. are NOT members of the Mormon church.</p>

And what exactly are you doing to stop it? </p>
<p>Have you brought this up in your local mosque? Have you asked your imam to say something against this practice? When you encounter your polygamous, welfare-scamming Muslim &#8220;brothers,&#8221; do you tell them that they are abusing the hospitality of the host nation   &mdash;   not to mention breaking its laws? Do you tell them that by STEALING MONEY from honest taxpaying Canadians, they are making ALL Muslims look bad?</p>
<p>Or do you just go on conservative websites and post comments intended to pacify the (justifiably angry) Infidels? <br>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t just complain. </p>
<p>Use this propaganda, learn how to do it, do it right.</p>
<p>Using the truth is the best propaganda.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions.</p>
<p>In California we have the great propaganda tool of the public initiative &#8220;Proposition #17&hellip;.&#8221; The anti illegal proposition passed. We can do other propositions stating that welfare will only be given to the wife or concubine of one man - polygamy will not be supported by the tax payers and all our pictures, flyers will feature ugly Muslim immigrants. </p>
<p>Propaganda must hit the heart and soul of our people, cause them extreme shots of anger, laughter, love, hate. Our propaganda can not be long, endless discussions of economics, monetary policy that few understand - hear that Ron Paul supporters? Your propaganda is terrible, that&rsquo;s why you got 2% voter support in Florida.</p>
<p>The invading Muslim immigrants - and any, ugly, hateful Third World invaders can be thrown in with the worst Muslims, they can be presented as people ripping off our social welfare system which was designed for the legitimate use of our own people.</p>

			<p>     There&rsquo;s a great book, &#8220;While Europe Slept&#8221; that addreses<br>
this issue. The author met Muslims in Europe who had become<br>
wealthy men using this scam-with houses in both Denmark and<br>
the &#8220;olde country&#8221;. Poor White Sheep, always getting sheared,<br>
lucky if we don&rsquo;t get slaughtered to boot. Well, let&rsquo;s put<br>
down the sheep and put on Manhood. And if that means letting<br>
go of Christianity, so be it. Doesn&rsquo;t it bother you when the<br>
Bible calls you a sheep? <br>

Yes, it does!  The bible tells you to be docile and obedient. Blessed are the meek. Turn the other cheek. <br>
That&rsquo;s not the attitude we need right now.<br>

			<p>I suggest memorizing the phone number of your local immigration scam reporting line, if you have one, and writing it in pen inside every bathroom stall that you can.  Even if only one person sees it, it might give them pause the next time they go to use the comfort station.  Don&rsquo;t give up.  They need to be discouraged from bringing more people into our faltering economy.  I don&rsquo;t buy it for a minute that we need them to pay for social security for our elders.  They are using it up faster than the baby boomers are getting old.  Train OUR children well and stop illegal immigration RIGHT NOW.</p>
