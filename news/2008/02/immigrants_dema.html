						<p>ALBANY &mdash; After a fallout last year over Gov. Eliot Spitzer&rsquo;s failed plan to allow illegal immigrants to obtain drivers&rsquo; licenses, more than 1,000 immigrants rallied on the steps of the Capitol on Monday to demand a new initiative from Spitzer: a $100 million citizenship program to fund education and legal services to help immigrants assimilate more easily.</p>
<p>The crowd was made up of a diverse mix of immigrants &mdash; from Russia, Mexico, Africa, Korea, Haiti and other countries &mdash; that now call the state home.</p>
<p>The $100 million citizenship initiative would fund English-learning classes for children and adults, provide legal assistance to help eligible immigrants through the citizenship application process and protect immigrants from abusive employers and scams, according the coalition.</p>
<p>The citizenship initiative would not only help immigrants achieve citizenship more easily, it would create a more respectful environment statewide for newcomers, said Chung-Wha Hung, executive director of the state&rsquo;s Immigration Coalition.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Currently, 4 million New Yorkers &mdash; 20 percent of the state&rsquo;s population &mdash; is foreign born, with 1.1 million of those currently eligible for citizenship, according to the coalition. Another 400,000 New Yorkers will be up for citizenship in the coming years, according to the coalition.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are more than 200,000 students in the state school system that are trying to learn English, according to the coalition. A Spitzer spokesman said the governor has proposed funding to help immigrants in New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a difficult budget year where the governor closed a $4.6 billion budget gap, the state provides over $176 million in state and federal funding for immigrant support services and has targeted additional funding to immigrant children through education funding formulas,&#8221; said Jeffrey Gordon, spokesman for the state budget division.</p>
<p>Members of the Westchester Hispanic Coalition were among the demonstrators demanding better education for immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jacqueline Garcia, an 18-year-old resident of Rye and student at the College of Mount Saint Vincent, said, &#8220;We are going to be tomorrow&rsquo;s majority.&#8221;</p>

<p>As long as you stay in liberal NY and out of designated White areas like the Pacific Northwest, you can be the majority.</p>
<p>Teach immigrants English ??? Some immigrants can&rsquo;t even speak their native tongues properly, and cannot be taught English due to functional illiteracy.</p>

			<p>The founding fathers had created a republic of such broad freedom for mankind our freedoms openly invalidate the espoused<br>
definitions of every decadent Socialist dictator world wide.<br>
While international socialism and dictators may be appeased that hordes of nonwhites have been released from their burden to act as an adverse force of counteractive political composition <br>
in the United States aided by the willing complacency of the White population the length at which nonwhites seek to critically undermine the republic are limited to the extent of individual moral value against the frame work of the Constitution.<br>

			<p>Oh yes!! The joys of multi-culturalism. And what was that threat from jaqueline garcia, &#8220;we&rsquo;re going to be tomorrows majority.&#8221; She meant to say &#8216;we&rsquo;re going to be tomorrows majority by using your money and stupidity today, white man, and then we&rsquo;re going to totally dispossess you of everything because we&rsquo;ll have no further need of you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Translation: They failed to get the people of New York to kiss their behinds by giving them US identity cards (driver licenses) so they retooled their goal. Now they want money and privilege in the guise of proving they want to be American citizens.</p>
<p>I can assure you that my grandparents weren&rsquo;t marching in the streets demanding taxpayers make them citizens. It&rsquo;s something they understood was their responsibility (and undertaken with pride).</p>
<p>Are these the actions of people we want or even expect to be self-reliant Americans when they come here with demands and their hands outstretched?<br>

			<p>  It is time that the native born citizens of this country start demanding that immigrants are a benefit and not a new debt for the USA.<br>
  Immigrants should pay to learn English out of their own pockets and should not be admited until they can speak and write fluently. <br>
   No legal or fiancial help should be given by the taxpayers for immigrants for any reason. They should pay their own way just like the rest of us are expected to do or go home.<br>
   No translations should be available for anyone except tourists.<br>
   Anyone who thinks that immigrants should have rights, priviledges or benefits which are paid for by citizens is discriminating against US citizens.<br>

			<p>I was listening to the Tavis Smiley show on NPR las Sunday; there was a segment about some African immigrant who was making $29K and raising children. The main thrust of the program was that the poor immigrants were living on the edge with two jobs and that needed to take advantage of GOVERNMENT programs that were availible for them to keep their head above water.</p>
<p>In other words, here was program saying that we are bringing in PARASITES from the Third world that, in the words of an Illinois politician, are &#8220;TAX EATERS.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Suzan it is the public schools, at every level, that make people like Ms.Garcia feel so empowered. In fact,the education establishment and even the business establishment, is  telling the anchor babies and other illegals, in so many different ways,(for example, Spanish required) that the United States is THEIRS lock, stock,and well  &mdash;   TO SERVE THEM AND TO PROVIDE ANYTHING THEY REQUIRE. Jobs, education, housing, cars,etc. Someone however, seemed to leave out the legal taxpayer citizens part in being forced to finance this plan.</p>
