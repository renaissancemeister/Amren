<h1>Subdivisions Built for Blacks Preserved</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Welsh-Huggins, Akron Beacon Journal, February 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) &mdash; Young, working-class and black, Henry Bolden Jr. was not the kind of person who bought a new house in 1946, even in the North. But Bolden was also a U.S. Army veteran who&rsquo;d spent World War II driving supply trucks in Belgium and France. With help from the GI Bill, he was able to buy his house in a Columbus neighborhood that was revolutionary in its day: Hanford Village, an enclave of single-family homes marketed solely to blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the early black homeowner neighborhoods around the country are trying to win historic recognition before their place in the history of homeownership fades.</p>
<p>The residents want to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which would make them eligible for federal tax credits or grants for historic preservation. The designation doesn&rsquo;t protect against demolition but requires anyone involved with a federally funded project, including developers, to take the listing into consideration when the work could endanger the structure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The neighborhoods were developed as the G.I. Bill made home ownership a reality for millions for the first time, including blacks. Cities partnered with the government &mdash; the Veterans Administration or the Federal Housing Authority &mdash; and private developers with a conscience.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another challenge is the relative youth of the housing developments. Eligibility for the National Register begins after 50 years, a timespan that could now make &#8220;historic places&#8221; of split-level ranch subdivisions and shopping plazas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The National Register, a listing of about 80,000 properties, considers the architectural and historic importance of buildings and the shape they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Columbus, the Hanford Village subdivision got its start in 1946 when real estate developer Ivan Gore advertised the first houses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Homes for Negro Families&#8221; read the April 21 ad that year in The Columbus Dispatch. Houses were available for about $6,500, a relative bargain considering the median value of a single-family home at the time was about $8,500.</p>
<p>William Watkins was a Tuskegee Airman who lived in one of the first houses while stationed at nearby Lockborne Air Force Base. Watkins, now 94, remembered how happy he was to have a house as a newly married soldier.</p>
<p>There was gratitude, but something less comfortable too: The segregated houses were a reminder of blacks&rsquo; station in society, even in a northern city.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was always a bitter spot in our hearts because they&rsquo;re building houses all over Columbus and the only houses available for Afro-American vets was this one little Hanford Village,&#8221; Watkins said. &#8220;This is only a drop in the bucket of the number of houses that we actually need.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Children rode their bikes late into the night. They fished, swam and rafted in nearby Alum Creek. Families played and picnicked in the park around the corner.</p>
<p>A mom calling her son home could yell his name from her door and neighbors would repeat it house after house until the message arrived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody knew each other, everybody&rsquo;s parents parented everybody,&#8221; said Carol Haile, whose father, Major Haile, an aircraft mechanic who served in the Pacific in World War II, bought one of the first houses.</p>
<p>The neighborhood began to change in the 1960s when the state routed Interstate 70 through Hanford Village, removing several houses. The highway split the park that a generation of children had grown up in, rendering the remaining few acres almost inaccessible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, Hanford Village is slightly downtrodden, with a mix of renters and homeowners, including a few original residents. Many of the single-story Cape Cod-style cottages are still well kept, looking more or less the same as when they were built. Others are showing signs of neglect; some are even boarded-up.</p>
<p>The Ohio Historical Society considers Hanford Village historically significant and deserving of further study. But it will take a resident to step forward and ask for the process of listing on the National Register to begin.</p>
