<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Future generations may look back on Iraq and immigration as the two great disasters of the Bush presidency. Ironically, for a conservative administration, both of these policy initiatives were rooted in a multicultural view of the world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Extensive data suggest that the champions of progress are the Nordic countries &mdash; Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden &mdash; where, for example, universal literacy was a substantial reality in the 19th century. By contrast, no Arab country today is democratic, and female illiteracy in some Arab countries exceeds 50 percent.</p>
<p>Culture isn&rsquo;t about genes or race; it&rsquo;s about values, beliefs, and attitudes. Culture matters because it influences a society&rsquo;s receptivity to democracy, justice, entrepreneurship, and free-market institutions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A key component of a successful democratic transition is trust, a particularly important cultural factor for social justice and prosperity. Trust in others reduces the cost of economic transactions, and democratic stability depends on it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The high levels of identification and trust in Nordic societies reflect their homogeneity; common Lutheran antecedents, including a rigorous ethical code and heavy emphasis on education; and a consequent sense of the nation as one big family imbued with the golden rule.</p>
<p>Again, culture matters &mdash; race doesn&rsquo;t. The ethnic roots of both Haiti and Barbados lie in the Dahomey region of West Africa. The history of Haiti, independent in 1804 in the wake of a slave uprising against the French colonists, is one of corrupt, incompetent leadership; illiteracy; and poverty. Barbados, which gained its independence from the British in 1966, is today a prosperous democracy of &#8220;Afro-Saxons.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Immigration</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Samuel Huntington was on the mark when he wrote in his latest book &#8220;Who Are We? The Challenges to America&rsquo;s National Identity&#8221;: &#8220;Would America be the America it is today if it had been settled not by British Protestants but by French, Spanish, or Portuguese Catholics? The answer is no. It would not be America; it would be Quebec, Mexico, or Brazil.&#8221;</p>
<p>In &#8220;The Americano Dream,&#8221; Mexican-American Lionel Sosa argues that the value system that has retarded progress in Latin America is an impediment to upward mobility of Latino immigrants. So does former US Rep. Herman Badillo, a Puerto Rican whose book, &#8220;One Nation, One Standard,&#8221; indicts Latino undervaluing of education and calls for cultural change.</p>
<p>The progress of Hispanic immigrants, not to mention harmony in the broader society, depends on their acculturation to mainstream US values. Efforts &mdash; for example, long-term bilingual education &mdash; to perpetuate &#8220;old country&#8221; values in a multicultural salad bowl undermine acculturation to the mainstream and are likely to result in continuing underachievement, poverty, resentment, and divisiveness. So, too, does the willy-nilly emergence of bilingualism in the US. No language in American history has ever before competed with English to the point where one daily hears, on the telephone, &#8220;If you want to speak English, press one; Si quiere hablar en español, oprima el botón número dos.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But immigration looks very different when viewed in cultural terms, particularly with respect to the vast legal and illegal Latino immigration, a million or more people a year, most of them with few skills and little education. To be sure, the US has absorbed large numbers of unskilled and uneducated immigrants in the past, and today the large majority of their descendants are in the cultural mainstream. But the numbers of Latino immigrants and their geographic concentration today leave real doubts about the prospects for acculturation: 70 percent of children in the Los Angeles public schools and 60 percent in the Denver schools are Latino.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Some recommendations</b></p>
<p>If multiculturalism is a myth, how do we avoid the woes that inevitably attend the creation of an enduring and vast underclass alienated from the upwardly mobile cultural mainstream? Some policy implications, one for Latin America, the others for the US and Canada, are apparent.</p>
<p>We must calibrate the flow of immigrants into the US to the needs of the economy, mindful that immigration has adversely affected low-income American citizens, disproportionately African-American and Hispanic, as Barbara Jordan stressed as chair of the 1990s Immigration Reform Commission. But the flow must also be calibrated to the country&rsquo;s capacity to assure acculturation of the immigrants.</p>
<p>We must be a melting pot, not a salad bowl. The melting pot, the essence of which is the Anglo-Protestant cultural tradition, is our way of creating the homogeneity that has contributed so much to the trust and mutual identification &mdash; and progress &mdash; of the Nordic societies.</p>
<p>As with immigration flows of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, an extensive program of activities designed to facilitate acculturation, including mastery of English, should be mounted. A law declaring English to be the national language would be helpful.</p>

					<p>People can talk till their blue in the face about the need for cultural homogeneity, but Anglo-Protestant acculturation has reached it&rsquo;s limit.  America&rsquo;s melting pot has been remarkable for the way it&rsquo;s molded homogeneity within diverse European ethnic groups like Germans, English, Scottish, Norweigan, etc. It met the challenge with Eastern Europeans and catholic groups like Italians and Irish.  It even anglocized Christian Arabs from Lebanon and Syria.  All of these people shared something in common&hellip;..their race.  You cannot have trust and mutual identification with people who are of a different race than the core race, which is Caucasian.      </p>

					<p>Those who insist that culture has nothing to do with race should be asked to provide their theory on how culture originated.  Did a totally disparate group of people mysteriously get together and decide on a common culture?  What nonsense!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always bemused by politicians who declare that immigrants should be &#8220;required&#8221; to learn English.  The cowardly and stupid news media never ask the questions that should be a follow-up to such a declaration:  </p>
<p>Where are all the teachers going to come from to teach English to the immigrants and how much is this going to cost the American taxpayer?</p>
<p>If the immigrant fails to attend English classes, how many absences are allowed before deportation is ordered?</p>
<p>How many chances does the immigrant get to pass an English test and over how long a period of time?</p>
<p>If the immigrant still can&rsquo;t pass an English test after the allowable number of chances, is the immigrant going to be deported along with his (probable) anchor baby children?<br/>

<p>No <span class="caps">CSM</span> I disagree. Alot of the South Americans, and other 3rd worlders coming in here are Race Mixed peoples, who once had White homogenous societies. Egyptians, Indians, South Americans etc.. all once had White Civilizations, but the Whites there ended up one way or another, interbreeding with low IQ non Whites, which destroyed their nation. Now they &#8220;immigrate&#8221; here. However, after we have been destroyed by interbreeding with the low <span class="caps">IQ&rsquo;</span>s there will be no more civilization.</p>
<p>How do they expect interbreeding and &#8220;integration&#8221; to solve this problem when non whites outproduce Whites and everyone else as well ? </p>

					<p>I used to buy the neoconservative theory that separates culture from race. It is true that individuals of alien races can acculturate to another&rsquo;s race&rsquo;s norms. It is not true that great numbers or whole populations of an alien race can acculturate. They will just recreate their own native culture in the territory of the host culture. Hispanics have more than twenty countries in Central and South America to practice their culture. The United States and, inevitably, Canada are under no obligation to add themselves to that list.</p>

Although it&rsquo;s refreshing in the postmodern multiculti mess that is modern America to hear somebody endorse the old melting-pot paradigm   &mdash;   and an &#8220;Anglo-Protestant&#8221; melting pot at that   &mdash;   this writer still suffers from the universalist delusions of the unreconstructed liberal. He still thinks hispanics, like Salinger&rsquo;s &#8220;underachieving&#8221; Holden Caulfield, &#8220;just need to start <span class="caps">APPLYING </span>themselves,&#8221; and they will finally fulfill their amazing potential and dazzle us all. That Juan and Juanita will join the middle class and magically transform into salsa-dancing Ward and June Cleavers. </p>
<p>&#8220;US Rep. Herman Badillo, a Puerto Rican&hellip; indicts Latino undervaluing of education and calls for cultural change.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve previously pointed out here on various occasions and in various ways, the only people who &#8220;undervalue education&#8221; are people <span class="caps">WHO ARE</span> NO <span class="caps">GOOD</span> AT <span class="caps">IT.</span> Education is not important to latinos because latinos aren&rsquo;t (to put it charitably) intellectually inclined. Smartness only matters to those with some smarts. If you aren&rsquo;t smart yourself, the smartness of others appears, at best, a frivolous waste of time; and, at worst, an annoyance or even a <span class="caps">THREAT. </span></p>
<p>The &#8220;cultural change&#8221; that Senor Badillo and this Christian Science Monitor writer are calling for is, therefore, simply not in the cards. Ain&rsquo;t gonna happen. Like trying to teach a cat to bark. Rotsa ruck. </p>
<p>The <span class="caps">CSM </span>tries to convince us that &#8220;culture matters, race doesn&rsquo;t.&#8221; But what is any culture but the manifestation of that culture&rsquo;s millions of members? Which is to say, the outward expression of its <span class="caps">RACE</span>? Whites and Asians (when not hamstrung by communism) produce consistently prosperous and desirable cultures and nations. Mestizos consistently produce cultures of corruption and poverty. And blacks consistently produce cultures of <span class="caps">EVEN WORSE </span>corruption and poverty. What any country &#8220;is like&#8221; is decided by the various abilities and inabilities, strengths and weakness, of that country&rsquo;s inhabitants. <span class="caps">RACE</span> IS <span class="caps">NOT</span> A <span class="caps">SOCIAL CONSTRUCT </span>  &mdash;   <span class="caps">SOCIETY</span> IS A <span class="caps">RACIAL CONSTRUCT. </span></p>
<p>So   &mdash;   like the Christian Science Monitor itself   &mdash;   this writer is half-right. The half that&rsquo;s right is the Science. The half that&rsquo;s wrong is the Christian. <br/>

					<p>&ldquo;Would America be the America it is today if it had been settled not by British Protestants but by French, Spanish, or Portuguese Catholics? The answer is no. It would not be America; it would be Quebec, Mexico, or Brazil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kinda, sorta. I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s trying to imply here, but he&rsquo;s seeming to suggest that European Catholics cannot make a civilization run as well as European Protestants. But he seems to forget the racial aspect.</p>
<p>America was 90% white until the transformation which began in the 1960s. Mexico is no more than 10% white.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Quebec is First World, and until recently, nearly all-white. Southern Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay are also nearly all-white (80-90%), and the richest parts of Latin America. Although, granted, the South American areas have their own quirks due to the dominant Southern European culture.</p>
<p>I wonder what America would be like if Britain had never gone Protestant? Unfortunately, we shall never know.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Trust&#8221; is a genetic trait and genetics are racial.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust&#8221; was strained out/in the genetic code during the hideous Ice Ages where Nordic whites <span class="caps">HAD </span>to trust each other or die. No other race had to go through this brutal Holocaust thus no other race has this altruism/trust gene like the whites.</p>

					<p>I commend Lawrence Harrison for having the courage to write such an article, which suggests that some cultures are actually better than others.  I hope that he does not get fired for this!   He does a good job in many respects.  However he gets some things wrong.  </p>
<p>First, he says that culture isn&rsquo;t about genes or race.  That is untrue.  Culture is an extension of race.  This is because culture is determined by behavior and intelligence, and these are partially determined by genes and race.  For example, anyone who works with dogs, cats, and cattle knows that different breeds are extremely different in behavior, temperament, and intelligence.  These strong differences have appeared after less than 10,000 years of domestication.  </p>
<p>It is no wonder that human races, which have been separate for much, much longer, have likewise diverged in behavior and intelligence.  In fact, if that were not true (i.e., if all races were exactly alike in behavior and intelligence), it would be one of the most amazing findings in science, and one that could not be explained by any known process.  How could different population (races), living thousands of miles apart, and with no interbreeding all stay exactly the same?  It would be impossible, an hence, each race shows distinct physical, physiological, intelligence, and behavioral characteristics.  (Continues below)<br/>
</p>

					<p>(Continues from above)</p>
<p>Overwhelming scientific research shows that Jewish, East Asian, and European races have high intelligence and that Aborigine, pigmy, African and Amer-Indian races have low intelligence.  There is also strong data showing physiological/endocrine differences as well, and these differences translate into behavioral differences, such as impulsiveness, risk taking, sexual activity, altruism, physical activity levels, social deviancy, etc.  </p>
<p>The bottom line is that it is virtually impossible for Aborigines and Black African races to create or maintain a modern, stable, wealthy, technological society – Not a single African nation has accomplished this, and in fact, as soon as Europeans leave, African infrastructure and society reverts back to a more primitive and brutal form.  The same happens when Africans become a majority in any city outside of Africa (E. St. Louis, Detroit, Washington, <span class="caps">D.C.,</span> New Orleans, etc.).  </p>
<p>It is true that European culture can lift both low- and high-IQ races.  An example is China, which had an extremely low standard of living 30 years ago, but has rapidly reversed that by adopting a different culture (Capitalism).  However, again, adopting a European culture will only take low-IQ races so far, and requires constant input (Barbados).</p>
<p>In the <span class="caps">USA,</span> Billions of Dollars of social programs can slightly improve the performance of low-IQ races.  But, these programs cannot alter the genes, and so will need to be repeated again and again, each generation.  Hence, there is a continual drain on society.  A better method is to form nations from high-IQ races, which solves the problem.  <br/>

					<p>Well done, Mr. Harrison.<br/>
The real problem is the willingness of non-Americans regarding assimilation and/or acculturation. Mr. Harrison commented on this when he spoke of immigrant&rsquo;s proclivities of perpetuating &ldquo;old country&rdquo; values while participating in America. It would be difficult to achieve real success with the embracing of Anglo-Protestant values while at the same time retaining elements of an alien culture. If one&rsquo;s alien culture were superior, then why immigrate to an inferior clime? It appears one is faced with an &#8216;all or nothing&rsquo; effect when choosing to assimilate. That is why the real problem here is a formidable resistance within the human mind to change. The successful immigrant in America is the one that America should forever welcome: the willing immigrant (ie-willing to change one&rsquo;s culture to that of a more successful one ;).<br/><br/>

<p>Actually, to the extent that race ultimately determines one&rsquo;s values, beliefs and attitudes, this premise is half correct. Genes determines one&rsquo;s race, and race determines one&rsquo;s values, beliefs, and attitudes, which result in being  expressed by the culture.</p>
<p>Anyone with even rudimentary knowledge of Biblical principles is aware that a people who is unable or unwilling to be fruitful and to multiply is disposed from their land. That is no different for  the White nations of today than it was for the ancient Hebrew people of olden times. .</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for purposes of division to enable their rule, (or to soothe their guilty consciences) our &#8220;leaders&#8221; seem to view themselves as God&rsquo;s avenging Angels whose purpose is to right the wrongs of their perceived view of historical injustice by subjugating Whites to &#8220;Black&#8221; rule. This is basic Marxist theory with the clever post 60&rsquo;s substitution of race for class.<br/>
 <br/><br/>
Never were the oppressed so oppressed than when the oppressed become the oppressors. thus, if the current dispossession of Whites succeeds, the Marxist dream of history as being one of eternal revolution and bloody social conflict and perpetual upheavals will be validated. </p>
<p>Perhaps our rulers should actually read their Bibles rather than taking a few of the red letter passages out of context. </p>

<p>No&hellip;.culture is about race.</p>
<p>At the very core of our problems caused by multiculturalism and liberalism is this misunderstanding.  Culture, values, beliefs and attitudes&hellip;..these things flow from our genes.  From our <span class="caps">RACE. </span> Not as individuals but as societies.  Most members of a society hold to these values and it&rsquo;s enduring over generations.  Individuals may differ, but for the most part, most people of a race are homogenous.</p>

					<p>Race does matter!!!! It is the race that creates the culture, not the culture that creates the race!!!! This is nothing more than neo-con drivel that wishes to spend more time, money, and effort(not to mention throwing your white daughter into the mix) in an attempt to nordicize non-whites. When will these people ever get it? The non-whites don&rsquo;t want to be nordicized and we true whites don&rsquo;t want them here in the first place. </p>

					<p>&#8220;Again, culture matters &mdash; race doesn&rsquo;t. The ethnic roots of both Haiti and Barbados lie in the Dahomey region of West Africa. The history of Haiti, independent in 1804 in the wake of a slave uprising against the French colonists, is one of corrupt, incompetent leadership; illiteracy; and poverty. Barbados, which gained its independence from the British in 1966, is today a prosperous democracy of &ldquo;Afro-Saxons.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>All this proves is that culture matters.  It doesn&rsquo;t prove that race doesn&rsquo;t matter.  As a matter of fact, as we all know, race matters a great deal.  Aside from that we should look at developing countries as developing children.  Studies show that black children are quite receptive to positive cultural stimuli - until their genes kick in around puberty.  Countries often behave the same way.  We don&rsquo;t know yet what kind of a country Barbados will be long term.  A few months ago, many people looked up to Kenya as an African success story.  Then their genes kicked in.</p>

					<p>&#8220;The high levels of identification and trust in Nordic societies reflect their homogeneity; common Lutheran antecedents, including a rigorous ethical code and heavy emphasis on education; and a consequent sense of the nation as one big family imbued with the golden rule.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, all this used to be true. Finnish schoolchildren are on the top in the <span class="caps">OECD&rsquo;</span>s international assessment of student performance, and that is chiefly because of the homogeneity of our population. But even we Finns are not the same Finns anymore that fought Soviets in the Winter War. The cultural Left has done its deadly work here. And if so far Finland has avoided the immigration mess of Sweden and Norway, leftist and liberal politicians among us are determined to change that in near future.</p>

					<p>How many times does he say, &#8220;Culture isn&rsquo;t about genes or race; it&rsquo;s about values, beliefs, and attitudes.&#8221;?<br/>
This entire article was pointless as it was conceding the counter-point to the argument even while it was making it.<br/><br/>

The history of Haiti, independent in 1804 in the wake of a slave uprising against the French colonists, is one of corrupt, incompetent leadership; illiteracy; and poverty. Barbados, which gained its independence from the British in 1966, is today a prosperous democracy of &ldquo;Afro-Saxons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1. Right off the bat he identifies the #1 cause of difference. Barbados has been under black/mulatto rule for just 40 years, whereas Haiti has been under complete black &#8220;rule&#8221; for 200+ years.</p>
<p>2. He also fails to note that Barbados is <span class="caps">STILL </span>part of the British Commonwealth <span class="caps">AND </span>around 10% of its population are White.</p>
<p>3. He also fails to note that Barbados has a population of just 279,000 compared to Haiti&rsquo;s nearly 9 million.</p>
<p>4. When scaled for comparison, Barbados and Haiti show much in common culturally. <br/>
Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s comparison is thus easily destroyed.</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;Extensive data suggest that the champions of progress are the Nordic countries &mdash; Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden..&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
And those countries are now being terrorized by their booming immigrant populations on a daily basis.</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;The high levels of identification and trust in Nordic societies reflect their homogeneity;&#8221;</p>

It seems to not occur to people that the original colonists of America were not that diverse. They were all White, Protestant, spoke languages from the same language branch (English, German, Dutch and Scots, all part of the Germanic sub group of languages) and all came from the same Northern European cultural/genetic background.</p>
<p>That, is why America succeeded&hellip;</p>

<p>Here they go again, basing decisions on money   &mdash;   greed!   Immigration influences hundreds of aspects of our lives, including population levels, urban sprawl, higher taxes for social programs, ethnic conflict, crime levels, etc. just to name a few.   Yet, the only thing they talk about is &#8220;the economy.&#8221; And even that is a lie, because, yes, some business owners can get rich by replacing high-paid <span class="caps">USA</span> Citizens by low-paid immigrants, but the rest of us are stuck with paying for their education, food stamps, medical care, policing, and other social support programs, and also paying for the care of the unemployed Citizens that have been replaced.  </p>

					<p>Something that I think you should think about:  It is the &#8220;white&#8221; British Anglos that brought slavery and then would not let go of it until the Civil War.  So, therefore, in my humble opinion, the British and other Anglos are mainly to blame for the pickle we are in, in America.  Most American blacks were brought to this country involuntarily.  Therefore, they became our responsiblity.  Also, without immigration, our country would not have been as great as it became.  The poor, uneducated, Irish, Italians and Polish contributed greatly to the prosperity of <span class="caps">USA. </span> And remember that many Anglos did not consider Italians to be &#8220;white&#8221; or pure as they considered themselves.  Now of course they are fine.  To me the easy and wide distribution of welfare and other giveaway programs are the biggest cause of our problems.  The early immigrants did not get them nor did they expect it.  Now the giveaway programs are not only commonplace, they are felt to be deserved by the many groups.  With many blacks and hispanics (and some others) this attitude is passed on from generation to generation.  Get rid of welfare and giveaways (for the most part) and society will improve in my opinion.  The work ethic which made our country great can be revived, and the able-bodied who don&rsquo;t want to work will return to their country of origin, because they will not be able to live off the fat of the land.      </p>

					<p>Another absurd distortion of reality spawned by the Christian Science Monitor.</p>
<p>That <span class="caps">CRIME </span>escalates in White countries in direct proportion to influx of non-White immigrants has been sufficiently well established. Amply demonstrated by recent history to be denied.</p>
<p>Although far from blameless, the only non-White immigrants to White countries posing minimal social problems and bringing minimal crime, greed for welfare handouts are Chinese or Japanese. As to the darker-skinned races   &mdash;   <span class="caps">HISTORY, </span>as pointed out, speaks for <span class="caps">REALITY</span>!</p>
<p>Witness the crimes so noticeable in today&rsquo;s Europe   &mdash;   the perps? African and other non-White immigrants. Whether adhering to the Muslim faith or not being relevant. Non-Whites claiming to be shut out of the job opportunities, denied economic growth   &mdash;   <span class="caps">NOT </span>because of their race   &mdash;   but because they simply are unfit for desired vocations! Due to lack of education, lack of job skills, even lack of minimal language skill.</p>
<p>Maybe Lawrence Harrison might care to rewrite this story,  also do a bit more research   &mdash;   then focus on the <span class="caps">REAL REASONS </span>non-White immigrants are not exactly welcomed with open arms. Culture, values, attitudes   &mdash;   simply get undermined and destroyed by the third-world trash flooding into White countries.</p>
<p>Has anyone watched that utterly silly &#8220;6 Degrees Could Change the World&#8221; TV program aired on the History Channel? If so, have you noted how adroitly the script writers sidestepped the <span class="caps">REAL CAUSE </span>behind the claim of man-made global warming? <span class="caps">POPULATION EXPLOSION </span>  &mdash;   in the third-world countries being the unadmitted culprit!</p>
<p>Just take the United States as an example: our population in the 1950s was roughly 180 million. Quality of life was excellent. Crime, even by Blacks, not that high. Today&rsquo;s population in excess of 300 <span class="caps">MILLION </span>  &mdash;   including 40 million Hispanics, not forgetting, of cuss, their anchor babies and <span class="caps">THEIR </span>anchor babies&rsquo; anchor babies.</p>
<p>Traffic problems   &mdash;   horrendous. Pollution   &mdash;   out of control. Crime   &mdash;   skyrocketing. Quality of life   &mdash;   dropping steadily. Now extend extend that to the entire planet. The abysmally ignorant African farmers   &mdash;   destroying what arable land they have by refusing to change their agricultural techniques. Also Leming-like outbreeding their available food production capabilities. People in South and Central America   &mdash;   destroying the rain forests to obtain cropland for their exploding populations. India, Pakistan, China   &mdash;   <span class="caps">DITTO</span>!</p>
<p>Wonder how the joys and benefits of multi-culturalism could be applied to solve the problems facing our grossly overpopulated planet? Letting third-world trash flood into White nations is hardly going to <span class="caps">SOLVE </span>any problems from what I can see.</p>

					<p> I went to the library and got a book on slavery and it said the Arabs started the slavery that led to americans having slavery. There were other groups before it got to the British. In fact they were last in a long line of groups. Look it up. Blacks would convert to moslem religion and then the Arabs wouldn,t enslave them if they converted (interesting fact). There were also about a half million free blacks at the start of the civil war.  60 minutes just had a show where people in Norway are the happiest in the world. Wouldn,t it make sense to mirror the society that has the happiest people. Our so called leaders started this multicultural snowball down the hill and you can see what you,re going to end up with is a big dirty snowball. Hope they,re happy but them and their children probably won,t be here either. Also my final thought is that they still have slavery in this world</p>

Posted by at 9:36 AM on February 27</p>
<p><br/>
First off, Anglo refers to the ethnic English only. Calling all White people &#8216;Anglo&rsquo;s&rsquo; is like calling all Asians &#8216;Koreans&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Secondly, America was created by, for and in the image of, the British (Anglo-Saxons in particular), as America was a British colony.</p>
<p>Third, &#8220;Anglos&#8221; were not the main supplier of slaves to the New World (where only about 4% of African slaves were brought to America, the other 96% to Latin America). And at that, only a very small percentage of the ruling elite kept slaves to work on their mega-plantations. The most significant and the hardest work in building and sustaining America was done by Whites and Whites alone. It was they who cleared the forests, fought the indians, built the towns, constructed Government and courts of law, and settled and civilized what before had been a barren wasteland of savagery. </p>
<p>Fourth, the early immigrants to America were fellow Germanic peoples related to the English such as the Germans, Dutch, Swedes and Scotch-Irish.<br/>
Other groups came later, but as was said during the 1924 immigration debate,</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;What we do claim is that the northern European, and particularly Anglo-Saxons made this country. Oh, yes; the others helped. But that is the full statement of the case. They came to this country because it was already made as an Anglo-Saxon commonwealth. They added to it, they often enriched it, but they did not make it, and they have not yet greatly changed it. We are determined that they shall not.&#8221; (Congressional Record, 4/8/1924, 5922)</p>
