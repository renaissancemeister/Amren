						<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The city of San Francisco will pay $1.6 million to 12 police officers who claimed they were passed over for promotions because of reverse discrimination.</p>
<p>The Board of Supervisors approved the payment Tuesday after a settlement was reached in federal court two years ago.</p>
<p>The officers accused the Police Department of illegally favoring five black candidates for promotions to lieutenant.</p>

			<p>The San Francisco police unit that investigates homicides has one of the lowest success rates of any major city in the nation.Is it any coincidence that promotions to that unit are based on affirmative action and racial quotas, and not competence or good performance?Lou Calabro, the former head of EAIF and a retired poliece leutenant was a victim or this practice.</p>

			<p>Excellent!! This is one way to end DISCRIMINATION (not &#8220;reverse discrimination&#8221;) against whites. We should file lawsuits each and every time something of this nature happens, which is quite often. Eventually this nonsense would stop. </p>
<p>Even so, this isnt enough. So we take white taxpayer dollars and pay whites who were wronged. But what about those who are responsible? My guess is they still have their (affirmative action?) jobs. Why are these people not held responsible? Why are they not fired, lose pensions, etc? </p>

			<p>When are they going to start calling it what it is? &#8220;Racism&#8221;. The expression &#8220;reverse discrimination&#8221; is, in itself, racist against whites.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s that word again;  &#8220;REVERSE&#8221; discrimination.  Implying that it&rsquo;s some sort of strange phenomena when whites are discriminated against by the system.  We all know that this sort of thing has been happening for decades, disguised as affirmative action and political correctness.  Thankfully, a few of us are finally awakening to these unconstitutional practices and have begun to challenge these marxist, anti-white policies.</p>
<p>One thing that I have noticed, however, is that many of these cases are reached by &#8220;settlement&#8221;.  Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, but settlements do not carry the same weight as a court decision.  When it comes to challenging the constitutionality of certain policies (as in government sponsored discrimination), a settlement prevents the use of that case as legal precedent in future lawsuits, and stops the case from possibly working its way up to the Supreme Court.  In other words, since a settlement was reached instead of a court decision rendered, the government entity can continue with their disciminatory practices and simply write off these lawsuits as a cost of doing business.  Can any of our legal experts comment on this?  Am I wrong in my analysis? </p>

			<p>Why do they keep calling it &#8220;reverse discrimination&#8221; when there&rsquo;s nothing reverse about it at all   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s just plain old racial discrimination.  Which a great many blacks engage in any time they are in a position to do so, from Thurgood Marshall on down.<br/>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.  This lawsuit did not challenge the constitutionality of the SFPD&rsquo;s affirmative action programs, it simply sought damages for a Federal civil tort.  But even if the issue was Constitutionality, and the Federal courts would have found against the SFPD, this does not necessarily mean that the SFPD will comply and get rid of affirmative action.  For that to happen, the Federal courts have to put SFPD under a &#8220;consent decree,&#8221; that is, a constant state of judicial monitoring and supervision.  The Federal courts did it all the time back in the 1970s when they felt like desegregating schools by force.</p>

			<p>Note the politically correct lable in the report:  &#8220;reverse&#8221; discrimination. </p>
<p>Discrimination is discrimination.  The PC reference implies that only whites are capable of racial discrimination.</p>
<p>When will news reporters get honest? When will they grow up?  </p>

			<p>&#8220;The city has said race was not a factor in the promotions, and did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>HA!  Yes, race was not a factor, but they decided to pay out the punitive damages anyway, because they&rsquo;re such humanitarians.</p>
<p>If there is a single city that is most apt to be sunk into perdition for being bizarre and crazy it is this one.  </p>

			<p>This discrimination is happening all over the country, and most Whites just accept that they are sacrificial lambs on the altar of political correctness.<br/>
A few have testicular fortitude, and fight back.</p>

			<p>We need to take a leaf out of these guys&rsquo; books.  If you&rsquo;ve been discriminated against because of being white, then go to court!</p>
<p>Guys, don&rsquo;t get pessimistic about this whole racial affair.  I&rsquo;m starting to get tired of hearing, &#8220;Whites have no balls, the country is doomed, etc.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Congrats are in order to those White police officers in passing that major hurdle in today&rsquo;s oppressive p.c. climate.</p>
<p>In Canada, I&rsquo;ve never heard of any similar lawsuit challenging government policies designed to discriminate against our own white people, but we&rsquo;re certainly aware of the same unfair hiring and promotional practices occurring in this country as explained in this letter. </p>
<p>http://www.vdare.com/letters/tl_121107.htm</p>
<p>It should be noted that the White majority is still <b>86%</b> while Blacks, mostly immigrants, represent a subset of a mere <b>2%</b> of our population. </p>
<p>However, judging by our mass media advertising blitz giving a false image, you would mistakenly think they occupied the 30th percentile range.</p>

			<p>Its not &#8220;reverse&#8221; anything. It&rsquo;s discrimination against whites, and illegal and unconstitutional.<br/>
There&rsquo;s too much of this. There is a political movement happening that has as it&rsquo;s goals the elimination of Whites.</p>

Very interesting case. I hope AmRen will stay on this story, because I too would like to know if the white officers will ever see these settlement monies actually show up in their bank accounts. </p>
<p>To Cop:  I&rsquo;m no law-talkin&rsquo; guy, but your analysis sounds correct to me   &mdash;   ditto St. Louis CofCC. It probably would have carried more weight had it been a court decision rather than a settlement. But considering how the forces of PC have the deck stacked against us these days, even a settlement is cause for celebration. Hey, at least the court didn&rsquo;t order these good men of the SFPD into Remedial Diversity Training for having been so vulgar as to bring the subject up. In the Bizarro World that is 2008 America, that alone counts as a big victory for our side. </p>
<p>Maybe NEXT time someone can challenge the constitutionality of affirmative action programs   &mdash;   with the long-term goal of doing away with them. <br/>
