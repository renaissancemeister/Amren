						<p>Prominently displayed in a glass case outside the Service High School library is a statement typed in big, bold letters:</p>
<p>&#8220;The best way to hide something from black people is to put it in a book.&#8221;</p>
<p>A group of black students who call themselves Beautiful Colors put it up to spark conversation in a high school that has seen its student population go from predominantly white to nearly half minority within the past decade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is stirring up passions about blacks failing in school and raising questions among black kids about where provocation for thought ends and racism begins. Parents have called the school. Teachers have set aside class time to talk about it. And principal Lou Pondolfino called a special public meeting to discuss it.</p>
<p>Senior Alexander Shaw is surprised at the reaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to challenge people to break the mold and evoke change,&#8221; said the self-described Filipino, Puerto Rican and black 18-year-old, who, with the group, put it up as part of a Black History Month display. Somebody showed him the quote from the Internet. It has variously been attributed to white supremacists, black activists and comedians.</p>
<p>Shaw defends the statement by pointing to the statistics: Last year, while blacks made up the smallest minority group at Service, they had the highest dropout rate of any ethnic group, nearly double the average, according to the school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some white kids, black kids, other minorities and their parents want the words taken down though.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> &#8220;The statement is racist and propagating stereotypes,&#8221; said parent Nicole Howell at the gathering of 50 people in the school&rsquo;s library on Friday.</p>
<p>Reyonna Sudduth, who is part of Beautiful Colors, said she&rsquo;s glad the display has caused a commotion. She wants black kids to be motivated to prove the statement incorrect.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Service High School sits in the mostly Caucasian and well-to-do Hillside neighborhoods in South Anchorage. It used to be largely a white school until South Anchorage High School was built nearby and the public school boundaries were redrawn, bringing in more racially and economically diverse students from East Anchorage neighborhoods. Now the school is 45 percent minority, according to last year&rsquo;s numbers.</p>

<p>This statement is so true. I wish I could fit my car and my little sister&rsquo;s chastity in a book. Then I would feel much more comfortable living in an predominately black area.</p>

					<p>The telling, honest line in the article says it all:  <br>
&#8220;&hellip;.it&rsquo;s cool to be dumb&hellip;&#8221; in regard to the black community.<br><br>
Other blacks call getting educated, &#8220;acting white&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The reality is that aside from this amazingly stupid and adolescent mindset, blacks don&rsquo;t really have to graduate, achieve or work to get ahead.  With main stream media support, politicians will make room for them in jobs via affirmative action. It will make new entitlement laws that will provide for their families from cradle to grave, and blacks know a new entitlement is but a cry of &#8220;racism&#8221; away.  If they really must, they&rsquo;ll have a march to make demands on the &#8220;racist&#8221; system the &#8220;keeps em&rsquo; down&#8221;. </p>
<p>They have the time for marches, by the way.   </p>
<p>You could ask, &#8220;why should blacks try?&#8221;, but more to the point, who are the truly &#8220;dumb&#8221; people in this scenario? Don&rsquo;t say &#8220;white politicians&#8221;, folks.  It&rsquo;s the people who voted them in office.    </p>

<p>Trouble is, black &#8220;kids&#8221; don&rsquo;t <span class="caps">WANT </span>to learn, so the statement is correct, even though you want it to be so, it doesn&rsquo;t make it so. Blacks are so enamored with &#8220;bling&#8221; and &#8220;pimpin&#8221; they could care less about learning anything in school. Like the saying goes, you can lead a horse to water but you can&rsquo;t make it drink. Blacks don&rsquo;t care to &#8220;drink&#8221; from the fountain of knowledge, that&rsquo;s just facts.  Not racist, just facts. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s that puzzling phrase again: &#8220;racially and economically diverse&#8221;. It implies that nothing white or successful is good enough until it is not white or successful anymore. Once &#8220;diversity&#8221; is enforced and the prosperity disappears, everyone is mystified as to why this happened, and are quick to blame the whites for being white. If they&rsquo;d been black or brown there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any pesky race problem.</p>

					<p>I applaud the group of black students who put up the banner.  Unfortunately for them they are about to learn what Justice Clarence Thomas knows so well.  Challenge the black orthodoxy and you will be vilified.  First, the liberals will find some way to blame Whites for the sign, and claim it is a racist affront to black &#8220;dignity&#8221;.  Then everyone will have to be sent to sensitivity training, where Whites will be taught, or rather threatened, to hold their tongues, and blacks will be taught that illiteracy, promiscuity, and other uncivilized behaviors are their &#8220;culture&#8221;, and White people are in league with the devil and responsible for everything that goes wrong in the world.</p>

					<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t the only ones who don&rsquo;t read. The sorry truth is that whites are almost as bad.</p>
<p>According to a report that came out recently, &#8220;one in four Americans read no books last year.&#8221; Forty-two percent of college graduates never read another book after they get out of college. A third of high school graduates never read another book for the rest of their lives. 44 million Americans are &#8220;functionally illiterate.&#8221; 21 million can&rsquo;t read or write at all. A fifth of high school graduates can&rsquo;t read their diplomas.</p>
<p>These numbers probably reflect our growing &#8220;diversity&#8221; to a certain extent, maybe a large extent, but most of the whites I know  &mdash;  the majority of them, in fact  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t read anything and the rest of them read primarily for escape, and they don&rsquo;t do much of that, either. When I go to visit people, they usually have tons of <span class="caps">DVD&rsquo;</span>s and <span class="caps">CD&rsquo;</span>s lying around, but if they have any books at all, they&rsquo;re usually a small, rag-tag collection of old textbooks and stuff left over from college or high school. And they probably never read any of them in the first place.</p>
<p>Considering the state of our high schools and colleges, a graduate who never reads anything after he gets out of school basically has no education at all. Americans in general don&rsquo;t seem to value education except as a necessary hurdle to get into the working world. They&rsquo;re not interested. Most of the people I know, including everyone in my family, have no intellectual curiosity about the world around them. None. They just don&rsquo;t care. I was going to say that they&rsquo;re perfectly content to have reality explained to them by the nightly news, but the truth is that they don&rsquo;t even care about that. They&rsquo;re not paying attention. There&rsquo;s an insidious mental dullness at work here  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t really know how to describe it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given up talking to these people about anything. Forget about trying to explain something like white nationalism to them. They won&rsquo;t even hear your arguments. Most of them will just stare at you blankly. A lot of them will react with something like pure fear to the merest hint of &#8220;racism&#8221; or anything that questions the perceived wisdom of the herd. You can&rsquo;t talk about alternate views of history to people who get all their history from movies and can&rsquo;t even remember most of that. </p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about white nationalists in general is that they&rsquo;re big readers. They read everything. They read all sorts of books  &mdash;  lots of history, lots of obscure stuff that was written before 1960 when the rot started to take hold for real. They&rsquo;re <span class="caps">INTERESTED </span>in the world and that makes all the difference. It&rsquo;s impossible to understand what&rsquo;s going on today if you don&rsquo;t do a lot of reading on your own and that requires intellectual curiosity. You can&rsquo;t move beyond the orthodox view of history if you don&rsquo;t even know what it is. I&rsquo;m extremely pessimistic about the chances of &#8220;waking people up,&#8221; especially through information campaigns and the like which require reading and thought and which assume a certain degree of education which no longer exists.</p>
<p>A friend of mine teaches remedial reading to black college students. He says most of them can read all right. They&rsquo;re just not interested. Reading is a white thing, supposedly, but how can it be a white thing when most whites don&rsquo;t read either? They used to, though. The problem isn&rsquo;t that they don&rsquo;t read as such. It&rsquo;s that they just don&rsquo;t care anymore. They&rsquo;re lost their interest. They&rsquo;ve been anesthetized.</p>
<p>The majority of whites have been put to sleep.</p>

					<p>What a well-researched article, typical of what is seen from the abhorrently liberal press  &mdash;  not!  The quote can actually be attributed to Chris Rock from his <span class="caps">HBO </span>special which was filmed in <span class="caps">D.C., </span>circa 1998-99.</p>

&#8220;It has variously been attributed to white supremacists, black activists and comedians.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Specifically the comedian Chris Rock, a very funny and insightful <span class="caps">BLACK </span>standup comic. Rock&rsquo;s version is actually &#8220;worse,&#8221; in that he uses the N-word, and adds the stinger, &#8220;Books are like Kryptonite to [N-words]!&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful to Chris Rock that he makes these critiques of his own people   &mdash;   because it&rsquo;s pretty clear that whites are no longer allowed to say <span class="caps">ANYTHING ABOUT ANYBODY. </span><br>

					<p>Except for Native Americans, I didn&rsquo;t think there were enough minorities in Alaska to fill one classroom let alone almost half a school.  I can cross out Alaska as a possible safehaven once the lower 48 self-implode.  I&rsquo;m left with only Iceland, Greenland, both Poles, and the Yukon Territories on my list.<br>

					<p>This is a cruel comment to make to blacks that feeds them a horrible lie.  Blacks don&rsquo;t engage in scholarship for unchangeable genetic reasons.  Low IQ not lack of effort is the main cause of black failure.  To imply that their own willful ignorance allows others to take advantage of them is degrading to them and insulting to whites, who have gone to great lengths to uplift the black race for several generations now.</p>
<p>No one is hiding anything from them in books.  And, if they were, it really isn&rsquo;t blacks fault that they aren&rsquo;t literate enough to catch on.</p>
<p>Most blacks will never be able to do anything except push a broom for a living.  That is an uncomfortable truth but there is no shame in it.  There is much blacks have to be ashamed of, their crime, their racism, how they have allowed their families to disintegrate.  But their lack of intelligence is not one of these.</p>

<p>It looks like segregation is progressing in Alaska pretty much the same as it is in the rest of the country. In another 10 years, the only thing white about this school will be the snow outside. The moralizing, holier-than-thou, whitey-is-evil anti-segregationists may have won the battles, but ultimately they are going to  lose the war.</p>

					<p>If it is true that black africans made this sign then posted it, then surely those are two improvements to the usual standards, especially if others could actually read and understand it. I bet the sign will be removed and declared illegal, same way as nooses, although in that instance, the poor tree was cut down in case it caused any further offence to the intellectuals involved.</p>

<p>Not as long as white politicians insist on creating welfare programs. I am convinced that when welfare disappears, diversity will follow right along with it. The next great economic disaster is what will bury diversity forever.</p>

					<p>If you want to see something funny that is brutally honest about blacks watch &#8220;The Boondocks&#8221;. It is an animated series created by a black man named Aaron McGruder. In one episode uncle Ruckus ( a black man who hates blacks) is trying to excorcise the evil spirit of a black man out of another black man with white tendencies. His bag is filled with things that &#8220;terrify every black man&#8221;. A bullwhip, a branding iron, a police baton and a job application. At one point he puts a book in front of the posessed man imploring him to read which sends him into convulsions. Its hysterical!! The show bags on everything from gay rappers, black culture and something they refer to as &#8220;a n****r moment&#8221; which can be one black bumping into another,forcing a fight to the death for this &#8220;disrespect&#8221;.</p>

					<p>Low IQ not lack of effort is the main cause of black failure.</p>
<p>I agree with the low IQ part, but I have to disagree about the effort.  It see no effort, not one bit from blacks when it comes to academics or improving themselves.  You don&rsquo;t need to have a Phd to live a productive, decent life and know how to read, add, subtract, hold a job, etc&hellip;  There is just no effort from the black population to better themselves in any way.     </p>

					<p>I spent my formative years in a gentrifying ghetto.  We learned to stop locking our cars, so our windows wouldn&rsquo;t be smashed every month or so.  Anything left in a vehicle was obviously stolen, with the notable exception of a large stack of overdue library books that spent at least a month in the back of my mother&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>I assume it was civic-mindedness that encouraged the restraint.</p>

					<p>Spengler is right.  I have about 2,000 art books, pre 1968, books are great references to civilization before today, and mainly Whites take advantage of owning great books.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Blacks in Alaska&#8221;,,,,,</p>
<p> Years ago there was a TV show called &#8220;COPS&#8221;, one of the earlier &#8216;reality&rsquo; shows. They did a special once on Alaska. I remember thinking Alaska? Surely there wouldn&rsquo;t be much crime there of all places? Maybe just a lot of <span class="caps">DUI&rsquo;</span>s perhaps? Anyways I think every single case of someone being arrested on that program was black. </p>

					<p>Here is an example which supports what many of the posters are saying.</p>
<p>Years ago, as a former employee of a <span class="caps">HBCU,</span> I had the unenviable duty of assisting these poor souls during registration drives.  During these &#8220;drives&#8221;, the employees would end up signing up all these hapless souls who no doubt decided over the Christmas or summer holidays (most likely after speaking to other &#8220;bruthas and sistas&#8221; who profited from the lax student aid regulations)to earn $$ by going to school.  Once the students were registered for classes and aid applied, we would tell them how much aid they had left on their account to buy books(compliments of generous federal financial aid and you and I,  the taxpayers).  Upon telling &#8220;Lashawntae&#8221; how much money she had left to purchase her books, the actual response was:</p>
<p>&#8220;I <span class="caps">NEED BOOKS</span>??&#8221;</p>
<p>Need I say more?</p>

<p>Well, there&rsquo;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Permanent_Fund" rel="nofollow">state fund that disburses oil revenue to all citizens</a>. If Alaska doesn&rsquo;t define &#8220;citizen&#8221; stringently enough, then it&rsquo;s obvious why so many blacks are there. Perhaps an Alaskan here can enlighten us.</p>

					<p>I do not think that it is merely low black IQ which accounts for black academic failure.  It is also the ghetto culture of &#8220;dumb is good&#8221;.  So one has both genetic and enviornmental factors leading to an outcome, low black literacy.<br>
The fact is, the statement is true; blacks should be more concerned about attacking the culture of dumb is good than about being insulted by the truth.</p>

					<p>&#8220;According to a report that came out recently, &ldquo;one in four Americans read no books last year.&rdquo; Forty-two percent of college graduates never read another book after they get out of college. A third of high school graduates never read another book for the rest of their lives. 44 million Americans are &ldquo;functionally illiterate.&rdquo; 21 million can&rsquo;t read or write at all. A fifth of high school graduates can&rsquo;t read their diplomas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the people I know, including everyone in my family, have no intellectual curiosity about the world around them. None. They just don&rsquo;t care&#8221;</p>
<p>Virtually all of these 44 million &#8220;americans&#8221; are mexicans etc. However, I do get your point. I have never met a white person who can&rsquo;t read and white people do read a lot but it is <span class="caps">WHAT </span>they read. It is either fluff stuff such as Harry Potter or romance novels or the mainstream newspapers and magazines which are so politically correct it is not even funny. Americans have been so beaten down by politcal correctness that many have lost their ability to think outside the box and don&rsquo;t even realize it. Question anything not politically correct and you&rsquo;re a racist. . This is what is causing the &#8220;mental dullness.&#8221; I&rsquo;ll say this &#8220;mental dullness&#8221; however is not just an &#8220;american phenomenem. It is the same in canada, europe and australia. You better go along with what your marxist masters tell you are you are a horrible evil racist. They&rsquo;ve done a much better job than Hitler. He only mesmerized the german people, marxists have mesmerized a large portion of the white race.</p>

<p>In Alaska, not only is there no income tax, but the state govenment actually pays <span class="caps">YOU, </span>something like $3500 a head <span class="caps">EACH YEAR, </span>as a resident of Alaska: Paid for on the backs of the rest of us at the gas pump since Alaska gets the money from state taxes on oil shipped out of Alaska.<br>
Giving away money for nothing is not exactly the best way to attract good decent hardworking productive people.<br><br>
Anywhere there are generous govenment checks being given out, word quickly spreads through black communities especially and that place becomes a magnate. It wasn&rsquo;t long before Anchorage was experiencing the joys of the presence of violent black gangs like the Bloods and the Crips.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Is there any place on the planet Native Americans can go and not be followed, soon after by white people?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Where&rsquo;s my <span class="caps">ROFL </span>icon? Are you the same troll who posted in the other thread that whites kill blacks at amazingly higher rates than the other way around?!</p>
<p>First of all, you&rsquo;re not &#8216;Native American&rsquo;   &mdash;   you&rsquo;re an American Indian by designation and Mongoloid by origin.<br>
Secondly, you&rsquo;ve obviously never heard of the Bering Strait Bridge or the Kennewick Man.<br><br>
Lastly (in relation to your uninformed remark), point me to any white person who has followed blacks wherever they go, live, play, work (hahaha - I said &#8216;work&rsquo;   &mdash;   sorry), recreate, hang out, ad infinitum. And conversely, I <b>challenge</b> you to name me <b>one</b> continent, country, state, city, country, borough, neighborhood, street, building, room or molecule of space that has <span class="caps">IMPROVED </span>(or at <span class="caps">BEST</span>), remained the same when whites moved out and blacks moved in? <b><span class="caps">JUST ONE</span></b>&hellip;</p>
<p>(&hellip;And no, don&rsquo;t try using Prince George County as the sole exception to the rule. That was debunked on here a long time ago (many times). Even the black city council members thought it was an embarrasment that they had to bring in a white person to pick up the failed pieces of black government.)</p>

					<p><i>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about white nationalists in general is that they&rsquo;re big readers. They read everything. They read all sorts of books &mdash; lots of history, lots of obscure stuff that was written before 1960 when the rot started to take hold for real. They&rsquo;re <span class="caps">INTERESTED </span>in the world and that makes all the difference.</i></p>
<p>I would have to say that my own interest in white nationalism came about not as a confrontation with affirmative action, but through reading about the plight of white farmers in Mbeki&rsquo;s South Africa&hellip;and I only stumbled across that article because it was printed in an English-language politically-incorrect Japanese newspaper.  Those who get their news from <span class="caps">CNN </span>don&rsquo;t have a prayer. </p>

<p><br>
I can understand your hesitation to assign the blame to low black <span class="caps">IQ.</span> Even for many somewhat-aware whites, talk of race and IQ still feels somehow taboo. In today&rsquo;s poisonous PC atmosphere, it is &#8220;thinking the unthinkable.&#8221; Nothing will get you labeled A Bad Person faster. And nobody likes to think of themselves as A Bad Person. </p>
<p>But after wrestling with this question myself   &mdash;   and educating myself on the subject through AmRen and other non-MSM info sources   &mdash;   I eventually could not come to any other conclusion. I decided that it <span class="caps">DOES </span>come down to the differential <span class="caps">AVERAGE </span>levels of intelligence between the races. </p>
<p>It may sound like circular logic or a tautology, but that ghetto culture of &ldquo;dumb is good&rdquo; could <span class="caps">ONLY </span>take hold among people who are dumb to begin with. Whites could never be convinced that &#8220;dumb is good.&#8221; Neither could Asians. Whites and Asians don&rsquo;t have a &#8220;dumb is good&#8221; culture because we&rsquo;re both smart enough know that dumb is <span class="caps">NOT </span>good. We know that dumb causes problems. We instinctively recognize that dumb makes the world go backwards, not forwards. </p>
<p>And <span class="caps">WHY </span>do we whites and Asians know this? </p>
<p>Because we aren&rsquo;t dumb. <br>

					<p>Intelligent and intellectually curious people are naturally drawn to literature as a means to broaden their minds. How many great works of African literature can you think of? Was the printing press invented in Africa? Most blacks would just say that reading isn&rsquo;t &#8220;a black thing&#8221;. That is actually true, but not for reasons they would care to admit. </p>

					<p>There is a certain anti-intellectual element even among European descended people, and probably among Asians, I don&rsquo;t know. It is the nerd-complex vs. the jock complex. Think Bart Simpson, everyboy hero. Clever or cunning, but not in a disciplined, book-learning sort of way. Think Joe Dimaggio. What brain power was he ever know for? Billy the Kid? Forrest Gump? This probably stems from the fact that exceptional advances and innovations are not made by average people, but by exceptionally intelligent people who did excell in &#8220;book learning&#8221; at some point even if not in the conventional way. So &#8220;average&#8221; people feel inferior even though it is the average people who make these inventions and innovations function  on a daily basis.<br>
  Now when you have a large population of below-average people, the distance between the inventors of civilization and the users of civilization becomes even larger and less comprehending of each other.</p>
