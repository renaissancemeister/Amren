						<p>Things could not be worse for the Indian tourism industry. Recent incidents of rape and sexual molestation or harassment of visiting foreign women have had an impact on the tourist inflow.</p>
<p>Seven cases were reported in the first month of the year.</p>
<p>A Swedish teenage was molested at a New Year&rsquo;s Eve party at Kochi in Kerala state, while a number of tourists were also heckled. Three foreign women reported sexual harassment in Goa. Also in Goa, two British women claimed to have been sexually assaulted by the owner of a resort.</p>
<p>The Indian government called the incidents isolated, but a recent BBC report on one of the British women raped in Goa stated, &#8220;She is just one victim among thousands. The numbers are horrifying. On average across India there are 53 rapes a day, and recently released government statistics suggest that it is the fastest growing crime in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the issue may be affecting industry revenues, it has also brought out the fact that Indian policing has virtually collapsed. Women tourists are no longer safe in the country.</p>
<p>The impact of the incidents abroad has been bad. The American and British governments have warned women not to go to India for their summer break.</p>
<p>Crime statistics for 2006, released by the Home Ministry&rsquo;s National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), show that 18 women are victims of crime every hour. The number of rapes a day has increased nearly 700 per cent since 1971, when such cases were first recorded by the NCRB. The number has grown from 7 to 53 rape cases per day.</p>
<p>Several sexual attacks have been reported in Rajasthan, the jewel of Indian tourism. It is one destination where culture speaks for itself and where the spirit of India is evident in its people, ambience and buildings.</p>
<p>With a record arrival in 2005-06 of more than 1.2 million foreign tourists and 17 million domestic tourists, Rajasthan has been one of the most popular destinations for tourists, especially those from France, Britain, Germany, the US, Italy, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Today Rajasthan is the tourist-rape capital of India. Just before Christmas, an American national was molested in Pushkar and a British journalist was raped in Udaipur. Earlier, a French woman was raped, also in Pushkar. In 2005 in Rajasthan, a German tourist was raped by an auto-rickshaw driver and his accomplice in Jodhpur.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rajasthan has always been considered a very peaceful state, but the recent rape and molestation cases have been affecting its image,&#8221; a tourism department official admitted recently.</p>
<p>There have been other incidents of rape elsewhere in India. Tourism department officials are &#8220;concerned,&#8221; but things may have gotten out of hand. A tourism department official was recently quoted saying, &#8220;The reports could deter potential visitors to the country. We have asked states to report to us what happened in these incidents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Travel guidebooks have started advising women traveling to India to wear &#8220;loose, long clothes&#8221; to avoid unwelcome attention.</p>
<p>India attracts around 5 million tourists every year. As a face-saving exercise the tourism industry plans to create complaint centers and dedicated phone numbers for tourist security in all the major tourist destinations. The tourism ministry has decided to hire retired defense personnel for security and to deploy police in the top 10 destinations frequented by foreign travelers. But whether these actions will help remains to be seen.<br>

			<p>Why go to India and be sexually asaulted when you can stay in Sweden, England or America and be assaulted by &#8220;men of color&#8221;. </p>

			<p>Europe has enough culture and history to keep people busy for a lifetime. The romanticized view (more likely sanitized) some people have of alien cultures leads them into danger.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The tourism ministry has decided to hire retired defense personnel for security and to deploy police in the top 10 destinations frequented by foreign travelers. But whether these actions will help remains to be seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a nation of overpopulation, where a sea of humanity could overwhelm police or military at any gven moment, it is constantly very close to a Soylent Green scenario where armed private security guards with assault weapons have to be stationed everywhere, because the police can&rsquo;t control even the normal, everyday crime, and the riotous or unusual is something of a low scale disaster.  </p>
<p>This is a brief glimpse of the overpopulated world of the 21st century that works on priorities.  Only the gravest, most serious crimes can be pursued. Tourist rapes are not high priority crimes, and peon on peon murders will receive about the same attention.  In such a world the populace concentrates on just bare survival.</p>
<p>This is the situation that is being created globally with corrupt demagogues pressing for more economic growth at all costs to keep their rusted capitalist engines hitting on as many cylinders as possible, because if they stop for any length of time complete anarchy will be the order of the day.  So they concentrate on expansion, which means more incoming immigrants for peon labor, which results in additional ingredients in their already explosive contentious tribal conflicts.</p>
<p>Only a return to a sane homogeneous society that is built on a sound farming system, with maximum self-sufficiency could save the day.  But forget about that.  Greed has been the great motivator by all those elitists who created this precarious situation and greed will be the precurser to complete destruction. <br>

			<p>I know the feminists will jump all over me but there are countries in the world where women do not need to go unaccompanied. I have driven all over the US alone or with my baby and never felt afraid at all, I knew how to be safe and followed basic safety rules. </p>

<p>Of course, this is only after the fact and nothing more will be done. Fill out the form, mail it in, and in a few months you will get a form letter saying no suspects confessed to the crime. (Just like everywhere else.)</p>
<p>No wonder rape is becoming a national sport. Maybe the Chinese will add it as a sport in the upcoming Olympics.</p>

			<p>This seems to be prevalent in most third-world countries as well as among Muslim &#8220;youths&#8221; (let&rsquo;s not forget to mention black American males).  We are prey!</p>

			<p>This is really primarily aimed at White women who come to India unfortunately. I would urge White women to stay away from India until they are completely sure this has stopped.</p>

			<p>In my 3rd world country white women are safer than back in the USA. We also have very few militant Muslims and virtually no Pakistanis and Indians. So, the second sentence infers the first.</p>

			<p>Here in England, entire &#8216;indian&rsquo; families conspire to kill their own daughters if they associate with anyone not of their &#8216;caste&rsquo;. Sometimes they are caught out but an ethnic web of silence frustrates the authorities. Same goes for muslim families. I don&rsquo;t know why we bother to consider these cases as crimes as it is considered &#8216;culturally insensitive&rsquo; to interfere with these barbaric acts in our own country. There are cases in india where the entire male population of a village will rape one of their own women to avenge some perceived wrongdoing by a male member of her family. But that is accepted tradition, in place long before white women tourists arrived, so don&rsquo;t be surprised at these rape cases, they will never be taken seriously in india.  </p>

			<p>Alot of these rapes are commited by Indian muslim youths (there are 200 million muslim Indians), I know this because when I visited Goa the names of the rapists in the local papers sounded Islamic.   </p>

<p>I wish that some massive disaster would shatter that land for a few years, so the traitors who sold their countrymen&rsquo;s jobs across the sea for a few dollars would get a taste of their own medicine.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This is a brief glimpse of the overpopulated world of the 21st century&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The 21st century is starting to look like the ancient world in many ways. There&rsquo;s a great book called Ancient Siege Warfare by Paul Bentley Kern which describes the way things were back then. It was an incredibly violent landscape. Cities had to wall themselves in to protect themselves from massacre, pillage, rape and slavery. Farmers who couldn&rsquo;t retreat into a walled city during raids were butchered or dragged off in chains. Their crops were torched in any case.</p>
<p>A gated community is nothing but a small-scale version of a walled city. The same thing applies to corporate parks, &#8220;exotic&#8221; tourist areas and upper-income residential districts. Look at New Orleans, for instance, or the various &#8220;tourist attractions&#8221; in the Caribbean, Mexico and South America. In every case, they&rsquo;re surrounded by violent ghettos and Third World chaos. The prosperous whites who vacation there are natural targets. <br>
 <br>
It&rsquo;s amazing to read that India&rsquo;s police force seems to have collapsed. I thought India was supposed to be turning into a First World country with all of its IT support centers and the like. The reality looks a lot different. Globalization, overpopulation and the destruction of the middle class are creating &#8220;cultures&#8221; where a small group of rich elites live in high-security compounds with their servants in the middle of a huge teeming mass of violent poverty. The future is starting to look a lot like the past.</p>

The entire country looks like a typical skidrow you see in any large urban area. </p>

			<p>I have been been to India and have some tips which could prevent such things happening.</p>
<p>1] Firstly, I do not know why one would want to go there in the first place with all that cheating and rip-offs. Why not go to Europe including Russia and enjoy it&rsquo;s history. That way money goes into preserving those sites. There is more in Europe to see for a lifetime. </p>
<p>2] The Far-East is a much safer option and is filled with culutral and historical sites. The people are much friendlier.</p>
<p>3] In countries like India, women should as far as possib3e always travel with men.</p>
<p>4] Women should as far as possible dress conservatively. I am not talking about the burkha here but sayb salwar kameez with scalf around the head. Observe how muslims dress in Europe or Iran before you go and if weather permit dress like them.</p>
<p>5] I would suggest white guys going to India and Sri Lanka to grow moustaches. Men with moustaches are respected here. In Pakistan or Bangladesh it is the beard which rules.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Travel guidebooks have started advising women traveling to India to wear &ldquo;loose, long clothes&rdquo; to avoid unwelcome attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>That might work. But, staying out of that part of the world altogether would definitely work.  </p>
<p>Seriously: Why does anyone want to visit India?  I&rsquo;m happy looking at photos.  Silk, curry, and peacocks are all available locally. </p>

<p>This will be the entire USA,Canada,Europe and Australia is this immigration both legal and illegal isn&rsquo;t halted.<br>

<p>Oh lookee, the sensitive Hindu brigade is at it again.  Break time in Bangalore?  Can&rsquo;t disturb the progress of the noble Anglosphere, huh, what with our shared values and language.  Albion&rsquo;s seedlings can flog Muslims and China all they want, but, mark my words, it&rsquo;ll be our cultural cousins in Hindia and english-speaking Africa who will break our backs.</p>
