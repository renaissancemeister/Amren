						<p>The broad-brimmed western hats, colorful festival dance dresses and Mayan-style pottery that line the shelves at Xochi&rsquo;s Mexican Imports are common sights at stores in the Southwest.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s southwest Detroit on a cold, dreary winter day, not sunny El Paso, San Diego, Tucson or other cities just north of the Mexican border.</p>
<p>From its Mexican Town restaurant district to the new shops of the La Plaza Mercado retail development, southwest Detroit is doing something it hasn&rsquo;t done in years &mdash; grow and prosper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latinos are carving out a niche in neighborhoods far from the southern border more and more &mdash; from Bagley Street here to the Mitchell Street area in Milwaukee to Bailey&rsquo;s Crossroads in Fairfax County, Va.</p>
<p>A new wave of Latino immigrants is following others who established communities in northern cities in the 1950s after getting jobs in the auto and other manufacturing industries. The attraction now is employment in restaurants, shops and other service-oriented businesses that cater primarily to residents in those communities but also draw non-Latinos.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&rsquo;t a neighborhood where you could walk down the street,&#8221; Southwest Detroit Business Association deputy director Edith J. Castillo said. &#8220;Now, you can actually walk down West Vernor. You can take your family out for ice cream after church.&#8221;</p>
<p>Castillo&rsquo;s nonprofit is one of several working with city officials and businesses to resurrect the area.</p>
<p>More than $200 million has been invested in southwest Detroit in the past 15 years, which has attracted retail and new homes, including an $11 million condo development.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The neighborhood is doing so well the mayor didn&rsquo;t include it in his plan to pump millions of dollars into distressed areas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About half the residents claim a Hispanic heritage, 25 percent are black, 20 percent are white and 5 percent are Arab-American, according to the Southwest Detroit Business Association.</p>
<p>In contrast, more than 80 percent of Detroit&rsquo;s 920,000 residents are black.</p>
<p>And while the city&rsquo;s overall population has plummeted in recent decades because of white flight and more recently the exodus of the black middle class, the southwest side&rsquo;s population has grown considerably, up 6.9 percent to more than 96,000 people from 1990 to 2000.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s Latino population grew by nearly 19,000 over that period to more than 47,000.</p>
<p>Without the manufacturing jobs that attracted many to places like Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and Chicago in the 1950s and 1960s, Latinos have found opportunities in their own backyards, Figueroa said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexican restaurants and bars along Mitchell Street and in other parts of Milwaukee attract non-Latinos, but it&rsquo;s Latinos that keep the bakeries and grocery stores open, Figueroa said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is enough money in the economy that people can sustain retail establishments by primarily relying on Latino clientele,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like I&rsquo;m at home,&#8221; [32-year-old dance instructor Valeria Montes] said. &#8220;I go to get a haircut, I speak Spanish. I go to mercado (market), I speak Spanish. My daughter goes to school and there are a lot of Latino kids. It&rsquo;s a great feeling.&#8221;</p>

					<p>As if Detroit didn&rsquo;t already didn&rsquo;t have enough crime.  The next big thing to come out of Detroit will be Black vs. Chicano turf wars and school fights like we already have in Southern California.</p>

					<p>Detroit had nowhere to go but up to begin with.  Improving it, therefore, was not a very high bar to flop over.</p>

					<p>Blacks displace whites. Latinos displace blacks. That&rsquo;s why Latinos have revived Detroit somewhat. But blacks may get angry and retaliate. And I&rsquo;ve noticed that East Asians (e.g., Chinese, Hmong, Cambodians) have an incredible ability to displace anyone!</p>
<p>But Latinos can only turn the city around to a small extent. If Latinos had the abilities and prowess of whites, Mexico wouldn&rsquo;t be such an economic disaster, and Mexicans wouldn&rsquo;t be pouring into the United States like rats deserting a sinking ship. It seems that Latinos are turning Detroit around because their achievements are measured relative to blacks&rsquo; comparable achievements. Latinos would be hindering Detroit, not helping it, if their efforts were compared to what whites would accomplish.</p>

<p><span class="caps">LIAR</span>!!!  </p>
<p>West Vernor has <span class="caps">ALWAYS </span>been a bee hive of bussiness activity during daylight hours; this is not new news; however, West Vernor is also a high crime area rife with drug addicts, drug dealers, homeless alcoholics, ex-cons, etc., etc., etc. That area of the city is exceedingly dangerous especially after dark. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, try hanging out at Clark Park on a hot summer night. </p>

					<p>Blacks are the reason Detroit is the way it is.</p>
<p>The difference between latinos and blacks is that, although many latinos are criminally minded and a detriment to civilization, most are not.</p>
<p>This situation is reversed with blacks.  Except for a handful, <span class="caps">MOST </span>blacks are criminally minded and, as a population, blacks cannot sustain any of the hallmarks of civilization without intense, direct and continuing uplift from whites.</p>
<p>Witness Zimbabwe and now South Africa.  All elements of modern society are collapsing as a direct result of blacks being in control.  The exact same thing is happening in detroit but is limited by intervention by whites.</p>
<p>There is no hope that blacks will ever take their place in the modern world.  In the <span class="caps">US, </span>the immigration issue is very much both parties plus corporate america giving up completely on them.  They are attempting to replace blacks, completely in our society, with latinos.</p>
<p>Of some concern is what these people plan to do with blacks.  Based on what they have been doing so far, as a society, we should be quite concerned.  <br>
Certainly, the &#8220;black problem&#8221; is an issue that does not lend itself to a ready solution.  But, by no stretch of the imagination is the &#8220;final solution&#8221; an appropriate one.  In such behaviors, the american left shows its clear links to fascism, not the soft, smiley face liberal fascism, but the hardcore nazi style fascism that shares its genesis with Marx and French Revolution.<br><br>

					<p>Another factor is the fact that whites will cleanse themselves from blackening areas pretty quickly, but tend to hang around in Latino areas as a dwindling minority.</p>

					<p>The Latinos are taking over.  I&rsquo;ve already given in to the fact that we have lost our historical culture and must now adapt or die for the future.  Latinos are not girly like the Caucasians and I am Caucasian and a staunch American.  As much as I am against immigration, I&rsquo;d never support the racist African community over the Latino because the Latino are 1000 times better.  The African community is the most racist on earth.  Everything they do is an expression of their racism.  They are animals and supporting any civilized tribe is much more honest and intelligent to do than supporting those people.</p>

					<p>Most people, whites in particular, will never grasp the liberal black mindset when it comes to political office and public service in general.  These blacks look at the public positions as chances to suck resources from the communities to include money, perks and always, prestige and power.</p>
<p>Liberal black community honchos are practiced on rhetoric and know how to play a black crowd like a cheap fiddle.  The black politicos dress to the nines and in every public speech, they appeal to the toxic tribalism of a population who prioritizes style over substance   &mdash;   hands down. </p>
<p>The willful ignorance of the average black citizen is demanded.  </p>
<p>A quick Bible verse, a story of how the administrator, councilperson or mayor (whomever is speaking) rose from chaos to their lofty position holds their flock in blind adoration. It&rsquo;s no shame in the black &#8220;community&#8221; to blow your own horn and  brag yourself up in public. These crowds are completely &#8220;owned&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Because lying, graft and corruption get a wink and a pass from the local citizens in the black community, the pretty-suited political activist or politician knows they can basically milk the system for all it&rsquo;s worth.  After all, as the black citizens believe, whites owe them so it&rsquo;s okay and anyway, things like character, integrity, personal responsibility and virtue are for white folks. </p>
<p>Blacks know that their growing numbers will reduce the community they live in to third-world status and that, in a few short years.  They don&rsquo;t care because it&rsquo;s payback time, as they see it.  Slavery, don&rsquo;t cha know.  If whites object, it&rsquo;s &#8220;racism!&#8221;.</p>
<p>When blacks move in to a new community, they immediately demand a black parasite be appointed to high positions in the local government to represent   &mdash;   blacks. (ain&rsquo;t diversity great?)  They know that their brutha or sista will ultimately be elected to even higher posts as the black numbers grow.   </p>
<p>After a few of their bruthas and sistas &#8220;get paid&#8221; while in office, blacks believe they have proved their tribal loyalty and then move on to another city or town.  Then it starts all over again.</p>
<p>This IS the sick cycle common among the majority of blacks, and there&rsquo;s no end in sight.  Coming to a community near you!  Maybe yours!     </p>

					<p>I have seen a city block on Livernois Avenue in Detroit where Mexicans have fixed up the buildings and converted them into businesses.  Previously, those buildings had been converted into near ruins by blacks that have been pillaging the city for decades.  Where Mexican&rsquo;s have moved into neighborhoods, there is an appearance of stability and some improvement.  This is in contrast to the black areas, which inevitably appear to be undergoing an increasing level of decay.  There are poor Whites living down in these areas of Detroit along side the Mexicans.  You do not see poor Whites living along side Blacks in the ordinary neighborhoods of Detroit.  Most areas of Detroit were ethnically cleansed of Whites many years back without comment by the mass media or any fuss made by politicians.  </p>
<p>As Detroit went down the drain a lot of White people were hurt physically, financially and spiritually.  The mass of White people just let this all happen.  What is it about White people that allow them to relinquish control of an entire city to a criminalized community that hates them?  I don&rsquo;t see Mexican people doing that and I don&rsquo;t think they would ever allow such a thing to happen.  We came blame blacks all day but our own people are the problem.</p>

					<p>How nice that people like Valeria Montes feel so &#8220;at home&#8221; in my hometown.  And it&rsquo;s because of all the people around her speaking Spanish?  Because of all of those &#8220;Latino&#8221; businesses, there to &#8220;cater primarily to residents&#8221;?   If I dare to visit, how will I  fare, and how welcome will I be?  </p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;d really care to, now.  In my hometown (Detroit), we spoke English.   </p>
<p>To Ms. Castillo&rsquo;s statement : &#8220;It wasn&rsquo;t a neighborhood where you could walk down the street&#8221;- Yes, it was.  Once upon a time, not really all that long ago. </p>
<p>Then it was made dangerous for everybody by people who hate whites especially. </p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t look like revitalization to me.  It looks like colonization by a foreign  people, with a different culture.  </p>
<p>By the way, Latino is a misnomer.  Illi latini non sunt.  </p>

					<p>For far too many years Blacks have learned to expect government and tax payers to fix their problems. There is no work ethic, just a endless list of excuses and guilt trips. With the growing wave of Hispanics who still manage to find work, and start their own businesses, their excuses are ringing more hollow every day.</p>

					<p>The Mexicans who settle in Detroit will buy ghetto real estate at fire sale prices, make significant improvements on same (creating economic activity), and sell it back to the Blacks at a profit.  The downside to this though is that the Blacks will be using all sorts of taxpayer subsidized sub-prime mortgage money gimmicks to buy back into the revitalized areas, trash the Barrio again, and default again.</p>

&#8220;Without the manufacturing jobs that attracted many to places like Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and Chicago in the 1950s and 1960s, Latinos have found opportunities in their own backyards, Figueroa said.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Their own backyards&#8221;? Their own backyards are in Tijuana, Oaxaca, and Tegucigalpa. Their own backyards are dirt-patches containing unwashed urchins, empty Tecate cans, a makeshift cockfighting ring, and a &#8216;64 Impala up on blocks. </p>
<p>As other posters have noted, any &#8220;revitalization&#8221; of this area by Spanish-speaking Indios only looks good in relation to the above-ground Hades of the bantustan that preceded it. Compared to a <span class="caps">WHITE </span>area, this &#8220;Little Mexico&#8221; would suddenly reveal itself for what it really is: El Barrio, complete with all the dysfunction, overbreeding, low-achievement, drug abuse, drunk-driving, and gang-banging endemic to <span class="caps">EVERY OTHER </span>barrio on the planet. </p>
<p>Back in the early 20th Century, what made Detroit a population magnet in the first instance? Here&rsquo;s a hint: it wasn&rsquo;t the weather. It was, of course, The Big Three and related auto-making industries. Please note these mega-corporations were founded and built by people with names like Henry and Walter   &mdash;   and <span class="caps">NOT </span>names like Enrique and Octavio. Each of these companies could provide tens of thousands of jobs. How many thousands of jobs will Xochi&rsquo;s Mayan pottery shop generate? How about Ignacio&rsquo;s bodega? How about Consuela&rsquo;s taco truck?</p>

<p>As another poster once stated, living in a Mexican neighborhood with a gang presence is kind of like living in an Italian neighborhood controlled by the mafia many years ago. If you don&rsquo;t mess with their business, they generally won&rsquo;t bother you. Also, the Mexican gangs around here are controlled by the Mexican Mafia, which is closely allied with the Aryan Brotherhood. There is little chance that they&rsquo;ll ever jeopardize their relationship with the ABs by &#8220;green lighting&#8221; whites the way that they have blacks.</p>

					<p>Revitalization - No, transformation, yes.  </p>
<p>Revitalization is when the existing population brings back the viability of their city on their own.  Replacing the existing population with another is nothing but transformation of the city, the original population was not revitalized but replaced.  It&rsquo;s a simple concept to understand, why are we continuously propagandized to believe otherwise?</p>
<p>Replacement is not revitalization, just ask any worker replaced by a foreigner imported to replace them who will work for poverty wages.  Was the displaced worker revitalized?  I think not.</p>

					<p>Mexican town actually attacts White suburbanites from the Metro division, who come to dine at their restaurants, which is also bringing in extra revenue. The mostly Black section of the city is one that is avoided at all costs. Commuters stay on the freeway, and don&rsquo;t think of getting off. until they reach downtown, or their intended destination. So yes, it is safe to say that Whites do feel more comfortable among Hispanics than Blacks. </p>

<p>Excellent point!  I would rather live in a Mexican neighborhood than a black neighborhood, but would be miserable in either.  </p>
<p>Blacks are more prone to violence and riots, but mestizos are ghetto-makers as well.  Both groups <span class="caps">LOVE </span>littering and drunk driving, and I&rsquo;ve seen a lot more loitering and public urination from latinos than blacks.  While the few Detroit whites may be choosing to live in the Mexican area rather than the black area, it shouldn&rsquo;t be seen as an endorsement of their culture.  </p>
<p>Mexicans litter like there is no tomorrow, but I&rsquo;ve noticed that the darker the local meztisos are the more they litter.  My area of Northern Virginia used to have growing litter problems when we had an influx of Mexicans who looked about 1/2 white.  It was disturbing enough back then!</p>
<p>Now we are inundated by Mexicans and Central Americans who look 100% Indian; I see men under 5 ft tall with dark skin and Aztec noses, and some of the women are closer to 4 ft tall and look directly out of the jungle.  With the darkening of the &#8220;undocumented&#8221; has come and <span class="caps">EXPLOSION </span>in litter.  Disgusting!  They also steal shopping carts and leave them all over private property.      </p>
<p>Our condo complex just had our first &#8220;tagging&#8221; incident.  Some degenerate used black spray paint to write something illegible on our concrete stairs that face the bus stop frequented by the Amigos from the apartments across the street.  We&rsquo;re planning to put in a 4ft tall wrought iron fence to cut the bus stop off from our property.  I hope it works - our lawyers are afraid that the County will refuse to give us the fence permit because we&rsquo;ve made so many complaints about their refusal to fight trespassing on our property (which the county has tacitly encouraged by not building sidewalks to their bus stops).</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks living in latino neighborhoods isn&rsquo;t bad has never noticed that the lighter/taller Mexicans like to leave the barrio for white neighborhoods when the darker/shorter &#8220;mexicans&#8221; move in.  Call it Mestizo flight, or jungle-fication&hellip;the more Indian the Mexicans are, the less they are compatible with civilization!  A majority Mexican neighborhood <i>can still slide further downhill</i> as the turnover in the hovels goes more and more Indian.  Rejects from the Central American jungle have very low IQs and no place in a western society - they also have <span class="caps">HORDES </span>of kids, none of which will ever contribute to progress.  </p>

					<p>As if Detroit didn&rsquo;t already didn&rsquo;t have enough crime. The next big thing to come out of Detroit will be Black vs. Chicano turf wars and school fights like we already have in Southern California.</p>
<p>The same thing is likely to happen in the city of New Orleans, which has an ever growing Chicano population. I think many Americans have had blinders on believing such conflicts will remain limited to the West coast. Today, Black flight is on the rise, and Blacks are running to White communities at an even faster pace than before.</p>

					<p>In line with what another poster said, try the story like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;The quaint, independently owned coffee shops, organic grocery co-ops and art galleries are common sights in the neigborhoods of trendy coastal cities.</p>
<p>But this is southwest Detroit on a cold, dreary winter day, not SoHo, Cambridge, or Seattle.</p>
<p>White people are carving out a niche in neighborhoods far from the suburban enclaves  &mdash;  from Bagley Street here to the Mitchell Street area in Milwaukee to Bailey&rsquo;s Crossroads in Fairfax County, Va.</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of white people who are moving in  &mdash;  whether yuppie liberals or conservative young professionals  &mdash;  are finding jobs downtown,&#8221; said John Smith, professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Grocery stores and pharmacies along Mitchell Street and in other parts of town attract non-whites, but it&rsquo;s whites that keep the sandwich shops and Irish pubs open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is enough money in the economy that people can sustain retail establishments by primarily relying on a white clientele,&rdquo; Smith said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m at home,&rdquo; 32-year-old dance instructor Jane Doe said. &ldquo;When I go to get my hair done, the hairdresser speaks proper English. I go to the co-op, the staff speaks English. My daughter goes to school and there are a lot of white kids. It&rsquo;s a great feeling.&rdquo;<br>

<p>You must have had experience with the Mexicans in California. I&rsquo;ve not had too much trouble with Arizona or Texas Mexicans, but I&rsquo;ve heard horror stories about Mexicans in California. They&rsquo;re evidently a rotten bunch. I attribute it to the facts that California is a huge welfare magnet and that most white men there are emasculated liberals who never keep or bear arms or defend themselves even if the idiots in Sacramento allowed them to.</p>
<p>Things are a bit different in Texas and Arizona. The white men here are still men. We have the right to keep and bear arms for our security and defense and we often do so and the Mexicans know it. And like I said, California is a huge welfare magnet that draws the worst of the Mexican invasion unto herself.</p>

If mestizo areas are &#8220;better&#8221; than black areas, it&rsquo;s only because white people are less likely to be <span class="caps">ROBBED, RAPED </span>& <span class="caps">KILLED </span>in the former than in the latter. </p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not setting the bar very high, is it? </p>
<p>In my years in LA   &mdash;   which is of course Ground Zero for Reconquista   &mdash;   I&rsquo;ve known many white people (myself included) who&rsquo;ve lived in Mexican neighborhoods. In my case, I certainly didn&rsquo;t <span class="caps">ENJOY </span>my time in El Barrio   &mdash;   in fact, the noise, chaos, and general primitiveness of my Mexican neighbors made those years the most miserable of my life   &mdash;   but at least I got out with both my tires and my neck arteries unslashed. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known exactly <span class="caps">ONE </span>white here who lived in Da Get-toe (Watts), and that was an artist/sculptor type who needed a lot of square-footage on the cheap. He claims his black neighbors leave him alone (possibly because it&rsquo;s hard to find a &#8220;fence&#8221; who&rsquo;ll buy stolen sculptures), and that he likes living there. I wish him the best of luck with his homesteading   &mdash;   but I don&rsquo;t go to his homestead. He knows that if he wants to see his white friends, he&rsquo;s got to come to US in (what&rsquo;s left of) the city&rsquo;s white neighborhoods, because we sure as shootin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t going down to Watts. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s revealing that, of the hundreds (if not thousands) of whites here whom I&rsquo;ve listened to boast about how wonderful black people are, I&rsquo;ve only ever met <span class="caps">ONE </span>who actually lived among them. You can&rsquo;t really get a more reliable indicator of white liberals&rsquo; true feelings than that. Don&rsquo;t listen to what they say   &mdash;   look at where they choose to move.<br>
