<p>The 2008 presidential election may well turn on the voting of illegal aliens, who along with other non-citizens, are ineligible even to register to vote but in some cases still find a way.</p>
<p>During the past decade, the National Commission on Federal Election Reform found that &#8220;non-citizens do vote, albeit illegally.&#8221; The Commission also found that 261 counties reported more registered voters than they have residents &mdash; to the tune of tens of thousands of phantom voters. Recent election studies conclude that the methodology for determining the percentage of voters who are U.S. citizens is a challenge. Unqualified people, among them illegal aliens, are diluting the value of the citizen vote. Non-citizen voters, once an oxymoron, are sadly now the status quo.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. Constitution does not address voter registration per se, the election law that has evolved over the years sets the following rules: A voter must be a U.S. citizen (by birth or naturalization), must not be a convicted felon or be found mentally incompetent, and must be 18 years or older. A correlated requirement is that applicants for U.S. citizenship must be able to speak, read, and write English. Other than these basics, each governmental unit (local, state, or federal) determines its own voter registration rules.</p>
<p>Immigration advocates are pushing to have illegal aliens vote in the upcoming elections. States (such as California, Maine, Massachusetts, Texas, and Vermont) and cities (such as Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.) circumvent U.S. election law by permitting non-citizens to vote in local and state elections and therefore in federal elections.</p>
<p>In the recent Nevada caucuses, a federal judge ruled that the Democratic Party could set up special caucus sites in Las Vegas casinos for union workers, who had only to show a union membership card to enter the caucus. Did anyone check to see if these workers were, in fact, U.S. citizens? It was apparent from the television coverage that many of the union workers spoke no English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>o The Motor-Voter Act works like this: In 1994, a non-English speaking woman was observed in line using an interpreter to apply for and pass the Florida driver&rsquo;s test. The clerk then asked if she wished to register to vote. As her interpreter translated the message, the woman looked shocked and shook her head, no. The clerk pressed on saying, &#8220;You have a driver&rsquo;s license now, and the law says we must help you register to vote. Just say, yes.&#8221; Thus the right to vote was forced upon an obvious non-citizen. This is, by no means, an isolated incident.</p>
<p>Another example: In 2008, a U.S. district judge in Florida sentenced to prison a former employee of a county tax collector&rsquo;s office for peddling more than 150 driver&rsquo;s licenses to illegal aliens at $200 a head. Under the Motor-Voter Law, holders of these fraudulent licenses were then able to register to vote.</p>
<p>o 2002. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) opened the floodgates for non-citizen voters. A prospective voter need only produce a valid driver&rsquo;s license or the last four digits of the voter&rsquo;s social security number &mdash; verification of which does not establish U.S. citizenship. For those with no ID, the state will issue an identification number, issuance of which does not establish U.S. citizenship. Mail-in registration is easier yet &mdash; a person need only provide a copy of a current utility bill, a bank statement, a paycheck, or similar document with the person&rsquo;s name and address. None of which establishes U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>HAVA applies only to federal elections but through federal funding is now influencing state and local voting as well. The law was in reaction to voter confusion linked to poor ballot design in Florida during the 2000 presidential election.</p>
<p>Rather than address ballot design, however, HAVA changed the voter mail-in registration form, adding the question, &#8220;Are you a citizen of the United States of America?&#8221; This question was followed by boxes for the applicant to check yes or no. The Democrat Party, the ACLU, labor unions, and others have filed lawsuits to permit persons to vote via mail-in registration without having to check the citizenship boxes.</p>
<p>With a $10 billion annual budget, HAVA provides funds to the states to assure that voting is &#8220;fair and accurate.&#8221; The states are supposed to use the money to improve voting with new voting machines, voter assistance for the disabled, aged, and language-challenged, and voter education, including mock elections.</p>
<p>The ripple effect of HAVA includes establishment of the Election Assistance Commission with members, staff power, and funding; the Election Assistance Commission Standards Board, the Election Assistance Commission Board of Advisors, and the Technical Guidelines Development Committee. These HAVA spin-offs work with State Boards of Elections (SBOE), which in turn add more commissions and boards to promulgate additional rules and regulations to Help America Vote; note that the name of the law is not Help U.S. Citizens Vote.</p>
<p>Despite billions of federal dollars, HAVA has not stopped allegations of fraud and ballot failures in the 2004 and 2006 elections. Now electronic voting is being challenged and a return to paper ballots is being recommended by the same experts who found paper ballots faulty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Limit the Vote to U.S. Citizens</b></p>
<p>The combined immigration and election laws passed during the past 43 years have indeed diminished and diluted the vote of U.S. citizens. Public opinion polls, among them an MIT survey, find that more than 75 percent of U.S. citizens support strict and enforced election fraud laws, including the requirement for a government-issued photo identification at the time of balloting.</p>

			<p>No one should be surprised at this.  Note it is the Democrats and the ACLU who are usually behind this nonsense.  We need new and much tougher laws in every state, but don&rsquo;t worry if you are here illegally, Congress will not act becasue it would not be politicaly correct to do so.</p>
<p>Are we ever going to wake up?</p>

			<p>Th Real I.D. law is a sham that is intended strictly for keeping track of law-abiding white Americans.  The alien elements will always be able to forge their way around the system.</p>

			<p>What do you mean by may ? It is a proven fact many times at the congressional level, just asked ex-congressman Bob Dornan of Ca. about his conquerer named Sanchez. They district went from a republican, conservative, constitutional district to a unconstitutional anti-white, demo-rat-ic, liberal, Marxist district; so much for illegal alien invaders not having a voice in our corrupt, self-destructing,non-republic, anti-white racist communist country.</p>

			<p>Not surprised to read this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why the candidates who had already dropped out of the race are still on the ballot. It&rsquo;s electronic. Isn&rsquo;t it easy to change. Can&rsquo;t importance be placed on something? Is that a waste of someone&rsquo;s vote if they voted for one of these former candidates?  </p>

			<p>This is an embarassment.  You don&rsquo;t see me taking a trip to Italy, touring the bell Tower of Pisa, touring St Peter&rsquo;s Basilica, and voting for their president.  Why the hell are unauthorized tourists (basically what these guys are) voting in OUR elections?</p>

			<p>I suspect that&rsquo;s why McCain is winning.</p>
<p>Ron Paul, despite having only 42 delegates, is still in the race.  However, you&rsquo;d never know it if you get your news from the lame stream media, which keep telling us that there are now only two Republican candidates, McCain and Huckabee.  (Romney just left the race.)  The controllers of our society know that we must never be given the option of voting for a candidate who wants to enforce immigration law.<br>

			<p>Who&rsquo;s surprised?  Which law haven&rsquo;t they sidestepped?</p>
<p>Why would any party want masses of peasants voting?  </p>
<p>I wonder what will happen when the masses of uneducated peasants are herded like sheep and are convinced on how to vote and who to vote for?  Will they ever realize they are mere instruments of manipulation and their only value is in their numbers?</p>
<p>Keep them dumb, keep them poor, keep them struggling and always tell them you&rsquo;ll give them more. Tell them you&rsquo;re on their side, the side of the &#8220;worker&#8221;, the poor common man, you know their plight.  Tell them it&rsquo;s the fault of the rich who squander their wealth.</p>
<p>I wonder what will happen when the peasant masses can&rsquo;t get enough out of the government coffers?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got all the ingredients for the making of a third-world country. Just give it a little more time.</p>

<p>This country is lost.  With well over 50 million illegals in this country these people don&rsquo;t care a damn about what is right or wrong.</p>
<p>Big business has sold out this country and our politicians have gotten rich. </p>

			<p>Remember a while back there was a guy that cut down a mexican flag that was flying over a mexican business.</p>
<p>It was all over the television media.</p>
<p>There are not enough people like him.  There needs to be a LOT of people like him going to visit the politicians and let them know they are not going to take it any more.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it does not matter who you vote for.  They are all cut from the same cloth.  They are all professional liars.  They are all millionaires.  They do not care about the middle class and what america once was.</p>
<p>America is going the way of the roman empire.  That is to extinction brought on by greed, corruption, apathy, ignorance and of course a mainstream media that would make the communist and nazi propaganda writers blush.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think illegal immigrants voting is a serious problem yet, certainly not compared to the voter fraud that takes place in black districts.</p>

			<p>The Germans must feel cheated that they did&rsquo;nt have the possibilities which the Mexicans have today. Hitler could easily have sent some 1000 followers to the US to participate in  primaries in some key states in order to prevent the re-election of F. D. Roosevelt in 1936, which would have meant the victory of Germany in WW II. It would not even have been necessary that these fake citizen spoke English.<br>

			<p>America&rsquo;s youth is throwing away their future with a vote for the son of a goat herder.  I think this election will set the dominoes for generations to come.  The RNC is to blame for any injustices at the polls because every polling place has an R election judge.  What good are the election judges?  Are they  another angle of fraud we are only beginning to notice?  Who is leading the Republican party now?  This smells like a rotten election!</p>

			<p>The next president was &#8220;picked&#8221; years ago, as were the other future ones.  You don&rsquo;t really believe the same traitors who are selling our country to the highest bidders are capable of running honest elections do you?  Even if they wanted to their corporate masters will not allow it&hellip;  </p>

			<p>Goverment, Federal and State offices have been stuffing themselves full of non-white clerks and supervisors for decades.  The corruption, including graft and fraud - including the type this story illuminates, is what is destroying the U.S.  The graft alone, if stopped would represent a great deal of help for the social systems that should be helping REAL Americans.</p>

			<p>Blacks are a minority and their numbers are now lower than those of Hispanics.  The majority of whites will not vote for a black president nor will the Hispanics.  Hispanics are pushing blacks to the back of the bus and the black leadership has no problem with it.  Obama is a token black candidate and the notion that America will ever legitimately &ldquo;elect&rdquo; a black president is ludicrous.  Our governing corporate war racketeers &#8220;appointed&#8221; their choice for our next president years ago and the elections are nothing more than a public exercise in mental self-abuse&hellip;</p>
