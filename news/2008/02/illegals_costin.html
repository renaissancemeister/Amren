			<p>&#8220;13. In 2006 illegal aliens sent home $45 BILLION in remittances back to their countries of origin.&#8221; </p>
<p>Add to that figure the billions the legal third-world aliens are sending home every year and it becomes apparent that this nation is being bled dry by people with no love of America nor loyalty to this nation.  Washington is doing its level best to turn the image of our Lady Liberty into a woman of ill repute who sells herself to the highest bidders&hellip;</p>

			<p>These budget numbers are amazing if they&rsquo;re true. Most of the source links were broken and the Snopes article appears to be unrelated. In any case, I don&rsquo;t really doubt that Federal, state and local governments are spending billions on illegal immigrants. That&rsquo;s how the game works these days. Employers can save a fortune on labor costs by bringing in cheap foreign workers and paying them next to nothing, but all the social costs like housing, education and medical care are passed on to the taxpayer. That&rsquo;s why cheap labor is so cheap  &mdash;  for the employers. I guess you could call this the &#8220;socialization of labor costs.&#8221; If it&rsquo;s really true that our glorious leaders are spending more on illegal immigrants than they are on their occupation of Iraq  &mdash;  another total waste of money if you ask me  &mdash;  I&rsquo;d say it was way past time for a massive tax strike, if not a revolution.</p>

			<p>My wife and I are each working 6 days a week to keep our heads above water and provide for our children.  Meanwhile, when you add up all the taxes we pay (gasoline tax, sales tax, property tax, phone tax, utility tax, hotel tax, airport security fees, Social Security, Medicaid, State income tax, Federal Income tax, etc.) we find that 50% of our income is going to taxes. We are rats on a treadmill, running as fast as we can to provide money to support the children of Mexicans.  </p>
<p>To our government officials: Why do you prefer illegal aliens over American Citizens?  Please, help Americans for a change. The purpose of the USA government is the welfare of Americans, not the welfare of Mexicans, Nigerians, Iraqis, Cubans, Indians, etc., etc.  Please don&rsquo;t take money from my family to satisfy your selfish need to feel fullfilled.    </p>

			<p>The good part about this analysis is that most of the line items are sourced from CNN   &mdash;   can&rsquo;t dismiss those as items of right-wing propaganda.</p>
<p>I wonder what the cost is if you include legal immigrants and the Latino/Chicano population of America in general.</p>

			<p>Not surprising. As I&rsquo;ve said before, I live in texas on the front line of the invasion and we are cutting all sorts of social services for americans as well as raising taxes in order to pay for all of these mexicans. Not a week goes by where someone isn&rsquo;t somebody injured or killed by a drunken mexican and often when a sex offender is on the loose, it&rsquo;s a mexican. I&rsquo;m not saying whites never commit crimes because they do, it&rsquo;s just much more prevelant among mexicans. In south texas, forget about getting a decent job or a state or government job unless you are hispanic and speak spanish.</p>

			<p>Number nine is easily offset by lower prices. As for the other things, one could easily say that those very illegal immigrants help lower the cost of living in lots of other ways too such as for housing(since many of them build houses since they are cheap labor). But, let&rsquo;s just discount that for a minute. Those other programs are there for people who are not illegal aliens. If that is the case, then the solution is to get rid of the sickness(the welfare/subsidies) and not necessarily the symptoms. Also, remember that even illegal aliens do pay taxes. Some are more indirect than others. You&rsquo;d easily notice this when you see them living in horrible conditions even when they are not living five or more to an apartment. However, I am concerned with the children of illegal aliens. They seem to think they are entitled to be equal to the rest of society just because they were born in America. These people need a dose of race-realism.</p>

			<p>Since 9/11,Bush has not secured our borders with troops. He has not arrested employers of illegal aliens. He has not enforced our laws. Even today, there is only token enforcement and the illegal aliens continue to cross our borders in huge numbers.</p>
<p>Bush&rsquo;s lackey, Michael Chertoff, supplies only window dressing! Cotton candy law enforcement! They rarely arrest the employers of illegals. Why won&rsquo;t Chertoff go after Hormel, Tyson, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, construction companies and fast food outlets? Short answer: George W. Bush.</p>
<p>If Bush had been doing his job in 2001, we would not be in this national nightmare where Mexicans laugh at our laws. If he would start doing his job today like Dwight D. Eisenhower did in 1954, we would stop this invasion. SO simple. Enforce our laws!</p>

			<p>Someone once wrote to me that illegal immigrants are taking back the land that we took during the Mexican American war.</p>
<p>I wrote something along the lines of this in response:<br>
&#8220;You are referrring to how the U. S. took, by military force, California and New mexico form Mexico?</p>
<p>Why do you refer to this, and then refer to illegal immigrants? Are you implying that they are currently acting on military force, and taking back their land?</p>
<p>If so, then according to the Geneva Convention, they are non-uniformed combatants, and can be executed.</p>
<p>Just thought you should you should know.&#8221;</p>

			<p>One thing left out of the article is how illegals plan to chop off a large chunk of the US and turn it into their own country, ethnically cleansing whites, blacks and asians from the area, in the process.  They are quite vocal about their violent intentions and they definitely are so large in number that no police force could ever address the issue when they decide to implement their plan.  We are close to civil war in the US.  One has to ask how many more illegals before that war starts.</p>
<p>Not many, I think.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We are rats on a treadmill, running as fast as we can to provide money to support the children of Mexicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly how I feel.  I have two wonderful kids.  <br>
They get straight A&rsquo;s, go to church, have never been in trouble, and are polite and well-behaved.  They will grow up to contribute to our society.  My wife and I would love to have more children, but we simply cannot afford it   &mdash;   we cannot afford to lose my wife&rsquo;s salary.  The government takes about 45% of all of our income (in one way or another), and redistributes my family&rsquo;s earnings to illegal immigrants and their children.  </p>
<p>The end result is that American Citizens are manipulated to have fewer children, so that Mrs. Gonzalez next door can have 6 children - which my family is forced to pay for.  Meanwhile or leaders tell us that we need to import more foreigners because &#8220;birthrates among USA Citizens are falling.&#8221;  </p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the savings from using illegal labor and cheap foreign labor are NOT being passed down to the consumer. Take running shoes as an example. These are all made in China these days, probably for a few dollars a pair, but they are still selling for around $100 here in the states. As for housing, my impression is that the costs keep rising while the quality of construction keeps declining. Food costs are going up. Cheap consumer electronics aren&rsquo;t all that cheap. The list goes on and on. Meanwhile, the taxpayer is being screwed from every direction, but that&rsquo;s the American Way. </p>

			<p>Lower wages for illegal aliens does not mean that goods/services cost less, Gaurav. Say you&rsquo;re an employee of mine picking strawberries in a field for $12/hour. Three illegal aliens come up to me and say they will work for $2/hour. I can just fire you, hire three times the labor at half the cost, and pocket the difference. The price of the strawberries remains the same, but with the money I save hiring aliens, I can buy myself a Cadillac by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>Very good post, Publius!</p>
<p>Prices are not determined by the cost of production. No matter what they pay the pickers of fruit and vegetables, the prices in the grocery and at the wholesale level are determined by DEMAND.</p>
<p>Should it get to the point that it costs more to produce something (or pick something) than it can be sold for (the price), then that item will simply cease production and will no longer be offered for sale.</p>
<p>Cheap labor does not make for cheaper goods. Cheap labor simply means more profit for the producer and THAT boys and girls is why the exploiters are willing to go to great lengths to protect the modern version of slavery. It is also the reason why so many Americans have been replaced by illegal aliens. It is also the reason why so many jobs have been exported, outsourced, and off-shored&hellip;&hellip;PROFIT. In the past, American industry and workers were protected by import tarrifs and restrictions on (legal) immigration. Take that protection away and you get job losses and worker replacement.</p>
<p>Love of money is the root of all evil. Has it ever been any different?</p>

			<p>&#8220;As for the other things, one could easily say that those very illegal immigrants help lower the cost of living in lots of other ways too such as for housing(since many of them build houses since they are cheap labor).&#8221;</p>
<p>Illegals do not lower the cost of housing because they are cheap construction workers.  They actually raise the cost of housing because:</p>
<p>(1) Increase in population means more people for existing housing. Rents always rise when population increases. Always.</p>
<p>(2) Illegals crowd into housing. 10 working adults and 10 kids on welfare and food stamps is a common illegal household.  If each adult pays say, 300 permonth for rent, that means that the illegal household can easily afford 3,000 rent per month.  How many single income Americans can affort 3,000 rent per month?</p>
<p>(3) Since Janet Reno decreed that banks had to give loans to unqualified minorities,  the cost of buying houses has risen a lot.  Normally, when there is a mass influx of poor people, the cost of housing goes down.  But the mass influx of poor people with the Janet Reno mortgages kept the cost of new homes artifically high.</p>
<p>And remember, it was all done by crooked Mexican immigrant loan brokers and bankers who sold the loans as soon as they made them.</p>
<p>During the depression, as incomes plunged, the cost of housig fell in tandem with incomes.  But with Janet REno&rsquo;s bogus mortages for miniorities, people so poor they could not even qualify for a 1 bedroom apt were able to buy 4 bedroom, 3,000 SQ ft houses.</p>
<p>A massive influx of illegals raises housing costs.</p>

			<p>Interesting the GOP has illegal immigration as 3rd issue and the Dems have the ECONOMY as the big issue. The dems never get far enough to discover the economy is overcome with immigrants.  They invite more for votes.  The economy/border/compromised enforcement agencies are broken for many reasons but entitlements to illegal immigrants is big reason why USA has economic problems. I refer to data from WSJ (usually gov sourced).  It is revealing that Feds never use the data to help USA taxpayers discover WHERE our money is being wasted.  Government never admits or corrects policy mistakes, it just keeps taxing US out of our homes, jobs and even our estates when we die!     V</p>

			<p>I haven&rsquo;t the slightest problem believing these statistics. What other reason can account for the fact that thousands upon thousands of illegal aliens are driving expensive cars, living in expensive homes, and wearing expensive clothes and eating in expensive places. I don&rsquo;t know about other states, but that&rsquo;s what you can see in California. All of this doesn&rsquo;t even include the billions they supposedly send back to their home countries. How can all of this be? </p>
<p>Answer: Massive taxpayer supported services of every imaginable kind,from free dental and medical to special rates on all utilitiy bills, to free food and education. Most of this is really just plain fraud. It has never had the explicit consent of the American taxpayer public. Where&rsquo;s the mystery?</p>

			<p>It is true that a business can save money by firing American workers and hiring illegals.  But in the end, that is a recipe for national disaster.  In many cases, the illegals get paid under the table, and thus don&rsquo;t pay taxes.  So those of us who are still employed are taxed at a higher rate to pay for all the social costs of the illegals and their children.  Yes, we save 5 cents/apple at the store, or 50 cents at a restaurant, because illegals picked the fruit or washed the dishes, but we pay thousands of Dollars more in taxes to pay for their medical bills, welfare, police, jails, education of their kids, etc., and we will continue to pay for generations, because many will never make it to middle class.</p>
<p>Also, because they send their earnings home to Mexico, their wages don&rsquo;t improve our local or national economies.  Finally in the end, the increased ethnic diversity pulls our nation apart. Once our nation is composed of squabbling ethnic tribes, there will be no loyalty to the USA.  </p>
<p>It is all based on selfish greed.  The agriculture, construction, and meat packing industries want more money, and they don&rsquo;t give a @#$% about you or the future of the nation.</p>

<p>Perfect, I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote something along the lines of this in response:<br>
&ldquo;You are referrring to how the U. S. took, by military force, California and New mexico form Mexico?&#8221;</p>
<p>These belonged to Spain first and Mexico claimed then briefly when they fought against Spain and won. So if it is going to go back to anyone, then is should be either the native americans or the spanish. Anyway, the mexicans who lived in california and new mexico were never evicted,they stayed and their decendents live there today. Illegal alien mexicans were not from these areas nor were their ancestors.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a news flash for all readers:</p>
<p>Our &#8220;honorable&#8221; Congressmen and Senators are nothing but COMMON WHORES SELLING THEIR SERVICES (AND VOTES) to the corporate and business entities, and to the special interest lobbying groups!</p>
<p>Other than Ron Paul and perhaps one or two others, you&rsquo;d be hard-put to identify a TRULY HONEST politician in our Congress!</p>
<p>None of those &#8220;honorable&#8221; government leaders give a fig about what the American citizens want. Senators and Congressmen are literally &#8220;owned&#8221; by the special interests. Rember that speech by Pelosi promising to &#8220;clean up&#8221; the Congress. Judge for yourself how well this Whore cleaned up. McCain is whoring for the growers in Arizona and the other states. Corporations shoveling big bucks into his campaign warchest. Ditto for Lying Hillary and Phony Obama.</p>

<p>International law never recognized Spain&rsquo;s bogus claims in the New World.  Planting a flag in the ground and claiming that soil for Spain just didn&rsquo;t cut it.  Land is acquired through conquest and treaty and the Spaniards did neither in what later became the USA&hellip;              </p>

			<p>Something to keep in mind, friends:</p>
<p>We American citizens and voters are expected to not only subsidize the illegal (and legal) immigrants in every which possible way. But we also are expected to silently endure the crime wave and the endless social problems brought by immigrants. WHY? Because Mr. Fatwallet, CEO for the XYZ corporation, or Mr. Moneybags, owner of the ACB Business can get EVEN RICHER by replacing decent American workers with cheaper immigrant labor! </p>
<p>But THAT part of the immigration picture is studiously ignored by our Congressional Whores. Instead they prattle their endless lies about companies not being able to fill those jobs   &mdash;   that Americans won&rsquo;t take them! Or, like McCain, our presidential wanna-be, spout sanctimonious drivel about all being &#8220;God&rsquo;s children&#8221; and we Americans have to take care of them and their needs.</p>
<p>The bottom line seems to be that, WE, THE PEOPLE, do not deserve to be heard by our government leaders.  That our will, our wishes are brushed aside in favor of the businessmen&rsquo;s and corporate heads&rsquo; desire for cheap labor.<br>

			<p>It is not just illegal but also legal immigrants. The idiots in our gov&rsquo;t just can&rsquo;t seem to bring in enough uneducated idots with diametrically opposed cultural values to Americans. There is NO value to the American people whatsoever in importing some immigrant from some obscure tribe who has never seen a toilet (or a 2-story building) that does not speak English while dropping them in the middle of white America. Only 1 outcome from that. WELFARE and a drag on our dwindling resources. I guess it makes the libs and pols feel good. Think I&rsquo;m kidding? I read about an african with 9 children who came on a visa lottery. Speaks only some tribal language so the people of CT had to hire an interpreter and provide welfare for him. I mean come on. How in the world could the guy ever be expected to support his family here. If we are going to have mass legal immigration, at least make it people who may add value to the economy. Better yet, restrict immigraiton to white countries only. History has proven it works very well. Importing from every culture in teh world will only lead to eventual balkanization.</p>
