						<p>Long-distance telephone marriages can be dialled up under sharia law and then used to sponsor loved ones into Canada, Muslim leaders say.</p>
<p>Two Muslim leaders have told the Toronto Sun telephone marriages are permissible under Islamic law and require two witnesses and imams here and abroad to conduct the vows, which may have the bride in Pakistan and the groom in Toronto.</p>
<p>Once completed, a marriage certificate is obtained abroad legitimately in Muslim countries and can be used by the groom for sponsoring his new wife to Canada, one Mississauga imam said.</p>
<p>Mumtaz Ali, of the Canadian Association of Muslims, said he conducted a telephone marriage between a student in Toronto and his about-to-be wife in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a university student and couldn&rsquo;t leave,&#8221; Ali said. &#8220;It is a civil contract and the vows were conducted over the phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>A marriage certificate was obtained and the student was able to sponsor his wife to Canada, he said.</p>
<p>The vow takes less than five minutes and a dowry is exchanged to seal the ceremony, Ali said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;NOT WIDESPREAD&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;These telephone marriages are taking place but are not widespread,&#8221; said the former lawyer for the Ontario attorney-general&rsquo;s office. &#8220;The parties must know each other and have developed a relationship. Most of the times the couple have been introduced by family members,&#8221; Ali said. &#8220;In many cases one person may not be able to leave the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imam Sayyid Muhammad Rizvi, of Ja&rsquo;ffari Islamic Centre, in Toronto, said: &#8220;These marriages are perfectly acceptable under sharia law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the marriage certificate is taken to the Canadian embassy where it is recognized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immigration spokesman Karen Shadd-Evelyn said her officials are aware of the telephone marriages.</p>
<p>&#8220;In spousal sponsorship applications, the validity of all marriages is evaluated,&#8221; Shadd-Evelyn said. &#8220;It is incumbent on the applicant to prove the relationship was not entered into to benefit from immigration.&#8221;<br>

<p>Oh really! How about politicians and politically-correct bureaucrats develop some backbone and stop capitulating to sharia &#8220;laws&#8221; that have no place in Canada.   </p>
<p>More to the point&hellip;it is &#8220;incumbent&#8221; on Canadian bureaucrats to play ball for the home team and look after our OWN interests before &#8220;throwing&#8221; the game to your opponents. </p>
<p>They threw another &#8216;sucker ball&rsquo; as in baseball   &mdash;   and you&rsquo;re about to strike out in this game.<br>

			<p>Their religion gives a wholehearted blessing to marriage made over the telephone, and yet after 300 years still none of them will marry a white man. I would point out that the telephone was probably invented by a white man, but, doing so might put another 300 year delay on things.  </p>

			<p>Immigration spokes&#8221;man&#8221; Karen Shadd-Evelyn is aware of these telephone marriges and will rubber stamp them, allowing the &#8220;spouse&#8221; into Canada, along with the &#8220;spouse&rsquo;s&#8221; mother, father,sisters,brothers, innummerable cousins, and their cousins cousins. It dosent matter that sharia law was rejected in Canada. It dosent matter what the majority of Canadians think. It dosent matter that non-muslim &#8220;marriges&#8221; that were conducted over the phones would be rejected on sight. What matters to the Canadian goverment is the destruction of it&rsquo;s White/Christian heritage and the Church of multiculturalism- the weapon used to attain that goal. The ultimate aim is a balkanized country with no majority, and no majority culture. The cultural Marxists and their toady politicians know this is the road to perpetual power.</p>

			<p>  I recall an number of years ago, possibly in the early 1990&rsquo;s,  when I read an article in «The Toronto Star,»  an utterly wretched newspaper,  concerning just such an «nuptial» conducted by telephone between an putative «bride» in Toronto,  and an groom in India.</p>
<p>  Even «The Star» which has done more that it&rsquo;s share of «immigrant mongering» over the past 30 years, expressed some reservation concerning the validity,  not only of the marriage,  but the procedure per which it was effected.</p>
<p>  An portion of the article concerned an brief discussion of the matter with an «Canadian Immigration Official.» This individual, who was never identified,  agreed that the procedure was highly irregular. But nevertheless stated that the matter in this instance was exceptional,  and would not become routine. And that the Candian government expected «Canadian citizens» to marry in Canada.  Not by telephone.  It is apparent that the position of the Canadian government has «evolved» substantially since this «one time only» occurrence.</p>

			<p>Kanada is suffering the same fate and Europe, Australia and the United States.</p>
<p>I must say it annoys me just a little bit that the muslim, paki, indian and asian are able to laugh in my face as they make jokes about me in their language.</p>
<p>Thanks to Trudeau, Mulroney, Chretien and a few others in-between that have allowed and supported the mass immigration of undesirable trash that leads us to third world status.</p>
<p>Did you ever notice that most retail gas pumps are now run by visible foreigners?  Nice to have your fuel supply controlled by those that hate you and are bent on your destruction.</p>
<p>Big business and corrupt politicians successful recipee for your destruction.</p>
