<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Of all the ways in which a nation defines itself, few are more important than what it teaches its children about itself. In the history classes of its public schools, a nation retells its own story and instills a national identity in the minds of young citizens. In today&rsquo;s America, where competing racial, cultural, and linguistic claims now make it nearly impossible even to speak of national identity, questions about history have become a struggle for the possession of America&rsquo;s past.</p>
<p>The multicultural, multiperspective history that has arisen from this struggle is not merely a departure from the history America has always taught its children. It may be the first time that a nation has abandoned the single identity of its origins and set out deliberately to adopt multiple national identities.</p>
<p>Significantly, the understanding by many non-whites of multicultural history is entirely different from that of whites. For whites, the central concepts are &#8220;inclusion&#8221; and &#8220;pluralism.&#8221; American history is to be rewritten so that racial and cultural perspectives that were once &#8220;ignored&#8221; or &#8220;neglected&#8221; will get equal treatment. For many non-whites, however, multicultural history is merely a step on the way to an explicitly racial, Afro-centric or Hispanic history. Their goal is separation rather than inclusion.</p>
<p>The &#8220;conservative&#8221; view is that explicitly racial histories are illegitimate. America, it is argued, must be united by a common history, and exclusionist histories will disunite us. This position is logically correct; exclusionist histories are divisive. But as we shall see, the &#8220;conservative&#8221; position is wrong &mdash; practically, emotionally, and even morally. America is <em>already</em> disunited by race, and no approach to history can change that. Just as it would be impossible to use the same history book in both France and England, it is impossible to write a single American history that satisfies, white, black, Indian, Hispanic, and Asian.</p>
<p><b>Schooling as Assimilation</b></p>
<p>The purpose of American public education has never been simply to impart knowledge. One of its central goals has been to make children into Americans. American schools fly the American flag and students pledge allegiance to it. The central events of history are from the American past. The most glorious achievements are American achievements. There is nothing odd about that. Every nation gives its children a national education.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, American schools have had an even more explicitly nation-building purpose than others because of the need to assimilate immigrants. John Quincy Adams wrote that immigrants &#8220;must cast off their European skin, never to resume it.&#8221; Horace Mann argued that &#8220;a foreign people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cannot be transformed into the full stature of American citizens merely by a voyage across the Atlantic.&#8221; One of the strongest motives for building public schools was, therefore, the need to make <em>Americans</em> out of Europeans.</p>
<p>Europeans weren&rsquo;t going to be made into Americans by teaching them about the contributions of Africans, Mexicans and Indians. The old, standard history united Americans because it had a coherent purpose and a single voice. It emphasized one point of view and ignored others. To put it bluntly, it was history about white people for white people.</p>
<p>This history served the country well, so long as the population was overwhelmingly white, and the two traditional minorities &mdash; blacks and Indians &mdash; did not have voices. All this changed, beginning in the 1960s. The civil rights movement gave voices to blacks and Indians, and changes in immigration laws brought a massive influx of non-whites. It was the end of a certain kind of America.</p>
<p>History has winners and losers, and they see the same events with different eyes.</p>
<p>Non-whites began to complain about a version of history that left them out. The nation-building history that had bound Europeans into a single people had not bound whites and non-whites into a single people. &#8220;Multicultural&#8221; history was therefore to be a broader, more inclusive history that would give every American his rightful share of America&rsquo;s past. At the same time, &#8220;culturally relevant&#8221; history would keep blacks and Hispanics in school and stop them from dropping out at ever-increasing rates.</p>
<p><b>Squaring the Circle</b></p>
<p>Something that well-meaning whites did not understand is that an &#8220;inclusive&#8221; history &mdash; one that would be all things to all people &mdash; is impossible. History has winners and losers, and they see the same events with different eyes. At the same time, virtually every non-white group sees the conflicts of the past as struggles with whites, so multicultural history becomes a collection of perspectives that are often not merely non-white but anti-white.</p>
<p>How, for example, is a multicultural history to treat the discovery and settlement of North America by Europeans? The old history called it a triumphant advance for civilization. But for Indians, the same historical events are an unending sequence of defeats and disasters. Does a multicultural textbook call this a triumph or a disaster or both or neither?</p>
<p>What about the Spanish-American War? At the time, it was thought a glorious success because it added huge chunks to the American West. But was it instead, an imperialist atrocity? Are today&rsquo;s school children to rejoice that California is part of America or are they to weep over the stolen birthright of their Hispanic brothers?</p>
<p>Slavery poses a similar riddle. Blacks want to make it the centerpiece of their history, and in many ways it is. For nearly 300 years, most American blacks were slaves, and virtually everything that blacks did or thought was circumscribed by slavery. Today, it is still the centerpiece of black history, because it excuses failure and can be used to extract benefits from whites.</p>
<p>For whites, though, slavery is a minor historical event. Except for the Civil War (which was set in motion and fought by whites) the course of the nation&rsquo;s history would hardly have been different if there had been no slavery. To give it a prominent place in white history is a transparent effort to manipulate the way that whites think about the present.</p>
<p>Once slavery is promoted to the status of unparalleled evil, much of the past becomes incomprehensible. Is George Washington <b>both</b> the Father of his Country <b>and</b> a wicked man because he owned slaves? Is Abraham Lincoln the storied savior of the Union or is he a fiend because he thought blacks were inferior and should be sent back to Africa?</p>
<p>Those of us who went to school when American history still had coherence are likely to learn about the new, multicultural history only by accident. One such accident is that this year is the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America. A typical multicultural problem has thus spilled out of the classroom and gotten wider notice: Was Columbus a great explorer or was he a genocidal tyrant? Are we to celebrate half a millennium of European America or are we to hang our heads in shame? Or are we to do both?</p>
<p><b>Problems and Uncertainties</b></p>
<p>Multicultural histories, by their very nature, cannot answer these questions. And because they cannot, they present American history as a bundle of uncertainties, as a series of unsolved &#8220;problems.&#8221; Unlike the old history, which viewed the past with pride and the future with confidence, multicultural histories are diffident and perplexed. Unlike the old history, which at least gave white children a firm foundation for national identity, multicultural history says, in effect, that America has no identity. The only thing left to unite a multicultural America is geography.</p>
<p>One way to understand the impossible task that multicultural history has set itself is to imagine how one would write a school history book to be used in both France and Britain. How would it treat Napoleon? The very geography of London &mdash; Waterloo Station, Trafalger Square &mdash; is a monument to Englishmen who killed Frenchmen. Napoleon&rsquo;s tomb, Austerlitz station, and street names like Jena and Ulm all mark the pride the French take in their ancestors&rsquo; readiness to slaughter foreigners. A &#8220;multicultural&#8221; history book of the Napoleonic wars would be an absurdity, and everyone knows it. And yet, it would be no more absurd than the history books American children use today.</p>
<p>Non-whites have a much keener sense of their group interests than whites. They see very clearly that the future will have its winners and losers, just as history had them. Thus, while virtually every school district with a white majority is trying to square the circle by teaching a history that is everything to everyone, school districts with black majorities are beginning to replace the old &#8220;Euro-centric&#8221; curriculum with one that is openly &#8220;Afro-centric.&#8221; They are not interested in supplementing the traditional history with different points of view. They want a single, African point of view.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, where 92 percent of the public school students are black, history and social studies courses have been rewritten from an &#8220;African-American&#8221; perspective. New York&rsquo;s public schools recently authorized a curriculum revision based on an openly anti-white position paper drafted, in part, by the black-supremacist professor, Leonard Jeffries (see <a href="/ar/1991/10/index.html#article1" target="October91" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none">AR, October, 1991</a>). In California, school districts in heavily-black Oakland and East Palo Alto started the 1991/1992 school year <em>without social studies textbooks.</em> They decided to develop their own black-centered materials because they could find nothing suitable.</p>
<p>Private black schools have gone the farthest. Some reject America, and teach their pupils that they are the African diaspora. Many teach patent nonsense, claiming that the ancient Egyptians and even King Solomon were black. Nevertheless, even if some of their material is ridiculous, Afro-centric teachers have recognized something that white teachers have forgotten: History has a point of view; it cannot be all things to all people.</p>
<p><b>Building a Nation</b></p>
<p>Blacks, then, are learning the kind of history that whites once learned &mdash; a history that builds identity and certitude. White children are learning that every interpretation is valid, that nothing is certain, that their nation&rsquo;s past is all paradoxes and unsolved problems. Patriotism will not grow in the heart of a child who cannot look back with pride upon his nation&rsquo;s past. We have come a long way from schooling that made Europeans into Americans. We now make Americans into nothing at all.</p>
<p>Multicultural history is like affirmative action. Just as whites are to step aside to give hiring preferences to minorities, whites are to set aside their own point of view and study those of others. Non-whites, on the other hand, are free to promote their own interests and exclusionist histories.</p>
<p>Like affirmative action, multicultural history is possible only because the majority has abandoned its position at the center. If whites insisted on their own history as strongly as non-whites insist on theirs, the inevitability of separate histories would have been recognized long ago. Nor will whites be willing to forego their own history for ever. They will eventually realize that only they are studying a past with no answers and no certainties. They will eventually see that there <b>cannot</b> be one history that satisfies all. And they will begin to wonder whether there can be one nation that satisfies all.</p>

			<p>The article states that: &#8220;Patriotism will not grow in the heart of a child who cannot look back with pride upon his nation&rsquo;s past.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Yes, this is a very important outcome of multiculturalism.  Whether a planned or unplanned consequence of multiculturalism, the end result is perpetually squabbling ethnic groups, and no loyalty to the center (to the Nation).  Why should I pay taxes, contribute to charities, participate in civic activities, or serve in a National army in order to benefit a different ethnic group, which hates my group?  This is how you defeat and destroy a nation.  </p>
<p>In addition, a homogeneous nation can focus on productivity.  In a multicultural nation, efficiency is greatly reduced, because (1) everyone has a different agenda and (2) people and organizations waste their time fighting for their piece of the pie. An example is shown by the fact that in the USA, every large company, university, and government agency must employ an army of Affirmative Action  Officers, who not only do not produce anything, but actually reduce the productivity of others.     </p>

			<p>&#8220;They will eventually see that there cannot be one history that satisfies all. And they will begin to wonder whether there can be one nation that satisfies all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t hold my breath.  We live in a nation where mediocrity is celebrated and all of our great leaders, inventors, the movers and shakers of society, take a back seat to the likes of Martin Luther King and Co.  Anything that White Americans (if White Americans are still around) have done or ever will do, no matter how great, will pale in comparison.  Be it a cheap alternative fuel, nanotechnology, he** even a matter transporter, it is nothing compared to that greasy black man marching through the streets of Memphis agitating for &#8220;civil rights&#8221;.    </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really painful for me to watch this decay going on in a country I used to love.  As soon as my son graduates from High School and off to college, my wife and I are moving to Spain to retire.  She has Spanish citizenship and her family owns a villa near the coast.  I wish all of you well on here and hope that someday America manages to get itself back on track.          <br>

<p>This is appropriately spot-on bizarre, declaring pro-minority/anti-white textbooks &#8216;racist&rsquo; and in need of changes. This is exactly the kind of thing liberal America has been up to for quite some now. Or has this Always been going on, and we just started noticing in the last decade or so?</p>

<p>I think Mr. Taylor means the Mexican-American War. The Spanish-American War was fought in 1898. We liberated Cuba, gained the Philippines, Guam &amp; Puerto Rico, &amp; annexed the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>I feel no guilt over the annexation of northern Mexico as a result of the Mexican-American War. We only gained 80-90 thousand &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; in that war &amp; many were Indians who were counted as Mexican citizens becaused they were taxed by Mexico. 99% of Hispanics in the Southwest are descended from immigrants who settled there after the US annexed it, most coming in the last 40-years. What bothers me is after conquering &amp; developing this region we are giving it up with a shot being fired.</p>

			<p>Multicultural nations are impossible for more prosaic reasons than those that Mr. Jared Taylor indicated in his otherwise insightful and truthful article.</p>
<p>Most of racial groups forms ad-hoc aliances against other racial groups. They usually do so solely because of visible anthropological features that distinguish their group from others and not because some races are superior while some other are not.</p>
<p>Here is a link to an article that explains this missing element in Mr. Tylor&rsquo;s analysis.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s difficult enough to incorporate blacks into our history let alone Asians and Hispanics.  What else is there to talk about except slavery, the Civil War and the 60s?  Then 40 years of nothing since.  Plenty of things to talk about but nothing that would portray them as positive or productive members of society.  </p>

			<p>Fine article.  </p>
<p>After reading it I realized again how torn I&rsquo;ve been for years over the fate of my country.</p>
<p>Growing up poor, but educated, I was able to make the most out of the little I started with(and I&rsquo;m sure Race played a part, ie; it doesn&rsquo;t ALWAYS work against us).</p>
<p>But it took a while.  My classmates were mostly Black.  Later after college (being lectured to by rich Whites) my workmates were mostly Black and Hispanic.  </p>
<p>I had one too many close calls with Blacks and Hispanics, mostly Blacks, and my girlfriends too.  It got to be too much. And just when I thought I was going to just lose it an opportunity came to move abroad and I did.</p>
<p>I have to say this&hellip;there were people in my family who either refused to believe Race had any influence on my decision to leave (it wasn&rsquo;t the only reason, but it was a big one, because the country where I am now is mostly White) or just ignored the issue.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s an interesting (but to my pov not at all surprising) development of late.  Now that more time has passed, and as many have predicted, things have gotten worse between the Races, not just Black and White, some people in my family have come to realize what it was like for me and are also very concerned for their children, who are now growing up fast.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually expressing interests in going to places that are predominantly White (not a lot of choices, but there&rsquo;s still some).  </p>
<p>I guess one could go on, but the point is that things ARE changing. Perhaps not fast enough for some, but they are.  I guess how you look at it depends on your disposition, ie; is the glass half empty or full.  </p>
<p>For me, I think sites like this are great and that more Whites are going to shake the whole &#8220;taboo&#8221; thing so many Whites feel about the issue of Race and start to move in the direction of Race Realism.  </p>
<p>Obviously I&rsquo;m hoping so.</p>

<p>You know, I&rsquo;m starting to think this is the only solution. Whites are already second class citizens and things are getting worse. Far from fighting back, most of us just bend over and take it. Better to go to a place where whites are respected and admired, even if we are foreigners and minorities, than to stay in a place where we are robbed, raped and murdered because of our skin color and then called racist if we notice or talk back. I&rsquo;m looking at Latin America or Southeast Asia. The U.S. is no place for a white man. </p>

			<p>CIVILIZATION was introduced to this country. History can&rsquo;t be re-written - IT IS WHAT IT IS.</p>
<p>To interject personal and emotional opinions as fact are no more than a commentary to the real facts.</p>
<p>Stray from the facts - crumble in the ruins.</p>

<p>The statement, above, rings true for me.  When I was young, I loved America and was willing to serve, sacrifice and die for this nation.  However, I am not willing to die for Somalians, Mexicans, Nigerians, Iraqis, Cubans, Indians, Pakistanis etc., etc., etc.  My family will immigrate to Australia.  </p>

			<p>Look around you and see what&rsquo;s going on.  Our politicians are less intelligent and of lower calibre than even a decade ago.  Our schools are indoctrination centers where my kids correct me if I say &#8220;Indian&#8221; instead of &#8220;Native American&#8221;.  I&rsquo;d like to set them straight but at their young age they would just be targets for harrassment from the thought police and the other students.  I live in a small town in a county in an overwhelmingly White state.  I&rsquo;ve lived here for about a year and in that short time I&rsquo;ve seen 4 mixed race children.  Quite amazing given the fact that it was extraordinarily  rare in these kinds of places not too long ago.  </p>

			<p>One of our very best former presidents once said <br>
&#8220;The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities.&#8221;<br>
Teddy Roosevelt was a very far-seeing, enlightened man.<br>
When I consider the choice given us in the upcoming election, I can only wish that we had a potential candidate like him now.<br>
Sadly, as in the case of Ron Paul, most Americans today are such sheeple, they wouldn&rsquo;t even consider him.</p>

<p>I apologize in advance if this offends, for it is not meant to. But, it is comments like these that are symptomatic of why the Euro-Americans will lose if they do not alter their frame of refernce(s). Don&rsquo;t you realize that defecting to a foreign country is exactly what the racially awake on th other side want? Someone once said that &#8220;The best way is never the easiest way.&#8221; And if you think leaving this European built country is the best way, I would then say unto you that &#8220;you are wrong, sir.&#8221; It is my estimation that the American Economy, and perhaps the Global Economy, is at a tipping-point. Look at what happened to the Foreign Markets two weeks ago. If there is enough political and social unrest, you just might see the stage set for true &#8220;Change&#8221; to take place. Hold onto your butts, I have a feeling we&rsquo;re in for a wild ride. May God keep you and hold you in the palm of his hand. In nomine Patris et Filius Sancti et Spiritus Sanctus. Amen.<br>

			<p>Christian&rsquo;s, so called &#8221; guilt &#8221; or lack of knowledge of the true tenets of their religion, has caused this acceptance of non-constitutional laws, racial double-standards, lack of self-preservation,accepting miscegenation=genocide(reversing God&rsquo;s biological genetic &#8220;blue print&#8221;). Marx and Engels was not the second coming of Our Lord Jesus, The Christ. There is a big difference between wealth being voluntarilly being shared versus forcibly stealing one&rsquo;s wealth and redistributing these largesse to unappreciative demanding people.</p>

			<p>Phather Phalon I hope your right but my wife and I are in our late 50s and we&rsquo;re from another time that we miss terribly.  Whites seem to be stuck in suicide mode.  Women giving birth or adopting mixed race children.  Politicians pandering to minorities knowing full well they&rsquo;ll be kicked out of office and replaced when their numbers are large enough.  Cutting out our own highly skilled people from jobs and replacing them with<br>
mediocre applicants to fill race quotas.  Same with colleges. We&rsquo;ve lost a great deal of our freedom in accomodating these people.  I&rsquo;m not an intellectual and this whole thing is mind boggling to me.  I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because of class warfare between rich Whites and poor Whites or if it&rsquo;s a struggle between feminists and the male dominated society or some other reason.  I do know we&rsquo;re doing it to ourselves whatever the cause.  Spain has it&rsquo;s own problems but nothing like what is going on in this once great country.  </p>

			<p>No more attacks on Christianity please Michigan Patriot.  The same so called Christians who harbor illegal aliens and relocate African refugees in the US are the same people who push for universal religion and gay clergy.  They&rsquo;re Marxists hiding under the facade of religion.  We&rsquo;re in this mess because people aren&rsquo;t adhering to their faith.  Laziness, greed, loss of family values, abortion on demand, etc.   </p>

			<p>There might have been a chance of blacks making a niche for themselves in this country at one time. That went by the boards, once they took up with W.E.B. DeBoise and the NAACP. If blacks had stayed with the ideas of Booker T. Washington and just went about their business quietly, I think they&rsquo;d have been alright.<br>
They weren&rsquo;t doing great in the late 19th and early 20th century, but they were improving slowly. They couldn&rsquo;t maintain it and went for the big &#8220;victory,&#8221; which they supposed was political muscle. Well, they found out that political pull can do a lot, but it can&rsquo;t legislate success in life. So here they are all these years later and basically, they&rsquo;re still at square one. I think it&rsquo;s extremely doubtful that they can ever regain what the ground they&rsquo;ve lost at this point. They&rsquo;re just being blown along like a leaf in a gale without any direction and far worse off than they&rsquo;ve ever been in this country. Even worse off th an when they were slaves I think. Too bad.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a Canadian Catholic high school student and I can gratefully say that our history class is heavily Eurocentric. In grade 9, we started out with the Greeks, Romans, and feudalism. Grade 10, we took a look at the Middle Ages, Renaissance, the formation of Protestant churches, the Louis&rsquo;(XV, XIV, XVIII), the Reign of terror, Napoleon, and the Industrial revolution. Now, in grade 11, we are learning about the major wars (which, of course, involved mostly Europeans and North Americans). In grade 12 we will be learning about Canadian (and a bit of American) history.</p>

			<p>History is a complex thing and post-modernism inevitably complicates it still further. To me, the danger is not that our culture is no longer drawing it&rsquo;s inspiration from west european males, but from no source at all. I attended supermajority black schools for my entire life, and it is not as though &#8220;white&#8221; culture is declining and minority culture is ascending. </p>
<p>Rather, both have fallen into a mutually reinforcing void. Whatever the official story may be, whites like the posters here blame almost all problems on minorities. Minorities are officially encouraged to do the same to whites, with predictably destructive results in both cases.</p>
<p>The same problems that affect black communities are beginning to affect white communities, not because of some dubious and sociologically ignorant fantasy of &#8220;cultural infection&#8221; but because both cultures are no longer able to pass on goals and values to the next generation in a meaningful way, and there&rsquo;s no single source of blame for that shortcoming.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s all irrelevant.  You can&rsquo;t stop the master plan, the new North America: Canada, US, Mexico.  They are to merge as one and join with the EU. Eventually there will be a global government which has a role for all of us (an inanimate role for most).  Immigration, fear of Islam, even global warming are all red herrings.  The Bildergerg group is the real enemy.  Watch endgame by Alex Jones on youtube, download it or buy it, copy it and pass it on.

<p>Phather, I try to remain positive about the outlook of this nation but the fact is the White population keeps declining every year and nothing is being done to secure the borders or reduce legal inflows into this country.  People are migrating from one end of the country to the other to escape it.  The Census Bureau announced it is expecting a huge increase in the number of retirees to the Rocky Mountain states.  Florida and Arizona have apparently lost their appeal.  Here&rsquo;s the thing, it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly easy to move outside of the country to live.  I&rsquo;ve been checking out some websites myself.  The cost of living is lower and you can get a nice piece of real estate in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, etc. for a fraction of what it costs to live in the US.  Living abroad will look increasingly more attractive to many of the 80,000,000 baby boomers in this country as the nation fills up with blacks and browns.  </p>

<p>&#8220;The best way is never the easy&#8221; is right.  Especially in this case.</p>
<p>But if things are going to work for us in the European-built USA then European-Americans are going to have to organize.  And we&rsquo;re not there yet.  </p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t sell White flight short.  Whites are the most adventurous racial group there is and have been traveling the globe longer than anyone.  Lots are going just to go.</p>
<p>But, if they are going so as to cut down on the odds of dying at the hands of a hostile enemy, like Blacks, Mexicans, Muslims, the New York Times, CNN, Columbia, Harvard, Yale Universities, George Bush, Hillary Clinton, and the NeoCons, then, hey, who are we to hold it against them?</p>

 I think it&rsquo;s interesting to read this, along with<br>
the recent USA Today article about polling among<br>
present-day high school students. They tell pollsters<br>
that, not only was ML King the most important figure<br>
in American history (other than presidents) but<br>
that Rosa Parks and Harriet Tubman were second<br>
and third!</p>
<p> This indoctrination is showing up in election<br>
results already, as Obama does vastly better among<br>
young whites than among older ones.</p>
<p> For the Clintons, who were responsible for much of<br>
this, it may be a case of he who lives by the sword<br>
dies by the sword.     </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a strong chance of a mass Exodus to counter the mass Immigration that seems to be working against our best interests, economicall, politically, etc, etc, in so many ways.</p>
<p>If that is the case, and things get bad sooner than later, there&rsquo;s no question that Argentina will top my list.  There&rsquo;s already people from the States there.  But that&rsquo;s for next time.   </p>

<p>I hear you.  It&rsquo;s all so sick and self destructive as to be beyond belief.  I know they don&rsquo;t care anything about these nonwhites.  They&rsquo;re just pawns in game of power to them.  A game it looks like they&rsquo;re losing control of.  It seems it&rsquo;s starting to backfire though with Hillary getting a taste of her own medicine in the Presidential campaign.  I&rsquo;m not quite at that point where I believe America is unsalvagable.  Another decade of this craziness we&rsquo;ve been seeing and I&rsquo;ll know for sure.  If at that point it looks hopeless, I might think about leaving too and urging other people also.  But before we leave, first we have to punish these people in power, the race mixers, the Asianphiles, the bleeding heart liberals.  It&rsquo;s easy for them to pander and spout platitudes about diversity as long as they can live in a majority White area.  I suggest the nuclear option.  We should go down to Haiti and adopt every child in sight and bring it back to the US.  After a few months turn it over to the state.  We could empty out their nurseries in a few months.  Don&rsquo;t stop at babies, get the teens and if you&rsquo;ve got the stomach for it, some arranged marriages to get them in the country. There are millions of orphans in Africa too.  If these so called liberals start taking notice of the black tidal wave, play their game and shout them down as racists. The goal here is to reduce their share of the population below 10 percent.  No voice in government, no power, nothing but harrassment and violence and payback for the destruction they&rsquo;ve brought on us.      </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure they are.  Salty is right.  An Argentine is not a light-skinned Mexican. Argentina considers itself a &#8220;European&#8221; country (whatever population statistics you may quote), and Argentinians will explicitly TELL you they are Europeans, if you make the mistake of calling them  &#8220;Latin Americans&#8221;.  I speak from experience.   In this, Argentina is more like the USA was prior to 1965 when we were not groveling and kowtowing and ashamed to be who we are.</p>
<p>Chile ditto.  There are other races there, and treated well, I believe.  Nonetheless, it is a WHITE country, without apologies.</p>

<p>If you are going to defect from the Unites States of Embarrassment then would please pick a proper country? Europe desperately needs to be repopulated by &#8220;Whites&#8221; of Anglo Saxon descent. </p>
<p>Also, it seems that certain people believe there is nothing they can do to change the conditions around themselves. The fact of the matter is, if you want to see change, then you must be the one to elicit change. Become the model. Be just and fear not. Pick a faction within our cause and stand your ground (legally). Sooner or later the light will shine so bright that the sleeping sheeple will have no choice but to awaken. And upon seeing the light, they shall come running with open arms to our brothers and sisters. The European Americans will be forced to choose tribes once it is clear the Hordes are doing the same. Have faith until you are certain there is no return. We must hold our government accountable. Take political action. Good luck and Godspeed.</p>

<p>You may have a point there.</p>
<p>But Whites are being squeezed right out of the picutre here.  They can deny it, or ignore it, all they want (though some don&rsquo;t even hide it), but the NWO gang have no real use for Whites anymore.  Well, White men.</p>
<p>Though I didn&rsquo;t stay long enough to give a firm thumbs up to Argentina, it was the best place I visited when I did an after college tour from Caracas, to the Andes in Peru, Brazil, Uruguay and then Argentina.  They are 50% Italian there.  Even their spanish sounds Neapolitano.  And the women are drop dead gorgeous, like nothing I&rsquo;ve seen anywhere, ever. Though not very approachable.  Also, while I was there I think I saw three black people, and actually met one.  He was from Ecuador.  He was a musican playing with some other guys from that country and they looked more Mexican.  We had a beer after their performance and sat around chatting.  They were friendly.  But aside from that, it was all White people.  </p>
<p>Also, the one guy posted some statistics about their being 78% Whites in Argentina.  Is that bad?  Right now there LESS than that in our own country, and even that number is dwindling in proportion to the growing number of immigrants.  </p>
<p>Tell ya what.  For me, the US as we&rsquo;ve known it growing up, is finished.  If Whites are not permitted to start our own country within the States then what are we to do.  But how is that going to happen when we can&rsquo;t even congregate without a problem?<br>
There&rsquo;s a major, major, transition happening, and people, White people, want it to be painless.  They are only fooling themselves.  But we can&rsquo;t get to them because they have closed themselves off behind an impenatrable wall of denial.<br>
It&rsquo;s going to crumble around them soon.  </p>
<p>Anyway, if there was a mass exodus to the South I think you might be right.  But if people drift in, slowly, over time, I don&rsquo;t think there would be a big to do about it.  But who knows?</p>

			<p>Anyone seriously interested in this subject and on the value of what different races/people groups have accomplished should read &#8220;In Defense Of Elitism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s basic but brilliant premise is this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people are better than others-smarter, harder working, more learned, more productive, harder to replace.&#8221; And these people are the ones who must be recognized, encouraged, and trained for positions of leadership in our society from an early age. Not to do so would be imprudent for society, and unjust to the talented. He is therefore a predictable and funny foe of the movement to stop ability tracking in public schools (the &#8220;theory&#8221; of this movement is that &#8220;bright children ought to be helping slow ones rather than maximizing their own achievements and pulling ahead.&#8221;) He notes a similar movement in games, whereby &#8220;an elementary school class is apt to be divided into so many teams that no one is the last chosen. Children are thus supposedly shielded from noticing who is better or worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tell me one European country that makes it easy for White Americans to immigrate to?  Unless you have family in the host country it&rsquo;s nearly impossible.  We could overstay our tourist visas but what would that get us?  None of these countries have birth citizenship anymore which means your children will be stateless.  Some of these countries have national ID cards.  There&rsquo;s also the high tax burden and unemployment rate.  Remember, the muslims are being subsidized by the government.  It seems to me that if Europe really wants White immigrants, they would make it easier for non EU members to enter their countries and provide some sort of temporary support structure for them. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s far easier to get into Australia and Argentina on a pensioner visa.  If you have a certain minimum source of income every month from your native country, they will allow you in  as long as you don&rsquo;t plan on working on the economy or taking state benefits.  Of course, most of the people applying for these would be probably be elderly.  What&rsquo;s wrong with Argentina by the way?  It&rsquo;s nonwhite population is about 3% (mestizos) and virtually no blacks.  It&rsquo;s Whiter than Canada and many Western European countries.  </p>

			<p>Justin,believe me,the UK is ten times worse than America.I live in Scotland and have seen a large increase in blacks over the last 5 years.About 10 years ago,if you saw a black person,they stuck out like a sore thumb,now they are everywhere and the amount of mixed race children has increased (white mothers giving birth to them,and white men,too).</p>
<p>If you are going to go to somewhere else in Europe,you are best avoiding Northern Europe,and going to Southern Europe,where whites aren&rsquo;t demonised.</p>

			<p>Phather, I think I&rsquo;ve done more than my share in taking up the cause.  Since 1994 when I first started noticing the changes going on around me, I&rsquo;ve been donating money to FAIR, VDARE, COFCC, CCIR, and the Minutemen.  I&rsquo;ve sent money to Tom Tancredo then Ron Paul.  My donations to Ron Paul have added up to nearly $500.00 over six months and I&rsquo;ve never donated money to election campaigns before.  During both amnesty debates I called both Senators and Representative each day for nearly a month.  I&rsquo;ve called my Representative dozens and dozens of times over the past couple of years about the illegal aliens in my area.  They gave me the number to ICE and I&rsquo;ve spoken to an agent three times about the problem.  I&rsquo;ve spoken to the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department who says they arrest them and end up releasing them because the ICE agents don&rsquo;t show up to take custody of them.  Guess what?  They&rsquo;re still here and selling drugs on the streets in my once quiet all American town.  </p>

<p>Oh, believe me Phather Phalon, I AM CERTAIN that America is already past the point of no return in its descent. You would reach the same conclusion if you&rsquo;d just use your eyes objectively. Nothing that Mr. Taylor says in this article is really false, but the main point that he doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand is that logic has BARELY EVER determined the course of history   &mdash;   it is POWER that determines the course of history. Prior to the Renaissance, the Church was often very successful in protecting the integrity of their &#8220;geocentric&#8221; universe theory   &mdash;   this wasn&rsquo;t because they were objectively correct, it was simply because they possessed the POWER to influence the intellectual direction of society.</p>
<p>Here Mr. Taylor has pointed out the obviously silly and puerile basis that underpins the psychotic leftist movement in America   &mdash;   so what? It&rsquo;s already been shown that the prevailing psychology of the United States is self-contradictory and doomed to failure. Nothing will change until someone else has the POWER to change it   &mdash;   And, at least as far as our race is concerned, the balance has been locked in the enemies favor for quite a long time, at least several decades. If there is one area in which we can do nothing but ADMIRE our enemies, it is how they didn&rsquo;t let logic and reason stand in the way of putting their agenda into reality. Occasionally, when it suited their needs, they might appeal to reason just in order to strengthen the assault that they had already started, but this wasn&rsquo;t the fundamental part of their success. </p>
<p>Trust me, America will go under, just the way that all nations in human history have gone when they foolishly try to ignore the laws of human nature. Human beings MUST have a sense of immediate connection to their nation that can only be achieved when they identify with it on a fundamental racial level. You can&rsquo;t just slap disparate peoples together and expect harmony to ensue. This is exactly why the most recent wave of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; to the United States only regard America as though it were a shopping mall, not a legitimate community with real needs for its survival and advancement.</p>

I am still willing to die for this country, right now we are losing the battle, but friends the war is far from over.<br>
our real enemies are not Iraqi, or Iranian, but liberal white americans.  those people who are willing to live in shame and fear, humiliation.  <br>
I will die proud and on my feet with my boots laced up tight.<br>
and I will not give up until i fail to draw breath</p>

&#8220;If so, you should come here to California. That&rsquo;s about the phenotype of lots of these light-skinned Mexicans running around here. &#8220;<br>
&#8220;Are they better behaved and more civilized in Argentina for some reason? &#8220;</p>
<p>Robert, how do you define &#8220;hispanic&#8221;?  This is the term used by the establishment of the USA to describe the dark-skinned mixed Amerinds.  Argentineans do not fit this mold.  I was born there and I&rsquo;m of European descent. We are mostly of Italian and Spanish descent.  The rest are of German, Russian, Ukranian, English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, Polish, Slovenian, etc., and also Jews, Gypsies, Syrians, Lebanese, and others.  Go to some parts of southern Argentina and see some of the towns founded by the Welsh who still speak their language in public.  There are a small minority of pure indigenous peoples (mostly up north) and some mixed (the ones we call &#8220;hispanic&#8221; in the USA).  Even the mixed ones are more intelligent than the odd mixture of mestizos you get in the USA.  If you don&rsquo;t believe Argentina is not white, I suggest to go to the Oktoberfest in Villa General Belgrano in the province of Cordoba, which is a beautiful province.   You will find the towns to be very quaint and European looking. The Oktberfest, or Festival de la Cerveza (Beer Festival), will knock your socks off.  It included a parade with representatives from various European peoples of Argentina, which included Russia, Greece, Italy, Germany, Austria, Ukraine, Switzerland, Spain, Romania, and many others. It was nice to see the various ethnic groups from Europe all togther in a parade with some European tunes to accompany it.  Patagonia is even more European.  Try San Martin de los Andes and you&rsquo;ll see the Swiss, German, and Austrian influence in the architecture.  In short, the country was a country of European immigrants, very similar to North America and Australia.  The main difference is the language.  Of course, it is a Latin (meaning of Latin Europe) country in culture and habit so there are some cultural norms which might no be agreeable by Anglo or Germanic standards, however, racially you won&rsquo;t complain.  It&rsquo;s not an economic paradise, but you should really consider visiting there.  A lot of Europeans are buying up properties in Argentina like there was no tomorrow.  </p>
<p>Ghw wrote: &#8220;I&rsquo;m sure they are. Salty is right. An Argentine is not a light-skinned Mexican. Argentina considers itself a &ldquo;European&rdquo; country (whatever population statistics you may quote), and Argentinians will explicitly TELL you they are Europeans, if you make the mistake of calling them &ldquo;Latin Americans&rdquo;. I speak from experience. In this, Argentina is more like the USA was prior to 1965 when we were not groveling and kowtowing and ashamed to be who we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is exactly right.  I&rsquo;m tired of being lumped in with uneducated, illiterate dark-skinned people from Mexico and Central America who find their way over to the USA.  The difference between us and them is quite literally night and day.  Ask any Mexican what they think of an Argentinean.  It&rsquo;s nothing pleasant because they feel intimidated because we&rsquo;re white and more sophisticated.  They will kiss the behind of a white American because they know that they are getting a good deal, but if you only knew what they thought of you as the naive white &#8220;Anglo&#8221; American that you are considered to be.</p>

<p>Yes, but unfortunately the government is letting in black Africans in hoards now from at least six African nations and it&rsquo;s starting to look bad.  The Chinese are going there in swarms to get that tax-free ride for the first five years to open businesses.  There are many Koreans who&rsquo;ve been immigrating for years and some Japanese who&rsquo;ve been there even longer for several generations now.  The cities are being flooded with dark-skinned Bolivians, Colombians, Peruvians, Chileans, and others who will make a tourist believe that they are Argentineans, but they are not.  On the good side, there are many Russian immigrants there and they are still migrating by the numbers and they feel welcome and at home there.  The majority of the population is of European descent from the flood of European immigrants back at the beginning of last century but like most of the West it will succumb to international pressures to accept nonwhites along with the new hate crimes laws that I think will be formed soon.  However, I do encourage white people to visit Patagonia and the province of Cordoba and see for yourself what it&rsquo;s like and consider buying land to someday settle. It would be better to settle there eventually without the influence of political correctness that is unbearable in North America and in Europe.  I think that may be the future for whites if North America and parts of Europe are going to the dogs.  At least enjoy it before the Chinese take over.</p>

<p>Exactly.  Argentina and Australia (I&rsquo;ve visited both) are the way to go.  But I would say more Argentina. Some try to pose as Latin Americans, but they¡re not. In fact, the rest of Latin American doesnt much like the Argentians.  So, they must be doing something right.</p>
<p>They are a little goofy, what with five Presidents in two weeks back in 2001/2002.  But they are no threat, the girls are knockouts and the guys are lovable pushovers.  And lots of them loved to practice their english when I was there.  They are a sweet people.  Though a little kooky to be sure.  But then, who are we to judge.  Oh, and if you make an appointment with them to meet tomorrow at 4pm, bring a book. They have almost no sense of punctuality.</p>

			<p>Washington believes that if they drown us in alien Hispanics and Spanish we will eventually passively accept their presence here.  They are wrong!  They are fools who know nothing about human nature or patriotism.  Whenever I see a Hispanic these days I am grossly offended by his presence in my country and want him gone from the American landscape.  Whenever I hear Spanish being spoken I want to silence it and whenever I see Spanish language advertising or merchandise I want to vandalize it.  Somehow I don&rsquo;t believe I am alone in this feeling&hellip;</p>

<p>Oh believe me, many mexicans here in the US don&rsquo;t like the &#8220;gringo&#8221;(white man). Their numbers are getting so large, they now make no pretense of kissing whitey&rsquo;s backside but are now marching in the streets waving their mexicans flags.</p>

This is without any doubt orchestrated by the same people who invented and brought you marxism, communism feminism, anti-racism, post-colonial studies, critical whiteness studies, multicuturalism, and most other bad, destructive, anti-white and plain evil things. How much evidence does it take for most people to wake up from the death grip these people have on our white nations?</p>

			<p>There are other concerns besides cultural including economic.  Why is it that in South America, Argentina has the highest standard of living?  Why is most economic activity concentrated in the southern flank of Brazil where the majority of Whites are concentrated?  Why does South Africa account for 60% of GNP for Africa with almost all the rest in Arab North Africa?  </p>

<p>That is precisely what I&rsquo;ve been trying to say.  I know better than many people that they don&rsquo;t like whites.  They say this in Spanish too.  <br>
But to many whites this doesn&rsquo;t matter since they always believe the myth that &#8220;this belongs to Mexico&#8221; spiel and we&rsquo;re supposed to pay for our past sins and accept the idea that this was stolen from the.  I get this from WHITE people.  They&rsquo;ve seen the marches, yet they still defend the people who tell them that they should go back to Europe.  </p>

			<p>Ben D., I don&rsquo;t beleive white guilt is a factor when it comes to many whites attitude towards Mexican people. In fact, what I have noticed over the years is that many whites feel a sense of natural superiority over Mexican folks, and that is why they underestimate them them. I have never subscribed to the view that Mexicans are naturally dumb. No way. Many of these people may not be educated in the bookish sense, but I can tell you that very many I&rsquo;ve met have more common sense than a lot of white people. You tend to have your common sense or street smarts, more developed when you come from countries where you have been deprived. Mexico qualifies for that description. But back to my point, which is basically this, WE HATE THOSE WHO WE FEEL OUR SUPERIOR TO US AND TEND TO TAKE LIGHTLY THOSE WHOM WE THINK ARE NOT. Just human nature.</p>
