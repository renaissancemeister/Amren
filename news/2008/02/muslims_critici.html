						<p>Furious Muslims have heavily criticised Walkers crisps after it emerged that certain varieties of the manufacturer&rsquo;s products contain trace elements of alcohol.</p>
<p>Some crisp types use minute amounts of alcohol as a chemical agent to extract certain flavours.</p>
<p>The report in Asian newspaper Eastern Eye, highlights concerns raised by shopkeeper Besharat Rehman, who owns a halal supermarket in Bradford, West Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Mr Rehman told the paper: &#8220;A customer informed us that Sensations Thai Sweet Chilli and Doritos Chilli Heat Wave are not on Walkers&rsquo; alcohol-free list. Our suppliers were unaware of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if it is a trace amount of alcohol, Walkers should make it clear on the packaging so that the customer can make an informed choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel frustrated and angry. I have let my customers down simply because such a big company like Walkers is not sensitive to Muslim needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of them were my daughter&rsquo;s favourite crisps. As soon as I found out about the alcohol in them, I called home to ask my wife to throw out all the packets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shuja Shafi, who chairs the food standards committee of the Muslim Council of Britain, said that he intended to investigate. &#8220;Certainly we would find it very offensive to have eaten food with alcohol.&#8221;</p>
<p>Masood Khawaja, of the Halal Food Authority, said that this was not the first time the issue had been raised with Walkers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should have looked into the matter and solved it instead of hiding behind labelling regulations. It does not matter what percentage of alcohol is involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides Muslims, there are a lot of teetotal people who would not like to consume alcohol in any form. As far as possible we try and lobby for halal symbols on popular products like Kellogg&rsquo;s cereals.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we have always told Muslims to check the contents list even if a product is marked suitable for vegetarians. But to not mention it on the packaging is unfair.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, a spokesperson for Walkers said that trace amounts of alcohol in crisps or bread are believed to be permissible for Muslims.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not add alcohol to our products. However, ethyl alcohol may be present in trace amounts in a very small number of our flavours.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is used as a carrying agent for flavourings, and is found in many common food and drink products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Foods like bread can also contain the same or higher trace amounts due to fermentation.  &#8220;We are aware of the concerns from some Muslim consumers about the appropriateness of specific ingredients. We take the concerns of our consumers extremely seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;In previous assessments by Muslim scholars, foods and drinks that contain trace amounts of ethyl alcohol have been confirmed as permissible for Muslim consumption because of both the fact that the ingredient does not bear its original qualities and does not change the taste, colour or smell of the product, and its very low level.&#8221;<br>

			<p>This is just a smokescreen. What they want is for you to kowtow to them and their religion one little piece at a time. Before you know it, their rules will prevail and you&rsquo;ll be following them. Tell them of that famous Latin quotation, &#8221; In holus jammit.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t yeast bread contain a tiny amount of alchohol?</p>
<p>WIKIPEDIA:  Yeast, most commonly Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is used in baking as a leavening agent, where it converts the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide. This causes the dough to expand or rise as the carbon dioxide forms pockets or bubbles. When the dough is baked it &#8220;sets&#8221; and the pockets remain, giving the baked product a soft and spongy texture. The use of potatoes, water from potato boiling, eggs, or sugar in a bread dough accelerates the growth of yeasts. Salt and fats such as butter slow down yeast growth. The majority of the yeast used in baking is of the same species common in alcoholic fermentation</p>
<p>What other common foods have traces of alchohol?</p>

			<p>English culture revolves around alcohol, and I&rsquo;ve met quite a few muslims who could drink an Englishman under the table.  They&rsquo;d still have trouble with the Aussies, though.</p>

			<p>Bread doesn&rsquo;t list alcohol content either, but if it is leavened it will contain alcohol. In fact as far as trace amounts of alcohol go I believe most food products contain some.</p>

			<p>Odd that they would make such a fuss because a trace amount of alcohol offends their religion. When I was in the military, we trained with Saudis and Iranians (this was 30 years ago)and they LOVED getting away from their restrictive Muslim countries and swoggling down all the alcohol they could get their hands on.</p>

			<p>Humans also make small amounts of ethanol so they are all apostates and heratics and need to be executed by beheading immediately.</p>

			<p>Muslims invading Christian countries since their &#8221; generation &#8221; into being is nothing new, unfortunately. Old habits are hard to &#8221; die &#8221; ; they have being doing since the 7 th century. Where are : King Sobelski, Charles Martel and El Cid when we need them ?</p>

			<p>What did the 9/11 hijackers do the night before they died?</p>
<p>They drank at a strip bar and from what I heard they complained about the prices.</p>
<p>Think about that. They were going to die the next day but they were still concerned about how much they were going to spend.</p>

			<p>This legalism in their &#8216;religion&rsquo;, which is their life-their identity, is just another example of the lie that they live. </p>

<p>Countless foods have trace elements of alcohol.</p>
<p>Ordinary fruit juice has a significant of alcohol. Chemicals are normally put in grape juice to prevent alcohol formation. Still your ordinary glass of grape juice from the store is 0.5% proof alcohol.</p>
<p>Note that grape juice is allowed by Islam, so long as they don&rsquo;t get drunk off it.<br>

<p>It is kind of sad that low IQ muslims in Britain can&rsquo;t even follow their own religion properly.</p>
<p>It is even sadder that the natives continue to tolerate this sort of blatant bullying. I guess the British bulldog spirit has long since been extinguished.</p>
