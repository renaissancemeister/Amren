						<p>Officials at local organizations that aid immigrants and refugees say they have experienced an increase in hate mail and threatening phone calls.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Curtis said they started to receive phone calls, letters and e-mails last year from an individual who disagreed with their work on behalf of refugees. She said they had to call the police twice because they felt threatened by him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chattanooga resident Rick Pinson, who said he doesn&rsquo;t support bringing refugees to the United States, said he doesn&rsquo;t believe &#8220;American soldiers who fought and died for this country did so it could be given away to people from other countries, and that taxpayers be required to pay for their welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>America Gruner, president of the Coalition of Latino Leaders in Dalton, Ga., and Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, said they also have seen a spike in the number of hate e-mails and phone calls they receive.</p>
<p>Ms. Gruner said they have gotten several threatening phone calls since they started the organization in 2006, mostly from people telling them to go back to their country and accusing them of registering undocumented immigrants to vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mike Feely, a City Council member and director of the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Center, a community outreach group, said better communication is needed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A poisonous atmosphere has been developed and that&rsquo;s why I think we would benefit from discussions in a place where people can come and talk about this (immigration) without being labeled,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>Rather than engage in asinine behaviors - e.g., threats - tis far better to shun/make social pariahs of the individuals and their families who engage in the organized aiding and abetting of &#8220;immigrants&rsquo; and &#8220;refugees&#8221;.  Especially members of the legal professions and press.</p>
<p>An alternative, more impactful tactic is to volunteer one&rsquo;s time &amp; effort to such an organization in order to discover, document, and disseminate what really takes place inside said organization - the actions, behaviors, attitudes, and affiliations of those who direct it.  While there, discover, document, and disseminate its sources of funding, in-kind donations, and alliances.  Become an investigative/intelligence agency of one for crying out loud rather than waiting for some news agency or legislative body to investigate.</p>

			<p>the article doesn&rsquo;t mention the orgs. responsible for immigration rallies around the country; these orgs. being: the hebrew immigration aid society and the american jewish committee. I&rsquo;m sure there are others&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>Americans are sick of having their country overrun with the help of course of the US government and they&rsquo;re sick of having their tax dollars go to pay for these people while they themselves get no help from the government. I live in Texas. We spend 5 BILLION a year on medical care for illegals all the while where I live, services for the mentally ill americans have been cut so deeply that it is very difficult for helpless mentally ill americans to get the help they need. This is what we are sick of.<br>

			<p>Well, if the &#8220;immigrant Agencies&#8221; would kindly plop their Third-world importees into the gated communities which give them their support, their wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. Keep the gates closed and keep them the heck inside.</p>

<p>100% correct.  Men sacrifice themselves in war as a form of adaptation, to protect their homeland and genetic destiny.  To give away their homeland and encourage genetic displacement is to reject the laws of nature. </p>

			<p>      Good work, fellow Americans. Now let&rsquo;s turn up the heat<br>
even more. One of the core principles of Marxism is to deny any<br>
good whatsoever in your opponents. This is what out enemies have<br>
done to us. Now let none accuse us as we serve them likewise.<br>
Didn&rsquo;t someone once say &#8220;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&#8221;?<br>

<p>Because of the selling out of this country to il-legal immigration interests, I nor my children would never risk there lives again for this country.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable that the wannabe presidential runners are not addressing this problem.  We are no longer a nation to be proud of.</p>

			<p>Most &#8220;local&#8221; community agencies survive on government money; there&rsquo;s no financial support from the real community. So let your mayor and town council and governor know they will lose your vote if they fund pro-immigrant groups. And let any Christian or Jewish charities you contribute to that they will not get a penny if they promote sanctuary status for illegals.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t vent with hate-mail; hit &#8216;em where it hurts.</p>

			<p>wondeful news, we need more pressure on these agencies. They claim to be charities but are in this business for profit only. Their hypocrisy is tranparent and their real motives apparent to everyone. It&rsquo;s all about the money and to h*** with the country and it&rsquo;s citizens as long as their coffers are being filled.</p>

<p><br>
Oh my! Over a period of TWO YEARS, they have had to put up with SEVERAL unhappy callers! How did the poor dears ever survive such intermittent episodes of not-niceness? Truly, these are American heroes on a par with the Founding Fathers! </p>
<p>And thank you, Perla Trevizo, for bringing these monumental human-rights outrages to our attention! You are a credit to your Raza! Without token minorities like you on the staff, the people of Chattanooga might be forced to read about things that are ACTUALLY NEWSWORTHY! <br>

<p>I know how you feel, Fedup.  We&rsquo;re getting to a dangerous point where many Whites are beginning to understand that this country doesn&rsquo;t represent them anymore and they turn their backs on it.  I suppose the people in charge think they can replace them with nonwhite foreigners.  Look at military recruitment.  Look at the aliens who have been caught selling secrets to the enemy, notably the Chinese guy a few years back.  It&rsquo;s a threat to National Security and it&rsquo;ll get worse if and when Whites decide to start playing the same game.</p>
