						<p>THE Polish government wants Britain to make Polish a standard choice for British children studying a foreign language because so many are now living in the UK.</p>
<p>Krzysztof Stanowski, Poland&rsquo;s deputy minister of education, said that Polish language teaching had &#8220;about the same status as Swahili&#8221; even though there were now some 100,000 Polish pupils in British schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;It should have a higher status,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would be unrealistic to say we could set up Polish as a second or third language in British schools in time for the next school year. But the year after, why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month Stanowski met Ed Balls, the children, schools and families secretary, on a visit to London to discuss raising the profile of his country&rsquo;s language, both to improve provision for Polish pupils in British schools and to increase British pupils&rsquo; awareness of Poland.</p>
<p>This weekend Balls&rsquo; department declined to comment, but Stanowski said: &#8220;The British side has been very enthusiastic.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No specifics have yet been settled. We need a few months of talks. We&rsquo;re planning to set up regular meetings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Poland joined the European Union in 2004 more than 600,000 Poles have arrived in Britain. In a report the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust has recommended the appointment of Polish-speaking staff members in schools with a high immigrant population. It also warned that attendance by Polish children is poor, with many parents choosing to take them home to Poland during term-time to avoid high air fares during the holidays.</p>
<p>Polish still has some way to go if it is to become the second language in British schools. Last year about 2,000 pupils took Polish GCSE compared with 81,000 taking German and 217,000 taking French.</p>
<p>Here are some Polish words that could feature in school textbooks in Britain</p>
<p>pszczolka (pronounced pshchoowkah) &mdash; bee</p>
<p>przedzierzgnac (pron pshedsherszgnonch) &mdash; change</p>
<p>szczescie (pron shchenshcheh) &mdash; luck</p>
<p>trzeszczec (pron trsheshchech) &mdash; creak</p>
<p>przepchnac (pron prszephnonch) &mdash; push</p>
<p>przedrzezniacz (pron prshedrsheshniach) &mdash; mocking bird</p>
<p>wstrzasnac (pron vstrshasnonch) &mdash; shake</p>
<p>przedyskutowywac (pron prshediscootovivach) &mdash; discuss</p>
<p>- Now try to pronounce this well-known Polish tongue-twister</p>
<p>W Szczebrzeszynie chrzaszca brzmi w trzcinie i Szczebrzeszyn z tego slynie.</p>
<p>In Szczebrzeszyn a beetle buzzes in the reed, for which Szczebrzeszyn is famous.</p>

			<p>I support multiculturalism among Europeans.  What the Polish education deputy minister is saying is not all that unusual - Polish is certainly more important than Swahili.  The Polish people go to Anglo nations and learn English because they are very intelligent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to know other languages.  I believe Mr. Taylor knows Japanese and French.  C&rsquo;est bien!  J&rsquo;ai etudie le francais, un peu.</p>

			<p>Perhaps.  But a strong case could be made that, unlike with immigrants of color, polish values add to and augment british culture.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism and diversity is a lie.  But at the root of the lie is the complete inferiority and moral depravity of people of color.  Or put another way, choose white immigrants above colored ones and the country will be FAR better off.  The best choice is ethnic homogeneity.  But there definitely is a tier system when it comes to immigration desirability.  Hot, young, marriage/family oriented polish babes are a FAR better choice than violent, disgusting welfare leeches from africa.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way it is.  It&rsquo;s time we were honest about it.</p>

			<p>My parents are from poland and i must admit that I&rsquo;m shocked by this news.  Naturally, I believe that Polish children in England should be made to learn English.  Poland is really pushing its luck with this.  At best, the EU may fund polish as a second language for these kids, but really if its important for Polish parents, they should pay.  Poland probably figures that if 3rd worlders are getting special treatment, then why shouldn&rsquo;t the Poles as true Europeans also.  Nevertheless I Poland is wrong here.  On the bright side, Poles certainly integrate faster in British society than 3rd worlders, Joseph Conrad being one example.  On a side note, as a Polish speaker, the words they give as examples are exceptionally difficult words, the language isn&rsquo;t that brutal to learn.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m all for European states eliminating tariff barriers, harmonizing regulations, and even merging their currencies.  Cooperating to achieve economic growth, encourage peace, and all that is fine.</p>
<p>But they should remain nation-states.  Portugal a nation of ethnic Portuguese.  Denmark of ethnic Danes, and the UK a nation solely of ethnic natives of Great Britain and (Northern) Ireland. </p>
<p>The USA is an example of successfully merging white ethnic groups, but Europe should not be.</p>
<p>Of course, importing demographically or culturally significant numbers of nonwhites of any kind into any white country is anathema.</p>

			<p>The English are bending over backwards to have their schools promote Arabic and various other Third World languages. Perhaps the mattter is one of the English being bleeding heart liberals regarding non-whites who also tend to have great contempt for almost all other European peoples and cultures.</p>
<p>In morals, religion, and traditional European folk cultural ways, Poles today are far more conservative than the English - it is like comparing Jesse Helms to Hillary Clinton. That being the case, Britian desperatley needs Poles to help them redisciver European cultural conservatism.</p>

<p>Might very well be the case. The East European immigration is a true litmus test of multiculti immigration myth which already reveals the hypocrisy. </p>
<p>When Easterners come, out of sudden everybody is complaining on too many people coming, overwhelmed services and (gasp) cultural menace of all them li&rsquo;l Catholics flooding the British schools. I bet that not a single of these complainers would dare to say a word about non-white immigrants.</p>

			<p>Hey, at least they are Europeans. The Polish language may be short on vowels but I am more concerned with Pashtu, Irdu, Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, Patois etc. etc. The Poles are a hard working people who appreciate the freedom and prosperity of Western Europe, unlike the    3rd world parasites who have nothing but hatred and disdain for Western culture, Western ideals, Western social mores and especially the Christian religion. I would rather have a Polish neighbor than any speaker of the other above listed languages. </p>

			<p>If the Polish have a burning desire to speak Polish, why don&rsquo;t they stay in Poland? If they move to England then learn &amp; use English. Doesn&rsquo;t matter to me if they are white. Their language is &#8220;alien&#8221; to Britain. If the British wanted to speak Polish, wouldn&rsquo;t they move to Poland?</p>

			<p>&#8220;THE Polish government wants Britain to make Polish a standard choice for British children studying a foreign language because so many are now living in the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p>As long as it is a choice. I&rsquo;m all for learning another language if it is done for personal or educational reasons. I think it is good to know 2 languages, however learning a second language should be a choice and never be forced because of immigration or one country invading another. Poles are definitely better than arabs,africans and such but the UK is a seperate country and no country should allow mass immigration at once, even of the same race, to the point that is challenges or replaces the dominant culture. That is what some people miss.</p>

<p>Exactly, and if I were a young single Englishman, I think I&rsquo;d be looking for one of them instead of a typically Marxified/sluttified English girl. (Not that they&rsquo;re all in that category, obviously, but I understand that far too many are).</p>

			<p>Words every Pole should know before coming to my country. Scrounge, benefits and human rights. As for the Polish Memorial, they were the country responsible for getting us into WWII in the first place. It was France that had the treaty with Poland, but then France did what it did in WWI and caved in.</p>

			<p>The British need to give a hard time for Poles, and all immigrants for that matter if they want to preserve their nation. The Polish government should be seeking to bring back the hundreds of thousands of people they lost and not allow them to have a comfortable living experience out of their native country. This isn&rsquo;t positive for any nation.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s right Anglicus, Poland should never have invaded Germany on Sept. 1, 1939. If Chamberlain hadn&rsquo;t appeased Hitler, the &#8220;nation of shopkeepers&#8221;, would never have found itself at war. Blaming Poland is hilarious! Haven&rsquo;t heard that one-ever! </p>

			<p>The Poles can be assimilated, both genetically and culturally. The various black and brown people can&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s assume not one more person ever entered Britain. In 100 years there would be no Polish problem, but there would be a black and brown problem.</p>

			<p>The Polish government, as well as most governments in the world fear the English Language. The Polish language much like the French Language is probably limited to 100,000 words or less. (look it up) </p>
<p>The hegemonic influence of the English Language is so strong, that even native languages use the English language to describe something because there is no words in that native language that can aptly be used to describe much new phenomena especially technical and medical, The English language is a sponge. It readily adopts new words from any native language and uses it as easily as the native language does. Some examples are Tsunami, jihad, Sputnik, fatwa, yogi. Words that end up in everyday English language with no doubt of their meanings.</p>
<p>The dominance of the English language is because of the American influence, mostly through entertainment and technology.</p>
<p>Two hundred years from now, the dominate world language will probably be a dialect of Chinese.</p>
<p>However in England some bleeding heart do gooder will jump on the Polish government bandwagon and advocate for the rights of Polish Education in A Dominate English society. Doesn&rsquo;t this right belong to the parents of Polish children who left Poland for economic reasons, a better life for their families, to, if they so desire,  give their children a mother language without using tax payer dollars to so so. (Saturday morning Polish education classes should be ok.)</p>

         Poles emigrating to England are, in fact, NOT entitled to any Brtish unemployment benefits.Virtually every single one of them works - which is more tha can be said for the natives.</p>

			<p>Chuck Woolery. I didn&rsquo;t say that Poland invaded or declared war on Germany did I? I just said that it was France that had the treaty with Poland and they reneged on it. I don&rsquo;t know if you are American or not, but let me ask why the USA turned away Jewish refugees from Germany at the beginning of the war and why did it take two years for you to get involved if your government thought the Nazis were an evil regime.</p>

			<p>My parents are Polish and have lived in England for over 40 years now and I was born here. They made an effort to integrate, make friends and discover the history and culture of Britain.</p>
<p>Previously it was the more educated parts of Polish society that came here, now a large part of them are complete primitives, ignorant, unable to speak the language, and hostile to everything British (which British people don&rsquo;t realise, being unable to understand them). Also, the fact that they are coming over in such large numbers means that even very small towns have their own Polish ghettos, with Poles looking more and more like Britain&rsquo;s Mexicans.</p>

			<p>I have nothing against foreign languages other than the usual ones - such as French,German,etc - being taught in schools,but this seems to be less about this,than about us being lectured to and almost having to surrender our own language.</p>
<p>Would the Polish Government be so interested in us learning Polish if there weren&rsquo;t so many Poles in the UK? They should be learning English.</p>
