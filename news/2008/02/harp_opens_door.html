						<p>Some musicians credit their golden voices with career success. Others, their blistering guitar riffs.</p>
<p>Orla Fallon, a member of the platinum-selling Irish group Celtic Woman, thanks her lucky harp.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just opened so many doors for me. Doors that I would never have been let in otherwise,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been to so many places and met some lovely people because of my harp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fallon and the other four members of Celtic Woman (Chloë, Máiréad, Lynn Hilary and Alex Sharpe), will perform a mix of traditional Irish songs and contemporary works during their stop at the Pensacola Civic Center on Saturday.</p>
<p>Fallon, who is also known for her ethereal singing voice, said she fell in love with the harp while attending boarding school in Dublin.</p>
<p>&#8220;The school had a fabulous harping tradition, and I got really passionate about it there,&#8221; said the performer, who hails from the tiny village of Knockananna in Southeast Ireland.</p>
<p>So passionate, in fact, that when a music teacher suggested Fallon buy her own harp, the budding musician was willing to sell her beloved pony in order to order to purchase the instrument.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a very soothing thing. Even when I was a student, I would go up and practice, and no matter how stressed I was, playing the harp would lift my spirits,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her accomplishments include winning the International Feis Ceoil and International Pan Celtic competitions twice, touring extensively in Europe and the United States, both as a soloist and with groups such as Clannad, Anuna and oboist David Agnew. Her debut album, &#8220;The Water is Wide,&#8221; won critical acclaim.</p>
<p>Fallon signed on with Celtic Woman for a PBS special, little knowing that it would become a worldwide tour still going strong four years later.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She is delighted that international audiences have found their own strong connections with the music of Ireland.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people say that this music has touched their heart in some way, reached down in their souls,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Life is so busy and pressurized, running from one thing to the next, that these songs provide a head space for audiences. It&rsquo;s easy, gentle music to listen to.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Here is a group of relatively unknown talented and beautiful White women, and yet the media pushes walking compost heaps like Britney Spears, Lindsey Lohan, and Paris Hilton down our throats 24/7.</p>
<p>I guess grace and class don&rsquo;t sell as many papers as puking and night-vision amateur porn scandals.</p>

			<p>The ever watchful Stalinists the Southern Poverty Law Center will use this article link by Amren to prove to donators, primarily Jewish, that Amren is the most hateful of hate groups. The self-righteously vicious and endlessly hypocrtical SPLC hates Highland Games, Burns Night suppers, Irish music and dance events, and, especially, any talk of how important Irish and Scotish cultures are to southern culture. All Irish cultural expression to them is some combination of all the falsehood they believe about the antebellum south as a den of one undending rape of black women and murder of black men combined with the falsehood they believe about immigrant Irish neighborhoods in cities in the north: corupt cops stealing from honest Jews and beating helpless and angelic blacks.</p>

			<p>  I have seen these wonderful ladies on a T.V. special about Celtic music. They are fantastic. I get misty-eyed and long for my old ancestral homeland when I hear their music. They are truly an inspiration for all white people. You need a reason to be proud of your heritage, Celtic Woman is that reason. We have the most beautiful women on the planet. Plus, they are extremely talented. If you get a chance to see them on television or in person, you must go.</p>

			<p>The violinist on the left above played a couple of sensational numbers in Michael Flatley&rsquo;s Feet of Flames video.  She&rsquo;s not only a knockout, she&rsquo;s one of the most talented violinists I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>

			<p>I went on youtube and watched a few of their videos - they are the very flower of womanhood.  </p>
<p>On a side note, if you want to be around white people, and there isn&rsquo;t a library around, head to one of these concerts; it was beautiful.</p>

			<p>Definately recommend seeing them. Concert at Slane Castle with Chloe, Orla, Lisa, Maeve and Hayley is outstanding!!<br>

			<p>I just clicked on to the web site, plus popped up You Tube as well.  These women are absolutely far and away first class singers, and their songs are quite beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really refreshing to hear their music, especially compared to some of the animalistic junk that&rsquo;s on the air waves any more.<br>

			<p>To fill in the cultural vacuum a little more, I want to recommend Susan Cooper&rsquo;s &#8220;The Dark is Rising&#8221; sequence.  In it she introduces young readers to their native myths in order to teach them bravery in times of increasing chaos.  The protagonists are, truly, &#8220;children of light&#8221; and they don&rsquo;t truck with evil.  And this fantasy set is better written than the Potter books.  Trust me, you&rsquo;ll like these.</p>

			<p>Ranger, a thousand thanks for posting those links.  I&rsquo;d never heard of either group before, and I am even now amazed at the beauty and purity of Celtic Woman.  I&rsquo;ll try the High Kings once I&rsquo;ve sampled all of Celtic Woman&rsquo;s artistry.</p>

<p>My thoughts exactly.  Fans of  Asian/white race-mixing need to take heed of this example here.  You can only create this crème de la crème of European womanhood with 2 WHITE parents.  Any kind of racial outcrossing can only ruin this kind of perfection.  White people wake up, and preserve the beauty, grace and talent that are inherent in our genes.  Eschew all miscegenation.</p>

			<p>Just be happy these ladies are *not* famous.  The entertainment industry is notorious for destroying everything it touches.</p>
<p>For a male rock band with bagpipes, try &#8220;Seven Nations.&#8221;</p>

Thanks for the you tube links. I was aware of these two groups but I never listened to their music until I watched the videos. I&rsquo;m not much of a dance fan, but I watched the dance video with the High Kings and it was entertaining and fascinating. <br>
It breaks my heart to know that our youth are being dragged into the vulgar and no talented world of &#8220;urban&#8221; music. Only a serious fool would believe that there is any true value or worth in the repulsive garbage that passes for music today. <br>
Taking such a beautiful thing and positioning it as a point of pride for our race may be &#8220;combative&#8221; and &#8220;divisive&#8221; to some, but I feel that we are left with no choice; the inversion of our world being hoisted on us must be challenged at every turn. If we don&rsquo;t point out these stark contrasts and encourage our young people to embrace those things that our race has created to make the world a better place we will surely be lost forever. Take the high road - applaud the positive and eschew the negative; always strive to teach our children the difference between the two!<br>
The day may be coming when the sword will be the final purveyor of sense and logic; are you ready? <br>

			<p>Why would the media rather focus on the &#8220;walking compost heaps&#8221; than on decent entertainment?</p>
<p>Well, the Powers That Be are simply copying the tried and true techniques practiced by the Roman emperors. &#8220;Keep the masses entertained   &mdash;   and they won&rsquo;t have to think&#8221;</p>
<p>Now WHY on earth would our controlled media and our government prefer us peasants NOT to think? Well, put it this way&hellip; If too many people started to do some real thinking&hellip; it would lead to too much questions being raised. About obscene profits in the aftermath of certain events. About far too many government shennanigans, for just another example. Why it might even lead to people coming to realize that certain well-established &#8220;truths&#8221; just might not be as true as we&rsquo;ve been told by our leaders.</p>

Ease up, Lohan is a nice Celtic name.  And judging by the looks of these rather fetching young harpists, I may have to get into Celtic harping myself.  For the music and cultural aspects of course.     </p>

			<p>Why would the media rather focus on the &#8220;walking compost heaps&#8221; than on decent entertainment (much less some really newsworthy issues)?</p>
<p>Well, the Powers That Be are simply copying the tried and true techniques developed by the Roman emperors. &#8220;Keep the masses entertained   &mdash;   and they won&rsquo;t have time to think&#8221;</p>

Well, put it this way&hellip; If too many people started to do some real thinking&hellip; it would lead to far too many questions being raised. About obscene profits in the aftermath of a number of earth-shaking WORLD events. Also about far too many government shennanigans, for just another example. Why it might even lead to people coming face to face with the reality that certain well-established &#8220;truths&#8221; just might turn out to be not be as true as we&rsquo;ve been told to believe, by our leaders over the last century or two!</p>
<p>Remember: You can&rsquo;t stop people from thinking by a legislative trick or two. But you sure CAN STOP THEM from thinking by filling their heads with more vital stuff   &mdash;   football and other sports scores (vastly more important). Or with the endless nonsense about those empty-headed Hollywood stars and starlets. Even hyping them up with that Afro-American genius, Oprah Winfrey&rsquo;s pronouncements from her throne! The law-breaking shenannigans of sports and entertainment figures. That way the real truths will remain safely hidden from public scrutiny.</p>

			<p>Its great to see Irish traditional music has an audience in America. But don&rsquo;t forget that you have wonderful traditional music yourself, in country and bluegrass that has resisted the degradation of other music forms. Alison Kraus is particularly good.</p>

			<p>Since &#8220;Just Say No To Mixing&#8221; has brought up the subject of white-Asian mixing, I would like to ask the following question:</p>
<p>Since I am 3/16 American Indian (Cherokee and Tuskarora), does my being married to a Japanese gal represent a tragedy for the white race?</p>
