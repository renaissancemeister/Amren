						<p>Some progress has been made for African-Americans, but 40 years after riots filled urban cities across the country there is still a gap between blacks and whites in areas such as poverty, education, crime and unemployment, according to new findings from the Kerner Commission.</p>
<p>Despite an emerging black middle class and increases in black entrepreneurs and public officials at all levels, the commission that famously warned the United States is moving toward &#8220;two societies, one black, one white &mdash; separate and unequal&#8221; found that few goals have been met since its bombshell 1968 findings.</p>
<p>President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed the original commission during Detroit&rsquo;s 1967 riots. The panel investigated what led to the city&rsquo;s six days of civil unrest and 43 deaths. When the commission reconvened last year, it made Detroit its first stop.</p>
<p>The commission&rsquo;s grade on progress across the country for African-Americans: D+. It&rsquo;s a mark that resonates in metropolitan Detroit, the nation&rsquo;s most segregated region.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing I can point to in our present-day experience that tell us that we are significantly better off today than we were (then),&#8221; said Arthur Johnson, a former president of the NAACP Detroit branch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The income gap is real and something we have the right to argue about. It has come to a point where we must tell this nation that we are not going to accept the miseducation and the misdirection of education resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, the Washington, D.C.-based Eisenhower Foundation reconvened the commission during the 40th anniversary of the 1967 riots. The initial 11-member panel warned the nation faced a &#8220;system of apartheid&#8221; in major cities and urged legislation to create jobs and improve housing. {snip}</p>
<p>The updated findings were compiled through hearings in Detroit, Newark and Washington, D.C., which had riots in the 1960s. Some have suggested the incidents were a rebellion against a lack of jobs and education in Detroit.</p>
<p>The commission&rsquo;s report, which will be released in full this year, found:</p>
<p>o Some employers still &#8220;steer&#8221; minority applicants into the worst jobs; real estate agents send them to less desirable neighborhoods and mortgage lenders accept fewer applications than those from similar whites.</p>
<p>o Unemployment and underemployment were the most important causes of poverty, yet African-American unemployment has remained twice as high as white unemployment during each of the four decades since 1968. About 37 million Americans live in poverty, while 46 million Americans are without health insurance.</p>
<p>o Educational disparities remain linked to funding. The wealthiest 10 percent of school districts in the United States spend nearly 10 times more than the poorest 10 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> &#8220;There is no war against poverty in America,&#8221; said [Maureen] Taylor, the state chairwoman of the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization. &#8220;There is a war against the poor. We have to go and change the circumstances of poverty.&#8221;</p>
<p>But others are still optimistic. A Detroit News poll found six in 10 African-Americans said they feel blacks have made at least some economic progress since 1967.</p>

			<p>Much in the way of African privilege has occurred since the 1960&rsquo;s but they have been too stoned, too drunk, in jail too long, or involved in active crime to fully exploit every break they got.</p>
<p>Meanwhile rights have shrunk for Whites but we continue to run cirlces around them even with the media, government, and ever-present specter of their waves of violent crime against us.</p>
<p>If I had any sympathy for their plight in 1968, I sure as hell don&rsquo;t now. </p>

			<p>What have black people done to improve their OWN status in America? Do they just expect Whites to set them up on every level? They have every rights everyone else has in this country and maybe more due to their &#8220;protected&#8221; class. They pat themselves on the back when they succeed, and blame &#8220;whitey&#8221; when they fail. They are truly the White Man&rsquo;s burden!<br>

			<p>So, what is so suprising about these alleged facts? I am living through the decay of my own town. I have seen my schools which I once attended deteriorate beyond recognition. Our streets and parks are unsafe and whites leave daily for the suburbs. What once was a sleepy little suburb of Kansas City is rapidly becoming a ghetto. In another few years my town will ne just like Alanta, New Orleans or any other major American city where blacks have taken over by their sheer numbers. And some people can&rsquo;t understand why there is a racial gap.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;There is no war against poverty in America,&rdquo; said [Maureen] Taylor, the state chairwoman of the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization.</p>
<p>Then where did the hundreds of billions spent on welfare, public housing, food stamps, etc. for the last four decades go? </p>
<p>If the current system isn&rsquo;t helping people get out of poverty then the system needs a complete overhaul.</p>

			<p>Lets examine Detroit since the 1970s. A black corrupt mayor who chases all the whites away and battles constantly with the burbs, who despite the city going down the drain was reelected over and over again because he was black. Now you have a city that is extremely black with blacks filling just about every position of power. So whose fault is it other than blacks?</p>
<p>The article states things like misdirected funds and miseducation but doesnt say who is doing the misdirecting and miseducating because that would fall directly on the black leaders and we cant say that. I bet the 8 million Kwame used to payoff the lawsuit over his affair could have helped education.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The commission&rsquo;s grade on progress across the country for African-Americans: D+.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sixty years of testing, off all ages and income groups, all over the world, has conclusively proven that Africans on average have low IQs.  Hence, even though the USA has spent Billions and Billions of Dollars on the War on Poverty, on education, on affirmative action, and on aid to Africa, we see very little success.  Nor will we ever see success, because it is impossible for most Africans to meet the demands of a modern, technology driven culture.  That is not to say that a certain percentage of highly intelligent Africans cannot achieve   &mdash;   and many do.  But, the problem is not that elite group.  The problem is the sizable lower end of Africans with low intelligence, who drag down society.  100 years from now, if there is still a USA, we will still be bemoaning the low achievement of Africans.   </p>

<p>You are not better off, old boy, because you&rsquo;re still the same dysfunctional race.  Nothing will change that&hellip;..ever.  That&rsquo;s what your problem is.</p>
<p>How disgusting is it that blacks and white disturbed liberals won&rsquo;t admit what thousands of tests, and everyday life experiences reveal to be true, which is that blacks are not intelligent enough nor do they have the necessary abilities to compete in a first world society.</p>
<p>Of all the races in the world, they are last in tests of all kinds, including I.Q.; last in contributing anything useful to humanity; last in working to improve themselves, etc., but first in crime and violence, yet they have the audacity to claim that the reasons they are so far behind everyone else is due to injustices against them.</p>
<p>This whining and denial will continue until we are rid of these inept malcontents for good, and we should work towards that end by any means possible.<br>

<p>I guess the Washington D.C. Public School System would be a prime example to cite in order to back up the preceding assertion.  If I&rsquo;m not mistaken that school system has consistently been in the top five nationally in per pupil expenditures for decades.  But then again, it costs more to run prisons than schools. Go figure.</p>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t they convene a commission to look into the issue of EPIDEMIC one-sided black on white racial atrocities in this country? Isn&rsquo;t that a problem? Or do white victims not matter?<br>
Want a taste of it, look here:<br>
<a href="http://www.newnation.org/Archives/Black-on-White-050201.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newnation.org/Archives/Black-on-White-050201.html</a><br>
You can also click toward the top on &#8220;black on white&#8221; and scroll through pages. Midway through each archival section that comes up you can click on another archival list. And another. And another.<br>
I wish that site would leave out some of the open (but understandable) angry expressions that cross the line (still less than the baseless inflammatory hate directed against all whites expressed by black delusinal racists who are widely accepted) and stayed a little more professional. And also focus solely on the REAL issue, black on white racial atrocities, leaving out the other distractions.<br>
Keep in mind that what that site lists is ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG: There are between one and two million white victims of violence at the hands of blacks EACH YEAR. The dirty little secret is that MOST of it would be categorized at &#8220;hate&#8221; crimes if the situation were reversed, but aren&rsquo;t, even though racial slurs are almost always used against the white victims, due to the double standard.<br>
Time for white to break the mental chains that keep them enslaved and passive and submissive, and take a lesson in loud in-your-face mouthiness from blacks, but unlike with blacks, WITH A FACTUAL PRESENT DAY BASIS AND JUSTIFICATION. </p>

			<p>One might reasonably ask what have blacks been doing in the past forty years to improve their lot in life? I don&rsquo;t see why it is the job of the U.S. government to babysit blacks. This mentality of black entitlement has to stop. The government cannot create some kind of panacea for blacks.</p>

			<p>The same can be said for Mexicans.  The eastern part of our town, which had more apartments that the other areas, has been taken over by Africans, Mexicans, Russians, Asians, etc.  </p>
<p>The neighborhoods, which back in the 1970&rsquo;s were stable, blue collar neighborhoods, are now run down and look like slums.</p>
<p>The schools are the same way.</p>
<p>We pour money into these schools from the school district and from the city itself - and what do we get?  More folks relying on someone else to pay for themselves and their choice of having kids they cannot afford.</p>

			<p>American Blacks have raised the perpetual resentment and persecution complex-factor to a universal art-form! These people are utterly without shame and consequently completely without honor as a whole. If the average Black person were even remotely honest in their apparaisal of their life experience they could not point to &#8220;racism&#8221; as a cause of their failrues on any level. Knowing this, their masters resorted several decades ago to this ludicrous nonsense about &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; so they could continue to celebrate their never-ending victimhood in perpetuity; without ever having to show so much as an ounce of tangible evidence of all this alleged White wickedness and bigotry!</p>
<p>It is peculiar that a people would willingly base their entire historical and cultural identity almost entirely upon resentment and victimhood. And many, perhaps most of these Blacks have been the recipients of almost boundless largesse on the part of the very people they accuse of being the cause of their perpetual misfortune. That this fact is appraently lost on nearly ALL American Blacks, rich or poor, is staggering to behold.</p>

<p>They are comparing a school in Urban Hawaii or Connecticut or something to a school in rural Arkansas. This came up when I was in college learning school teaching in Ohio. One day we spent the whole day learning facts about how urban, minority schools are shortchanged. After class I asked the teacher, &#8220;you do realize the city (minority) schools (of Cleveland, Toledo, Akron, Youngstown, Canton, Cincinnati, Dayton, and Columbus) in the area, all spend considerably more money per student than do their suburban counterparts?&#8221; She said she knew. &#8216;Education financing&rsquo; went on to be a big issue in the news - as if public schools in Ohio weren&rsquo;t spending more money per child on children of color than they were on whites. Everything always has to be the opposite with these people. They are so brainwashed, too, I do believe the poster above is right, they really could not be happy unless whites lie down and die. <br>

<p>No.  Having worked around blacks all my life, I&rsquo;d have to honestly say that most of them couldn&rsquo;t get by in our civilization without some kind of upreach program.  Same goes for the middle class.  Universities and colleges are turning out blacks who can&rsquo;t even string a sentence together properly and accountants who have to be closely monitored and audited.  Cutting off welfare would result in large scale riots, plundering and the burning down of their neighborhoods and then expecting &#8220;whitey&#8221; to rebuild them.  The only answer is total separation from these people on a reservation somewhere.</p>

			<p>It seems to me that most blacks become either a menace <br>
or a burden from their day of birth. They are heavily <br>
involved in every scam known to man. There are a few who <br>
are a credit to the community but they are so heavily <br>
outnumbered by the others. They aspire to live beyond <br>
their means which can only be accomplished by subsidies <br>
from the more productive segments. Just imagine switching <br>
the population of Haiti with say, Denmark or Taiwan. Is <br>
there any doubt what these places would look like in a <br>
few years. Few black-run institutions are succssful, yet <br>
much of this stupid, spoiled population would seriously <br>
consider electing a black, communist demagogue to the <br>
presidency. God help this nation - <br>

<p>As long as you mean that they (the blacks) are the ones who are on the reservation, then that would make sense. I have asked this before but why didn&rsquo;t subsequent presidents pick up Abe&rsquo;s reins on the recolonization idea? Surely, every one of them realized how important the issue was/is and how it might alter the future of the nation&hellip;.</p>

			<p>The Kerner Commission was chaired by former Illinois Governor Otto Kerner, who was later to spend time in jail for tax fraud and corruption. He was a liberal governor and boot-licker to Richard J. Daley, upon whom he depended for his political life. This report was typical of the liberal hogwash, whose bromide was, and still is, to throw money at every problem.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t somebody do a survey of the average salary of the black Detroit Tiger, Lion and Piston in 1967, and of every black player on those teams today? Then they can wave the report in the face of this Maureen Taylor.</p>
<p>LeBron James- a product of Cleveland&rsquo;s public schools- is making millions of dollars, and he never spent a day in college. Sounds real poverty-stricken to me. </p>

<p>What a strange headline.  Didn&rsquo;t the editor who wrote it realize how non-sensical it really is?  Would one normally expect that riots would help something?  Or that these riots in this particular case would close any of these &#8220;gaps&#8221;?  Let me suggest a similar headline:</p>

			<p> These people should be ashamed of themselves for the non-sensical things they&rsquo;re quoted as saying in this story. &#8220;There&rsquo;s no way against poverty .. there&rsquo;s a war against the poor.&#8221; Now what pray tell is that supposed to mean? If there&rsquo;s no &#8220;war on poverty,&#8221; then where did all those billions of dollars go that have been targeted to just such a war since 1967?</p>
<p> &#8220;It&rsquo;s something suburbanites want to ignore.&#8221; Right, Rev   &mdash;   we want to ignore it so much that we&rsquo;ve practically bankrupted this country trying to fix it, not to mention all the do-gooder bleeding-heart Whites who have worked, both for low pay and volunteer, to try to help you people convert the pigstys you&rsquo;ve made out of the inner cities into habitable areas again. Yeah, Rev, we just want to ignore it.</p>
<p> I notice that the hearings were held in Detroit, Newark and Washington, D.C., all glaring examples of cities overrun and ruined by blacks, both as residents and as the government. Just what did those setting up said hearings expect to find there   &mdash;   model suburban communities?</p>
<p> Finally, notice how the writer buried the only favorable comments about black progress in the last two or three paragraphs. But of course, news about black progress might help to take &#8220;Whitey&#8221; off the hook, and we couldn&rsquo;t have that now, could we?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know the exact number but it&rsquo;s huge and out of proportion to their actual numbers.   In the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission blacks comprise 46.4 percent of the employees.  I know ten years ago some talk show host was talking about blacks making up 50% of Federal Employees in the DC area.  We are basically paying taxes to pay them so they can say they pay taxes too!

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;40 years after riots filled urban cities across the country there is still a gap between blacks and whites in areas such as poverty, education, crime and unemployment</p>
<p>Of course these gaps wouldn&rsquo;t exist because Blacks ARE Blacks, right? I would urge ANYONE dumb enough to blame racism on the disparity in crimes by Blacks,  the poverty and educational disparities to visit a predominantly Black school. Ride public transportation in ANY city with a large Black population. Listen to the trash music Blacks can&rsquo;t let go of. Visit ANY maximum security prison   &mdash;   see the percentage of Black inmates. Read the REAL news stories of Black perpetrated crime   &mdash;   not the CENSORED garbage in our local newspapers. Best of all, talk to law enforcement officials and THEIR off-the-record comments. Then you&rsquo;ll learn WHY we have such gaps, and who&rsquo;s fault it really is!</p>
<p>We had this same line of bull droppings parroted by the news hacks after the Katrina refugees came to Houston. About how these &#8220;poor people&#8221; were steeped in a life-long cycle of poverty   &mdash;   while the lamenters managed to ignore and forget N.O. had a Black mayor, a predominantly Black administration, not to mention police and fire departments&hellip; Yet these Blacks couldn&rsquo;t get jobs. Couldn&rsquo;t compete in the job market against Hispanics and other immigrants. Couldn&rsquo;t get their offspring educated enough to hold real jobs. (Has ANYONE ever explained what the term &#8220;work ethic&#8221; is supposed to mean to Blacks?) How many Black mayors ever bothered to visit largely Black schools and TALK with the student body? Not just talk   &mdash;   but imparting the realities of life to them?</p>
<p>But this disparity issue, of course is NO DIFFERENT from what I&rsquo;ve preached all along. Blacks can&rsquo;t come face-to-face with the reality that THEY, THEMSELVES are the real source of their problems. It&rsquo;s always easier to scream racism, or to blame &#8220;the system,&#8221; come up with excuse after excuse&hellip; when their children already have a lengthy rap sheet by the time they&rsquo;re 18. When drug pushers, robbers and muggers are THEIR role models. When such a huge percentage of Blacks are in prison, or have been in prison   &mdash;   for crimes they&rsquo;ve committed.</p>
<p>Mention going to school, getting good grades, then a job   &mdash;   to the average Black teenage punk   &mdash;   and he&rsquo;d look at you like you&rsquo;re spouting gibberish! It&rsquo;s fashionable to blame collective Black failure on alcohol, drug availability. On the lack of suitable role models. On the fact so many Blacks grow up in single-parent family environments. But fashionable or not   &mdash;   these excuses are merely LAME EXCUSES in the end. The problem with Blacks being simply THAT THEY ARE BLACKS! But then they really are not one iota different from their African kinfolk   &mdash;   their equally primitive counterparts back on the Mother Continent!</p>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the Black gangsta culture. Tell this cynic, please, how MANY Black sports starts, knocking down ridiculous salaries have ever visited those city schools. To tell the kids that LEARNING, not skill with a ball&hellip; is the real escape route from life-long poverty? How many Black &#8220;entertainers&#8221; have ever tried to be a real role model for their peers? (No, we don&rsquo;t mean that suspected pedophile and his private amusement park either.) We have that circus act   &mdash;    of Oprah, funding a school for African Blacks   &mdash;   then us getting a good laugh over the scandals plaguing her school. Has it ever occurred to the illustrious Oprah   &mdash;   that she COULD do something for her people here? (Or is the truth simply that Oprah is cynical enough to understand no matter what you do for American Blacks, the general Black population is simply beyond help?) I can thank my parents that I was born White. I don&rsquo;t need to make excuses or whine about perceived racism. Nor do I buy into that sanctimonious claptrap about White Privilege, either!</p>

			<p>I actually recalling reading the 20 year follow up to the Kerner Commision report.  It was a very interesting piece of reading.  </p>
<p>Although it was written nearly 20 years ago my recollection is that the report had said that there was essentially no change in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>The book begins with the example of black men sitting unemployed at a street corner talking about how badly they need jobs circa 1968.  Fast forward to 1988 and the book claims the situation had essentially remained unchanged.</p>
<p>It was very interesting reading I look forward to reading the second follow up report.</p>

<p>The same people who brought you slavery in the 18th and 19th centuries are now bringing you illegal immigration in the 20th and 21st centuries. Where are most illegal immigrants employed? In the agricultural industry, either in the fields or the processing/packing plants.</p>
<p>I personally think that this was the real reason Lincoln was assassinated. The monied interests didn&rsquo;t want to give up their cheap labor and got rid of the main proponent of doing so.</p>

<p>At least I can provide an answer to the first question. That a large percentage of Blacks are working in the government sector   &mdash;   not just federal, but state and local levels   &mdash;   can be ascertained by visits to your city hall and other government offices   &mdash;   and by the degree of incompetence and inefficiency displayed by the government offices.</p>
<p>The bungling inefficiency of our federally-run post office being a prime example. Philadelphia&rsquo;s city hall another. No, do NOT expect good service from government offices. Whenever Black employees screw up, count on it being ignored and swept under the proverbial rug.</p>

<p>Sorry, TACITUS, but permit me to suggest you are WRONG! The premise, slaves were cheap labor, is inherently wrong. Given the need for huge militia groups in every slave state, ever alert and ready in the event of an uprising.</p>
<p>Blacks were notoriously inefficient compared to people working for wages. Both factors effectively dooming the institution of slavery long before 1864 ended it. Lincoln, fully aware that Blacks were unfit to live among Whites, intended to ship them to Liberia after the Civil War. A pity he did not live long enough to see his plan come to fruition. America surely would be the better for it, had this happened!<br>

<p>Quite right. Blacks do not plan ahead. My theory (probably already espoused by another) is that Africans are not as intelligent as Whites, due to environmental factors, which cause the evolution of the African Race to be inherently less intelligent (but physically superior) than other races. Darwin&rsquo;s &#8220;Survival of the Fittest&#8221; theory, and selective breeding would lead Africans to focus on physical development, rather than intellectual advancement. </p>
<p>Africans live(d) hand to mouth. Each day they could/would go hunting for that day&rsquo;s sustenance. Winters are mild in Africa, and game abundant. There has never been any need to plan ahead for a  harsh Winter. It was, however, very important that Africans be fast and strong (good traits in hunters with bows/spears/etc) Conversely, Whites, and many Asians, had to plan ahead for the Winters, in order to survive through to Spring. Survival required forethought and intelligence. The intellectual development demanded by these harsher environments lead to systematic natural selection for these traits.</p>
<p> This is theory plays out in the observaton of various sports, in which Black athletes dominate. Games that require intelligence to triumph - Whites excel. </p>
<p>This does not mean, blacks are less worthy of life - it simply means there are differences in the inherent abilities of the Races, Lets cease to pretend there aren&rsquo;t any differecnest. Let the members of each Race do what they are best suited to,  rather than trying to force fit a square peg into a round hole </p>
<p> Finally, nobody should believe that all Blacks are un-intelligent. Some are very bright. &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; of intelligence is skewed left of other races. Let&rsquo;s not waste precious educational resources on the majority of Blacks. Spend it where it makes sense.</p>

<p>Were WhiteLiberal even remotely correct, his beliefs would be reinforced and supported by the African nations operating without White influence or control. The quagmire of corruption, crime and disease-riddled countries in Sub-Saharan Africa speak eloquently for the OPPOSITE!</p>
<p>WhiteLiberal is welcome to call me &#8220;a racist joke&#8221; since he has his head planted firmly in what would be a biological impossibility. HAS to have his head firmly up there&hellip; given the millions upon millions of Black examples we see, hear and read about. NEGATIVE examples by Blacks, including endless crime, racist rantings passing as speech, deliberate immersion in that &#8220;victimhood&#8221; mentality to the point they are unfit for rational thought, much less to be thought of as normal people.</p>
<p>It beats me how anyone, even a deluded liberal, can actually look around at today&rsquo;s Black population, in America, in Europe, in Africa   &mdash;   and believe that incredible liberal claptrap the liberals want, DEMAND, the rest of us to accept and believe!</p>
