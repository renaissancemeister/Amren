						<p>A white man was wrongly charged with rape on flawed DNA evidence, even though the victim said her attacker was black.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old was arrested after police carried out a cold case review on the assault of a teenage girl seven years ago.</p>
<p>Scientists tested a hair on the girl and came up with a match to the father of two. He was bailed, tagged and warned he faced a trial.</p>
<p>Yesterday, following a four-month ordeal, he walked free from court after the prosecution offered no evidence against him.</p>
<p>He was arrested last October after detectives reinvestigated the attack on the 17-year-old girl in Bexleyheath, Kent.</p>
<p>She was assaulted as she walked home after a meal with a friend in December 2001.</p>
<p>The offender grabbed her around the neck, dragged her into a garden where he ripped her clothes off and raped her.</p>
<p>She told her mother and police that her attacker was &#8220;black, large and tall&#8221;.</p>
<p>The arrested man is white, 5ft 5in and slim and said he had not been to Bexleyheath.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Lisa Wilding told Southwark Crown Court: &#8220;This case has an extremely unusual aspect to it in that the description given of her assailant by the complainant is of a large, tall, black man, which this defendant is clearly not.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DNA arises from a hair caught within the clasp of a ring worn by the complainant.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not from an internal swab, it is external from a hair, and that further reduces the significance of the DNA evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The case has been very carefully reviewed and in the circumstances the Crown offers no evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenny Hart, defending, said of her client: &#8220;He had no idea how a hair from his head, if it can be a hair from his head, had got into her ring.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said her client had been a hospital porter at one time and the first time the victim noticed the hair in her ring was during a hospital visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, not only has the complainant said herself it was a black man, totally different weight and height to that of the defendant, but five hours later the complainant&rsquo;s boyfriend spoke to the mother and the mother said: &lsquo;My daughter&rsquo;s been raped by a black man.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was formally cleared of rape but asked a judge to prevent his identification because he feared that naming him would lead to harmful repercussions.</p>
<p>Judge John Price ruled that he had no power to make such an order but asked the media to abide with the man&rsquo;s wish.</p>
<p>He said he had much sympathy for the defendant, who had &#8220;undergone months of distress and concern before finding today there is no evidence to be offered against him, because there is no evidence&#8221;.</p>
<p>Judge Price added: &#8220;He is a man who leaves this court with no blame whatsoever.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a wholly innocent man, who might have been the victim of a gross miscarriage of justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the CPS said: &#8220;We charged on the basis of DNA evidence which we were satisfied with.</p>
<p>&#8220;We asked for further tests and in light of the results we decided that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why the British Government just doesn&rsquo;t declare all-out war on &#8220;white males&#8221; - it&rsquo;s certainly heading that way!</p>

			<p>The FBI lists crimes committed by Hispanics as crimes committed by whites as part of a communist agenda to make Hispanics appear to be law abiding Saints while demonizing whites.  Since most FBI employees are blacks they are playing one race against another knowing all the while that blacks commit a grossly disproportionate percentage of crimes totaling much more than those committed by Hispanics and whites combined.  If the FBI thought it could get away with it they too would probably attempt to arrest, frame and convict whites for crimes committed by their fellow blacks&hellip; </p>

			<p>In case no one has noticed there&rsquo;s a war on whites in all countries. The sad part is, its the white countries that have the most anti-white agenda! The main goal is the genocide of the white race and has been for centuries. When a people avoid what other people tell them what they would like to do to them,and prove it by their actions the one race in behind the eight ball,and only a leader can awaken them before its to late.</p>

			<p>So a white victim clearly describes her rapist as a tall, large black male and the UK authorities arrest and prosecute a short, slender white male.</p>
<p>You would think if the authorities were able to recover the wrongly-accused&rsquo;s hair under the victim&rsquo;s ring, they would have also recovered much more ample, contradicting evidence from the victim&rsquo;s other body parts.  How could forensics not realize the racial differences in the recovered DNA samples?  How could no one in this legal sham realize the inconsistency in DNA samples versus the clear physical description of the perp?  How could the prosecution choose to proceed with a case while ignoring the contradicting evidence? </p>
<p>Incomptence on the part of all the authorities?  I think there is a better chance of finding a pink elephant.</p>
<p>More likely, I suspect dreaded political correctness. The prosecution finally got that elusive white rapist to make their crime stastics more equitable. It seems the UK authorities might be more concerned with charges of racism than actually catching criminals.</p>
<p>I shudder to think how many other horrific deeds the real black criminal committed as the police were on a wild goose chase looking for Whitey.</p>
<p>I hope the white male sues the heck out of all involved in this travesty.<br>

			<p><i>Victim said perp was black. British police arrest a white man.</i></p>
<p>I am not surprised. They were, probably, color-blind.</p>
<p><br>
Expect more of such nonsense in any &#8220;color-blind&#8221; society.<br>

			<p>&#8220;She told her mother and police that her attacker was &ldquo;black, large and tall&rdquo;.  The arrested man is white, 5ft 5in and slim and said he had not been to Bexleyheath.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, why not?  After all there is no such thing as &#8220;race&#8221;.</p>
<p>And apparently, there is no such thing as &#8220;height&#8221; or &#8220;weight&#8221; either.</p>

			<p>[A white man was wrongly charged with rape on flawed DNA evidence, even though the victim said her attacker was black. A spokesman for the CPS said: &ldquo;We charged on the basis of DNA evidence which we were satisfied with.&#8221;]</p>
<p>Yes, and this is blaring evidence on how little it takes to satisfy them.</p>
<p>An unbiased committe should be formed at once to determine why these people didn&rsquo;t insist on executing the innocent man anyway, since they were fully aware the perpetrator was black, but gleefully opted to charge a white man.  And when the reasons are known they should give the authorities responsible white insensitivity training which will assure the next time they will refuse to allow the facts to get in the way and will continue to press to have the charges pursued in their kangaroo courts, which is bound to delight them to no end.</p>
<p>And, very proudly, hanging above their politically correct doorway they should be allowed to place a large sign with their motto on it:  &#8220;Let no innocent person escape.&#8221;</p>

When you get into civil court the lawyers, judges, and court reporters all work together to strip the assets from the innocent white man. There is no lie they will not tell, nor is anything they do considered criminal&hellip; and the lawyers, judges and court reporters are &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>
<p>How can this situation be rectified?</p>
<p>Those who have not been into court have no idea how corruption is defined.<br>

<p><a href="https://www.globalpolitician.com/23601-race-multiculturalism" rel="nofollow">https://www.globalpolitician.com/23601-race-multiculturalism</a></p>
<p>The Age of White Masochism</p>
<p>I suspect future historians will call this era the Age of White Masochism. The white man conquered the world and then suffered a nervous breakdown, a kind of collective neurosis shared by an entire civilization. However, I sense that this era is slowly coming to an end.</p>
<p>I would use two arguments as to why the current mass immigration the West should be halted:</p>
<p>1. Whites, too, have a right to exist. The primary duty you have as a human being is to preserve the heritage of your ancestors and pass on to your children a country they can call their own and where they can live in dignity.<br>
2. The ongoing immigration is population dumping where less successful cultures dump their population in more successful ones. This is a form of global Communism and will generate the same effects by destroying successful communities and centers of excellence.</p>
<p>I believe whites in the 21st century should desire a room of our own where we can prosper, live in a major Western city without having to fear violence because of our race, and without being stripped of our heritage in order to placate people who moved to our countries out of their own free will. We have the right to preserve our heritage and are under no obligation to commit collective suicide or serve as a dumping ground for other countries. It has nothing to do with animosity towards others. For my part, I am being entirely honest if I say that I still love visiting other cultures, but I will love this even more if I know I can also return to my own.</p>
