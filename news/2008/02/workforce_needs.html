						<p>AUSTRALIA has to increase immigration to meet future labour force demands, two academics have warned.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of an ageing population and predicted economic growth, their paper estimates that 227,000 migrants will be needed annually by 2021.</p>
<p>Written by leading demographer Peter McDonald and economist Glenn Withers, the paper warns that Australia is unprepared for labour market demands. It calls on the Government to establish an independent inquiry into how immigration can meet those demands.</p>
<p>The paper, Population and Australia&rsquo;s Future Labour Force, says the demand for unskilled labour should be tackled, arguing that a tightly administered guest worker scheme be considered to allow Pacific islanders to fill low-skilled jobs where there are shortages.</p>
<p>A record 177,600 people settled in Australia in the past financial year.</p>
<p>The paper predicts the resources boom and investment in new facilities will increase pressure for immigration. Demand for skilled workers in mining, transport and communications will increase as baby boomers retire. &#8220;In the next 20 years, the only potential sources of increases in labour supply are increased labour force participation rates and immigration,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p>The paper highlights labour shortages in hospitality and primary industry. It says caps on unskilled migration should stay, but a modest scheme that allows Pacific islanders and East Timorese to fill low-skilled jobs could enhance development in the Pacific through an exchange of remittances and skills.</p>
<p>&#8220;A new Pacific Compact could now replace the Pacific Solution used by the former coalition government, whereby island nations are paid to provide refugee processing service support for Australia,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p>The paper was released by the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia. South Australia has begun an aggressive advertising campaign in Britain to attract immigrants.</p>

<p>I fail to see how the shortages in the VERY SPARSE mining, transport and communications jobs are going to require bringing in 200,000-plus immigrants a year?  That is absolute GARBAGE!</p>
<p>This is just one more excuse for them to destroy Australia the same way they have destroyed Britain.</p>
<p>They want to bring in a bunch of third-world TRASH to destroy our culture and change our lives for the worst. That&rsquo;s all their is to it!!!</p>

			<p>This falls under the &ldquo;How Come?&rdquo; Department. </p>
<p>How come the experts tell us that we&rsquo;re running out of oil even though there is an unlimited supply?  Tapping into it will upset the environment, they claim.  So we must stop using it.  And we must find an alternative!</p>
<p>Next day these same experts tell us that we are running out of cheap labor, but now we don&rsquo;t have to stop using it and we don&rsquo;t have to find an alternative.  It&rsquo;s OK to tap into the unlimited supply.  Even though tapping into it will destroy our environment. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two ways to be consistent.  <br/>
We&rsquo;re dependent on oil.  Stop using it, technology will supply an answer.<br/>
We&rsquo;re dependent on cheap labor.  Stop using it, technology will supply an answer.  </p>
<p>Do away with easy use of the auto this will ruin the middle class white man&rsquo;s life.<br/>
Wipe out white America by immigration; this will ruin the middle class white man&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>You see even though the liberal experts seem to crazy, they are crazy like a fox<br/>

<p>I would like some &#8216;leading&rsquo; demographer and some &#8216;leading&rsquo; economist to explain to me how Europe and China (and every other country through history that suffered catastrophic population loses) survived after the Black Death.</p>
<p>The problem is that our modern economies are little more than Ponzi schemes that rely on an increase in populations to fund aging populations and those dependent on welfare programs. More must be imported to pay for ever increasing population demands.</p>
<p>But ALL Ponzi schemes eventually collapse because they can&rsquo;t keep growing. At some point, you can&rsquo;t get enough money coming in at the bottom to pay for the payouts at the top. No western welfare based economy can survive in the future by depending on increased populations to cover increasing costs.</p>
<p>Importing more people won&rsquo;t solve the problem. It&rsquo;s only going to transfer new problems to the future just as slavery in the past did for us in the present.</p>
<p>There comes a time when the bill comes due. The payment will be with money, social collapse, or most likely both.<br/>

<p>If Australia wants to increase it&rsquo;s population there is a time tested way to do so, which is really quite fun.  </p>
<p>If they want more immigrants maybe they should rid themselves of marxists, establish a  free land, and advertise those Whites of all lands that they&rsquo;re welcome. </p>

			<p>So you would have to build a new city of a million people every four years. This in a country of water shortages.</p>
<p>Supposedly, this is to fill the &#8216;vacant&rsquo; jobs.  But every thousand new migrants create the need for new positions in nursing, policing, teaching, house building etc.  To fill one vacant job you have to create five more, who all expect to be looked after by immigrants when they retire. </p>

			<p>WHITES NEED TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN.</p>
<p>This is bad news that Australia has to import cheap labor, because to the &#8220;aging whites&#8221; did not have enough children in the first place.  </p>
<p>But immigration will not solve the problem.  It may solve the labor shortage, but it will create crime, congestion, pollution, terrorism, rapes, murders, poverty, unemployment, disease and death.</p>
<p>It like selling your kidneys.  You are rich overnight, but then you get weaker, tired, and your other kidney starts shutting down and you descend into a quicker death.</p>
<p>That is immigration, at least 3rd world immigration  &mdash;  the financial benefit of cheap labor is an illusion masking the reality of a slow inexorable death.</p>
<p>Whites need to have more children.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what they ALWAYS say. Interesting how they&rsquo;ve managed to tie  &#8220;economic growth&#8221; to an &#8220;aging population&#8221;. I would have thought an aging population would cause an economic downturn due to older people working less and spending less. Ah, but that&rsquo;s it, isn&rsquo;t it? Companies want to keep their bottom line from shrinking, so they have to encourage NEW customers to come into the country. </p>

			<p><i>Against the backdrop of an ageing population and predicted economic growth, their paper estimates that 227,000 migrants will be needed annually by 2021.</i></p>
<p>This is as absurd as it gets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mathematical fact that in a society with stable population and low infant mortality, the average population age is roughly half of the average longevity. As a result, &ldquo;aging population&rdquo; may only be &ldquo;remedied&rdquo; by shortening average lives, an increase in infant mortality, or perpetuating exponential population growth; each of the above quite unacceptable, if not outright inhumane. The latter (perpetual population growth) can be easily accomplished by abolishment of birth control. &ldquo;Importing&rdquo; foreign labor is just a slap in a face of those who refrained from having more that 2.1 kids per couple.</p>
<p>An &ldquo;aging population&rdquo; is a sign of well-being of a society, and not pathology as many liberal agitators and morons want us to think.</p>

			<p>sbuffalonative and Anon at 8:17. Absolutely right. Immigration creates its own need for ever more immigration. A credit card with an interest rate that forever increases. Ponzi scheme it is. The answer is to never buy into the lie in the first place. Close the door on the snake oil immigration salesmen and walk away. Zero immigration is how to manage your house responsibly, so as to live within your means and provide for your own future. Guest workers and temp workers are the wrong answer. The guests  never leave, and temporary never ends. Immigrants are the wrong answer for any problem. Very wrong.</p>

			<p>Economists have been telling young Australians for years that there are not enough unskilled jobs to go around. My home state of Victoria recently raised the school leaving age for this reason.</p>
<p>The only industry lobbying for unskilled labour from the Pacific Islands that I know of is fruit-picking. This, however, is only seasonal work. </p>
<p>An Australian parliamentary enquiry in 2006 reported that growers liked the idea of Pacific Islander labour but weren&rsquo;t willing to pay a levy to help fund the real costs involved.</p>
<p>The Australian Farm Institute also declined to support a Pacific Islander labour scheme. The Institute found that farming required an increasingly skilled labour force; that cheap labour would encourage unproductive farming practices; that the industry needed to professionalise; and that a difficulty in finding labour was due to low pay and lack of a career structure rather than to an absence of potential workers.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>This number roughly equates to the number of whites fleeing the UK every year so many of them will being going to Australia.</p>
<p>The balance will be made up of other Europeans as Australia now has re-established a preference for white immigrants having swiftly realised the perils of multiculturalism.</p>

			<p>The strange fact is that Australia&rsquo;s current economic boom - and thus demand for migrants workers - is entirely down to China&rsquo;s huge appetite for minerals and commodities, and its economic clout in being able to pay hard cash for the said materials.<br/>
Just a few years back, Australia was restricting immigration.<br/>
It is just one example of how quickly things can change in World politics.</p>

			<p>Depends where the immigrants are coming from and their level of skill and basic intelligence</p>
<p>From the UK&hellip;sure fine&hellip;.but from Pacific nations and East<br/>
Timor which are economic/social  basketcases with open<br/>
gang warfare in the latter, that is a real worry <br/>
This also reminds me of our refugee policy where we have recently taken in thousands of Africans with the all the predictable resulting problems.<br/>
But now that there numbers have been temporarily reduced due<br/>
to`assimilation issues`(haha) we are now told to take more in from &hellip;guess where?  .Iraq! of all places<br/>
Holy Allah! this does not bode well for our great countrys future.Can already see some potential suicide bombers<br/>
gestating in the fetuses about to be unleashed on our<br/>
`sunburnt country`  </p>
<p>Demographics are indeed the key and the fathers of the White Australia immigration policy were far sighted enough (as their  cousins in the US)to keep it relatively that way until the end of the 1960s/early 1970s</p>
<p>Now the floodgates are opening up and more race based disturbances are becoming much more common in the bigger cities here  as we let more `refugees` in along with some of these questionable `migrants` <br/>
Echoing Madame Pompadour  all I can now say is<br/>
`After us the Deluge!</p>

			<p>New non-white immigrants arriving from third-world countries will go to their graves with whatever culture they brought with them.  Their offspring will internalize the alleged greatness of their parent&rsquo;s homeland and reject the culture of the host nation, because being non-whites they know intuitively they will forever be perceived as second-class citizens.  These alien offspring strike out against the host people and culture they despise and their hatred is fueled by the self-loathing they feel born of a lack of courage and conviction to return to the land of their ancestors where they belong&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;227,000? If nobody has an abortion this year, I make that over three years&rsquo; worth of immigrants they won&rsquo;t need. </p>
<p>Make this your bumper sticker: Immigrants do the jobs abortions will not do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&gt; The real problem is world overpopulation.  The need to keep an ever expanding economy expanding is the problem.  At some point, we are going to have to &#8220;bite the bullet,&#8221; and slow down.</p>
<p>Regardless of what one poster wrote here, the earth is not a limitless entity, and oil is not limitless either.  Come on, let&rsquo;s make sense.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;How do Japan, Finland, S. Korea and Iceland remain such developed nations without immigration? And why isn&rsquo;t encouraging higher Aussie birth rates promoted as a solution?&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Randy at 10:10 AM on February 7 </p>
<p>Randy, with all respect you obviously don&rsquo;t know what is going on in these countries, including Iceland, which has a growing immigrant population.  Japan has a growing concern for population collapse and Finland is well on its way to destroying itself just as England and Sweden - and many other Northern European countries are doing.</p>

			<p>Ah yes, the great bogeyman of supposed labor shortage.  But here&rsquo;s the rub: if the population declines, then there will be less consumers, and thus less labor services will be required in the nation.  That&rsquo;s why an economy always fits the population size of the society.</p>
<p>In any event, why is immigration the only solution to this supposed problem?  How about a push to increase white procreation??  A baby boom among whites now will result in a wave of new White labor in 18 - 25 years.  </p>

Alas the Finnish elite also has gone mad and wants more immigrants and preferably from muslim countries and Africa where they plan to establish recruitment centres. One of the most appalling ideas is to let non-EU citizens ie muslims and African blacks to enter Finland and start job hunting for three months. I bet they will never leave.</p>
<p>The idea is to import cheap labour. Also multiculture seem to be the goal. Of course there are a lot of unemployed Finns.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;aging population&#8221; excuse is used in every Western Nation as an excuse for massive immigration. The fact is, the assumption that massive immigration into Western Nations is needed as a consequence of an aging population,is highly questionable in modern societies of the twenty first century. Advanced mechanization, better health into longevity, and other factors too numerous to mention, seem to suggest that there is no rational reason to radically increase the population of most Western nations. The stated goals of the elites for massive immigration, are not their real goals.</p>

			<p>The idea that any nation needs to keep increasing population is a giant lie.  For example, Australia could be extremely viable with a population of 4, as long as they produced something that could be sold to people of other nations.  It is not the number of people that matters, but the amount of productivity (profit) that can be produced per person.  </p>
<p>Quite frankly, I&rsquo;d rather have a low population of highly successful, technological Europeans (with some unspoiled natural areas remaining) than teaming endless mega-cities of crowded festering third worlders, wallowing in pollution and misery.  </p>
<p>In the USA, productivity and profit ultimately fall, as highly productive Europeans are replaced by low-productive AmerIndians and Africans.   </p>

			<p>Anytime some person or entity identifies a &#8220;labor shortage&#8221; issue for a nation that can only be solved by immigration you can bet there is another agenda behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I frankly believe that there is an active conspiracy promoting mass immigration to the Western / white nations.  The probability that this is occuring in virtually all Western nations at this same time without an underlying caustive factor is very remote.</p>
<p>Update, if you all thought that Mitt Romney was the answer to the immigration issue forget it.  The quote below is straight from his web site.  Notice he wants to recruit &#8220;skilled workers&#8221;.  It does not take a Phd to figure out that the definition of &#8220;skilled workers&#8221; is whatever the sponsoring employer defines them to be.  It appears that Mitt also believes that we do not have enough student visa holders in our universities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Encourage Legal Immigration. Streamline the system to recruit and retain skilled workers and welcome the best and the brightest from around the world to our universities.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Migrant workers are not robots existing in a vaccuum. They all bring in their wives, numerous children and extended family relatives. You may gain one worker but have to spend thousands educating his many children etc; it is a poor trade-off.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No they don&rsquo;t. All they need to do is what their ancestors did for a few centuries and that is for White women have more WHITE children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe more white women would have children if white men were more willing to commit.</p>

			<p>I know this is a general statement, however, Australian women are materialistic, not maternalistic.  The last thing on their minds is producing white babies.</p>
<p>Looking around my once great city of Sydney you rarely see pregnant white women.  However, one sees plenty of Asian women with big tummys, as well as Pacific Islanders, Indians/Pakistanis/Sri Lankans/Bangladeshis, black Africans (in rapidly increasing numbers) and of course who wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without our star migrants, the muslims.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but the majority of Australians are too obsessed with material goods to notice what&rsquo;s going on here.  We have a new (Chinese speaking) Prime Minister now, so God help us all.</p>

			<p>This just shows you how short-sighted some economists are. I DON&rsquo;T MEAN FOR THIS TO SOUND CRASS. Let&rsquo;s say you have a disproportionately large cohort of 60-90 year olds with fewer workers in the 30-60 age brackets. This is a problem for thirty years and then corrects itself naturally. The smaller 30-60 cohort that replaces it after 30 years will end the problem. Letting in hordes of non-White immigrants, their extended families and their offspring is going to be a problem lasting not 30 years but forever. Another feature of a declining birthrate is that less money need be spent on schools. Most people don&rsquo;t begin making an economic contribution until they are about 25. So the extra money spent on a larger old cohort is shifted from the money saved by a smaller younger one. The immigration argument is a canard for ethnic communities and cheap labour advocates.</p>

			<p>Although Australia is a huge country on the map, its ecumene is very small and it suffers from severe water shortages. A larger population is not very feasible.</p>

			<p>Proud Austrailian,I think your right. You have explained why the once proud and solid white Western World is collapsing. The real and permanent values of family life being replaced by the transitory and empty values that the pursuit of materialism creates is what is causing it. </p>

			<p>So-called &#8220;labor shortages&#8221; is just a red herring to divert attention away from the real reason to re-populate and replace existing White nations throughout the world.</p>
<p>At a mere 10%&hellip; Whites are the true minority on this planet and the ultimate aim is to flood the remaining &#8220;white&#8221; countries with massive loads of the &#8216;other&rsquo; 90% with help from politicians who would sell their first-born white baby for a dollar. </p>
<p>According to the United Nations world population prospects, global population growth is driven by developing countries. This frightening event is like a run-away train that can&rsquo;t be stopped. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure many Amreners have already seen Roy Beck&rsquo;s well known video on the astonishing immigration numbers, but I&rsquo;ll include it here for those who&rsquo;ve not viewed this important 14 minute video.</p>

			<p>How Ironic. We are told Australia &#8220;needs&#8221; more migrants. And then right above that story there is another AmRen article about the problems migrants and their 70 langauges are causing the police in Australia. Ironic indeed.</p>
