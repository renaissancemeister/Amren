						<p>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. &mdash; A sign at a gas station notifying students at the predominantly black Bethune Cookman University of a new rule limiting their access to the business is being called racist and has prompted a boycott.</p>
<p>The sign, which reads &#8220;B.C.C. &mdash; 1 Student At A Time,&#8221; is posted on the door of a Citgo gas station located at 600 West International Speedway Boulevard in Daytona Beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is racist,&#8221; a student said. &#8220;If it wasn&rsquo;t racist, why is it saying only one BCU student? Why isn&rsquo;t it saying Embry Riddle students? Or Stetson&rsquo;s students? Why is it just Cookman students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Managers said students from the school are stealing and the rule is meant to curb crime. They said they have lost hundreds of dollars a month in retail theft.</p>
<p>He blames Bethune Cookman University students for the crimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not about race, no,&#8221; store manager Michael Amid said. &#8220;If they come one at a time, we can have a sale.&#8221;</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s racist about it? A convenience store near my high school had a similar policy (but it was 2 at a time), and that was a mostly white school 20 years ago. </p>

			<p> I would say the store managers have studied surveillance videos, and that Embry Riddle and Stetson are predominantly White schools. Over a period of time, if most of the thievery was obviously being done by blacks, then it would follow that Bethune Cookman is the place to look for the guilty parties.</p>
<p> Also, I noticed that the last name of the manager quoted appears to be Arab. If so, that means he probably isn&rsquo;t afflicted with White Guilt like so many of us are. He apparently decided that if blacks from BC are doing the stealing, they are the ones to be watched closely and kept to limited numbers in the store. Sounds like simple logic to me.  </p>

<p>Maybe because it is mainly BCU students who are the ones stealing?  I never cease to be amazed at how rational thinking seems to be completely beyond the grasps of most blacks.  What is really sad is that these people doing the shoplifting aren&rsquo;t ghetto bums - they are college students, the supposed future leaders of the black community.  I guess Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s legacy will be in good hands.</p>

			<p>This is in large part the untold story of &#8220;whites only&#8221; exclusionary practices in the past. The best news for store manager Michael Amid has to be the boycott announcement. Such a blessing, if effective, should go far in eliminating the five-fingered discounts by the young scholars at Bethune Cookman University. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Everybody from Cookman University does not steal,&#8221; a woman said.</p>
<p>Prove it!</p>
<p>Experience tells us that a very large percentage of black teens are not only thiefs, they&rsquo;re troublemakers as well. </p>
<p>The presence of black teens invariably equals black crime and violence. </p>
<p>Quit whining about repurcussions taken for protection.  Clean up your group or all of you will suffer.</p>

			<p>Take my word for it, the sign will come down. If it doesn&rsquo;t, the store owner will start seeing rocks flying through his window. He WILL back down. Go to the original story and watch the video there and see the hysterical reactions to this. No one asking, of course, why blacks do tend to commit more crimes, according to every statistical measure known to man. </p>

			<p>When will business learn to endure the thefts from blacks while abandoning common sense?  Blacks expect you to be a victim of their pathetic impulse control and they know they&rsquo;ll get the  support of the main stream media. </p>
<p>After this business folds, the blacks will complain about how racist whites are for not establishing their businesses in the ghetto.  Black tribal leaders will then demand tax money to establish businesses in the ghetto, and they&rsquo;ll get it.</p>
<p>These businesses will eventually fold and it starts all over again.</p>
<p>See how it works? </p>

			<p>Whites need to where the accusation &#8220;Racist&#8221; as a badge of honor, as their empirically-derived discernment is proof that our eyes are not lying to us.  I see Black theft everywhere and I am not hallucinating.  But their &#8220;racist&#8221; accusation is a figment of their imagination, used to steal with impunity.<br>

			<p>Just another issue that blacks never address. This is their propensity for participating in crime. Black crime was the single biggest factor in the closing of the Bannister, Blue Ridge &amp; Indian Springs malls in Kansas City. Everyone knows this to be true but it would be racism to state the truth. The simple fact is that the whites just went elsewhere where it was safer to shop and their fellow customers has a sense of social graces. The latter of course is sorely lacking within the black culture.</p>

			<p>I had to laugh when I read this story. You can take the BCC story even further. We have an event in Orlando called the Classic. It pits BCC and some other Black college in a football game near the Thanksgiving holiday. One school is ghetto, the other is attitude non whites. (I&rsquo;ll let you figure out which is which.) Anyhow I worked in the restaurunt field roughly nine years ago. All of my staff would request that particular weekend off. Not knowing why and fairly short staffed, I had to work that weekend and soon discovered for myself exactly why. The thugs ran the streets with their hoopties, loud hate whitey music bassed enough to burst eveyone&rsquo;s eardrums, attempting to run any pedestrain over, had obnoxious attitudes and wore overwhelmingly ridiculous attire. We had tons of them in the restaurant- to the point where we had to appply chains and pad locks to the doors to prevent anymore from coming in. Somehow they still managed to break the chains and bust the locks. Picture this: tables of 15- 20 homies at tables that are supposed to accomodate only 5 -8 people. All are ordering water to drink and most are ordering small meals- 2 to 4 to be shared by these huge numbers of people. They would then find ANY reason to complain about the food quality to where I had no recourse but to give them the meals for free- what COULD I do in a restaurant where I was acting manager and had it full of these thugs? They wanted the free ride obviously. One had even the forethought to remove his steering wheel from his hooptie and have it chained to his wrist. Such class! We used to sell virgin strawberry daquiris, wonderful side salads, non refillable drinks like bottled rootbeer and always had a steady supply of lemons in stock. Miraculously the following year these items were no longer available at the time of this particular event. LOL. Last I heard, this restaurant had guards stationed during the event and had added tips of 15% to parties of more than 8, especially enforced due to this event. Most do not even know what a tip is. I even heard rumors from friends still in the service industry that they now break up into groups of 4- still trying to take over the entire restaurant and ask for separate checks. Crime rates jump up drastically in Orlando during this event EVERY year, with robberies seeming to be more prevelant in particular. It is no wonder to me being from Orlando- very near to Daytona Beach - that ANY shop owner would take such drastic measures.</p>

			<p>BTW, Tarik Minor (the reporter of the story) is the token black they send to report these stories- the apparently only black on the staff who feels safe reporting them. You find him reporting in the most ghetto of neighborhoods. I am sure he is constantly checking the news van with his staff to make sure it isn&rsquo;t being stolen as he is filming his report.</p>

			<p>Ya know&hellip;what happened to &#8220;We reserve the right to refuse service to ANYBODY&#8221; in America?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll often hear liberals say of the past, &#8220;I can&rsquo;t believe we live in a country where Blacks weren&rsquo;t shop in white owned businesses&#8221;&hellip;think about this&hellip;it isn&rsquo;t &#8220;the country&#8221; or &#8220;the government&#8221; that permitted or doesn&rsquo;t permit blacks to shop in whatever given business&hellip;IT&rsquo;S THE BUSINESS OWNER who decides who can and cannot shop in their businesses, in otherwords a PRIVATE citizen and owning a PRIVATE business making the decision. </p>
<p>So rather than following the Constitution and letting these things work themselves out over time among free citizens,such as blacks learning WHY whites don&rsquo;t want them in their businesses or schools and slowly self-correcting their offensive behaviour and perhaps creating some trust via experience and allying white fears and distrusts&hellip; instead the leftist liberal elements in America used the Supreme Court to shove un-Constitutional &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; laws down our throats and took away the right of free association and private businesses from choosing who will be their customers.</p>
<p>Civil Rights was a net loss for whites and a net gain for non-whites. They can&rsquo;t force whites to live with blacks, not yet, but they&rsquo;ve tried and are trying everything possible to force whites to live amongst blacks and send their children to unsafe schools with large numbers of blacks&hellip;but whites just will not tolerate living amongst blacks and keep moving away from them.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d suggest to anyone who does not want to contribute to the decline of their neighborhoods is to interview potential buyers before selling their home and decline to sell their home for ANY other reason besides race &hellip;and their are many legitimate reasons one can give, but just saying &#8220;i don&rsquo;t like them&#8221; or &#8220;i don&rsquo;t like their character&#8221; will suffice. When the leftists create specific categories that cannot be &#8220;discriminated&#8221; against, they leave open ALL of the reasons to &#8220;discriminate&#8221; and that can be simply someones opinion, as long as it&rsquo;s not race, nationality or age etc.</p>
<p>see what I mean?</p>

			<p>Why is it that these people cannot spell racist correctly.  </p>
<p>It is &#8220;R E A L I S T&#8221;.  I am not sure of the various laws in the US (and they often are different in each State from my working life there in the 1960s), but here in Europe, property owners, including public places such as shops have the &#8220;right of admission protection so they can keep &#8220;unsuitable visitors&#8221; out.</p>
<p>I would guess that anywhere, thieves would be covered by this heading.</p>

There&rsquo;s a medium sized grocery store in my neighborhood that has been here for years. There was never any problem that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>Since our neighborhood has &#8216;dieversified&rsquo;, they have installed security cameras and now employ a guard.</p>
<p>Before blacks and hispanics arrived, the store never had any need to security. Since we now have armed robberies (with automatic weapons carried by you-know-who) in my formerly majority white community, local businesses have taken to protecting their people and property.</p>
<p>Blacks and hispanics deny the truth about themselves.</p>

			<p>At some point, some capitalist made a conscious decision to build a C-store close to this ghetto campus. Greed probably told him that he could sell a lot of Newports, blunt wraps, bling, 40&rsquo;s, and other ghetto merchandise.  I am not so sure that I can sympathize with these kinds of capitalists.  The best thing this Arab can do before the Justice Dept. Civil Rights Div. comes down on him is to convert his operation into a window service only format and not let any customers in.</p>

			<p>Oh boo-freaking-hoo. I&rsquo;ll tell you why the store owner is banning only your school - because he&rsquo;s sick of losing merchandise to students from only your school!</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like it? Then quit trying for a five-finger discount every time you go to the store. A business has every right to ban people from a certain locale that have proven themselves to be untrustworthy.</p>

			<p>Quick geography lesson: Embry-Riddle is an aeronautical (pilot training) college located at the Daytona Beach airport. Stetson U. is in DeLand, about 20 miles to the west. So much for Stetson students patronizing this station.</p>
<p>The comments of &#8220;jenbelievesinwhites&#8221; are right on target, but I can add a bit more. The so-called &#8220;Florida Classic&#8221; (I call it the &#8220;Crime Bowl&#8221;) between BCC and Florida A&M; used to be played in Tampa. Businesses &amp; residents there finally got sufficiently fed up with the crime and other social pathologies the game caused to tell the organizers to go elsewhere. Unfortunately, the PC idiots running Orlando then invited this circus to their town. I&rsquo;ve long advocated that restaurants &amp; other businesses in Orlando stage a &#8220;general strike&#8221; during that weekend   &mdash;   stay closed from Friday until Monday. If enough of them take part, the game will have to move again. Where to? Well, the most convenient venue for the most alumni would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starke" rel="nofollow">Starke</a>. </p>

<p>1) It shows how blacks are incapable of connecting cause and effect. They rob and steal and are restricted because of &#8220;racism&#8221;. Only blacks would adopt this viewpoint. It is their flawed mentality at work here. Blacks can never admit the truth about themselves, even to themselves.</p>
<p>2) I bet the storeowner is probably quite happy at the &#8220;boycott&#8221;. He probably doesn&rsquo;t want their business anyways. As customers, blacks are usually more trouble then they are worth. </p>

<p>I used to work at a restaraunt too and you are 100% correct.  Whenever the local black college had their Homecoming Weekend, everyone tried to take off work.  Actually, since the town is mostly black anyway - almost every Saturday night was exactily as you described.  Everyone requested off.  They would come in large groups, order water, hang out for hours, complain about everything, and never tip. What really shocked me was the pure hatred and racism directed towards white employees. (Interestingly, the couple of waitresses we had who dated black men seemed to get the most angered by this. Go figure.) It eventually got so bad that we had to hire black managers just to deal with black customers and calm them down.  When things got really bad late at night, we usually turned the radio to the country music station and turn it up as loud as possible.  That usually got rid of them.  </p>

			<p>Take my word for it, the sign will come down. If it doesn&rsquo;t, the store owner will start seeing rocks flying through his window. He WILL back down. Go to the original story and watch the video there and see the hysterical reactions to this. No one asking, of course, why blacks do tend to commit more crimes, according to every statistical measure known to man.</p>

<p>Not only that I bet white liberals from Stetson and Embry Riddle will protest and/or boycott the store until this injustice is done away with.</p>

			<p>These black students are being taught by their black professors that it&rsquo;s OK to steal. Think of it as &#8220;reparations&#8221; for slavery:<br>
There is a widespread belief among blacks that laws should not apply to them: Laws are just white man&rsquo;s tools of oppression, you see. And likewise that blacks should be able to criminally victimize whites freely. This is now widely taught in law schools across the country as &ldquo;Critical Race Theory&rdquo;. A typical example is Regina Austin, a widely PRAISED black racist professor at University of Pennsylvania:<br>
<a href="https://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2168" rel="nofollow">https://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2168</a><br>
&ldquo;Austin pours scorn on such &ldquo;traditional values&rdquo; as &ldquo;conformity to the law,&rdquo; which she insists will &ldquo;intensif[y] divisions within the black community.&rdquo; Austin has also called on blacks to engage in outright lawbreaking, &hellip;&rdquo;<br>

			<p>Sheer racism! Blatant anti-Black racism   &mdash;   for a shopkeeper NOT to allow more than one Black student in at a time. But the propensity of Black youths to be thieves, start their criminal careers at an early age   &mdash;   should NEVER influence shopkeepers to deny them admission to their businesses. Never mind how many MILLION stories of crime by Black   &mdash;   children, youths, or adults we&rsquo;ve heard of in our lifetime.</p>
<p>The thefts, mindless vandalism and crimes suffered by the Daytona Beach business owners and managers is mirrored in ANY city with a large Black population. Oh, I beg your pardon! I forgot it is politically most incorrect, to utter such an unassailable truth!</p>

<p>The best way to handle them is to make it uncomfortable for them to come. If they behave the way they do, the waiters should very SLOWLY take care of them. Let them sit there forever. If they don&rsquo;t tip, they don&rsquo;t get service. The waiters should be curt. If they complain, the manager should tell them if they don&rsquo;t like it, go elsewhere.  If they get out of line, call the cops. Beat them at their own game.</p>

			<p>Living in the area I think it is racial. Thats the store that BCC students have been going to for year and in the actual newspaper the Daytona Beach Police department have only 2 accounts of theft and neither was proven to be BCC student who commited theft. African Americans make up almost all of there coustomers and the area knowns whats going on. The students have spoken on it evryone is involved and Its not looking to good for the Citgo station even now with the signs removed.</p>

			<p>Just because only two reports are made does not indicate how many thefts have occured- many retailers know the costs involved in actual prosecution of such little cases and won&rsquo;t prosecute for such small amounts. But little by little, the small thefts add up. These owners have noticed a pattern with their own eyes, so you can&rsquo;t really blame them. I wouldn&rsquo;t put too much faith in the newspaper accounts anyhow. They are the MSM anyhow and always have an agenda to &#8220;fan the flames&#8221; as it were. </p>
