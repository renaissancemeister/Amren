<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader and two-time presidential candidate, warned Wednesday that Democrats &#8220;could hurt themselves substantially, perhaps irreparably, in November&#8221; if fallout from the clash between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is not addressed quickly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;First, we must not allow people to exacerbate black-Hispanic tensions,&#8221; Jackson said in a lengthy phone interview from New York. &#8220;I think the differences there are exaggerated. You just can&rsquo;t characterize things as Hispanics for Hillary and blacks for Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black and Hispanic tensions, to whatever extent they exist, may be exacerbated, however, in the Texas primary on March 4, where, due to a complicated delegate-selection process, predominantly black districts have been awarded more delegates than predominantly Hispanic districts.</p>
<p>But Jackson said blacks and Hispanics are &#8220;all in one big tent&#8221; in America and their political relationship &#8220;is very substantial.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s second warning came over the use of superdelegates, those 795 or so Democratic big shots who are not elected in primaries or caucuses but get to cast a vote at the convention.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jackson said the final rift &mdash; which could prove the most difficult to heal &mdash; is genuine reconciliation between Obama and Clinton at the Democratic convention in Denver in August.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Racial justice is the key for the salvation of the nation, and that is fair game to discuss; it is a fair message,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;Blacks reaching out is not new; white receptivity is new. Barack is reaching out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just take some delight in the fact that we knocked down barriers, and now Barack and Hillary are open-field runners,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;A healthier, more secure, more mature America is emerging from race and gender shock.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;Hispanics&#8221; on the East Coast might tend for Obama, but that is because East Coast &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; tend to be Afro-Carribean and Mulatto-Carribean.  Chicanos/Mestizos, so far, seem to break for HRC.</p>

			<p>Jackson is going to have to fight a lot harder. &#8216;Diversity&rsquo; always comes at the expense, and only at the expense, of whites but I&rsquo;m beginning to see Hispanics as our natural allies in multirace-grab America. Our only allies. Politics can make strange and necessary bedfellows out of completely disinterested groups, as it does in places like our prisons too.</p>

			<p>This &#8220;one big tent&#8221; idea has me imagining the superdome after hurricane Katrina, with a lot more corpses. </p>
<p>I actually envy the Hispanics for not having to shoulder the blame for all that plagues the black community, but I certainly don&rsquo;t see them as allies like the poster at 6:04. Groups like LaRaza make it perfectly clear that their ultimate goal is to displace whites in the southwest altogether. </p>

			<p>The black and Hispanic leaderships want desperately to pretend they have something in common other than a hatred for whitey.  But it is a view not shared by the unwashed rank and file, who are at each other&rsquo;s throats constantly, and with each passing day it is in greater danger of collapsing in upon them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;First, we must not allow people to exacerbate black-Hispanic tensions,&rdquo; Jackson said&hellip;. &#8220;<br>
Hmmmmm. Wonder why there would be &#8220;tensions&#8221;? Couldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with things like:<br>
1.) Last summer, three Latinos, including a 12-year old boy, were killed execution-style by black suspects in South Los Angeles: Police said the victims had no gang ties and no known enemies.<br>
2.) A couple months ago, a 17-year old BLACK youth named Jonathan Banks ran up to a little 3 YEAR OLD Hispanic girl, Kaitlyn Avila, and SHOT HER DEAD, POINT-BLANK, FOR NO DAMN REASON, in front of her home in Los Angelos, as she returned with her dad (also shot) from a McDonalds.<br>
3.)In June, seven family members, including four children, were shot in their home by a black intruder. The victims, all Hispanic, were killed &ldquo;execution style,&rdquo; police said. It was the city&rsquo;s [Indianapolis] worst mass killing in 25 years.<br>
4.)In the Tifton Georgia area there were several massacres of Hispanic migrant workers where black gangs were breaking into Hispanic migrant workers&rsquo; trailer houses, raping and slaughtering them with BASEBALL BATS. Similar incidents occurred in other states.<br>
5.) A black sheriff&rsquo;s deputy in Bakersfield California was caught on videotape repeatedly shooting an Hispanic soldier on leave from Iraq COMPLETELY UNPROVOKED!<br>
6.) A black bar bouncer kidnapped an Hispanic girl law school graduate in New York City, tortured, raped, and murdered her.<br>
7.) A black serial rapist-killer called the &ldquo;Baseline&rdquo; killer preyed on Hispanic women in Phoenix Arizona.<br>
8.) An Hispanic tanker truck driver was attacked for no reason by a mob of black youths in Atlanta: His truck overturned as rocks crashed into his windshield. As he tried to crawl out he was viciously beaten by the black youths.<br>
9.) As featured on a recent report on MSNBC: A black gang in Memphis specifically targeted Hispanics. In one incident they came up to a Mexican couple in the parking lot of their apartment. The blacks shot dead the Mexican man right in front of his wife, for no reason. This was a stranger on stranger senseless cold blooded murder.<br>
10.) In Inglewood CA in January 2007, a mob of 15 blacks, while shouting racial slurs, attacked and viciously beat three Hispanic school girls: The three teens were held down by the black boys in the group as three or four girls kicked and punched each of them until they lay bleeding on the ground. The unprovoked attack continued in broad daylight until a passing woman threatened to call police and the assailants scattered.<br>
11.) In December 2007 in Lake Wales FL, near Orlando: A black male by the name of Leon Davis (30) kidnapped two Hispanic females at random, Juanita Luciano (23) and Ivonne Bustamante (26 and pregnant), locked them in a room, doused them down with a flammable liquid AND BURNED THEM ALIVE!!! This black male, Leon Davis, has been responsible for a LONG STRING of attacks and robberies upon Hispanics in the area. A week earlier he murdered two Asian Indian Hindus in Lake Alfred FL.<br>
12.) In a January 2008 random racial killing, near LA in Monrovia two black males walked up to two Hispanic girls and opened fire as the girls stood outside one of the girl&rsquo;s apartment. One girl, Salas, was killed. Her friend was injured. </p>
<p>And for decades all across the country, but especially in the South, there has been an epidemic of black predators preying on the most vulnerable Hispanic migrants, robbing and raping, knowing that these Hispanic migrants do not have bank accounts and carry cash and are reluctant to report any crimes against them to police.</p>

The rift is there, it has been, and it always will. If you have to take action to ask people to make the effort to be nice, it means any harmony or unity that emerges is tentative, suspect, and fragile. Real unity follows naturally, not by decree.</p>
<p>Good luck trying to hold the rainbow coalition together. As with real rainbows, they&rsquo;re tricks of light and perspective and when conditions change, they disappear.<br>

<p>The fact is (like several other posters have metioned) it will only be a matter of time that Latinos will begin to target usWhites as well. </p>
<p>Latino are more group identified that any other race, including Blacks. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right. As far as i&rsquo;m concerned the experience of Asian immigrants here in America demonstrates that everyone is not equal.</p>

			<p>Jesse Jackson (that name reminds me of something uncomplimentary) is living in dreamland. The Mexicans have no use for Blacks; Blacks generall are aware Mexicans are pushing the BLACKS out of the lower jobs. By taking jobs for lower wages; by having a much better work ethic than Blacks. An awareness not lost on business owners and corporate hiring managers.</p>
<p>Add to that the very visible friction resulting in killings of Blacks by Hispanics   &mdash;   and vice versa, you have an interesting scenario for what will support whom in this campaign.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen too many examples of black on non-black terrorism and violence and civil rights abuses.  Only the powerful and rich Bolsheviks are able to cover-up the atrocities by blacks against non-blacks.  I have consistently on this site been a proponent for justice.  Just look my name up.  I have harsh words for black killers and black civil rights abuses who commit crimes against us.  Jesse Jackson is a black racist preacher and is the reason I&rsquo;ve got a great animosity against civil rights shysters.</p>

The hate is there but just more acceptable.      </p>

			<p>Jackson&rsquo;s remarks can be translated simply, perhaps crudely, but not inaccurately as&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;We GOTTA unite, Blacks and Hispanics.  We just gotta!<br>
I mean, we&rsquo;ve got common ground, ie; A childish dependency on the very thing we intend to kill once we get what we want. Ya know, Whitey.  The longer we fight amongst ourselves the longer it will take to accomplish this mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>On another note though, does anyone really listen to this guy anymore?    </p>

Please tell us the truth about the engineered election fraud you have cooking and all the white prostitutes you have bedded. Pray do tell us stories about Jesus reverend.</p>

			<p>But Jackson said blacks and Hispanics are &ldquo;all in one big tent&rdquo; in America and their political relationship &ldquo;is very substantial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are reasons why Jackson wants then in one big tent. First he knows he can never shake them down for money over any imagined slight, the way he can with Whites. And second, he can continue his shake-downs under the guise of the rainbow coalition, any time the Hispanic community has a gripe. I think it is all for naught though, Hispanics feel no sense of kinship with Blacks, they do not want them in their neighborhoods, and they would rather have their own political representation.</p>
