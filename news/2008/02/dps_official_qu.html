<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Just 31.9 percent of Detroit students graduate in four years, according to the first major study in Michigan conducted using a method now mandated by the federal government.</p>
<p>The study, by the Education Policy Center at Michigan State University, looked at how many ninth-graders in Detroit and the state as a whole left high school with diplomas after four years. It portends what may happen in August, when Michigan releases the graduation rate for the class of 2007, which will be calculated for the first time using the same formula used by MSU researchers.</p>
<p>Detroit Public Schools officials would not comment on the study, which has not yet been published, but School Board President Carla Scott said she doesn&rsquo;t believe the results, which echo the findings of an Education Week study released in June. That study found fewer than a quarter of ninth-graders who entered Detroit Public Schools in 1999 graduated four years later.</p>
<p>According to the state Department of Education, the district&rsquo;s graduation rate for the same time frame was 66.8 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Statewide, the new study found the graduation rate in 2006 &mdash; 72.9 percent &mdash; was significantly lower than the state Department of Education&rsquo;s 85.7 percent graduation rate for the class of 2006, the last year for which data is available.</p>
<p>Sharif Shakrani, director of the Education Policy Center at MSU and the author of the study, said researchers looked at the total number of freshmen in Detroit Public Schools in fall 2002 and then in each subsequent year through June 2006.</p>
<p>They took into account the number who moved to charter schools or to other districts in the state, where records were available.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study found an even lower graduation rate for boys enrolled in Detroit Public Schools: just 25 percent, compared with 39 percent of girls &mdash; a discrepancy that mirrors national trends.</p>
<p>Jack Jennings, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Center on Education Policy, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, said large urban areas across the country have reported &#8220;shockingly low&#8221; graduation rates when calculated with the method used by MSU researchers. The counting method, called cohort, is required under No Child Left Behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you&rsquo;re seeing in Detroit is the same type of thing you&rsquo;re seeing in Chicago, (Los Angeles), Houston and all big cities,&#8221; Jennings said. &#8220;If the general finding is that the graduation rate in inner city schools isn&rsquo;t very high, they&rsquo;re correct &mdash; and it&rsquo;s something to be legitimately concerned about. It&rsquo;s a warning sign that maybe the situation is worse than we thought, and maybe we should do something about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This will be the first year we look at the number who enter as freshmen, and the number who graduate four years later,&#8221; Fritz said [Leslee Fritz, spokeswoman for the state Budget Office, Center for Educational Performance Initiatives]. &#8220;Certainly, we&rsquo;ve said that the expectation is that when you take that wider four-year view a number of districts will show a lower rate, and that the statewide graduation will go down as a result.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, MSU&rsquo;s Shakrani believes the data from his study is the most accurate to date for quantifying the scope of the dropout problem in Detroit and statewide.</p>
<p>Shakrani&rsquo;s study found that students are most likely to graduate once they start their senior year. Students have the highest likelihood of dropping out between ninth and 10th grade.</p>

			<p>All they need is just a little bit more tax-payer funding and I&rsquo;m sure these schools will take off.  Seriously, what a joke - 32%.  Inner-city high schools graduate kids who can&rsquo;t even read so what could possibly be so hard?  It&rsquo;s not like it really matters though - I don&rsquo;t think you need a high school degree to get a welfare check.</p>

			<p>In real estate, the three words are location, location, and location.  If you don&rsquo;t have a good location, you&rsquo;ll have a tough time selling your building.</p>
<p>In education, the three words are parents, parents, and parents.  If you don&rsquo;t have strong parental backing, you can do headstands and a kid won&rsquo;t learn.</p>
<p>Why is the graduation rate in Detroit abysmal?  </p>
<p>1)  80+% of students were born illegitimately.  <br>
2)  Only 31% of all adults are married.  <br>
3)  Over 400 people are murdered in that shrinking city every year.  <br>
4)  Finally, there are 2,000 registered sex offenders that claim Detroit as their place of residence.</p>
<p>Each of those four stats about social pathology goes back to the home.  If mom and dad are married, not in jail, not on substances, and are providing a caring, value-filled environment, children DO learn.</p>
<p>In Detroit it just plain isn&rsquo;t happening.  There&rsquo;s no magic wand that will make it happen.</p>
<p>Stay away.  Don&rsquo;t throw money at it.  And, don&rsquo;t vote for a presidential candidate who might be endorsed by any part of the corrupt, hip-hop Detroit political machine.</p>

			<p>Can any of you Amren readers guess why this rate is so low??? Come on now&hellip;think hard&hellip;is it because of Detroits deterioration to the pits in the last 30 years or so&hellip;because it is mostly black??? Nawwwwwwwww it can&rsquo;t be&hellip;.so much money is poured into black cities&hellip;and this is the results???? Hummm how odd.</p>

			<p>If I drove you by a Detroit high school today, I&rsquo;d bet you any amount of money you wouldn&rsquo;t get out of the car.  That is, if you&rsquo;re white.  </p>
<p>Detroit schools are well known as chaotic and dangerous. The weak and fearful are merely targets of opportunity for the huge predator class that wanders the hallways.  Teachers and administrators fear both these predators AND the parent who bore them. </p>
<p>This is a city that rewards failure at every turn and the young blacks know this.  They know that their toxic-tribal leaders will demand business and government hire more blacks due to the low numbers of their race in jobs.  The young ones know that the don&rsquo;t have to study, let alone learn something.  The doors will be open anyway because the government will bow to the demands of the wealthy black poverty pimps that soil our country.</p>
<p>About 10 or 15 years ago, Detroit had a teacher hiring drive and the local papers showed photos of a herd of young white hopefuls lined up to sign up.  The same papers reported only a month later that most had quit after facing classrooms full of black &#8220;students&#8221;.  Many of the white teachers hired on to teach elementary school as well, and they also quit saying the children were &#8220;too wild and undisciplined&#8221;.</p>
<p>Those that made it past a month eventually quit because after 8 weeks, the city still hadn&rsquo;t paid them.  The school administration told them that &#8220;these things take time&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Detroit schools have an average somewhere between 20 and 30 administrators PER SCHOOL!  Blacks hire assistants for their assistants for their assistants, and so on. Their practice of doing this borders on the hilarious, but they have no shame and feel that there is nothing wrong with an &#8220;assitant director of pool cleaning&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Detroit schools only exist for those who get a paycheck.  The &#8220;chirren&#8221; are but a mild afterthought.</p>
<p>A small &#8220;ps&#8221;, here. No Detroit school teacher&rsquo;s children go to their public schools.  This fact has been published ad nauseam almost every year. They send their kids to private schools.  The mayor, brutha Kwamee, voted against allowing the citizens to send their children to charter schools in order to gain favor of the school unions. Of course, he sends his offspring to&hellip;..charter schools.         </p>

			<p>blacks and hispanics learn early on a culture of lack of responsiblity for their actions agression and violence. children who are disruptive in classes should be give a warning and after four warnings get suspended and then finally moved to a special institution where they focus on teaching how to launder clothes, cook hamburgers, wash cars, aka the professions these people are likely to be able to handle, and arm the place to the teeth. but instead if a teacher tries any dicipline they get a law suit. so it will never change. we need to begin segregating our children by ablility AND by how diciplined they are starting at the 8th grade. </p>

			<p>Here is an excellent video of a Baltimore &#8220;in school suspension&#8221; class, which means that the students have been kicked out for the day and are supposed to be behaving themselves or face further discipline. Note the teacher sitting at his desk staring at a computer screen while the class riots. Detroit schools are probably identical.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;School officials &ldquo;convinced&rdquo; that more black students graduate than study says</p>
<p>Also, it must be realized, those Detroit Blacks that DO graduate   &mdash;   end up as rocket scientists, brain surgeons, or doing research in theoretical physics, quantum mechanics and other esoterica. Those other &#8220;graduates&#8221; ending up in the various prison systems were simply unfortunate enough to have been &#8216;railroaded&rsquo; by a prosececutor trying to make a name for himself, and by not having a high-priced, high profile attorney who would take their cases on a pro bono basis. (Their well-established guilt being a coincidence, of course.)</p>

<p>Thanks for the video.  Everyone should watch it for the human-biodiversity appreciation but make sure you turn your speaker down a little first.  Those &#8220;students&#8221; are ear-splittingly loud!!  I don&rsquo;t know how anyone can work around black &#8220;youths&#8221; without going deaf, and I really don&rsquo;t understand how the youfs themselves aren&rsquo;t all raspy and hoarse at the end of a long day&rsquo;s yelling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen similar situations to that video in malls, on the subway, on the streets, in <i><b>the library at college</b></i>&hellip;  I finally had to stop studying in my college library and computer labs once I realized that the bellowing blacks weren&rsquo;t going anywhere and the librarians weren&rsquo;t going to kick them out no matter how many times I complained.  In spite of many signs that said &#8220;QUIET! Silent Research Area&#8221;, the white librarians wouldn&rsquo;t dare confront blacks no matter how loudly they were cavorting with their friends or yelling into their cellphones.  </p>
<p>Why are they so loud??  I really don&rsquo;t understand it.  Don&rsquo;t they realize that they will never get the &#8220;respect&#8221; they are always going on about if their version of communication melts the eardrums of employers and authority figures?</p>
<p>Often in the college cafeteria I had to pick up my tray and move to the other side of the room to put some distance between screeching blacks and my poor ears.  You know it&rsquo;s bad when you go to school that is less than 10% black and you can&rsquo;t even eat a sandwich without ebonics screamed in your ears.  Having more than a handful of blacks on a college campus totally wrecks the academic atmosphere for the real students paying to learn, meanwhile the loudest blacks are never going to graduate anyway!  <br>

			<p>They don&rsquo;t have to graduate. They will get jobs instead of us. They will get into college anyway. They won&rsquo;t have to pay tuition in college. When they fail on the job they can cry racism and get away with it and continue on the payroll while we do their work.</p>

			<p>We are witnessing the de-industrialization of cities and nations. It is an amazing phenonema.  The clearist example is Rhodesia deindustrializing and decivilizing into Zimbabwe. South Africa is undergoing this trend. Hopefully they will change the name too since it is no longer a whtie nation. They need to give it an African name to better suit its new African state of being.</p>
<p>Go to:           www.deathofjohannesburg.blogspot.com/</p>
<p>There are many websites that show the destruction of South Africa since the whites are leaving, and thus the civilization.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem, for Detroit, is to require that ALL city, county and state employees in the busing/driving vicinity MUST send their school-aged children to Detroit Public Schools. IT must be a mangatory part of the job. If you want to work off the state, you must send your children to state schools.</p>
<p>That will be a blast to see.</p>

			<p>The fundamental problem is socialism, and public education is a socialist idea. For reasons beyond my comprehension, public school attendance is mandatory. Public schools must accept everyone, including the unmotivated and the ineducable. Blacks, with their a median IQ of 85, fall disproportionately into those categories. Regardless of any further government intervention or any spontaneous social reform, black graduation rates seem unlikely ever to exceed fifty per cent.</p>
<p>If we could somehow abolish socialism and require families to educate their children at their own expense, we could achieve results at least as good at much lower cost. Actually, within a generation or two, we&rsquo;d have a much better society, the criminal and feeble-minded having been winnowed out. Of course, this better society would be about ninety per cent white. Such a lack of diversity would be completely unacceptable to our rulers.</p>

			<p>&#8220;School officials &ldquo;convinced&rdquo; that more black students graduate than study says.&#8221;</p>
<p>This could be true. I met a school teacher who claimed the school she worked at kept the names of students who weren&rsquo;t attending still on the books. The school got funded by the number of students. These were white teachers (the other teacher present just listened and made no comment) at an &#8216;inner-city&rsquo; school. So, taking away phantom-students, the graduation rate could be as high as 50 %. </p>
<p>Wonder where the black youths who attend these schools learn to lie so well? At home, among friends? or at school?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Not a WORD, not a SINGLE WORD in the article about the race of the students!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now does anyone in America really not know what inner city Detroit looks like?  If it were an Article about Provo Utah, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d need ID either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;all that will matter is how well Whites and blacks learn to fire a rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately we may be firing them at US troops.</p>

<p> Your post is bang on. There is an old Chinese saying; &#8220;a wise person knows much but says little, a fool knows little but says much&#8221;. Apparently very loudly too.</p>

			<p>Jill&rsquo;s posting is so true.  Blacks are just too loud!  It ruins decor and the learning experience.  This social pathology is what separates them from all races under the sun.  I always am amazed at the longanimity and forebearance of those who are in charge or those ethnic groups who show a quieter disposition.  What must they be thinking about the uncivilized cacaphony of Blacks?  </p>

			<p>Detroit is no different from any other city in the world in that it is the family or lack thereof which drives the focus on education and higher learning.  Money will never solve the problem.  The only advantage Detroit has at this point is that it is almost empty just waiting to be refilled with people looking to make an investment in the future.</p>
