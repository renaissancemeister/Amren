						<p>ST. JOHN&rsquo;S &mdash; An Iranian man studying in Newfoundland has been sentenced to three months in jail for kissing a woman on her breast while the two were sharing an elevator.</p>
<p>Farhood Azarsina, 25, pleaded guilty last week to sexual assault.</p>
<p>Mr. Azarsina, a PhD student in engineering at Memorial University, admitted kissing the top of the woman&rsquo;s breast while the two were on an elevator at the St. John&rsquo;s school on Sept. 27.</p>
<p>He apologized in court last week, explaining he acted on impulse.</p>
<p>Judge David Orr said during sentencing Wednesday that Mr. Azarsina &#8220;has a superficial understanding of the effect of his actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sentenced the student to two months in jail but gave him double credit for the three weeks he&rsquo;s already served, leaving him with 18 days left to serve.</p>
<p>Judge Orr said the fact the assault took place in an elevator, an enclosed space, added to the trauma.</p>
<p>Mr. Azarsina said he didn&rsquo;t realize the seriousness of the offence in this country.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&rsquo;t expect all males to control themselves when the breasts are out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old woman, in a victim-impact statement read in court last week, described the negative effect the incident has had on her life.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be a day I should remember. Instead, it was a day I&rsquo;ll never forget,&#8221; she said, adding it has turned her into a fearful person who is unable to sleep or concentrate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m struggling to retain some kind of normalcy in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Azarsina told the court last week that he has also suffered. He said he was verbally and physically harassed by other prisoners during his time in jail.</p>
<p>&#8220;They called me &lsquo;camel-back rider&rsquo; and &lsquo;Osama bin Laden,&rsquo; said Mr. Azarsina, who claimed he was assaulted twice.</p>

			<p>It seems that Persians (and Indians too) seem far more likely to be sexual deviants - in proportion to their U.S. population percentages?</p>
<p>(Is it just me   &mdash;  - or are there a unusually large number of Persian and Indian men showing up on those &#8220;To catch a predator&#8221; shows on MSNBC?)</p>

			<p>It is well known that the people of the Middle East have low impulse control. I am more and more beginning to think that the very draconian laws of Islam are suited to these people and perhaps even necessary to keep them in check. Certain races seem to need much stricter policing in order to keep their genetic urges under control.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s multiculturalism for you - men bringing all their misogynistic beliefs and practices over to Canada and other western, civilized nations. So Mr. Azarsina feels that because a woman&rsquo;s not draped in a chador or burka, he is entitled to do whatever he wants to her because he can&rsquo;t control his impulses? I wonder how this Iranian dude would react if a gay man started groping him, explaining that as Mr. Azarsina&rsquo;s body and face were not fully cloaked, the gay guy simply couldn&rsquo;t control himself. No doubt Mr. Azarsina would be furious, claiming that such an assualt was on account of the West&rsquo;s moral descent. Oh, wait, he&rsquo;s already using that excuse to justify groping an innocent woman, isn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>On another note, I&rsquo;m not impressed by the female &#8216;victim&rsquo; who claims she can no longer sleep or concentrate. Get over it, lady! Yeah, it was a disgusting incident, but buck up and move on. Next time that happens, punch the groper as hard as you can! Isn&rsquo;t feminism supposed to empower women? Well, I guess as long as feminism keeps saying that men are responsible for all of women&rsquo;s problems, it&rsquo;s no wonder that some women are reluctant to take responsibility for dealing with what life throws at them.<br>

<p>Those who call you names and assault you, they too are acting on impulse.  Please try to understand that the people who call you names and assault you are victims too.</p>

			<p>I think the proper punishment would be to send him back to Iran.  Banning him from the campus/three months in jail seems too light.  You should see what kind of punishment that East Asian men/white men get for things much softer than what he has done to the woman.  Likely the liberal authorities decided to give him such a light punishment.  I was going to say I do see a step in the right direction, which was banning him from the campus, but I guess it was made by money-desperate management of the school&hellip; if that man comes back to the campus, all female students will refuse to come to school</p>
<p>&#8220;He said he was verbally and physically harassed by other prisoners during his time in jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>but he does not feel a tiny bit sorry about what he has done to the woman?  </p>

			<p>In an Interpersonal Communication class in college, we were to test &#8216;uncomfortable interpersonal behavior&rsquo; practices around campus. Another student and I entered an elevator and did not turn to face the doors when they closed. The other passengers were uncomfortable. We didn&rsquo;t have to make eye contact, speak a word, or touch anyone. (We let them know, rather quickly, what we were doing.)</p>
<p>Who will he blame his lack of control on? (the whites, I guess)</p>
<p>He is suppossed to suffer in prison. Holdidng a person against their will, to protect the public, was a universally accepted reason for imprisonment, at one time.</p>
<p>The girl is 20. She needs to toughen up for her own good.<br>

			<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect all males to control themselves when the breasts are out,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><br>
Unfortunately, he is right.  He should have been given a 20 year prison sentence simply to reinforce the fact that yes&hellip;.we do demand that all men control themselves&hellip;..or else, in this country.</p>
<p>The fact that he only got 18 days, means that isn&rsquo;t true.  Criminals from other countries can do as they please here.</p>

			<p>Absolutely silly for this poor girl to be so upset that she cannot sleep. I would have slapped this dude until his ears rang and threw him off the elevator. My grandmother taught me to defend myself if I am touched or molested. Persians have very poor impulse control and cannot help themselves around European women, the poor girls I have known who were married to these low lives were abused daily and subjected to horrific sexual abuse.</p>

EA, how many Christians, I`m sorry, let me rephrase that, &#8220;how many WHITE Christians have committed rape/assault and battery against  women in general?</p>

<p>1) Newfoundland is one part of Canada that is still as homogeneous as all of Canada was until the late 1960&rsquo;s. I hope the &#8220;Newfies&#8221; in the pen do a real number on this guy.</p>
<p>2) Typical muslim mentality. No burka = whore.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t, not at all. I wouldn&rsquo;t put it one bit past him to &#8220;graduate&#8221; to rape. While westerners who go abroad are amonished to respect the local culture and learn it and abide by it, he doesn&rsquo;t. He should be kicked out of their country. Who needs him and his ilk. What do you think would happen to a white man who behaved like that in a muslim country? If he didn&rsquo;t get lynched or stoned, he would be kicked out pronto.  We don&rsquo;t need these &#8220;people&#8221; in our countries and white men need to stand strong against this instead of saying it&rsquo;s no big deal because they disrespect you just as much as thay are the woman.</p>

			<p>This behaviour of forcing themselves onto Western woman among Iranians and Pakistanis is not unusual from my observations in school. I&rsquo;ve had close contact with several of each, ranging in various fields of study up to PhD level, to make such a generalization. I&rsquo;ve not had sufficient contact with other southwest Asian to north Africans, during and after student life, to make generalization about the entire region but would imagine it to be the case as well.</p>
<p>They seem to be under the arrogant impression that their mere presence is sufficient to illicit passion from woman. In a case with a Pakistani, trying to kiss a pretty female in the residence laundry room as if she would fall madly in love with him simply by being alone in the room together. This was reported to her peers but not to authorities which goes to show that all such incidents make news. Note that in traditional Muslim practices, it is not permitted for females to be outside except in the company of a spouse or related male. Another memorable character, among many others, is an undergrad Iranian engineering student, about 35 years old at the time, who said such things as I like French cars because I love French women, I like [women with] light skin, I love the smell of (vagina!, explicative). Though middle aged and in a technical field, he displayed lack of impulse control particularly associated with expressing sexual feelings. He let out exactly what was on his mind, more so than Africans I have observed. Oh, and he was said to be a hash dealer.</p>
<p>My personal experiences are reinforced by this article. The article is not reporting just an isolated incident in a remote part of Canada.</p>

<p>ANSWER: Statistically almost never. <br>
In proportion to population black males exhibit the highest rate of committing rape of any other race BY FAR.<br>
Whites MUCH less.<br>
Far East Asians, least of all.</p>
<p>Personally, I like Persians (as long as they reject Islamic extremism). They are not a problem, as far as predatory or pathological behavior. Nor are Asian Indians. Nor are Arabs in general. Nor are Far East Asians of course. Nor are Hispanics. <br>
There is only ONE problem group (in general). ALL of us are victims of black pathologies and criminal racist predation. (Let&rsquo;s call it what it is: BLACK OPPRESSION.) We must NEVER loose sight of that. Some isolated case of a Persian kissing some gal&rsquo;s breast in the elevator is not really my top concern right now. No. Just to put things in the proper perspective, THIS illustrates what the problem is. (And I am speaking in a statistical sense of course.) And it is raging across the country and has for nearly half a century now. It is part of DAILY LIFE. This recent incident perfectly illustrates what is REALLY going on:</p>
<p>Just last month, in Lake Wales FL, near Orlando, a black male by the name of Leon Davis kidnapped two Hispanic females at random, Juanita Luciano and Ivonne Bustamante (several months pregnant), locked them in a room, doused them down with a flammable liquid AND BURNED THEM ALIVE!!! This black male, Leon Davis, has been responsible for a LONG STRING of attacks and robberies upon Hispanics in the area. A week earlier he murdered two Asian Indian Hindus in Lake Alfred FL.</p>
<p>Notice how the national media has, once again, COMPLETELY CENSORED THESE UNSPEAKABLY HORRIFIC BLACK ON NON-BLACK RACIAL ATROCITIES! (The same media that was all over the Duke Lacrosse farce whipping up racial hysteria, until the fact it was an obvious hoax could no longer be denied.) There is no end to it.</p>

			<p>To the person who asked the question about how many white Christians raped or molested women&hellip; Muslim men can grab, grope, rape and molest any woman not wearing a hijab/burkah. This is guaranteed by their religion. Christian men who rape or molest do this in violation of Christianity. This is the difference.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
Actually, I think so too.   Not do defend his behaviour, but this overdone punishment is rather hysterical. Did he leave any broken bones or bruise marks?  Was she bleeding heavily?<br>
Poor thing, she may never get over this life-shattering experience! A fate worse than death.</p>
<p>Yes, Canadians are a bit wacko. This is another example of Political correctness running rampant in the service of feminism. Probably he just thought he was being gallant. Latins and such are like that. If the Canadians hadn&rsquo;t been taught by the feminists that all men are monsters, the sentence would have been a fraction of that.</p>
<p>As for those prisoners who abused him in jail, I&rsquo;ll bet they were in for a lot of worse things.</p>

<p>Posted by at 9:43 PM on February 1 </p>
<p>I am sorry; I must have misphrased what I was saying. I was referring to a stereotype, not a personal belief. I know muslims are not better behaved; I was pointing out a contradiction in the &#8216;PC&rsquo; Media&rsquo;s arguement that muslims are &#8220;better&#8221; than Christians (especially Whites). I am a White Christian, and have noticed the media trying to paint Abdul (the muslim) as a better European (-American) citizen than Joe (a White Christian), regardless of the situation. I have observed/heard about some Arabs, and read about them in history. And many (though not all; I am not stereotyping all Arabs/muslims) are just as degenerate as many Black Africans are perceived to be. They had (at least) their fair share of rapes, and slave trading of European women, throughout relatively recent history. I actually know a probable part-Turk, who was as &#8220;sexed&#8221; as the Blacks and Hispanics (with one Hispanic exception; he was part Black), at my school. </p>
<p>I am not trying to paint a universal picture of everybody; however, to be perfectly honest, Arabs do have the genetic design to be generally more sexually-oriented than Whites (Europeans, Jews, and White Semites) and Asians. It&rsquo;s because of their warmer climate, among other conditions. They, Blacks, and Hispanics are generally more &#8220;open,&#8221; emotional than we are. They generally feel more open about their sexual bodies, and some may sometimes place emotion over reason. This is one reason why, I want kids like me. I am more reserved (in public) for even a European, and love the ideal of reason (although I realize even it has limits, especially with belief/faith). I am disgusted by the idea of pure emotion &#8216;ruling our political system.&rsquo; (Most women off of Amren are more emotionally driven than males are. (This is why so many of them are less likely to agree with us, on racial displacement. I have a very very smart mother, who is very rationally minded. However has mixed feelings about illegal immigration, only because a feminized White male co-worker keeps calling her &#8220;racist,&#8221; just because she believes in enforcing our immigration laws, otherwise (if he didn&rsquo;t race-baither.). He is a &#8220;sick&#8221; &#8220;Anti-racist,&#8221; married to a Hispanic woman, who hates his own kind. We tend to think more with reason.) </p>
<p>And why should I want my genes mixed with the less &#8220;reserved,&#8221; and more &#8220;open,&#8221; (sometimes purely, for some) emotionally minded races? Darker races tend to be more emotional and &#8220;un&#8221;-shy about their feelings (and frequently sexuality, for some individuals). </p>
<p>Anyways, with the genetic encoding, some male muslims (though far from all), in the West, have broken major tenets of Islam. They can marry multiple women, and abuse them. They can also marry and divorce (if I am correct), so they technically could just rotate &#8220;one night stands?&#8221; And yet many are still partaking in pre-martial sexual intercourse with white female Christians. Many are probably drinking; and many would probably eat pork (on a regular basis), if they knew how great it tasted! </p>
<p>I concede Whites (even Christians) have their hypocrites, but the media is ignoring the hypocrisy of Islam in the West. At least our social degenerates are honest. </p>
<p>All in all, the best thing for Islam, is to actually leave Europe and probably the rest of the West, before it gets corupted. The whole irony is that Islam could die, by invading Europe, instead of expanding (with hopes of World domination). It&rsquo;s also ironic that Islam would be guaranteed survival, if it just stays in the Middle East, Northern Africa, and Southeastern Asia. <br>

Although the act committed by the Iranian is unacceptable to all well-mannered people, there was atime not so long ago when it would have been laughed off as &#8216;Benny Hill style prank&rsquo; committed by a &#8216;raincoater&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>&#8220;(Most women off of Amren are more emotionally driven than males are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not true. It&rsquo;s men that are responsible largely, though not completely, for this mass immigration as well as losing control and committing violent acts such as shooting rampages. Women are actually more in control of their emotions and less likely to act out then men. Anyway, your mother&rsquo;s male co-worker who believes criticizing latino immigration is racist isn&rsquo;t &#8220;feminized&#8221;, he&rsquo;s marxist. Anyway, many on here are missing the point. What he did in the elevator may not be as bad as a lot of things but it says something about his views as a muslim and the fact that he feels he did no wrong. He and others like him are NOT compatable with our societies and whites, both men and women should not sit back and shrug that it&rsquo;s no big deal. He and other muslims don&rsquo;t respect you as men if you dismiss such things. Muslims need to go.</p>

<p>It was ONLT a kiss, for god&rsquo;s sake! I hope people here can see that the hysterical response to this incident is the direct result of anti-male feminist teaching running wild for the past several generations.<br>
It&rsquo;s the &#8220;men are evil&#8221; doctrine in practice. No, he shouldn&rsquo;t have done it, but let&rsquo;s keep things in perspective. He didn&rsquo;t harm her. And no, I don&rsquo;t think a kiss will lead to rape nexttime.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t President Mushareff of Pakistan say he was going to seduce Condi Rice to sway her to the Pakistani point of view in some diplomatic meeting?</p>
<p>Imagine, that very good looking woman, US Secretary of State, succumbing to the lechery of Mushareef, President of one of the most failed and corrupt states in the world who looks like a frog with a mustache!!!!!!</p>

<p>Touching breasts, thighs, buttucks and between the legs is considered sexual assault, a considerably more serious charge than if he had hit her in the face which would be simple assault and battery.</p>

			<p>There is usually a good reason for customs and manners, no matter how strange they might seem.  Cannabalism for the Aztecs and many Africans was simply a simple way to get protein in the diet.</p>
<p>The islamic confining of women to the home, not letting them out without a male chaperone or body guard, total body and head covering, there is a good reason for all this: Islamic men cannot control themselves.  That&rsquo;s why they explode in riots.  That is why they are so prone to groping and rape.</p>
<p>A friend&rsquo;s Grandmother, who grew up in Cuba in the 1950&rsquo;s told me that Cuban women carried a special basket, a grocery basket to avoid unwanted approaches.  The grocery basket meant that the woman was a respectable housewife or maid out doing the family food shopping.  And women who didn&rsquo;t carry the distinctive grocery basket were harassed both verbally and physically.</p>

			<p>Some comments here refer to an alleged lack of impulse control&hellip; </p>
<p>This is an engineering student working towards a PhD.  Very likely he is highly intelligent and able to control himself and use forethought in *most* situations.</p>
<p>He likely kissed the woman&rsquo;s breast in the elevator because he lacks social skills and probably struggled with women.  He sounds like a nerd who was sexually frustrated.  That&rsquo;s really all there is to this story.</p>

If he is a foreigner why was he not deported?  It may not have been a felony but why would the judge endanger local women by letting the man stay.  Next time this &#8220;person&#8221; will probably just knock the woman out, have his way and then who knows.  <br>

			<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of impulse control, Five women were shot and killed in a Lane Bryant store in suburban Chicago.  The police describe it as a &#8220;botched robbery&#8221; attempt. There is a link below from a British newspaper. It is the only article that I could find that describes the race of the man as Black.<br>
 Most criminals would simply flee if the attempt went bad, not ramp up the crime to multiple murder. <br>
The area is described as being predominantly White. I would wager that all the victims were White as well. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that this is true. There was a chilling article in a back issue of American Renaissance about the widespread practice of sexual assault in prisons. Gang rape, intimidation, buying trading and selling of sex slaves, and other perversions, usually race-related, are quite common. This Mr. Azarsina is lucky he didn&rsquo;t go into one of the larger prison systems.</p>

			<p>Any man who allows his teenage daughter to go to work at a jobsite where Hispanics, Blacks or Middle Eastern males predominate needs to have his head examined. This is just a set up for a poor girl to be grabbed, groped and possibly assaulted. The same would go for a workplace where females of the aforementioned groups predominate, as soon as the boyfriends/husbands notice the White girl she is likely to be the victim of a physical assault. </p>

<p>Under your theory, no breast would be safe at M.I.T. and all elevators at engineering schools would need security guards.  Tokyo would be the sexual assault capital of the world.  In the USA, White and Asian math majors would be locked up in numbers exceeding inner-city black males!  </p>

			<p>While I agree with all these posts criticizing the lack of self control of many if not most non-Western, non-White men, I have to also think of the level of hypocracy involved in the bait we are so used to ignoring in the West.  Everywhere a man turns his head there is a set of those and that, a photo of one, a tv commerical with them, etc.  All our media is full of it and racing to produce more.  Most newscasters are now beautiful young women with pert little smirks - they know exactly what they are doing.</p>
<p>Men in the West are raised on the culture of Ulysses.  From the torments of the Vestal Virgins to the latest pop-tart news, the Western male is psycho-sexually tormented daily.  No wonder a few white men go off the rails, let alone the others we know about all too well.  I am not surprised that men from unconditioned cultures just can&rsquo;t handle it.  That is no excuse for them, but I do think that Western women are often far out of the realm of decent behavior but we are trained to accept the bizarre as normal.  And it seems to get worse all the time.  Now children can see ads for &#8220;erectile disfunction&#8221; on prime time television.  Ahhh,&hellip; civilization!<br>

I must say this, though; as a father of a teenage daughter, I am very aware that a young lady should use some discretion when going out in public. You cannot deny that there are sexual predators and perverts everywhere. I would suggest that a woman who is spilling forth her breasts, which she has the right to do, may be putting herself at risk for trouble. As I have said many times - IF YOU DON&#8221;T MAKE TROUBLE, THERE WILL NOT BE TROUBLE!</p>

<p>Or would correlating crimes by third-world immigrants to White victims be considered &#8220;hateful&#8221;, &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;mean-spirited?&#8221;</p>

I do suspect that prisoners in a setting like this look for someone else to abuse and to look down upon, someone who - in their own opinion - is even lower on the pecking scale than they are.  People are always looking for someone else to step on   &mdash;    especially the lower down the social ladder you go.  They must have rejoiced in knowing  that he was a PhD engineering student, whereas most of them probably didn&rsquo;t even make  it out of grammar school.   I&rsquo;m sure he made their day.</p>

I was thinking the same thing. There aren&rsquo;t many places (outside of Montana or Vermont) where you can be picky.</p>
<p>But I must add that I have seen the same revolting behavior among white males, who have obviously been raised in the minority-worshipping,  anything-goes culture that has held us in its grip for the past four decades.  They&rsquo;re acting out what they&rsquo;ve seen portrayed on TV, movies, and in  (so-called) &#8220;adult&#8221; magazines.  Their tasteless, immature behavior would never have been considered acceptable in another era when there were strict and clear standards.  Before that, we didn&rsquo;t need judges and EEOC because we had manners instead,  And if they didn&rsquo;t work, social pressure did. These kept people in line.  We had a very clear idea what was acceptable and what was not.  Now, hardly anyone really knows.</p>

<p>If you look a bit closer, you can see exactly what&rsquo;s acceptable and what&rsquo;s not. There&rsquo;s not much mystery. Anything women and blacks do is acceptable. Anything white men do is a barely bearable toleration. <br>
