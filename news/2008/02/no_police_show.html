						<p>New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin and Police Superintendent Warren Riley on Tuesday used the floor of the Superdome to display more than $1 million in new armament and other equipment, largely for use by the SWAT squad in emergency and riot situations, including a fully equipped mobile command post, two armored cars and modern assault rifles.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the equipment was financed from a $6.6 million state allocation to New Orleans police that was earmarked for crime-fighting items or strategies, Riley said.</p>
<p>The city officials said the new equipment reflected a determination by the Police Department to root out and arrest criminals and make New Orleans safer, as well as to help police handle any emergency situation encountered.</p>
<p>The money will also pay for 600 bullet-proof vests.</p>
<p>The 27- and 14-ton armored cars, costing about $380,000 and $270,000 respectively, will provide cover to officers in SWAT situations and help them safely evacuate citizens from dangerous situations, Riley said.</p>
<p>The vehicles, Lenco Bear and BearCat models, will also enable SWAT officers and negotiators to get closer to barricaded suspects.</p>

					<p>The problem with <span class="caps">N.O. </span>is not the lack of funds or equipment, it is the people using these funds and equipment. As we saw with Hurricane Katrina, the resources were there, the population just lacked the motivation or intelligence to use them properly (think of all the ill-used resources that have been pumped into the African continent). Just look at that picture. The fact these people are better armed should not make you feel safer, it should make you uneasy.</p>

					<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to say.  In nearly every state, Nagin could be criminally charged for pointing the gun at Riley like that, and a member of our armed forces could be courtmartialed for being a whole lot less careless than the mayor.</p>

					<p>Wow!  A &#8220;chocolate city&#8221; sure is expensive, isn&rsquo;t it?  About that photo, you&rsquo;d think the mayor would know you&rsquo;re not supposed to point a firearm at another person unless you intend to shoot him. Even if they know, for a fact, that the rifle isn&rsquo;t loaded, what kind of message does publishing a photo like that send (other than he&rsquo;s an idiot, I mean)?</p>

					<p>Diversity&rsquo;s good for business. In this case, it&rsquo;s good for $6.6 million in contracts for armored cars, bulletproof vests, assault rifles and a &#8220;fully equipped mobile command post,&#8221; but I doubt if this is going to be enough to solve the crime problem in New Orleans. There&rsquo;s only one piece of military hardware that will do the trick and that&rsquo;s a neutron bomb.</p>

					<p>Apparently the &#8220;mayor,&#8221; having been frustrated in his attempt to steal White peoples&rsquo; guns, simply decided to steal taxpayer money to buy his own.  Where, O where, are the shrill voices of the &#8220;gun control&#8221; crowd now?  Oh, that&rsquo;s right   &mdash;   &#8220;gun control&#8221; only applies to law-abiding Whites.</p>

<p>And these units are to be deployed after the next, and biggest, false flag operation.  My guess is it will be nuclear.  What will follow is marshall law, disarmament of the American people and invasions of Iran, Syria, North Korea and wherever else the Dark Forces behind the regime want to go to consolidate their New World Order.</p>

<p>Seriously, friend: What <span class="caps">WOULD </span>you expect from a Black mayor, Black city administration and mainly Black police force? You might recall these same, fine, &#8220;honest&#8221; police officers were &#8220;forced&#8221; a few days after Katrina to steal (sorry, I meant to say, <span class="caps">BORROW</span>) some 28 Cadillacs   &mdash;   for patrolling those water-logged, debris strewn streets. (Probably also to assist in the looting, since looters, I meant honest citizens and police forces foraging for food, water, electronics, sporting goods and designer clothes   &mdash;   would probably feel more comfortable loading the stolen loot into something <span class="caps">NOT </span>resembling a police cruiser.</p>
<p>As to our poster commenting &#8220;This country isn&rsquo;t supposed to have an <span class="caps">SS.</span>&#8221; let me say that after years of scoffing, I am starting to believe the idea of a New World Order controlling our Village Idiot, George W. Bush playing at being President of this country. But then we are also told by His Idiocy, the 911 Events were the work of Muslim Extremists and never mind the thousands of contradictions and unanswered questions in the Official Version of 911. Like, for just one example, how a few clowns could take over the controls of four airlines, given these same people could barely properly control a simple trainer aircraft. Then with unerring precision, after flying hundreds of miles, having turned those planes, manage to hit slender targets like those twin towers   &mdash;   on the first pass. Dead center, in spite of the morning turbulence at low altitudes. Say, if any of <span class="caps">YOU READERS </span>truly believe the government version of the 911 Events, please contact me   &mdash;   I have one fantastic deal to offer you on the Brooklyn Bridge. And all you need to do after you buy it   &mdash;   is sit back and collect the toll receipts.</p>

					<p>These two look like they are playing Scarface and having a grand old time.  At least they kept the magazines out of the guns and their fingers off the triggers for the picture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet than more than 30% of the NO police force will defect if they ever have a real need to use those guns and armor.  That is, more than disarming untrained and undisciplined civilians.</p>
<p>I wonder if we will be hearing about a future NO massacre involving crooked cops, drug cartels and innocent people caught in the crossfire.  <br>

<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget the California Highway Patrol officers that were brought in to illegally confiscate guns from New Orleans residents. When that happened, my wife asked me why would <span class="caps">CHP </span>officers be brought in to work in New Orleans. I told her that it was to confiscate guns, since the local cops might not want to do it by reason of actually knowing the people they&rsquo;d be robbing. (Not to mention the fact that the average person doesn&rsquo;t have the resources to drive to California, find the officer that stole his gun, and engage in a little payback.)</p>
<p>Her jaw hit the floor with an alomost audible thud when the 10:00 news showed <i>exactly that</i> as the lead story, about 20 minutes after we&rsquo;d had our discussion. And another convert was made&hellip;</p>

					<p>Fed Up<br>
Have you looked at the absenteeism of the Twin Towers and the ludicrously under-booked flights on 9/11?  The London bomings were also a false flag, the whole episode full of unanswered questions and a media which remains silent.  I&rsquo;m sure the guy the police executed two days later was an unwitting bomber who had opened his rucksack and then went on the run. Eye witnesses say he knew his killers.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t off topic either because it ties in with immigration and the New World Order.  Every western country has been flooded with immigrants and the politicians shrug and say they can&rsquo;t control the prob.  The stated aims of Bilderberg are a world without borders, no sovereignty, no nationalities, no races, one government.  Immigration destroys homogeneity making the population easier to rob of their sovereignty.  The war on terror is about inciting fear so they can take away our rights.</p>
<p>Racial and religious tensions will be met with a more and more militarised police (see weapons above). Didn&rsquo;t Kissinger say that one day the American people would welcome the arrival of United Nations troops to sort out domestic problems?  And speaking of the Prince Of Darkness, he also said we needed just one big &#8216;disaster&rsquo; to bring the world together.</p>
<p>I ask people to try out this experiment: blog the <span class="caps">MSM </span>accusing Bilderberg and see if they publish your post.  <br>

<p>What&rsquo;s really bizarre &mdash; and frightening &mdash; is why did <span class="caps">NORAD </span>stand down?</p>
<p>Posted by at 7:09 PM on February 14</p>
<p>Actually, Colleen Rowley told an audience at a local Unitarian Church that all branches of the military were scheduled to do an exercise that day that closely mirrors the events that unfolded. This is where the confusion stemmed from and why it took so long to scramble jets. (Our) entire military was on Stand Down Orders due to these exercises, which had to have been planned months in advance.</p>
<p>I thought for sure there would be nothing earth-shattering at that talk and I was so wrong. I can see why people just want to keep their heads in the sand after learning things of this sort.</p>
<p>As for these two in the story &hellip; what more is there to say &hellip;</p>

					<p>&#8220;I wonder how common negligent firearms discharge injuries are on the <span class="caps">NOPD.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>The funniest &#8220;negligent firearms discharge&#8221; by a copper was one where a cop took out his Glock and decided to hang it on the coat hanger rack on the back of the toilet door. After he ADed a round the gun turned into a pinwheel repeatedly discharging as it went round-and-round&hellip;</p>

					<p>You got the chief of police and the mayor holding these dangerous assault rifles (one being pointed at the other guy, violating the first rule of gun ownership) and their both smiling like kids in a play-yard. What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?</p>

					<p>Anyone else think this will be used for more unconstitutional house-to-house raids, Katrina-style?</p>

<i>Say, if any of <span class="caps">YOU READERS </span>truly believe the government version of the 911 Events, please contact me  &mdash;  I have one fantastic deal to offer you on the Brooklyn Bridge. And all you need to do after you buy it  &mdash;  is sit back and collect the toll receipts.</i></p>
<p>The above post is off topic and really adds nothing to the current discussion. I have no problem believing that many Arabs hate Western Civilization strongly enough to plan and carry out the attacks  &mdash;  far more than I believe that thousands of people could keep a perfect secret (which would be necessary depending on what version of the conspiracy theory you believe). In fact, I think I see <span class="caps">YOU </span>buying that bridge.</p>
