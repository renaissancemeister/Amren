						<p>Overwhelming public opposition to plans for an Afrocentric alternative school will not deter the Toronto District School Board from pressing ahead with the project, according to board chair John Campbell.</p>
<p>An Angus Reid poll released Saturday reported 79 per cent of respondents across Ontario oppose creating the school, and 59 per cent are strongly opposed. Of the 15 per cent in favour of the school, only 3 per cent offered strong support. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty&rsquo;s decision not to provide the board with extra funding for the school also proved popular with 82 per cent of respondents.</p>
<p>But Mr. Campbell said the board will not be swayed by public opinion, though he acknowledged it is sensitive to criticism from Mr. McGuinty and Education Minister Kathleen Wynne.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell also said the board understands the public&rsquo;s many concerns, especially as nine of 20 trustees voted against the school. But he thinks most of the wider criticism arises from a lack of understanding of the proposal&rsquo;s goals and methods.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what trustees did was respond to a request from a community to set up an alternative school, and perhaps those responding to the poll don&rsquo;t have a complete appreciation of just what this school will be about,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People read headlines and they respond to headlines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trustee Josh Matlow said he thinks opposition arises not out of ignorance of the issues, but rather from a philosophical difference akin to Mr. McGuinty&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people generally understand what this is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They understand that there are some people with good intentions who want this school for all the right reasons, but [those objecting to the school] hold a principled position that dividing kids by the colour of their skin, even for the best of intentions, is not the way to arrive at a just society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opposition is even greater in the GTA, though the regional numbers have a higher margin of error. In the 905 area, support for the school sits at just 11 per cent, compared with 85 per cent against it.</p>
<p>Across Ontario, equally lopsided numbers of people said they see the plan as a form of segregation and would oppose any ethnically focused school.</p>

			<p>Just goes to show that democracy inevitably crumbles when up against multiculturalism. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if the vast majority of the citizenry oppose black schools, the Toronto District School Board will still push ahead, out of a desire to be &#8216;accommodating&rsquo;. On another note, didn&rsquo;t blacks originally push for the right to attend white schools? So why do they want to turn back the clock? Is it because they can&rsquo;t compete?</p>

Both these policies will inexorably lead, and are presently leading before our very eyes, to loss of freedoms of expression and association, disenfranchisement, and the gradual establishment of totalitarian surveillance and control of Western native peoples.</p></p>

			<p><i>&#8220;But Mr. Campbell said the board will not be swayed by public opinion&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Perhaps he should pay more attention to &#8220;public opinion&#8221; because kings in the past, much to their peril, have lost their imperial heads for ignoring the wishes of the public.</p>

<p>This wrong-headed decision only serves as a band-aid solution to a festering problem that won&rsquo;t heal. To get themselves off the hook, some school trustees have thrown a bone to a scowling dog that will demand to be fed sirloin steaks in the near future.</p>
<p>Eighty-Five percent of tax-paying respondents have given a <i>thumbs&rsquo; down</i> to this decision, sending a clear signal to the tail&hellip;.it does not wag the dog.</p>

			<p>White marxists at their most insidious.  Force the population into government indoctrination, force them to pay for it, and train resident aliens to despise the people and culture that was forced to take them in.</p>
<p>And it isn&rsquo;t as if afro-centrism is even really about real african history and culture, (and I use those terms loosely in this case).  It is nothing but a farrago of lies so fantastic one would have to have an IQ under 75 to give them any credence at all.  Oh, wait a minute, now I get it.</p>

			<p>Personally I do not mind this concept.  If they really want to spend time with non-African people of their age, they have all their chances outside the school.  And even in ordinary schools most African kids mostly associate with African students.  </p>
<p>If they decide to build a pure Korean school, I would still do not mind.  I am very neutral.  Most Korean kids around me would be very neutral as well.  Actually there already is a virtual Korean school&hellip; the classes take place on Saturdays.  </p>
<p>ah just in case you are wondering, the &#8220;Korean Puppy&#8221; is my nickname.  I heard that I have the eyes of a puppy.  </p>

			<p>This self segregation by African students in the school system might be a blessing in disguise for European-descended students in Toronto. Who cares what they teach. Whatever drivel they spoon feed their students will be worthless for non-pc serious post secondary studies anyway. The advantage for European-descended pupils will be: less violence, less drugs, less group intimidation, and less dumbing down of the curriculum. In theory, the more African students this school attacts will mean less afro-centric pathologies for White students.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m ALL for this school.  In fact, these schools should become mandated throughout Western civilization.  In the U.S., Brown vs Board of Education was originally decided based on the fact that segregated schools were unequal.  Not so anymore.  <br>
Throughout the U.S., schools with so-called &#8220;majority-minority&#8221; student populations are routinely funded at higher levels that majority white schools, yet &#8220;white schools&#8221; beat the pants off of their over-funded minority schools.<br>
In minority school districts, corruption at the highest levels has become the norm.  Statistics show that many of these schools receive more funding per pupil than their white counterparts, yet we still hear cries about how minority students must share textbooks and how there&rsquo;s no computers in their classrooms.  No computers in schools?  Majority white schools must purchase computers out of their smaller budgets or student fund-drives,  whereas minority schools receive free computers from liberals such as Bill Gates.<br>
Then there&rsquo;s the fact that many white parents are forced to pay twice for their childs education.  They initially are forced to pay taxes to fund public education.  Of course when these schools become overrun with minorities, financially capable whites are left with no choice but to remove their child from these hellholes and send them to private schools for their own safety, where again white parents must pay.<br>
All in all, these afrocentric schools are a good sign, as long as they allow for taxpayer funded white schools also.  But even if they don&rsquo;t, removal of a few black students from the presence of our white students is never a bad thing.  Am I wrong?</p>

			<p>Some of the posters above are missing the point. Public opposition to the school is not an expression of right-wing populism; it&rsquo;s based on the liberal view that integrated/&rsquo;inclusive&rsquo;/multiculturalist education is the only legitimate form, and that any move towards &#8216;segregation&rsquo; is bad.  </p>

			<p>Why should the Canadian taxpayers at ANY level be compelled to provide funds to support an alien culture?  They didn&rsquo;t bring the Blacks to Canada via slavery, and they owe them nothing.  Canadian Blacks have a duty to assimilate to Canadian culture, not vice versa.  Accordingly, if Canadian Blacks want Afrocentric education, they should foot the bill for it themselves.</p>
<p>Canadians should immediately mobilize to throw out of office every local / national politician who advocates such abuse of the taxpayers and their national culture.</p>

Let them SEGREGATE themselves (something they deny to everyone else).</p>
<p>Let them educate these kids by any means and method of their choosing.</p>
<p>Let them hire black teachers, principles, administrators.</p>
<p>Let them use textbooks and curriculum that promotes every idea they want to believe and instill in their youth.</p>
<p>But, in the end, let their choices, their methods, their teacher, their books, and their curriculum be held up as causing the failure that this is destined to be.</p>
<p>Let them do everything they want their way but when it&rsquo;s all said and done, let these people take responsibility for the mess they are going to create. I don&rsquo;t want to hear anyone turn around later and say, &#8216;the reason it didn&rsquo;t work is because we didn&rsquo;t receive support or encouragement. It failed because of institutional racism and we weren&rsquo;t allowed to do things our way, the black way, the right way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let them put up or shut up. Let them prove their educational theories in a real life experiment. Let them sink or swim.</p>
<p>Let them rule in hell rather than serve in heaven. </p>

			<p>I wish all black people wanted to go to Afrocentric schools or leave in Afrocentric neighborhoods.</p>
<p>I think white people would gladly support that with their tax dollars.</p>
<p>But guess what? Blacks will quickly turn them into a complete mess and do what they always do:</p>
<p>Move into white neighborhoods or try to get into white schools.     </p>

			<p>The sad fact is that 50-60% of blacks do not finish high school in Toronto. The hope is that an Afro-centric education will help them to improve that number. How exactly that works is another issue&hellip;<br>
The same curriculum, taught by black teachers  = higher passing rates ? I don&rsquo;t see how that can be a solution. Eventually, everyone is competing in the same place - the global economy. And if they think high school in Toronto is tough, wait till they come  up against the competition from Asia, Europe etc.</p>

<p>Oh but don&rsquo;t you know the poor little dears have been victims of &#8220;white racism&#8221; all over the globe. Since many white Canadians are the decendents of the english/french who colonized africa, they &#8220;owe&#8221; them something. After all, if whites had never colonized africa, it would be a successful paradise.LOL &#8220;Sarcasm Off&#8221;-It doesn&rsquo;t matter how africans arrive somewhere, it will always be the white man&rsquo;s fault and the white man will always owe them.</p>

<p>Anyone want to bet the results will be LOUSY???</p>
