						<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) &mdash; Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Monday decried anti-immigrant perceptions in the United States and argued that Mexican immigrants complement American workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst thing that happened in this country is this anti-Mexican or anti-immigrant perception of people. We need to contain this,&#8221; Calderon said after a speech at Harvard&rsquo;s John F. Kennedy School of Government.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need to change in Mexico the perception that the Americans are the enemy, and it is important to change the perception that the Mexicans are the enemy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are neighbors, we are friends and we must be allies.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You have two economies. One economy is intensive in capital, which is the American economy. One economy is intensive in labor, which is the Mexican economy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are two complementary economies, and that phenomenon is impossible to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The American economy is suffering, but if you take the point of view that the solution for this situation, a lack of competitiveness of the American economy, is closing the border, you are making a very big mistake,&#8221; Calderon said.</p>
<p>During his speech, Calderon said that he had worked hard to combat drug gangs in Mexico but that the effort would be long, costly and difficult. He also pointed a finger at the U.S., saying the drug trade in Mexico is contingent on the demand for illegal drugs north of the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drugs are not just our problem. We are the neighbor of the largest consumer in the world,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>Calderon is even worse than V Fox in ternms of arrogance and hypocracy.But that is not any departure from the history of Mexican presidents.Every one of them has been a corrupt crook, and completely useless.The only prez that I hate more than him  is our own.</p>

<p>No, Mr. Calderon! The assassination of JFK (had the place Mr. Calderon spoke at, named after him) was far worse (unrelated to illegal immigration, though; it&rsquo;s worse than pro-White &#8220;racism&#8221;)!The fact is: American job losses to illegal Mexican immigrants are far worse! The crimes, including theft, battery, molestation, rape, and even murder, committed against Americans, by illegal Mexicans, are far worse! And who is he to point the finger at us? Mexico actually had a stamp(s?) mocking Blacks! I actually hear more Mexicans saying the &#8220;n-word&#8221; than Whites. I also hear that many Mexicans (though not all) want to exterminate Whites (at least on the North American continent)! But we are &#8220;racist,&#8221; for wanting to enforce our race-neutral (disregarding race) immigration laws (while Hispanics already comprises of about 80% of our legal immigrants, alone). I am sure he would think differently, if Whites and Blacks were about to absorb Mexicans, instead of vice-versa). </p>
<p>Also, with our upcoming economic crisises, we will be losing jobs; and hiring &#8220;victimized&#8221; illegal aliens, will be the least of our concerns. </p>

			<p>Perhaps President Calderon requires reminding about (a) how Mexico very forcefully rejects undocumented immigrants from Central America, and (b) how Mexico refuses to extend the same rights and privileges to American citizen visitors &amp; immigrants to Mexico that it demands for Mexican citizens in the USA.</p>

			<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) &mdash; Mexican President Felipe Calderon&hellip;argued that Mexican immigrants complement American workers.</p>
<p>How do illegal Mexican immigrants complement American workers?</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;The worst thing that happened in this country is this anti-Mexican or anti-immigrant perception of people. We need to contain this,&rdquo; Calderon said&hellip;</p>
<p>The worst thing to happen in this country is the PATRIOT Act. <br>
What you need to contain, Calderon, is your people in Mexico. Why can&rsquo;t they find work in your country?  Why not talk about how you treat legal and illegal immigrants in Mexico who are less than second class citizens? Strange how you can make such remarks in America, but in Mexico, should a foreigner make such remarks, s/he would be immediately deported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are neighbors, we are friends and we must be allies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neighbors do NOT enter each others houses/property without explicit permission, so if we are neighbors, why do your people enter their neighbor&rsquo;s land without permission? Or maybe Mexicans do not have the ability to respect others.</p>
<p> &ldquo;We are two complementary economies, and that phenomenon is impossible to stop.&rdquo; </p>
<p>We are NOT two complementary economies. Mexico&rsquo;s economy is oil, money sent to Mexico by illegals, and drug money. That is Mexico&rsquo;s economy in that order. Take the illegal Mexicans out of the US and Mexico&rsquo;s economy will fall as they will no longer be receiving the billions of dollars sent to Mexico by illegals in the US. What is  impossible for you to stop Calderon, is the importation of illegal drugs into Mexico.</p>
<p>Calderon said that the drug trade in Mexico is contingent on the demand for illegal drugs north of the border.</p>
<p>OK Calderon, where do the drugs come from? Inside or outside of Mexico? Why outside of course. How are drugs entering Mexico? What are you doing to stop drugs from entering Mexico? Nothing because you know drug money is important to keep Mexico&rsquo;s economy running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drugs are not just our problem. We are the neighbor of the largest consumer in the world,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>With that typical Mexican logic, Mexico must be the largest importer and exporter of illegal drugs in the world. If Mexico were to end the illegal importation of drugs into their country, Mexico would end the exportation of drugs from Mexico into the States.</p>
<p>But, then again, Mexicans have no logic as Calderon clearly evidenced by his own words. Calderon, you can not meet with any of the presidential contenders because you and they know that your presence on their campaign trail would be their death knell.</p>
<p>Calderon, wake up, the American people DO NOT want illegals in their country. The American people rallied and let their united voice be heard and the amnesty proposal was DOA. What you do not seem to comprehend is that America welcomes LEGAL immigrants. </p>
<p>So why are you really in the US? What is your real agenda? Having lived in Mexico for seven years, I have learned that Mexicans always have a hidden agenda. What is yours?</p>

			<p>&#8220;We need to contain this&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Fewer more chilling words can be said by a politician. Especially when considering the thing he is referring to is a naturally occurring self defense mechanism in the minds of a population. A population he has no place in. He speaks with full conviction that attitudes are material substances which can just be swept up and put into containers somewhere. No surprise from a machine man such as himself. Of course the mechanical manipulation of the contents of peoples minds can only be affected through propaganda, which is a thing that all free men will always fight against.<br>
He also says &#8220;We&#8221; as though there is in fact, such a thing. It would be nice of him to realize that America is not a tandem identity theoretical construct, but a sovereign nation he should properly refer to as &#8220;you&#8221;.<br>
Nicer still to realize that mere physical proximity does not in any real sense constitute what is meant in the word &#8220;neighbor&#8221;.<br>
Similarly, &#8220;complimentary economies&#8221; do not in themselves constitute warrant for the shotgun wedding he is angling for and which none of us want.<br>
At least he was thoughtlessly honest enough to voice the fact that Mexicans consider Americans to be enemies. (paragraph 3).<br>
That is a quote we will do well to file away in our fact arsenals and use whenever appropriate.<br>
Two final points:<br>
Calderon states that we are making a very big mistake (by closing the border). He states this as though he has a position to say anything about the matter. He also (characteristically) states this ignoring the fact that free people are free to make their own mistakes, and as though he has authority to prevent us from making such a &#8216;mistake&rsquo;. Dealing with the consequences of &#8216;mistakes&rsquo; is not a strong suit of the people who he represents anyway, so the entire statement is moot.<br>
Finally, he states that &#8220;we MUST be allies&#8221; <br>
Its hard not to first consider Mexicos refusal to be a part of &#8216;the coalition of the willing&rsquo; when we began our Middle East adventure, or Bush&rsquo;s refusal to count Mexico with Iraq in light of his &#8220;either you&rsquo;re with us or you&rsquo;re with the terrorists&#8221; dictum. More importantly, any &#8220;ally&#8221; who you &#8216;must&rsquo; join with is in no way an ally, but a conscript.<br>
These things are all said with full recognition of the futility of believing that logic has any part in any of this, and that since Mexican hypocrisy knows no bounds, speaking about it may be an equal futility.<br>
Speak, though, we must.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Monday decried anti-immigrant perceptions in the United States and argued that Mexican immigrants complement American workers&#8221;</p>
<p>No, mexican illegals(they&rsquo;re not immigrants) lower wages and take american jobs. Traitor white americans who hire them are equally to blame.</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst thing that happened in this country is this anti-Mexican or anti-immigrant perception of people. We need to contain this,&rdquo; Calderon said after a speech at Harvard&rsquo;s John F. Kennedy School of Government&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the worst thing for YOU Mr.Calderon. If America ceases to allow herself to be a dumping ground for your countries failures, than YOU Mr.Calderon might actually have to do your job as president.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;I need to change in Mexico the perception that the Americans are the enemy, and it is important to change the perception that the Mexicans are the enemy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are neighbors, we are friends and we must be allies.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what Mexicans think of the USA and yes, when millions of you illegally invade OUR country, you are the enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;You have two economies. One economy is intensive in capital, which is the American economy. One economy is intensive in labor, which is the Mexican economy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are two complementary economies, and that phenomenon is impossible to stop.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>No, we have ONE economy, the american economy. Our economy compliments Mexico, you country drags us down. It is possible to stop, very easy to do so in only 3 steps.<br>
1-Build the 2000 mile fence.<br>
2-Slam white american traitors who hire mexicans<br>
3-Get rid of the anchor baby provisions<br>
See, problemo solved</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Drugs are not just our problem. We are the neighbor of the largest consumer in the world,&rdquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably true, even more reason why we need to close the border.</p>

<p>Say Calderon, as he winks and slaps the back of the drug dealers who bring billions of dollars into Mexico every year.  </p>
<p>Between the cash flows created from trafficking of illegal drugs and the remittances from illegal immigrants, Calderon can sit back and enjoy the fruits of other&rsquo;s labors and sorrows.</p>

			<p>And the anti-immigrant sentiment and laws of Mexico are what? LEGENDARY. Why is this the right thing to do in Calderon&rsquo;s nation, and the wrong thing for ours? Mexico&hellip;the worlds biggest hypocrite.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American economy is suffering, but&hellip;closing the border, you are making a very big mistake&#8221;.</p>
<p>No, we already made a big mistake by allowing avarice to become accepted as national policy. By not prosecuting the politicians and the employers who have stolen our future. By bringing in immigrants, legal and illegal, instead of investing in our own youth, our own future. We made a big mistake in not closing the border long ago. We will fix our mistakes. </p>
<p>BTW Calderon, we are not complementary economies, and never were. Unless you are thinking parasite and host. &#8216;Complementary&rsquo; assumes Mexico is contributing something of value to that equation. Imagine if 100 percent of Mexico&rsquo;s citizens vanished from the earth tomorrow. Most of all, those on this side of the border. The effect on the lives of the American citizens&hellip;zilch. Well, not quite true. Our lives would improve dramatically.</p>

			<p>Calderon is right.  Mexico is not the enemy.  American White marxists who advocate open borders are the enemy.  </p>
<p>Mexico also has an illegal immigration problem on it&rsquo;s southern border.  They have the Army use live ammo to deal with it.  Americans and other foreigners who wish to live in Mexico have to show they have a certain minimum income.  No welfare for gringos.  </p>
<p>Maybe we should learn from Calderon&rsquo;s real opinion on illegal immigration.  </p>

<p>Well, dangerous to stop if you want to live, if you don&rsquo;t want to become another JFK.  The dark forces have made their decree: a north American union, a new currency called the Amero linked to the Euro, then the NA union joins with the EU, the African Union and the Asian union.  One world, The New World Order, one government controlled by the bankers, total control of humanity. <br>
 <br>
&#8216;And pointing to the New World Order oligarchs, the Orthodox Christian Vladimir Putin said in a November 2007 speech to Russian Military Cadets: <br>
- &#8220;There are those who would like to build a unipolar world, who would themselves like to rule all of humanity.&#8221; -Reuters </p>
<p>But, Senior Felipe Calderon, nothing is impossible.  The only union the Rockefellers and their ilk will create is a union of humanity against THEM.  Yes, Snr. Calderon, believe me when I say you will live to hear the words &#8216;Cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war&rsquo; then there will be &#8216;wailing and gnashing of teeth&rsquo; and the money-lenders will be sent straight to hell.  </p>
<p>You can then sit back, have a tacco, strum your big guitar and go back to thinking small - and being content.</p>

			<p>I love it when these blowhards come to America and start badmouthing us. They should do it more often. As a matter of fact, they should buy network TV airtime, preferably during American Idol or Monday Night Football and REALLY let us have it. Tell us what racists we are and how we have no right to defend our country and our national interests. I really wish they would do that. Maybe then the rest of America would get mad instead of just the ones paying attention.</p>

<p>I can remember about a decade or so ago a man on late night TV espousing a similar plan. I remember thinking he was a kook. However, I don&rsquo;t think that way anymore.

			<p>If Calderon wants to whine, first send him back all the criminals, drug smugglers, rapists, gang bangers, drunk drivers and counterfitters. Then send him a bill for about $400 billion payable in oil; that should cover the hospital, police, school and welfare bills.  Then we can have that utopian conversation about being friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>Can anybody tell me how many Mexican troops were sent to Afganistan or Iraq by our &#8220;allies&#8221; Fox and Calderon? To be specific I&rsquo;m refering to those currently serving in the Mexican military, not illegals in the U.S. military. Oops, I forgot they have a prior commitment providing security for drug smugglers at the U.S. border.  </p>

<p>And those Americans who arrange it are subverive agents acting treasonously.</p>

<p>In Mexico they can us force to &#8220;contain&#8221; it.  How long will it be before they can use force to &#8220;contain&#8221; it here?</p>

			<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if we had a President that would travel to Mexico, visit all the dignitaries and tell that how great the American people are? In my fantasy, he would tell them that he would no longer see his people losing jobs to the illegal aliens from Mexico. He would elaborate on the fact that they would no longer be forced to pay for the upkeep of illegals - not their schooling, their health care or their many incarcerations. And, all their little bundles of joy would be paid by them. If they have money to send &#8220;home,&#8221; they have money to pay for the necessities of life. In fact, my dream President would say, &#8220;Presidente Calderon, I would like you to leave and take your 30 million illegals with you. Flash&hellip;they are your citizens, not ours. Adios.&#8221;</p>

THey are terrified by the possibility that the unwashed, uneducated criminals might end up back where they came from.</p>

<p>This is so laughable one doesn&rsquo;t know where to begin. Is ex-presidente Calderon trying to convince us that he isn&rsquo;t aware of his own country&rsquo;s treatment of illegals? (or the distinction between legal and illegal?)<br>
Illegals coming into Mexico are arrested, stripped of all rights of any kind, and thrown into a gulag.</p>
<p>The quickest way to shut up this kind of hubris is to ask el ex-presidente if he would mind if the U.S. repealed all of its immigration laws and put those of his country in their place.</p>

			<p>The pot calls the kettle black. Go read up on Mexico&rsquo;s immigration policies.Return all illegals to Mexico. Maybe in a few years they&rsquo;ll become so fed up that they&rsquo;ll revolt and overthrow their government. For years our country has become a sort of a safety valve for the pressures building up south of the border. It&rsquo;s time to end all that and make the Mexican government more responsive to the needs of its own people. </p>

			<p>Calderon surmises that something unseen and unheard(perception), and never be proven(anti-hypothetical) is far worst than hundreds of thousands of documented rapes and murders.  Calderon, chief mestizo, must have skipped his philosophy courses in the fine mexican school of thought.</p>

			<p>So does Mr. Calderon think that every time a young girl, or young boy, or child for that matter (children are attempted targets by drug pushers) are introduced to drugs, that these young girls, boys, children, WANTED to become addicted to drugs?  That they WANTED to become a source of income for predatory drug pushers?  That they WANTED to become possibly murdered by Mexican drug runners?  They WANTED those things?</p>
<p>That sounds something like what a (mind)rapist would say.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it?  &#8220;You know you &#8216;wanted&rsquo; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where is King Juan Carlos of Spain when we need him?  I wish he would tell Calderon to shut up, like he did Hugo Chavez.</p>

<p>Well, for starters, by continuing his support for Amnesty and Open Borders. Or for allowing another half-million or so of his African kin here   &mdash;   political refugees, you know! </p>
<p>Seriously: I do hope RON PAUL will have the intestinal fortitude to launch himself as a third-party alternative for the Presidency. Faced with the unspeakably dismal choice of McCain vs. either Clinton or Obama, a lot of Americans WOULD figure that an HONEST politican (PAUL) would be far more desirable than either of the others. But really WHO in their right mind would want another four-year Billary Clinton Administration?</p>

<p>It is beyond bizarre that Mexico would want to get rid of such valuable hard workers - unless, that is, they weren&rsquo;t valuable to Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexico appears to be the best used car salesman on the planet, and American politicians (and naive citizens) the most gullible shoppers ever.</p>
