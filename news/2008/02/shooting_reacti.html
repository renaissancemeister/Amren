						<p>With so many people asking why, a brother of gunman Charles Lee &#8220;Cookie&#8221; Thornton provided answers Friday that prompted fresh anger over the shooting rampage at a Kirkwood City Council meeting Thursday.</p>
<p>Gerald Thornton told reporters in front of Kirkwood&rsquo;s City Hall that his brother had had enough of his fight with the city. Thornton pointedly refused to judge his brother&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>&#8220;He himself tried what he considered all the avenues he had available,&#8221; Gerald Thornton said. &#8220;For him to build up the need to go and do what he did, it had to be on the same level as a person that would declare war.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a neighborhood meeting in the mostly black Meacham Park neighborhood, where Thornton lived, people cried, prayed and spoke of a racial divide. Some spoke sympathetically of Thornton and his rage over repeated parking and permit citations. One man called him a &#8220;hero.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many say they are sickened by Thornton&rsquo;s brand of vigilantism. But others say they&rsquo;re left outside the mainstream and oppressed by unfair rules. Those people mourned Thornton and directed their anger back at Kirkwood officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are rules and we make them and enforce them,&#8221; said Collinsville Mayor Stan Schaeffer, a friend of Kirkwood Mayor Mike Swoboda, critically injured in the shootings. &#8220;On the other hand, emotions run high when your property and your rights are perceived to be violated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cable television on Friday broadcast Gerald Thornton&rsquo;s statements across the country: &#8220;This was an act of war by my brother. He had people that he was in battle with.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gerald Thornton has his own history of violence. He spent more than five years in prison for fatally stabbing a man in 1996.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Kirkwood, PJ&rsquo;s Tavern co-owner Bill Friedrichs said: &#8220;If they think that the only way to deal with these issues is through these means, there&rsquo;s a tremendous lack of understanding in that community, in Meacham Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the neighborhood, between Interstate 44 and railroad tracks, about 100 people &mdash; a third of them white &mdash; held a two-hour meeting Friday afternoon. The frustration was clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, Charles Thornton is a hero,&#8221; said Ben Gordon of Webster Groves. &#8220;He opened a business. He went to court, but the system failed him. &nbsp;.&nbsp.;&nbsp;. We are sorry, we grieve, but (Kirkwood officials) share in this responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry Jones, an elder at Men and Women of Faith Ministries, said a gulf exists between blacks and whites in Kirkwood, one that will take years to close.</p>

<p>When a crazed man, who refused to follow simple rules, kills innocent people that were merely doing their job, and then is made out to be a hero&hellip;.yep, thats going to cause a divide.  </p>

<p>When you have an IQ of 80 or less it will always be the white man&rsquo;s fault. When approached by the likes of &#8220;Cookie&#8221;, Gerald &amp; Ben Gordon of Webster Groves there&rsquo;s only one course of action and it&rsquo;s not cerebral discourse.</p>

<p>Damned right there is and it grew into a Grand Canyon sized chasm last week.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m a White man in the St. Louis area (fortunately I don&rsquo;t live there), I&rsquo;ll spend the rest of my mortal life making sure the same people that lionize the cowardly and dead Thornton don&rsquo;t EVER have have a chance to bring their &#8220;hero&#8221; values anywhere near me and mine.  If that means packing heat, so be it. </p>

			<p>The reaction of whites is sadly familiar. Condemning the &#8216;tragedy&rsquo; without acknowledging the fact that blacks are at war with them. Even with blacks flat out stating it in national media, our good, liberal, nonjudgmental whites still keep their head in the sand.  </p>

<p>The N.R.A used to say that gun control laws were racist.They were designed to prevent black people from owning guns.I guess those silly laws that denies gun rights to convicted felons are also racist.My question is how does a black convicted felon get a gun.The answer is from another black person.</p>

			<p>Leave it to blacks to romanticize violence, to include murder.  They&rsquo;ve been doing it since their first riot when they found it profitable to loot  vandalize, and otherwise their own neighborhoods.  Among blacks (who love all things government), rules and laws are for whites.  If you enforce them, you might get killed.</p>
<p>Blacks are an incredibly violent race and that, where ever they live in the world. </p>
<p>btw:  If this man murdered another man by stabbing him to death, why did he only serve five years?  </p>

			<p>What &#8220;avenues&#8221; did he try?  All he had to do was follow the rules like every other business owner but he didn&rsquo;t want to do that, he wanted to do whatever he wanted.  When he didn&rsquo;t get his way he resorted to murder.  This is no &#8220;hero&#8221; this is a despicable animal, and anyone who praises what he did is also a despicable animal.</p>

			<p>I hate to say it but I can understand to a great degree why this happened and it wouldn&rsquo;t break my heart if it happened to a significant number of our so-called leaders and corporate elite&hellip;and it probably will if they continue to back the working majority into a corner and make them feel they have nothing to lose.</p>

			<p> It seems that there are some questions that are not being answered here. News reports tell us &#8220;Cookie&#8221; Thornton received many parking tickets for his construction company vehicles. Has anyone established whether these were justified? Was he really the victim of some kind of deep, dark &#8220;racist plot&#8221;? Or was he just another paranoid black, wanting to blame &#8220;de man&#8221; for all his personal failings? Believe me, we&rsquo;ve had a couple of them right here in my midwestern hometown.<br>
 <br>
 What is this big &#8220;gulf&#8221; that supposedly exists between blacks and whites in Kirkwood? Has anyone pinpointed what these blacks are talking about when they say that? And under what circumstances can it ever be justified, as some of them insist,for a person to walk into a room and shoot dead five other people? When the murderer is black and the victims white?  </p>

			<p>Many, many blacks were gleeful about the mass killing that was committed by a black racist  on the subway tha in New York city in 1993, just read &#8220;The End of Racism&rsquo; by Dinesh Dsouza.Blacks always complain about the alleged racist leanings of Whitey,but they completely ignore it when they do the same thing.</p>

<p><br>
Always   &mdash;   ALWAYS   &mdash;   the liberal assumption that the gulf can be closed. What if it can&rsquo;t? What then?</p>
<p>Events like this dreadful bloodbath in MO   &mdash;   and the even more disgusting aftermath of black solidarity for a murder maniac   &mdash;   suggest that IF the gulf can be closed at all, it will take not years but centuries. Possibly even millennia. </p>

			<p>White America, you asked for it and now you&rsquo;re going to get it! If you think it&rsquo;s getting bad, wait until self loathing whites vote in Obama as the next president. Once we get the HAIC (head african in charge) the blacks will assume they have the upper hand and America will become the new Africa. Let&rsquo;s hope we don&rsquo;t get everything we deserve for destroying our own race.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But others say they&rsquo;re left outside the mainstream and oppressed by unfair rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Rules&#8221; they are talking about here is, of course, White Mans Law. You know, like parking tickets and fines for jaywalking. Rules we learn as children to be able to operate in a civilized manner and live in a civilized society, but are somehow racist to the black man. Next they will demand Islamic law (As they already do in the U.K.) or some made up Kwanzza type tribal code to live under.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know the details of this case but one thing I know: there was a time when most true Americans would have reacted as Mr. Thornton did had their liberties been usurped to the extent they&rsquo;re usurped today.  Would Davie Crockett have allowed government to dictate to him how he may modify his house?  How he must run his business?  How he must raise his kids?  I think not!  It&rsquo;s to our shame and disgrace that we tolerate being bossed around by government these days.  Do you think you own private property?  Wrong!  You don&rsquo;t; every thing you think you own, including your own bodies and children, belongs to the government (in its various levels) because they, ultimately, are the ones who decide what may be done with it.  In other words, we are slaves.  Slaves should, and will occasionally, rebel against their masters.  Again, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what happened here but y&rsquo;all should know that there have been white men who&rsquo;ve responded against government similarly and it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine being driven to such actions by the forces of government and their demands upon us.  There comes a time, for each of us, when we say, &#8220;enough is enough&#8221; and the time for talk and negotiations ends.  At that point we declare war on our oppressors.  The rebels in the South did it.  The American revolutionaries did it.  The Palestinians did it. Sooner or later, each of us will either die laying down or standing up.  Before Mr. Thornton went on his rampage, nobody was listening to him.  Now they&rsquo;re listening.  Whether he was wrong or right, we should remember who our true oppressors are: those in government and their obedient servants in the media.  There&rsquo;s too much to say about this within the scope of one comment but, if not for our government, we&rsquo;d have very little to fear from blacks, browns or Asians.<br>

			<p>If Kirkwood is so horrible to the citizens of Meacham Park, then they should part ways, and Meacham Park should become its own city.  And they can keep the two shopping centers that now sit where Meacham Park houses used to be, to have a revenue source for the new city.  Then they can show all us evil honkey crackers how to do it right.</p>

			<p>I see some very telling quotes here that really bring the problem into focus. Let me translate a few quotes here:</p>
<p>Quote: &#8220;But others say they&rsquo;re left outside the mainstream and oppressed by unfair rules.&#8221; </p>
<p>Translation:  Blacks (and Mexicans for that matter)should be exempt from rules that govern otherwise civilized societies. Only whites should abide by the law.  In fact, only whites need to be compassionate, sympathetic, patient, understanding and provide charity.</p>
<p>Quote:  &ldquo;He himself tried what he considered all the avenues he had available,&rdquo; </p>
<p>Translation:  Blacks can&rsquo;t figure out complicated &#8220;white&#8221; things like paying fines, obeying rules and not being able to do whatever comes into your mind and thinking about the consequences of your actions.</p>
<p>Quote:  One man called him a &ldquo;hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Translation:  If you&rsquo;re black and you get frustrated, killing white people is a perfectly honorable thing to do.</p>
<p>Quote:  &ldquo;This was an act of war by my brother. He had people that he was in battle with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Translation:  Blacks don&rsquo;t have to fight fair. You can kill unarmed white bystanders.</p>
<p>Quote: &#8220;Gerald Thornton has his own history of violence. He spent more than five years in prison for fatally stabbing a man in 1996.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation:  It was probably a white victim, so the 5-years in prison is actually a very long sentence for this black murderer.</p>
<p><br>
Quote: &#8220;&hellip; said a gulf exists between blacks and whites in Kirkwood, one that will take years to close.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tranlsation:  Black and white people can never live together, the gulf will never close.</p>
<p>Enough said.</p>

			<p>Can you even begin to imagine what would happen to a white who would defend another white who mercilessly slaughtered 5 blacks? They would be ostracized. They&rsquo;d get death threats. They would lose their jobs. If they didn&rsquo;t lose their jobs their workplace would be mercilessly picketed by blacks (who have time to do so since so many are on welfare, anyway).</p>

			<p>Although I have long known of the dangers and endless issues associated with Blacks, I never really held any personal animus toward them as people. We were different - we didin&rsquo;t fit together - and that was that. <br>
Over the years this perhaps overly naive view has dimmed considerably. I have grown to genuinely dislike&hellip;strongly dislike most American Blacks. Their behavior, attitudes and general demeanor is just obnoxious and intolerably so! The article above illustrates this point perfectly. </p>

			<p>I have news for Harry Jones. The gulf between blacks and whites widens everyday and will never close. Blacks have absolutely no sense of social propriety or morals. And when they get into trouble because they lack these basic sensibilities they start whining racism. And of course when this happens here comes Al and Jesse the ambulance chasers of the culture. It&rsquo;s just a vicious circle of bad choices within the culture.</p>

But when a Blacks are killed, most frequently brought on themselves in confrontations with law enforcement, there is a call to arms.</p>

			<p>  Theres a local radio station in Buffalo N.Y. in which I hear the host blaming essentially every disorder or mallady of the black community on the delusion of white racism. The other day there was a black woman advocating racial segregation. I say go right ahead, just give me back my taxes/welfare payments.</p>

			<p>The author of this article is right to a certain extent, this incident does show a racial divide, that is obvious, no argrument, but the main thing it shows is a society, (black Americans) whom have a severe lack of morals, they have been breeding offspring for some time now who are not able to live in a civil law abiding society.</p>

			<p>blacks are the worlds finest at one thing in particular and that is coming up with EXCUSES for every failure in their lives. And the sad thing is how many whites are like foolish sheep in agreement and apologetic for the weakness, laziness and foolishness of these black hypocrites. Many blacks would not hesitate to hurt or injure any white they come across and they frequesntly do. Non blacks and whites in particular better wake up before they have no means of protecting themselves from these heatless animals and then when their children and grandchildren are forced to live under the heavy cruel hand of the blacks they allowed to become strong, it will be too late. blacks don&rsquo;t demand and take power, we servie it up to them on a silver platter.</p>

			<p>I live in North St. Louis County. No one is guaranteed success in business. No businessman gets to pick and choice the laws they will obey. Other people have property rights too-the vacant lot owner. I note that the murderer didn&rsquo;t sue the city because the zoning laws weren&rsquo;t applied fairly but that he could no longer harass city officals at a public meeting-a federal judge said so in her dismissal of the case. This is one of the consequents of affirmative action; the belief that because I&rsquo;m  black, white people should guarantee my success and not hold me to the same rules as white people. Went that doesn&rsquo;t happen I can react with violence and should be excused. This nonsense can&rsquo;t go on forever and it won&rsquo;t, cracks  are starting to appear in the facade. Shepard Smith&rsquo;s remarks are just one small example of how it is getting harder and harder to pretend that the emperor is clothed.<br>

<i>&#8220;Amazing how when Blacks kill Whites there is always a call for &ldquo;healing&rdquo; from Blacks.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Here in Buffalo, we had two (among many) incidents of blacks killing whites. One involved a black guy killing a nun. The other involved a black neighbor who terrorized an elderly white woman and who then ultimately broke into her home, hit her on the head with a hammer and stabbed her in the neck with a screw driver and murdered her. In both instances (and especially the second), the black community came out with their leaders from the black community talking about healing. At one point, they held a vigil in front of the murdered elderly white woman&rsquo;s home. If I was a member of that family, I would have been out there swinging a baseball bat until the police put me down.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Many say they are sickened by Thornton&rsquo;s brand of vigilantism. But others say they&rsquo;re left outside the mainstream and oppressed by unfair rules.</p>
<p>A comment that eloquently speaks for the Afro-American mentality. Blacks have the unshakable conviction they should NEVER be held accountable for ANYTHING! Laws are only for Whitey. Blacks have the inalienable right to do or say whatever they feel like; whenever they feel like.</p>
<p>They believe a Black should, at birth, be issued a life-long GET OUT OF JAIL, FREE! card, granting perpetual immunity for any crime that Black will commit in later life. No, of course they won&rsquo;t ADMIT this belief publicly, but any and every time a Black, ANY Black is charged with a crime, the race card is imediately brandished.</p>
<p>These people simply are lacking the mental ability to understand a society cannot function without sane and reasonable laws and restrictions. That laws, whether they are parking regulations or zoning laws   &mdash;   are for the common good   &mdash;   benefiting the majority of the people even if an inconvenience on a personal level. But that that&rsquo;s the difference between White human beings and Blacks&hellip; Blacks simply cannot grasp that concept.</p>

<p>&#8220;St. Louis has a racial problem&#8221;  -  the white people in St. Louis are not submitting to black pressure as blacks would like.</p>
<p>&#8220;white government is oppressing the black minority&#8221;  - black genetic traits and dispositions are not well suited for a white society and the white folks are not sufficiently adjusting to suit them.</p>
<p>&#8220;a gulf exists between blacks and whites in Kirkwood, one that will take years to close.&rdquo;  -  an IQ and behavioral trait gulf that can only be lessened by years of race mixing in an Obamanation.</p>

			<p>The Duke LaCrosse situation is the one that really woke me up. Since then I have been reading and observing &#8220;race&#8221; relations.<br>
I now avoid Africans every chance I get. I avoid them in a store, a mall, everywhere.</p>
<p>For example, in the moring I get a cup of coffee at a local convenience store. If I see an African in there, I am prone to stay in the car and listen to morning hate talk radio. When he leaves, then I go in. </p>
<p>If an African enters the store, while I am in it, I keep an eye on him. I will NOT let him be behind me in line, but I will move around such that I am behind him. I alwasy watch his hands and I am always ready to act.</p>
<p>In a China-Mart (Wal-Mart) I avoid groups of Africans. If I see some, I will go down another aisle. I use a different check out line but watch them. </p>
<p>When I pull into a parking lot, I will first look about for any groups of canadians. I always park away from all other cars so no car blocks me in the front or sides. Plus when I am walking to my car I can see all around it. I have taught my wife that.</p>
<p>When at my car, I look around constantly. If any canadians are near by, I stand there and look at them. Let them know I see them. I get in my truck/van/car (I own 3 vehicles) while I constantly watch them. In the truck/van/car, I put my Glock on the seat beside me. (Usually it is in the door pocket since I can get to it while using the door as a cover as I open the door)</p>
<p>For those of you who have made fun of those of us talking about guns, don&rsquo;t you see that we were alwasy right? If Obama wins, it will be open season on whites. If he doesn&rsquo;t win, expect violent riots in the typical multicultural diverse neighborhoods  (&#8220;communities&#8221;). You had best buy guns NOW since the government already has on the books the necessary paper work for a &#8220;State of Emergency&#8221; where the first stores to be closed will be any gun shop. (They will keep the liqour stores open, I&rsquo;ll bet).</p>

			<p>One thing I&rsquo;d like to point out is that much of the blame for black behavior lies with whites.  Do you blame a lion for hunting when released from its cage?</p>
<p>White liberals have turned black America loose, and made it very clear that they can get away with murder if they scream &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>How is that blacks&rsquo; fault?  When whites put pressure on blacks, blacks&rsquo; behavior was much better.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame blacks for being what they are, I blame whites for betraying their own for personal gain, and other civilized groups for aiding and abetting this insanity for their own ethnic interest.</p>

<p>This is very close to an analogy I&rsquo;ve used to highlight my point above about who&rsquo;s responsible for black misbehavior; this poor simpleton is now likely to go around telling people he&rsquo;s not retarded, get very agitated when treated differently, etc.  He&rsquo;d be much better off facing his own limitations, rather than being told the world is to blame for his difficulties.</p>
<p>P.S., I don&rsquo;t mean to absolve blacks for blame, merely to point out that they are incompatible with our society, <b>unable</b> to live up to our norms, that it is wrong for us to expect them to, and white liberal behavior has made black behavior even worse than it has to be.</p>

The Whites in Kirkwood are ALREADY saying that THEY have to meet with the blacks of Meacham Park to start the &#8220;healing.&#8221; In the minds of most blacks, &#8220;healing&#8221; means more affirmative action, section 8 housing,welfare etc.. White people always reward blacks for assaulting them, and then wonder why blacks keep attacking them! These same spineless Whites will probably even put up a statue of &#8220;Cookie&#8221; in front of City Hall where they can gather every year to place flowers, light candles and hold hands with their black brothers and sisters in &#8220;racial harmony! Sometimes I wonder how I can sleep at night!!  </p>

<p>The pacification of whites depends on the presumption that the government is basically fair, ethical and efficient. It certainly isn&rsquo;t fair, it&rsquo;s not quite ethical, and it&rsquo;s only somewhat efficient. But if you think it&rsquo;s bad now then wait until &#8220;underrespresented minorities&#8221; (blacks and Hispanics) become much larger portions of the government, especially the criminal justice system, than they already are. Government breaks down, starts acting as if this were a Third World country, and it&rsquo;s back to the Wild Wild West. And we saw what folks in the Wild West did to the Injuns, didn&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t to say that a race war is in the future. That&rsquo;s to say that if we&rsquo;re all wrong, and a multicultural future isn&rsquo;t so bad, then there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about - we&rsquo;re just a bunch of pessimists. If we&rsquo;re right, and multiculturalism means tyrrany, then whites won&rsquo;t sit idly by.</p>

<p>What an absurd comment.  Perhaps the Kirkwood officials shouldn&rsquo;t have stepped in front of the bullets?  If I recall, a previous article indicated that Kirkwood had offered to forgive the outstanding fines in exchange for a promise to obey ordinances in the future.  &#8220;Cookie&#8221; apparently didn&rsquo;t like that answer.

			<p>Ten things To Do Before The Election:</p>
<p>1. Clean your rifle.</p>
<p>2. Clean your handgun.</p>
<p>3. Sharpen your knives.</p>
<p>4. Lay in stocks of water purification supplies, ammo, and food.</p>
<p>5. Make sure you vehicles&rsquo; gas tanks are always at least half full.</p>
<p>6. Make arrangements as to where you are going when the cities erupt into riots.</p>
<p>7. If at all possible, pre-position supplies at that location.</p>
<p>8. Buy, and take physical possession of, gold and silver.</p>
<p>9. If your loved ones don&rsquo;t already know how, teach them to defend themselves. This will involve teaching a change in society&rsquo;s normal rules of engagement, i.e. defend yourself AT ALL COSTS.</p>
<p>10 . KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT about your preparations.</p>
<p>If Barack Hussein Obama wins the presidency, the cities will explode in alleged &#8220;victory&#8221; celebrations. If he loses, the cities will explode because racist Whites kept their homie from winning.</p>

			<p>A black felon with a gun who murders unarmed whites is a &#8220;hero&#8221; while a white who attempts to defend himself against black thugs is a &#8220;racist&#8221;.<br>
American blacks have in many cases succeeded in obtaining the veneer of respectability.  What lies underneath is the same old tribal savagery that can be seen in South Africa on a daily basis.<br>
There was a very good reason that Lincoln wanted to found a society for the repatriation of blacks and did not think that whites and blacks could live together in the same society.<br>
Of course the white latte liberals will likely elect Obama to the presidency;  just imagine America ruled by your typical African strong man  &mdash;  -this will surely help raise the already overconfident level of black self-esteem.  Perhaps then it will become legal to murder whites, as long as they are innocent and unarmed.</p>

			<p>Lucas, very good post.  I would add this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Thornton&hellip;had twice been convicted of disorderly conduct for disrupting meetings in May 2006&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Thornton insisted that Kirkwood officials violated his constitutional rights to free speech by barring him from speaking at the meetings&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation:  Blacks&rsquo; idea of civil discourse is to interrupt, disrupt and especially Shout Down those with whom they disagree.</p>
<p>Whites have No Right to challenge this black right not afforded to Whites and if their demands are not met, resorting to violence is an acceptable alternative to get the point across because they are &#8216;oppressed by unfair rules.&rsquo;  Rules that everyone but blacks must follow, of course.<br>
  <br>
In the black community, this is seen as heroic.</p>
<p> As I realize that black have limited reasoning power, I have learned in dealing with them to raise my voice (as they do) look them in the eye when I&rsquo;m speaking, and speak in short, strong declarative sentences. And even then, they usually won&rsquo;t see any other way except their own.  </p>
<p>And after studying black crime rates, I avoid them as much as possible.</p>

			<p>This nonsense is the same excuse Brian Nichols used  for killing 4 people ( a black plus 3 whites)and wounding, carjacking, and terrorizing others (black, white, &Asian;) when he went on his infamous crime spree at an Atlanta courthouse 3 yrs. ago next month. The justice system &#8220;is unfair to blacks&#8221;? Nichols admitted the judge he killed had been fair to him, and the guy was a bleeding heart.</p>

			<p>There is a widespread belief among blacks that laws should not apply to them: Laws are just white man&rsquo;s tools of oppression, you see. And likewise that blacks should be able to criminally victimize whites freely. This is now widely taught in law schools across the country as &ldquo;Critical Race Theory&rdquo;. A typical example is Regina Austin, a widely PRAISED black racist professor at University of Pennsylvania:<br>
<a href="https://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2168" rel="nofollow">https://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2168</a><br>
&ldquo;Austin pours scorn on such &ldquo;traditional values&rdquo; as &ldquo;conformity to the law,&rdquo; which she insists will &ldquo;intensif[y] divisions within the black community.&rdquo; Austin has also called on blacks to engage in outright lawbreaking, &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This makes you really want to hire blacks doesn&rsquo;t it? It is black Nazis like this academic parasite, living off working whites&rsquo; tax dollars so she can spend full time encouraging extreme racial hatred against whites, who are in reality the REAL oppressors of blacks, encouraging the rampant pathological behaviors that are the root cause of blacks&rsquo; woes.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is a LAW professor at a public university teaching and advocating LAWLESSNESS. Since this part of her courses she teaches she should be FIRED for incompetence. Just as an astronomy professor teaching as fact astrology would be FIRED. Not to mention her abusing her position for advancing a black Nazi agenda and hate-whitey propaganda.<br>
&ldquo;Asked in a 1999 interview to describe how she views her role as a legal scholar, Austin answered that it &ldquo;should start with the premise that black people are at the center of the universe and go on from there.&rdquo; Imagine a white professor saying this, but substituting &ldquo;white&rdquo; for &ldquo;black&rdquo;: There&rsquo;d be a national scandal and he&rsquo;d be immediately fired. <br>

			<p>The Whites in Kirkwood are ALREADY saying that THEY have to meet with the blacks of Meacham Park to start the &ldquo;healing.&rdquo;<br>
In the minds of most blacks, &ldquo;healing&rdquo; means more affirmative action, section 8 housing,welfare etc.. White people always reward blacks for assaulting them, and then wonder why&hellip;. Tom S.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&#8220;Start the healing&#8221;.   It really means start the white groveling.  Start the appeasement. Start the bootlicking.  PLEASE don&rsquo;t attack us and kill us any more!    We promise to reward you if you&rsquo;ll just  be nice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Healing&#8221;   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s one of the racially loaded terms (like &#8220;Change&#8221;)  that starts a slow fire in me.    I&rsquo;d rather root out the cancer than try to &#8220;heal&#8221; it.</p>

Very interesting post about Prof. Regina Austin!   But incompetence?  No, it&rsquo;s something much worse than that.   Incompetence is at least involuntary, but it&rsquo;s not wilful, it&rsquo;s not evil.  And, btw, please don&rsquo;t call them Nazis. (Nazis deserve better.) </p>
<p>Why, I wonder,  do whites put up with this? When will it end?   I fear, perhaps only after a new Dark Age has fallen upon us   &mdash;   as some posters here are ominously predicting.  Only then, after centuries of misery and turmoil have passed, the new civilization that emerges from the crucible will be utterly transformed from the old, and nothing will ever be the same again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like emerging from an ice age, or the periodic kill-offs that have hit the planet: when life emerges once again, everything is fresh and new and radically changed;  the old experiment is forever over.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting item on MSN News&hellip; of all things</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;It&rsquo;s hard to shock people in this modern wired world, but even the chief deputy of the Hillsborough County Sheriff&rsquo;s office in Florida found the security camera video of a jailer dumping a paralyzed man out of his wheelchair appalling</p>
<p>The picture and video show the deputy to be a Black female, the paralyzed victim WHITE!</p>
<p>Now picture the national stink were the racial identities reversed!!! Certainly worth of front-page exposure for at least a month, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?  OH, SORRY! I am so dumb. I completely forgot that race crimes can only be termed as such where the victim is Black, the perp is White. This story has to be considered a misunderstanding or at worst, an industrial accident or something similar.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The deputy shown dumping Sterner on the floor, Charlette Marshall-Jones, 44, has been suspended without pay while the sheriff&rsquo;s office investigates the incident. Three other deputies who witnessed the incident without objection have been placed on administrative leave.</p>
<p>But bet on it, the deputy will receive her back pay with interest and probably a bonus when the race hustlers, Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson (that name reminds me of something similar-sounding but not quite complimentary) get into the act.</p>
<p>Does ANYONE really not understand WHY there is so much anti-Black feeling, even hatred or anger, sweeping over our country. Given the reality that for EVERY race-motivated crime by a White person, there are probably A HUNDRED BLACK-ON-WHITE race crimes perpetrated annually.</p>

			<p>We found out today (Wednesday, February 13), in the wake of the funeral of Alderwoman Connie Karr that, even though she lived in northwestern Kirkwood, fairly close to Sen. Claire McCaskill (who attended the services), she served as the Secretary of the Meacham Park Neighborhood Association, which is the polar opposite of Kirkwood from her geographically, economically and racially.  And she was lauded for her efforts to try to reconcile black and white Kirkwood.</p>
<p>Therefore, the pattern here is that Swoboda, Yost, Carr and Hessel all tried to do Thornton himself and/or the African-American community (New Orleans&rsquo;s, in Yost&rsquo;s case) a favor, and they were shot, killed or targeted in spite of it.  Or maybe because of it.</p>

			<p>The tone of most articles is that &#8220;cookie&#8221; committed a wrong, but that the evil white establishment really pushed him too far.  The majority of blacks will see this murderer as a victim and hero, especially because he killed white people, the archenemy of the innocent black race.  And believe me when I tell you that most blacks see themselves at war with white people.</p>
<p>Blacks, being totally emotional and irrational, care nothing for the facts of this case and they&rsquo;ll always rationalize murders of innocent white people. Further, they really don&rsquo;t understand or agree with municipal rules and regulations which is why black run cities and towns are in total disarray.  It&rsquo;s a race thing.  They don&rsquo;t get us and we don&rsquo;t get them.  </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really galling is for &#8220;jewamongyou&#8221; to liken &#8220;cookie&#8221; to some liberty loving fredom fighter or Davy Crockett is completely nuts. But then again his screen name explains everything.  </p>
<p>Cookie is no black Randy Weaver protecting his family and property from renegade feds.  He&rsquo;s a cold blooded criminal who had no right to breath the same air as white people of Kirkwood.</p>

			<p>Barack Obama is very dangerous. I don&rsquo;t understand how all these white people can be so naive. Don&rsquo;t they find it even a bit odd that 90% of blacks are voting for him (which I fully expected)? They obviously expect a lot from him (e.g., more welfare, the freedom to cause as much trouble as they want with no consequences, etc.). If he wins, I don&rsquo;t know that there will be rioting - perhaps. But if he loses, there definitely will be unprecendented violence, especially if it&rsquo;s close. White people need to be prepared. Due to his background, I also don&rsquo;t trust him with the war on terror - I am not convinced he is on our side. </p>

They were not brought here to co-exist, or to govern us, but merely to serve us. Thank you, Massa Abraham. You and your northern army sowed the seeds of America&rsquo;s eventual destruction. </p>

			<p>Southern Lady:</p>
<p>Segregation wasn&rsquo;t truly sane. It was a jerryrigged fix by the South for their shattered social system. And it was only possible to *maintain* the system as long as the rest of the nation turned a blind eye. Remember what happened after the newspapers and TV crews began showing protests being broken up with dogs and hoses? The rest of the country got involved and from there it was a losing battle.</p>
<p>Segregation shouldn&rsquo;t have happened because slavery never should have happened. Slaves were imported cheap labor for rich whites that couldn&rsquo;t leave their jobs or complain. Not only did that hurt the lower classes of whites, but when the North decided to free the slaves half the nation was wrecked in the process. We&rsquo;re still paying the price. And now our enforced labor (transferred tax $) supports blacks! How&rsquo;s that for irony?<br>

			<p>Its only a matter of time before good white people form an &#8220;Al Qaida&#8221; type mindset and let God rule their hearts and actions.  I see it coming and welcome it.</p>
