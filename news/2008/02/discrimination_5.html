						<p>Crude historical depictions of African Americans as ape-like may have disappeared from mainstream U.S. culture, but research presented in a new paper by psychologists at Stanford, Pennsylvania State University and the University of California-Berkeley reveals that many Americans subconsciously associate blacks with apes.</p>
<p>In addition, the findings show that society is more likely to condone violence against black criminal suspects as a result of its broader inability to accept African Americans as fully human, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>Co-author Jennifer Eberhardt, a Stanford associate professor of psychology who is black, said she was shocked by the results, particularly since they involved subjects born after Jim Crow and the civil rights movement. {snip}</p>
<p>The paper, &#8220;Not Yet Human: Implicit Knowledge, Historical Dehumanization and Contemporary Consequences,&#8221; is the result of a series of six previously unpublished studies conducted by Eberhardt, Pennsylvania State University psychologist Phillip Atiba Goff (the lead author and a former student of Eberhardt&rsquo;s) and Matthew C. Jackson and Melissa J. Williams, graduate students at Penn State and Berkeley, respectively. The paper is scheduled to appear Feb. 7 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, which is published by the American Psychological Association.</p>
<p>The research took place over six years at Stanford and Penn State under Eberhardt&rsquo;s supervision. It involved mostly white male undergraduates. In a series of studies that subliminally flashed black or white male faces on a screen for a fraction of a second to &#8220;prime&#8221; the students, researchers found subjects could identify blurry ape drawings much faster after they were primed with black faces than with white faces.</p>
<p>The researchers consistently discovered a black-ape association even if the young adults said they knew nothing about its historical connotations. The connection was made only with African American faces; the paper&rsquo;s third study failed to find an ape association with other non-white groups, such as Asians. Despite such race-specific findings, the researchers stressed that dehumanization and animal imagery have been used for centuries to justify violence against many oppressed groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Historical background</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although such grotesque characterizations of African Americans have largely disappeared from mainstream U.S. society, Eberhardt noted that science education could be partly responsible for reinforcing the view that blacks are less evolved than whites. An iconic 1970 illustration, &#8220;March of Progress,&#8221; published in the Time-Life book Early Man, depicts evolution beginning with a chimpanzee and ending with a white man. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a legacy of our past that the endpoint of evolution is a white man,&#8221; Eberhardt said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s intentional, but when people learn about human evolution, they walk away with a notion that people of African descent are closer to apes than people of European descent. When people think of a civilized person, a white man comes to mind.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Consequences of socially endorsed violence</b></p>
<p>In the paper&rsquo;s fifth study, the researchers subliminally primed 115 white male undergraduates with words associated with either apes (such as &#8220;monkey,&#8221; &#8220;chimp,&#8221; &#8220;gorilla&#8221;) or big cats (such as &#8220;lion,&#8221; &#8220;tiger,&#8221; &#8220;panther&#8221;). The latter was used as a control because both images are associated with violence and Africa, Eberhardt said. The subjects then watched a two-minute video clip, similar to the television program COPS, depicting several police officers violently beating a man of undetermined race. A mugshot of either a white or a black man was shown at the beginning of the clip to indicate who was being beaten, with a description conveying that, although described by his family as &#8220;a loving husband and father,&#8221; the suspect had a serious criminal record and may have been high on drugs at the time of his arrest.</p>
<p>The students were then asked to rate how justified the beating was. Participants who believed the suspect was white were no more likely to condone the beating when they were primed with either ape or big cat words, Eberhardt said. But those who thought the suspect was black were more likely to justify the beating if they had been primed with ape words than with big cat words. &#8220;Taken together, this suggests that implicit knowledge of a Black-ape association led to marked differences in participants&rsquo; judgments of Black criminal suspects,&#8221; the researchers write.</p>
<p>According to the paper&rsquo;s authors, this link has devastating consequences for African Americans because it &#8220;alters visual perception and attention, and it increases endorsement of violence against black suspects.&#8221; For example, the paper&rsquo;s sixth study showed that in hundreds of news stories from 1979 to 1999 in the Philadelphia Inquirer, African Americans convicted of capital crimes were about four times more likely than whites convicted of capital crimes to be described with ape-relevant language, such as &#8220;barbaric,&#8221; &#8220;beast,&#8221; &#8220;brute,&#8221; &#8220;savage&#8221; and &#8220;wild.&#8221; &#8220;Those who are implicitly portrayed as more ape-like in these articles are more likely to be executed by the state than those who are not,&#8221; the researchers write.</p>

			<p>&#8216;When you look at me, you don&rsquo;t see a man; you see a black man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is a line from a movie and I must say it&rsquo;s true from my upbring. When I am talking about a black person in the third person to a black or a white, more so than not; I say, &#8216;this black guy&hellip;&rsquo; or &#8216;this black lady&hellip;&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t do that as much when I&rsquo;m talking about whites. I think the subject matter and associations usually denote that I&rsquo;m talking about a white person. It&rsquo;s second nature. That&rsquo;s just me.</p>

I didn&rsquo;t see any stories from the 70&rsquo;s that showed liberal Whites and Blacks offended when Muhammad Ali said of Joe Frazier &hellip;..&#8221;When I get the gorilla in Manila&hellip;.&#8221;  Hmmm&hellip;. I guess only Whites are to be condemned when making the association.  By the way, Joe Frazier was a real class act.  Ali wasn&rsquo;t.  (Ali even brought a toy gorilla doll to puncuate his point&hellip;.with the uncivil act of punching it several times.</p>

<p>So what animals do whites represent to blacks. It must be something to justify the staggering amount of black on white violence that dwarves white on black violence. Oh wait, white murder victims are not an &#8216;oppressed group&rsquo; (&#8216;oppressed&rsquo; = Marxist approved).  <br>

			<p>If they&rsquo;d at least dress like human beings, it might help. Not much, but some.  Where I work, most of the young blacks dress like clowns, baggy pants, etc. It&rsquo;s not conducive to being taken seriously.  </p>
<p>Learning to speak standard English would also help. </p>
<p>None of that is going to happen, of course.</p>

<p>Duh?  It just couldn&rsquo;t be their mentality, their race-based predisposition to crime, violence, rape. Their utterly primitive mentality, now could it?</p>
<p>Or their predisposition to destroy and vandalize everything they come in contact with? Attested to that utterly brainless tendency to spray-paint ridiculous grafitti on every wall. The mindless destruction of the inner cities.</p>

			<p>Everything has its reason. If blacks were as productive, honest, and self-restrained as whites are then there would be no racial prejudice against them. Four decades passed since the federal government launch the war on racism and look what happened: America became weaker, poorer, less attractive (relative to other countries), and is more and more resembling an African nation.<br>

			<p>Another blame-whitey propagandist putting out a bogus &#8220;study&#8221; which the credulous media eagerly and uncritically gobbles up. A perfect example of how &#8220;science&#8221; has been subverted to push hate against whites. (Just as science was similarly corrupted in Nazi Germany in its portrayals of Jews.) Whites are ALWAYS to blame. It&rsquo;s NEVER something BLACKS might be doing.<br>
1.) Blacks aren&rsquo;t discriminated against in the U.S., they are given a WHOLE HOST of PREFERENCES. It is whites and Asians who are discriminated against.<br>
2.) There is only one exception to 1 above: The extra caution EVERYONE (including this sham &#8220;researcher&#8221;) takes in the presence of blacks.  But that wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the WILDLY DISPROPORTIONATE amount of crime and violence committed by blacks now would it? (How many of those eating up this report live in a mostly black neighborhood?) Once again, WHITES are the victims of violence at the hands of blacks (over one million each year, 12 times the reverse), but in this bizarro world it is WHITES who are portrayed as the villains and blacks their innocent victims.<br>
3.) It is none other than AFROCENTRISTS who keep on claiming that blacks are the &#8220;Original Man&#8221;, that all other races evolved from, playing right into the hands of those who think of blacks as a more primitive human form. (Actually, the closest living relative of the common ancestor of all mankind is the Bushmen, the indigenous inhabitants of most of sub-Sahara Africa who were mostly exterminated by blacks who pushed them off their original lands.)<br>
4.) People do react to the prevalent behaviors (in a statistical sense) of blacks. But notice that no &#8220;researcher&#8221; presents any evidence that those perceptions are baseless. For instance, that blacks commit no more crime than other races.<br>

<p>This statement alone from the &#8220;study&#8221; shows how contorted this &#8220;researcher&rsquo;s&#8221; mind is! It is the BLACK CRIMINALS who have actually COMMITTED REAL violence. But his concern is not that, but that society (the REAL victims) might condone violence in self defense. And this is a sign that SOCIETY is the problem! And &#8220;racist&#8221;! Not the BLACK CRIMINALS ACTUALLY COMMITTING VIOLENCE!<br>
The depths of stupidity are unfathomable.</p>

			<p>i had to remove myself from the computer for a good 20min after reading this to exercise all of the pent up laughter that was building inside of me as i read and digested this article. i sometimes wonder if we (racially aware whites) upon our racial awakening enter into some sort of alternate reality of enlightenment which permits us to see so clearly what others (guilted white world) are forbidden to aknowledge.</p>
<p>one of the prime gradient measurements to showcase a people&rsquo;s level of civil advancement is to assay the numbering of criminal statistics. thankfully we can have the crime books opened to us and have their association with racial identifiers.</p>
<p>anyone and everyone can see for themselves over the internet the brutal stark racial truth: the darker the racial demographic of a populous the higher the crime rate. the whiter the racial demographic of a populous the lower the crime rate. it is as certain as a barometer gauge observation. there are no exceptions to this whatsoever, this profound truth of race is completely transparent across all economic strata. </p>
<p>it is this vast crime rate racial divide which in my view above any other measurement which separates the white race from the black race. the resultant conclusion speaks to the racially aware whites: &#8216;your racial civilization is superior&rsquo; </p>
<p>to the guilted white world and the multi-culti-diversity rulership the call goes out to the excuse artists to once again bring out the white hating shaman and beat the whiteman pinata while shaking the 2 baby rattles of &#8216;RACISM&rsquo; and &#8216;RACIST&rsquo; hoping somehow to exorcise the evil spirit of &#8216;WHITE SUPREMICISM&rsquo; and &#8216;WHITE RACISM&rsquo; the results of which create a brain-fog of denial and remind the guilted-white world that they are to carry their white-guilt to their grave. </p>

			<p>The fact that this is taxpayer/government funded itself is cause for concern. The entire &#8216;study&rsquo; is a circular excercize in total nonsense. There is no proper foundation. The fact that Whites associate blacks with crime is exactly what a sane, cogent socitey comes to realise.  </p>

<p>Good point! Me, I think the ENTIRE research is worthless. Because the axion: &#8220;By their actions shall you judge them&#8221; is really what we generally base our opinions of Blacks on. Granted, there are many exceptions, but the general picture of Blacks is one of unintelligent, criminalistic, less than human creatures. (Their actions, mannerisms, mentality, innate savagery.)</p>
<p>Of course, in all fairness, they have an excellent excuse: Nearly a century and a half of slavery, another century of post-slavery discriminination. Yeah, right!</p>
<p>In 3008, if there still are humans on this planet, Blacks will still rape, rob, mug, steal, loot, vandalize and destroy at the slightest opportunity or pretext. Blaming their actions on the adverse psychological effect of slavery or post-slavery discrimination.</p>
<p>Ditto for the calendar year 4008, even 5008. Any questions? If so, kindly review the history of native Africans   &mdash;   from their initial appearance in Africa, to the time Whites started their exploration and colonization efforts. Or consider the bottomless morass of crime, corruption, brutality and hell existing in today&rsquo;s &#8220;modern&#8221; African nations.</p>

			<p>WaitNow,</p>
<p>Years ago, the Marx brothers dressed in the big clothes and people laughed at them. That was the idea. To get people to laugh at such clothing and their antics. They were comedians doing their act. When they left the studio, theater, etc. they wore normal attire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my thought that the reason blacks wear these fools clothes is that they&rsquo;re completely without hope and are desparate for any type of attention, even negative attention. Otherwise, they&rsquo;d go for long periods of time without anybody even noticing their existance. The same goes for their committing crimes. If it wasn&rsquo;t for their criminal activities, once again, nobody would give them a second thought.</p>
<p>They are completely outside the main flow of normal everyday activity, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>

			<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>When I see a human being, I see a Caucasian or Asian person who is able to behave.  When I see a black, the old, perhaps ficticious images of animals do not apply.  Animals, except for cats are relatively innocent, and do not deliberately ruin the lives of other animals, just for fun.  With the exception of the Nazis, Communists, and Imperialist Japanese, neither have civilized whites or northeast Asians.</p>
<p>Even the Japanese, who were so cruel during World War Two were kind to their Russian prisoners during the 1904-05 war and their German prisoners during World War One.  The Russian enlisted men did not want to leave, and many of the Germans actually stayed.</p>
<p>The Wichita massacre and Knoxville Horror were not perpetrated by Nazis, Communists or Japanese Imperialists.  </p>

			<p>This was done by a black researcher, need I say more? She won&rsquo;t go the extra mile of finding out why really we don&rsquo;t see blacks as quite on par with whites and e. asians. Blacks don&rsquo;t want to know the entire truth. They just want to know that whites have issues with them and play the guilt blame game to worm out more goodies from them.

<p>Mr. Scott I suggest you read up on your history.  There have been many many other cases, besides the ones you mentioned, where whites and East Asians have been unnecessarily cruel to others and their own.  One extreme example would be the Mongols.  Antisemitic cruelty in Germany did not start with the Nazis.  The Russians also have a long history of large scale, brutal pogroms against Jews.  Notably Chmielnitsky (I&rsquo;m not sure if I spelled that right).  The same can be said of the Poles and certainly the Spanish.  Few nations can honestly claim that they&rsquo;ve avoided unnecessary cruelty throughout their history and that is one reason why white nationalists should focus on the present and the recent past (the last 40 years or so).  Having said that I&rsquo;ll be the first to point out that, had the non-white (and non-Asian) races possessed the same technology as whites, they would have exterminated everybody else long ago without a trace of mercy.  We live in the present but a good knowledge of the past can help us avoid embarrassing ourselves by making claims that are not accurate.<br>

<p>Good post, as always.</p>
<p>Tom Sowell writes that when blacks are faced with a situation in which they cannot possibly compete (such as receiving un-earned, un-qualified preferences into a university in which they cannot possibly succeed) they do one of two things: drop out or scream &#8216;RACISM.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The screams of &#8216;racism&rsquo; naturally led to demands (with implied threats of violence if their demands are not met) that the universities create &#8216;black studies&rsquo; depts.  &mdash;  leading other non-Whites(and feminists) to demand their own departments (Chicano studies, Women&rsquo;s studies, Social Justice studies, etc.).</p>
<p>Steve Sailer calls this anti-White hate studies, with good reason.</p>
<p>Would you hire anyone in your business whose major was black or chicano studies?</p>

<p>This is what is so scary about Third World hell-holes coming into possession of CBN weaponry on the black market  &mdash;  (CBN= Chemical, biological and nuclear)  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll hesitate for one second to use this technology on their enemies the first chance they get (without mercy as you pointed out)  &mdash;  including the US.</p>
<p>This is why it is imperative that we stop meddling in the affairs of other countries and withdraw immediately from the Middle East.  John McCain is OK with the US remaining there for the next 100 years  &mdash;  and that I should willingly, happily sacrifice my children and grandchildren into the endless &#8216;tar pit.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>&lsquo;When you look at me, you don&rsquo;t see a man; you see a black man.&rsquo;<br>
It should read, &#8220;When you look at me, you should see a black man&#8221;  &mdash;  my reference is The Color of Crime here.  Being aware of one&rsquo;s surrounding is essential to personal survival.</p>
<p>Blacks are clearly the least civilized large racial group.  That is a fact, not the musings of a anti-black racist.  The proof is in history and all around you.</p>
<p>As far as depictions of blacks as objects of ridicule, where have the authors been for the last 30 years?  I saw a movie last night called The Brave One  &mdash;  the vicious attackers were white; the victim was the Indian physician boyfriend of the white female heroine; the major authority figure, the chief detective, was black and the one truly evil businessman character, the one who imported drugs, was into every kind of illicit activity and the one whom the morally upstanding detective had been trying for 3 years to put behind bars, yes, you guessed it, he was a white male.</p>
<p>If anything, blacks are consistently depicted as the exact opposite of what most are, i.e. as highly educated, morally upstanding, as heroic love interests for white females, etc.  Whites are almost exclusively portrayed in either roles subservient to blacks or as the embodiment of pure evil(especially white males).  Such was the case in the movie referred to above and in most current films.  My suggestion is to skip the movie, as it is not only inaccurate in racial terms but, because it was made by the left wingers in Holliwood, they can&rsquo;t even get the basic facts about guns right.  The vigilante uses a 9mm &#8220;automatic&#8221; pistol  &mdash;  -yet only one round is fired each time she pulls the trigger  &mdash;  -sounds like Dianne Finestein&rsquo;s understanding of &#8220;assault weapon&#8221;.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The research took place over six years at Stanford and Penn State under Eberhardt&rsquo;s supervision. It involved mostly white male undergraduates.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think we need to expand this study and &#8220;involve&#8221; a range of racial and ethnic groups.  Why limit the &#8220;involved&#8221; groups to white, no doubt Christian males.  Isn&rsquo;t the real agenda here to use mostly white tax dollars to funnel grant money to non-whites so they can instill and/or pro-long white guilt?  Maybe if a few of these minority groups would deprive us of their presence in the homeland of our people, our and their problems would evaporate over-night.</p>

<p> I also saw that ridiculous movie and thought the same things too. The way blacks are portrayed in TV and Hollywood has no relation to reality at all. Ever watch those CSI shows? They always seem to have some brilliant black scientist working in the lab. But Whites who have little personal experience with blacks generally tend to accept what they see on the movie screens.</p>

<p>I like Jodi Foster as an actress and was going to see the film. I appreciate your saving me the ticket price.<br>
What I can&rsquo;t understand is how these Hollywood freaks can keep doing this. Even they know what a Chimera it all is.  They know that the fools will keep ponying up the cash to see these films whether it be in the theaters or on DVD.<br>
Do they take comfort in the fantasy that Blacks are really all very nice and loving people and that none of them wishes us harm?</p>

			<p>This is not a scientific study, it uses subjective starting points to arrive at subjective conclusions.  </p>
<p>But the general image of the black as a dangerous presence is being fought incredibly hard through the MSM.  Everytime I switch on a popular cop program, CSI or Criminal Minds, or whatever they are, I seem to see extravagant story lines concerning insanely criminal whites, engaging in highly corrupt cimes.  Even &#8220;24&#8221; which I do not watch religiously had a black president while the hero&rsquo;s own white family was involved in selling nuclear weapons to terrorists, who set one off in L.A.  The relationships between the female staff and the black president are emotional, approaching a sexual tone.  But no matter how much the media works at reversing reality and brainwashing the public, even the 10:00 O&rsquo;Clock News has a hard time surpressing the black and hispanic threat that lurks almost everywhere.</p>

<p>Because from a percentage stand-point blacks commit far more violent crime and murder than any other racial group. Could well-deserved Just Punishment be the reason for the higher number of black executions?</p>
<p>From that old stand-by, The Color of Crime:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder, and eight times more likely to commit robbery&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://64.233.167.104/custom?q=cache:SBTXU843cgsJ:www.amren.com/colorofcrime/color.pdf+Black+on+White+crime&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us&amp;client=google-coop" rel="nofollow">http://64.233.167.104/custom?q=cache:SBTXU843cgsJ:www.amren.com/colorofcrime/color.pdf+Black+on+White+crime&hl;=en&ct;=clnk&cd;=1&gl;=us&client;=google-coop</a></p>
<p><br>
From the Washington Times:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.the majority of violent crime across racial lines are committed by blacks against whites, the study finds. Black-on-white crimes were almost nine times as frequent as white-on-black crimes, the study reports&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>And this, the reason so much violent, vicious black on white (or ANY black crime for that matter) crimes are unknown:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;It&rsquo;s an issue that most white scholars ignore, because you can only get in trouble,&rsquo; said Morgan Reynolds, director of the Criminal Justice Center at the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis. It is well known&hellip;&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rsquo;Put in the most easily understood terms, the average black was &hellip; 56 times more likely to commit criminal violence against a white than was a white to commit criminal violence against a black,&rsquo; the study said&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="/inthenews/hatecrimes.html" rel="nofollow">/inthenews/hatecrimes.htm</a></p>

<p>Even those utterly absurd TV commericals show the average White family with the obligatory Best Friend(s) who happen to be Black. With, of cuss, the Blacks portrayed as so much smarter than the Whites, generally portrayed as chumps!</p>
<p>In REAL LIFE, how many White families generally are as palsy-walsy with Blacks as those inane commercials would have us believe? In real life, at the end of the working day, Blacks and Whites go in separate directions to their own lives. Rarely, if ever, are those ludicruous commericals reflective of reality. But the same applies to the equally stupid TV sitcoms and movies.</p>
<p>Worth commenting on: So MANY Blacks in those nutty films and even nuttier commericals are LIGHT SKINNED! Pushing the no-so-subtle propaganda at impressionable youngsters that interracial sex is the NORM! Think about it.</p>

<p>This is false. Scientists hold personal biases at times, but data don&rsquo;t lie. There are no subjective starting points in the experiments as the conclusions are derived from results &mdash; the experiments and hypotheses are themselves starting points. In fact, the authors&rsquo; reactions to the results indicate their hypothesis was weakened.</p>
<p>What the authors do is try to explain their data using historical and sociological backdrops. Regardless of their explanations, <b>the dehumanization of blacks is clearly evident from the report.</b> The cause of this dehumanization is a different issue altogether. Is it because whites think they are superior; is it because blacks commit more crimes relative to their population numbers, is it because blacks are poor, etc. ? It&rsquo;s always good to be a critical but fair-minded reader. </p>

Jodie Foster&rsquo;s character, very much like Charles Bronson&rsquo;s in &#8220;Death Wish,&#8221; was trying to avenge something taken from her permanently.  And two of the people who accosted and terrorized her   &mdash;   remember the subway scene?   &mdash;   were black.  And she shot them.  (Good for her.)</p>
<p>Enough, already, of this anti-Hollywood nonsense.  One film, even an objectionable one, does not an entire industry make.  And the film was not   &mdash;   I repeat, not   &mdash;   anti-white.  That&rsquo;s why I recommend it to any patriot.</p>

<p>I really have to say that my ancestors, each and every one, arrived in the USA as dirt poor Europeans. ANY black at the time was better off. I am their still poor descendant, as were my parents and grandparents. Crime, violence, blaming other folks for our lot were NEVER, EVER a part of our family history or my upbringing. During the 20th century, we have seen ALL the places our family lived in deteriorate due to blacks moving in. Interesting to note that they were preferred in hiring (in order to avoid discrimination lawsuits?),seemed to be better off financiallly and actively discriminated against whites when they were in a position to do so. When they were around, trouble would start, even if they were outnumbered. Always. So, yes, I have some strong opinions about blacks, and they are not nice opinions. As they say, experience is the best teacher.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;Seeker&#8221; is surely entitled to his opinion, of course. But the reality remains Hollywood has been BRAINWASHING Americans for generations. Particularly, impressionable children and young people!</p>
<p>That &#8220;one film does not an indusry make&#8221; notwithstanding, Hollywood still is the world&rsquo;s most powerful PROPAGANDA MACHINE! Putting the best propaganda efforts of totalitarian regimes to shame! A trueism MANY AmRen readers besides myself have noted and commented on. The undeniable message from the Hollywood Propaganda Mill is that interracial mixing is normal, even laudable. A message imparted starting with Kiddie Cartoons, and continued though to the &#8220;top grossing&#8221; films. With Whites invariably portrayed as never as bright, witty or intelligent as Black actors. Or has that escaped the notice of &#8220;seeker&#8221; despite so many of us having picked that up?</p>
<p>Even foreign nationals, viewing typical Hollywood propaganda films converted for their language, still judge America by what they see and perceive in films. A nation so rich, hardly anyone works at real jobs   &mdash;   unless to kill time. Where everyone is filthy rich. Is it any wonder so many millions of foreigners would sell their mothers for the opportunity to come here. THINK IT OVER, friends! The epitaph for America   &mdash;   &#8220;Here lies American culture. The victim of Hollywood Propaganda.&#8221;</p>

He has personal flaws, but in the last episode of last season, he got revenge on a crooked Bantu cop on the force, by locking the guy up in a cage in the Everglades swamps. His girlfriend, who was a pyromaniac, lights a match and turns on a propane tank blowing up the Bantu crooked cop to pieces.</p>
