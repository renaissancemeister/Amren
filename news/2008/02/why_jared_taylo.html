<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Early in February, the Michigan State University chapter of the Young Americans for Freedom (MSU-YAF) announced it had invited Jared Taylor to speak on campus about how diversity and multi-culturalism threaten our society. Mr. Taylor would hardly have been the first controversial speaker MSU-YAF has hosted. In the last year and a half, we have sponsored talks by Congressman Tom Tancredo (a declared presidential candidate at the time), Chris Simcox of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, and Nick Griffin of the British National Party, as well as many others.</p>
<p>I have been forced to withdraw Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s invitation because of a combination of factors that have resulted in a serious abridgement of free speech at MSU.</p>
<p>First, the National Young Americans for Freedom, which serves as the umbrella organization for all campus YAF chapters, threatened to revoke our YAF charter if the talk went forward. Chairman Erik Johnson&rsquo;s excuse was that YAF does not officially recognize multi-culturalism as a threat to the United States. He cited as his authority something called the Sharon Statement, a YAF founding document, according to which &#8220;the forces of international Communism are, at present, the greatest single threat to these [American] liberties.&#8221; Congressman Tancredo, Chris Simcox, and Mr. Krikorian were somehow forgiven for failing to work this theme into their comments, but Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s talk would have been off limits because multi-culturalism is not covered by the Sharon Statement. Despite the incoherence of its position, National YAF was adamant: We were not to host Mr. Taylor. If we defied National YAF and sponsored the talk anyway, we would have lost our YAF charter and would no longer have been an official student organization with the right to host events on campus.</p>
<p>The university, run by the usual fanatical advocates of diversity, also threw obstacles in our path. We had scheduled Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s talk for Wednesday, March 19. Suddenly, the university told us that date was impossible. It had been understood from the beginning that the talk would require police security, and the university claimed security would be possible at only one lecture hall &mdash; and that hall had become mysteriously unavailable that day.</p>
<p>La Raza and MEChA can have events any day. They can also hold them anywhere because their opponents are civilized and pose no threat that requires police protection. Conservative groups, however, are stifled through a combination of strong-arm tactics and bureaucratic harassment.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor may yet come to Lansing, however. I have passed his name on to a local activist who arranges talks in the area, and I understand discussions about a possible lecture have already begun.</p>
<p>The cancellation may well have spared Mr. Taylor a certain amount of unpleasantness. Many of our events have been violently disrupted by left-wing students who have more in common with Hitler&rsquo;s brown shirts than they would care to admit. When Congressman Tom Tancredo spoke at MSU last year, a La Raza activist attacked the seven-months&rsquo; pregnant wife of the Olivet-YAF chairman. Others kicked and spat on me. Protesters pulled the fire alarm twice, and followed us after the event to a restaurant and slashed our car tires while we were inside. All this made national news; the president of the MSU College Republicans and I discussed these outrages on <cite>The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor,</cite> and Mr. Tancredo appeared on <cite>Hannity &amp; Colmes.</cite></p>
<p>When Chris Simcox of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps spoke at MSU, the Aztlan militants were so disruptive that the university police called for reinforcements from the city of Lansing. The police cleared the room of troublemakers, arresting four of the worst, and Mr. Simcox was able to give his talk. Protesters were still outside the building, however, and police had to push them away from the doors as we came out. I overheard one officer suggest to another that they should have brought &#8220;shields and helmets.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Nick Griffin of the British National Party spoke at MSU on how Islam is taking over Europe, protesters beat a piñata that was made to resemble him. They shouted so much during the speech that Mr. Griffin had to end it early. Just as they did when Mr. Tancredo spoke, protesters set off the fire alarm. After the aborted talk, MSU-YAF members had to run for their lives from a lynch mob of protesters armed with sticks and bats. Videos we have uploaded to YouTube.com capture only part of the chaos leftists were able to provoke when Nick Griffin, Tom Tancredo, and Chris Simcox tried to speak.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that if Jared Taylor had spoken at MSU, he would have faced similar opposition and disruption. Various leftists including Students for a Democratic Society were already announcing plans to do everything possible to prevent Mr. Taylor from delivering his talk.</p>
<p>On Thursday, February 21, the student government of Michigan State University approved a bill requesting the university to define the supposed difference between &#8220;hate speech&#8221; and free speech. This craven move resulted directly from the lectures my group has sponsored, and is intended stop speakers the leftists do not like. It is not certain whether the university will establish &#8220;hate speech&#8221; guidelines or how they would be implemented. In a sane world, the student government would be censuring people who violently disrupt meetings, but it instead wants to do the protesters&rsquo; work for them by preventing the meetings in the first place.</p>
<p>What our opponents have done &mdash; and what cowards at the university and in &#8220;conservative&#8221; organizations permit them to do &mdash; could not be a more eloquent expression of the poverty of leftist thinking. Unable to refute our views in civilized debate, incapable of understanding the First Amendment, their brutish tactics reflect their brutish natures. They are the best possible demonstration of the very point Mr. Taylor had intended to make: that multi-culturalism is a serious threat to what is left of Western Civilization on this continent.</p>

					<p>Of course, Jared Taylor at <span class="caps">MSU </span>just wouldn&rsquo;t fit in those traditional campus debates between communists and socialists.</p>
<p>Remember, <span class="caps">YAF </span>was started by Bill Buckley, whose recent passing we&rsquo;re all supposed to mourn.</p>

					<p> What a shame that at the same time that great founder of the American Conservative movement, William F. Buckley Jr., has passed on to his reward, the organization he founded, Young Americans for Freedom, can be so pig-headedly obtuse about the racial problems staring our country in the face. To the extent that the national <span class="caps">YAF </span>contributed to forcing the local <span class="caps">YAF </span>to withdraw the invitation to Jared Taylor, shame on that obtuseness. Any notion that &#8220;communism&#8221; still constitutes the main threat to this country shows a mindset hopelessly mired in the 1960s.</p>
<p> To the extent that the idiotic multicultists at <span class="caps">MSU </span>are also responsible for Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s not being allowed to speak, shame on them, too. But it&rsquo;s what we could expect from them. We rather thought the national <span class="caps">YAF </span>would show better judgment.</p>
<p> I certainly hope that the negotiations for Mr. Taylor to speak at Lansing anyway, and the leftists be damned, will result in those of like minds being allowed to hear him.  </p>

					<p>Im sure we all saw this coming. Free speech? In America? Yeah right. Free speech IF you think correctly.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, the National Young Americans for Freedom, which serves as the umbrella organization for all campus <span class="caps">YAF </span>chapters, threatened to revoke our <span class="caps">YAF </span>charter if the talk went forward. Chairman Erik Johnson&rsquo;s excuse was that <span class="caps">YAF </span>does not officially recognize multi-culturalism as a threat to the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>So führer johnson doesnt recognize one of Mr Taylor&rsquo;s talking points as legitimate, in his opinion? Yeah? So?  It would seem that johnson doesnt recognize many things. For example what free speech is. And that he is infringing on an American&rsquo;s right to exercise that right. </p>
<p>There is little doubt that this mini tyrant probably has a nice warm fuzzy feeling, knowing in his feeble little mind that he did something good here. Im sure he feels that he did his part in helping stamp out bigotry. Mr johnson, you did nothing of the kind. But you did display for all to see, your own brand of bigotry. Our Founders would be ashamed of you. And I too am ashamed of you. </p>

					<p>Ernst Zundel and many others are imprisoned in Europe for saying the wrong things about <span class="caps">WWII, </span>but Black figures in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>can go so far as to call for the extermination of whites while whites cannot even speak about wanting to retain some rights for themselves. Is this just a driverless machine careening along under it&rsquo;s own momentum as it crushes whites and their interests, or is someone driving it? Who said what to the national head of <span class="caps">YAF, </span>and why? </p>
<p>National <span class="caps">YAF&rsquo;</span>s failure to even uphold the principle of free speech (and moderate free speech, at that) indicates that something very intense is going on.</p>
<p>And what investigative journalist will interview the head of the national <span class="caps">YAF </span>to try to find out who pressured him, and then interview those people who pressured him to find out who in turn pressured them, etc. Not any, I&rsquo;ll wager. What newspaper would publish such a journalist&rsquo;s story, anyway? Not any, I&rsquo;ll wager.</p>

					<p>&#8220;&hellip;the Sharon Statement, a <span class="caps">YAF </span>founding document, according to which &ldquo;the forces of international Communism are, at present, the greatest single threat to these [American] liberties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Replace &#8216;Communism&rsquo; with &#8216;Multiculturalism&rsquo; in this stupid statement and <span class="caps">YAF </span>might become relavent in the year 2008. </p>
<p>Multiculturalism is communism where the focus has been shifted from class to race. America is transforming into a third world nation and <span class="caps">YAF </span>is still fighting the Cold War? <span class="caps">YAF </span>must be run by idiots. We criticize blacks for eternally marching on Selma but are white &#8216;conservatives&rsquo; any better?</p>

					<p>The crazies prove for us what we say is true when they run hysterically amuk, pulling out all stops to silence our message.  They know full-well that their ideas are whacky and could never persuade anybody but the mentally and emotionally disturbed when held up to the light of day by the realism of race.</p>
<p>In order to prevail, they must keep a constant lid on the truth, while they maintain a constant bombardment of propaganda, which they&rsquo;re finding is pretty hard to do. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to be able to shake them up so badly they take to panicking like rats scurrying everywhere in fear of going down with the ship.  And that&rsquo;s exactly what is going to happen&hellip;&hellip;.sooner or later.  They&rsquo;re doing all they can right now to fight a holding action.  The charade can&rsquo;t last forever. </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed a current theme in <span class="caps">AMREN </span>about how to defend ourself against the leftist bozos who always curtail our free speech because it disagrees with them.<br>
We always talk about being diciplined, contacting the authorities, and suing if necessary.  I agree that this is the proper response with civilized people.  This article demonstrates how being polite and nice and expecting to get a fair shake will not be successful in certain instances.  Please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but do you actually see this working?</p>
<p>At the recent <span class="caps">AMREN </span>conference the protesters shouted, spit, and invaded the rights of peaceful people.  Not one thing was done as usual. And people were asking where  the police  where to arrest the spitters and the violators of free speech. Come on people, wake up.</p>
<p>Now the speaking engagement of Mr. Taylor has been cancelled by forces apparently beyond our control. Our entire society is based on the fallacious concept of diversity and multiculturalism.  Nothing will ever happen to people that promote this viewpoint.</p>
<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t demonstrate what we are up against and how much the brainwashing and indoctrination by our media and school have taken hold I don&rsquo;t  know what can.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted our message to be spread peacefully as I believe most whites would agree with it.  However the forces that oppose us have more influence that expected. It appears only change will  take place by a revolution of thought and action.  When has this ever been done by peaceful means?</p>

					<p>I am surprised a <span class="caps">YAF </span>chapter was allowed to invite any Conservative speaker more controversial than George Will or Michael Medved.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s be honest, a great, honest man on our side like Jared Taylor would not get published or covered by National Review after the purges of Brimelow and <span class="caps">O&rsquo;S</span>ullivan.</p>
<p>Mainstream American Ccnservatism, establishment Republicans&hellip;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a shame that at the same time that great founder of the American Conservative movement, William F. Buckley Jr., has passed on to his reward&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You must be a reader of old english heroic literature.  I enjoyed that &#8220;passed on to his reward&#8221; allusion.</p>
<p>Luckily, I hear Mr. Taylor will be speaking at another college in another state.  Freedom marches on!</p>

					<p>The United States of America contrary to what some believe is <span class="caps">NOT </span>a free country where freedom of speech is the reality.</p>
<p>Much like any banana republic or communist state, the press is controlled, speech is controlled, what you think is being imposed by the usual brain washing and cult tactics.</p>
<p>And it is only going to get worse.</p>
<p>The fact that some groups can speak out and with full police protection while others cannot is demonstrable proof of a double standard and corruption by government.</p>
<p>And you think this is a democratic country and you have freedom.</p>
<p>I am laughing as I ponder the mindstate of the fools in this fools paradise.</p>

					<p>Now we know who the real opponents of free speech are. As soon as the leftists get their own free speech platform, then free speech for everyone else has to end. These barbarous actions of pulling a fire alarm (which is intended for everyone&rsquo;s safety) hitting, spitting, and slashing tires would bring national headlines if they were committed by the right instead of the left. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, but I also don&rsquo;t recall seeing anything banning &#8220;hate speech&#8221; in the Bill of Rights. There isn&rsquo;t anything because no one can crawl inside another&rsquo;s head and determine whether speech is motivated by &#8220;hate&#8221; or simply a genuine concern for reality. We all know this attempt to ban &#8220;hate speech&#8221; is simply an attempt to ban free speech that someone else doesn&rsquo;t like.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m disgusted and disheartened by <span class="caps">YAF&rsquo;</span>s reaction  &mdash;  and even more so by this &#8216;university&rsquo; which is obviously neither a bastion of free ideas nor an example of First Amendment Rights (which it should be)  &mdash;  despite what the so-called president has stated in her President&rsquo;s Message:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;we have an individual and shared responsibility to guard against behaviors that demean or otherwise harm individuals and our community. A strong campus community is characterized by respect for, and civility toward, one another&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.president.msu.edu/message_092106.php</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;We must,&rsquo; states President Simon, &#8216;collectively deny inappropriate behavior in all forms in order to protect the rights we all hold dear.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Also from the First Amendment-loving (HA!) President:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Fundamental to Michigan State University&rsquo;s philosophy on campus dissent is a belief that the rights guaranteed in the First and Fourteenth amendments of the Constitution must be protected&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like the idiot president to explain to us why the following was allowed to happen under her watch and what she did about it (and why there is an on-going threat of the same violence happening again):  </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;at <span class="caps">MSU </span>last year, a La Raza activist attacked the seven-months&rsquo; pregnant wife of the Olivet-YAF chairman. Others kicked and spat on me. Protesters pulled the fire alarm twice, and followed us after the event to a restaurant and slashed our car tires while we were inside&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="caps">MSU </span>is a disgrace. <span class="caps">MSU&rsquo;</span>s president is a disgrace.  <span class="caps">YAF </span>is a disgrace.</p>

					<p>Part of the reason that Mr. Taylor must be prevented from speaking is that, from the debates I have heard on the AmRen website, Mr Taylor cleans their clock when it comes to logical argument. </p>
<p>In one debate, a Mr. Gitierrez was reduced to angry rantings against Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s even, polite, quite tones. You could hear a pin drop when Mr Taylor said, &#8220;The word Nation comes from the latin &#8220;natio&#8221; to be born.&#8221; </p>
<p>A Leftist is essentially unarmed against a resonably intelligent person, because he essentially wants to steal your goods to give to himself and others to make himself feel better. This defies basic logic and morality and frankly, is childish in the extreme. Against a well spoken and intelligent man such as Mr. Taylor, they can only shout slogans and push him out of the room, for to debate him is to lose publicly.</p>

					<p>Do you have to get approval for your speakers?  Why not surprise the kids and the white-hating faculty with a &ldquo;Surprise Guest Speaker&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Try this:<br>
This spring we will get a fresh look at the dialectic of racism that has plagued America throughout her history.  Our surprise great speaker is a world renowned and respected authority on the evils of racism, especial in 20th century America.  He will lecture on &ldquo;Benefits of Diversity from a Marxian Perspective&rdquo;.  The acclaimed scholar will offer a new and challenging direction to racial harmony.  </p>
<p>Sounds pretty harmless.<br>
Of course the evils of racism are brought on solely by forced race mixing.  The benefits of diversity turn out to harm everyone because of their dishonesty.  This obvious fact even Marx would see were he alive today, (which couldn&rsquo;t happen because some crazy anti-free speech Fascist at <span class="caps">MSU </span>would have shot him dead).     The new direction to racial harmony?  Freedom to associate and not associate with whomever you choose.<br><br>
 <br><br>
If you must get permission by naming the speaker, why not J A W Taylor.  I&rsquo;m sure that Jared has some middle names.  And charge admission, $20.00 to faculty and non students, $10.00 to those you don&rsquo;t&rsquo; like the looks of, and free passes to our boys.<br><br>

<p>Young America&rsquo;s Foundation is separate from Young Americans for Freedom.  The former&rsquo;s website is yaf.org while the latter&rsquo;s website is yaf.com.

					<p>Perhaps we need our own Long March through the universities, using any means to wreck the careers of leftist academics while infiltrating those institutions with our own, by stealth if necessary. There&rsquo;s something charming about holding public meetings   &mdash;   that naive faith in The Marketplace of Ideas and Gentlemanly Discourse   &mdash;   but as the present totalitarian climate makes this difficult or impossible, more covert approaches may be called for. After all, if the Left had confined itself to Hyde-Park-style public speeches, they wouldn&rsquo;t have got anywhere. It was the constant pressure of subversion that turned the universities over to them.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Chairman Erik Johnson&rsquo;s excuse was that <span class="caps">YAF </span>does not officially recognize multi-culturalism as a threat to the United States. He cited as his authority something called the Sharon Statement, a <span class="caps">YAF </span>founding document, according to which &ldquo;the forces of international Communism are, at present, the greatest single threat to these [American] liberties.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Mr. Johnson is an idiot.  Does he not realize that multi-culturalism IS a force of international communism?</p>
<p>Mr. Bristow&rsquo;s description of what the Aztlan hooligans did to disrupt Chris Simcox&rsquo;s talk at <span class="caps">MSU </span>was disturbing.  It is becoming clear that these matters will not ultimately be solved by giving speeches, but only by giving in kind.</p>

<p>We can be 100% certain that the Nation of Islam, New Black Panther Party, <span class="caps">MECHA </span>and <span class="caps">CAIR </span>will not be impacted by this &#8220;definition of hate speech.&#8221;</p>

<p>I agree with you 100 % Bernie, but the key word is &#8216;impacted&rsquo;. On occasion these groups find themselves held back too. 3 out of 4 of them are on hate-group lists. I could even imagine a day when there is talk of banning these groups on campus (as a last ditch effort to ban white groups there). These are just recent day show moves, however, perhaps to trick the gullible into thinking there&rsquo;s a bottom line fairness going on. The reality is, the agenda of none-white groups is paid for and promoted. There is no white agenda. Even the other day Barack Obama was &#8216;denouncing&rsquo; the endorsement of the Nation of Islam, while almost every black child born in America will be given a name along the lines of Shamiqua.</p>
<p>These groups won&rsquo;t be seriously impacted by &#8216;hate speech&rsquo; legislation, both because the modern day curriculum itself, is hate speech against whites, and because the agenda of the Nation of Islam, New Black Panther Party, Mecha, Chair, La Raza, Bam and Sfds&hellip; their agenda&hellip; is the agenda of <span class="caps">MSU. </span></p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be more clear where these policy initiatives, teacher sensibilities, and curriculum changes at University have come from over the last 40 years - And from where these young students have learned to use violence or hate, and the perpetual looming threat of violence, to get other, (less conscious) young citizens, to see things their way, to get what they want, no matter the consequences. <br>

<p>Freedom of speech may be the most important idea produced by Western civilization, and we Americans can be especially proud that its institutionalization in our Bill of Rights has afforded us more freedom of speech than exists in any other Western country that I know of. Even now, we may express our freedom about racial matters with much greater freedom than is allowed in Europe or in Canada.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t share the view expressed in the quote you attribute to Lincoln (and it may well be his  &mdash;  he was certainly no great supporter of human freedoms!). If the persons who have denied Jared Taylor his freedom of speech at <span class="caps">MSU </span>wished to assemble peaceably and express their views, including their reasons for preventing us from doing the same, would you wish to deny them that freedom? I hope not! When a freedom is being weakened, the remedy is not to weaken it further! The remedy is to fight for the full restoration of that freedom.<br>
 <br><br>
This point is spoken to well in the play, &#8220;A Man for All Seasons,&#8221; in which William Roper and Sir Thomas More debate: </p>
<p>&#8220;Roper: So now you&rsquo;d give the devil benefit of law.</p>
<p>More: Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the devil?</p>
<p>Roper: I&rsquo;d cut down every law in England to do that.</p>
<p>More: Oh? And when the law was down  &mdash;  and the devil turned round on you  &mdash;  where would you hide? Yes, I&rsquo;d give the devil benefit of law, for my own safety&rsquo;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The far left has ever been ready to discard what they refer to contemptuously as &#8220;the bourgeois freedoms&#8221; of our Bill of Rights, in favor of what they regard as a greater good whose realization might be impeded by those freedoms. We should never fall into the same temptation.</p>
<p>Zundel, and anyone else, should be granted full exercise of free speech, whatever their own views on that principle might be. </p>
<p>(I would be curious, though, to know just what Zundel&rsquo;s views might be on the extreme suppression of free speech under the National Socialists in Germany  &mdash;  thanks for raising that possible interesting contradiction).<br>

So, what I suggest is a &#8220;distributed campus visit.&#8221;  Taylor could give a 30 minute talk on <span class="caps">DVD </span>and <span class="caps">YAF</span>fers and their allies could put on small presentations in dormitory lounges or even dormitory rooms for small groups.
