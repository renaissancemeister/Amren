						<p>I know that you have risked your lives in order to give opportunities to your children, to your families. I know that in each one of you there s a history of heroism and also a history of pain.</p>
<p>A history of heroism because is not easy to leave your country, your house, your Nation and to cross the border risking it all. A history of heroism because each year more than 400 Mexicans die trying to cross the border, perhaps more than in any another part of the world.</p>
<p>______</p>
<p>When they tell me that the Government of Mexico what wants to multiply migration, attacking and criticizing our defense for the migrant, I say that they are mistaken. Because I know that Mexico in each migrant it loses its bravest people, its strongest people, its more audacious people, because I know that in each migrant there is a family that is disconnected.</p>
<p> ______</p>
<p>I come here, to Chicago, to Illinois, because I know that my duty as President, especially in the difficult moments that the undocumented are passing, of harassment, of clear discrimination in some cases, my duty is to echo the voice of all the Mexicans, the voice of all of Mexico telling them we are with you.</p>
<p>We are truly determined that Mexico be present with you, supporting you, helping you, understanding you.</p>
<p>I also know, my friends, that my duty as the President is to work and to work very, very hard so that immigration will not be in the future the only option for our people.</p>
<p> _______</p>
<p>When they ask me what is, exactly, the cause of this phenomenon, seems to me to that we cannot deceive ourselves. The U.S. economy and the economy of Mexico are absolutely complementary economies; one is intensive in capital, like their economy, another is intensive in labor as is the Mexican and I have always said that labor and capital necessarily are complemented, that they are similar as the left shoe and the right shoe, both have to be put on at the same time in order to walk.</p>
<p>And just as labor has sought capital, the investment here in the United States, we are seeking to attract investment and capital to Mexico, to generate in Mexico well paid jobs for the Mexicans so they don&rsquo;t continue separating our families and our communities.</p>
<p> ________</p>
<p>We have worked and we have been speaking and relating to diverse actors in the political panorama in Mexico and in the United States, above all with those who have influences in this migratory debate issue and we have expressed to them with firmness the position of the Government of Mexico that can be summarize in five points.</p>
<p>First. We want that the extraordinary cultural, social, and economic contribution of the Mexican migrants in the United States to be recognized.</p>
<p>Second. We want that that recognition be reflected in a greater certainty, in a greater stability, in a greater tranquility so that our compatriots can do what they came to do, to work in peace, to be productive, support their family and be recognized or not, that their work has also helped this Nation.</p>
<p>Third. That for the Mexican Government it is important, of course, to have a secure border. When they think that we are disputing this point, they are also mistaken, yes, of course I want a secure border, of course I want a secure border for our people, for our children and also for the Americans or any person that live on both sides of the border.</p>
<p>The Government of Mexico is commited and works for having a secure border with the United States, but we should not make a mistake, its not the people, is the organized crime and not the migrant Mexicans the ones that are a problem of national security for the United States.</p>
<p>I think that both nations should recognize what is a reality, the world is being globalized, the economies are being built global and the nations that are prospering, the regions that are prospering, like Asia, and Europe, are nations that recognize that reality and they are capable of being integrated in larger economies of scale and in larger territories.</p>
<p>What we should do Americans and Mexicans is to recognize that if we want prosperity, that if we want to progress we should become united. Not by closing our border, not by canceling our exchanges are we going to prosper, we either prosper together incorporating and integrating or there will not be prosperity neither for Mexico or for the United States.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>We want to build bridges because we know that bridges, more than walls, are the ones that join people. And I also know, I understand the worry of many American citizens, but I can share with you, my friends, what some time ago Icommented to President Bush in his visit to Mexico last year.</p>
<p>I assured the President, I told him, that he can do more to reduce immigration,to reduce immigration it would benefit more a kilometer of highway in Zacatecas or in Michoac√°n than 20 kilometers of border wall covering Texas or Arizona.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>We want to be near the Mexicans in Chicago and anywhere in the world and in the U.S. And we have an idea to continue working with you in five main issues.</p>
<p>First. We will dedicate all the resources at our reach to be able to improve the services that the Government gives. I know that the consular services have always left a lot to be desired and more now since the American authorities are asking for documents for anything.</p>
<p>By that reason, friends, I have decreed in the Budget that all the incomes that be received for passports or other documents in the U.S. consulates, that money remain in the consulates to lend better service.</p>
<p>Second. Starting this week, various mexican consulates in the United States, especially the one in Chicago, will use mobile truck consulates to function with newly hired personnel, with new vehicles, new equipment, so they can vist the 80 cities in the region and offer consular services.</p>
<p>We are going to continue working with those programs and others more. Today, for example, we signed two covenants, one with the State of Illinois and another with the City of Chicago, a covenant to do an exchange of teachers, we are going to bring Mexican teachers here, so they can teach our culture, our traditions and from here we are going to send teachers to Mexico, if you want you could lend us a hand teach English at our communities, to our children that need that Instrument.</p>
<p>Third. We are going to continue working to generate a different environment in the migratory theme; this should remain clear that the Mexicans, that Mexico is not the enemy and Mexicans are not any threat for this great Nation.</p>
<p>That we want to prompt and make recognition of the enormous contributions that the Mexicans do to the U.S. economy. Recent studies have shown, above all one done by the Counsel of Economic Advisors of the White House, they have shown that the immigrant workers, especially the Mexicans, do not displace native workers, to the contrary, they complement the work that they carry out, they enlarge also the income of the American workers. It is calculated that 30 Billion dollars per year, is what the migratory labor force contributes to the income of the U.S. workers.</p>
<p>It also has been shown that the balance that the migrants costs the American taxpayer, this is false thus, this study that is not from the Government of Mexico, is from the Government of the United States and the Counsel of Economic Advisors of the White House, indicates that the balance is a lot more than what the migrants pay in taxes upon working than what they receive in services, and that is so much that they are even maintaining a good part of the retirement pensions of thousands of U.S. workers.</p>
<p>We have to do an enormous effort by changing the image of the immigrant, of Mexico and of the Mexicans, and that implies, exactly, to put clear emphasis in the idea that we are here to build, we are for harmonizing with this great nation our efforts, because the prosperity of the U.S. is directly linked to immigrant labor especially Mexicans.</p>

					<p>I do not have anything against Mexico or Mexicans. The ones that make it to Minnesota are much more agreeable people than the black dregs that arrive here from Chicago, St. Louis and Detroit. It is unacceptable, however, that such large numbers of Mexicans access programs funded by American taxpayers and that regions of the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>are being forced to adopt <span class="caps">THEIR </span>culture. It is unacceptable that my children run the risk of living in a third world nation because of the presence of such vast numbers of Mexicans arriving here. If American companies really can&rsquo;t find enough workers they should open additional enterprises in Mexico, not import Mexicans to the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Of course, I am referring here to mestizo peasants and not white Hispanics.</p>

<p>Spoken by a foreign leader on American soil. Is there anyone who still doubts the <span class="caps">NAU </span>now?</p>
<p>30 million illegal invaders and their commander in chief stand in our streets. The leader calls for the invaders to mobilize, and for the United States to surrender our sovereignty. No one is &#8216;standing in the shadows&rsquo; anymore. The agenda is laid bare. Full-tilt in your face conquest along with the boldness to advertise their blueprint. Why aren&rsquo;t our tanks rolling on Mexico City right now?</p>
<p>Is there not a single politician left in America who will defend this nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic? Is there not one who will at least condemn the words of Calderon? Bush? McCain? Anybody? </p>

					<p>Interesting speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;this should remain clear that the Mexicans, that Mexico is not the enemy and Mexicans are not any threat for this great Nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently el Presidente doesn&rsquo;t read police reports and statistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;It also has been shown that the balance that the migrants costs the American taxpayer, this is false thus, this study that is not from the Government of Mexico&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently Calderon does know what it costs the taxpayers for the maternity wards, schools, prisons, courtrooms, hospital emergency rooms, border security, the costs of human suffering from rapists, drunk drivers, uninsured drivers, murderers, shoplifters, counterfeiters and more.</p>
<p>Is this man supposed to be educated? </p>

<p>They are illegal invaders, not undocumented workers and to say it is harassment or discrimination to be against this  invasion, and that&rsquo;s is what it is, adds insult to injury.  As an american, I&rsquo;m sick of the mexican crime wave, their draining of our welfare system and all the taxes we have to pay for their free medical care. Calderon doesn&rsquo;t care about his people, if he did, he wouldn&rsquo;t dump want to dump them off on another country. He just wants to guilt the US into taking on the corrupt mexican government&rsquo;s failures. Mexico doesn&rsquo;t tolerate illegal migration on its&rsquo; southern border, and the US should do what Mexico does. </p>

					<p>Well, considering they get free education, free medical and dental, taxfree money from working under the table, and send back billions to the motherland (or is it fatherland in Mexico)  &mdash;  and get away with all of this  &mdash;  -I would say you could make a case for them being &#8220;brave and strong.&#8221; We certainly know most of our politicians are weak and frightened wimps.</p>

					<p>If he loves his brave heroes, who have abandoned their families, communities &amp; country in order to set forth in illegal activity, why does he not say to them,  &#8220;Come back! We need you!  We need you to build highways in Zacatecas and Michoacan, we need you to support Mexican family values and culture as we build a better future for our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, in typical fashion, from millions of common Mexicans to the very highest elected official of their country, the only thing they have eyes for is stealing from us;  all the while claiming that they are not wrong to do so,  just like so many common criminals.  </p>
<p>When he actually does mention building Mexico, rather than El Presidente showing some leadership and rallying his lost citizens to come back &amp; do the job, all he can think to do is ask (How civil of him not to &#8220;demand&#8221;!) that we do it for him. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d call him totally worthless &amp; pathetic, but he is clearly engaged in something- supporting a Mexican invasion of the United States, and the appropriation of what is ours - and what neither he nor anyone not American has any right to. </p>

					<p>Why isn&rsquo;t the President of Mexico embarrassed that 20% of his countrymen have to leave Mexico for jobs in the United States?</p>
<p>Because it takes <span class="caps">BRAINS </span>to be embarassed by this crime against his fellow people&hellip;</p>
<p>Calderon sees his illegal immigrants as heroes&hellip; We Americans see them as <span class="caps">THIEVES AND PARASITES</span>! Thieves for the well-established Mexican predilection to thievery and petty crimes. In addition, of course, to their drug pushing crimes, nor forgetting their penchant for rape, even murder. Although admittedly, the &#8220;lesser&#8221; crimes are many times more prevalent, thanks to that Mexican mentality: You don&rsquo;t steal, you never get anywhere.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s their well-documented parasitism. Their tendency to hang on American taxpayers for their support. But that liar, Calderon, refuses to look at the ugly side of the immigration picture. Trying his best to distract our American people from the reality   &mdash;   what the <span class="caps">INVASION </span>really costs the American people.</p>

					<p>Your duty, Senor Calderone, is to quit keeping your masses poor while you and the few elite profit from a great many of your people breaking our laws. Any other president would be ashamed and embarrassed. They would come here to thank this government for paying for &#8220;their&#8221; people and promise to take them all home. No, you come proudly to see that illegal aliens have &#8220;rights.&#8221; You didn&rsquo;t care about them when they were in Mexico, but you come here demanding and threatning. You say we are alike. Senor, if there is any country that American&rsquo;s would like to forgot exists, it&rsquo;s Mexico and no, we don&rsquo;t break into other countries, rape, mruder, sponge, produce anchor babies, bring drugs, steal IDs and social security numbers, etc. No, we are <span class="caps">NOT </span>like you! </p>

					<p>Mexico&rsquo;s bravest and strongest aren&rsquo;t the ones crossing the border, and Caledron knows this.  They are the least educated, and of the lowest class.  They are discriminated against in Mexico, and Mexico doesn&rsquo;t want them.  As with all politicians, he is a bold faced liar.</p>

					<p>Civilized Neighbor, having grown up in a border state, I can tell you, you will come to change your mind about how they are &#8220;agreeable&#8221;, I promise. We all thought that way too at one time here. Adding to that the ones coming across now are not the same as those that crossed 20 years ago (much more violent and aggressive now). The general pattern for the ones that do come here just to work is they are quiet (prob b/c they don&rsquo;t speak english), keep to themselves, and work hard at back breaking jobs. The 2nd and 3rd generations however, having grown up in our schools, start looking and acting like the little gang bangers you see on <span class="caps">TV.</span> They become very aggressive, especially toward gringos. They take on much of the same patterns of blacks. Any perceived slight leads to violence quickly. They don&rsquo;t value education, have a high single parent population, don&rsquo;t want to work manual labor jobs, and start taking as much welfare as they can get (sound familiar). </p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that there are just too many hispanics invading us who have little to offer our advanced society or our culture, the biggest trouble will come down the road as the 2nd and 3rd generations (anchor baby citizens) become adults. They adopt the &#8220;entitlement&#8221; mentality, knock out kids like there is no tomorrow, see no value in education (and what good is uneducated person who does not want to do manual labor), will speak spanish even if they speak english fluently, and embrace the lawless sexist cultures of the hispanic countries. Add to that, they are fiercly proud of their race/ethnicity and are racists toward all others. So when they reach critical mass of the US population, we are in trouble. We must start thinking about the long term consequences of our policies and actions today if we are to ensure the same high quality of life for our children and grandchildren. However, I hold little hope our PC gov&rsquo;t and citizens will make the right choices. Most would rather give their children&rsquo;s futures away to avoid being called a racist. As the hispanics gain in population share, we will move more and more toward socialism. Afterall, it&rsquo;s easy to take away from the undeserving white man (envy) and give to the poor hispanics who were kept down via racist whites. Sorry but I do not see a good outcome to this. America needs to a vibrant strong white population to survive another 100 years.</p>

					<p>So correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong: American Renaissance is a website where people cry and whine about what&rsquo;s happening to the European cultures and peoples and yet make no effort to do anything about it. </p>
<p>You are putting out your message in the worst way possible. You&rsquo;re right about race differences in addition most of the other things you talk about and intelligent people will realize that. But, your average audience will find what you have to say distasteful at best.</p>
<p>Why not be promoters of liberty and work towards eliminating government interference in our lives? You can accomplish so many of your goals without ever mentioning race. Free people can hire, associate with, do business with, exclude, and rent to anyone they desire. Work on reforming the corrupt legal system to make it tougher to bring those nonsensical discrimination lawsuits. Cut the ties between business and government so they no longer have an incentive to hire based on race.</p>
<p>How many of you are involved in those meetup groups? How many of you are active in your home communities? Are you even talking to people about these ideas? Or do you just come home at night, complain on websites, and expect other people to do the work?</p>

					<p>Uggh, even the President of Mexico uses that PC buzzword &#8220;undocumented&#8221; to describe illegal Mexican Immigrants. That is one of the stupidest terms ever devised.</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago when this term started being thrown around I was really confused what it meant. I thought that it meant some poor immigrant left his green card in his pockets when he dropped his pants off at the Laundromat and subsequently was falsely deported by the <span class="caps">INS </span>because he lost his documents and was thus &#8220;undocumented&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I learned this term while working at a college internship and having just moved from a more rural area to a large city had no idea that &#8220;illegal immigrant&#8221; was now considered a racial slur rivaling the &#8220;N word&#8221; on the scale of offensiveness and was nearly kicked out of the internship program for my insensitivity for my use of the Double &#8220;I word&#8221;.</p>

					<p>Thousands of Americans die on our highways every year just going to and from work, so four hundred invaders who got whats coming to them is hardly cause for alarm.  At least they had the option to stay in their own country where they belong, whereas most Americans must drive to work&hellip; </p>

<p>I agree in Spirit with what the original poster said and I actually was part of a residents&rsquo; group in my town.  We were having a serious problem with out of state landlords who were renting to minorities whose rent was being subsidized either through Section 8 or by the State subsidy program. There were incidents of vandalism, B &amp; E, intimidation of tax paying residents, bullying in the local school and a host of other things.  We managed to force a change in zoning laws and rental regulations.  We also got an ordinance passed that permitted un-announced inspections of rental properties to determine that the number of people living in the dwelling did not exceed that prescribed by the rental ordinance. After several assaults and a rape in which a young woman returned home one night from work  opened her closet and was set upon by the perpetrator who had hidden himself there (Yes he was a member of the race that we dare not mention, that is to say a &#8220;Canadian&#8221;),we formed neighborhood watch groups that worked with the PD and thereby preempted many minor and major crimes.</p>
<p>However, what can be feasible in a small town is not so easy in a large urban area.  </p>
<p>Wild eyed Charlie is right about whom on can trust. Unless I misinterpreted your response, I assume that those two people were family members. <br>
Making broad statements about freedom of association automatically interprets as not wanting to associate with minorities and one immediately becomes a social leper.</p>

					<p>To the Anonymous poster at 2:17 PM Feb 15:</p>
<p>Just because we don&rsquo;t seem to have any big victories (even though I count the failure of the McKennedybush Soft Amnesty as a big victory), doesn&rsquo;t mean that there aren&rsquo;t little victories.  I have found that political activism is far more about the little things than the big things.</p>

					<p>When is Jorge Bush going to tell his countrymen they have risked their lives by allowing this foreign horde to invade us?  That there is a history of heroism in protecting our homes and our daughters, our country is supporting you and is with you all the way.(laughter heard in back rows)</p>

					<p>&#8220;<b>Mexico&rsquo;s bravest and strongest aren&rsquo;t the ones crossing the border, and Caledron knows this.</b> (Emphasis added.) They are the least educated, and of the lowest class. They are discriminated against in Mexico, and Mexico doesn&rsquo;t want them. As with all politicians, he is a bold faced liar.</p>

<p>Good point. I have yet to meet any Mexicana Airlines pilots who threw it all away to mow lawns in La Jolla.</p>

<p>Do you see the circular argument?  Isn&rsquo;t avoiding social lepers just another form of discrimination?  Doesn&rsquo;t that go against egalitarianism?</p>
