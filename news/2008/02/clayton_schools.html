						<p>Anger. Sadness. Frustration. These were the emotions of many weary Clayton County parents, students and community leaders Sunday as the county&rsquo;s school district deals with its most challenging crisis in memory.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools said infighting among school board members and violations of board procedures have made the district &#8220;fatally flawed&#8221; and recommended that Clayton&rsquo;s accreditation be revoked, effective Sept. 1.</p>
<p>If Clayton loses its accreditation, students will no longer be eligible for HOPE scholarships and will find it tougher to get into some colleges. HOPE, a state-administered financial aid program, requires applicants to have attended accredited schools. This year&rsquo;s graduating class would not be affected.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some remember it was just five years ago that SACS put the Clayton school district on probation after finding some school board members had little understanding of their responsibilities or just violated board policies.</p>
<p>Although Chairwoman Ericka Davis is the only member remaining from that board, many wonder how a new group of school board members could repeat what SACS officials said are some of the same mistakes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clayton County, just south of Atlanta&rsquo;s city limits, has suffered in recent years from rising crime and the highest mortgage foreclosure rate in the metro area. Its school district is in jeopardy of becoming just the third in the nation &mdash; and the first in Georgia &mdash; to lose its accreditation in the past 20 years.</p>

<p>What is the racial makeup of the other two distrcits?</p>
<p>And these are considered some of the best of the African American leadership?</p>
<p>I wonder how many of these school board members were given their degrees through Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>Want to fix this matter? Put white men in charge and let them fix it. (Won&rsquo;t happen)</p>
<p>Maybe <span class="caps">OBAMA </span>can change this and make it work.</p>
<p>I see that there appears to be at least one token white guy. Maybe they can blame all of this on his racism&hellip;..<br>

					<p>This what you pay real estate taxes for, totally incompetent buffons who are placed in these positions because of the color of their skin. The appropriate use of taxpayer funds and the education of the children are of no consequence and no concern. If things don&rsquo;t go to well this year, that&rsquo;s o.k. They&rsquo;ll just raise your taxes next year to &#8216;improve&rsquo; the situation. </p>

					<p>Man, it is hell watching Clayton county drift into Henry county. Many Henry county schools that were once decent have degenerated into behavior modification and parenting proxies. Over 80% have school lunch vouchers. Young blacks terrorize businesses and neighborhoods that were once tranquil and peace loving havens for white rural residents who are now ruing the day the farmers sold their land to developers. Many black teenage girls try out their depraved and witless behavior in white and asian businesses and in the streets causing racial friction and police visits. What were nice neighborhoods are now rooted with section 8 houses and folks who &#8220;adopt&#8221; troubled teenagers, using state payments for to pay off their crazy mortgages. Jamaican Restaurants are situated next to rib shacks. White flight is heavy in Western Henry county. No one wants to live here anymore. This is ghetto fabulous invades Mayberry. Can you imagine any greater travesty?</p>

					<p>Clayton County went from being 72% white in 1990 to 38% white in 2000 and 30% white in 2006.</p>
<p>So, given that information, is anyone really surprised?  I&rsquo;m not.</p>

					<p>The black Clayton county sheriff who fired all the whites in his organization cost the county millions in the subsequent law suit.</p>
<p>This county was pretty much like any other here in GA until the blacks started moving in. Then it started making the headlines for all the things that follow blacks where ever they are in the world.</p>

					<p>They be fightin&rsquo;! The sad reality is that blacks cannot govern themselves. When whites provide the leadership and organizational structure, a functional organization can exist. I can think of no black city, organization or country that is not disfunctional.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before, but this sheriff has a billboard on Tara Blvd. that reads:<br>
NO <span class="caps">LITTERING, LOITERING,</span> OR <span class="caps">LOUD MUSIC</span><br><br>
<span class="caps">VIOLATIONS WILL</span> BE <span class="caps">ENFORCED</span>!<br><br>
Is it just me, or is there really something idiotic about wanting to enforce violations?<br><br>
Isn&rsquo;t it just shocking that the schools are a mess?<br><br>
Let me know if you would like a photo of the billboard - I will gladly email it to you.</p>

					<p>You know what, they&rsquo;ll blame all this on Georgia governor Sonny Perdue.</p>
<p>Remember the bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta? The family of the black woman that died, filed a lawsuit, against those they thought were responsible.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t file against Atlanta&rsquo;s mayor- she was black.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t file against the Atlanta police commissioner - he was black.</p>
<p>They filed suit against the chairman of the Atlanta Olympic Organizing Committee, Billy Payne, who is Caucasian. </p>

					<p>The story of Clayton county, Georgia&rsquo;s transformation from a White, blue-collar &#8216;burb of Atlanta into something approaching Zimbabwe is a story in itself. Much of metro Atlanta&rsquo;s violent crime is concentrated in Clayton and its immediate neighbor, DeKalb. Ordinary Whites have began using the code words &#8220;Clayton and DeKalb&#8221; with the obligatory sideways glances when describing the burgeoning anarchy there. Most news stories from these diversity paradises are about car chases, carjackings, home invasions, rape and murder, often over the most idiotic issues. It is worse than Buford Highway. </p>
<p>Much of these two majority non-White counties are apartment complexes - thank you, Section 8. A recent Atlanta Constipation article on the mortgage debacle showed a map of foreclosures in metro Atlanta&hellip;Clayton led the pack, followed by other counties in exact proportion to their number on non-Whites. &#8220;Racist&#8221; Forsyth county had the fewest.</p>
<p>Clayton&rsquo;s &#8220;Mugabe&#8221; is Sheriff Victor Hill, aka &#8220;walking small&#8221; (at 5&rsquo;, he is not <span class="caps">NBA </span>material).He is still involved in a costly (to taxpayers) litigation over his highhanded firing of a group of mostly White deputies when black Democrats seized power there several years back.</p>
<p>It is said that Georgia will be majority non-White in less than ten years&hellip;I&rsquo;m ready for that move to Montana.</p>

					<p>I do not believe in mandatory public education.  I certainly do not believe it is a wise use of taxpayer money to attempt to educate blacks.  One might as well throw you money down the drain, it would be simpler.</p>

					<p>Houston has similar conditions. Every school district run by <br>
blacks for blacks is financially insolvent, facing dis-accreditation. Just like the homeland, the purpose of holding <br><br>
elective office is to loot the treasury and pad the payrolls <br><br>
with kin. Not only incompetent but totally dis-honest. No hope <br><br>
this will ever change.<br><br>

					<p>At Halliburton/KBR, sexual assault is just part of the workplace experience 
for women Like many viewers, I watched this <span class="caps">ABC</span> 20/20 report when it first aired <br>
in December with jaws-open, eyes-bugging horror. It told the story of two women <br>
workers for Halliburton/KBR who had been sent to Iraq. There, one, Jamie Lee <br>
Jones, a young computer tech, was gang-raped on her fourth day by coworkers <br>
after being drugged; the other, Tracy Barker, was sexually assaulted by a State <br>
Department employee. Both immediately reported their assaults, only to have <br>
<span class="caps">KBR </span>first lock them in isolation, then question their accusations. In the case <br>
of Jones, it even &#8220;lost&#8221; the medical report that documented evidence <br>
of gang rape.<br> <br>

					<p>If anyone has any doubts about the blacks ability to rule himself in a cival manner, look at their native land. In afrika they kill each other with little or no provocation, add to this mix the evil of islam and you have &#8220;murder the infidel in the name of allah&#8221; in the lowest form.  Find one single &#8216;positive&rsquo; accomplishment in the dark continent.  As much as I was brainwashed to believe &#8220;poor black person, so mis-treated, no education/opportunity/respect, needs a helping hand from the bad mean racist white person&#8221;, the truth is&hellip;my dog is better behaved and is always loyal to the hand that feeds it.</p>
