<p>&#8220;Based on strikingly irrational beliefs and emotions, modern liberals relentlessly undermine the most important principles on which our freedoms were founded,&#8221; says Dr. Lyle Rossiter, author of the new book, &#8220;The Liberal Mind: The Psychological Causes of Political Madness.&#8221; &#8220;Like spoiled, angry children, they rebel against the normal responsibilities of adulthood and demand that a parental government meet their needs from cradle to grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For more than 35 years [Dr. Rossiter] has diagnosed and treated more than 1,500 patients as a board-certified clinical psychiatrist and examined more than 2,700 civil and criminal cases as a board-certified forensic psychiatrist. He received his medical and psychiatric training at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Rossiter says the kind of liberalism being displayed by the two major candidates for the Democratic Party presidential nomination can only be understood as a psychological disorder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Rossiter says the liberal agenda preys on weakness and feelings of inferiority in the population by:</p>
<p>	*&nbsp;creating and reinforcing perceptions of victimization;</p>
<p>	*&nbsp;satisfying infantile claims to entitlement, indulgence and compensation;</p>
<p>	*&nbsp;augmenting primitive feelings of envy;</p>
<p>	*&nbsp;rejecting the sovereignty of the individual, subordinating him to the will of the government.</p>
<p>&#8220;The roots of liberalism &mdash; and its associated madness &mdash; can be clearly identified by understanding how children develop from infancy to adulthood and how distorted development produces the irrational beliefs of the liberal mind,&#8221; he says. &#8220;When the modern liberal mind whines about imaginary victims, rages against imaginary villains and seeks above all else to run the lives of persons competent to run their own lives, the neurosis of the liberal mind becomes painfully obvious.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;A single idea has dominated our [last, i.e., 20th] century, supported by the two pillars of contemporary thought, the psychology of Freud and Marxist socialism; namely, that the individual does not bear the main responsibility for what he is and does. [&hellip;] These two a priori conceptions of human experience turn us into vulnerable, powerless individuals, wanting to be taken care of.&#8221;    &mdash;   Jean-Louis Servan-Schreiber, The Return of Courage.</p>

			<p>I have been trying to explain this to people for years.  Its called schizophrenia.  Like Liberals all schizophrenics get along well with each other but fight and become violent with normal authoriety figures like parents, doctors, employers, and anyone not sensed as one of them.  This is why Obamma, Hillary, and even John Edwards sound like Hitler and Stalin.  Its why their followers behave like supporters of Hitler and Stalin.  </p>

			<p>     Don&rsquo;t fall for that. These liberals know exactly what they want. They crave power over you and will do almost anything to get it. They will use the tactics of a Stalin, Mao, or a Hitler to achieve their ends. In their minds, what they are doing is noble and honorable and you are just a self-centered schmuck who doesn&rsquo;t understand that they are doing humanity&rsquo;s work. To them, you are just a piece of dirt that stands in their way of achieving an utopian state. For that reason they are more dangerous than you can know or imagine.</p>

			<p>The theses presented in this article seem to corraborate well with recent findings about genetic causes of political beliefs. So, liberalism is not just a mental disease; it&rsquo;s a genetic mental disease. In other words, the kids of liberals are very likely to end up as liberals, too. A fact to think of for each of you who compassinately help them to have the kids that they otherwise would not afford.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Mikeh&#8221; sort of stole my thunder already. While that assessment of Liberalism is surely right on the mark, modern &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; are scarcely any better and indeed, share some of the same childish qualities - they just manifest in different ways. None of it bodes well for America and it certainly doesn&rsquo;t look good for the White race!! </p>

Agreed, mikeh.  Neoconservatism is as bad as liberalism.  In a way, neoconservatism is worse, because it masquerades as conservatism.  Just look at the Republican Party circa 2008.</p>
<p>President McCain?  Think amnesty, perpetual war, and draconian gun control measures.  At least if Obama becomes president, the Republicans in the House and Senate will resist most of his more odious proposals.  Not so if &#8220;McKennedy&#8221; becomes prez.  </p>

			<p>They missed the most obvious one - that gun control works to protect the &#8220;people.&#8221; Of course, those that argue this position like Chicago Mayor Daley, Diane Feinstein, Jesse Jackson are never asked why it is that THEY have private firearms or PUBLICALLY financed armed policemen protecting them.</p>

			<p>While nice to see in print, I don&rsquo;t think any rational person needed a psychiatrist to tell them that. The absolute absurdity, and completely incomprehensable insanity of the ruling elites and those that favor them, is beyond belief. There is no room for compromise. There is no give and take. It is all &#8216;I know what is best and you are stupid, so shut up and let me do what I want to&rsquo;. They have no respect for the rule of law. They have no respect for the constitution. They have no respect for the white race, the white homelands, you, your sons and daughters, or for the blood our soldiers have spilled on the battle fields of the world defending this country. How did these nut cases ever get in charge of things?</p>

			<p>What about the psychopathology of true believers in the free market who worship the corporation. Of course the University of Chicago is the home of an economics depaertment whose faculty members worship the corporation.</p>
<p>There is a very interesting documentary out with the title &#8220;The corpration as a psychopath&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberals are weirdos. But so are worshippers of the free market and corporations such as Dr. Rossisiter.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before; a liberal is someone who imagines a world they would like to live in, and then proceeds to pretend that they actually live in such a world.</p>
<p>Many people get over this as children, but liberals continue the habit for a lifetime.</p>

			<p>And another thing, Liberalism is only allowed to exist in  conservative democratic societies, they are they only society willing to tolerate the liberal ideology,  liberals don&rsquo;t seem to grasp or appriciate this. I don&rsquo;t know if conservatism can exist in a liberal society, has there ever been a liberal society that survived long enough to test this? Liberalism is nothing more than a side effect of the larger Conservative ideology</p>

Jupiter confuses free market capitalism with mercantilism.  This is a very common mistake.  Capitalism is simply the organic, bottom up organization of free men living their lives.  Mercantilism, an old variant, or maybe precursor, of socialism, is more akin to what exists in the United State today.  It is a collaboration of powerful business and government to shield those businesses from the vagaries of the free market(the real collective will of the people). <br>

<p>Marxists do not have a mental disorder.  They have a character disorder.  I tend to agree with Dr. Szasz on the concept of mental illness. (If you don&rsquo;t know, Google.)  The psychiatrist in question is doing nothing more than engaging in sophisticated name-calling.  For instance, I can not run as fast as a professional track star, but that does not mean there is anything wrong with my legs.  I may have some genetic predisposition toward envy, or maybe am too quick to anger, but that does not mean I have some sort of organic brain defect.  It does mean that I may have to work a bit harder to improve my character in those area than others.  We are all imperfect, or for the Christian, sinners, and I assert that there is an objective external standard of morals and ethics, whether one arrives at it rationally (Rothbard et all), or religiously.  These are usually the first things marxists dismiss as cultural artifacts, no more worthy of respect than the animistic beliefs of some prehistoric African tribe.  The character defect the psychiatrist has detected in this case is nothing more than the long historically noted selling of freedom for perceived security.</p>

			<p>The University of Chicago was financed by the Rockefeller family.</p>
<p>Second, all &#8220;belief&#8221; structures are the same.</p>
<p>1) Man is inferior to a &#8220;god&#8221; be it THE LORD, THE STATE, etc.</p>
<p>2) Man is a &#8220;sinner&#8221; and falls short of the wishes of GOD/STATE</p>
<p>3) The GOD/STATE exists to save and redeem man from his faults (the faults listed and made up by GOD/STATE).</p>
<p>4) Only the GOD/STATE can &#8220;save&#8221; mankind.</p>
<p>5) All &#8220;men&#8221; are equal losers in this system.</p>
<p>6) The individual is evil, &#8220;has a hard heart&#8221;, is a heretic, is disobedient, is a &#8220;sinner and born that way, and has to worship GOD/STATE or be punished now or latter.</p>
<p>7) It makes no difference what you call this GOD/STATE, either America, Third Reich, Cuba, Christianity, Judaism, Maoism, Secularism, Jim Jones, Billy Graham, Nazi Party, Kiwanas, etc. It is all the same. They are all identical.</p>
<p>How can you tell? Any organization that tells you that you NEED them and without them you are defective, it is one. RUN from it. It is pure evil and is out to destroy your very existence. The more it wants to &#8220;save you&#8221; the more evil and nasty it is. So, don&rsquo;t think you are different and your favorit GOD/STATE is different.</p>
<p>This is why our constitution was the finest document ever written by man since it put the individual FIRST and the rights of the individual FIRST. We have spend the last 250 years destroying it by trying to &#8220;save&#8221; our fictitious &#8220;souls&#8221; or this fantasy called &#8220;society&#8221;. Good luck.</p>

			<p>My friend, who is almost NOT a liberal anymore (thanks to my incessant re-education), still clings to some of her Socialist leanings.  I always tell her (and other liberals) that nothing stops them from sending in as much of THEIR money to the government that they want.</p>

			<p>Outstanding.  I just posted yesterday on the worthlessness of a psychology that failed to recognize White self-hatred as mental illness, and I&rsquo;m glad to be proven wrong, though I&rsquo;m certain that Dr Rossiter is not representative of mental health professionals as a group.  Still, as a new, genetically based understanding of racial differences emerges, the shrinks will need a new paradigm if they are not to join the diversity consultants in irrelevance and unemployment.</p>

			<p>Anyone including liberals and conservatives who do not change their point of view even in the face of irrefutable evidence to the contrary are all &#8216;mentally ill&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Most extremists are not in touch with reality because they are motivated to see the world through their skewed view of reality. It is madness when the liberals refuse to see that the blacks are not capable of functioning in a civilized society even in the face of violent acting out by the blacks all over the world.</p>
<p>I disagree with Bush supporters and evangelical Christians. It is insanity for evangelicals to push for creationism as a major issue while we are struggling with fundamental issues of identity and nationhood.</p>
<p>Bush claiming to care about the &#8216;average Americans&rsquo; is stupid since if he cared so much he wouldn&rsquo;t have lied to us about Iraq and sent young kids to die to help his oil business. Many Americans are still taken in by his goofy grin and reassurances that he will protect the &#8216;American way of life&rsquo;. This too is insane.</p>

			<p>I think what makes liberals appear nuts is not that they are so pathologically, but rather by choice. Why is it, that every single liberal who posts on various blogs always sounds the same? It is as if they are following some script, some program, and I think that is the reason they sound nuts. It is actually a case of massive brain washing for most of them.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m very impressed withthis author and will certainly get his book, as someone has pointed out the talk show host Michael S has been on to this for years. <br>
Re some posts here:<br>
My instinct is to disagree with those who think that Conservatives and Capitalists (neocons or whatever term you choose)are suffering from a mental disorder. If one believes, as some do, that there is a conspiracy of NeoConservatives behind every corporation/disaster/war and so forth, how does that make them weird and crazy? surely they&rsquo;re just carrying out their secret plan to reach their objective of world domination,a New World Order or whatever,and quite successfully it would seem. Is this not quite different from welcoming the fox into the chicken coop? can someone explain to me what it is they believe the Neo Conservatives endgame is. Free Market Capitalism is a very successful economic system, folks are flooding here to embrace it,and even with it&rsquo;s flaws it seems to be doing very nicely so I don&rsquo;t have a problem with there.<br>
 The difference between these apparently scheming Neocons and the Liberal&rsquo;s mindset is that what Liberals state they are aiming for, .ie. Utopia, a better world for all,egalitarianism, control of the Universal climate, one world racial harmony and so forth, are concepts that can only be accepted if one embraces some type of cognitive dissonance and contorts the meaning of words,ideas and facts.<br>
For example, Leftists have seen the horrors of Socialism, Fascism and other totalitarian regimes, yet they still race headlong into the arms of another monster, Islamist Fascism. Just look at what the British Foreign minister, Socialist David Milliband said in November about the expansion of the European Union market; that it should be expanded to include North Africa and the Middle East, that Europeans must keep their promise to Turkey with its 50 million Moslems to join the EU, and that Europe must accept 20 million Africans and Asians(Pakistanis,Bangladeshis etc) within the next few decades, so allowing hundreds of millions of Moslems into Christian Europe, - even as the Mullahs are stating openly that they want to Islamicise Europe. To me this is true madness. As is their denial and whitewashing of the association of their belief system Socialism with oppression and anti-Semitism and totalitarian dictatorships.<br>
 <br>
Any illuminating explanations about NeoCons and their dastardly schemes are very welcome. I&rsquo;ll check back. (Pl.keep it simple!)<br>

			<p>George Orwell pegged this disorder in his great satirical, dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1948). In Newspeak it was called &#8216;doublethink&rsquo; - the necessary ability of party members to hold and believe two conradictory thoughts at the same time.  Today we call it PC. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is such a great idea&hellip; a few months ago, i recall Amren readers were outraged that some psychiatrists were considering classifying &#8216;racism&rsquo; (broadly defined) as a &#8216;disorder&rsquo; possibly requiring &#8216;treatment&rsquo;&hellip;.<br>

			<p>There must be more to this. Rossiter perfectly discribed the behavior of Georgw W. Bush, Rush Limbaugh, and Pat Bucanhon as being crazy liberals. Many people consider these people to be consevatives. Many the book will explain it better. </p>

<p>You claimed free markets=collective will of the people.Nothing could be further from the truth. Americans want protection form the more brutal aspects of the free market.</p>
<p>If there is one thing you can be sure of it is this:free market enthusiast do not raise or treat thier children according to free market principles. Nor do neo-liberal economics enthusiast raise and treat their children according to neo-liberal principles. Free market and neoliberal enthusaists are well aware that these economic systems/philosophies are ethically evil and destructuive to human beings.</p>
<p>If Ron Paul is an example of what a true believer in free market principles believes in, labor will be crushed under the jackboot of the corporation.Paul views labor and corporations as equal players at the bargaining table. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have never heard or read a free market true believer advocating striping corporations of their rights as human beings. I&rsquo;m a realist about things. I believe in describing reality the way it is.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In the popular television serials that have bombarded children since the 1950s, the good guy always wins. Every time. Every week. After a spell, the mere consideration of his failure becomes unthinkable, that his virtue incomplete impossible. So, he must ever triumph. For God, Country and Maytag.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started to blame everything on television. It is my &ldquo;whitey.&rdquo; If I sit here stupid and fat, TV is the reason. </p>

<p>I share this view. I believe that television has become our greatest enemy. It is the Frankenstein monster created by (the White) man that will destroy him if the highest moral or ethical standards are neglected in its use. Television functions like hymnosis and in some ways like a drug. As a propaganda tool, its power is overwhelming for many people. All too many people take their view of the world from what they see on the &#8216;tube.&rsquo; Someone has even written a book on why television should be abandoned. In fact, a famous sci-fi writer once wrote a short story in which the streets were policed to make sure that all the citizens were at home watching television every evening.</p>

			<p>I remember a book about why tv should be abandoned  &mdash;  something like Four Arguments for Abolishing Television. The author was named Jerry Mander (not kidding  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s how I remembered the book). I read this in the late 1970s, IIRC.</p>

Under Communism, it&rsquo;s the other way around&#8221;.<br>
      Commander Rockwell: &#8220;Liberalism is Communism&rsquo;s pimping<br>
little sister&#8221;.<br>
      Both Communism and Capitalism are materialistic systems of<br>
culture and economics in which the former is subordinated to the<br>
latter. Both create a centralized system of money and capital<br>
and therefore, political power. Communism presents this in a <br>
straight forward theoretical format. Capitalism pretends other-<br>
wise but approaches it in a developmental fashion-this is where<br>
the everchanging liberalism come in as the ersatz philosophy of<br>
the moment.<br>
      The Communist Revolution was financed by the International<br>
Bankers. If you think they are a imaginary, you need to do alot<br>
of thinking and reading. The Liberal Agenda and the Gay Revolu-<br>
tion are funded by the same group via the great foundations, Car-<br>
negie, Rockerfeller, etc.<br>
      America was never more prosperous than when people and com-<br>
panies were loyal to her. Yes this means tariffs. Sustained and<br>
vigorous use of the tariff is one of the keys to prosperity. We<br>
cannot compete with slave labor-unless we become even better <br>

<p>You might want to start with Adam Smiths classic book on free markets. Smith understood the dangers of unregulated free markets.</p>
<p>A few concrete examples, the farm worker labor market, the new rust belt in the midwest and working coniditions for Kentucky and West Virginia coal minere in the 1960s and the 1970&rsquo;s. These are a few examples of free market principles implemented in the real.</p>
<p>I support protectionist policies for American workers.</p>
<p>White Nationalism and a pure free market economy and labor markets are incompatible. White Americans will reject it.</p>

			<p>I have noticed that what many right-wing Americans often seem to call &#8216;liberalism&rsquo; I would rather see as &#8216;Marxism&rsquo;. Classsical Liberalism could also be seen as being concerned with freedom from the State. However, the conclusions he reaches about such Left-Wing types accords with my experiences. My friend and I have often noticed such traits in friends, colleagues, politicians and the Media class. It is a funny thing about Marxism, they believe that we are born &#8216;tabula rasa&rsquo;, blank slates, and it is only the inequalities and injustices of life that turn people &#8216;bad&rsquo;. Very idealistic of them. Yet in spite of their dominance of our societies for forty years or more (arguably a lot longer) none of them seem to show any signs of slackening their grip on power, and do not seem to act as if their own policies are getting us any nearer to this elusive utopia. They are waging a sophisticated and insidious propaganda war to &#8216;change the consciousness&rsquo; of the population primarily through the education system and the mass media, but deep down they know that reality, bioligy and human nature constantly ask questions of their beliefs which they cannot answer, and this will be apparant to anyone with his wits about him. Hence the need for permanant revolution. Hence the need to stifle debate with feigned moral outrage, and increasingly outright lies. It is a revolution against reality. <br>
They are romantic idealists, who always turn out to be the most totaletarean when given the chance. They believe their opinions in themselves make them generous and kind, no effort or personal sacrifice is required. I have usually found them to be quite selfish, and would often not dream of helping others unless they were being paid to do it. Often vain, they like to imagine they are, in the words of the Bob Dylan track, &#8216;forever young&rsquo;. In truth their opinions are the intellectual equivalent of the greying pony tail of a balding 50 year-old man. Clinton and Blair were such people, always whipping out their guitars and saxaphones at the slightest opportunity..pathetic in everday life, but suicidally dangerous when in control. As the chap in the article says, they hate the thought of adulthood, and the responsibilities it entails- not least the responsiblities to your Nation, Race and Culture. Great civilisations are a testament to the incredible discipline and sacrifices that previous generations were prepared to make for them, both in their personal lives and in their national lives. They thought their culture was worth it. In the West we are going to slowly learn that you never get something for nothing, and they have been bribed and cajoled by such people into state-sponsored anarchy.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Capitalism is simply the organic, bottom up organization of free men living their lives. Mercantilism, an old variant, or maybe precursor, of socialism, is more akin to what exists in the United State today. It is a collaboration of powerful business and government to shield those businesses from the vagaries of the free market(the real collective will of the people).&#8221; </p>

&#8220;Classical liberals&#8221; like John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison would be considered libertarians today, and would soundly reject BOTH the Democratic Party and the Republican Party today, since both parties worship bloated government.</p>
<p>Locke, Jefferson, and Madison feared that a strong central government would usurp the rights of its citizens in its quest for consolidating more and more power.  Turns out they were exactly right.</p>

			<p>I think it&rsquo;s simpler than that. To want things that sound like they&rsquo;re &#8220;good&#8221;, like health care, etc. for ALL children is EASY. It literally uses no-brain. To put some thought and research into the costs and practicality and engineering of such things takes work. Why work at understanding things when there are so many people agreeing and well-known people supporting them? It is easy just to stand for &#8220;good&#8221; caring issues, without coming to those conclusions individually. In conclusion, you can&rsquo;t be a supporter of liberal issues if you THINK. Politicians benefitting from liberal supporters are just taking advantage.</p>
