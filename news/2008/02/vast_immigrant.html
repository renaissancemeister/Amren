						<p>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) &mdash; U.S. immigration officials said on Thursday they had dismantled a Guatemalan human smuggling ring that brought more than 100 illegal immigrants a week into the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said 13 people, including two of the suspected ringleaders, face charges in connection with what officials described as one of the largest human smuggling operations uncovered on the West Coast in recent years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to court documents, immigration agents uncovered an organization run by Guatemalan nationals that provided housing and transport to immigrants who had already been smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border to Phoenix.</p>
<p>The immigrants were taken from Arizona to the Los Angeles area where they were held in drop houses before being loaded onto vehicles and driven to U.S. cities around the nation.</p>
<p>The immigrants, mostly from Central America, paid the organization between $1,200 and $3,700 each for the journey.</p>

			<p>What we should do is show the Guatemalans how to sneak into Mexico, get jobs there,and  keep from being caught, just like the Mexican government shows Mexicans how to do the same to us.</p>

			<p>Maybe we will get lucky and they can all go live at Senator McCain&rsquo;s house.  I am sure his wife would like that.  Rather then dump them into my house, and my schools, and my streets they can all live 140 per room at his house.  Although, that might be 1600 Pennsylvania Street in a year.  Whoops.</p>

			<p>Oh wow.  Almost one million illegals are coming into America every year and 100 were caught.  America must be spun off into two nations like Serbia and Kosovo were spun off.</p>

			<p>In relation to this story, on Lou Dobbs tonight it was stated that the feds had been investigating this ring for three years before it was busted&hellip;..inexcusable.<br>
 At 100 Criminal Illegal Alien Invaders per week we get a total of 15,600 CIAI&rsquo;s in 3 years while under the watchful eyes of our diligent federal law agencies. If 50% were female and have accidentally gotten pregnant that brings it up to 23,400 CIAI&rsquo;s. </p>

			<p>I kinda doubt this ring is actually in category of huge, maybe for Guatemalans, but these &#8220;drop or safe houses&#8221; are all over U.S., in some of the most unlikely places, very organized, move huge numbers very efficently, some of these drop sites actually have bunkhouses that can accomodate 50 or 60 illegals for a number of days.</p>

			<p>Burn the drop houses, no matter where they are found. Confiscate the property, we have that ability. Make property owners aware that they cannot make big bucks off of drop houses and look the other way. &#8220;I did not know&#8221; is not a good excuse.</p>

			<p>Guatemalans are a bit more &#8216;exotic&rsquo; than some who cross the ol&rsquo; canal into the U.S. Unfortunately, diversity is not what is in current short supply within our demographic.</p>

			<p>Are these smugglers any more abhorrent than the lobbyists in Washington, who press the government to keep legal immigration running at record levels? </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how eminent domain is applied to seize houses deemed to be in the way of &#8220;progress&#8221; and yet, crime houses such as these, which exploit people, are simply overlooked, and the exploited hide in plain sight.  You can see them at our fast food stops, our motels, our carwashes, but do you really SEE them?  No, because they never become part of the greater community, never serve on boards, they don&rsquo;t run for office and they never volunteer&hellip; they&rsquo;re just here for the money.  They want to be anonymous and unknown and NOT known for what they are&hellip; illegal.  They aren&rsquo;t here to make the community better, like when a taxpayer&rsquo;s home or property is seized for eminent domain.  And I&rsquo;m not complaining that mine has; I&rsquo;ve never owned a home in my life, because I can&rsquo;t afford to on my own, and I don&rsquo;t want to bunk up with a bunch of people, which is exactly how some of these properties are bought and paid for, like modern day slavery.  Faceless slaves, using our freeways and easements to make wider freeways, taken by eminent domain.</p>

			<p>Memphomaniac&rsquo;s idea is an excellent one.  The feds and local police use property forfeiture all the time; I think seizure might be the ticket for the second or third offense.  Otherwise,<br>
the property owners might be positioned by third world race hustlers as martyrs for diversity.  To extend Memphomaniac&rsquo;s idea, how about seizure of orchards and farms of chronic agribusiness offenders?</p>

			<p>Crunching some numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;more than 100 illegal immigrants a week into the Los Angeles area.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;nearly three-year investigation was sparked by the discovery in May 2005&#8221; It was probably in operation 6 month to a year before it was discovered. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 15,600 to 20,000.<br>
&#8220;<br>
paid the organization between $1,200 and $3,700 each for the journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>or $18 to 74 million.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a new bill proposed by Mcclintobam that all illegals caught henceforth will have one kidney seized, this will definitely help stop this invasion.</p>

			<p>Tyson Brands was busted several years ago for a similar scam involving importing thousands of illegals from Guatemala.  How much do you want to bet that this enterprise is bankrolled by American corporations?</p>

			<p>New Rules:</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants will be lined up and executed.</p>
<p>A firm date for illegals to leave will be established.</p>
<p>After that there is a bounty of all illegals.</p>
<p>Penalty death.</p>
<p>This will solve drug traffic and immigration problems right away.</p>
<p>Might be a few mistakes but them is the breaks.</p>
<p>A hard line is the only way to survive.</p>

<p>We need to buy up all the landmines from around the world and place them along the southern border. That way, we can have a &#8220;virtual&#8221; fence that actually WORKS.</p>
