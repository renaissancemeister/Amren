						<p>Le Blanc and I are into our 500th kilometer on the river when he turns my view of modern African history on its head. &#8220;We should just give it all back to the whites,&#8221; the riverboat captain says. &#8220;Even if you go 1,000 kilometers down this river, you won&rsquo;t see a single sign of development. When the whites left, we didn&rsquo;t just stay where we were. We went backwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;The river is the artery of Congo&rsquo;s economy,&#8221; he says. &#8220;When the Belgians and the Portuguese were here, there were farms and plantations &mdash; cashews, peanuts, rubber, palm oil. There was industry and factories employing 3,000 people, 5,000 people. But since independence, no Congolese has succeeded. The plantations are abandoned.&#8221; Using a French expression literally translated as &#8220;on the ground,&#8221; he adds: &#8220;Everything is <i>par terre.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that our journey through 643 kilometers of rainforest to where the Maringa River joins the Congo at Mbandaka, has been an exploration of decline. {snip} There are no schools here, no clinics, no electricity, no roads. It can take a year for basic necessities ordered from the capital, Kinshasa, nearly 2,000 kilometers downstream, to make it here &mdash; if they make it at all. At one point we pass a cargo barge that has taken three months to travel the same distance we will cover in two days. We stop in the hope of buying some gasoline, but all we get from the vessel are rats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Around 45,000 people die each month in the DRC as a result of the social collapse brought on by civil war, according to a study released in January by the International Rescue Committee. It estimated the total loss of life between 1998 and April 2007 at 5.4 million. For many Congolese like Le Blanc, the difficulties of today blot out the cruelties of the past. &#8220;On this river, all that you see &mdash; the buildings, the boats &mdash; only whites did that. After the whites left, the Congolese did not work. We did not know how to. For the past 50 years, we&rsquo;ve just declined.&#8221; He pauses. &#8220;They took this country by force,&#8221; he says, with more than a touch of admiration. &#8220;If they came back, this time we&rsquo;d give them the country for free.&#8221;</p>

			<p>But the liberal white communists will never allow whites to come back and develop the Congo.  No matter how much blacks would want it.  Always remember, the liberals know what&rsquo;s best for all peoples, and whitey should have to pay for it.</p>

			<p>Well, I can believe this. I assure you though the Belgians aren&rsquo;t going anywhere near that place ever again.</p>
<p>I remember when the Congo got its independance. The Belgian king was there for the ceremonies and he got his cermonial sword taken right off him and stolen. </p>
<p>The Congolese went berserk. The Belgian army had to go in and rescue the Whites who&rsquo;d remained there after independance.</p>
<p>It really got bad there. </p>

			<p>Is this a peek at the future?  In the next century will there be places all ove the globe where non-Whites will actually wish they hadn&rsquo;t killed, raped, or stolen from us to the point at which we left?</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t hold my breath (100 years IS a long time), but the next time I&rsquo;m in an argument with some starry-eyed, Obama-is-godly, totally-lost soul, I&rsquo;ll gently shake my head and utter that cute little French phrase, &#8220;Everything is par terre&#8221;.  </p>
<p>After all that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;ll be in this country after the next presidential election </p>

			<p>This seems to be happening in a lot of African countries (like Zimbabwe and even Nigeria that was paying whites to move there and farm).  I remember an article a couple of years ago about Richmond, VA and how all or most of the non-elected people who ran the city were white and they were appointed by blacks and the blacks basically said they didn&rsquo;t care who ran the city as long as there was no more corruption.  That right there might cause the demise (or lessening) of affirmative action, though I&rsquo;m sure white elitists (and black ones too) will try to keep it around.</p>

<p>The truth hurts. the same is true of american blacks and blacks everywhere in the world. Strict extremely limited quotas for immigrants from black countries need to be put in place immediately throughout the civilized world. </p>

			<p>LeBlanc, you are smarter than all the &#8220;suits&#8221; at the U.N. <br>
Two problems could be solved if only the Congolese people had the wherewithall to invite the displaced white farmers of Zimbabwe to relocate and make the land bloom. But, a world paralyzed by PC will allow everyone and everything to wither.</p>

			<p>  This should be forced reading for major universities to counter the perfectly politically correct communism now called PC which is the normal reading material at most universities in the USA. <br>
  Africa is falling backwards from the Congo to Kenya to South Africa which with it Africanization program has removed the whites from electricity management and cannot produce enough electric power to keep its mines running. Why is this ?  Read the original article and you will read what I have heard from other Africans.</p>

<p>Yes, but would they be worth having?</p>
<p>Would they be racially conscious and confident whites, who understand the natural order of colonial partnership, or mindlessly egalitarian  propaganda spewing white fools?  In short, would they be a bunch of worthlessly feckless white wretches, like Comrade Perry and FDR; or would they be great and daring white men, like Commodore Perry and TR? </p>
<p>So often, blacks and other nonwhites see our foolishness for what it is, but would likely not like the outcome if it suddenly changed, methinks. They want &ldquo;white men,&rdquo; to bring them a utopia or Western Civilization, but they don&rsquo;t realize that it can never come from or back through sniveling Marxists, who weep over &ldquo;the cruelties of the past&rdquo; and deny that they were anything other than that. Moreover, during the period of Western colonial dominance, the world was about 38% white and 62% nonwhite in terms of population; our knowledge and technology allowed for this, simply because deaths were now concentrated in the elderly population, and not our youth and newborns. Moreover, that dramatically astounding demographic shift toward an actual white plurality of the global population, allowed for our influences to spread to the nonwhite majority and buttress it at some levels. Unfortunately, at other levels, our technology and ability were ignored for the more &ldquo;appealing ideas&rdquo; regarding the &ldquo;universality&rdquo; of &ldquo;humanity.&rdquo; Thus, the colonial &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; went onto the &ldquo;dustbin of history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can that be achieved in a world again, where whites are so focused on &ldquo;equality&rdquo; and &ldquo;rights,&rdquo; while only 15% to 8% of the global population, that abortions and nonwhite &ldquo;immigrations&rdquo; are allowed? Can that better social order be achieved, when miscegenation and &ldquo;integration&rdquo; are worshiped, as better than Apartheid and racial purity laws?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t have the cake and eat it, especially if no one can even figure out how to bake it!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>Blacks cannot maintain ANY of the hallmarks of civilization without intensive aid from others, almost all of whom are white.  That&rsquo;s just the way things are and the pattern of collapse of all institutions followed by &#8220;going backward&#8221; as this person puts it will ALWAYS take place.</p>
<p>The absolute worst thing whites can do to blacks is allow blacks self determinism.  The truth is, without us, they will return to the stone age, and relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Likely, that is exactly what will happen over the next two to three generations as it becomes more and more obvious the other problem with blacks.  As a group, they are psychopathic, even evil.  When controlled by whites, they are incredibly crime prone inversely proportional to the amount of dominance we exercise over them.  When allowed to rule themselves, the most heinous evils take place&hellip;ritualistic murder, wide spread pedophilia, CANNIBALISM.  And there is the real threat that they may be exterminated by AIDS over the next 50 to 100 years.  Under the circumstances, the desire for whites to be separate will grow until it becomes an inevitable.</p>
<p>Simply put, blacks contribute NOTHING to civilization except horror, so civilization doesn&rsquo;t want them.  Only whites were willing to even give them a chance at joining the modern world.  And our reward has been nothing but hatred, violence and a degradation of our very way of life.  Soon, that chance will be over and whites will insist on being separate.  Very quickly, blacks will return to a primitive state, if they survive at all.</p>

			<p>I say we give American-Africans $50,000 reparations in return for them renouncing their U.S. citizenship in the U.S. Embassy in the Congo. With the chains of whitey being dropped, the New African Man, with their higher than indiginous African IQ, should easily raise to the top of the social pile. Isn&rsquo;t time the American Africans, who proudly fly the Black Nationalist Flag in whitey&rsquo;s face, put their money where their mouth is?</p>

			<p>I like the photograph - something in me approves of the fact that the land returned to a relatively pristine natural condition, rather than being slashed and burned for farming, paved over for highways, and platted for real estate developments.  This area deserves to be set aside as a nature preserve, free from the depredations of Africans and Europeans alike.  </p>

			<p>      This piece reminds me of a science fiction novel I read<br>
once. The Earth is ruled by an Alien race who deem themselves<br>
utterly superior to Humans. And truthfully, they are far super-<br>
ior technologically, militarily and perhaps intellectually. But<br>
they get too complacent and the humans launch a rebellion and<br>
some of the Aliens get killed. And then without trying to fight,<br>
they leave. As they are preparing to leave, the protagonist, a<br>
domesticated human, is stopped by his master who says, &#8220;We are<br>
leaving of our own accord. You could not force us out&#8221;. The human<br>
says, &#8220;Why then&#8221;? The Alien replies, &#8220;Because you are unworthy&#8221;.</p>

			<p>       An interesting question-What to do if this was accepted<br>
knowledge? What&rsquo;s in it for us? Resources, both mineral and ag-<br>
ricultural. If we don&rsquo;t go in, someone else will. But of course<br>
it is a purely theoretical question-these facts wont be accepted<br>
and the disaster will continue as Blacks, Browns, and Yellows<br>
colonize the West. The very real danger is the onset of third<br>
world conditions in the West. I have an inescapable vision of<br>
Whites being hunted by Blacks through cold, trash strewn streets<br>
of our fallen civilization. Perhaps even hunted for their flesh.<br>
      But perhaps in the Next Civilization, Whites will know and<br>
never make the same mistakes as we have so many times before.</p>

			<p>Have a look at this documentary by one of our most respected and honoured reporters here in the UK.  It&rsquo;s about South Africa and in it one black says he would prefer a white government.  Notice the twisted words and bias of our illustrious reporter as he says to the camera he didn&rsquo;t believe the man really wanted to go back to the old regime.  Well, no, he didn&rsquo;t say that, he said &#8216;a white government&rsquo;.  Also observe how the reporter, without any statistical evidence, blames appartheid for the violence.  Note that many of today&rsquo;s criminals were children or babies under appartheid.  He also doesn&rsquo;t mention the number of immigrant criminals.  It&rsquo;s all typical BBC mind control.</p>

			<p>National Security Study Memorandum 200 was completed in 1974 under war criminal Henry Kissinger then National Security Advisor. The gist of the report was that growing third world populations were a major threat to U.S. i.e. Bankster/Corporate interests.  The white civilizations in Rhodesia, South Africa, and other African countries were providing conditions to good for the natives and the black populations soared.  So the whites had to go, by hook or by crook.  It is also much easier for the Banksters to exploit natural resources without pesky middle class Christian whites in the way demanding rights and decent living conditions.</p>

they leave. As they are preparing to leave, the protagonist, a <br>
domesticated human, is stopped by his master who says, &ldquo;We are <br>
leaving of our own accord. You could not force us out&rdquo;. The human <br>
says, &ldquo;Why then&rdquo;? The Alien replies, &ldquo;Because you are unworthy&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>Sounds just like 1940s Indonesia (against the Dutch), 1950s Kenya with the Mau Mau, 1960s Algeria (versus the French), and 1970s Rhodesia (Zimbabwe).</p>
<p>And South Africa right now.</p>

			<p>This is just so predictable. Look at Rhodesia - the breadbasket of Africa. Safe, productive with education and healthcare for the blacks.</p>
<p>Then it became Zimabwe and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Its not just Africa. Look at all the other colonies. The West Indies was a paradise but no longer.</p>
<p>Not only that. When I grew up in Birmingham (the real one in England) it was an industrious, community minded, weathly city where you could walk the streets in safety.</p>
<p>Now the inner city is overrun with blacks and Pakistani&rsquo;s. The consequence is that it is run down, dirty, violent and full of scrounging, unproductive immigrants.</p>
<p>Eventually even the stupid liberals will figure it out.</p>

			<p>The same could be said of black-controlled American cities like Detroit and Philadelphia.  They&rsquo;ve gone &#8220;third-world&#8221; to the core.</p>
<p>Blacks working in Detroit&rsquo;s city-county building downtown are a sight to see.  As inefficient and corrupt as that town is, the employees, and I use that term lightly, are always walking about in &#8220;ghetto chic&#8221; finery.  I swear, they must spend the bulk of their paychecks on clothes. Demonstrations of fashion finery are the order of the day, and the more garish, the better. I defy any non-black to try to keep up with them in the flashy duds department, not that any non-black would want to.</p>
<p>Government money given to blacks will always be wasted be it here or in the Congo. That&rsquo;s &#8220;always&#8221;, from Mayor Nagin to Brutha Kwamee who heads up DIEtroit.  Blacks love elevating their politicians to potentates, and disregard the decay around them.  As a race, their priorities demand that &#8220;profilin&rsquo;&#8221; be the first order of the day, with substance somewhere down at the bottom. </p>
<p>The Congolese asked for it, now they have it.  A true, &#8220;Chocolate Country&#8221;.  </p>

How&rsquo;s about all the blacks, muslims, and other non-whites in Europe go back to Africa, India or the Middle East?  OR!

			<p>National Security Study Memorandum 200 was completed in 1974 under war criminal Henry Kissinger then National Security Advisor. The gist of the report was that growing third world populations were a major threat to U.S. i.e. Bankster/Corporate interests. The white civilizations in Rhodesia, South Africa, and other African countries were providing conditions to good for the natives and the black populations soared. So the whites had to go, by hook or by crook. It is also much easier for the Banksters to exploit natural resources without pesky middle class Christian whites in the way demanding rights and decent living conditions.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a simple explanation for that: the liberal establshment is simply that confident that it&rsquo;s eviscerated whitey sufficiently that he&rsquo;ll never dare to *suggest* bringing civilization back to Africa. They don&rsquo;t mind a bit publishing the article in 2008   &mdash;   in fact, it&rsquo;s probably a form of bragging.

			<p>The Belgians behaved bestially but then, so did most of the continental European colonialist nations, which is par for the course for a bunch of nations that haven&rsquo;t won any wars in centuries and have needed the Nordo-Celtic nations to bail them out time and again. We should have left the Africans alone for another million years or so before trying to civilise them. That said, with all due respect to our American cousins, much of the blame for the break-up of the British Empire can be laid at your door, my friends. I&rsquo;m not saying this in any spirit of animosity. Regarding Africa in general, Sierra Leone proved that they need the white man. Not just any white man but the British (and the Irish). My former regiment (Parachute Regiment) got rid of their gangsters and &#8220;rebels&#8221; very quickly indeed and the SL government asked Blair&rsquo;s government in London if SL could come back to the fold. Well, Blair &amp; Co were too busy pandering to your Neocons and their WASP puppets to pay much heed. But not all the Africans are mad, machete-waving baboons. Look at the Tanzanians when Mugabe expelled hundreds of white farmers from Rhodes&hellip;oops&hellip;Zimbabwe recently: they welcomed the Rhodesians with open arms and gave them all jobs running farms because the locals weren&rsquo;t up to the task. </p>

			<p>I think we should let Africa go back to a pristine pre-stone age and be preserved for us to enjoy, study, and observe. Let the blacks go back to their proper life of eating, breeding, dancing, small farming, hunting, and gathering.</p>
<p>I would truly enjoy vacationing in a beautiful ancient world with unspoiled unusual flora, fauna, and native inhabitants. I don&rsquo;t want the natives to serve me during my visit but I wouldn&rsquo;t mind visiting their villages. I could buy a goat or grain and give it to them in exchange for taking photos and watching their tribal celebrations.</p>
<p>This would be paradise. </p>

			<p>Whoever made the anonymous post at 9:08 PM on Feb. 14 has a point. While American blacks lag a full standard deviation behind whites in IQ, they enjoy a similar advantage over their African brethren. If they were to move to Africa <i>en masse</i> they could be running the place within a year. As the old proverb says, &#8220;In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;d better hurry up and skedaddle before the Chinese   &mdash;   with an even higher median IQ than whites   &mdash;   move in and take over in just a week or two.</p>

<p>The population of the DRC was 37 million in 1990.  Today it is 54 million.  Never underestimate the power of human fertility.  Black African countries typically have fertility rates per woman of 6 to 8.  That overwhelms the high death rates from war, disease, and starvation.

			<p>&#8220;but, the Congo basin is a petri dish for every sort of disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if there was a white government of Congo,and a mass colonization of whites to the Congo, white doctors would use their expertise to fight all these awful diseases that seriously hurt and kill black Africans.</p>
<p>Whites would use their expertise to provide clean drinking water, electricity, hospitals, schools and other benefits for the Congo&rsquo;s native blacks.</p>
<p>White farmers would bring back the plantations, white industrialists would bring in industries, and white entrapeneurs could even form partnerships with willing blacks, all of which would bring jobs and prosperity to Congo&rsquo;s native black African population.</p>
<p>Ironically, under white rule of the Congo, white human rights activists would work to correct any human rights abuses done to Congo&rsquo;s natives by a white government, as well work to stop human rights abuses done to Africans by Africans, themselves.</p>
<p>Some enviromentalists reading this may disagree and argue that such mass white colonization of the Congo bring great enviromental destruction.  Ironically, under white rule of the Congo, there would be white environmentalists who would work to set aside large areas of the Congo rainforest for preservation, fight to curb pollution of the Congo River, start employing game wardens to save wild animals from overhunting for bushmeat, give the native black Congolese economic incentive for wildlife conservation.  None of which exists at this present time in the Congo.</p>
<p>If I were a native black African Congolese, I would be on my knees praying for white rule to come to the Congo! </p>

			<p>Ross,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got things tied up nicely in a nice little package. I assure you though, the only way to make your ideas work would be to rule as the Belgian king Leopold did during the time of the Congo Free State. Which was total brutality. Short of that, you would have anarchy. It&rsquo;s unfortunate, but that&rsquo;s the only way.<br>
Only after &#8220;order&#8221; was implemented, could your ideas be put into practice. Too bad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my humble opinion anyway.</p>

			<p>One day while browsing in a favorite bookstore, I came across a small paperback written by a black African scholar about Africa&rsquo;s problems. He concluded his work by warning his fellow Africans that they should solve their problems before things became so bad that the populace started begging the colonialists to come back. The nub of the final sentence though, was that he was worried &hellip; worried that people would beg to be recolonized, <i>and nobody would be interested!</i></p>
<p>It seems that reality has caught up with what I thought at the time was hyperbole. </p>

<p>It could be done! Congo could be the envy of Africa! The questions are: <br>
1.Will any level-minded person(s) step forward to take the offer?<br>
2.Will the natives indeed hand them the reins of power? (Though I&rsquo;m betting they will. Even wild animals can be made docile by hunger, and much more so for humans.)</p>

			<p>The truth is that sub-Sahara Africans are still totally dependant on the rusting remnants left by the Europeans from the colonial era that ended over half a century ago. This really hit home when I read an article about a major river in Africa where the Africans of that vast region were completely dependant for transportation on a few rusting colonial era ferries still remaining.</p>

			<p>White people have already been through this pattern similar to this:</p>
<p>1) Take over foreign land with armed forces<br>
2) Rule with iron fist, allow no dissent<br>
3) White do-gooder enablers launch movement for rights and greater liberties of the indigenous man<br>
4) Black representatives allowed say in governance under white rule<br>
5) Experiment succeeds, greater black control<br>
6) Country doing so well, white rulers shamed as being unnecessary and barbaric, forced to step down<br>
7) New black rulers declare dictatorship and launch campaign of genocide on old tribal enemies.  Barbarity, racism, corruption and sheer animality all reach new highs</p>

			<p>I have seen the same thing happen in the Mississippi Delta town of Greenwood,Ms. In the 50s and 60s when I was growing up there; this was a clean,thriving city with safe streets that were well maintained. The schools though segregated taught kids in black and white schools to the highest academic standards and even permitted prayer in class rooms. The city and county government, as well as school board was white operated. Today all these institutions are run by a &#8220;governing coalition&#8221; that can be euphnistically called  Hip Hop culture doin&rsquo; da hood&hellip;you know whad I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;? Today the schools have cops in the hallways, frequent stabbings and shootings not to mention other drug and crime issues. The city streets are unpaved for about 30 years and the few remaining whites live in a small section of town north of the river in uneasy dread. The local private economy that thrives are white owned and operated. The blacks run the &#8220;government&#8221; economy which as you may have guessed is a political pay out patronage to the right color group. Be it the Congo, Kenya Miss.Delta or Detroit the results are the same. Until Whitey comes out of his zombie sleep called, p.c. liberalism, it will only get worse for the whites and the entire planet. Civilization has been replaced with multiculturism and the world&rsquo;s forward march is now a disasterous retreat!</p>
