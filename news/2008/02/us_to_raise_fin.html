						<p>WASHINGTON &mdash;  The Bush administration said Friday that it plans to significantly raise fines for employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, part of a broader effort that includes improved border security after Congress failed to pass immigration-related legislation in 2007.</p>
<p>The hikes in employer fines will be the first since 1999. The new policy is the latest aimed at the most sensitive pressure point in illegal immigration: businesses that employ the workers.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has intensified raids on rogue companies in the last three years, prosecuting executives on criminal charges and arresting workers, who often use valid Social Security numbers, for identity theft.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The increased fines will take effect March 27. The minimum penalty will increase by $100, to $375. The maximum fine for a first-time offender will jump $1,000, to $3,200. And the maximum fine for repeated violations will rise $5,000, to $16,000. Fines are assessed on a per-person basis, so an employer with 10 illegal immigrants on staff would pay 10 fines.</p>

			<p>Good, start calling ICE and turning these parastical employers in. Taxes are way too high.</p>

			<p>Chicken feed no matter how you analyze it from an employer&rsquo;s point of view. A minor inconvenience, life is harsher for a white boy caught with a joint in his glove compartment.</p>

			<p>It will only work when the &#8220;Captains of Industry&#8221; hiring these illegal immigrants get a taste of the *&#8221;diversity&#8221;* the immigrants bring to America courtesy of the U.S. prison system.</p>
<p>Until then, &#8220;fines&#8221; are just another slap on the wrist.</p>

			<p>This is just a small start. Employers of illegals should be treated like drug dealers. Prison time is a minimal penalty.</p>

<p>Wow. I&rsquo;ll bet offending employers are shaking in their boots now.</p>

			<p>As everyone on this forum probably knows, fines alone are ineffective and dirtbag illegal alien employers will just consider fines &#8220;a cost of doing business&#8221;, and pay them even less. Fines need to be combined with good old social humiliation brought about by jail time. &#8220;Hi Christine, we haven&rsquo;t seen John lately,&#8221; &#8220;oh, he&rsquo;s in jail.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Up the anti to at least $5000 for first offenders&hellip;but I doubt is anything will really be done&hellip;.big business can do what ever they damn well please&hellip;most are on a first name basis with G W and his old man!</p>

			<p>Oooooooohhhhh&hellip;..$100 fine.  Employers of illegal aliens must be shaking in their booties at the raw law n order tactics of the republican administration.</p>
<p>Completely inappropriate.  The minimum penalty should be 1 year of prison in general population.  Second offense, 10 years.</p>
<p>I guarantee that, once the punishment fits the crime, this nonsense will stop overnight.  CEO&rsquo;s of corporations laugh at a $100 fine.  To them, that&rsquo;s what they pay for lunch.  But a year in prison, in close contact with the people they are bringing in to our country?  They won&rsquo;t laugh at that.</p>

			<p>Up the anti to $10,000 per day and split the fine with whomever turned the employer in.</p>
<p>Put a 100% tax on goods from China and services from India and we could repeal the income tax.</p>
<p>Pull our troops out of Iraq and put them on the border with Mexico.</p>
<p>Cancel all benefits to illegals, including emergency room care and schools for their spawn. </p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t be too long before we had a Garden of Eden here. </p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what the fine or penalties are if you never prosecute anyone. Thanks to the current administration, employing illegal aliens carries a risk free, zero-prosecution  guarantee. </p>

			<p>It should be considered a serious crime to hire illegals not a slap on the wrist!!! Jail time and fines!!!</p>

			<p>This is a start.</p>
<p>This makes Bush slightly less evil.  I remember his &#8220;No immigration problems here&#8221; tour a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>I am thankful.</p>

			<p>They can raise the fines all they want, but it is not going to be effective if the laws aren&rsquo;t being enforced.  I work in an insurance office and we have four illegal immigrants that work here and they have been here for almost three years.  I called INS and informed them and they did not do anything.  I have called several governmental agencies and nothing has been done. I finally gave up and learned that we have been defeated and we need to accept that we are going to become the minorities which our own people are doing this to us.  I know believe that we are not the smartest people on earth.  We can&rsquo;t even preserve ourselves.  We are doing away with our won kind.  Now would the most intelligent people do that?  Perhaps the people with the more intelligence are the Mexicans, they are taking our country from us without firing a single shot and are doing nothing to stop them.  How sad and pathetic are people have become. </p>
