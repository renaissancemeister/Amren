<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 100 parents packed the meeting room at Alfred Bonnabel Academy Magnet High School in Kenner Tuesday to protest a sweeping redistricting plan in Jefferson Parish that aims to strike a better balance between black and white students on every campus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Virtually all the speakers were east bank residents concerned about the elimination of permits to allow children to attend schools outside their home districts.</p>
<p>Most were upset and very wary of the proposed consent decree and the redistricting that would ensue, particularly on the east bank.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jennifer Todd of Metairie, who has a child at Alice Birney Elementary School in Metairie, told board members her child was having nightmares at home and when she got a permit to change schools to Birney, the nightmares stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you are limiting my ability to put my children somewhere they can be happy and in a productive environment. You are discriminating against all children by not having a school system that allows each child the same opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said that if the board approves the consent order, she will be forced to leave the system and send her child to private school. &#8220;You will lose gifted children in the school system,&#8221; she said</p>
<p>Rebecca Chenault of Kenner, who has a child at Bissonet Plaza Elementary School, agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re giving me no choice but to take a second mortgage out on my home so I can send him to a private school. Please reconsider this.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But board memberes said they had little choice in many areas of the consent decree because it was required by law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another parent questioned why everything was decided behind closed doors. But board member Judy Colgan said the board had no control over that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were bound by a gag order to not talk about this to anyone, to constituents to parents to anyone. That was imposed on us. We didn&rsquo;t think that up.&#8221;</p>
