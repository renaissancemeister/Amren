<h1>Anti-Semitic Note Attacks Tenn. Lawmaker</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Woody Baird, AP, February 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) &mdash; Steve Cohen, a white congressman representing a mostly black district, is no stranger to political attacks tinged with race. A new political flier circulating in the district is forcing him to confront anti-Semitism, too.</p>
<p>The flier, which showed up in mailboxes this week, aims to rally black Christians to oppose Cohen because he&rsquo;s Jewish. &#8220;Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen and the Jews hate Jesus,&#8221; the flier reads in bold letters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The flier, which was also sent by mail to the Memphis Jewish Federation, included a contact name, the Rev. George Brooks, and a phone number in Murfreesboro, a town near Nashville and some 200 miles outside Cohen&rsquo;s district.</p>
<p>A woman who would only identify herself as a friend of Brooks answered a call to the number and said he was out of town. Repeated subsequent calls went unanswered and messages were unreturned.</p>
<p>Cohen easily won the 2006 general election in the heavily Democratic district, but he took a crowded primary with just barely 30 percent of the vote. Four black candidates split almost 60 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Cohen&rsquo;s most vocal opposition has come from critics arguing that the Memphis district, which is 60 percent black and 34 percent white, should have a black representative in Washington.</p>
<p>Cohen was challenged last year at a meeting of the Memphis Baptist Ministerial Association as being unable to represent the 9th District because of his race.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s not black, and he can&rsquo;t represent me. That&rsquo;s the bottom line,&#8221; one pastor told the local newspaper as the raucous meeting broke up.</p>
<p>The Rev. O.C. Collins, a member of the ministerial association, later invited Cohen to speak at his church as a way to apologize for the group&rsquo;s &#8220;impoliteness.&#8221;</p>
