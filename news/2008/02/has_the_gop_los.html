						<p>There&rsquo;s a dilemma brewing among Latino voters: If they support Sen. John McCain, long seen as a moderate Republican on immigration reform, they also must deal with his party&rsquo;s tough approach toward the hot button issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unlike his original immigration proposal, which included a path to citizenship, McCain said as president, he would secure the borders first before offering other ways to deal with illegal immigration.</p>
<p>In a border state like Texas, which holds its Republican primary March 4, the large Latino population could help McCain reach the magic number of 1,091 delegates to win the Republican nomination.</p>
<p>But the influential conservative base of the party has taken a hard-line approach toward immigration &mdash; and that is not sitting well with Latinos.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rodriguez (the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez), a conservative, is president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.</p>
<p>As president, Rodriguez, of Puerto Rican descent, has ties to 18,000 Latino Evangelical Churches. He is young and powerful. And he is not happy. He calls immigration reform a debacle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican Cuban-American from Miami, admits the GOP has turned off many Latino voters.</p>
<p>But Ros-Lehtinen has faith in McCain, and believes he can bring them back.</p>
<p>&#8220;In John McCain we have someone who can expand our base. President Bush the father, President Bush the son, did it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They got a good chunk. President Reagan did as well, a good chunk of the Hispanic vote. But we&rsquo;ve lost that now because of that nasty rhetoric.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Latinos need persuading on a whole range of issues &mdash; and immigration is not always No. 1.</p>
<p>Puerto Rican-born Marytza Sanz, a Democrat, is the founder of Latino Leadership in Orlando, Florida, which registers Latinos to vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that it&rsquo;s more than the immigration situation. Right now our community is desperate with the economy,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That may not help McCain, who has been criticized by former GOP presidential rivals for not having enough economic credentials to turn around the nation&rsquo;s sagging economy.</p>

			<p>The Great Dr. Samuel T. Francis studied this, and while he found that Republicans never get the majority of the Hispanic vote, &#8220;stronger&#8221; Republicans like Reagan get a little more than &#8220;weaker&#8221; ones like Dole.</p>

			<p>If Clinton gets the nomination, I think the hispanics will vote for her.  If it&rsquo;s Obama, I don&rsquo;t think alot of hispanics would vote for a black guy.  They probably would give their votes to McCain since he&rsquo;s promised that no one would get deported.</p>

			<p>The Republican Party doesn&rsquo;t even deserve to be around. In fact, I believe the masks are off where both the Republican and Democratic Party are concerned. Most people realize the game now. Whatever the elite want is carried out by the whores in both parties. The disagreements between them are all just pretend, play acting, then when the pretending is over, the elites always get what they want and the whores skip off to play golf together. Today President Kennedy would be to the right of regular conservatives.</p>

			<p>That loyal Republican voter just trying to get out of every Hispanic body is a total delusion that the Republicans suffer from. Hispanics (with the possible exception of Cubans, who are basically White) are not and never have been Republican-inclined voters. This is a total canard.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I think that it&rsquo;s more than the immigration situation. Right now our community is desperate with the economy,&rdquo; she said&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;As usual the Latinos are clueless about the economy. Do they think importing more cheap labor will help lower and middle class Hispanics increase their wages or the number of Jobs.</p>

			<p>     The Hispanics are not a solid bloc. Ask a Cuban if a Mexican is his equal. Ask a Puerto Rican if someone from the Dominican Republic is as smart as he is. They don&rsquo;t particularly like each other. It would be wrong to lump all Hispanics under the same banner. Most Hispanics will vote for the Welfare Party, period.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Has the GOP Lost Latino Voters?&#8221;  </p>
<p>How about publishing an article with the long overdue headline:</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the GOP lost the White Male Voters?&#8221;</p>
<p>If not, then why not?  Exactly WHAT have these backstabbing, treasonous, lying rats done over the last 40 odd yaars to DESERVE to keep or preserve loyalty from Whites, and from White males in particular?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at what the GOP has been selling to their #1 must-have voting block, okay?</p>
<p>1.  Lie to us on the campaign trail - repeatedly tell us whatever you think we want to hear.</p>
<p>2.  Once elected, begin to immediately do everything in their power to ram the knife blade in and out of the backs of the very people who voted for you.</p>
<p>3.  Remove that knife from our backs only long enough to try to pass amnesty legislation which will cram millions of Mexicans, millions of Aids-Infected Bantu Somalis, or millions of African Barundi refugees, and millions of depleted uranium infected Iraqis down our throats - and once here, put all these aliens on the public dole and then jack up our taxes even higher to force us to pay for all the living, education and health care expenses for all these non-whites.  Removing precious financial resources from white families that will NOT be available for their living expenses, education expenses, or health care expenses.</p>
<p>4. Gleefully pass legislation and write laws that accelerate the outsourcing and off-shoring of good paying American jobs to the Third World, which primarily affects white, middle class males - while at the same time, pushing these toxic, anti-white, Cultural Marxist Diversity programs at home for the few decent jobs that remain, which puts every non-White (former slave or not) in line AHEAD of the unemployed white males - who are becoming increasingly desperate for jobs needed to support themselves and their families.</p>
<p>5. Collaborate in the deliberate, malicious, and downright evil campaign of the neo-cons to LIE our nation into wars which are NOT in the best interests of America, wars which see 70% plus of the casualties concentrated among naive, and far too trusting and gullible, WHITE MALES who have a disturbing habit of volunteering for combat related assignments to fight in wars that are helping to accelerate the elitist&rsquo;s genocide program against Whites worldwide.</p>
<p>6.  Ignore and try to marginalize and destroy a fine statesmen like Ron Paul, a true conservative, and a true patriotic man - and elevate instead a Marxist leaning, ant-white, anti-gun, corrupt stooge for the same pack of liars who lied us into Iraq to the top &rsquo; GOP spot&rsquo; - thereby guaranteeing we will see more of the same, as outlined in 1-5 above.</p>
<p>And, the GOP is worrying about losing the Hispanic vote?  </p>
<p>The GOP, as long as it remains &#8216;Neo-Conned&rsquo; - is a party that deserves to be completely and totally destroyed, root and branch.   And,  any white male who continues to support it under the current conditions - is a moron of monumental magnitude.  This party fully intends to seek our demographic group&rsquo;s subjugation by reducing us to a minority in our own nation, and ultimately, they seek our genocide.</p>
<p>And, none of this is by coincidence.</p>

			<p>The traitors in the Democratic Party are rarely equaled for sheer hatred of the country of their birth.  But CNN stands ready to exceed them in their desire to destroy us.  Why?  I&rsquo;ll never understand it.  CNN made Ted Turner a fabulously rich man. Why does his network seem gleeful in the coming balkanization of America.   </p>
<p>As for McCain, it will serve him right to lose as Latinos desert en masse to the Donkey Party, which after all is their natural home.  Being as the Dems are the party of dependencey, welfare, single moms, high school dropouts, diliquents, abortionists, drug users and gang bangers, all of which the Latino immigrants are vastly over-represented in as a class, rivaling even the disfunction of the black community.  Amazingly they got there without slavery or Jim Crow.  </p>
<p>As for the ability of the Latino voters to think, it appears low based on this article.  Latino voters, who are presumably ciitizens, if they really are &#8220;desperate with the economy&#8221; as Marytza claims should be more anxious than anyone to stem the flow of illegals from Mexico.   Why would Puerto Ricans, who all have US Citizenship, support millions of Mexicans flowing across the border to take their low-skill jobs by working for less, off the books, and without benefits?  </p>
<p>Perhaps McCain should run special commercials in Spanish explaining that unfettered illegal immigration hurts legal Hispanic voters worse than any other group of voters (except perhaps Blacks, who always end up least likely to be hired in competitive situations due to their particular social pathologies which the majorities of Mexicans do not seem to share.) </p>

			<p>&#8220;But the influential conservative base of the party has taken a hard-line approach toward immigration   &mdash;   and that is not sitting well with Latinos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why would it not sit well with Hispanics who are citizens?  I mean, didn&rsquo;t they swear to uphold the constitution and dedicate their loyalty to the US?  If they were born here isn&rsquo;t that assumed, as it is with white citizens?</p>
<p>If they want the country swamped with illegals, overburdening all our infrastructure, then they have no loyalty for their country as white Americans do.  Their loyalty is to their race.  It&rsquo;s a racial issue with them, and race trumps citizenship oaths, loyalty to one&rsquo;s country, etc.</p>
<p>In other words, they&rsquo;re racists, as the term is erroneously  used nowadays. They want this country to accept people they regard as racial kin, because they would rather live among them than citizens native to the US.</p>
<p>And the media who fail to point that out are a greater threat to the country than the illegal parasites.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>

			<p>Imagine the French politicians worrying that they may lose German vote in 1941 when Hitler&rsquo;s troops were marching on Paris? (Many of those who did were tried and executed after the WWII.)</p>

			<p>This is why our nation is heading towards a great split.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter where in the world you came from.  America is sovereign and can not be ruled by foreigners or their surrogates.  When I watch Univision all I see is a heavily weighted thrust to legalize Latinos.  It is the same with East Indians and other foreigners.  We have been raped by foreigners.  Tell them to go home.  </p>

 It&rsquo;s remarkable that this article says nothing about McCain&rsquo;s<br/>
prospective opponent, Barack Obama. His vote percentages<br/>
among Hispanic voters in the primaries have been abysimal.<br/>
This is the flip side of the black votes he gets. Multi-<br/>
culturalism promotes ethnic voting, as well as ethnic-<br/>
consciousness in every other facet of life. Hispanics<br/>
may not vote for McCain, but most would rather stay<br/>
home on election day than vote for a black.</p>

I understand that in Miami, the percentage of Hispanics republicans is falling.</p>
<p>The republic party has been hoping (or dreaming) that over the generations, Hispanics would become republicans. It appears over time, they become democrats. Courting and pandering to Hispanics has done nothing to secure the base. At this point, republicans can&rsquo;t simply abandon Hispanics because they need to retain even a sliver of the minority to win increasingly tight elections. Watching for increasing levels of pandering.<br/>

			<p>Who cares? </p>
<p>John McCain is the last gasp of the old guard in the Republican party. </p>
<p>Pretty soon Republicans are going to be on their hands and knees begging whites for forgiveness.</p>
<p>What Hispanics think is totally irrelevant. </p>
<p>The future of the Republican party (and America) belongs to racially-conscious whites.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come to a point in America where EVERY issue is a RACIAL issue. And it is now only a matter of time before whites start thinking in explicitly racial terms. </p>
<p>You can already see this happening. It&rsquo;s there just below the surface. </p>

<p>You are correct.  I would like to point out that we are getting back depleted uranium infected American G.I.&rsquo;s from Iraq and Afganistan, who are dying in the thousands after the GOP/USDOD throws them out as being no longer useful to their plans for world conquest.  I have seen figures that as many as 189,000 GIs have died or are dying from radiation poisoning acquired in Iraq.  And these numbers are not counted as being combat deaths.  More LIES from the GOP and Dems&hellip;</p>

			<p>The GOP can certainly get about 50% of the Hispanic vote in this election. They won about 40% in 2004 and over half of Hispanics in California voted for Schwarzenegger for governor in 2003.</p>
<p>McCain will pander and hoot about Hispanic family values and how he supports immigration, affirmative action and bilingual education. A few conservative whites will grumble but almost all will vote for him in the fall.</p>
<p>I learned my lesson in 2000. Whites/conservatives will always pull the lever for the GOP as there will always be a Clinton, Kerry, Gore or Obama who is supposedly &#8220;worse than [fill in the blank with a Republican liberal].&#8221;</p>
<p>Until we consistently vote third party we will get   &mdash;   and deserve   &mdash;   leftist Republicans who take our votes for granted.</p>

			<p>Hispanics,  are basically the parasites living off our economy. As such, you know they&rsquo;re going to VOTE for whoever promises them the biggest cut of the undeserved, unearned pie.</p>
<p>In other words, like the criminal, freeloading types they are, they will sell themselves (THEIR VOTES) to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>It might be noted the Hispanics   &mdash;   Cubans, Puerto Ricans, South Americans, and most certainly, the damned Mexicans are all bitterly envious of White Americans&rsquo; success and the great country we built. Just as they are aware, as Hispanics, they&rsquo;ll never be able to copy what we built in their own countries. </p>
<p>Thus, like so many hungry rats, you watch them streaming across the border in droves. Traitor McCain (you can take that term accurately in more than one sense)   &mdash;   will promise these criminal parasites amnesty to buy their votes. Traitor McCain, of course, having his campaign heavily subsidized by the large farming corporations in Arizona and the other grower states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same old tale   &mdash;   the whores in Congress   &mdash;   House OR Senate, will sell themselves, their support to the lobby groups and corporate contributors and &#8220;to hell with what the American citizens want or need.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Latinos (in large part) are never going to vote Republican.  It&rsquo;s all based on economics, and as with many things, that gets back to IQ.  Those with higher IQs, generally speaking, succeed and make more money.  Those with low IQs don&rsquo;t, and rely on government assistance, and that means voting Democrat.</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics, having lower IQs will always vote Democrat.</p>
<p>As long as there are still enough Whiteys around to pay enough taxes to support the various social welfare programs, Blacks and Hispanics will continue vote Democrat.  As soon as we are permanently demographically displaced by Hispanics, they will turn to ultra right, militaristic governments.</p>
<p>I have a bad feeling that horrible upheaval is coming, and in the not distant future.  We are at once despised by non-whites, and at the same time they are dependent upon us.</p>
<p>The host organism can only abide so many parasites before it dies.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s gonna take a lot more than a few election results. Personally I&rsquo;m sceptical that the will exists to fix this, or much else.  And obviously any fix at this point would exclude places like Southern California, which are way beyond redemption.  It ain&rsquo;t comming back to the USA, that&rsquo;s for sure. </p>

			<p>Luke said it well.  Nothing to add there.</p>
<p>After this election, the GOP is dead.  Whites MUST go elsewhere.<br/>
We have no voice, and we no longer suffer under the delusion that either party will ever stand for the founding principles, or truly care about OUR concerns.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t just color that keeps the blacks and the hispanics from assimilating into the majority culture or respecting the founding principles that made this country great and wealthy.  It&rsquo;s culture.  Those two groups are destructive to the founding culture, and therefore to the underlying economic engine which produced the wealth&hellip;.hard work, ethical and lawful behavior, cohesive community, similar values, and identity as Americans without a damn hyphen.  The very fact that they hyphenate their identity as African-Americans or Hispanic-Americans indicates clearly their innate divisiveness and refusal to assimilate AS Americans&hellip;.and an identity with something other than the principles of individual liberty and Republican government (not the political party) dependent on individual identity and achievement.</p>

			<p>It is irrelevant to me whether Republicans win any Hispanic votes.  The Republicans are self-seeking plutocrats.  They care nothing for their fellow white middle class citizens.  What more proof do you need than to look at the legislation they&rsquo;ve proposed vis a vis open borders and amnesty?  And what about their caving to the left on affirmative action and education?  Republicans are useless to us and must be isolated and made powerless.  They will always be around, but we must make sure they no longer gain power.  Under no circumstances should white middle class people vote Republican in the future.</p>

			<p>American &ldquo;latinos&rdquo; HATE immigrants. Why? Because, most of them are criminals. None of them speak english and almost all of them come to live in our communities. Guess who they choose as the victims for their crimes? Whites? Don&rsquo;t bet on it.</p>

<p>Good point. I have had many friends of hispanic hertitage in my life. But they were Americans, not &#8220;latinos&#8221;. Hell, most did not speak speak spanish at all. I never even thought about the differnece until all of these invaders came and the race grievance groups (LULAC, La RAZA, etc) started pointing out AND encouraging the differences, not the similarities. Look, any moron can see that allowing unfettered immigration of millions (legal or illegal) hurts the lower and middle class Americans the most. Especially, when the vast majority of the invaders are uneducated, non-English speaking, hispanics, who head straight to hispanic communities for cover. They either depress wages further or start a crime spree (something that is prevalent in the culture they fled). So how does that help Americans of hispanic descent? They don&rsquo;t call the GOP the &#8220;stupid party&#8221; for nothing. These immigrants will gravitate toward the party that promises them the most stuff. Take from the undeserving American and give to the poor minority. Hey, easy work if you can get it. And the Dems will eventually deliver as the &#8220;cliche old Americans&#8221; majority is replaced by the new immigrants. Unless something changes, we will see much of the US &#8220;nationalized&#8221; by the gov&rsquo;t in the next 50 years. For the betterment of our society, and us, of course.</p>

			<p>The GOP has been abusing mainstream white conservatives for so long it is a wonder anyone at all votes for them.  Does anyone remember what happened to Curious George&rsquo;s father after he broke his promise to not raise taxes, and then signed an executive order banning the importation of military-lookalike rifles?</p>
<p>Real conservatives stayed home or voted for that kook, Ross Perot.</p>
<p>Real conservatives are not going to vote for an amnesty candidate who is ideologically indistinguishable from a liberal democrat.  Many of us are frustrated, and sick and tired of the continual feeling we&rsquo;ve been had by a party that pays absolutely no attention to the needs of its core constituents: us.</p>
<p>I think a ticket with Hillary and Obamalamadingdong on it would be perfect.  Not only is it very likely, but these two freaks are our best near-term chance of having a civil war.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a total red herring to say that Republicans lose among ALL Latinos when they crack down (or purport to) on immigration.  Legal Latinos are some of the most adamant about enforcement, because they know what&rsquo;s coming over the border.  </p>

&#8220;..force us to pay for all the living, education and health care expenses for all these non-whites. Removing precious financial resources from white families that will NOT be available for their living expenses, education expenses, or health care expenses&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Luke:</p>
<p>Very good, important post.</p>
<p>What angers me so much about this situation is that by having ALL living expenses paid for, Third World colonists don&rsquo;t have to have a governor on their breeding practices.  </p>
<p>A full ride, courtesy of mostly White tax-payers (while the invaders deal in a cash-based economy), allows them to have many more children than they would otherwise be able to afford (remember that old tired slogan &#8216;It&rsquo;s for the children!&rsquo;  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m going to go postal the next time I hear that).</p>
<p>Because our wretched government forces us to support Third World (and even what I would call Fourth World from Africa) colonists, WE, the PRODUCERS, the INNOVATORS must limit the size of our families to what we can afford  &mdash;   none, one, two children at the most.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder we Whites are being overwhelmed by non-Whites?</p>
<p>What will happen when the tax base disappears as is happening in S. California?</p>
<p>And as you wrote:  &#8220;&hellip; none of this is by coincidence&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Good points, certainly! Clinton, Obama, not to mention at piece of excrement, Ted Kennedy or his peer, McCain   &mdash;   all are FOR amnestry, FOR open borders and FOR bring in as many immigrants via H1B visas as possible   &mdash;   \</p>
<p>I concur readily with readers pointing out the lack of genuine difference between the Republicans OR Democrats   &mdash;   either party being only too willing to sell out the American Middle Class. </p>
<p>But give an honest answer to this question: Would YOU REALLY be able to stomach another Billary (Hillary PLUS Bill) Clinton Administration?? Or worse yet, an Obama Administration. Obama, with about as much substance as a rainbow. A man who boasted of being pro-Amnesty, pro-open borders. A man who would open the doors to probably a MILLION MORE AFRICANS   &mdash;   from Kenya, Somalia, Burrundi, and other pestholes. Who in all likelihood would also push that coveted reparations through congress.</p>

			<p>  Thanks to Presidente Jorge Boosh, he has poured enough mexicans into this country, whom btw, always vote democrat, to seal the fate of the republican party. There will never be another republican president in this country until it breaks into several different countries. The United States, as a whole, is doomed. It will break up as did the Soviet Union. Along ethnic lines. I think the whites will control the northern states, the blacks will control the southern states, and the hispanics will control the western states. Three separate countries, with the northern states still feeding and defending the other states to keep them from invading them. Personally, I would leave this country now if there was any better place for white people to go. There isn&rsquo;t any such place. We, as a race, have sealed our own doom. White men are content as long as they have football and beer. Enuff said.</p>

<p>And thank God for that.  I&rsquo;ve done with the Republican party.  The mistake that conservatives made was in believing that the Republican party is a conservative party.  It is not, and never has been.  It did, for a time, act like it cared about our concerns.  But it did not really.  The republican party exists only to slavishly serve the interests of the wealthy.  And while I do not like socialism, I also don&rsquo;t believe that I share the same interests with the rich.  We need a new party - an explicitly conservative (even reactionary) party.</p>

			<p>OK, those who have spoken up are agreed that the GOP is pretty much a dinosaur.  I don&rsquo;t think the US is ready for either a convicted felon in the White House or a Japanese First Lady, so who&rsquo;s going to run?  Jared Taylor would be my first choice, with Tom Chittum as his running mate.</p>
