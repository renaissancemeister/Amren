						<p>JENA, La. &mdash; A defendant in the so-called &#8220;Jena Six&#8221; case that led to a huge civil rights demonstration here last year now faces an assault charge in Texas for a school fight, his mother said.</p>
<p>Bryant R. Purvis, 19, now living in the Dallas area, was charged with assault causing bodily injury. The charge is a misdemeanor, with a possible fine of up to $4,000 fine and a possible jail sentence of no longer than one year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tina Jones, Purvis&rsquo; mother, said her son got into an altercation with another student at Hebron High School early Wednesday after he was told that the student had vandalized his car the night before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish he could just get in a place where he could walk away from the situation,&#8221; Jones said of her son. &#8220;I understand he gets frustrated. But he needed to walk away from this situation, being that he&rsquo;s already in a situation. It&rsquo;s very frustrating and upsetting to have to go through so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Soon after Purvis&rsquo; arrest, Jones said she sent him to live with his uncle, Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Jason Hatcher, so he could stay out of trouble and out of the limelight.</p>
<p>Purvis had stayed out of the spotlight for most of the year, but did appear on Black Entertainment Television&rsquo;s Hip-Hop Awards. Purvis and fellow defendant Carwin Jones helped present the Video of the Year award during the October awards show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He currently faces charges of aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy to commit the same. If convicted of both charges, he faces a maximum sentence of 22 1/2 years in prison.</p>

<p>The world is a big place but not large enough to find a spot for this thug-in-development to avoid trouble.  </p>
<p>The aggrieved, misunderstood lad&rsquo;s mother can acquire a nasty case of carpal tunnel using MapQuest and she and sonny will never locate that idyllic place unless there&rsquo;s a town called self-control.    </p>
<p>Why do I think young Purvis&rsquo; next actual locale might be a maximum security prison or the obituaries?</p>

			<p>Why does all this stuff seem to happen around me? Purvis attacked a student at Hebron High School in Carrollton, just north of Farmers Branch, about one mile from my house. As usual, the article describes Purvis attacking &#8220;another student&#8221;. Of course, it&rsquo;s possible he attacked another African or a mexican, but Hebron High School is one of the city&rsquo;s newest high schools, just a few years old.  It&rsquo;s in &#8220;north&#8221; Carrollton, in Denton County. For those around here, that means the still predominantly White part of Carrollton, which, otherwise, has been overrun with mexicans.</p>
<p>Just a day or so ago, friends in Germany sent me a German language travel magazine for northwest Germany. I lived there myself about 20 years ago.  Very little crime. And no blacks, back then, or even middle easterners, to speak of. A real community, unlike my hometown, where blacks and latins assassinate people almost at will. In the magazine, there was not one advertisement, not one photo, not one illustration were the people were not White.  I had almost forgotten &hellip; . Everyday, my American TV, newspapers, and magazines are filled with african, latin, and asian faces.  What a pleasure to see a world where everyone looks like me, in Germany, blue eyes, white, and utterly NORMAL and STABLE.</p>

<p>Stupid is as stupid does.  This black Forest Gump isn&rsquo;t quite as smart as the white one.</p>
<p>Hopefully, he&rsquo;ll get into at least one or two more fights before his first trial, and then maybe another burglary or two, unless, of course, that interferes with his plan for a home invasion.</p>

			<p>Why was he on that awards show?   Was he nominated for &#8220;Most popular unprovoked sneak attack on a white boy&#8221;?   Is he alone recognized, or does he have to share the prize with those others who jumped in to help him kick &amp; beat the unconscious victim?</p>
<p>Or is that another category, &#8220;Most popular improvisational group of thugs&#8221;?  Or do they perhaps not qualify, because there was nothing unpremeditated about it, and neither were any of that group of thugs unprepared to play their parts~</p>
<p>At least one thing is clear: What BET &amp; Hip-hop &#8220;culture&#8221; is all about. </p>
<p>It was inevitable that this guy would be facing charges again.  </p>

			<p>Well, what do you know?  The victim is another lanky white kid.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the link:<br>
<a href="http://cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/player/popup/?rn=4226712&amp;cl=6349978&amp;src=news" rel="nofollow">http://cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/player/popup/?rn=4226712&cl;=6349978&src;=news</a></p>
<p>Apparently this assault occurred in the cafeteria of a predominently white high school, which begs the question, &#8220;Why did whites not come to this victims defense&#8221;?  If a lone white kid jumped on a lone black kid in a predominently black school, the white kid would have been removed from that cafeteria on a stretcher.  Cases such as these are all the proof we need that if a race war were to ever break out between blacks and whites, we would lose, regardless of our 5-to-1 odds.  Most whites would run in fear or submit passively at the first signs of black aggression.  Even in cases where whites have overwhelming numbers in their favor, they would rather watch one of their own take a beating at the hands of a black than to come to his defense.  In fact, it seems that young white females have more testosterone nowadays than their white male peers, so is it any wonder then why white girls are increasingly turning away from these cowards?</p>

			<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first of the Jena 6 to get in trouble with the law since they assaulted Justin.  I want to hear an apology from Jackson and Sharpton and everyone who supported these thugs as &#8220;innocent victims of racism&#8221;, for doing so.</p>

			<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fantastic if the current victim in Texas filed a lawsuit against the Jena prosecutor for malpractice in not filing a hate crime charge against this loser in Jena case which would have thus prevented the victimization of the person in Texas? I know, these prosecutors probably have some kind of immunity but the publicity from just filing the suit would be worthwhile in my opinion. I think prosecutors should be held accountable for their actions like any other professional is.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In fact, it seems that young white females have more testosterone nowadays than their white male peers, so is it any wonder then why white girls are increasingly turning away from these cowards?&#8221; Cop</p>
<p>   It&rsquo;s not so much the fear of a beating, but the social, legal and sometimes media crucifixion that follow a physical defense against blacks that keeps many young white males on the sidelines. Why do the police have to watch how they treat violent black offenders? Because the controlled media and racial hucksters will crucify them for even the routine performance of police duties.</p>
<p>If blacks are always shown as victims in popular culture and school, how can they be perpetrators/aggressors? Blacks also usually attack in groups rather than one on one. You end up having to fight the whole gang (Jean 6) not just the individual. Still, whites will need to take a more aggressive stand to survive.<br>

			<p> 50 years ago as a young boy; I was told to always stand on my own two feet, fight my own battles, never ask for help from anyone and demand that everyone else live to those standards. This effectively creates a divide and conquer situation.Blacks, Hispanics and other groups see absolutely nothing wrong with gang mentality. Whites are held by American society to a much higher standard of morality, honesty, integrity and personal strength.<br>
 The problem with that is that when faced by hordes of maniacal blacks; one person doesn&rsquo;t stsnd a chance. With main stream media, the full force of the Federal Government and the unrelenting bashing of the liberal left on the white man plus the problems stated above the end of the white race is visible.</p>

			<p>People say a lot of derogatory things about young blacks. My question is this. Can so many be wrong?</p>

<p> Thank you for that link. This guy is just an out and out thug. His mugshot says more about him then any words ever could. As to why Whites don&rsquo;t act in group defense partly it is because of social conditioning, blacks are more violent and aggressive by their very nature and have very poor impulse controls. They will initiate violence over things most Whites just don&rsquo;t even consider important. They are very easily offended, always mulling over real and imagined grievances. They have something &#8220;to prove&#8221;. Also many Whites fear the legal consequences, especially in an environment where they are on the defensive for fear of being called &#8216;racist&rsquo;. Most Whites with decent families and good jobs have a lot more to lose then some aimless going nowhere in life black who has not and never will amount to much. Blacks have a lot less to lose and are more wiling to fight. </p>

<p>Your points and examples are well stated, and I can see where what you say could be true.  It certainly appears that our young boys are at such overwhelming odds from so many angles, they probably have been reduced to taking the stance of, &#8220;If you can&rsquo;t beat&rsquo;em, join&rsquo;em.&#8221;  A mere survival mechanism in the new multicultural, anti-white male world that they are forced to maneuver their way through.  And they&rsquo;re not even out of high school yet.  Looking at the presidential candidates that the media has selected for us, it doesn&rsquo;t look to get any better for them (or whites in general) over the next four years.</p>

			<p>&#8220;so he could stay out of trouble and out of the limelight.&#8221; So the result momma wanted was somehow going to be achieved by sending him to appear as a presenter at the BET awards and to live with one of the Dallas Cowboys? Amazing how these people think. </p>

			<p>If you read the arrest warrant on the Smoking Gun website you will see that he cowardly attacked his victim from behind without any warning. TYPICAL BLACK MALE COWARDICE. The guy is 6&rsquo;6&#8221; and he still hasn&rsquo;t got the guts to fight like a man. I predict every single one of the so-called &#8220;Jena 6&#8221; will end up in trouble again. They were never innocent victims, just thugs. </p>

			<p>Why did so many white liberals send this punk money for his defense when he has an uncle playing pro ball and must make at least 300k a year if not more.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Also many Whites fear the legal consequences, especially in an environment where they are on the defensive for fear of being called &lsquo;racist&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>As long as Whites let the fear of being called racist control them, they will continue to be bullied by blacks. <br>
Sadly, many of our White males have no concept of what a real man is. By real man I mean someone who will stand up for what is right and for principle, regardless of the consequences. (Which is the reason many of us women find it very difficult to find a man we can respect)</p>
