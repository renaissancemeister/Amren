</blockquote></p>
<p>CANADIANS now know the precise moment when radical anti-racism became a more powerful sociological toxin than racism itself: 7:55pm EST on Sept. 5, 2003. That is the date-stamp on a particularly vile posting, left by an anonymous user on the message board of the right-wing web site freedomsite.org (https://www.freedomsite.org/), attacking Canada&rsquo;s first black senator. It read as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only is Canadian Senator Anne Cools is a Negro, she is also an immigrant! And she is also one helluva preachy c*nt. She does NOT belong in my Canada. My Anglo-Germanic people were here before there was a Canada and her kind have jumped in, polluted our race, and forced their bullshit down our throats. Time to go back to when the women *** imports knew their place .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And that place was NOT in public!&#8221;</p>
<p>Horrible, shocking stuff. But even more shocking is the identity of the fellow whose electronic fingerprints were all over the message: famed Canadian human-rights lawyer Richard Warman.</p>
<p>Warman is a legend in anti-racism circles. A former member of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, he&rsquo;s launched countless complaints against right-wing extremists, and won almost all of them. But during proceedings surrounding one of Warman&rsquo;s 2003-era complaints against The Freedom-Site (https://www.freedomsite.org/), the respondents turned the tables. A computer expert named Bernard Klatt did some digging under The Freedom-Site&rsquo;s back office, and determined that the Cools posting had been made from a computer bearing the IP address 66.185.84.204, the very same address from which Warman had admitted to visiting The Freedom-Site using a different alias.</p>
<p>Other technical details &mdash; such as the operating system and Web browser being used &mdash; also provided an exact match to Warman. Based on this evidence, Klatt concluded in a recently publicized affidavit, &#8220;Richard Warman was the poster of the message headed &lsquo;Cools don&rsquo;t belong in our Senate.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Does this mean Warman is a closet bigot? I doubt it. What seems more likely is that &mdash; like other anti-racism activists &mdash; Warman simply found himself running out of Aryan Nation types to chase around the Internet. And so, under this theory, he decided to just start typing the stuff up on his own computer &mdash; and then added these self-authored &#8220;racist&#8221; postings to his blunderbuss brief against The Freedom-Site. (As Klatt notes, Warman has been accused of perpetrating the same sort of stunts on other right-wing Web sites.) When you&rsquo;ve got profitable hate-speech cases to prosecute, why wait for some unemployed conspiracy theorist to start raving against immigrants when you can just manufacture the evidence yourself?</p>
<p>Bizarre as this episode may be, it is of a piece with a larger trend &mdash; symbolized, south of the border, by the shamefully trumped up case against the Duke University lacrosse team. The anti-racism industry, running out of legitimate hatemongers to go after, has gone rogue in its search for attention and relevance.</p>
<p>It also raises the question: How many other faux-racist frauds are out there? Thanks to Warman, it&rsquo;s a question I now think about every time a Canadian hate-speech activist or blogger publicizes an email he gets from some whitepower22@hotmail.com (mailto:whitepower22@hotmail.com) or other. These poisonous messages are held up as dramatic proof that there are still plenty of Nazi types out there &mdash; and that without hate-speech laws to shut them up, the country&rsquo;s gays, Jews, Black and Arabs will remain at risk of verbal assault, or worse. But if the picking are so slim that anti-racists have slid into second careers as fiction writers, what does that say about the scale of the problem? How many of the other examples of &#8220;hate&#8221; that you see out there are similarly bogus?</p>
<p>The anti-racism industry has become an industry like any other: As the actual need for what it&rsquo;s peddling has diminished in this extraordinarily tolerant nation, the industry&rsquo;s various profiteers and carnival barkers have created myths and exaggerated fears to prop themselves up.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve written before, this would not be so much a problem if their various speech codes were used merely to prosecute men such as David Ahenakew, Ernst ZÃ¼ndel, Jim Keegstra and the like. But in the post-9/11 era, radical anti-racists are also agitating to shut up sensible people saying sensible things about the war against militant Islam, the defining global struggle of our era. They&rsquo;re also giving comfort to Islamists who seek to carve out sectarian taboos from our hallowed tradition of free speech.</p>
<p>All of this would be destructive enough on its own. When the censors start churning out the hate speech themselves &mdash; that makes them as much a farce as a menace.<br>

			<p>These activists have used this tactic over and over.  They plant racist posts, messages, etc., and then they play hero as they claim to expose it.  They have no sense of decency and no respect for the truth.  If it works, they use it even if they know it&rsquo;s a hoax.</p>

<p>I have also noticed a &#8220;deleting&#8221; of several diatribes by black agitators on Youtube. Some of this material, such as the rantings of Kaliad Muhammad of NOI are important to keep in the public memory as examples of pure racial anger. Sadly, Youtube has the power to drop these horrors down the memory hole, or in this case &#8220;tube&#8221;. </p>

<p>Oh to the contrary.  He seems to be bigoted against Anglo-Germanic people.  He was trying to instigate hatred against Anglos.</p>
<p><i>this would not be so much a problem if their various speech codes were used merely to prosecute men such as David Ahenakew, Ernst ZÃ¼ndel, Jim Keegstra and the like. </i></p>
<p>Oh yes it would.  The truth matters.  Even if you are at odds with certain people it does not give you the right to manufacture evidence.  If a person willfully lies about your enemy it is only a matter of time before he lies about you to.</p>

			<p>With the recent staged &#8220;noose&#8221; incidents here in the USSA, and the SPLC denouncing innocent Americans as &#8220;nazis&#8221; to the FBI, why would things be any different in Canada?</p>
<p>The object of these agents provacateur is not the end of &#8220;racism&#8221;, but the control by them of society and the individuals who comprise it.</p>

			<p>Whoever David Ahenakew, Ernst Zundel, Jim Keegstra, and their like might be, Jonathan Kay is an enemy of free speech to imagine that merely prosecuting them for their opinions is OK.  I suspect that his real concern is that his own mildly right-of-left wing  views might soon be declared anathema by the multicultural authorities, as they continue to slice away the range of tolerated thought.  </p>

			<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me one bit. Warman, like most &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; is a friggin&rsquo; lunatic. He has even claimed that David Icke, the conspiracy nut who thinks the world is secretly run by lizards, is a Nazi. I think the fact that Warman could publicly admit to believing this and still remain deadly serious tells us a heck of a lot about the inner workings of the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; mind.  </p>
<p><br>
P.S. I&rsquo;m sure it was Warman who was behind the Halifax incident.</p>

			<p>Shades of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton!!! Creeps like this manufacture false, offensive speeches so that legitimate speech and protest are squashed. Anyone who says anything even remotely sounding anti-minority or pro-white is immediately labeled &#8216;racist&rsquo;. These people are the enemies of freedom and should be treated accordingly by legitimate law. We have many years of history of this, and even much worse, type of race baiting and it is the bane of any type of constructive dialogue. Contrary to what the self appointed protectors of minority rights believe, white people have rights as well. If there ever was a forgotten race in the western hemisphere, it is the indigenous white race. No race in modern times has given so much and yet no race has been so vilified. I, for one, am very sick of it.</p>

<p>Hey, &#8216;Native of Alberta&rsquo;  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t recall your &#8216;handle&rsquo;, so welcome to this forum. I&rsquo;m here to learn, above all else, and I very much want to be able to talk intelligently about &#8220;racism&#8221;. </p>
<p>Would you please *define*  that word &#8220;racism&#8221; for me and others here? What exactly do you mean by that term?</p>

			<p>Spot on.  &#8220;Racism&#8221; will always be a &#8220;phenomenon&#8221; to be &#8220;combatted&#8221; in our society, not because there are no arrangements under which the races can live in harmony and mutual respect (simple, genuine freedom of association and contract, impartial enforcement of law, and admission, hiring and promotion according to individual merit would usually suffice to achieve same), but because &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; provides such lucrative and prestigious employment for politicians, bureaucrats, academicians, NGO&rsquo;s, &#8220;diversity consultants,&#8221; the SPLC, etc.  This is what the figment of the &#8220;anti-racists&rsquo;&#8221; imagination they call &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; really means: a &#8220;construct&#8221; which can be perpetually and irrefutably attributed to Western societies in order to secure permanent employment for such diversity-mongers.</p>

			<p>Though it is certainly the least toxic of Toronto&rsquo;s newspapers, the National Post is certainly neoconservative rather than conservative. It&rsquo;s pro-abortion, pro-gay marriage and pro-&#8216;hate&rsquo; laws. That most Torontonians seem to think it extremely right-wing speaks volumes about the level of political awareness in their city.</p>

Although this article might not be as forthright or as forceful as some of us might prefer, we must realize there are limits   &mdash;   and tightly-proscribed limits at that   &mdash;   on just how much sympathy towards &#8220;anti-anti-racist&#8221; type of thinking is ALLOWED in a mainstream publication like the National Post. The fact that the writer Jonathan Kay is able to get away with EVEN THIS MUCH is remarkable   &mdash;   and suggests there may yet be hope in the conservative MSM for some legitimate and long-overdue discussion of the White West&rsquo;s various racial and political grievances. </p>
<p>(Although AR&rsquo;s disclaimer that the article seems to have vanished into cyberspace suggests maybe he DIDN&rsquo;T get away with it! Hmmm&hellip;) </p>
<p>The main thing is: Kay comes out clearly AGAINST the recent abuses by Canada&rsquo;s Human Rights Commissions. These HRCs are the PC maniacs who&rsquo;ve been witch-hunting respectable conservative journalists like Mark Steyn and Ezra Levant   &mdash;   for which there is NO excuse in a supposed democracy like Canada   &mdash;   and are apparently also susceptible to professional scolds like this Richard Warman character. </p>
<p>The fact that Warman   &mdash;   a former member of the HRC himself   &mdash;   is actually going around CREATING IMAGINARY THOUGHTCRIMES in order to have something to complain about, makes this whole sorry situation with these HRCs just that much WORSE! Can someone please explain to me why what Warman did   &mdash;   post some fake hatespeech on a site, and then PERSECUTING that site for failing to delete it   &mdash;   is not ENTRAPMENT? Talk about &#8220;Manufacturing Dissent!&#8221;</p>
<p>What the heck happened to you Canadians? You used to be such a smart, sensible, likable country. </p>
<p>Then again, so did America&hellip;<br>

			<p>A bit of google research shows that Warman is an employee of the Canadian government and is strongly supported by B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith (Rothschilds), the Anti-Defamation League (Rothschilds) and the Canadian Jewish Congress or &#8216;CJC&rsquo; (Bronfman family, connected to the Rothschilds)- for all these read &#8216;Bilderberg Group&rsquo;. He is violently opposed to allowing people to speak on conspiracy issues such as 9/11.  </p>
<p>The agent provocateur comments revealed in the article are interesting and tie in with my belief that mass immigration is about divide and rule and fine tuning social tensions to a degree that will require more authoritarian government and the elimination of our human rights, the perfect political climate for robbing us of our sovereignty and forging this global government. A couple more quotes: </p>
<p>&#8220;The time for absolute and exclusive sovereignty&hellip;has passed; its theory was never matched by reality.&#8221;<br>
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, An Agenda for Peace, 1992.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn&rsquo;t such a great idea after all.&#8221;<br>

			<p>An important element of this story, was the fact it was pulled by the censors at the <i>National Post.</i></p>
<p>Unlike the U.S. citizens, Canadians must suffer under totalitarian edicts requiring censorship by &#8220;human rights tribunals, so-called &#8220;hate laws&#8221; etc&hellip;.. lest the general public get wind of how little freedom we really have.</p>
<p>As for Warman&hellip;his name says it all. He&rsquo;s nothing more than a warring Agent Provocateur whose sole aim is to stir up trouble and create dissension.</p>

			<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me one bit. These &#8216;racism is everywhere&rsquo; extremists pounce on any non-incident they can find and milk it for all it&rsquo;s worth. I remember back in 2001 when Liberal Member of Parliament Hedy Fry stood up in the House of Commons and declared that &#8220;crosses are being burned on the lawns of Prince George as we speak!&#8221; There were no police, RCMP, or media reports even remotely confirming this. Ms. Fry then claimed to have received a letter from the mayor of Prince George informing her of the cross burnings. He publicly denied this, and Ms. Fry couldn&rsquo;t produce any letter (surprise, surprise!). The incident was dropped pretty fast.</p>
<p>Prince George is a small city in B.C., with a blue-collar base, very largely white, and not particularly multicultural. Had Ms. Fry chosen to malign a city with a large ethnic population, would she have gotten off so lightly? Not bloody likely! And I suspect that Mr. Richard Warman will get off with little more than a slap on the wrist. It&rsquo;s all about the double standard - anybody can denigrate whites, but don&rsquo;t dare try doing the same thing to non-whites.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Manufacturing racism so that anti-racists remain relevant.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s safe to say this kind of sleaziness happens in the U.S. also. What with phony nooses being hung. N-words scrawled on walls. </p>
<p>One offshoot of this sleaze tactic being that &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; garbage foistered on gullible young people in schools and colleges. Generally by teachers and professors seeing the p.c. propaganda route a short cut to tenture, to getting their names in print, even to FOSTER ANGER by the general public   &mdash;   thus fueling the &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; poison they disseminate. THINK ABOUT IT!</p>
<p>Those eminent sociologists, researchers and professors NEED to instigate anger and perceived racism in the community. What neater, easier route than by spouting that White Privilege trash at young people. Predictably, the angry phone calls, letters expressing outrage, by members of the community then become &#8220;evidence&#8221; supporting the race hustling professor&rsquo;s claim that Whites will fight tooth and nail to prevent loss of their cherished status. A route certainly a lot safer than that silly trick by that Canadian race-hustling shyster.</p>

			<p>This sounds like mischa obama pronouncing America has had nothing to be proud of for the last thirty years.  Agents of change, more like change of history to suit your narrow narrative. I, as a White American am very proud of what White America has done the last thirty years, like the advances in computers, the Internet and all related products, the Space Shuttle, the advances against communism, the liberation of hundreds of millions of eastern Europeans, etc.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://m3peeps.org/03/cmu.htm" rel="nofollow">Central Michigan University &#8216;Noose&rsquo; Incident</a> is still being &#8220;investigated.&#8221;  I wasn&rsquo;t sure at first, but I&rsquo;m now convinced that the whole thing was just another hoax.  Probably a very well executed hoax, too, because (I suspect) the construction and placement of the nooses were just enough to create a big uproar, but not enough to constitute actual &#8220;ethnic intimidation&#8221; for which someone could be prosecuted.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;I remember back in 2001 when Liberal Member of Parliament Hedy Fry stood up in the House of Commons and declared that &#8216;crosses are being burned on the lawns of Prince George (95% white) as we speak!&rsquo; There were no police, RCMP, or media reports even remotely confirming this.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Yet incredibly, this budding <i>Agent Provocateur</i> still remains in office. I&rsquo;m beginning to believe that we really do deserve the politicians whom we elect.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Hedy Fry is a Black immigrant from Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</p>

It DOESN&rsquo;T mean it isn&rsquo;t true   &mdash;   it only means it hasn&rsquo;t yet been conclusively proven, and until it can be proven the paper must give Warman the benefit of the doubt. <br>

			<p>i think the most important aspect of this story is not that it happened, but that so many of those groups who are allegedly interested in promoting racial harmony are so completely indifferent. perhaps they aren&rsquo;t interested in promoting racial harmony after all? indeed, its about money and politics. a bunch of small men with power. and they don&rsquo;t care if the firestorms they stir up get people hurt or even killed just as long as they continue living in the lap of luxury. they&rsquo;re nothing but political prostitutes.</p>

<p>Well, after reading what was on that link it isn&rsquo;t at all clear that Kay&rsquo;s allegations were shown to be false.  Is that computer evidence real or is it not?  The web site doesn&rsquo;t say.  Maybe they just didn&rsquo;t want to have to pay for an expensive lawsuit.</p>

<p>Retraction</p>
<p>On Monday, the National Post posted on its FullComment.com web blog a column by Jonathan Kay that repeated allegations made by Bernard Klatt in a 2006 sworn affidavit against lawyer and Canadian human rights activist Richard Warman. Mr. Klatt has alleged that a racist posting on Freedomsite about Senator Anne Cools was made by Mr. Warman in 2003. The National Post has no evidence to support Mr. Klatt&rsquo;s allegation against Mr. Warman and it hereby retracts any suggestion that Mr. Warman manufactured any statement about Senator Cools. The National Post apologizes for any embarassment this has caused Mr. Warman. </p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;It should be noted that Hedy Fry is a Black immigrant</p>
<p>Thus his lying rhetoric can be attributed to his racial background. Unfortunately it is a well-known reality Africans and their kin in the Americas, the Carribean, and most assuredly in Europe, constantly reinforce the perception of being the most criminalistic, crime-prone race of sociopaths on this planet! By their actions, by their conduct, by their speech.</p>
<p>An ACCURATE PERCEPTION not based on rabid racism but an opinion based on a well-founded understanding of what Blacks really are like. An awareness well supported by daily news, by history, by daily contact with their race, by personal observation and the related experiences of many other people.</p>
<p>Blacks do not WANT to stand on their own, but want to lay an eternal guilt trip on the other races   &mdash;   an emotional blackmail, so the Whites will support Blacks ad infinitum, and thus forever excuse their sorry actions and behavior. Their dismal failure as a race.</p>

<p>AMERICANS generally were responsible for the inventions, technical progress, scientific and medical knowledge gained over the last century. NOT, as our deluded Afro-Centrists and would be re-writers of African History would prefer us to believe.</p>
<p>Sure the Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, Indians and Pakistanis made improvements and further technical developments on computers and other modern inventions and technologies originating in America. BUT THEY DID NOT INVENT THESE MODERN DEVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES! Which is the point! Orientals are great at coying and even improving on the copies. But that hardly is the same as having thought up and actually invented, TV, computers, radio based telephony products, etc., etc.</p>
