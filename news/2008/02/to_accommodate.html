<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Harvard University has moved to make Muslim women more comfortable in the gym by instituting women-only access times six hours a week to accommodate religious customs that make it difficult for some students to work out in the presence of men.</p>
<p>Men have not been allowed to enter the Quadrangle Recreational Athletic Center during certain times since Jan. 28, after members of the Harvard Islamic Society and the Harvard Women&rsquo;s Center petitioned the university for a more comfortable environment for women.</p>
<p>Harvard Islamic Society&rsquo;s Islamic Knowledge Committee officer Ola Aljawhary, a junior, said the women-only hours are being tested on a trial basis. The special gym hours will be analyzed over Spring Break to determine if they will continue, she said.</p>
<p>Aljawhary said that she does not believe that the women-only gym hours discriminate against men.</p>
<p>&#8220;These hours are necessary because there is a segment of the Harvard female population that is not found in gyms not because they don&rsquo;t want to work out, but because for them working out in a co-ed gym is uncomfortable, awkward or problematic in some way,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harvard junior Nick Wells said he believes the women-only hours are inconvenient for the residents that live near the facility and discriminate against men.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unfair to impose a stringent policy that inhibits [students] from using their own facility in order to further a useless policy that doesn&rsquo;t have any real effect,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t mind that Harvard is trying to give space to women and religious minorities, it&rsquo;s just that it seems that it&rsquo;s not making a real effort,&#8221; Wells said. &#8220;Just one that is impractical and purely symbolic at the cost of people like myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wells lives near the Quad, and said the response to and use of the women-only gym hours so far has been underwhelming.</p>
<p>Harvard freshman Kyle Harasimowicz said women-only gyms have been successful and women-only gym hours fill the same need.</p>

<p>Now is in the United States of all places.</p>
<p>These Muslims must be just rolling over laughing at the gullible Americans.</p>
<p>Actually it is laughable.</p>
<p>I look forward to the day when they close the doors to infadiles.</p>
<p>When will Americans realize there will be no limit to the Muslims demands.</p>
<p>A society so civilized that it accomodates its own demise.<br>

			<p>There is an irrestible force here, but no immovable object. Muzzies, aided by Feminists, against white men. No contest - white men lose.</p>
<p>Over here in SE Asia, our Muzzies have their own couple of islands and pretty much leave the rest of us alone. Yeah, End of Ramadan was a National Holiday, but that is a small price to appease the Muzzies.</p>

			<p>This is effectively a religious accommodation.  But as long as that religion is Islam, it counts as &#8220;diversity&#8221;. </p>
<p>And yet Harvard would be the first to call for the &#8220;separation of church and state&#8221; (meaning the removal of all things Christian from campus).</p>

			<p>I personally don&rsquo;t respect white people from Ivy League schools.  They are girly, country-club, deceiving, and not trustworthy.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if there came a President who refused to put anyone from one of those institutions in his Cabinet?  </p>

<p>They aren&rsquo;t laughing, they are salivating. Predators can smell disease and weakness. And right now, their old nemesis Europe smells pretty ripe. Every display of weakness, every &#8216;appeasement&rsquo;, like Harvard is doing here, gives off quite a stink. Accommodating the demands of islam is just ringing the dinner bell a little louder. Guaranteed that the beast is eying America as its next meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;When will Americans realize there will be no limit to the Muslims demands.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sure would help a lot to have a president that would stop referring to it as the &#8216;religion of peace&rsquo;. Or saying, &#8220;We are not at war with islam.&#8221; Politicians who risk our nation thinking they can appease islam by limiting the fight only to their terrorists, are despicable. Worse, they are criminal.</p>

			<p>The most to be harmed substantially in an environment of sharia law would be secularists at Harvard and other similar problem areas.  </p>
<p>Having to bend to the dictates of a religion whose tenents are in complete opposition to their lifestyles and everything they believe would drive them stark raving crazy, yet they naively carry on non-chalantly with their multicultural agenda as if they had good sense.  It&rsquo;s truly amazing.</p>

			<p>It is  usually assumed  &mdash;  perhaps erroneously  &mdash;  that  places  like Harvard University are  populated in terms of  both  faculty and  students with  individuals  who are  not  only  highly  educated  but  highly  intelligent  &mdash;  in the sense of  the  individual  possessing finely  tuned  and  honed neuronic  structures that are  constantly primed to reprogram  themselves to meet any experienced  contingency  &mdash;  individuals.</p>
<p>Now it would seem  to  me  that  any  rational, intelligent individual  who  has  an  interest in  going  to  the  gym  for physical-health  purposes would  find  it  utterly  stupid and  reflective  of  a  child-like  mentality  that  apartheid-like hours  should  be set aside for some persons  &mdash;  based  on  the pure and  irrelevant contingency of  physical body contour  &mdash;  i.e. gender. </p>
<p>So maybe  the claim  that  at  places like  Harvard University high  intelligence and  mental  acuity are  the  norms is  just plain wrong.</p>

			<p>As a female, I go to my gym when I think fewer men will be there. Not for religious reasons, but simply because I don&rsquo;t like guys hovering over me at weight machines waiting for their turn and when there are fewer guys you have less chance of being ogled by the random pervert. However, that is my choice to go at certain times (and avoid it at other times). I would never demand that they offer a women-only day at my gym. It&rsquo;s absurd. </p>
<p>If the Muslim women want a female-only gym for religious reasons, they should simply join a woman-only gym. Can you imagine if they offered a Men Only day? The women of Harvard would burn down the building in protest. </p>

<p>If it is your premise that gender is no more than a difference in physical body contour and it is irrelevant, when it isn&rsquo;t, and obviously involves so much more a kindergarten child could see the difference, it&rsquo;s plain that this view itself has no basis in intelligent logic.  Nor is it based on factual information.</p>
<p>You criticize people for what you claim are preposterous ideas then furnish two of your own, which make no sense at all.  <br>

			<p>Well of course it&rsquo;s not discrimination, we all know that it&rsquo;s only dastardly white heterosexual males who are capable of &#8220;discrimination&#8221;. I wonder when the muslims-under the guise of &#8220;diversity&#8221; of course-will ask for seperate drinking fountains and restrooms?</p>

			<p>Mr.Kelly,<br>
It&rsquo;s just unfortunate that  some people know  how  to type on a  computer, because it allows them to give vent to nonsensical thinking purely for  the  sake  of  such.</p>
<p>I will say it again: for any intelligent, sane and  rational being  &mdash;  the assumption is  that  Harvard University with its stringent faculty and  student admissions criteria would have admitted such  &mdash;  going  to  gym would be  embarked on only for  the  rational reason of  physical fitness and  health improvement. Thus variations in body contour among the visitors to the  Harvard gym should be of little moment to the  supposedly  rational, intellectually mature and  morally  discriminating who frequent that venue.</p>
<p>In fact, I have  noticed  that  highly intelligent and  creative people  when in public doing  public chores hardly  notice other  people  around  them. Such individuals are, for the  most  part, deeply engrossed in their  own private  thoughts being  casually  dismissive  of  what&rsquo;s  taking place around them.</p>
<p>Given its  self-profile, one  would  imagine that Harvard gym goers  would  be  of  that nature. But this puzzling gym ruling  &mdash;  again for an  environment of  supposedly highly intelligent persons  &mdash;  must lead  one  to  question Harvard&rsquo;s self-profile.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mr.Kelly,<br>
&#8220;It&rsquo;s just unfortunate that some people know how to type on a computer, because it allows them to give vent to nonsensical thinking purely for the sake of such.&#8221;  Occam</p>
<p>Yes, like the above statement for one, which is typical of the nonsense that comes from every black that posts on this forum.  </p>
<p>And, your orginal post is burdened with nonsensical, wordy contortions that are unclear, ambiguous, using words that are inappropriate, and do not fit what you are trying to describe.</p>
<p>You might have meant to say something different when you made reference to body contour, etc., probably referring to body tone and muscular development, but the construction is so clumsy it appears you are talking about &#8220;contour&#8221; of the sexes.</p>
<p>Surely you can do better that.  Or do you not want to try? What was most apparent to me when I first read your post was that you were trying to sound intelligent, and as a result the entire post was close to gibberish.</p>
<p>Occam: &#8220;In fact, I have noticed that highly intelligent and creative people when in public doing public chores hardly notice other people around them. Such individuals are, for the most part, deeply engrossed in their own private thoughts being casually dismissive of what&rsquo;s taking place around them.&#8221;</p>
<p>RK:  Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s just plain nonsense to claim that you think because Harvard is supposed to be comprised of highly intelligent people they&rsquo;re not going to notice people of the opposite sex working out in the same room with them, especially the men?  How utterly preposterous and naive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr.Kelly,<br>
&#8220;It&rsquo;s just unfortunate that some people know how to type on a computer, because it allows them to give vent to nonsensical thinking purely for the sake of such.&#8221;  Occam</p>
<p>RK: How ridiculous is it to claim that someone wants to write nonsense because he likes it, or does so because that is his purpose or intent?  Whether you understand it or not, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying.  Can&rsquo;t you see how silly and unintelligent that sounds?  </p>
<p>Even the above attempt at insult comes across as absurd.<br>
   <br>
When desiring to get across a point of view or a concept, it is an absolute must to write for your readers and not yourself.</p>
<p>Trying to come across as intellectually aloof and erudite, rather than concentrating on conciseness and clarity, oftentimes makes the writer appear to be a pretender of something he really isn&rsquo;t. And, if his premises are invalid, in all likelihood the reader might well believe he is without the intellectual ability to think in logical, coherent terms.</p>

			<p>Golly gee whiz, when are they going to have six hours of male-only gym access, you know, in the interests of fairness and choice?</p>
<p>Is it just me, or does the push towards &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;respect for all people&#8221; never benefit white males?</p>

			<p>&#8220;I will say it again: for any intelligent, sane and rational being (snip) going to gym would be embarked on only for the rational reason of physical fitness and health improvement.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Thus variations in body contour among the visitors to the Harvard gym should be of little moment to the supposedly rational, intellectually mature and morally discriminating who frequent that venue.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Because they go to the gym for the &#8220;rational reason of physical fitness and health improvement,&#8221; and they are &#8220;rational, intellectually mature and morally discriminating,&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t even come close to offering any logical evidence that seeing people of the opposite sex there would not be a distraction. Obviously most everybody visits the gym to work out for whatever reason, except those frat boys who go to ogle the girls.  <br>
 <br>
And to assert that those who claim to be learned and intelligent are expected to be unmoved by those around them is quite amusing.  And by describing these same people as &#8220;morally discriminating,&#8221; aren&rsquo;t you admitting that they&rsquo;re indeed observant of those around them and not lost in deep intellectual thought as you claim you would expect of them?  <br>
 <br>
Let me help you out, my friend. You have taken a very long route around the crux of the issue. Here&rsquo;s what you want to say:<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Since Harvard has such high intellectual standards, and such allegedly intelligent students and faculty, any intelligent, normal person would conclude that those comprising Harvard&rsquo;s gym enthusiasts wouldn&rsquo;t notice anyone of the opposite sex working out among them, nor would they care, because it would rightly be assumed that they would be too engrossed mentally with other matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s what you wanted to say.  However, after having put it in a clearer mode, the logic behind it still amounts to none at all.  It&rsquo;s foolish.</p>
