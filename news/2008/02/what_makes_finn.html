			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ellen Gamerman, Wall Street Journal, February 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>High-school students here rarely get more than a half-hour of homework a night. They have no school uniforms, no honor societies, no valedictorians, no tardy bells and no classes for the gifted. There is little standardized testing, few parents agonize over college and kids don&rsquo;t start school until age 7.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Finland&rsquo;s students are the brightest in the world, according to an international test. Teachers say extra playtime is one reason for the students&rsquo; success. WSJ&rsquo;s Ellen Gamerman reports.</p>
<p>The Finns won attention with their performances in triennial tests sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group funded by 30 countries that monitors social and economic trends. In the most recent test, which focused on science, Finland&rsquo;s students placed first in science and near the top in math and reading, according to results released late last year. An unofficial tally of Finland&rsquo;s combined scores puts it in first place overall, says Andreas Schleicher, who directs the OECD&rsquo;s test, known as the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA. The U.S. placed in the middle of the pack in math and science; its reading scores were tossed because of a glitch. About 400,000 students around the world answered multiple-choice questions and essays on the test that measured critical thinking and the application of knowledge. A typical subject: Discuss the artistic value of graffiti.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One explanation for the Finns&rsquo; success is their love of reading. Parents of newborns receive a government-paid gift pack that includes a picture book. Some libraries are attached to shopping malls, and a book bus travels to more remote neighborhoods like a Good Humor truck.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Finnish high-school senior Elina Lamponen saw the differences firsthand. She spent a year at Colon High School in Colon, Mich., where strict rules didn&rsquo;t translate into tougher lessons or dedicated students, Ms. Lamponen says. She would ask students whether they did their homework. They would reply: &#8220;&rsquo;Nah. So what&rsquo;d you do last night?&rsquo;&#8221; she recalls. History tests were often multiple choice. The rare essay question, she says, allowed very little space in which to write. In-class projects were largely &#8220;glue this to the poster for an hour,&#8221; she says. Her Finnish high school forced Ms. Lamponen, a spiky-haired 19-year-old, to repeat the year when she returned.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the apparent simplicity of Finnish education, it would be tough to replicate in the U.S. With a largely homogeneous population, teachers have few students who don&rsquo;t speak Finnish. In the U.S., about 8% of students are learning English, according to the Education Department. There are fewer disparities in education and income levels among Finns. Finland separates students for the last three years of high school based on grades; 53% go to high school and the rest enter vocational school. (All 15-year-old students took the PISA test.) Finland has a high-school dropout rate of about 4% &mdash; or 10% at vocational schools &mdash; compared with roughly 25% in the U.S., according to their respective education departments.</p>
<p>Another difference is financial. Each school year, the U.S. spends an average of $8,700 per student, while the Finns spend $7,500. Finland&rsquo;s high-tax government provides roughly equal per-pupil funding, unlike the disparities between Beverly Hills public schools, for example, and schools in poorer districts. The gap between Finland&rsquo;s best- and worst-performing schools was the smallest of any country in the PISA testing. The U.S. ranks about average.</p>
<p>Finnish students have little <i>angstata</i> &mdash; or teen angst &mdash; about getting into the best university, and no worries about paying for it. College is free. There is competition for college based on academic specialties &mdash; medical school, for instance. But even the best universities don&rsquo;t have the elite status of a Harvard.</p>
<p>Taking away the competition of getting into the &#8220;right schools&#8221; allows Finnish children to enjoy a less-pressured childhood. While many U.S. parents worry about enrolling their toddlers in academically oriented preschools, the Finns don&rsquo;t begin school until age 7, a year later than most U.S. first-graders.</p>
<p>Once school starts, the Finns are more self-reliant. While some U.S. parents fuss over accompanying their children to and from school, and arrange every play date and outing, young Finns do much more on their own. At the Ymmersta School in a nearby Helsinki suburb, some first-grade students trudge to school through a stand of evergreens in near darkness. At lunch, they pick out their own meals, which all schools give free, and carry the trays to lunch tables. There is no Internet filter in the school library. They can walk in their socks during class, but at home even the very young are expected to lace up their own skates or put on their own skis.</p>
<p>The Finns enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world, but they, too, worry about falling behind in the shifting global economy. They rely on electronics and telecommunications companies, such as Finnish cellphone giant Nokia, along with forest-products and mining industries for jobs. Some educators say Finland needs to fast-track its brightest students the way the U.S. does, with gifted programs aimed at producing more go-getters. Parents also are getting pushier about special attention for their children, says Tapio Erma, principal of the suburban Olari School. &#8220;We are more and more aware of American-style parents,&#8221; he says.</p>
