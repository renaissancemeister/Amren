<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Muslim medical students are refusing to obey hygiene rules brought in to stop the spread of deadly superbugs, because they say it is against their religion.</p>
<p>Women training in several hospitals in England have raised objections to removing their arm coverings in theatre and to rolling up their sleeves when washing their hands, because it is regarded as immodest in Islam.</p>
<p>Universities and NHS trusts fear many more will refuse to co-operate with new Department of Health guidance, introduced this month, which stipulates that all doctors must be &#8220;bare below the elbow&#8221;.</p>
<p>The measure is deemed necessary to stop the spread of infections such as MRSA and Clostridium difficile, which have killed hundreds.</p>
<p>Minutes of a clinical academics&rsquo; meeting at Liverpool University revealed that female Muslim students at Alder Hey children&rsquo;s hospital had objected to rolling up their sleeves to wear gowns.</p>
<p>Similar concerns have been raised at Leicester University. Minutes from a medical school committee said that &#8220;a number of Muslim females had difficulty in complying with the procedures to roll up sleeves to the elbow for appropriate handwashing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sheffield University also reported a case of a Muslim medic who refused to &#8220;scrub&#8221; as this left her forearms exposed.</p>
<p>Documents from Birmingham University reveal that some students would prefer to quit the course rather than expose their arms, and warn that it could leave trusts open to legal action.</p>
<p>Hygiene experts said last night that no exceptions should be made on religious grounds.</p>
<p>Dr Mark Enright, professor of microbiology at Imperial College London, said: &#8220;To wash your hands properly, and reduce the risks of MRSA and C.difficile, you have to be able to wash the whole area around the wrist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think it would be right to make an exemption for people on any grounds. The policy of bare below the elbows has to be applied universally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Charles Tannock, a Conservative MEP and former hospital consultant, said: &#8220;These students are being trained using taxpayers&rsquo; money and they have a duty of care to their patients not to put their health at risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps these women should not be choosing medicine as a career if they feel unable to abide by the guidelines that everyone else has to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Islamic Medical Association insisted that covering all the body in public, except the face and hands, was a basic tenet of Islam.</p>
<p>&#8220;No practising Muslim woman &mdash; doctor, medical student, nurse or patient &mdash; should be forced to bare her arms below the elbow,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Dr Majid Katme, the association spokesman, said: &#8220;Exposed arms can pick up germs and there is a lot of evidence to suggest skin is safer to the patient if covered. One idea might be to produce long, sterile, disposable gloves which go up to the elbows.&#8221;</p>

			<p>More to it than that&hellip;</p>
<p>Over the years I have been assigned to several foreign born Asian doctors (browns, Pakistanis, Indians, Iranians, Arabs), both male and female.</p>
<p>I asked them to leave and told their White Superiors to give me a White doctor from now on or I would take my money someplace else.</p>
<p>They asked me why and I told them the truth, their smell, they needed a bath.</p>
<p>Conversely, I once had a Chinese, but American born doctor, a young kid who reminded me of Charlie Chan&rsquo;s all American &ldquo;number 1 son&rdquo;. He was just fine.</p>

			<p>I used to be employed in the healthcare field.  Disposable gloves are worthless on their own.  They need to be used as an adjunct to thorough handwashing.  <br>
When&rsquo;s the last time you saw a nurse with sleeves down to the wrist?  There is a reason why you don&rsquo;t.<br>
They need to stand FIRM on this!</p>

&#8220;Thanks to self-destructive &#8220;alternative lifestyles,&#8221; out-of-control immigration, the overuse of antibiotics and other causes, long-&#8220;vanquished&#8221; illnesses are once again ravaging the U.S., puzzling scientists and terrifying millions of victims and their loved ones.&#8221; <br>

<p>So, basically, each and every muslim &#8220;health professional&#8221; is a potential typhoid mohammad, so to speak.<br>
It&rsquo;s bad enough to see caucasian Drs. who don&rsquo;t even wash their hands between patients, and I&rsquo;ve seen a few.<br>
Terrrrrrrific&hellip;&hellip;</p>

			<p>These Muslim women should be happy that they are in a country that allows women to study medicine. I doubt that a school in Saudi Arabia or Pakistan would allow a female medical student.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why Moslems consider showing forearms immodest.  It&rsquo;s true seeing the forearms of the opposite sex can be nice, just like someone&rsquo;s neck is nice to see, but it isn&rsquo;t erotic.  What is the problem?</p>

			<p>Guess what? Since your ancient religious rites were created, we&rsquo;ve come up with a BETTER INVENTION called &#8220;hygiene&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wash your damn hands or find a new job. Simple as that. All modesty aside, there is NO ONE who will be turned-on by your hairy brown forearms, so relax. </p>
<p>Are we discriminating against the blind because we won&rsquo;t let them drive buses? </p>

			<p>This is absolutely ridicuolus.  I am a medical student and you can&rsquo;t just allow certain religious &#8220;people&#8221; to practice a certain way.  We follow ruled and ethics that are set up to protect not only ourselves but of course our patients.  They should be sent back to there country.  I agree with the man who wrote that immigration is bringing diseases that were once gone out of America.  They should be suspended from school if they do not abide by the rules.<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
ANY  part of the body not normally seen, can be eroticized. Like the Chinese did with feet. When always hidden, it becomes the subject of fantasy, even if that&rsquo;s inconprehensible to us.  What humans can&rsquo;t have, we want to have. And what we can&rsquo;t see, we want to see.  This is why Victorian men once hoped for a glimpse of a bit of ankle, which was considered quite &#8220;naughty&#8221; at the time. Nowadays, an ankle wouldn&rsquo;t draw a yawn, when they can see so much more.</p>
<p>This is why Egyptian women in the 1800s, come upon unexpectedly  by a strange male, with their faces uncovered, would use their skirts to hide their faces, thus making clear what they condidered most important to cover.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible for us in the West to understand, or underestimate, the enormous effect all this casual exposure of skin has upon persons coming from an utterly different culture.</p>
<p>As a tiny example of this, I remember once sitting next to an Arab-type young man in an airplane. A young woman across the aisle just ahead of us bent over to get something from her bag on the floor, exposing perhaps an inch of skin at her waistline. He was absolutely bug-eyed!   And I noticed that he couldn&rsquo;t take his eyes off her for the remainder of the flight. I should add too that she wasn&rsquo;t even attractive!  But an inch of skin was enough to have him enthralled.</p>
<p>Exposed waistlines have become very common among young girls nowadays. It seems  be the fashion.  One can only imagine the effect this has on a young man just arriving here from the Middle East, who never saw a woman out of a burkha!</p>
<p>This was all explained in Prof. William Graham Sumner&rsquo;s marvelous classic, &#8220;Folkways&#8221;, written long ago, but still the last word on the subject of human mores and customs.  Very highly recommended!</p>
