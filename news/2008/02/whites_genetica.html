						<p>White Americans are both genetically weaker and less diverse than their black compatriots, a Cornell University-led study finds.</p>
<p>Analyzing the genetic makeup of 20 Americans of European ancestry and 15 African-Americans, researchers found that the former showed much less variation among 10,000 tested genes than did the latter, which was expected.</p>
<p>They also found that Europeans had many more possibly harmful mutations than did African, which was a surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we tend to think of European populations as quite large, we did not expect to see a significant difference in the distribution of neutral and deleterious variation between the two populations,&#8221; said senior co-author Carlos Bustamante, an assistant professor of biological statistics and computational biology at Cornell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been known for years that all non-Africans are descended from a small group, perhaps only a few dozen individuals, who left the continent between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago.</p>
<p>But the Cornell study, published in the journal Nature Thursday, indicates that Europeans went through a second &#8220;population bottleneck,&#8221; probably about 30,000 years ago, when the ancestral population was again reduced to relatively few in number.</p>
<p>Click <a href=" https://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Feb08/BustamanteAA.kr.html" target="cornell" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here</b></a> for the Cornell press release, and <a href=" https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7181/full/nature06611.html" target="nature" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here</b></a> for the full article in Nature.</p>
<p>The doubly diluted genetic diversity has allowed &#8220;bad&#8221; mutations to build up in the European population, something that the more genetically varied African population has had more success in weeding out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For example, Native Americans show even less genetic diversity than Europeans, having descended from a few thousand people who entered North America about 10,000 years ago.</p>
<p>That fact was reinforced by a larger-scale study, also published in Nature, led by scientists from the Universities of Michigan and Virginia who analyzed genetic samples of 485 individuals scattered around the globe whose DNA is recorded in a French databank.</p>
<p>As would be expected with the &#8220;out of Africa&#8221; theory, the researchers found Africans had the greatest amount of genetic diversity, followed in turn by Middle Easterners, then Europeans and South Asians at about equal levels, then East Asians.</p>

<p>A third study, published in the journal Science on Friday, may be the most fascinating of all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Native Americans have at least one closely related group in Asia &mdash; the Yakuts of eastern Siberia, who themselves are related to other hunter-gatherer Siberian tribes, some of whom build wooden teepees.</p>
<p>The Basques in northeastern Spain and southwestern France may be right to demand their own nation &mdash; they&rsquo;re not closely related to anyone else. Surprisingly, neither are the residents of Sardinia off the coast of Italy.</p>

			<p>I know what they are saying but I wish they didn&rsquo;t write genetically &#8220;weaker.&#8221; Many would take this as a way of saying that blacks are physically &#8220;stronger&#8221; than whites, which is just not the case. Take a look at a boxing match or a UFC/MMA fight to see who is &#8220;weaker&#8221; in that regard.</p>
<p>As to potentially harmful mutations, I&rsquo;m sure whites and others are more likely to get, say, Downs syndrome, than blacks. </p>

			<p>Why do &#8216;genetically weaker&rsquo; populations flourish and &#8216;genetically diverse&rsquo; populations stagnate? I would guess that Europeans are descended from a small group of extremely intelligent people and Africans are descended from a vast pool of imbeciles. </p>

<p><br>
a)Europeans are sexually selected</p>
<p>b)Africans are environmentally selected</p>
<p>c)Africans are very natural..Europeans are naturally more aristcratic type and prefer law and order</p>
<p> even a 5 yr old third worlder knows all this. My kid studies at the Univ of Texas and he sees it every day..blacks are just much more macho even when compared to Latinos. <br>

			<p>If being &#8220;weaker&#8221; and having less intra-racial genetic diversity is such a disadvantage, then why do the stronger and more diverse people reference in this article want to live among the former category?</p>
<p>I can hardly believe that a people who can have wildly varying colors of hair are said to be less diverse than people who can have hair in any color they want as long as it&rsquo;s black.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a form of purity?</p>
<p>the researchers found Africans had the greatest amount of genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that proof of being a mongrel??</p>
<p>If having the greatest amount of genetic diversity is a good thing. How come they never had the wheel or devised a written script???</p>

			<p>That Basques and Sardinians are not closely related to their neighbors is well known. Back in the 60&rsquo;s, blood type testing showed Basques to be genetically far removed other Spaniards. And Sardinians have long been known as descendents of Phoenician settlers in antiquity, a time when other residents of what is now Italy were engaged in the Punic wars against the Phoenician settlers of Carthage. </p>

			<p> How can anyone believe what science says anymore. It has <br>
gotten so perverted today with Leftist doublespeak and<br>
bias. I mean first they say there Is no genetic basis<br>
for race and It&rsquo;s a social construct, because genetically<br>
we&rsquo;re all the same. And now they come out with this study<br>
that basically says Whites are genetically weak ??!! How<br>
If there Is no genetic basis for race as they previously<br>
have declared, And now when they say that there are It&rsquo;s<br>
claiming Whites are a genetically weak race. If that Is the<br>
case, why are more Blacks sick and afflicted with more<br>
genetic diseases according to other studies ? This Is<br>
more Leftist race mixing junk science, notice how the<br>
say Blacks are genetically stronger due to genetic<br>
DIVERSITY - I.E. race mixing.</p>

<p>The new age sector has mediums who &#8220;channel&#8221; tell them the Basques are the survivors of the lost continent of Atlantis.</p>
<p>Before you laugh, one of the most famous was Edgar Cayce, a man who accurately diagnosed literally thousands of medical cases of people all over the world while in a hypnotic trance.  No one today thinks of Cayce as a kook.  His effectiveness was proven many times over, and he died a pauper while trying to help people to his last breath.</p>
<p>So does that make him right about Atlantis?  I don&rsquo;t know, but I would trust him over the fumbling politically correct entities who call themselves scientists nowadays, but change their theories to reflect political correctness, like Dr. Watson.</p>

			<p>As inferior White people, I feel that it is our duty to warn all Blacks that they should avoid all propinquity with us so as to avoid any pollution of their superior gene pool.  This would of course include copulation with White women. Such liasons would certainly weaken the Black genes in any progeny that might be produced as a result of the above couplings. </p>
<p>I wonder when they are going to indoctinate our children. Maybe that wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary if the official Final Solution to the White question could be initiated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I also find the statement, &#8220;Whites Genetically Weaker&#8221; offensive. </p>

			<p>&#8220;White Americans are both genetically weaker and less diverse than their black compatriots, a Cornell University-led study finds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Could you imagine a Cornell University study loudly proclaiming something inflammatory like &#8220;Black Americans are genetically both less intelligent and more prone to violence than their non-black compatriots.&#8221; ?<br>
But it&rsquo;s OK to claim anything you want about whites, however inflammatory.<br>
Of course the term &#8220;genetically weaker&#8221; is a term of insult, to imply genetic inferiority, not a scientific term. It is meaningless. It refers to the fact that non-blacks have a much tighter genetic distribution. That does not make them &#8220;weaker&#8221;, whatever that means. <br>
Of course, you read further in the article and find that other races are just as &#8220;weak&#8221; genetically or even more so (per the peculiar definition of &#8220;weak&#8221; used by this gleeful hate-whitey reporter). But it would not have been PC to say &#8220;study shows American Indians are more genetically weak than anyone else&hellip;&#8221;. Or &#8220;study shows Asians are more genetically weak&hellip;&#8221;. No, as typical, whites are singled out for propaganda purposes. You must read on to find out that statement was not true. If accuracy in reporting were the purpose, the statement would have been &#8220;study shows that there is a tighter genetic distribution among non-blacks than among blacks.&#8221; But then you&rsquo;d loose an opportunity to try to falsely imply racial inferiority of whites to those who only read the first paragraph or title of an article.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s been known for years that all non-Africans are descended from a small group, perhaps only a few dozen individuals, who left the continent between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>This shows that the idiotic racist term &#8220;people of color&#8221; which singles out white Europeans for exclusion is absurd: It is all NON-BLACKS who have much more in common and are much more closely related to each other than they are with blacks. So a more sensible term would be something like &#8220;people of light&#8221; to refer to everyone who is not of sub-Sahara African origin. All people of light are close cousins. The chasm is between people of light and blacks. Offended by this? Then keep this in mind the next time you hear the offensive nonsense term &#8220;people of color&#8221;!<br>
As an act of protest I urge all to freely and often use the term &#8220;people of light&#8221; until the term &#8220;people of color&#8221; is recognized as the racist exclusionary term it is.</p>

			<p>This article is obviously an attempt to encourage miscegenation, saying that whites, being inbred due to their geographic cocoon have failed to evolve the strengths of healthily varied races, even though, as we all know, there is no such thing as race. This type of propaganda fails to investigate the obvious limitations of any other group on the planet, all of which look to Europeans for salvation, money, medicine, innovation and education. </p>
<p>The Kenyan, Congolese and Rwandan tribes, the crazed religious sects of North Africa of the Middle East, and the multiplicity of tribal and political factions among the Hispanics of South America do not show that this supposed diversity in itself is of great benefit. On the other hand, given the extremely limited capacities of the Asian who flock to accounting and business colleges, together with their obsession with trends and conformity, reflect an oppressive homogeneity much at odds with the aspirational individuality of even the most drone-like white. </p>
<p>The author is obviously part of some insidious movement to make whites think they would prosper by interbreeding biracially. This type of urging is far more extreme than any miscegenation laws that had been used in the past for our protection, protection our misguided rulers have abandoned.</p>

			<p>By this same thinking, the Chimp is more genetically diverse than the African.  The diversity in African DNA is not all good.  Some leads to greater negative mutations such as hair lips and other birth defects.  Can anyone imagine a headline in a major newspaper that declared without question or comment that Whites were smarter than blacks or that black were more prone to disorder and violence.  </p>

			<p>Bizarre article.  I have heard this claim many times before that Africans are the &#8220;most genetically diverse,&#8221; but that does not seem to mean anything more than that they are the oldest race, with fewer genetic bottlenecks in their history.  Even if the bottleneck did result in a slightly higher chance for certain harmful mutations (hard to believe, since this occurred 30,000 years ago, plus its obvious there were plenty of beneficial adaptations to a cool, cloudy, northern climate), I think most people would accept the trade-off between a 1% increased incidence of some rare disease and a gain of 15 IQ points, on average.</p>

The research paper itself from Cornell did not come to these conclusions that white people are somehow &#8220;weaker&#8221; or &#8220;inferior&#8221;&hellip;It was a rather unexciting paper&hellip;The point is that it was interpreted that way by FOX news website&hellip;You know&hellip;The &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; people&hellip;.and I am sure it is only a coincidence that this is Black History Month&hellip;</p>

<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big Sci Fi fan, and during the 90&rsquo;s, I noticed many of the shows trying to mention how great &#8216;genetic diversity&rsquo; is. </p>
<p>I fully expect the nations schools to begin the day with &#8220;I pledge alliegiance, unto the flag of the United States of American, and unto the diversity, for which it stands&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wise to match up the appearance of things, with what goes on inside. At least, that&rsquo;s what I expect at schools that don&rsquo;t begin the day listening to the black national anthem, like many of them have been doing for the last 60 years. </p>

			<p>Keep in mind mutation is key for evolution, no mutations also means no evolution. </p>
<p>I am a little unsure about these &#8220;genetically weaker&#8221; claims, most of the worlds best weightlifters are Northern European. It seems to me, blacks actually ARE naturally more athletically built than whites at a young age, but they virtually all become morbidly obese come middle age. </p>
<p>Where I live, in New York, it seems almost all whites, are in pretty good shape, whereas if you walk around any Black area and you see fastfood restaurants on every corner all overflowing with massive bulbous bodies.  </p>
<p>I remember reading this NY Times study a year or two ago claiming that 25 percent of the adult population of East Harlem had diabetes and the average life expectancy for black males was around 50 so being &#8220;genetically stronger&#8221; is probably not all it is cracked up to be.</p>

			<p>Many whites have such a lack of genetic diversity, to hear these people tell it, it&rsquo;s a wonder they don&rsquo;t simply fall over and die.</p>
<p>On the plus side, since humans have more genetic diversity, than say, worms, and worms more than bacteria; since blacks have more genetic diversity than whites, this could be the ultimate proof blacks are more advanced than whites. I don&rsquo;t expect the diversitiods to jump on this information. After all, even the blackest nations in africa, for whatever reasons, constantly sell versions of this &#8216;white supremacy&rsquo; idea, even if only to claim themselves victims of it.  </p>

			<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t elaborate on what is meant by &#8220;genetic strength&#8221;.  Does it mean high intelligence, physical health and strength and vitality?  Africans and blacks in general seem to possess very little of these qualities.  Whatever the objective of this so called study the results are far from conclusive.    </p>

			<p>But the Cornell study, published in the journal Nature Thursday, indicates that Europeans went through a second &ldquo;population bottleneck,&rdquo; probably about 30,000 years ago, when the ancestral population was again reduced to relatively few in number.</p>
<p>You mean, like the Noah flood families&rsquo; dispersal? As the &#8216;elect of God&rsquo; that founded monotheism, and became the Chosen People- the nations of Europe, unlike say, certain Turkic tribes mentioned by authors such as Arthur Koestler?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a big advocate of eugenics.  There&rsquo;s way too much contamination in the White gene pool.  What started with some settlers breeding with the Indians has now exploded into large scale miscegenation.  People just aren&rsquo;t taking care of themselves anymore by practicing good breeding.  I saw a big fat White woman in the store last week with her mulatto baby in tow.  This woman was functionally black.  She spoke blackanese and she had her hair in those &#8220;raked spaces&#8221;.  Then there&rsquo;s the White guy who looks like he suffers from klinefelders syndrome (small hands, peach fuzz, lanky) accompanied by his mail order bride from the orient.  I don&rsquo;t believe in miscegenation but I suppose it&rsquo;s better that people like this are removed from our gene pool.  </p>

<p><i> This should not be a surprise. Look at the diseases that White settlers bought to the new world and gave to the native Americans. </i> <i>Whites have carried disease wherever they go. </i></p>
<p>1) The most devastating of illnesses brought to the new world was smallpox which is believed to have come from Africa:</p>
<p><a href="https://dermatology.about.com/cs/smallpox/a/smallpoxhx.htm" rel="nofollow">https://dermatology.about.com/cs/smallpox/a/smallpoxhx.htm</a></p>
<p>The origin of smallpox is uncertain, but it is believed to have originated in Africa and then spread to India and China thousands of years ago. The first recorded smallpox epidemic was in 1350 BC during the Egyptian-Hittite war. Smallpox reached Europe between the 5th and 7th centuries and was present in major European cities by the 18th century.</p>
<p>The first African slave brought to Mexico is said to be one Juan Cortés, a slave who accompanied the conquistador Hernán Cortés in 1519. The Indians, reportedly astonished by his dark skin, having never seen an African before, took him for a god! Another of the early conquistadores, Pánfilo Narvaez, brought a slave who has been credited with bringing the devastating smallpox epidemic of 1520. Mexican anthropologist Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán estimates that there were 6 blacks who took part in the conquest of Mexico.</p>
<p>https://www.afromexico.com/brief.htm</p>
<p>These early slaves were more personal servants of their masters, who may be thought of as squires. These slaves were most likely taken from Africa, then transported to Seville, where early slaves were Christianized, and they probably spoke Spanish by the time they reached the New World. These slaves didn&rsquo;t come over on slave ships as part of an overt slave trade. </p>
<p></p>
<p>2) If you had understood the article, it indicates that Blacks would most likely be better equipped genetically to withstand diseases than Whites and hence be better carriers to transmit devastating illness. That said you generally can&rsquo;t blame the transmission of catastrophic illness on any race, since in general it was random. (With a few notable exceptions&hellip;) </p>

			<p>Hmmm.. an interesting and if phrased differently.. inflammatory headline.. let&rsquo;s look at the body of the text:</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;As would be expected with the &ldquo;out of Africa&rdquo; theory, the researchers found Africans had the greatest amount of genetic diversity, followed in turn by Middle Easterners, then Europeans and South Asians at about equal levels, then East Asians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, Native Americans show even less genetic diversity than Europeans, having descended from a few thousand people who entered North America about 10,000 years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Oddly enough (gee I wonder why..?) there was no commentary as to whether East and South Asians and American Indians are genetically weaker than Whites (since apparently all of the aforementioned groups have less genetic diversity than Europeans&hellip;) </p>
<p>And lets see how this genetic diversity versus genetic homogeneity plays out in the real world.</p>
<p>Life expectancy in various countries:</p>

			<p>Whites probably are genetically weaker, meaning we&rsquo;ve suffered from recent dysgenic evolution and currently have more unwanted mutations. All we need to do is reorient society to selecting survival of the fittest, while opposing any sort of genetic tampering - I&rsquo;d far rather be a proud white rather than a weak GMO&hellip; We need to preserve the genetic heritage our Creator gave us.</p>
<p>Mixing can create weaker hybrids from parts that do not work well together. All we need to do is remove the unwanted mutations and preserve our genetic heritage.</p>

			<p>WOW, you guys really don&rsquo;t know what &#8220;Genetic Diversity&#8221; is.  It has nothing to do with Stronger or Smarter.  All that means is when you break people down genetically you will have more to deal with when looking at an African.  Because everybody came FROM Africa, those that were IN Africa for thousands of years before anyone left had the time to generate the most genetic mutations.  And these are not &#8220;mutts&#8221; the variation is African variation.  Also IN Africa, the country that has the most genetic diversity is the African horn - Ethiopia where many people left in the out of Africa scenario.  In those populations with the mutations that left a few stayed inside Ethiopia, which shows the variation that we see today.  What this means is there are now populations that are resistant to HIV in Africa, this will probably never happen anywhere else on the globe.  Also if there were a killer Virus that every human caught that wiped out 95% of the earths population&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Those left would probably be Africans because with all that genetic variations in the Genes of Africans the virus would hit a genetic roadblock.  For the record about 93.5 % OF ALL GENETIC VARIATION IS FOUND IN AFRICA.</p>
