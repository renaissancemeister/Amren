<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Europe is a dying continent. I say this not as a criticism, but rather as a statement of fact. In Europe, an acute failure to produce the next generation has created a looming demographic crisis.</p>
<p>According to research by both the CIA and the U.N., every single member of the European Union has a birthrate significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1 births per woman. In the CIA World Factbook, Germany had a birthrate of 1.36 children per woman in 2007, and Spain and Italy had birthrates of 1.29. At such low levels of fertility, within 100 years, those three nations would have populations 80 percent lower than they are today. {snip}</p>
<p>Even if one ignores the statistical noise presented by the inclusion of millions of outliers, Europe faces a serious problem. Without a major shift in the current fertility trends, industrialized Europe will see its native population decline by about three-fourths over the 21st century. No civilization has ever recovered from such a population decline, and never before has such a decline been entirely voluntary.</p>
<p>Europeans are not becoming less fertile as a consequence of war, or famine, or disease, but rather as a consequence of their Western, consumerist lifestyles. Some, such as social critic Mark Steyn, have suggested that European civilization is in the middle of committing voluntary demographic suicide, and it&rsquo;s not hard to see why: A civilization that is producing a tiny succeeding generation and shows no signs of attempting to remedy the problem is violating fundamental Darwinist principles of gene propagation.</p>
<p>{snip} Some economists have argued that because the infertility of Europeans is balanced by the high fertility of its immigrants, there will be no noticeable effects from the failure of Caucasians in Europe to produce offspring. If the population as a whole remains stable, the argument goes, economic growth will not be affected, and the European quality of life will likely remain constant. Europe could thus theoretically solve its demographic woes by promoting immigration.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some major holes in that argument. Labor capital is not stable: Native Europeans tend to be highly educated and possess a varied skill set due to Europe&rsquo;s laudable educational system, while the immigrant populations replacing the native populations are by and large less well educated. Crime levels are also not holding constant, and in Europe there has been an anti-immigrant backlash resulting from the widespread perception that immigrants are responsible for the increase in crime. There is also an 800-pound gorilla in the room: Given present trends, within about a century, Europe will cease to be a white, Christian continent.</p>
<p>{snip} By the year 2150, barring a major shift in either native European fertility rates or immigrant nationality, Europe will be a largely Muslim continent with whites and Christians as minorities composing less than 20 percent of the population. Much of Europe has come to terms with that possibility, but a significant portion of the population is uncomfortable about the prospect of a change in Europe&rsquo;s continental character, warranting wider spread support for xenophobic political parties across the continent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An increasing number of Europeans, however, are demanding change, and are willing to accept a declining population and the consequent economic effects in order to preserve what they see as their heritage. In Amsterdam, women have written editorials decrying the pressure native European women have felt from immigrant communities to cover themselves in public. In France, an extremist xenophobic political party came in second place in the 2002 presidential elections as a result of rising fear about the future of France.</p>
<p>{snip} It seems that Europe has decided that it wants to do something about this perceived problem, but is unwilling to do the one thing that would resolve the long-term demographic situation in a manner that would benefit both native Europeans and immigrants: reproduce.<br/>

			<p>It&rsquo;s all very well for the Euros to protest the intrusion of Islamic barbarians into their continent (and well they should). But the only solution to that problem is to start having babies themselves, and to dedicate their lives to something higher than their own comfort, safety and pleasure. When will they?</p>

			<p>The article makes a mistake: it assumes that European birth rates will remain constant for the next century. But birth rates go up and down (that&rsquo;s a fact). Once Europeans come to the realization that they are being out-bred and replaced by Muslims, it&rsquo;s very likely their low birth rates will be reversed substantially.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No civilization has ever recovered from such a population decline, and never before has such a decline been entirely voluntary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voluntary?  Hmmmm.  Maybe so, maybe not so.  Who invented &#8216;feminism&rsquo;, and then used that twisted and unnatural ideology as a weapon pointed at the heads of one particular group of women?  Who have worked 24/7 for the last 40-50 years to brainwash the women of one particular group to view their natural mates as competitors, oppressors, and as &#8216;bad guys&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Who taught them that &#8216;nice guys&rsquo; who had good careers, good character, and who were hard working and loyal to their women and to their families - were &#8216;boring&rsquo;, so dull and old-fashioned? </p>
<p> Who has used their control of the media to demean, ridicule, demonize, and belittle the MEN of a certain group - and to try to turn their women against them?  Who dominates the field of lawyers, and who reaps ENORMOUS profits by turning marriage into an adversarial contest - pitting husband against wife in divorce courts?  Which puts incredible amounts of apprehension in the heads of men,  who begin to see marriage as dangerous risk to them, instead of viewing it in a healthy, natural fashion?   </p>
<p>Who has engineered WWI, WWII, The Korean War, Viet Nam, Gulf War I, and this Iraq fiasco - which has seen hundreds of millions of European men lose their lives and therefore never have the opportunity to become fathers?</p>
<p>Who is right now agitating for America to start another insane and unnecessary war with Iran?   Who pushes abortion on demand, and morning-after-pills, to make sure no fertilized egg slips through the crack?  (No pun intended)</p>
<p>No, Mr. Wagener.  Nice try.  But, it hasn&rsquo;t been &#8216;entirely voluntary&rsquo;. Unless you are factoring in the mind boggling degree of stupidity of the people in question, to be dumb enough to not recognize what was being done to them and by who. </p>
<p>Volunteering to participate in your own genocide, is, I suppose, &#8216;voluntary&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an observation that I wonder how many other AR readers and pro-white nationalist groups might have also noticed.  When the topic of abortion comes up, I&rsquo;ve personally listened to white women  - who by all other measurements would fall into the traditional conservative camp - and yet, these very women will get this &#8216;look&rsquo; in their eyes and expression on their faces that is almost Satanic in appearance - and the hostility and anger that pours out of their mouths - directed at anyone who might want to prevent them from aborting their inconvenient fetuses - this is truly a frightening sight to behold.  At least, for a white male who&rsquo;s aware of these statistics and who understands what the implications are for our people, long term.  </p>
<p>Abortion seems to be an issue that only White Women are obsessed with; I seldom see non-white women spewing such venom and anger over this issue.  So, the logical mind would absorb this phenomena - and begin to wonder:  Who programmed our women to despise and care so little about the fetuses that white men have fertilized?</p>
<p>Is this part of something that is philosophically deeper than anyone has ever imagined?  </p>

			<p>Widespread birth control device availability (the pill) is the main reason. Another seldom mentioned aspect of the problem is that whites in Europe and elsewhere realize that their subverted social and political systems are dedicated to their ultimate demise; they thus see no future in having progeny. As a result, they simply don&rsquo;t breed well in captivity!</p>

			<p>I will be gone by the time the demographic crisis can affect me any worse. I don&rsquo;t want to raise or leave children in a world like this.  In the beginning, if some small steps would have been taken to slow the third world/minority/immigrant take-overs in every continent, maybe there would not have to be articles written that try to shame white Christian women into having children. I won&rsquo;t pretend that I can make up for universal past mistakes. Thank goodness there is more to look forward to than just having children in this life. </p>

			<p>&#8221; &hellip;willing to accept a declining population and the consequent economic effects in order to preserve what they see as their heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea that population must keep growing is a lie.  There are a great many benefits of a shrinking population, including little need to build new infrastructure (new roads, power plants, water &amp; sewage systems, new schools, etc.).  In addition, education costs drop, as does real estate.  Imagine the costs of housing if suddenly 1/2 of the people in your city were gone.  Population reduction removes pressure from the environment   &mdash;   reduced pollution, logging, water use, sewage release, agriculture, &amp; sprawl.  It improves quality of life, such as traffic congestion. Of course, there must be adjustments to the economy, such as movement of workers from construction and teaching to health care and aged-care.  But those are not difficult problems.</p>
<p>There are four reasons why the elites tell us that population decline is bad: (1) they need more people in order to make more profits.  (2) They want cheap labor. (3) Socialists, one-worlders, and religious fanatics want to save the poor by bringing them into your nation.  (4) Governments want more taxpayers.</p>
<p>Lower population is good, unless that population loss is replaced by immigration of a different race and culture.</p>

			<p>Historically, the only reason to have children was to have someone to take care of you in your old age or else to avenge your premature death. Now that socialist governments in Europe and elsewhere have taken over these functions, there is no reason to have children.</p>

			<p>In my experience, people in America hardly even get married anymore.</p>
<p>I suppose Europe is the same, perhaps even more so.</p>
<p>As a Christian, I married the woman I knew that God had given to me. We had children because we thought it would be neat to see a bunch of hybrids  &mdash;  entities composed of her and me! We did this because we loved each other (and still do). But even more than that, we were given the privilege of creating new life. What an extroadinary privilege, priceless beyond silver or gold!</p>
<p>We dedicated ourselves to our children (what else could we do?) and they have excelled.</p>
<p>It is sad to see Europeans give up Christian marriage and parenthood for some cheap tinsel. </p>
<p>One day, when they are older, they will realize that they gave it all away  &mdash;  gave away something priceless, something that can never be reclaimed, an eternal loss with no consolation.</p>
<p>As for me and my family, we will serve the Lord.     </p>

			<p>This is how abortion, feminism, and liberalism are destroying Europeans.  If abortion were not legal in those countries, many babies would have been born.  If feminism did not instruct women to put their career before their children, more children would have been conceived.  And if liberalism did not cause these societies to be poor in spirit, they would not need to import foreigners who do not share their culture.  Abortion is one of the single worst injuries to Europeans.</p>

			<p>2150 is a long ways off in predicting European population trends.  I&rsquo;ve grown suspicious to any kind of doom and gloom about Europe as a pretext to allowing nonwhite immigration.  Neoconservatives in particular salivate over the prospect of muslims taking over Europe.  </p>

			<p>Materialism, consumerism and affluence is PART of the problem. </p>
<p>But the MOST damaging thing ever done to Whites (American, European, Canadian, Australian, etc) was to take away their sense of racial identity. Since WWII, the deliberate and sustained effort to &#8220;de-racialize&#8221; white people has finally had it&rsquo;s effect and it&rsquo;s devastating. </p>
<p>A people who are no longer able to even THINK of themselves as a people are doomed to extinction. What a terrible, terrible tragic loss. </p>

			<p>I understand why the vast majority of whites are not reproducing: they are irrational, self-loathing idiots. </p>
<p>Many of these people are not aware (even on an unconscious level) of what is happening to our race, which doesn&rsquo;t really surprise me.  </p>
<p>What does surprise me is the fact that even the more rational whites: business people, foreign policy hawks, top politicians, right-leaning intellectuals, etc. are all enthusiastically supporting what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think these people realize the great danger being a racial minority poses. One that is likely to be hated and despised by the overwhelmingly non-white majority beneath them.</p>
<p>Unlike the white elites down in South America and in other parts of the world, they won&rsquo;t have a majority white America or Europe to come bail them out if the &#8220;natives&#8221; ever decide they want Whitey&rsquo;s head on a stick.</p>
<p>This is what I find most disturbing about what is happening. </p>

<p>Then QUIT WRITING EDITORIALS and get busy having children! Good god, sometimes I wonder if White Europeans ARE more intelligent or HAVE more common sense, because SIMPLE MATH dicates that if you don&rsquo;t reproduce, then YOU DIE OFF. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Less thinking (and writing), White women, and MORE REPRODUCING is in order to save the day! As Pat Buchanan so rightfully states, &#8220;Demographics is Destiny&#8221;. This isn&rsquo;t rocket science, folks.</p>

			<p>From everything I&rsquo;ve ever read the white people of Europe and of the U.S. never wanted nonwhite immigrants. It&rsquo;s not the people but the elites that are destroying whites. Let&rsquo;s get real. The people have no say in what goes on. It&rsquo;s the new world order people who want this. Once the federal Reserve was allowed the new worlders had all the money they needed to destroy whites. Notice how it wasn&rsquo;t until the Federal reserve act (1913 I believe) that the stuff hit the fan? WWI,WWII, the communist takeover of Rusia etc. The money was theirs to do what they wanted to do. Unless the Federal reserve is done away with they will continue to have the power through money.</p>

			<p>Those Europeans who wish to continue to exist should ordain themselves an aristocracy, and take the aristocratic privilege of impregnating all of the women of the new peasant class.  Those who refuse to meet the societal obligation to procreate have no claim on the conscience of those who do the truly essential work of civilization.  The fact is, Europe will be taken over by hard White men who will put the soft, childless and childish majority to work, or it will be taken over by hard Moslem men who will put the soft Whites to death.  </p>

			<p>I think Europe has a problem but I think it&rsquo;s greatly exaggerated.  The continent is densely populated and overcrowded and a little depopulation wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad thing as long as immigration was kept in check.  2/3 of Europeans gone in 150 years.  I doubt it.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s over a million abortions every year in Europe.  The birthrate could be doubled overnight by paying women a hefty sum to carry their baby to term and then turning it over to the state for adoption placement.  All medical expenses paid and payment of salary for any work missed because of pregnancy.  It&rsquo;s that simple. </p>
<p>On a side note, I don&rsquo;t know if anyone is paying attention to the news but the Euro just closed at around $1.50 today.  The continued strength of the Euro against the dollar means that very soon dollar denominated assets are going to be dumped in favor of Euros.  I am talking about the end of the dollar as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency.  Europe was the financial hub of the world right up until 1920 when the US took over the role.  That role is now reverting back across the Atlantic with serious consequences for the US as a continuing economic and military power.  I honestly believe that Europe and other parts of the Caucasian world will see increasing immigration from the US over the next decades as the economy worsens and there is increasing social strife from the changing demographics.  I&rsquo;m planning on leaving myself in the next 5 years.  I just can&rsquo;t see America surviving intact in the face of all this Mexican immigration and high black birth rates.     </p>

			<p>Young girls are indoctrinated/guided in the public schools from the earliest age to despise motherhood and instead to &#8220;fulfill&#8221; themselves in various &#8220;professions&#8221; away from the home. Motherhood is never presented to them as an honorable alternative profession itself. That is very UN-PC. So textbooks are NEVER allowed to portray the traditional family.<br/>
This, coupled with the destruction of the traditional church and cohesive communities and morality and widespread abortion and contraception, is why this self-genocide is occurring EVERYWHERE. It seems the only whites reproducing are white Muslim societies.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;The article makes a mistake: it assumes that European birth rates will remain constant for the next century. But birth rates go up and down (that&rsquo;s a fact). Once Europeans come to the realization that they are being out-bred and replaced by Muslims, &#8220;<br/>

			<p>The TRUE problem is not low birth rates but immigration. Japan has even lower birth rates but zero immigration, thus the Japanese are not being replaced. There may be a decline in absolute numbers but the proportion of the population that is ethnically Japanese remains the same. It wouldn&rsquo;t matter if Europe had a population of 800 million or 550 million if the population was 100% White European, but when you allow a foreign group into your country they become demographic competition for your land and could end up displacing you. Japan&rsquo;s population may drop from its current 127 million to &#8220;only&#8221; 100 million in fifty years BUT IT WILL BE ALL JAPANESE.</p>

			<p>European poulations were crashing at the beginning of the 20th century as well, with predictions that 90% of the current population would vanish in a little over a century. We&rsquo;re all still here if anybody hasn&rsquo;t noticed, and in greater numbers than then, even after the war to kill white people of the world I and II, even after flu pandemic and starvation. This is all nonsense, no one can predict the future from such a short term trend. The long term history of the European peoples has always been one of overall progress and survival in the face of overwhelming odds. I choose to have children (2 sons in 3 years&hellip;so far) with my wife as an affirmation of our lives and a challenge to those who would displace us. We are not the only ones having kids with the same idea in mind. There are many we know personally. I believe in my folk, I have no fear for the future.</p>

			<p>Agree with post 8:04pm 2/29.  Lower population is good if there is no migration from other cultures.  The quality of life can be improved and this nation made a better life for citizens by reductions in births after industrial revolution. Immigrations are what keep population increases in USA. Those who go crazy over whites not reproducing enough need to understand that white aspire for a better life for all. . Advanced cultures exist to improve their lives. Slow and steady population growth improves lives and stability of a culture. Now, it seems everything is a race to quantity. Quality is left out of the equation.  This is why USA is beginning to appear a 3rd rate nation.  It is because rapid population increases create poverty.  Jobs and quality of life can not keep up.  Real growth comes from fewer people with higher incomes;<br/>
Not more people and lower incomes. There is no chance whites will stop reproducing as nature assures reproductions will occur. Unfortunately immigration laws are sorely neglected.  V</p>

			<p><i>There are a great many benefits of a shrinking population</i></p>
<p>Only if it doesn&rsquo;t happen too fast. When population shrinks too fast, as it has in the developed world, a country finds itself sitting on a demographic time bomb. We have a lot of people who just about to get too old to work, and not enough young people at the bottom of the pyramid to support them. Of course, this is one of the arguments for immigration: we need more people at the bottom of the pyramid. However, this solution to the demographic crisis can only work if the immigrants we let in pay more taxes than what they cost the government, which they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>This is really the gist of it. things like the sucking of our wealth by the federal reserve has induced widespread poverty. Look at russia. Again with poverty comes low reproduction by the intelligent. Who wants to raise kids in a tiny apartment? Real estate prices have gone through the roof due to massive immigration. Blacks are violent out of control and it is hushed up. hispanics and blacks get PAID to have more children, being on public assistance programs, to them it is a strong incentive to have many kids. There is also the horrific divorce laws where women rape men financially for life. Men are terrified of marriage now. it is because we have a federal reserve sucking money from our debts, the war engine sucking more, the underclasses sucking ever more, that the basic workers give up on having children when it takes 2 parents working to survive. its just that simple</p>

			<p>The combination of demonizing white racial identity and the subsequent enslavement of whites to other races through socialist programs that force them to support the others before themselves has no doubt had a negative impact on white populations. </p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m with &#8220;12:27 AM March 1&#8221;.  Challenges are real, problems are real; but everyone alive today is by their very existence proof of the success of every generation that went before.  </p>
<p>I approve of sounding the alarm to wake people to a threat, but I strongly disapprove of pessimism and self-loathing.  Predictions of imminent extinction have so far all been quite wrong, and I am optimistic because I have faith in the people.<br/>
We can meet any challenge, overcome any threat, and accomplish anything we set our minds to.  This is not even &#8220;faith&#8221;, really- because it has been proven so many times, over so many years &amp; generations. </p>
<p>To the fellow that says: &#8220;Do we even deserve to live?&#8221;, I must say: What do you mean, &#8220;We&#8221;?  Don&rsquo;t look at me when you say that.  You may have rejected life, I have not. </p>
<p>Please understand, if you have become so despondent, I&rsquo;m not here to kick you down any further. I mean to wake you up, if I can. I am concerned for you and hope you will snap out of it, and realize all that you can do for the good- your own, &amp; that of your community.</p>
<p>I hope what you will wake up to is a brighter future, which is eagerly waiting for those who will bring it into being.  You do, and we do, have the strength to make it so, if we but will. </p>
<p>We often do not realize how much we impact those around us, or we forget- so let me remind you, my friend. </p>
<p>Remember that if you make yourself a better person, you have already made the world a better place.  I know you can do so, and so do you.  I want to see you stand, straight &amp; tall, with passion for life &amp; pride in yourself and your people a burning beacon in your eyes.</p>
<p>It is that light which from which the darkness must retreat.  It is a law of nature, the darkness cannot overcome it.  As this fire in your soul lights up your eyes, and your straight back and confident stride shows your strength and pride, you will inspire others. That light will be reflected back at you in their eyes- whether they are your neighbors or your own children.  </p>
<p>I want you to look squarely into the the eyes of the next strong, white man you should have occasion to meet.  Stand straight and tall, smile broadly, and offer a firm grip in your handshake. Take note of the strength you see- it is not his alone. </p>
<p>He is your reflection.  </p>
<p>You can be absolutely sure that white women find strong, confident white men to be very attractive.  Whether you are at a point in life to raise a family, or be a model to everyone of why white people can &amp; should be proud, you are helping. </p>
<p>When you strengthen yourself by taking on problems and challenges, and even facing setbacks without complaint, but rather a cool determination to see things through, you are helping.  </p>
<p>And you are helping when you speak against the travesty that is the attempted smothering of all the most successful cultures of mankind, but please do so with confidence, knowing that it will not stand, because you and I and those like us  stand against it. </p>
<p>The darkness will not, can not, stand against the light.  </p>

			<p>Europe is overpopulated and the natives feel that and reduce their birth rates, we white people had to survive ice ages and hard climate for most of our history, we are not like southern people who simply reproduce as much as possible and than let the surplus simply die off when the resources run low.</p>
<p>Our ancestors would never have survived with such unconsciousness animal-like behavior! We have to send those people home who do not belong here. Once the population density goes down, the quality of living will rise sharply and Europeans will again increase their reproduction rates. Europe is home to most of the countries in the world with the highest population density, we need not more but less people! Europeans are no Asians who can live with 20 people in a box without complaining, we need space! Why should we want more people anyway? Less people means less to share with and an increasing quality of living!</p>
<p>An increase of population always makes the chains of serfdom heavier, render life more and more expensive, and deepens the abyss which separates the class that commands and enjoys from the class that obeys and suffers!</p>

			<p>As a commenter noted above, birth rates go up and down. If France,  say, went back down to 18 million Frenchmen in 50 years, given the right conditions (paramount, the lack of competing ethnies on their soil) they could quickly make up for their losses in a couple of generations.<br/>
 Or the population could just stabilize at that mark. The lower the population, the higher the GDP per head. </p>
<p>Alarmists whining about declining European  birth rates are either completely deluded about the real threat (i.e., non-Europeans competing for limited resources), or ultimately socialist supporters of the Welfare State.</p>

<p>Where I work, there are eight women in my department, seven White and one hispanic. Of the seven White women, only two of them have children, a total of only three between both of them&hellip;and neither has any plans to have any more. The hispanic woman is married to a White male and although they don&rsquo;t have children, nor plan to, her sister, who is also 100% hispanic and is married to a 100% hispanic male, is infertile, so she decided to get an egg donor&hellip;FROM A WHITE FEMALE. She had twins, both with dominant Caucasian features and White as snow.</p>
<p>Perhaps THAT is the way to save the White race&hellip;have White women sell their eggs to light-skinned non-Whites so they can get, in return, what is <b>REALLY</b> important to them, <b>MONEY</b>. Then they can go out and consume some more, party, etc., just like their heroines on the show &#8220;Sex in the City&#8221;. Hmmm&hellip;I think we have a solution here.</p>

<i>2150 is a long way off in predicting European population trends. I&rsquo;ve grown suspicious of any kind of doom and gloom about Europe as a pretext for allowing nonwhite immigration.<br/>
Posted by at 8:44 PM</i></p>
<p>Agreed.  So have I (grown suspicious).  Fifty years is a long way ahead.  Who would have thought, if visiting the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe only 20 years ago, that today all of that would be gone and utterly transformed?</p>
<p>Just consider this:  Only fifty years ago, who could possibly have predicted  the situation we Westerners are facing now?  Any such prediction would have been considered extravagant or outright insane.  We are  actually witnessing &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221; coming true before our eyes.  Did  (most) people take the book serviously back then?  It was viewed as a wildly alarmist piece of fiction and laughed at as absurdly improbable (and that wasn&rsquo;t even 50 years ago).  Now the fiction is becoming fact.</p>
<p> <i>Neoconservatives in particular salivate over the prospect of muslims taking over Europe.  </i></p>
<p>Yes, indeed.  Isn&rsquo;t that peculiar? How odd.  Especially considering who many of those neoconservative ideologues tend to be.  It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re puncuring holes in the liferaft they&rsquo;re riding in, and they&rsquo;re oblivious to it.  Moslems will not be kind to them. But even so, they still value Diversity so highly, above all else, that they are determined to achieve it, and impose it on the rest of us, at any  price.</p>
<p>And as for some others among those neoconservatives, well, I suppose if you assume that God is going scoop you all up and carry you off to Heaven at any moment soon, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about holes in the liferaft. Your salvation is guaranteed and the future is not a matter of concern.  But what about the rest of us who don&rsquo;t believe that and who take a more realistic view of this world? Whether we like it or not, we in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>I agree with the one person who said that whites can&rsquo;t afford more kids b/c they&rsquo;re paying for the welfare of others. People want a standard of living and think of the future of the kids they have. Other ethnic groups don&rsquo;t worry about getting all (or any) of their kids into college. </p>

			<p>I disagree vehemently that population loss is &#8216;healthy&rsquo; or &#8216;good&rsquo; in any way.  Anyone who values their own life, is a priori obliged to admit that an equal number of living people next generation would also enjoy their lives.  It is pure selfishness, it is not for &#8216;their own good,&rsquo; for people to never be born and never participate in life.  Worst of all, it is our best and brightest who have the fewest children, making this population loss particularly dysgenic and devastating.</p>
<p>Overpopulation might be a problem, but replacement level breeding is a sign of a healthy and good people who doesn&rsquo;t hate themselves or wish to die.  Under replacement level breeding is a statement of self-loathing and despair.  It is also pointless to stop having children when immigration just takes your land anyway.  Furthermore, the very reason immigration is allowed and encouraged is BECAUSE no one&rsquo;s having children.  Europe is therefore bringing all its problems upon itself.</p>
<p>I do not think this trend is going to magically turn around once the population hits some &#8216;perfect number.&rsquo;  Whatever is causing people to hate life and selfishly ignore the future for the sake of the present, will only continue and redouble.  Hasn&rsquo;t this low birthrate gone on for multiple generations now?  Every generation raised in socialism, feminism, etc will only be weaker than the one before it.  Brainwashed at an early age, they&rsquo;ll only be more likely to accept immigration, high taxes, and casual sex with no children.  It&rsquo;s a downward spiral.  As the article says, NO population has ever recovered from such a mass die-off.</p>

			<p><i>  Many people are not aware (even on an unconscious level) of what is happening to our race, which doesn&rsquo;t really surprise me. </i></p>
<p><i>  What does surprise me is the fact that even the more rational whites: business people, foreign policy hawks, top politicians, right-leaning intellectuals, etc., are all enthusiastically supporting what&rsquo;s going on.  I don&rsquo;t think these people realize the great danger being a racial minority poses. One that is likely to be hated and despised by the overwhelmingly non-white majority beneath them.<br/>
Posted by David Bolingbroke </i></p>
<p>Yes, it is surprising. It is simply amazing.  I think they&rsquo;ve never really thought about it, surely not deeply, because talking  - or even thinking  - about such things is discouraged and made to seem shameful.   People  today would feel guilty about racist thoughts.  So the whole unpleasant subject is brushed aside as being outside the limits of decent thought   &mdash;    and certainly of respectable conversation. I suppose that to most younger people, under 40,  after a lifetime of &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; indoctrination, entertaining such thoughts is worse than having pornographic fantasies. Only &#8220;ornery&#8221; people like us here at Amren dare to cross that line and confront the tabooed topic of race.</p>
<p>As for us becoming not just a minority, but one that is furthermore <i> &#8220;likely to be hated and despised by the overwhelmingly non-white majority&#8221; &hellip;. </i>  what is truly incredible  to contemplate is that we are  (or some of our  so-called &#8220;elites&#8221; are)  actually TEACHING those non-whites to nurse a grudge and assume that all their problems are because of us.  And they are teaching OUR children to feel guilty about it!   This evil policy is a madness that someday will bear bitter fruit. I&rsquo;m glad I won&rsquo;t be around by then to see it.  I pity those who will. </p>
<p>(And too bad also that Susan Sontag, Noel Ignatief, et al won&rsquo;t be around either, to have to taste that bitter fruit   &mdash;    which they have planted. Those subversives, haters, and revolutionaries who are put across to us as &#8220;intellectuals&#8221;  [I would vigorougly dispute that word!] are, as usual, the authors of the coming troubles which they will not be around to experience.)</p>

Since Abortion aka infanticide was legalised in the UK in the 1960s more than 6 million babies have been slaughtered at the altar of feminism. If abortion was never legalised white fertility would be a lot closer to replacement level now.</p>

			<p>Maybe white people just don&rsquo;t want kids anymore? In school girls are encouraged to have great careers, travel and generally live the &#8220;sex and the city&#8221; lifestyle, being a mother is looked upon as &#8220;damaging&#8221; to their lifestyle. In my office here in London its only the white women who tend to be childless, the Indians, blacks, muslim etc women all have at least two kids. Many white western women leave child bearing too late and then desperately try for that one kid at the fertility clinic. I don&rsquo;t believe immigration is totally to blame simply because the eastern european nations all have low birth rates with zero third world intake. For those who say its quality not quantity I just don&rsquo;t buy that, simply said would you prefer an army of 100,000 young men or one million. Western nations now have large third world populations, its not going to change any time soon so keeping a demographic majority is crucial, I don&rsquo;t want to be a despised minority in my own country.       </p>

			<p>&lsquo;I am man. Hear me roar. I chose to have sex with that woman to have my child.&rsquo; As a white woman who has never reproduced, this is the attitude that I will not tolerate from a white man. With God first; love, respect, and encouragement should go both ways to be a suitable couple to raise a child (to enrich the child&rsquo;s and a couple&rsquo;s life, not just to help populate the white race).</p>

<p>   When you are sitting alone in the nursing home decades from now (at least you&rsquo;ll have lot of other old White ladies who also did not reproduce there with you), you will have a lot of time to remember all the things you would not &#8220;tolerate,&#8221; and why you never got married and had kids.<br/>
   But at least you&rsquo;ll have your black and brown caregivers to keep you entertained while they slap you abound and call you racial names! <br/>

			<p>SIMPLE MATH dicates that if you don&rsquo;t reproduce, then YOU DIE OFF. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. </p>

<p>That is so true   &mdash;   although I&rsquo;m not sure that Buchanan was the first to say it.  It is certainly worth repeating, however.  It&rsquo;s just as clear as 2+2 = 4. </p>
<p>As for those who say this isn&rsquo;t a baby-making contest&hellip;.    Well, it seems that it IS a contest   &mdash;   at least on the other side, the immigrant side, that is. THEY are having a contest with us, even if WE are not.  And they are WINNNING it!   </p>
<p>Meanwhile, we overlook this and we are foolishly PAYING them to reproduce even more   &mdash;   and even to have MULTIPLE wives and families, which we support!   Sheer, suicidal  madness on our part!   </p>
<p>I agree that without these immigrants, Europe could afford to see it&rsquo;s population decline   &mdash;   and that might be all for the good.   But not while immigrants are allowed (even encouraged!)  to come pouring in to make up the shortfall in white babies. </p>
<p>Anyway, for those who claim  that having more white babies is not THE solution, I would say that there isn&rsquo;t any one, single solution. To say that this thing or that thing is not THE solution is erroneous.  There are many approaches to this problem   &mdash;   all of them valid. </p>
<p>Having more babies is one of them.  Reducing immigration is one of them. Having a repatriation program is one of them.   Et cetera.   In fact, nothing less than a comprehensive,  multi-faceted, overall approach to the problem will ever be adequate. Anything less is just tinkering with the problem and applying a Bandaid.</p>

			<p>Actually, productivity growth is so high that declining populations shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.  So maybe in 100 years we will only have 1/4th the population we have now - so what?  The only problem I can see is that we&rsquo;ll have a higher ratio of dependents (retired people) to workers.  But if productivity grows at a modest 1% per year - far below the 20th century average - one worker will be able to support 2.7 times as many people as he does now, which will more than cancel out the additional number of retirees he has to support.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not quite true that no society has ever voluntarily severely reduced its population before.  Sparta did just that.  The problem then was that Sparta ended up with less than 1000 soldiers, and was eaten up by its neighbors.  But even now a country with a nuclear arsenal can defend its borders regardless of how small its army is compared with that of another country, and within the next century robots and drones will probably replace most soldiers anyway.  So there&rsquo;s really no reason to be alarmed about low birth rates - except that they give ammo to pro-immigrant forces in debates.</p>

			<p>If we look at the world today, there are more than 6.5 billion people living on earth, most of them third-worlders who continue to multiply rapidly. Whites are a shrinking minority among the world population.<br/>
The abundance of 3rd world countries&rsquo; population and the prosperity of the white west induce a huge immigration pressure into the west. However, Europe, USA and the rest of the white world have the means to restrain the influx of 3rd worlders, but apparently - thanks to the liberal indoctrination, people developed a desire to embrace the migration of unproductive non-whites, forgetting about the rising costs they pay themselves for resources, welfare, safety&hellip;<br/>
Now we have already too much fertile 3rd worlders who continue to grow relentlessly, and the difference in the birth rate between the newcomers and the natives will naturally lead to colonization.<br/>
We got all the phony explanations from the ruling elite on the necessity of immigrants - &#8220;the population is shrinking, we need more labor to support our economy&#8221;, etc. But I&rsquo;m asking myself have the advocators of mass immigration thought what will happen when the economy will not be thriving as it does today, when there will be a recession, or worser, when there will be any shortage in resources like food or energy?  What then?<br/>
Then the immigrants will have to share scarce resources with the native population, which is likely to result in conflicts and civil war. What happens if Europe will have no money for paying welfare to the muslims who are colonizing the continent? They will go out to the streets and start rioting. And then? What will the politicians do? I know - blame the whites for not working enough to create tax money for welfare. What seems to be peaceful, doesn&rsquo;t need to stay it that way all the time. In the early days, Yugoslavia was known as an example of a peaceful multicultural society. How has it ended?<br/>
The same goes for Kenia, which was praised as an prime exemple for a thriving country in Africa. And now?<br/>
What I want to say: With the increasing population of the unproductive 3rd world and the descrasing population of the productive members of our society, it will be only a question of time until battles for resources erupt, simply because the earth can&rsquo;t feed an unlimited size of population. And once people start to battle for resources vis-a-vis, they won&rsquo;t care about human rights as they do today.<br/>
Deriving these consequences, it would be wise for any civilized countriy to throw out hostile invaders back to where they came from and close the borders, because homogeneity reduces the risk of ethnic violence. But now we are too far away from having a leader who has the guts even to speak this out.</p>

			<p>I pray everyday for Europe and Russia.  I&rsquo;m still trying to decide if we should move our family to &#8220;middle of no where&#8221; America or back to Europe. </p>
<p>But the pros and cons.  Both Europe and the US are in the same situation in regards to immigration.  In America you have the second Amendment, not so in Europe.  In America you have lots more land, but Europe is tight and crowded.  But white America is nothing more than a cash cow for elitists.  And white America is now looked upon as second rate citizens.  &#8220;Just shut up and pay your taxes and buy stuff!&#8221; </p>
<p>You know, I just do NOT feel valued by America anymore. </p>
<p>I want to be a part of something bigger than myself and be a good productive patriotic citizen.  Why should my skills, taxes and consumer dollars continue to go to America - which doesn&rsquo;t value me &hellip; when it could go to a European country that may sooner value it? </p>
<p>Most European countries are small thus they should be more easily influenced by citizens.  My wife thinks we should move to Europe in part to &#8220;wake people up&#8221;, but I hate long airplane flights and our parents are getting old. Plus, my family has fought in several American wars and worked hard to build America.  Part of me feels conflicted about leaving because of their sacrifices. Your thoughts?</p>

White people on Amren like to think of themselves as superior by constantly hammering blacks for having a lower IQ but at least we blacks have some racial solidarity and haven&rsquo;t become so self absorbed that we don&rsquo;t want to reproduce. T&#8221;</p>
<p>But you are self absorbed enough not to care about what happens to the child after you conceive it, out of wedlock usually.  You don&rsquo;t place any value on your kids and instead look to Whites to do that for you.  Most children is foster care are black by the way.    </p>

			<p>&#8220;The TRUE problem is not low birth rates but immigration. Japan has even lower birth rates but zero immigration, thus the Japanese are not being replaced. &#8220;<br/>

The Japanese didn&rsquo;t listen to the same pied pipers that we did.  Or maybe the Japanese were not the object of the pied pipers&rsquo; designs.   </p>
<p>First we whites were told (by the people who are always advising us on how we should live) that Americans and all white people in general  were having too many children, that we were irresponsible, that we were over-populating and were polluting the earth and stressing the ecology.  We were hogging all the resources of the earth. We should be ashamed of our selfishness.  So, we stopped having large families and we reduced the birthrate.   Then, we were told that Social Security is about to fail, that we desperately need more producers and consumers to support the economy and sustain &#8220;growth&#8221;, and that we need more immigrants  (great numbers of them)  to fill the jobs that Americans aren&rsquo;t available to fill, or are incapable to do; that we should have open borders and invite in the world.</p>

			<p> &#8220;On a side note, I don&rsquo;t know if anyone is paying attention to the news but the Euro just closed at around $1.50 today. The continued strength of the Euro against the dollar means that very soon dollar denominated assets are going to be dumped in favor of Euros. I am talking about the end of the dollar as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency. Europe was the financial hub of the world right up until 1920 when the US took over the role. That role is now reverting back across the Atlantic.&#8221;<br/>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Excellent comment.  Thank you for mentioning that.  In France, there was a front-page article in Le Monde, early this week, noting the euro&rsquo;s historic breakthrough.  I wonder if the US press covered that development.  Towards the end of the week,  the euro continued its climb to almost $1.54.   And the dollar, of course, has continued its fall.  Only several years ago you could get a euro for  about 70 cents (US).  Amazing.  Any American living abroad can notice the difference.  What was affordable only last year has become expensive this year. I suppose that Americans with  limited means may have to give up any hope of seeing Europe. For them, it will be an impossibility. </p>
<p>Another hot topic in the French press right now is the soaring cost of food   &mdash;   already exhorbitant by American standards.  That means that if it&rsquo;s getting still more expensive for Europeans who can buy with euros, it&rsquo;s going to cost EVEN MORE for Americans with their feeble dollars.  Even American-produced food will be exported where it can earn more money abroad.    Bad news for all, but especially for Americans.</p>
<p>Regarding the comment above about Wall Street becoming the financial hub of the world following the First WW,  there was an article in one of the Swiss newspapers about a year ago noting that the European exchanges had for the first time since then (nearly a century) surpassed the Americans in the total value of securities traded   &mdash;   another historic marking point, for those who are noticing such things.  I don&rsquo;t know if the American press took note of that either.  But all the signs are on the wall.</p>
<p>There was a prescient article in a business magazine last November about a well-known billionaire investor, Jim Rogers, founder of the Quantum Fund, who stated that he had already converted all his assets into euros, and was in fact thinking of selling his mansion on Riverside Drive in New York (it&rsquo;s listed for sale at $15 million, I see on the Internet), and moving  his residence to Shanghai, which he expects to become the new world financial center.  This is a man who is known for making shrewd predictions and has gotten very rich from them.  He is rarely wrong.  </p>
<p>He has even employed a Chinese nanny for his four-year-old daughter; she speaks to the child only in Chinese.  And the little girl is allowed to view television ONLY in Chinese.  She is already fluent. He states that he won&rsquo;t be buying  any American stocks at this point and that a recession is already well overdue.  &#8220;As recently as the 1980s, we were still a creditor nation. We&rsquo;re now the largest debtor nation that the world has ever seen. We owe the world $13 trillion!  My daughter already has her own Swiss bank account, because someday she will have to support me.&#8221;  We used to own the world;  now we owe the world.  Yes, the writing is on the wall, for anyone who will read it.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not that Whites aren&rsquo;t getting together and bringing about pregnancies in America.  </p>
<p>The problem is that since 1973 50,000,000 abortions have occurred.  Of that number, 2/3&rsquo;s is estimated to have been of White babies.  Thus, take 33,000,000 White kids who would likely have married and had several children of their own and- presto -no population drain in this country.  </p>
<p>Then again, pregnancies appear to have been little inconveniences to some of the selfish among our race. </p>

There are no havens left in America anymore whether you live in Maine or Alaska or North Dakota.  We didn&rsquo;t have blacks where I live until the government decided to settle some of New Orleans&rsquo; unwashed masses right here in small town America.  I used to think the government just paid lip service to diversity just to placate minorities.  I&rsquo;m not so sure anymore.  The government is predicting 130,000,000 mostly black, brown and yellow people in this country over the coming the coming decades and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll spread to every corner of the US.  </p>

<i>The white people of Europe and of the U.S. NEVER wanted nonwhite immigrants. It&rsquo;s not the people but the elites that are destroying us.  <b>The people have no say </b> in what goes on. It&rsquo;s the new world order people who want this. </i><br/>

Exactly.  It is a vociferous and determined few who ram their programs through and get their way,  usually done under the cloak of &#8220;democracy&#8221;.  It really has nothing to do with democracy or the wishes of the people.</p>
<p>I once witnessed a small-scale but perfect example of this.  About 20 years ago, I attended a neighborhood association meeting. I was only a guest there. The meeting was supposed to be strictly about local neighborhood problems: parking, schools, etc.  </p>
<p>This happened to be at a time when the Navy was planning to built a submarine base somewhat nearby (in another community). The Communists and anti-war front groups were absolutely opposed to it.   But this matter did not concern the neighborhood association at all.  One woman there, obviously a militant Communist and a hyperactive organizer,  was determined to put this item on the agenda ANYWAY and to get a resolution condemning it   &mdash;    even though it was entirely outside the scope of the meeting.  Furthermore, most people in the room did not want to touch the issue and they were not against the submarine base either.   They were also leery that this was a communist move on her part, and  I remember them whispering nervously about that amongst themselves. </p>
<p>However that one militant woman was DETERMINED to have her way.  She SHOUTED DOWN anyone who disagreed with her. She insulted them, she abused them, she bullied them.  She could get really nasty, and she plainly had them all intimidated.  After all, these were neighbors and they wanted to get along with each other They weren&rsquo;t looking for fights..  They wanted to avoid any unpleasantness, and she took advantage of this.  Most people retreated into silence, not wanting to get into an argument with her.  So then they took a vote, and nobody dared vote against her. Her resolution won simply because of lack of opposition, and I think it was then sent to Congress or the local senator as representing  the popular wish of the community   &mdash;    when in fact it was nothing of the kind.  It was just HER idea.</p>
<p>Her anti-navy  resolution passed, and after the meeting I recall one of the people there privately chiding her:  &#8220;You know what you just did, don&rsquo;t you?&#8221;    She  smugly answered, &#8220;Yes, I know.  I RAMMED it through!&#8221;&hellip;. wearing a smile like the cat that just swallowed the canary.</p>
<p>As a guest there, I was not privileged to say anything, but  it was a very instructive lesson for me.  I was learning.   I could see how the Bolsheviks took over Russia with their bullying tactics. After that I have been very leery of these communist/leftist militants who tend to infiltrate and take over meetings, clubs, associations, and turn them into tools for their own purposes   &mdash;   used against the very people they are supposed to represent.</p>
<p>I have seen this same strategy at union meetings also.  For instance, when they  were proposing to send money to  the African National Congress &#8220;to fight apartheid&#8221; in South Africa.  Some people wondered what on earth this had to do with union issues here at home   &mdash;   which is what our union was supposed to fighting for   &mdash;    for OUR interests, not for communist causes on another continent.  But that resolution too passed.</p>
<p>I concluded there is nothing &#8220;democratic&#8221; about the so-called democratic left.  I was, when young and naive, a  well-meaning liberal (as many of us were), but these things were giving me a slow education about reality. Things are not always as they seem; and democratic is not necessarily democratic.</p>

<p>I hear you.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to run from this problem too much longer.  This kills me to say, though I strongly feel the US has already seen its best days and is a dying nation. That is, the one our founding fathers created.  A new one will eventually arise though this will be at the hands of the invaders from the south.  Who knows what whites will do then?  Maybe that will be the day a majority of us finally will wake up.  </p>

			<p>Most of you may not be aware of enormous changes occurring in biotechnology and nanotechnology.  In another twenty years, the progress toward lengthening human life or even reversing old age is going to be astonishing.  Many of us who have not yet had children may actually get a second chance.  I&rsquo;m not kidding.  Check out the books of Ray Kurzweil.  It sounds like science fiction, but it&rsquo;s going to happen.  This will have profound effects on future generations of whites.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I want to be a part of something bigger than myself and be a good productive patriotic citizen. Why should my skills, taxes and consumer dollars continue to go to America - which doesn&rsquo;t value me … when it could go to a European country that may sooner value it? </p>

<p>Well, I would first say that I understand your reasoning regarding our &#8220;fallen republic&#8221; here, but moving to Europe probably won&rsquo;t be that great in the end, given the immense difficulties that they&rsquo;re facing themselves, both racial and socio-economic. They might be a little ahead of our demographic plight at the moment, but they&rsquo;re right on the same path and don&rsquo;t show any REALISTIC signs of overturning this in the long-term. A few minor political parties aren&rsquo;t going to be enough to make the sort of changes that they desperately need. Plus, there&rsquo;s the problem of good employment   &mdash;   unless you&rsquo;re extremely well-qualified (and I&rsquo;m not saying you aren&rsquo;t), it is very hard to get a permanent residence due to the current population situation as it is.</p>
<p>So, in reality, moving to Europe is only a temporary solution for a small few and a non-realistic option for most. Besides, I think that if you&rsquo;re motive in going to Europe is based purely on a fear of the suffering that is UNDENIABLY in store for us Westerners, I would say that you should stay home. Simply put, suffering is GOOD for the soul   &mdash;   it is probably the one thing that Westerners actually NEED the most! And, believe me, in the long-run, NOBODY will avoid the suffering that is rapidly approaching our people, not even those who think that they can neatly insulate themselves forever in their exclusive country clubs and suburban neighborhoods while the rest take the brunt of it. </p>
<p>My ancestors also fought and worked very hard to make this country great. And, in all truthfulness, even if (and most likely WHEN) America goes down, all that really matters is that the best of our people stay alive and propagate themselves into the future. We will still have the capability of building another great civilization even without the &#8220;America&#8221; that exists today. This, however, obviously cannot be said about the other &#8220;Americans&#8221; that have scrambled over here like scavengers in recent decades. So, in my view, the best choice is to stay and fight it out. There are still good places to raise a family, you just have to search more diligently than in the past&hellip;</p>

			<p>I have said this for years now: consumerism kills. In many ways I believe that another great depression would be good for whites and the world in general, things are too out of whack under this globalist corporate hegemony. The globalist ideal started in the West, and it is the first culture it&rsquo;s strangling to death.<br/>
On the other hand, a major economic depression would only hasten a major and popular white backlash against the economic/academic/political elites who have been leading our respective nations off the cliff since the 1950&rsquo;s.         </p>

			<p>Luke&rsquo;s post was excellent and he echoed my sentiments on the unnamed group who has played a pivotal role in the decline of the white race and the nations in which we reside. That isn&rsquo;t to say we bear no responsibility for being such willing dupes and easy prey for their insidious propaganda. </p>
<p>If currents trends continue and whites do not undergo a radical transformation in the way they see the world and other races, then we will be long gone well before 2150.  Whites, for touting their superior I.Q.&rsquo;s continue to be blind, deaf and dumb on racial issues.    </p>
<p>As Western nations continue to be inundated with non-whites and Muslims it&rsquo;s only matter of time before open warfare breaks out. The possibility exists that when whites become 25% or less in any nation they will be facing genocide at the hands of the newly dominant racial and/or religious group.  We&rsquo;re fast becoming Kurds in the nations founded by our forbears.  Most of the world&rsquo;s people are racial and tribally oriented and reject the cosmopolitanism and diversity mongering practiced by decadent white nations.</p>
<p>Whites are truly at the lowest point in their storied history.         </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to stay optimistic. The massive American recession that&rsquo;s been predicted can&rsquo;t be too far away, and the collapse of one country&rsquo;s economy (especially that of a superpower) affects all the others as well. Hopefully once the world economy recedes some Whites will get a backbone.</p>

			<p>Europeans (and most White Americans) are having less children first because of feminist teaching them motherhood is not something to aspire to and also because it is expensive to live in our countries and to raise a family.  We want our kids to have a well-rounded upbringing with a good college education.  These things take money - and we work for it, unlike the invading minorities.  </p>
<p>I like what &#8220;Posted by W.D. at 5:02 AM on March 1&#8221; - we have the power to change things.  Each day I ask myself what have I done to move our people and our country forward?  And now I ask each of you that question.  How many of you are precinct committee officers in your political party?  How many of you have dinner parties and bring up this subject?  How many of you write letters to the editors about this or related subjects?  How many of you take the time from your busy lives to help our cause?</p>
<p>I believe if each of us gets involved in our political parties, we can effect change.  We MUST GET GOOD PEOPLE IN OFFICE.  It is that simple.  Without this, we will have a very hard time of it.</p>

			<p>Sigh, I just plowed through all the available comments, and I can only say that I really hate when these stories are posted. Nothing shows just how little value I have in the eyes of men then to have to read Bible quotes and anecdotes of &#8220;a woman&rsquo;s proper place.&#8221; I am 26, on the short slide to 27; I am single, still trudging through college, and starting to wonder what the Hell I&rsquo;m doing with my life, and what the next step is. I am an atheist, and I have yet been given a convincing arguement that I should find religion; one person told me that if I join the LDS, I&rsquo;ll be married in 18 months, and pregnant in 24. I don&rsquo;t want to be a Mormon, or any religion; I prefer reason and logic to any religion, and yet I&rsquo;ve had total strangers email me, and tell me to &#8220;be the biggest, best whore I can be&#8221; because that&rsquo;s what men like, and as long as I&rsquo;ll completely denegrate myself, I&rsquo;m sure to find a husband. Even here, in all these posts, there was one that suggested that women need to &#8220;stop writing&#8221; and start making babies. <br/>
I once looked into egg donation; 10-20k is a lot of money, enough to overlook all the needles involved. I discovered that the company wouldn&rsquo;t take me-too tall, and too fat. Fat girls have fat genes, and the women who buy these eggs want athletic children. Despite my high IQ score, GPA, and musical ability, I was missing the one thing that people now want to guarantee for life - thinness. With that rejection, along with all the other rejections I face in social circles, I determined that my most likely opportunity to have children had been eliminated. That&rsquo;s just the way it goes. I&rsquo;m now saving up for lap band surgery in Monterrey (the only place I might be able to afford surgery of any kind) and even if weighed 130 lbs, and had the figure of Brooke Shields (to match my face, which is strikingly similar to her&rsquo;s) I still don&rsquo;t think it would be good enough for the men on this board, because by then my fault would be that I am too old to have children.<br/>
If I can&rsquo;t be loved for who I am, then I guess I&rsquo;ll have to stay alone out of self-respect for not settling for some loser. To all the men out there who blame women for their troubles, go see a psychologist, and talk about your &#8220;Mother issues&#8221;. <br/>

<p>What&rsquo;s your point?  I&rsquo;m a graduate of the University of Maine.  I&rsquo;m also a small business owner and I employ six people in my company.  I work 12 hours a day and pay taxes out the wazooh.  My black neighbor works 9-5 for the government in some useless AA job in an Equal Employment Opportunity Office.  He landed the job by getting a degree from some diploma mill on the internet. He makes roughly the same amount of money I do but I&rsquo;m a more productive and valuable member of society.  Do you support the right of Whites to have freedom of association?  The right to live in their own neighborhoods and hire whomever they dam* well please?  I&rsquo;m guessing probably not.        </p>

			<p>As others have pointed out here, this is not about a shrinking population but rather demographic replacement.<br/>
Look at this quote from the article,</p>
<p>&#8220;Some economists have argued that because the infertility of Europeans is balanced by the high fertility of its immigrants, there will be no noticeable effects from the failure of Caucasians in Europe to produce offspring. If the population as a whole remains stable, the argument goes, economic growth will not be affected..&#8221;</p>
<p>The so called &#8220;demographic winter&#8221; is a concern ONLY to economists, which is to say, Corporations who wish to continue and increase their profit margins.</p>
<p>Europe is, after all, a small continent that currently has a population of around 731 million people.<br/>
As long as you keep the immigrants out, the population of Europe could fall by more than half and there would be no problem. In fact it would be a good thing as, over time, the quality of life would improve 10-fold.</p>

<p>The only people effected by a declining population are the money changers&hellip;..<br/>

			<p>Great post Luke.<br/>
I would add to your list of reasons why White folks are having fewer children than Minorities:</p>
<p>- White folks tend to hold off having children until they feel they can provide for them financially. Minorities either don&rsquo;t think of this, or know &#8220;Big Brother FedGov&#8221; will just cut them a bigger slice of &#8220;FedGov Cheese&#8221; for every kid they have. White folks know FedGov ain&rsquo;t gonna give them so much as a crumb of &#8220;FedGov Cheese&#8221; and most would never even consider it an option.</p>
<p>- Whites think about the money they will have to save for college for the kids.</p>
<p>- Whites worry about the cost of Private k-12 education because they want Junior to actually be able to read his diploma when he gets it.</p>
<p>- Whites don&rsquo;t generally get to live rent/ utilities free in projects or section 8 housing and would be horrified at the idea to begin with. </p>
<p>- Whites generally pay through the nose to provide health insurance for their families. Minorities know they can just pop on down to the &#8220;free&#8221;(for them) clinic or local Emergency Room anytime Junior gets the sniffles and they will never see a bill.</p>
<p>- Because of the Tax Burden imposed (on people who actually work and pay their own way), to pay for all the &#8220;Gimmee&rsquo;s&#8221; FedGov doles out to Minorities, many White households have two working parents which means they also have to shell out for day-care, baby-sitters or a nanny for Junior. </p>
<p>The list goes on &amp; on. </p>
<p>White people don&rsquo;t callously decide to have children or not based solely on financial circumstances, but you have to admit it is a mitigating factor.<br/>
Having children without the benefit of the myriad of &#8220;Gimmee&rsquo;s&#8221; many minorities (even illegal ones) receive from our FedGov is a daunting financial burden. </p>

<p>I agree that abortion is an issue that needs to be adressed but we can&rsquo;t just get rid of it.  My wife and I lost a baby three years ago.  It was going to be born without part of the brain and skull.  Up to that point I was against abortion no matter what but that changed me.  My wife was an emaotional mess.  She could not bare to carry that baby to full term only for it to die the minute it was out of the womb.  So, we need abortion for medical situations but for nothing else.  As for the remainder of your post, I agree 100 percent.</p>

<p>A little bit off the topic, but I&rsquo;m hoping someone would be willing to comment - as far as I could gather from the posts of White South Africans on AmRen - they are not being &#8220;bailed out&#8221; by either White America or Europe in the present times. The sentiment is that of being left on one&rsquo;s own for these people, with America and Europe pretty much not caring about what&rsquo;s happening to them. Would this be a wrong interpretation?</p>

<p>&#8220;The BNP is not racist, but for some reason the media portray them as racist.</p>
<p>We identify ourself with our Anglo- Saxon group and want to keep it; just like other ethnic groups want theirs keeping. But this obsession by the press to call us racists is bewildering.</p>
<p>I would never even consider joining or giving support to such groups who are racists. The idea one group is superior to another is simply not true. All we want is to keep our identity.&#8221;</p>

			<p>In the end, climate may come to our rescue. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine large numbers of brown people living in the the northern USA, Canada, Scandinavia, Russia or Alaska without white subsides. Tho the East Asians might be able to do it, from what I&rsquo;ve seen, they don&rsquo;t much like the cold.</p>
<p>At the very least, pockets of whites should survive in these cold places and may burst forth once again, given the opportunity.</p>
<p>There is really nothing new in this. Nearly all civilizations were founded by whites who were later swamped by darker people. The whites just started over someplace else, usually on the frontier of what is habitable. Space, maybe?</p>
<p>Sure, the feminism and Marxism of that &#8220;certain group&#8221; have been devastating. But we survived their Christianity and the resulting Dark Age, tho it took a thousand years to recover.<br/>

But I work for an insurance company, not in the public sector. <br/>
Secondly the majority of blacks can&rsquo;t afford to buy a property in a white neighberhood! <br/>
As for affirmative action, well, it was white liberal&rsquo;s idea. </p>

Maybe its your attitude that puts men off? Contrary to popular belief us men are not one dimensional and don&rsquo;t only go on beauty and size. However if your one of those women who believe there in competition with men and keep demanding your man does everything then you will stay single! </p>

			<p>Dear Luke,</p>
<p>I think men have to take their share of blame for abortion and demographic decline.  Men usually try to talk women into having abortions because they don&rsquo;t want to grow up and be Fathers.  Did you hear about the guy who slipped an abortion pill in his girlfriend&rsquo;s coffee.</p>

			<p>One of the most significant social engineering efforts in the past few decades has been targeted at white women for the purposes of making them hate their white male counterparts, and discouraging them from reproducing.  Can you think of any society, from any time in history, where the women were taught to despise the males from their own group????  This is so bizarre, yet it exists in the Western world today.  </p>
<p>In addition, white women are being taught to do anything in life except reproduce.  I have worked for a number of large corporations and their ranks are filled with women who will never have any children, or will have only one child at the most.<br/>
What a grim, soulless world this is!!!</p>
<p>The origins of these movements come from the usual suspects; the left, and certain groups who have either a subconscious desire, or have even stated openly, that they would be glad to see the white race eliminated.<br/>

			<p>Feminism, abortion, and liberalism all deserve plenty of blame, but author Lothrop Stoddard predicted our current demographic disaster almost 100 years ago, in his book &#8220;The Revolt Against Civilization.&#8221; As Western societies become more affluent, women have more options outside the home. They increasingly choose those options instead of motherhood.</p>
<p>In addition to the causes that Stoddard identified, feminism teaches women to hate men and to despise their natural role as mothers and homemakers. Western societies&rsquo; narcissistic individualism teaches women to care nothing for the survival of their civilization or of their race. Arabs, Africans, and other barbarians are not afflicted by these niceties, so they naturally out-breed us by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a solution. Perhaps test-tube babies are the only way to preserve our populations without subjecting women to the inconvenience of pregnancy. In any event, I would hate to see my civilization over-run and destroyed by people who do not belong in it and do not understand it.</p>
<p>I normally sign my name to these posts, but I don&rsquo;t want to lose my job.</p>

			<p>To all childless whites: I never appreciated how much my parents did for me until I had children.  Make the effort for others.  To all those despairing of our future: would you rather have lived at any other time?!?  It&rsquo;s all rented folks.  No one gets out of here alive.  Pass the genetic torch on.  We hang wedding day photos of myself and my wife, our parents, grandparents, and great European art and architecture on our walls for our children to see.  Teach them the truth: they are members of the most accomplished race the world has ever seen, with traditions worth carrying on.</p>

			<p>Where Whites are still two-thirds of population we can grumble about things being turned into a sewer, but can go on with enough power to have many things essentially our way in many important fields. But what is not grasped sometimes is that when it gets down to one-third there&rsquo;ll be a revolutionary approach to everything in ways that can&rsquo;t even be imagined now. The 2004 Presidential race wasn&rsquo;t even contested in White minority California. </p>
<p>But what strikes me most ominously is what will be lost in keeping alive White Culture and deflecting anti-White propaganda. What will television, movies, popular magazines and publishable books be like? After all, whatever their political views, the producers of these mediums have to make money and therefore please the majority. It will go deeper than repeating politically correct homilies; the actual existential point of view and story-lines will be non-white. Whites, as such, will only have reference in a marginal way, and given identification by groups that are at best indifferent, and at worst have a historical anger against them.</p>
<p>Whites remain a high percent of the Elite in some places of majority non-white populations, and preserve some element of White culture. But it&rsquo;s an illusion this can continue. Places like South Africa keep some restraints on attacks on rights of Whites because (for economic reasons) they don&rsquo;t want to make white-majority nations(so far) too angry. But what happens when, like I say, the two-thirds become one-third even in the U.S and Europe. People are capable of a great deal of evil when they know they won&rsquo;t have to pay a price for it.</p>
<p>The Constitution won&rsquo;t save us. It can be used, spun or discarded by those that care only about power. We&rsquo;ve already seen that. But aren&rsquo;t there good non-whites that would be appalled by this? Of course, but these people would be swept to the margins in the group dynamics of a darwinian struggle for control. The Constitution is like a religion; you believe in it partly because of the mystic bonds of memory connected with your ancestors and the sacrifices of history. That what gives it resonance. To a come lately outside group it&rsquo;s not particularily interesting.</p>
<p>Would there be enough interest in the Classics of English-language Literature to keep them in print? After all in Capitalism they have to make a profit. A few exceptional non-whites read Shakespeare. A few exceptional Whites read the Chinese Classics; but if the Chinese people would disappear, it&rsquo;s not likely there would be enough interest to keep them in print for very long, except maybe for a few sentimental pastoral poems. A people and what they passionately care about are inseparable. Would non-white voters want to pay the taxes to keep the Library system of the writings of &#8220;dead white men&#8221; alive? The inertia of tradition keeps some White Literature taught in our colleges; but it&rsquo;s clearly water off a ducks back for the vast majority of non-whites, both students and Professors. They&rsquo;re not interested; they have a history that&rsquo;s a world of it&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>There still is a White identity. That&rsquo;s most critically affirmed by the the fact that most Whites still chose to marry other Whites. But when 2/3 become 1/3 will that break down? When under duress, &#8220;racial purity&#8221; become the great sin, when dominant cultural propaganda pressures Whites to marry outside their race to free themselves from this sin, then I think the fat lady has indeed sung.</p>

<p>   Good God, girl, how did you interpret some of the above comments as you did? And why are you so bitter?</p>
<p>   Smart White girls like you are the ones who should be having kids; but that does not mean anyone does not want you to be educated, nor does it mean you have to change your point of view. </p>
<p>   If quality women like you do not have children, Whites die off. Period. Our future is literally in you hands.</p>
<p>   There are plenty of quality White men out there who will treat you well, respect you, and love you. When you find him and have kids, you will find lots of challenge as well as lots of happiness.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.Abortion seems to be an issue that only White Women are obsessed with; I seldom see non-white women spewing such venom and anger over this issue. So, the logical mind would absorb this phenomena - and begin to wonder: Who programmed our women to despise and care so little about the fetuses that white men have fertilized?</p>
<p>Is this part of something that is philosophically deeper than anyone has ever imagined?&#8221; </p>
<p>Posted by Luke at 7:04 PM on February 29 </p>
<p>&gt;   Good question Luke! </p>
<p>     I do think that black women have lots of abortions too, however.  I would like to see some stats on that. </p>
<p>     I recall well in the 1980s the repetitive rhetoric that was worked and worked concerning the notion of the white man as the evil of the world and the need to force them into extinction.  But I do not know how many women really went for that.  In my opinion, it is more a situation of loss of white cultural identity.  AND the problem that many whites, such as many posters here can only recognize Chritianity as the core of white culture when it is really much more than that.  The sad fact - for some here will be that Christianity is neither an exclusively white phenomena, nor even half of what constitutes White Western Culture.  (NO, I am not going to list all the components of Western White Culture here).  I do wish to state that we are our worst enemies when we utilize the Christian model - for many reasons that I will not go into here (although any reader of my long history of posts on Amren will know) as cultural model that allows the white race to succeed - and its replacement with a diverse number of other clearly defined cultures be it Chinese, Japanese (Karate or Kung Foo anyone?), Hispanic and of course, what is called &#8220;African American Culture&#8221; led by people like Ophra Winfrey and Montel Williams advising white Americans (mostly women) how to &#8220;live right,&#8221; on one hand, and Rap &#8220;artists&#8221; Pied Piping the white kids to their own debauching.  </p>
<p>   What we need is quality, not quantity!  The Northwest is full of bratty white kids raised by single parents.  Some may recall the Zero Population Growth movement.  We were supposed to stave off world disaster by voluntarily limiting the reproduction of offspring and do an above average on the ones we had!  All that seems to have gone out the window in the past ten to fifteen years (or more).</p>
<p>The other problem of course is the politics of the Abortion debate.  It is all about power.  If it were not about power, than not only would we wish to end abortion, but we would put into place programs that assisted - in a real way - families to raise the babies that they were forced to have.  We would make the fathers responsible for raising the children they make as well as the women - and not at a distance and by money only.  We would encourage the couples to stay
