						<p>Patriotism should be avoided in school lessons because British history is &#8220;morally ambiguous&#8221;, a leading educational body recommends.</p>
<p>History and citizenship lessons should stick to the bare facts rather than encouraging loyalty to Britain when covering subjects such as the Second World War or the British Empire, the Institute of Education researchers said. Teachers should not instill pride in what they consider great moments of British history, as more shameful episodes could be downplayed or excluded.</p>
<p>The slave trade, imperialism and 20th century wars should be taught as controversial issues while students are deciding how they feel about their country, the report says.</p>
<p>Three quarters of teachers felt obliged to tell students about the danger of patriotism. The survey suggested neither pupils nor teachers wanted patriotism endorsed by schools.</p>
<p>Historians said last night, however, that it was impossible to teach the subject without patriotism or a recognition that British values were rooted in the past.</p>
<p>The report criticises the current drive to use citizenship lessons as a way of promoting pride in being British and developing a sense of belonging. It said: &#8220;To love what is corrupt is itself corrupting, not least because it inclines us to ignore, forget, forgive or excuse the corruption. And there&rsquo;s the rub for patriotism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Countries are morally ambiguous entities: they are what they are by virtue of their histories.&#8221;</p>
<p>The authors added: &#8220;It is hard to think of a national history free from the blights of warmongering, imperialism, tyranny, injustice, slavery and subjugation, or a national identity forged without recourse to exclusionary and xenophobic stereotypes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alan Johnson, the former Education Secretary, announced last year that pupils aged 11 to 16 would have compulsory lessons in British history. Ethnicity, religion, race and national identity will be taught, through studying immigration, the Commonwealth, the Empire and devolution, extending the popular vote and women&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown said at the time: &#8220;There is a golden thread that intertwines the unshakeable British commitment to liberty with another very British idea: that of duty and social responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dr Hand, the co-author of the report, said: &#8220;Gordon Brown and David Cameron have both called for a history curriculum that fosters attachment and loyalty to Britain, but the case for promoting patriotism in schools is weak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are countries really appropriate objects of love? Loving things can be bad for us, for example when the things we love are morally corrupt. Since all national histories are at best morally ambiguous, it&rsquo;s an open question whether citizens should love their countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The institute &mdash; part of the University of London &mdash; asked nearly 300 pupils aged 13 to 14, and 47 teachers, in 20 London schools, how patriotism should be handled. About 94 per cent of teachers and 77 per cent of teenagers said that schools should give a balanced presentation of opposing views. Fewer than 10 per cent felt patriotism should be actively promoted.</p>
<p>However, 19 per cent of teachers and 16 per cent of teenagers thought schools should support patriotic views when expressed by pupils. The historian Tristram Hunt said of the institute&rsquo;s report: &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a very immature approach to the topic. The point is not whether history was right or wrong from a 21st Century liberal-left perspective. It&rsquo;s about teaching students to understand the mindset and context of our forebears.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real problem isn&rsquo;t that our children are being indoctrinated with patriotism, but that they don&rsquo;t know enough British history.&#8221;</p>

			<p>No, don&rsquo;t teach British history or British favoritism to British children.  Teach them about the glories of Wahabi Islam, Sharia law, and OBL.</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot, Islamic terrorism has now been renamed &#8220;anti-Islamic activity&#8221; by official Britain.  Orwell was right, only 24 years behind.</p>

			<p>Are they also going to shy away from the British role in:<br>
Ending African slavery?<br>
Building roads, hospitals etc?<br>
Creating many First-World nations across the globe?</p>
<p>Of course not - white history (that which cannot be claimed by Afrocentrist scholars) is evil:</p>
<p>The sooner you learn that, the better.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite telling that Britain seems to have ended attempting to &#8220;Britishify&#8221; the foreign hordes&hellip;</p>

			<p>This makes me sick, of course you should care about your country!  If you think your country is in bad shape then try to help fix it.  This article sounds like they are trying to make the case for open borders world wide.  Example:  </p>
<p>Patriotism should be avoided in school lessons because British history is &ldquo;morally ambiguous&rdquo;, a leading educational body recommends.</p>
<p>Sounds like they are saying since unsavory things have happened in history we should just ignore all the great things that have happened.  And who are they to decide what is &#8220;Morally Ambiguous&#8221;?  Seems they have not taken into account that in the past somethings we consider wrong by today&rsquo;s standards would be the norm back then.  Example:  Child Labor.  By todays standards we find it wrong to have children working in mines and such.  But back in the day that was a common thing and not thought to be wrong.  So how can you fairly judge the morals of the past by using the standards of today?</p>

<p>Or they can be labeled as &#8220;what intelligent and veral nations do to weak and lowly nations.&#8221;  Toss in a bit of realism and voila! Such wonderful history. Though I have to say that, ultimately, I cannot abide by &#8220;the white man&rsquo;s burden.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t help but notice that an important part of the &#8216;moral ambiguity&rsquo; of British history, was its role in the slave trade. I must admit I find it one of the great unanswered mysteries as to why the West ever started this institution. I know that the practice of making prisoners of war into slaves predated the triangular trade in Africa. I also know that a very common fate of such slaves was to be eaten. Could saving Africans from cannibalism have player a significant role in the genesis of the tringular trade? </p>

<p>Do they think they are somehow immune from the bloodletting for facilitating the takeover of the country by foreigners?</p>
<p>Will the royal family continue under an islamic state?</p>

			<p>If you are not to love your country, then why are there laws against treason on the books?</p>
<p>It seems I recall of a pro-Nazi Briton, William Joyce, who broadcast Nazi propaganda under the name Lord Haw- Haw, during World War II. He was executed for treason. Are his activities now to be lauded in the New Britain, because he didn&rsquo;t love his country? If so, then why TF did we go to England&rsquo;s aid in two world wars? For this garbage?!  </p>

			<p>I think what&rsquo;s really important here is that the people of Britain chose their current government and the so- called &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; that comes with it.</p>
<p>None of this insanity would be possible if the common citizen voted against it as well as the leaders who support it.  This is what the free people of Britain asked for and they got it.</p>
<p>Patriotism, one of the true binding agents of a county, is now considered wrong and will be banned, but this is what &#8220;the people&#8221; want in Britain.  <br>

			<p>I love the way the establishment is getting itself catastrophically entangled in its endeavours to forge stability from the inherently unstable situation their diabolical ideology has created.  Gordon Brown thought US-style patriotism would hold us all together, no doubt because that&rsquo;s how it appears in the movies, now the educationalists defer.  Can anyone see history repeating itself?  Inter-war Germany?  Loss of dignity and pride in themselves?  Along comes a man with a remedy?</p>

			<p>This is sad that you can&rsquo;t take pride in your country and your history. Great Britain is no more, they have lost their pride and direction. There is no more national destiny and will of the British people. I don&rsquo;t respect the British anymore. </p>

And what of the governmental ministry of Education itself?<br>
Isn&rsquo;t it likewise morally ambiguous? Why listen to any of its<br>

<p>I believe that the BBC in England is the main broadcaster of news and opinion, allowing it to shape public debate and policy undemocratically. In fact I don&rsquo;t think the BBC is even funded by advertisers who can boycott bad programming but is instead funded by taxes. I know that in Germany most of the main broadcasters are state-owned and therefore public debate is probably limited to what they want to discuss. </p>

<p>If I were to believe such a theory, I would think it just as likely the elite&rsquo;s true goal is in manipulating our DNA itself. They want us all to nearly, or very nearly, share the same DNA code, ending &#8216;racism&rsquo; itself&hellip; but, I don&rsquo;t really believe that explanation either.  </p>

SopranoFan<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
Actually, William Joyce (a member of the same family of the great Irish writer,James Joyce) was an American citizen, being Brooklyn-born, of Irish descent whose family returned there (to Galway). He later joined the Black and Tans and supported the United British cause in Ireland, because his family opposed the split-up of the British Isles, correctly seeing that as the beginning of the end  for all of them.  He lived in Britain for a time.  He went to Germany in 1940 and became a naturalized German citizen.  He loyally supported his country (Germany) in the war effort.</p>
<p>There was a lot of controversy about the legality of Britain hanging someone for &#8220;treason&#8221; committed against a country to which he owed no loyalty. Now, with the war hysteria long behind us, it&rsquo;s generally agreed that they were wrong to have done so.</p>
<p>You say he didn&rsquo;t love his country?  Not only was it not his country (having changed his citizenship from American to German), but his last words before the British hanged him were:<br>
 <br>
  <i>&#8220;May Britain be great once again. And in the hour of the greatest danger in the West, may the standard be raised from the dust, crowned with the words, &#8216;You have conquered nevertheless.&rsquo;  I am proud to die for my ideals, and <b>I am sorry for the sons of Britain who have died without knowing why.&rdquo; </b></i></p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound like &#8220;hating&#8221; Britain to me!<br>

&#8220;The authors added: &ldquo;It is hard to think of a national history free from the blights of warmongering, imperialism, tyranny, injustice, slavery and subjugation, or a national identity forged without recourse to exclusionary and xenophobic stereotypes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Well if NO national history is free from these &#8220;blights&#8221;   &mdash;   if the problem is universal   &mdash;   then these blights must be unavoidable aspects of HUMAN NATURE!</p>
<p>And only delusional transnational Socialist crackpots like this guy think human nature can be reprogrammed like resetting the time on a digital watch. Teaching self-hatred to your nation&rsquo;s children is a massively stupid idea   &mdash;   with massively destructive consequences. </p>
<p>The idea is so stupid, in fact, that only white leftists could come up with it. <br>

			<p>&#8220;I just wonder what all the traitor politicians and their families are going to do when the foreigners take over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take a look at South Africa, where the white liberals are living in their usual denial, supporting the ANC and, in the words of Churchill on the subject of appeasers, &#8220;Feeding a crocodile in the hope it will eat them last&#8221; (southafricasuck.blogspot.com - it&rsquo;s a bit racist but the news is legit.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what&rsquo;s really important here is that the people of Britain chose their current government and the so- called &ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo; that comes with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, less than 30% of the entire electorate voted for Blair - nobody voted for Brown.  The three parties here all have the same policies so who to vote for?  The British National Party?  We have no proportional representation, so the nationalists can&rsquo;t achieve the power and respect they do on the Continent.  Vilified by politicians, the MSM, satirists and &#8216;thinkers&rsquo;, they lack respected members.  Sensible people are too scared to join.  Members cannot join the police force, prison service etc.  The BNP is a toothless dog, a condition which has emboldened some to call for violence against them.  The British satirist, Jeremy Hardy has said they should be &#8216;shot in the back of the head&rsquo; (see BBC online Tuesday, 2 November, 2004) and songwriter-activist, Billy Bragg, who lives in all-white Devon, that they should be &#8216;duffed up on the street&rsquo;.  And the call to violence has been heeded.  A BNP member was knifed to death by Asians last year.  Also last year police discovered a bomb plot against the BNP which the MSM have, of course, not followed up.  </p>
<p>The uneducated morons in parliament now don&rsquo;t have the acumen to realise the significance of ideological killings coming to a land where such acts have never been a part of the political landscape.  Those politicians who do condemn immigration lose their posts, which is why some wait until the day they retire.  </p>
<p>At present Britain is run by liberal fascists, but the pendulum always swings.  First we must win the information war, and don&rsquo;t doubt that we are doing that now.  The number of websites favourable to the cause grows by the day.</p>

			<p>Now the Brits can establish national heros from their ranks of social engineers that have, and currently are, making England a nation of pathetic sheep. </p>
<p>I can see the headlines now; &#8220;Sir Blather is being enshrined today with a statue in Picadilly Square, due to his noble success in establishing the modern welfare state.  His two mottos were; &#8216;stay a child, shut up, obey, get drunk, and love your local mugger&rsquo;, and &#8216;I&rsquo;ll give you free stuff paid for by someone who actually works&rsquo;.&#8221; </p>
<p>The British voters asked for it, and now they got it.  They have no one to blame but themselves.   </p>

			<p>To ghw:</p>
<p>Thanks for providing a little more background about William Joyce. Admittedly, I came across the mention of Joyce&rsquo;s execution in one of those paperback almanacs a few years ago (before the explosion of the Internet), under a WWII &#8220;capsule of events&#8221;.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know Joyce was American-born. In the past, Britain would never have executed an American-born citizen; but in Joyce&rsquo;s case, he became a citizen of Nazi Germany. That made it easy for the Brits (with Roosevelt&rsquo;s silent acquiescence, no doubt).</p>
<p>Contrast that with Eamonn de Valera (born in NYC). The only reason the Brits didn&rsquo;t hang him after the 1916 Easter Rebellion, was because he was born in America, and Churchill (who was in the Naval Dept., I believe) needed America to get into WWI. He knew the Irish-American dockworkers hated Britain, even as they were loading the American ships carrying aid to England,and didn&rsquo;t want to risk their wrath.  </p>

			<p>&ldquo;Are countries really appropriate objects of love? Loving things can be bad for us, for example when the things we love are morally corrupt. Since all national histories are at best morally ambiguous, it&rsquo;s an open question whether citizens should love their countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its over for Britain.</p>

			<p>Ronduck brought up a very important point in his posting.</p>
<p>The Democrats recently tried to pass a law reducing the number of conservative radio stations while publicly financing liberal ones.  It failed to pass   &mdash;   this time.  I guess this is how government control of the airwaves starts, little by little.</p>
<p>You think liberals would be satisfied with their near complete control of the main stream media.   </p>
<p>It might be accurate to say that the number of free thinking Americans is also decreasing with tens of millions voting for socialists who promise to parent them from cradle to grave. Oh the surprise in store for those sheeple!  I hope I&rsquo;ve gone to my &#8220;final reward&#8221; by then.  </p>

			<p>So they don&rsquo;t want to teach the youngsters that Britain stopped the slave trade and suppressed piracy, brought civilization to the the third world (The only thing Britain did wrong was to leave before the job was finished.), and won the Battle of Britain and stood along against Hitler for more than a year.<br>
   What are they teaching childrem nowadays? </p>

			<p>Well, now that &#8220;Britain&#8221; is to be despised, and those who would advocate otherwise are ostracized from productive lives, imprisoned, and targeted for violence (with impunity from those incredible laws governing speech, it seems) &hellip;</p>
<p>Is it not time to think of a new name for the place?  I suppose that will be a task for the new masters of the isles, along with &#8220;defending&#8221; the pride and honor of that mastery by attacking whoever makes the mistake of using the old, hateful name for the place.</p>
<p>Looks like the sad tale of my hometown (Detroit) writ large. I remember seeing a headline years ago on the front page of the news (the Detroit News or the Free Press; I don&rsquo;t recall which one it was now- they each competed to be the main paper of the city-  this was no one-man, basement printing of an ignored fringe):  <br>
  &#8220;A Blacker Detroit is a source of Pride&#8221; .</p>
<p>What do whites do when the anti-whites bring things to a &#8220;tipping point&#8221;?  Apparently, we just fall down.   </p>
<p>Well, letting anti-whites of all kinds tie us down first rather prevents doing anything besides tasting the treatment received at the hands of any &amp; all who hate us when they are in a position to do as they please.  </p>
<p>Scarcely a generation after Britain&rsquo;s &#8220;finest hour&#8221;, she has prostrated herself before those bent on her destruction. </p>
<p>I am disappointed, sad- and disgusted.  </p>

			<p>Yet one more reason to homeschool.</p>
<p>We (in our home) are using a marvelous book, called &#8220;An Island Story&#8221; by H.E. Marshall, about where America&rsquo;s citizens come from- those vast numbers of English, Scots-Irish and the like that created the USA.</p>
<p>The book is decidedly PRO-England, and ennobling and fascinating to my children.</p>
<p>We just read a beautiful story about King Alfred the Great. (ca. 875 A.D.) Each chapter makes me proud to know these are our ancestors, our flesh and bone kith and kin, and we are grateful to stand upon their shoulders.</p>
<p>I can see why the Bolsheviks in Britain want to destroy this heritage. Didn&rsquo;t Lenin say that in order for Marxism to succeed, one had to destroy one&rsquo;s pride in one&rsquo;s heritage?</p>
<p>Homeschooling&hellip;the ultimate revolutionary activity.</p>

<p>What do whites do? What did they do in the Caribbean, in places like Jamaica, Virgin Islands, Haiti, Tobago, or in Africa? That would make in interesting American Renaissance article. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The slave trade, imperialism and 20th century wars should be taught as controversial issues while students are deciding how they feel about their country, the report says.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guarantee the British schools will not demonize the non-Western nations and peoples for having engaged in similar activities.  However, anti-Western communist propaganda has now become so pervasive it is so transparent that even the blind can see right through it.  If you give the communist&rsquo;s enough rope they too will hang themselves with it, even rope they bought from capitalists&hellip;     </p>

			<p>&#8220;Gordon Brown thought US-style patriotism would hold us all together, no doubt because that&rsquo;s how it appears in the movies, now the educationalists defer&#8221;</p>
<p>It may appear that way in the movies but the truth is that here in american schools, marxists have had a big foothold for years. In texas, where I&rsquo;m from, white kids are taught that whites are the cause of all evil in history.</p>
