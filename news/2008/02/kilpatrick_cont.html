<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Sorry is as sorry does. Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick gave what seemed to be a heart-felt apology Wednesday night for allowing his personal behavior to embarrass his family and city. Apologies carry more weight when they&rsquo;re followed by a change of action. Since speaking to the city, Kilpatrick has stood by while City Hall security guards manhandled a WDIV-Channel 4 reporter. Just before the speech, the mayor shoved a WXYZ-TV Channel 7 reporter in the chest and smacked a female Detroit Free Press photographer in the face. The physical assaults invite more costly legal trouble for both the mayor and the city &mdash; as does the move to limit public access to the publicly owned Coleman A. Young municipal building. The day after the mayor&rsquo;s televised apology, an edict was newly enforced to restrict the movements of reporters at City Hall. If continued, this, too, will bring the city unnecessary lawsuits, although by Friday security officials were loosening the restrictions. Kilpatrick seems to be a lot better at saying he&rsquo;s sorry than he is at changing the behavior that makes the apologies necessary. Perhaps that&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s had a lot more practice at the former than he has the latter.</p>

					<p>Coleman Young&rsquo;s long administration is the reason for a great deal of the poor state of race relations in the Detroit area. But, at least His Honor had some class and was easy to understand - he wanted to &#8220;bring home the bacon&#8221; to his black constituents. This makes sense to me and explains his long reign.</p>
<p>This Kilpatrick character has accomplished nothing and destroyed much of what little is left in Detroit. He is the worst of what the ghetto culture produces and, as a former Wayne County resident, I wish Detroit would vote its interests and not its racial politics.</p>

					<p>This mayor is not worried about fines.  The money for the fines will come from the taxpay and once paid go right back into the city treasury.  When will anyone get smart in Detroit.</p>

					<p>What&rsquo;s interesting in the case of &#8220;America&rsquo;s First Hip Hop Mayor&#8221; is the lib <span class="caps">MSM </span>in Dirt-rot, Michigan are universally coming out against him.  But what gets me is why they define his behavior as &#8220;bad&#8221;    &mdash;    it&rsquo;s normal black behavior, and in the spirit of diversity and equality this same <span class="caps">MSM </span>forces on us, they should overlook his &#8220;transgressions&#8221; and chalk it up to 500 years of slavery and Jim Crow.</p>

					<p>Not surprised. He is behaving exactly like other African rulers except we still have white people here overseeing things. Blacks are just so amazing but not in a good way. They don&rsquo;t care if a black person is a good worker, administrator, mayor, or anything. They only want someone black who&rsquo;ll take care of them and isn&rsquo;t this how tribal politics is ruining Africa?</p>

					<p>Kwame can look good and speak confidently which I guess is all that matters.  He should lose his law license and be on his way to prison now but there is no way that the blacks in Detroit are going allow that to happen.  He moves around with that ridiculous Mike Tyson like entourage of bodyguards when he himself must be 6&rsquo;6&rsquo; and 350 pounds.  A normal human could not put a dent in him and who is going to mess with him anyway?  <br/>
Slapping around reporters probably is not his smartest move but who said anything about him being smart.</p>
<p>People repeatedly comment on what a basket case Detroit is and there is no doubt that it is just that.  For the first time in a number of years, I have been back in Detroit quite a lot these past five months.  One of the first things I noticed was a gushing water main leak pouring out into Warren Avenue a short distance from the intersection with Woodward Avenue, which is the main street for Detroit.  This is an important intersection in the city and is just one block south of the Detroit Institute of Arts.  I would estimate the volume of water escaping from this leak to be on the order of 50 gallons per minute if not more.  When I returned to the city one week later, to my mild surprise the leak was still gushing in the same manner as before.  And one week after that, it was still going strong.  In fact, this big water leak was allowed to continue throughout the entire month of September!  The folks in the suburbs get to pay for that terrible sloppiness of course as they buy their water from the city of Detroit.  This slovenliness and total lack of attention to detail on the part of the city government seems to characterize the situation under Mayor Kwame quite well.  Things did get better for a while when Dennis Archer was mayor but it is sinking back to the jungle again.    </p>

					<p>Look at any major city and you can see those cities rotting from the inner-city out. In Kansas City, the KC Star publishes an on line crime map. You can see that the inner-city is the focus of the majority of the crime. As you get further from that point, the crime diminishes. Look to Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and S. Africa as the model of what minority controlled areas will look like in America. Here in KC we have a minority controlled city council and school board. And as miniorities they can&rsquo;t agree on one issue so nothing of consequence gets accomplished. However they can agree that they will do everything to twart our white mayor and totally destroy our school system.</p>

<p>Yes, it <span class="caps">WAS </span>once a great city, but today Blacks think of it as their own, and have almost developed a form a amensia about the fact that Whites were there first. Detroit has such an awful reputation these days that they get a little defensive about it, and will talk about it wonderful architecture. That wonderous architecture was thanks to Whites, though they can take credit for burning them and letting crumble.<br/>

					<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;blacks destroying our cities, attacking our people, wanting to be only around their own kind and culture. They sure don&rsquo;t act like they want to be a part of a white civilization. Well, if that is so, then why don&rsquo;t they just go back to their continent of origin, Africa? Nobody is stopping them,they are not slaves. They are free to travel. They are favored in employment and school admissions. If they hate being here and us so much, then why don&rsquo;t they save their money, get an education and then leave, and go back to Africa and build a better Africa?  </p>
