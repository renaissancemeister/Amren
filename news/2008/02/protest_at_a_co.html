<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Inside the Crowne Plaza Dulles Airport Hotel in Herndon were more than 100 attendees, most of them white men, of the American Renaissance Conference. Among the seminars were &#8220;Understanding the African Mind&#8221; and &#8220;Mexico From the Inside: Who the Mexicans Are and Why They Do What They Do.&#8221; For sale outside conference rooms were neckties decorated with Confederate emblems and books such as &#8220;Race Differences in Intelligence&#8221; and &#8220;Zoological Subspecies of Man.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the sidewalk outside &mdash; just off the Dulles Toll Road &mdash; stood a young, racially mixed group of three dozen protesters with megaphones and drums. They carried posters decrying Nazism, racism and fascism as they tried in vain to pass a police phalanx and enter the hotel to disrupt the conference.</p>
<p>Police firmly but gently pushed the protesters off hotel property and into an area marked with orange cones and yellow tape in a lane of the street in front of the hotel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The conference was sponsored by the New Century Foundation, which was launched by Jared Taylor, who calls himself a &#8220;race realist.&#8221; Taylor spoke with a reporter about the conference in the hotel. Taylor, who lives in the Oakton section of Fairfax County, has been described by civil rights organizations as a &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; who espouses racism.</p>
<p>Taylor said a theme of the conference was the intersection of immigration and race, which he said is reflected in the presidential campaign. &#8220;The country is catching up with us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Taylor decried the attempt to disrupt the conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they call us Nazis?&#8221; he said.</p>
