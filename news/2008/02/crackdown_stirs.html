						<p>To Santa Rosa County Sheriff Wendell Hall, the issue is simple: Uphold the law.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Hall&rsquo;s department has been cracking down on undocumented workers, checking businesses to determine if employees are using fraudulent documentation, such as stolen Social Security numbers.</p>
<p>So far, the so-called Area Improvement Management team has checked 22 businesses and arrested 27 people &mdash; all of them Hispanic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we don&rsquo;t have to put any more in jail,&#8221; Hall said. &#8220;Hopefully, they&rsquo;re going to realize they&rsquo;re going to have to do it the right way or they&rsquo;re going to have to move out of Santa Rosa County.&#8221;</p>
<p>The raids have created a firestorm, with opponents accusing the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office of racism, racial profiling and essentially terrorizing Spanish-speaking immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The arrests have provoked outrage among some community residents, prompting a small public protest earlier this month at the Santa Rosa County Courthouse and numerous letters to the editor in the News Journal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think arresting just the Hispanics is discrimination,&#8221; said O&rsquo;Brien, who participated in the demonstration. &#8220;Is it the jurisdiction of the sheriff to do immigration work? Let Homeland Security take care of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Hall firmly believes he is serving county residents by arresting people who are breaking the law, no matter their race or ethnicity. He said federal authorities who enforce immigration laws have been unresponsive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hall said the flood of undocumented workers began after Hurricane Ivan in 2004.</p>
<p>Northwest Florida law enforcement agencies began discovering people using false documents stolen from U.S. citizens to obtain employment. They included not only people who were in the United States illegally but also U.S. citizens who were trying to avoid arrest on criminal warrants, Hall said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hall acknowledged that the arrests are further burdening the already overcrowded county jail. The jail has an official capacity of 500, but housed 569 inmates Friday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 27 workers arrested so far are charged with using false documents &mdash; Social Security numbers &mdash; to obtain employment, a third-degree felony. They remain in the Santa Rosa County Jail on holds from the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The Public Defender&rsquo;s Office is to represent all the suspects, scheduled for arraignment on March 5.</p>
<p>If Immigration and Customs Enforcement decides to intervene, the undocumented workers could all face deportation.</p>
<p><b>Tip line for complaints</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Office has a tip line &mdash; 983-1198 &mdash; for citizens to report suspected undocumented workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There was a time, Smith pointed out [Chief Deputy Larry Smith of the Escambia County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office], that citizens of Northwest Florida were happy to see Hispanics, regardless of their status.</p>
<p>&#8220;After (hurricanes) Ivan and Dennis, we were quite proud to have the Hispanic population come to this county. There were houses to be rebuilt and roofs to be fixed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We were glad to see them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Undocumented workers may continue to be arrested in Santa Rosa County, regardless of whether Hall is re-elected this fall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shane King, who owns a landscaping business in Milton, said Hall is simply doing his job.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we elect someone sheriff, if they don&rsquo;t do their job, we&rsquo;re going to be upset with them,&#8221; King said. &#8220;The sheriff&rsquo;s duty is to arrest or detain all law violators, period.&#8221;<br>

			<p>It is great to see that at least some of America has finally had enough of this invasion, and just aren&rsquo;t afraid of the empty accusations of &#8220;racism,&#8221; &#8220;profiling&#8221; and all that similar nonsense any longer. And it does appear that some of the inavaders and their loud-mouthed supporters are getting nervous. But I am very cautious about getting too excited&hellip;<br>
There is a very real possibility of not only a Democrat being elected President next year, but an unapologetically liberal half-black one at that! While Bush has been utterly useless on this(and most any other)issue and McCain would be no better, one can only imagine what an Obama Presidency would do to set-back even these small gains in turning the tide of the (largely)illegal Hispanicization of America.  <br>

<p>The Fact is a three bedroom house was found to have 69 illegal aliens liveing in it on long Island a few years ago.So over crowding our Jails with Mexicans will just make them feel at home.</p>

			<p>Criminals always complain when their enterprises get busted. Pay them no mind, the whining of illegal aliens and their network of criminal employers carries no clout. Just noise. Lock &#8216;em all up and deport whatever&rsquo;s left over.</p>
<p>Town by town, county by county, state by state, that&rsquo;s how you get the job done. One criminal at a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After (hurricanes) Ivan and Dennis, we were quite proud to have the Hispanic population come to this county. There were houses to be rebuilt and roofs to be fixed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We were glad to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling real glad now, I imagine. After they built the houses and fixed the roofs, they stuck around to drain the social services, kill a few locals, fill the jails, bankrupt the medical and educational system while dropping a few zillion anchors for the US Citizens to take care of for generations to come. Thanks a lot. Greed carries a huge price tag. Now law enforcement must act as the nations janitor, cleaning up the politicians messes. </p>
<p>THANK YOU, Sheriff Hall! </p>

			<p>OK, the sheriff doesn&rsquo;t want ILLEGAL aliens sponging off the TAX PAYING CITIZENS&hellip;so what&rsquo;s the problem?!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, the pro-illegals always use words like &#8220;terrorizing&#8221; or &#8220;tramatizing&#8221; the hispanics when law enforcement ENFORCES the US laws.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the illegal aliens who are &#8220;terrorizing&#8221; and &#8220;tramatizing&#8221; us with their rapes, robberies, murders, drunk driving, disease, poverty, illiteracy and the rest of their third world customs they bring here because the fled the hellhole where millions of their race live.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is why they wanted to come here way back when the country was 90% white.  Why be surrounded by and subject your children to all the evil, wicked white racists? </p>

			<p>Kudos to sheriff Hall for doing the right thing and enforcing our laws (doing the job the federal government won&rsquo;t do). Now if this could be done in every county in every state, then maybe the lawbreakers will get the message and go home.</p>

			<p>And the LOUDEST PROTESTORS (after Hispanics and the activist groups) are the greedy business owners, slavering for cheap labor! But since Mr. Fatwallet can afford to live in his upscale, gated, well guarded enclave, why should he care if the rest of America has to endure the crime, the social problems associated with immigration.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;ll never hear Mr. fatwallet admit anything like this. He&rsquo;ll spout his platitudes &#8220;let Homeland security worry about the illegals.&#8221; Or try this one: &#8220;We need to be compassionate. These are just honest people coming to better themselves!&#8221; Neglecting to add, of course; At the expense of American taxpayers and citizens.</p>

<p>Well, Charlie, when they totally overwhelm an area with crime and poverty they&rsquo;ve pushed the issue a bit too far, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?  Or do you not care about that either just so long as you can have your yard mowed for five bucks?</p>
<p>You ought to be ran out of office and arrested for malfeasance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody who doesn&rsquo;t speak English is afraid to walk down the street,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Whether they have documents or not, they&rsquo;re afraid they&rsquo;re going to get harassed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, we&rsquo;re just positive they&rsquo;re afraid to walk down the street.  That&rsquo;s why they stand on street corners in large packs trying to harass someone into picking them up, and that&rsquo;s why the&rsquo;re afraid to participate in open demonstrations.</p>
<p>Get off the &#8220;they&rsquo;re afraid&#8221; bull.  These retards aren&rsquo;t bright enough to be afraid.</p>
<p>Walking the streets carrying signs that say, &#8220;This land is our land. Go back to Europe,&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t sound as if they&rsquo;re afraid to walk the streets.</p>
<p>Absolutely absurd.</p>

<p>They are not arresting people because they are Hispanic. They are arresting people who are here illegally. Another manipulative play on people&rsquo;s emotions. It is the jurisdiction of the sherriff to arrest lawbreakers in his county. If Homeland Security had been doing their jobs, the border would have been closed already.</p>
<p>&#8220;The raids have created a firestorm, with opponents accusing the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office of racism, racial profiling and essentially terrorizing Spanish-speaking immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Spanish-speaking immigrants are here legally, they have nothing to worry about,right? Since just about all of the illegals in the county are Hispanic, it&rsquo;s just common sense, not profiling,  that that is the group you look at.</p>

			<p>Interesting. Hispanics &#8216;americans&rsquo; crying racism because illegal aliens, all hispanic, all breaking the law, are being introduced to the realities of their lawbreaking. Do these &#8216;american hispanics&rsquo; consider themselves true U.S. citizens, or just hispanic. If they were true U.S. citizens they would applaud and support those trying to uphold the law, but this is not the case, as it very rarely is. These people will never assimilate and never care for the laws and customs of this country. &#8216;Hispanic americans&rsquo; often seem to consider race before the rule of law and their citizenly duties. We let them in the country and the first thing they do is protest against the white establishment and demand preferential treatment. This type of mindset must be ended.</p>

<p>Exactly how does Mr.Smith know this? Did he ask the residents if they were happy? No, he didn&rsquo;t so how does he know? He doesn&rsquo;t, he is just spouting more propaganda. The truth is that there were plenty of Americans  needed to help rebuild however once again, greedy white americans hired illegals instead of their fellow countrymen. I place the most blame on the American employers and secondly on the Mexicans and their government.<br>

			<p>Bush started all this and why he is the worst most screwed up prez in world history. <br>
Before 2000 the mexican problem was mostly in Cal and Tx and other border states only. <br>
Bush signaled the entrance flood of as many as 20 million or more Spanish speaking Mongoloids from below the border and sat back doing nothing for 6 yrs before he was forced in 2006 to pretend to take a harder line when in fact it was a fake like everything else this silver spoon knucklehead idiot has done since day one. <br>
Bush has therefore destroyed not only Americas control by the white race but he has destroyed the reputation of the south as a poser posing with his fake Texan accent he changes depending on the situation and has destroyed the GOP party as the Hussein guy prepares to take over as an ex-Muslim although we know Muslims are Muslims for life. </p>

If not, you are suspect.  It has nothing to do with race.  Too bad we all can&rsquo;t use the tip line to call the sheriff.  Seems he is one man who understands his job.</p>

Oh please, letting Homeland security take care of this problem isn&rsquo;t working and the illegal invader enablers know this. And when the feds finally do do something these same enablers whine about that. They don&rsquo;t want any US government agencys enforcing our immigration laws, it&rsquo;s that simple with these people. But, I hope the sheriff gets things right because Pensacola is where I was planning to retire and I certainly don&rsquo;t want to move to a place that resembles the place I live in now, Las Vegas NV. I&rsquo;m glad to see they have some people there like this cop who take the immigration laws of this country seriously.</p>

			<p>Re: Those wonderful workers who repaired houses after hurricane Ivan.</p>
<p>My ex-husband is an American construction worker.  His union actually still exists and wages are good.  I guess the developers of billion dollar NYC high rise office buildings prefer trained, competent structural iron workers instead of Pedro the idiot.</p>
<p>He had a job in Egypt. When the job was done his visa expired and he went home instead of hanging around draining whatever social services they have in Egypt, taking jobs from Egyptians and trying to take over the country.</p>
<p>BTW, when he signed the contract they told him &#8220;no alcohol, no women, it&rsquo;s a muslim country&#8221;  He bit the bullet and did without women and alchohol for 2 years, thus conforming to the society that offered him such good pay.</p>
