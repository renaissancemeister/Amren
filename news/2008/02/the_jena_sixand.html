<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p> &#8220;(S)ome Americans do not understand why the sight of a noose causes such a visceral reaction,&#8221; declared President Bush to the White House gathering for Black History Month.</p>
<p> As The Washington Post rushed to remind us, President Bush was &#8220;responding to news coverage of such episodes as the &lsquo;Jena Six.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p> But if history is about truth, not myth, that news coverage deserves another look, before the Jena Six enter the history books alongside Emmett Till and &#8220;the Scottsboro Boys.&#8221;</p>
<p> By now, most folks know the media story. White students at Jena High in Louisiana hung nooses on a tree to warn black students not to sit under it. After a fistfight over this racist outrage, black kids in the fight were indicted for attempted murder, while the white racists who hung the nooses walked away with a verbal spanking.</p>
<p> Last September, 20,000 traveled to Jena to march against this prosecutorial outrage. Fortunately, however, there are still a few real journalists around. Among them are Craig Franklin, assistant editor of the Jena Times, whose wife teaches at Jena High, and Charlotte Allen, who wrote an extended piece for The Weekly Standard. According to Allen and Franklin, here are the facts and chronology you have been denied by the Mainstream Media.</p>
<p> There never was a &#8220;whites-only&#8221; tree at Jena High. Both races sat under it, though whites congregated there. The nooses, or lariats, were the work of three young teens, who got the idea from watching &#8220;Lonesome Dove&#8221; on TV, where rustlers are hanged.</p>
<p> Franklin says they were a joke aimed at white friends on the rodeo team. As they were painted in Jena High&rsquo;s gold and black, Allen reports that the kids said the nooses were directed at a rival school&rsquo;s Western-themed football team.</p>
<p> When school officials confronted them, all were remorseful. All had black friends, and none knew the nooses were offensive to blacks.</p>
<p> Far from being let off, they spent &#8220;nine days at an alternative facility, followed by two weeks of in-school suspension, Saturday detentions, attendance at Discipline Court and evaluations by licensed mental-health professionals.&#8221;</p>
<p> They were not prosecuted for a hate crime because none of those who investigated the incident believed they committed a hate crime. Hung on Aug. 31, 2006, the nooses had been taken down instantly. Only a few students ever saw them. Case closed.</p>
<p> September, October and November passed at Jena High with no racial conflict emanating from the noose incident of August.</p>
<p> On Dec. 1, however, Robert Bailey Jr. tried to crash a party at the Fair Barn in Jena. One Justin Sloan, 22, not a student, put a fist in his face. So witnesses and Bailey reported to police. And Sloan was prosecuted for battery.</p>
<p> On Dec. 2, Bailey and two friends jumped a white male entering the &#8220;Gotta Go&#8221; grocery. When the latter ran to get a shotgun out of his car, they wrested it from him and took it. So two witnesses at the &#8220;Gotta Go&#8221; agreed.</p>
<p> Two days later came the &#8220;schoolyard fight.&#8221; Only this was no fight. Black students barricaded an exit to the gym and lay in wait for Justin Barker. As Barker went for another exit, he was struck in the head from behind by Mychal Bell. Multiple witnesses say Barker fell unconscious as a gang of eight or 10 blacks stomped and kicked him in the head. The assistant principal who reached Barker thought he was dead. Barker&rsquo;s emergency room bill ran to more than $5,000.</p>
<p> When the six were arrested and charged with attempted second-degree murder, none of them and none of the witnesses mentioned the noose incident. It had had nothing to do with this vicious racist assault.</p>
<p> After the charges were reduced to battery, Bell, tried as an adult, was indeed convicted by an all-white jury &mdash; because no blacks answered the summons to the jury pool. Why was Bell prosecuted as an adult? Because he had four prior convictions for crimes of violence.</p>
<p> After his conviction was overturned, Bell was ordered retried as a juvenile. Rather than face the same 17 witnesses, he pled guilty in December to hitting Barker from behind, slamming his head into a concrete beam and kicking him in the head. Sentenced to 18 months in juvenile detention, he agreed to testify against his co-conspirators.</p>
<p> While some $500,000 has been raised for the Jena Six defense, its whereabouts is unknown. Bailey did pose on the Internet grinning, however, with $100 bills in his mouth. Bell&rsquo;s mom is said to be driving a new Jaguar, and Bailey&rsquo;s mom a new Beamer. Two other Jena Sixers, Carwin Jones and Bryant Purvis, appeared in rapper attire on Black Entertainment Television as presenters of a Hip-Hop Award.</p>
<p> A week ago, 6-foot, 6-inch Purvis, who had transferred to Hebron High in Carrollton, Texas, was charged with assault, choking a student and ramming his head into a bench.</p>
<p> And that&rsquo;s the Saga of The Jena Six. It belongs right up there with the Rev. Al&rsquo;s other classics: Tawana Brawley and the Duke rape case.<br>

			<p>&#8220;appeared in rapper attire&#8221; I saw something out of the ordinary the other day. No, it was astounding!  I was watching the TV guide channel at the Grammys  and they were interviewing a rapper. He had all the mandatory cred. Silly over sized brim hat, gold chains etc. <br>
 Next up walks some girl named Fergie. No, not the royalty. She was up for an award also. Well she walks up on camera and air kisses the foppish White  male announcer. And she totally IGNORES the rapper right beside her. I`m talking cheerleader blowing off band geek here folks. And I went, &#8220;Oh my God! Did she not get the script, or is she blowing it off completely?!?&#8221; It was almost a revolutionary declaration of White solidarity and kinship. For a moment or two, the rapper started clowning in front of her, lifting his sunglasses and looking at her all bug eyed, trying to get a response. She was as cool as a weatherman ignoring  some shouting  teenage kids crowding into his space. Finally the rapper ambles off, with not a word or glint of acknowledgement from her or the announcer. I smelled the whiff of  cultural change all the way across the room. It was intoxicating!!  </p>

			<p>One of the chinks in the armor of the phenomenon known as Patrick J. Buchanan is that he thinks the civil rights movement of the 1960s, and the &ldquo;liberation&rdquo; of American blacks it portends, is somehow a good thing.  It looks like he might be fortifying that foible just a little bit with this column about the Jena Six Thugs.</p>
<p>However, he still has some work to do, because he admonishes his readers not to equate the Jena Six Thugs &ldquo;with Emmett Till and the Scottsboro Boys.&rdquo;  Which probably means he believes the &ldquo;official&rdquo; readings of those events.  Needless to say, the &ldquo;official&rdquo; stories about Emmett Till and the Scottsboro Boys, as PJB himself did say in that same paragraph about the Jena Six Thugs, are more mythical than truthful.<br>

<p>Clear, courageous, and concise.  That&rsquo;s the Pat Buchanan way.  The above line says it all.</p>
<p>The people involved on Barker&rsquo;s side who were demonized by CNN, Al, Jesse, and the leftist press, should all be scrutinized very closely by Barker&rsquo;s lawyers to determine if civil cases against them should go forward.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect Bono or another radical celebrity dork to jump forward to right this wrong by contributing money to the white victims in order to help defray their legal costs.  Their heads are too firmly placed where the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine to be truly aware of what the real world is all about.</p>
<p>This incident is every bit as bad as the the Tawana Brawley case.</p>
<p>Will we ever see justice before we are in a position in the near future to demand it?<br>

			<p>The problem was never finding out the truth.  The truth was known the very day this happened.</p>
<p>The problem is, most people don&rsquo;t care.  Or, if they do care, they are waaaay too cowardly or lazy to do anything about it.</p>
<p>This election is a perfect example.  Everything about the Jena 6 is epitomized by Obama.  It looks like he is likely going to be the democratic candidate.  But republicans can&rsquo;t be bothered to muster their forces against him.  I have serious worries that everyday republicans won&rsquo;t even bother to vote against him.</p>
<p>Maybe they need to have Jena 6 a daily occurence, many times in THEIR town, in order to motivate them.</p>

			<p>Boy, this is a big surprise,  the media got most of the basics in this story wrong. In fact, this is a common occurrence with so-called professional journalists. They obviously make it up as they go along. Again, it looks that many, if not most, so-called professional journalists (usually from left-wing newspapers) have completely abdicated their any professional ethics to report the facts  truthfully. Many seem only to report the &#8220;facts&#8221; as they want them to be in order to support some liberal bias. And, the newspapers they work for print their editorial pieces on page one as news. It is becoming very hard to believe anything the major newspapers say. Their reporters are a disgrace to professional journalism. Myths replace facts and almost always with a political slant.  I have never before witnessed such a disgrace in professional journalism. This type of &#8220;reporter&#8221; is just a charlatan posing as a journalist and the catastrophic loss of subscribers to such rags that employ these people such be appluded. <br>

			<p>I always see red when I hear people snorting about those awful white boys getting off with &#8216;a slap on the wrist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see them get evaluations by licensed mental-health professionals (read; state-appointed shrinks) and after a few weeks ask them if they still think that&rsquo;s a &#8216;slap on the wrist&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>SNOWMEN are racist and must be considered hate crimes.  The fact that a White child would build a pure White man of snow is a racist act.  Blacks have every right to do violence against SNOWMEN.  </p>

<p>When Buchanan ran for Prez last time, he chose a Black Woman as his running mate. (No, Pat, NO!)</p>
<p>His candidacy sank like a stone, &#8216;faster than a speeding bullet&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Pat B. wants to be liked in his old age, like Bill Buckley. And both have thereby become irrelevant.</p>

<p>Fergie actually came from a pop/rap/rock fusion group called the Black Eyed Peas(she was the only white member) and went solo so I wouldn&rsquo;t jump to conclusions about her &#8216;initiating&#8221; a cultural change.  Maybe she didn&rsquo;t like that particular rapper, who knows.  Don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions!</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go that far.</p>
<p>To use an old expression.  &#8220;Every little bit helps.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s foolish to pretend that, for now at least, we don&rsquo;t need all the help, in the form of publicity, we can get.</p>
<p>I look at both Buckley and Buchanan as two old streams that lead to a river, and the river to an ocean, though few are there yet.</p>
<p>Plus, they DID serve their purpose.  </p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t trust a lot of people here because they are too inflexible and I have yet to see, and I read quite a bit here, any REALLY good reasons for their inflexibility, which suggests that it&rsquo;s about something other than Race Realism.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get OUT of the Black and White world of Good/Bad, Left/Right, etc. and mover into a larger reality.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my understanding that Race Realism is about wanting to live in Reality.  How in the world can you do that while clinging to absolutes?  Especially since your sworn enemy, the Left, has done as good a job as anyone could hope, to expose the intellectual corruption of absolutes and how they lead to an insane, inverted world, the world we live in now, and are trying desperately to free ourselves from.</p>

			<p>Buchanan has cited &#8220;The Color of Crime&#8221; in one of his articles.  That alone speaks to his support of AmRen&rsquo;s general mission.  He&rsquo;s always said that the USA is a European country.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to malign him when Buchanan has steered plenty of folks in our direction.</p>
<p>As for the Reform Party ticket, Buchanan may have nominated a black woman, but that was also the Reform Party.  Buchanan has said that he loved DC, even when it was segregated.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a good quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Trying to justify apartheid in South Africa, Buchanan denounced the notion that &#8220;white rule of a black majority is inherently wrong. Where did we get that idea? The Founding Fathers did not believe this.&#8221; (syndicated column, 2/7/90) He referred admiringly to the apartheid regime as the &#8220;Boer Republic&#8221;: &#8220;Why are Americans collaborating in a U.N. conspiracy to ruin her with sanctions?&#8221; (syndicated column, 9/17/89)&#8221;</p>

			<p>The Jena episode was a whole new level of outrage. This was a vicious black on white hate crime that the black supremacists and their leftist white enablers INVERTED to falsely portray as an act of WHITE racism!<br>
As though it weren&rsquo;t enough that information on black on non-black racial atrocities were simply censored.<br>
Every time some horrific black on white racial atrocity happened, they would say that &#8220;robbery&#8221; was the &#8220;motive&#8221;. Even though there was grisly torture, rape, and murder. The crime of robbery was the LEAST of it! What was the motive for the torture, rape, and murder? Such as occurred during the black on non-black HI FI, Wichita, Knoxville, Tifton, etc. massacres?<br>
But even when there is no robbery, they STILL won&rsquo;t categorize gratuitous random black on non-black murders as hate crimes, such as the Brian Gromowski and Robert Osborne cases in Kansas City Missouri, where whites where shot dead by passing blacks &#8220;just for fun&#8221;.<br>
On the other hand, ANY alleged white on black incident is IMMEDIATELY treated as racial, such as the Tawana Brawley hoax and the Durham hoax. Even the Emmitt Till case from over half a century ago they keep harping on endlessly was not racially motivated: The motive was clear. Emmitt Till was murdered by the outraged husband of the woman that Till had loudly whistled at in public, humiliating her. That did not justify murder. But race was not the motive. People are murdered every day in black neighborhoods today for a lot less provocation than that: Like just &#8220;looking at&#8221; someone wrong, or &#8220;dissing&#8221; someone in some fashion.<br>

			<p>      You can&rsquo;t love Western Culture and not love the people<br>
who created it. You can&rsquo;t love Traditonal America and not<br>
love the people who comprised it. Yes, I speak of the White<br>
Race. It is as natural to love one&rsquo;s people as it to love one&rsquo;s<br>
land. I don&rsquo;t have to explain this. But Flemming and Wilson<br>
have to explain why they don&rsquo;t love their people. Or do they<br>
claim that the White Race has nothing to do with the achiev-<br>
ments of Western Culture-that anyone could have done it! Try<br>
telling a bilingual Chinese Gentleman that the Chinese People<br>
have no intrinsic relation to Chinese Culture. If and when he<br>
was able to understand you, he would turn away with amazed <br>
contempt. The Chinese do not suffer from any such Cartesian<br>
Social Schizophrenia. That &#8220;Paleo-Conservatives&#8221; suffer thus<br>
is tragic. The service they might have rendered is abrogated;<br>
their mission aborted. How can they help America when they <br>
don&rsquo;t even know who Americans are? Surely they don&rsquo;t believe<br>
in the polygot, multicultural nightmare that we before us? <br>
Perhaps they might open their Bibles to Genesis and review<br>
the story of the Tower of Babel.</p>

			<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there a time when white, conservative men weren&rsquo;t apologetic and didn&rsquo;t cater to the whims of race hustlers?  Maybe those men are long gone now.  Shame.  I look at the old dying white men as the last generation of real white men.  These men fought a world war, raised white-conscious families, and did everything in their power to stop the likes of Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.  Now all that&rsquo;s left over are wannabe gangsters, wiggers, and men trying to &#8216;get in touch with their feminine inside.&rsquo;  </p>

			<p>&#8220;YEs. He just promised 700 million dollars to Tanzania to build new and refurbish existing infrastructure while ours crumbles. They love him in Africa. &#8220;</p>
<p>Just think, that money could  provide free medical care for every uninsured or underinsured american citizen in the country. Yet, Dubya wants to cut aid to american citizens while handing over  OUR money to africa or other places where they hate us. God, the government makes me sick sometimes.</p>

			<p>Wilson and Fleming! What can one say about an historian and classical scholar who romanticize the Confederacy while hating race realists who simply want to protect whites from black and &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; violence and revanchism and end massive Third-World immigration. Now one can&rsquo;t even tell the truth about black intelligence, black crime, black-on-white violence, etc., at Chronicles, Takimag, and Lewrockwell without being censored or vilified.</p>

			<p>Just about EVERY anti-Black race-crime reported is a SCAM! Not that Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson (that name reminds me of something else) would want White Americans to find this out.</p>
<p>The &#8220;pity me, I was born Black&#8221; mentality also draws ample support from those blithering idiots teaching those absurd WHITE PRIVILEGE classes at our colleges and universities. NOT, of course that those &#8220;learned pedagogues&#8221; actually BELIEVE that ideologic pig-swill, but because these &#8220;esteemed professors&#8221; quickly learned peddling this slop is a fast track to tenure. That you just can&rsquo;t go wrong, getting published for writing this type of trash. That way the professor rides a sure-fire path to more wasted grant money, more prestige among his/her peers. But that, too, is an &#8220;inconvenient truth&#8221; they&rsquo;d rather we normal people don&rsquo;t think about.</p>
<p>Hey, even SLAVERY was not as bad as that piece of utter trash: &#8220;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&#8221;. Rank fiction written as an early anti-slavery propaganda piece. Most slave-owners treated their chattel decently enough. Rewarded them for good performance with gifts of money, better food, better clothing. Many slave-owners even provided for the freeing of their slaves in their wills!</p>
<p>As to brutally beating slaves half to death, punishing them with amputation of limbs   &mdash;   PURE HOLLYWOOD HOGWASH! Common sense tells you no farmer would deliberately ill-treat a valuable slave. Rending him incapable of work. Slaves, like prize horses, fine cattle   &mdash;   were to costly, too valuable to ruin with mistreatment! (The Hollywood Propaganda Machine learned five, six decades ago, people like  watching fake blood and gore, forget the nonsense of historical accuracy!)</p>
<p>But PULEEZE don&rsquo;t let these inconvenient truths stop you from accepting those hackneyed twin excuses of &#8220;slavery and post-slavery discrimination&#8221; flung around as &#8220;justification or an excuse&#8221; whenever Blacks commit their daily crimes. Or for their utterly dismal historic record as a race. (Their African cousins have just as good an excuse for the mess they&rsquo;ve managed to create in today&rsquo;s Africa. Only instead of slavery, they blame THEIR collective failures on the effects of colonialism.</p>

			<p>And friends, here&rsquo;s STILL MORE EVIDENCE, what fine, decent, gentle people Afro-Americans really are&hellip; But then we&rsquo;ve known all along these poor Afro-Americans are just frustrated over slavery and its aftermath   &mdash;   generations earlier, right?</p>
<p>VIDEO: Shopper Knocked Out Over Small Aisle Space<br>
Shocking Video Shows Man Floored In NYC Market<br>
Reporting<br>
Sean Hennessey<br>
NEW YORK (CBS) ― A shocking scene was recently caught on video, a tape police hope will lead to a quick arrest.</p>
<p>The unbelievable images show a shopper just trying to pay up at a corner deli, when out of nowhere he is laid out with a haymaker that conjures memories of a young Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>CBS 2 HD was at the market in lower Manhattan Tuesday night to try to get to the bottom of what caused the nightmare scenario.</p>
<p>The customer&rsquo;s nightmare unfolded innocently enough as he was standing at the counter paying for some items just after midnight on Jan. 6. The shopper, a white man wearing a white coat, suddenly gets walloped by a black man in a dark vest and gray hoodie. Thanks to the deli&rsquo;s security cameras, police now have a fairly clear picture of the assailant as the entire sordid affair was captured from several angles.<br>

<p>Huh?  They&rsquo;re the ones that knuckled under in the culture wars, and allowed their children to be raised by the victors.</p>
<p><i>They knew better and did nothing</i>.</p>

<p>This is like recent videos of a young black male viciously beating elderly white ladies as they entered their apartments in New York City and another two videos from Texas, one where a young black male comes up to a counter and smashes an older white lady at the cash register over the head with a heavy whiskey bottle, and the other where the young black male comes up to an old white guy whose paying his bill at a 7-11 and sucker-punches him, knocking him out cold, then cooling going through his pockets stealing his wallet&hellip;.<br>
Am Ren really needs to have a video montage, or video library of these and thousands of others that dramatically document the daily black on non-black racial atrocities that occur in communities all across the country.</p>
