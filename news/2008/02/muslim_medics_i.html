						<p>HEALTH officials are having crisis talks with Muslim medical staff who have objected to hospital hygiene rules because of religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Women students at Liverpool&rsquo;s Alder Hey children&rsquo;s hospital have raised objections to removing their arm coverings in theatre and to rolling up their sleeves when washing their hands because it is regarded as immodest.</p>
<p>Minutes of a clinical academics&rsquo; meeting at Liverpool University revealed that female Muslim students at Alder Hey children&rsquo;s hospital had objected to rolling up their sleeves to wear gowns.</p>
<p>Similar concerns have been raised at Leicester University, and Sheffield University also reported a case of a Muslim medic who refused to &#8220;scrub&#8221; as this left her forearms exposed.</p>
<p>Some students have said that they would prefer to quit the course rather than expose their arms, but hygiene experts said no exceptions should be made on religious grounds.</p>
<p>A Royal Liverpool hospital spokesman said they had experienced issues of Muslim staff not sanitising their forearms with alcohol gel although this had now been addressed.</p>
<p>Dr Steve Ryan, medical director at Alder Hey said that while the &#8220;bare below the elbows&#8221; dress code is a matter of patient safety, the trust would work with Muslim students to find a solution.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We specify bare below elbows, no wrist watches, nail varnish or false nails in clinical areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good hand hygiene is one of the most important and simplest actions we can take to prevent healthcare associated infections.</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of female Muslim students had approached the University of Liverpool to ask if we would provide facilities for them to change their outerwear and Hijab for theatre scrubs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were pleased to accommodate this request and these facilities have now been incorporated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Charles Tannock, a Conservative MEP and former hospital consultant, said: &#8220;These students are being trained using taxpayers&rsquo; money and they have a duty of care to their patients not to put their health at risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps these women should not be choosing medicine as a career if they feel unable to abide by the guidelines everyone else has to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Islamic Medical Association insisted that covering all the body in public, except the face and hands, was a basic tenet of Islam.</p>
<p>It said: &#8220;No practising Muslim woman &mdash; doctor, medical student, nurse or patient &mdash; should be forced to bare her arms below the elbow.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>New rules for doctors</b></p>
<p>NEW Department of Health guidance introduced this month stipulates all doctors must be &#8220;bare below the elbow&#8221;.</p>
<p>The measure is deemed necessary to stop the spread of infections such as MRSA and Clostridium difficile (C.difficile), which have claimed the lives of hundreds.</p>
<p>Included in the rules are further infection control measures such as a ban on wrist watches, nail varnish, jewellery and false nails in clinical areas.</p>
<p>The code of practice will help NHS bodies to plan and implement how they can prevent and control healthcare-associated infections. It sets out criteria by which managers of NHS organisations are to ensure that patients are cared for in a clean environment and the risk of infections is kept as low as possible.<br>

			<p>It said: &ldquo;No practising Muslim woman &mdash; doctor, medical student, nurse or patient &mdash; should be forced to bare her arms below the elbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And no Caucasian should be forced to bear their germy presence&hellip;  If the prevailing sanitation practices of White, Western medicine do not comport with Muslim religious sensibilities, then they should obviously be practicing medicine/receiving their medical care in a non-White, ISLAMIC country.  Deport these pigs now!!!</p>

			<p>All the more reason to DEMAND that you be treated by a White Christian medical professional when one visits the doctor or dentist.  The Islamics are far from the only lax individuals when it comes to following White rules in White countries.</p>

			<p>O.K. Now I am forced to ask the question &#8220;are there any &#8216;arm&rsquo; men out there?&#8221; Who, in God&rsquo;s name, gets turned on by a forearm??? Immodest?? How about potentially deadly. You can put a suit on a monkey, but he remains a monkey. These people do not belong in the U.K. or any other western country, let alone working in any kind of medical facility. When will the white nations wake up? They will never integrate. They will never fit in. They don&rsquo;t want to change themselves, they want to change us, our nations, our people, and our culture. I fear for the U.K. Especially in that country, the leadership seems totally out of touch with reality. If it were just themselves they were putting in jeopardy, I wouldn&rsquo;t care, but every Briton and every aspect of British culture is at great risk. As an aside, do you think these modest muslim women would object at a real doctor looking at their arm, or leg, or any other part of their anatomy if the risk to them was losing life or limb if they didn&rsquo;t allow it? Who&rsquo;s B.S&rsquo;ing who here?  </p>

			<p>Joseph Lister is turning over in his grave&hellip; But you  know what? Good! In the coming unpleasantness, the importance of surgical  recovery rates will be right up there with birth rates. And our side will scrub and theirs won`t. </p>

<p>So go ahead and quit then and, while you&rsquo;re at it, leave the country and go back to your islamic paradise where you belong. You are NOT wanted here and the majority of us, the native born citizens, would gladly pay your way out of here, as well as for the removal of your DOLE-dependent relatives.</p>

			<p>Just another cultural/racial misunderstanding on the part of Whites. We are reaping what we sow.</p>

			<p>An operating theatre is hardly a public place.  Do they really believe that the operating surgeon or anaesthetist might be distracted by the sight of a woman&rsquo;s arm? These medieval lunatics shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed anywhere near a modern hospital.</p>

<p>Probably. You must remember that Arab men are reputed to be very oversexed.</p>

			<p>There should be no &#8216;talks&rsquo; of negotiation. Those Muslim women are not irreplaceable. Their religion only allows them to stay at home; meek, modest, covered, scared, and subservient to their husband. Their religion won&rsquo;t allow them to mix and intermingle with other ways.</p>
