<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>For eight days, protesters paraded in front of one of Little Saigon&rsquo;s leading newspapers. They carried an effigy of Ho Chi Minh and called the editors &#8220;traitors&#8221; for running a photo they said was so offensive that it had to be the work of communist sympathizers.</p>
<p>Two top editors at the newspaper were replaced several days later.</p>
<p>The offending photo was of a piece of art by a UC Davis graduate student and Vietnamese immigrant who saw the creation &mdash; a yellow and red foot-spa tub &mdash; as a salute to Vietnamese refugees like her mother-in-law who toiled in a nail salon after the family came to America.</p>
<p>But the protesters saw something far more menacing.</p>
<p>The tub was yellow with three red stripes, which the protesters said must be a reference to the flag of the fallen country of South Vietnam. And the spa&rsquo;s yellow power cord was plugged into a red outlet, which seemed to resemble the flag of the communist-ruled Socialist Republic of Vietnam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is the South Vietnamese flag on a thing that people wash their dirty feet in?&#8221; asked UC Van Nguyen, 70, who attended some of the rallies, which began in late January.</p>
<p>Such loud and jeering protests are not unusual in the United States&rsquo; largest Vietnamese enclave, where the line between free expression and traitorous behavior remains paper-thin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the recent rallies outside the newspaper, protesters said that despite the abundant freedoms in America, artists must practice self-restraint to avoid insulting a community where the memories of war and struggle still linger.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The photo of the artwork, titled &#8220;Connection,&#8221; was printed in the Vietnamese lunar new year edition of a magazine published by Nguoi Viet, the largest daily newspaper in Little Saigon.</p>
<p>During the protests, which ended early this month, demonstrators paraded around the newspaper&rsquo;s parking lot, yelling &#8220;Down with communists! Down with Nguoi Viet newspaper!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Little Saigon, which stretches through several communities in central Orange County, officials in Westminster and Garden Grove have banned the communist Vietnamese flag from official functions. And it is customary for merchants to fly the old South Vietnamese banner in front of businesses. Some non-Vietnamese politicians in the area pose with the flag on campaign literature.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the artist said she had no intention of offending anyone when she bought a foot spa from a nail shop, painted it yellow and red, and submitted it for a scholarship while she was a student at UC Berkeley. She is now a graduate student at UC Davis.&#8221;People can think that I demean their flag, but that is not my intention,&#8221; said Chau Huynh, who was incorrectly identified in the article as Chau Thuy Tran. &#8220;When you talk about red and yellow, it&rsquo;s the Vietnamese traditional colors that I fall in love with. Both flags are yellow and red.&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw the art creation as a way to honor Vietnamese women who have &#8220;toiled and sacrificed enormously for the future of their children and family,&#8221; she wrote in a piece explaining the art, which was translated into Vietnamese and ran next to the image in the Nguoi Viet magazine.</p>

					<p>Good on Vietnamese-Americans for resisting even the slightest taint on their historical roots &amp; memories.</p>
<p>Some day, white American peoples in all their vibrancy &amp; diversity will pick up these same tools to protest the hateful content of film, print media, and electronic media, not to mention all the white-bashing groups like <span class="caps">ACLU, SPLC, ADL, PAW, </span>etc.</p>
<p>When European Americans finally become aware of the consequences of living as a minority in North America, perhaps they will unfurl some of these same techniques.</p>

					<p>Well someone should tell these people that most Vietnamese did support the communists, which is why the war was unwinnable. But I&rsquo;m most concerned about the editors.  Are we to understand that because of a misunderstanding, which most Americans don&rsquo;t care about, people and their families have lost their income? Is it yet another case of &#8216;someones feeling are hurt so you no longer have a right to eat&rsquo;?</p>

<p>Probably up to 50% and the other half didn&rsquo;t care one way or another. We were a cash cow for S. Vietnam. The whole country wasn&rsquo;t worth one drop of American Blood. They wouldn&rsquo;t defend their flag then, so don&rsquo;t come here protesting.  </p>

					<p>The United States should never, ever, ever, have intervened in South Vietnam. 58,000 young Americans were killed and the <span class="caps">USA </span>was forced to absorb &#8216;imperial backwash&rsquo; in the form of Vietnamese &#8216;refugees&rsquo;. Now the same scenario is unfolding in Iraq. Note how both wars were based on a fraud. The alleged &#8220;attack&#8221; on Americans in the Gulf of Tonkin (even though not one single American was even slightly injured in this &#8220;attack&#8221;) and the <span class="caps">WMD </span>lie. The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>should abandon it&rsquo;s foolish foreign interventionist policies, especially now that it no longer has a major global competitor with the implosion of the <span class="caps">USSR.</span> Instead the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>has gone exactly in the <span class="caps">WRONG DIRECTION, </span>expanding <span class="caps">NATO </span>recklessly, when it should have been disbanded, entrenching itself in South Korea, Japan and Okinawa (where a marine just raped a 14-year old girl) and antagonizing China over Taiwan, an obscure island of zero economic and strategic importance to the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> The military and political elites in Washington seem determined to establish an American imperium for themselves. They know most Americans know little and care even less about foreign policy (&#8216;hey man, the superbowl is on&rsquo;) and they want their little empire for themselves to play around with. The 9/11 attacks were a direct consequence of America&rsquo;s foreign policy and its meddling in other countries affairs specifically the stationing of <span class="caps">U.S. </span>troops in Saudi Arabia. This was Bin Laden&rsquo;s  biggest motivation for the attacks not hatred of America because it is &#8220;free&#8221; (George Bush and Fox news notwithstanding). By the way this does <span class="caps">NOT </span>mean that the Americans killed that day deserved to die, I am simply offering an explanation for the motivation of the perpetrators. The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>continues to establish its military bases all around the world even while its own southern border crumbles away like the medieval fool who puts out the fire in his neighbour&rsquo;s house while his own burns to the ground.</p>

<p>Was it a nail salon for coal miners <span class="caps">WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY </span>down deep underground maybe?  Seriously, have you been in some of the Asian nail salons lately?  They stink of chemicals.  The workers &#8220;toil&#8221; away with their masks on because they are crammed in there like sardines, possibly illegally, and they are probably using polish that is imported and has God knows what in it.  I wish someone would devise a system to measure the levels of unhealthy chemicals in those places.  I also wish I had a job that allowed me to sit on my tushie all day and file and paint nails.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve never been in a nail salon, but I&rsquo;ve done lots of factory work, when the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>still had lots of factories.  Doing nails isn&rsquo;t coal mining, but it&rsquo;s not that different than sitting at a workbench and making coinboxes for slot machines all day, and it&rsquo;s no more frivolous either.  It&rsquo;s damned tiring to do that sort of work, I know.  I&rsquo;m sure it calls for a steady hand and knowledge of the techniques and materials, and it&rsquo;s an entirely voluntary exchange, so your tax dollars play no part.  Criticize their politics or their loyalties or their race, but their craft deserves respect.   </p>

					<p>In Buddhism, the feet are considered dirty, placing a flag of the former South Vietnam in a device that your feet would rest upon, 32 years after the fall of Saigon is basically akin to placing an image (or a close facsimile..) of the Confederate flag on the bottom of a toilet in 1897. </p>
<p>I realize there are bunch of people flooding into the US who wish to impose their values and way of life on us (all in the name of diversity and multiculturalism.. cough&hellip;)  but I sympathize with the Vietnamese protesters in this case. The leftists historians shy away from discussing what the VC did to &#8220;persuade&#8221; villagers to follow them and tend to portray the American soldiers as evil or dupes. </p>

					<p>8:51 AM Poster:</p>
<p> Sigh. So many Americans are just like you. Where did I say that the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>should have &#8220;packed its bags and gone home after <span class="caps">WW2</span>&#8221;??? I <span class="caps">SAID THE U.S. SHOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM ITS OVERSEAS COMMITTMENTS AFTER</span> 1991 <span class="caps">WHEN THE USSR IMPLODED.</span> There is a huge difference between 1991 and 1945 sir. Take Europe for example. The Berlin wall fell. Germany was re-united. The Warsaw pact collapsed. Eastern Europe was liberated and the <span class="caps">USSR </span>collapsed into fifteen states. With the exception of the tiny Kalingrad exclave the military frontier of Russia was pushed back from the Elbe to beyond the Pripet marshes more then a 1,000 miles. Now was the time for the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>to say to Europe, &#8216;okay you are now safe we are leaving&rsquo;. Nato should have been dissolved. Instead the Bureacratic and military-industrial complex self-preservation instinct kicked in. Nato was expanded again and again even though it had no enemy to fight against. The Americans invented a new enemy when it attacked Serbia. Unlike the foolish Americans the Europeans wasted no time cashing in their peace dividend. Germany had <span class="caps">TWELVE </span>divisions in 1989 in its army, today only three. <span class="caps">EVER WONDER WHY UNIVERSITY EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE ARE FREE</span> IN <span class="caps">GERMANY BUT NOT</span> IN <span class="caps">THE U.S.</span>? Imagine what could be done with all that money if <span class="caps">U.S. </span>military spending was reduced by 75%?  </p>
<p> As far as South Korea goes it has twice the population of North Korea and its economy is <span class="caps">FORTY </span>times as large. It has a huge technical lead over the north which is starving and dirt-poor. I see no reason why Americans still have to deploy troops there 55 years <span class="caps">AFTER THE WAR ENDED</span>! Why can&rsquo;t <span class="caps">S.K. </span>look after itself? Just how long exactly do you want American troops stationed there anyways? Do you realize how much money all these bases cost the American taxpayer?<br>
As far as places like Angola are concerned I can hardly think of a less neccesarry place for American soldiers to be in. As to being &#8220;surrounded&#8221; by hostile Marxist states, communism is discredited around the world and has been irrelevant since 1991.</p>
<p> I see no reason for the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>navy to be deployed in the Straits of Hormuz. Oil traffic will be maintained because it is in Iran&rsquo;s interests to do so. They need export markets. The job of the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>navy should be to defend the shores of America, not to engage in &#8220;in your face&#8221; actions like the ludicrous Gulf of Tonkin actions. How would Americans like it if Vietnamese naval ships were operating just 13 miles off the shores of California or Oregon?</p>

					<p>10:21 PM makes an important point about <span class="caps">ARVN </span>resistance and US congressional penury.  The ammunition loadout for the average <span class="caps">ARVN </span>soldier in 1975 was twenty rifle cartridges and two hand grenades.</p>
<p>They clobbered the <span class="caps">NVA </span>in the 1972 Eastertide offensive, and could have done so again in 1975 if we hadn&rsquo;t so completely let them down.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Oil traffic will be maintained because it is in Iran&rsquo;s interests to do so. &#8220;</p>
<p>Why do people like you insist that others will act in a manner rational to the US? When the US declared South Korea outside it&rsquo;s vital interest, it was attacked. If it was so outside the interests of the <span class="caps">US, </span>then why did the <span class="caps">USA </span>supply the bulk of the UN forces? Apparently, it&rsquo;s value must have been something of importance to the US after the North attacked. Did those that sowed the mines in Iran act in a manner rational to the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>before Operation Preying Mantis? Clearly, your rationality argument on the part of other nations meshing with the interests of the <span class="caps">USA </span>falls apart. You want <span class="caps">NATO </span>to fall apart? Fine. The Europeans can fend for themselves and form any security arrangement they want. But note that the Ukraine, once part of the old <span class="caps">USSR, </span>wants IN into <span class="caps">NATO.</span> Does Ukraine want to be an enemy of Russia? Doubtful. But now Russia threatens to target ballistic missiles on the Ukraine. Rational? Power politics? You decide.</p>

					<p>9:24 PM <span class="caps">POSTER</span>:  </p>
<p> South Korea is not and never has been a vital interest of the United States. The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>could very easily live with a wholly totalitarian Korean peninsula. Why did the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>supply the bulk of the UN forces? The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>reasoned - wrongly - that it had to &#8220;show resolve&#8221;, or in other words it chose to use force to show it could use force, a negation of strategy and logic. 33,000 Americans died in this unnecesarry war but at least the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>was able to achieve <span class="caps">SOMETHING.</span> It saved <span class="caps">S.K. </span>although the loss of it would not in anyway have compromised America and the loss of 33,000 troops was probably too high a price to pay, but regardless. That the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>was able to achieve this in Korea but not Vietnam was due to the fact that Korea is a peninsula and the inter-Korean border is only 187 miles long. It was fairly easy to seal off the south. Vietnam on the other hand had extremely long and vulnerable land borders which the north was prepared to exploit shamelessly. Only moving a corps-sized force into Laos to cut the trail and stay there would have given <span class="caps">S.V. </span>even a remote fighting chance. Eisenhower had himself concluded this in his private study of Indo-China and told this to both Kenneddy and Johnson. He was ignored. As for the Ukraine joining <span class="caps">NATO, </span>that would be great - for Ukraine. It gets American protection and security and America gets,,, nothing. Sweet deal if you can get it. I don&rsquo;t see how or why American soldiers need to safeguard Ukrainian citizens. The job of the American armed forces should be to protect America, nothing else. We should not be the world&rsquo;s Robo-Cop. Iran is not as irrational as you seem to think. It has invaded no country for more then 250 years unlike the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> How would you react if Iran had invaded and occupied Mexico under the Fraud of <span class="caps">WMD </span>and its navy was operating in the Gulf of Mexico of the coast of Texas where the refineries are? And then to have an Iranian president accuse America of aggression!!! You really don&rsquo;t get it do you? The truth is America is a declining power and is headed for an economic collapse (and probably, yet further down the road, racial Balkanization.) There is going to be a siesmic shift in global power before too long and America&rsquo;s imperium will be revealed for the sham that it is. You are going to learn the truth.</p>

<p>Vietnamization Begins </p>
<p>&#8220;As the US accelerated the transfer of its equipment to the South Vietnamese government in the fall of 1969 in a program referred to as &#8220;Vietnamization,&#8221; the gunship squadrons began transferring their AC-47 aircraft to the <span class="caps">VNAF.</span> Like the Phoenix rising from the ashes to fly again, 16 of the Dragonships from the 3d and 4th <span class="caps">SOS </span>were resurrected in 1969 as the <span class="caps">VNAF&rsquo;</span>s 817th Combat Squadron, popularly known as the &#8220;Fire Dragons.&#8221; The new squadron&rsquo;s performance awed <span class="caps">USAF </span>evaluators, one of whom was moved to report, &#8220;This squadron is better than any <span class="caps">USAF</span> AC-47 squadron that was ever over here.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Jack S. Ballard&rsquo;s The United States Air Force in Southeast Asia: Development and Employment of Fixed-Wing Gunships, 1962-1972 is the definitive book on <span class="caps">USAF </span>gunship operations in Southeast Asia. In this book, Ballard explains the superlatives given to the Fire Dragons by <span class="caps">USAF </span>observers. While the average American AC-47 pilot accrued 800 combat hours during his one-year tour in Vietnam, the Vietnamese gunship pilots began their AC-47 duty having already accumulated 6,000 to 12,000 hours in the C-47. And, the Vietnamese pilots never rotated out of combat duty. If not killed or crippled in combat, they only got better and better at their deadly business. And, perhaps naturally, the Vietnamese pilots seemed to have a better knack for picking out terrain and enemy assault formations at night than did their <span class="caps">USAF </span>counterparts. Within six months of the activation of the 817th, the squadron was flying AC-47s in all four military regions of South Vietnam. Acting as forward air controllers on occasion, the Fire Dragons quickly discovered that the highly experienced Vietnamese gunship pilots knew their business. And in addition to the Fire Dragons, there were still other Asian pilots in Indochina capable of flying the AC-47 with deadly effect against North Vietnamese. A final twist was in store for the old gunships, however, as the <span class="caps">VNAF </span>transferred four of their newly acquired AC-47s to the Royal Laotian Air Force during this period. </p>

					<p>&#8220;The United States gained nothing from its Vietnam intervention.&#8221;</p>
<p>War has been the great driver of technology in the battlefield of the 20th century. So on the contrary, we learned a lot, so much so that even the Chinese realised that they couldn&rsquo;t win <span class="caps">UNLESS </span>they began copying the Americans. America started the revolution in Precision Guided Munitions, starting with laser guided bombs in Vietnam. We perfected image intensification so that we could fight at night. We developed <span class="caps">GPS </span>so we engage all weather attack. We amazed the world and the Chinese when we took Iraq down in a matter of weeks. So yes, on the contrary, what we gained from Vietnam, was not &#8220;nothing,&#8221; but <span class="caps">EVERYTHING </span>in terms of fighting future wars.</p>

<p>As Rush Limbaugh states: &#8220;Wars are to kill people and break things.&#8221; On that, I stand by what I said. The <span class="caps">REASON </span>one decides to got to war is irrelevant to my argument.</p>
<p>You want to know the truth about why we went to war on Iraq?</p>
<p>Get the movie Fahrenheit 9/11.</p>
<p>After you watch it, ask yourself <span class="caps">ONE </span>question:</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Micheal Moore mention even <span class="caps">ONCE </span>the word &#8220;neocon&#8221; or &#8220;neoconservative?&#8221;</p>
<p>As Sam Francis pointed out in vdare.com:</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/francis/rush_and_neocons.htm</p>
<p>&#8220;What Mr. Limbaugh actually said on his radio program last week was</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m getting a little tired of these media people speaking in their own code language. A case in point is their use of the term &#8216;neo-conservative.&rsquo; Whether they choose to hyphenate the label or not, it&rsquo;s a pejorative code word for &#8216;Jews.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>

					<p>The Vietnam War was fought mainly to keep the drug trade going for the <span class="caps">CIA </span>on one hand, Meyer Lansky and his mob on the other. Not Politically Correct, but the truth. Both sides worked together to make sure the money was coming in. It&rsquo;s not a conspiracy theory, just fact if one digs deep enough. It was one of the reasons <span class="caps">JFK </span>had so much friction with the <span class="caps">CIA. LBJ </span>came in and rubber stamped the <span class="caps">CIA </span>(and organized crime&rsquo;s) every wish after he came in, and rubber stamped all legislation put through by the Marxists, including the Immigration Act of 1965.  </p>
