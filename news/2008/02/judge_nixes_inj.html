						<p>PHOENIX &mdash; A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a request by business groups to put Arizona&rsquo;s employer sanctions law on hold while the groups appeal a ruling that upheld the law.</p>
<p>In rejecting the injunction request, U.S. District Judge Neil Wake ruled that the business groups &#8220;don&rsquo;t have a probability of success of appeal, much less a strong probability.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2007 law prohibits businesses from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants and suspends or revokes business license penalties for violators. The business groups are seeking to overturn the law.</p>
<p>Wake also said one factor in his latest decision was that the depression of wages for legal workers from illegal immigrants is far greater than the minimal costs of employers complying with the law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law took effect Jan. 1 but prosecutors agreed to not file any enforcement cases before March 1 to allow time for the court challenge.</p>

			<p>  Finally a Judge remembers that American citizens have a right to the jobs that perjuring aliens have held.<br>
  Please everyone tell McCain, Hillary and Messiah Obama (obamamessiah.blogspot.com ) that American citizens and not fraud commiting illegal aliens have a right to the jobs in the US and that they all took an oath to protect the USA ( supposedly a government of the people, by the people and for the people of the USA not for foreigners) against all enemies foreign and domestic. </p>

			<p>They will try to find another Federal Judge who will issue the injunction.  Maybe one of the Supremes will pull it up for hearing before the court.</p>

			<p> When judges stand for the law and the groups circumventing the law will stop stealing, lying, cheating, and committing fraud.  Just because a person is illegal or hire illegals does not mean they can operate outside USA laws.  This is what most foreign illegals I meet think.  They live and work here but do not view themselves as jurisdictions of this country.  Their objective is to live outside our laws. Most noteably is their defiance of Americans and the belief they are rightous and deserving of everything they steal&hellip;     Apparently most politicians and courts agree with them.   Special thanks to this judge who has the moral courage to stand for USA laws and its citizens.    V</p>

			<p>Gee, these business men might be forced to move their businesses to a foreign country.  What a shame that profit is more important than integrity.  Were going to pay $5 for a tomato whether we hire illegals or not.</p>

			<p>Hopefully, this will start a domino effect in other states.  Illegals moving out of Arizona into Idaho will spark legislation in that state.  The illegals will move from Idaho to Oregon again causing lawmakers to crack down.  Eventually even California will have to capitulate or face a swarm of 15,000,000 - 30,000,000 living in the state!!! </p>

			<p>Judge Wake is, ironically enough, a Republican who gave money to Jeff Flake and Jim Kolbe (prior to his becoming a judge) and was appointed to his position by George W Bush.</p>
<p>It just serves as a reminder that on illegal immigration Republicans are bad but Democrats are even worse.</p>
<p>I have half a mind to find Judge Wake&rsquo;s work address and send him flowers, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be accused of bribing a jurist.</p>
<p>Thanks, judge. Somebody out here loves you!</p>
