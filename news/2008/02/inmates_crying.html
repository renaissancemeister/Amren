						<p>Non-white inmates at the Don Jail are &#8220;crying racism&#8221; and showing lots of attitude over the suspected actions of white guards, a union official said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inmates read the paper and listen to the news,&#8221; Don Ford, of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, said yesterday. &#8220;Some non-white inmates are crying racism and creating incidents which our officers have to deal with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some inmates believe white officers are behind threats over a three-year period to nine black officers at the Don and Metro West Detention Centre, Ford said.</p>
<p>The nine officers have been granted paid leave until the end of June as a probe continues, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The officers were having a hard time on the job,&#8221; Ford said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to prevent them from being re-victimized.&#8221;</p>
<p>A probe by Toronto Police and the ministry of community safety and correctional services has no suspects after three years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stress on the officers has been phenomenal.&#8221; Ford said. &#8220;They believe they can be working beside the same person who may be behind this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incidents of hate came to a boil last month after 20 black, and some white officers, walked off the job at the Don because of more threatening letters that arrived in December and the lack of progress in the investigation.</p>
<p>The black guards have been receiving threats at home or at the jail since January 2005. Some letters contained derogatory terms for blacks and mentioned the KKK, segregation and assaults on black women.</p>
<p>Ministry spokesman Stuart McGetrick said a lot of work is being done to restore trust at the facilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vast majority of our officers are professional and not involved in this behaviour,&#8221; McGetrick said. &#8220;There is a lot taking place behind the scenes to fix the situation.&#8221;<br>

			<p>This sounds like a typical Fake Crime.  It is probably one of the black guards sending the letters.  </p>

<p>Non-whites tend to &#8220;show lots of attitude&#8221; when they&rsquo;re pandered to.</p>

			<p>Indeed, carry out the investigation of the alleged threats, but why give these put-upon black guards a 6 month <b>paid</b> vacation? There are other duties to be performed within the organization that does not require their presence at the &#8220;offending&#8221; work places. Simply transfer them!</p>
<p>This action will only bring forth additional <i>BLACK</i> &#8220;victim&#8221; guards seeking compensation just as surely as fire follows a spark. </p>
<p>These blacks will never be able to return to their original workplaces due to the animosity they&rsquo;ve surely incurred by going public and tainting their fellow guards with the &#8216;racist&rsquo; label. The workplace atmosphere would reek of toxicity after their return. </p>
<p>Better yet&hellip;.why not follow the same route, as their clamoring for a &#8220;black-focused&#8221; Toronto school? &hellip;&hellip;.Segregated jails for black prisoners guarded by black officers only.</p>
<p>One problem with that solution&hellip;..much less need for white guards in a white-segregated jail. </p>
<p>Blacks (mostly immigrants or offspring of recent immigrants) account for only 8% of Toronto&rsquo;s population, but are responsible for about 80% of the crime.</p>

			<p>Let me get this staight. Black inmates are offended because their black jailers are being treated insensitively? Never in the history of the penal system has anything this absurd been said or published. It is beyond ridiculous. How incredibly stupid do they think we are? This has all the earmarks of a power grab. Either that or the drug shipments being brought in by their black jailers are being interrupted and they&rsquo;re pissed.</p>

			<p>one cannot know until all the facts are in, but these letter writing campaigns are often fraudulently perpetrated by the alleged &#8220;victims&#8221;. indeed, it would appear to be white officers who are bearing the brunt of this letter writing charade. they should be the ones demanding results.</p>

			<p>Almost invariably these cases turn out to be hoaxes perpetrated by the black &#8220;victims&#8221;. Yet the media never learns. Notice how AUTOMATICALLY they jump to the conclusion some white racists were behind these incidents. No other possibilities are considered, despite past history of this sort of thing. In reality it is whites who are the victims of the real hate crime: Being racially framed by blacks agitators. Here is a typical example:<br>

			<p>Are any of the aggrieved black prison guards officials for the guards&rsquo; union? Maybe this is a negotiating tactic for some contract provision (or a play for sympathy promotions).</p>

			<p>If, after three years they cannot figure out who or whom is doing this, it is because the threats are manufactured by one of those receiving them. Now that they have been given more than equal status to whites, it turns out that is not enough to make them better than whites at much of anything. So, in frustration, they will continue to make sham claims so they can get more out of whitey, its as simple as that.</p>
<p>If whites weren&rsquo;t such cowards, they would simply say so and send these people and their whiney simpering white enablers away. Simple as that, &#8220;just say no&#8221;.</p>

			<p>They (the black guards) are probably lying. I know blacks, and they&rsquo;ll lie. Just look at any famous black comedian who jokes about how their race is so poor at lying, but they do it anyway.</p>

			<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s because the &ldquo;news&rdquo; gives them that idea (that black &#8216;prison guards&rsquo; are being treated unfairly).&#8221;</p>
<p>As someone who was born and raised in small size city with a large state prison in town, I&rsquo;ve read these &#8216;corrupt cop&rsquo; cases before in the news. When I got older, I realized, we have either the most corrupt cops in the world, or this is just a recurring feature of the news directed toward the inmates themselves to either rile them up or make them feel better. I imagine nothing would do either better than reading about cops finding themselves on the wrong side of the law.</p>

			<p>The Toronto Sun (the city&rsquo;s only tabloid newspaper) was originally conceived as a conservative counterpoint to the liberal Toronto Star. In recent years, however, someone at the Sun appears to have figured out that the readership is browning, so the Sun has now become relentlessly multicult and easy prey for hoaxes of the sort that may be at work here.</p>
