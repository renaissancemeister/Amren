<p>Ask Gamino [Esmerelda Gamino of Rosa&rsquo;s Mexican Store] what impact a crackdown on illegal immigration would have on the eight-year-old family-owned business and the native of Mexico doesn&rsquo;t hesitate:</p>
<p>&#8220;We would have to close down,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We are nothing without the Hispanic community. I don&rsquo;t think we could survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some community leaders wonder whether Noel [Missouri] could either.</p>
<p>Although Hispanics make up less than 3 percent of Missouri&rsquo;s population, leaders in Noel estimate that more than half of the town&rsquo;s 1,500 residents hail from south of the border. No one knows for sure how many are here illegally. Some estimate at least half. It&rsquo;s a question rarely asked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Foreign workers flooded into this rural region over the past 20 years, drawn in large part by corporate poultry processing that transformed this once nearly all-white enclave into one of Missouri&rsquo;s more racially mixed communities.</p>
<p>The Hispanic influx swelled school enrollment, reinvigorated religious congregations and spurred a local development boom. Along Main Street, Sosa&rsquo;s Hair Dressing, a Mexican market and storefront Hispanic churches now stand side-by-side with the local cafe, bank and post office. Hispanics are buying homes, relocating relatives and establishing roots in the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;If all of a sudden you lose that, it would be hurtful,&#8221; said Mayor Paul Gardner, as he waited on customers at his sandwich shop. &#8220;It would be extremely hurtful.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&lsquo;GREAT PEOPLE&rsquo;</p>
<p>One obvious victim of a crackdown would be the city&rsquo;s biggest corporate benefactor &mdash; the Tyson poultry plant on the edge of town. Tyson provides about 10 percent of the town&rsquo;s $600,000 annual budget, free sewage treatment for many residents, and it helps underwrite many community events, Gardner said.</p>
<p>About 40 percent of the 1,000-member workforce is Hispanic. Although company officials said they have zero tolerance for illegal workers, town leaders say it&rsquo;s no secret that many who work at the plant do so in violation of immigration laws. And, they say, any kind of rigorous immigration enforcement would lead many who are here legally to accompany home family members who are not.</p>
<p>The prevailing belief around Noel is that Tyson would struggle to find Americans willing to fill the difficult production and maintenance jobs that pay from $8.35 to $14.30 an hour.</p>
<p>Although a few &#8220;old timers&#8221; may object to the influx of Hispanics and &#8220;would jump up and down with joy&#8221; if the plant closed, Gardner said, the loss &#8220;would be devastating&#8221; economically.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sister Adelida Esquivel [of Nativity of Our Lord Catholic Church] estimates as much as 80 percent of the church&rsquo;s overwhelmingly Hispanic congregation is in the country illegally. Without those parishioners, she says with certainty, the 36-year-old church would close. In her year and a half in the parish, the church has averaged about eight baptisms a month, she said. All were Hispanic.</p>
<p>Recently stepped up immigration enforcement in neighboring states is taking a toll on parish life, she said. When Arkansas and Oklahoma enacted tougher laws, several people stopped coming to church functions, she said.</p>
<p>Esquivel, who was born in the United States, said she had been stopped in Arkansas recently and asked whether she was in the country legally.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are scared,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem doesn&rsquo;t come from the Hispanics,&#8221; LeSueur [Deputy Sheriff Mike LeSueur] said. &#8220;It comes from a lack of understanding among the whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>&lsquo;DESIRE TO ACHIEVE&rsquo;</p>
<p>At Noel Elementary, the staff works hard to bridge any such misunderstandings, Principal Nick Nichols said. On a recent day, white and brown students mingle at cafeteria tables, chattering between bites of chicken nuggets.</p>
<p>On a nearby wall, two enlarged copies of the school&rsquo;s mission statement are displayed, one in English, the other in Spanish.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said he knew of cases in which deported parents had their school-age children taken in by other Hispanics in Noel. That way, the children could continue their education in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School is one of the few places where whites and Hispanics mix with ease. The adults, for the most part, move in separate worlds. Even some of the churches have separate facilities for whites and Hispanics.</p>
<p>On a recent afternoon, a group of seven men and women gathered for an English lesson. They asked that their names not be used out of fear they would be arrested. All said they were in the country illegally and had used false identification they easily purchased to get jobs at the Tyson plant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Given a choice, all said they would rather stay in Noel than return home. They say most people in Noel are friendly, though they acknowledge there is a gulf between Hispanics and whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The mayor, who is married to a woman who entered the country illegally but is now a naturalized citizen, is optimistic the two cultures can assimilate.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the mayor marrying an illegal. I&rsquo;m a white nationalist and dated a girl who was half-mexican. I just made her tell people she was Italian when we went out in public. We&rsquo;re only racists from the waist up folks? &#8220;Little-me&#8221; don&rsquo;t discriminate.</p>

			<p>As I recall Tyson was actually engaged in smuggling illegals into the country to work at their plants at 200 bucks a head to coyotes and housing them in company barracks. I recall some of their upper management was indicted&hellip;&hellip;but this soon disappeared from the MSM and I never heard another thing about it.</p>
<p>If their still blatantly hiriing illegals after that, you would have to assume they have the tacit approval of the Bush administration.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy any Tyson product for this reason and would urge you all to do the same.</p>

<p>no Hispanics do not indestand that the reason they prefer to live in a white nation is that whites like to enforce the Law.The reason hispanics leave the nations they come from is the corruption of their goverments.</p>

I see!   So it&rsquo;s not the people who are in violation of the law who are the problem, it&rsquo;s the whites who are not understanding enough. They are the problem.  And this coming from THE SHERIFF!</p>

			<p>What the good Sister doesn&rsquo;t tell you is although most of the parishoners are now illegals, the collection basket is almost empty.  The Mexicans give little and the Whites who laid the entire Church foundation are leaving. I&rsquo;ve seen it happen in several small towns in Arkansas.  And the Catholic Diocese hasn&rsquo;t figured it out yet.<br>

It must be so much better now, after that  depressing, awful &#8220;all-white enclave&#8221; has been reinvigorated and &#8220;transformed&#8221;.  Such an improvement!</p>
<p>Oops!  I notice they left out the word &#8220;vibrant&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but those storefront churches and Mexican markets don&rsquo;t sound like any improvement to me. Who wants to see their town turned into a grubby little Tijuana?  That&rsquo;s improvement?</p>
<p>Well, on second thought, maybe it is to Tyson Foods. I suspect that&rsquo;s the answer.  And therefore it is to the Sheriff and  the Mayor and  to all those who must kowtow to Tyson for their jobs.</p>
<p>I swear, it&rsquo;s stories like this that are enough to make me anti-capitalist.  The greedy rich are destroying America.<br>

			<p>OK, I am a Race Traitor for marrying a SE Asian, but she entered the USA 100% legally. I am disgusted with this clown of a mayor for marrying an illegal and then getting around the law to keep her here. The law is that she should have returned to her country and re-entered the USA with a Marriage Visa, but elected officials ignore these laws while the rest of us have to be separated from our wives/fiancees many months to comply with immigration regulations. As her naturalization was done illegally, he is giving foreign marriages a bad name.</p>

			<p>Oops, the mayor and sheriff forgot to mention, along w/increase in illegals came the crime, schools score among lowest in the nation, white owned businesses closed, replaced by taco stands staffed by diseas carrying unregulated employees, rise in money spent for social services are bankrupting the county, the small local hospital had too close, etc. etc, I could go on and on, but the truth of the matter is, that for each mexican who comes here and is working, there&rsquo;s maybe 5 or 6 parasites that also show up and chang the racial makeup of these small towns, and they end up w/mayor married to an illegal.</p>

&ldquo;If all of a sudden you lose that, it would be hurtful,&rdquo; said Mayor Paul Gardner, as he waited on customers at his sandwich shop. &ldquo;It would be extremely hurtful.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Well, Mayor Racetraitor, we whites are suddenly losing OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY to foreign invaders from an incompatible culture   &mdash;   and we find THAT rather &#8220;hurtful&#8221; too. So get out your Espanol-Ingles dictionary, take a drive over to the brown side of town, and see if you (or your illegal mail-order bride) can explain to the local undocumented chicken-pluckers why we&rsquo;re not happy about their presence here. </p>
<p>Other posters have endorsed a boycott of Tyson products for their (alleged) hiring of illegals. I am joining them. And if anyone has a list or a website about such companies to avoid, please share. <br>

<p>I can relate to that. Almost an identical experience.  And I totally agree with you. Have you ever questioned someone who did what the Mayor and his illegal alien did and contrast it with your own experience?  It&rsquo;s quite an exquisite situation if you can corner people like that face to face about it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent question.   If they&rsquo;re such an asset, and they are so good at &#8220;reinvigorating&#8221; the economy and &#8220;uplifting&#8221; these depressed little towns out of their torpor, then why can&rsquo;t they do the same back home? </p>
<p>If these glowing legends about them were true, then Mexico ought to be a gleaming showcase of progress and vitality.  Something is wrong in this picture!  (Of course, when the Mayor is married to one of them, you can hardly expect him to be objective.  And, come to think of it,  I&rsquo;d like to know who the sheriff has been sleeping with.)<br>

<p>Sounds like an improvement to me!</p>
<p>And close down the sheriff and the mayor&rsquo;s office while you&rsquo;re at it.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m betting that Deputy Mike LeSueur, the source of the &#8220;upgrade to the gene pool&#8221; comment, has eyes on being elected Sheriff someday, and wants to make good with the racial group he thinks will soon be the majority.</p>
<p>McDonald County, where Noel is, is as far southwest as you can get in Missouri.  Any further south, you&rsquo;re in Arkansas.  Any further west, you&rsquo;re in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Southwest Missouri is experiencing a big Hispanic increase.  Monett is another such town:</p>

			<p>Twenty years ago, I remember being horrified and outraged when I saw a story about a small California town on Mexico&rsquo;s border. The post office was booming and rented hundreds of post office boxes - way beyond the town&rsquo;s population. At the end of each month, the Mexicans crossed the border to go to their post office boxes and pick up their welfare checks! I suppose they provided business and income for the post office, the welfare department, etc., but that didn&rsquo;t make it any less of a travesty.</p>

			<p>Many of us make the point &#8220;boycott Tyson&#8221; which is the right thing to do. If we are left out of the &#8220;democratic&#8221; process, ie. our VOICE means NOTHING to government and business entities, then we must voice our displeasure with our feet and our dollars.<br>
If enough of us refuse to do business with those that hamstring us, like Tyson, cheap labor is not going to make any difference in their bottom line.<br>
When it becomes financial suicide for companies to hire and keep &#8220;cheap&#8221; labor, only then will a positive change occur.<br>
Look out for companies like GM to buy out their long term employees and &#8220;replace&#8221; them at half the salary - who do you think is going to get hired at those wages?<br>
And what sort of quality do you think automobiles built by ignorant fruit pickers and chicken butcherers will have?</p>

			<p>Love is blind and this mayor has fallen under its spell and that is alright, but what is not alright is for him to pander to any illegal beyond his wife.  He behaves as if he married the entire illegals community and is willing to give them his community as a wedding present to his woman.  George Bush&rsquo;s brother Jeb is also married to a Mexican and the treasonous Bush clan is betraying America in homage to this nitwit&rsquo;s wife.  The only question that remains is the manner in which America&rsquo;s traitors will be dispensed summary justice&hellip;            </p>

<p>You mean, at $32/hour, which is half of Delphi&rsquo;s recent employment cost (includes fringes).</p>
<p>Unions (those with governmentally enforced monopoly) are pure evil.  Ask me why, I may just tell you.<br>

			<p>Tyson foods wrecks another town. They&rsquo;ve already wrecked Arkansas.</p>
<p>Meat and poultry processors all operate the same way: they buy up the local politicians in small to midsize towns, get sweetheart tax breaks from same, then the politicians hose the taxpayers to build plants for the processors but the public goes along with it because they are promised good jobs at these processing plants. </p>
<p>At first that might be true, but in a few years the processors gradually replace the locals with legal and illegal immigrants to work for half of what the locals were making.</p>
<p>So not only do do these towns get robbed by their treasonous and greedy politicians in order to bring in an even more greedy and exploitative entity, the icing on the cake is that the locals not only have their town destroyed by an influx of third worlders but they have the privilege of paying all the social, welfare, medical, legal, educational costs of this imported workforce! </p>
<p>A more perfect screwjob is hard to imagine.</p>

AND &hellip; the locals have the further privilege of enjoying all their crime, garbage, drunken driving, shoplifting, school disruption,  etc.<br>
Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll wager none of the Tysons have the pleasure of living in Noel, Missouri.</p>

			<p>I used to live in Noel, Missouri and I used to be on the city council.  I must comment on this story.  First of all, it was Hudson&rsquo;s that used to bring up illegals by the busloads and drop them off at the local welfare office to sign up for food stamps.  After that, they were given a room where they shared with others where they had to sleep in shifts.  The room was provided for by Hudson&rsquo;s but the cost came out of the worker&rsquo;s check.  The workers would save what money they had and send for their families.  Tyson&rsquo;s bought out Hudson&rsquo;s but they knowingly hire illegals.  If questioned, their staff are required to say they didn&rsquo;t know.  Years ago, Main Street was lined with stores, now it is lined with a lot of hispanic churches.  Churches do not provide revenue or taxes for the city so how does this help the city?  Also, as citizens move away, the legal hispanics are buying up the properties.  They then have several families who are illegals ove in with them.  So now you have multi family units in three bedroom homes etc.  In addition, how many illegals are paying taxes for the schools where they sent their children?  How much more cost is it for the school to provide english classes for the illegal children that do not know english?  Illegal women come here to have their babies so their babies can have dual citizenship.  Of course, the cost of the births are paid for by the state.  I can go on and on.  The town leadership is a joke.  The sheriff deputy quoted in here is not the sheriff so please don&rsquo;t assume that is the sheriff&rsquo;s stand on the issue.  I don&rsquo;t know what the sheriff&rsquo;s stand is on the issue.  I do not oppose immigration as this is what the country is based, however, I do think it should be done legally.  Breaking the law is breaking the law.  In 1980, the government gave amnesty for illegals and now look at our sitatuion.  The government raises this issue then slowly it is covered up again.  Does this make sense?  One thing for sure, I am glad I don&rsquo;t live in Noel anymore!!!</p>
