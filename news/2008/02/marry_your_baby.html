<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0214/p20s01-ussc.html">Marry Your Baby Daddy Day: Activist Marries Unwed Parents</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrea Appleton, Christian Science Monitor, February 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Maryann] Reid, 31 and single, dreams of wedding bells. But not just for herself. She wishes they jangled more for her peers in the African-American community, where the marriage rate is 36 percent and 70 percent of children are born out of wedlock.</p>
<p>Statistics like these are what convinced Reid to take matters into her own hands: She has christened Sept. 27 &#8220;Marry Your Baby Daddy Day.&#8221; An act of grass-roots social engineering, her effort to wed unmarried black couples who have children echoes efforts &mdash; by government, churches, and social welfare groups &mdash; to strengthen the institution of marriage.</p>
<p>The first Marry Your Baby Daddy Day, in 2005, was marked by an all-expenses-paid wedding at the House of the Lord Church in Brooklyn for 10 black couples with children. Ten more walked down the aisle at Manhattan&rsquo;s Riverside Church last September .</p>
<p>For each ceremony, Reid convinced dozens of local businesses to donate goods and services &mdash; such as designer dresses, bouquets, wedding cakes &mdash; $90,000 worth for the first mass wedding, and $125,000 for the second.</p>
<p>Reid hasn&rsquo;t earned a dime from the enterprise, but she claims she seeks something more intangible. &#8220;I want to go back to what African-Americans were known as,&#8221; she says, citing the decline of marriage among blacks, a trend that scholars attribute to factors ranging from the legacy of slavery to rising incarceration rates among black men. &#8220;They have historically been a married people. But now we don&rsquo;t have any family structure in our community at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>ooo</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reid and a volunteer wedding planner chose 10 couples from the New York area, following an interview process that included home visits in which they looked for evidence of a strong family life: orderly homes with personal space for the children, family photos on the wall, warm interactions between family members.</p>
<p>Reid has an unusual set of criteria for choosing her couples: They must have a proven track record of stability (some relationships go back 15 years) and they must already have children and live together. In short, they must have all the attributes of a good marriage, sans vows.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ooo</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Linda Malone-Colon, former director of the National Healthy Marriage Resource Center and an expert in black marital relationships, is troubled by some aspects of the enterprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that when people live together before marrying they&rsquo;re twice as likely to get divorced when they do marry,&#8221; she says, citing numerous studies. &#8220;I think we should be careful about tacitly encouraging cohabitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while the Rev. J. Lee Hill Jr., the Baptist minister who performed the 2007 Marry Your Baby Daddy Day wedding at Riverside Church in Manhattan, says he doesn&rsquo;t condone cohabitation before marriage either, he is supportive of Reid&rsquo;s project. &#8220;My hope and dream is that [these couples] will continue to stay in their relationship, and that this will be an encouragement for them to live their lives more in sync with biblical injunctions,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>For her part, Reid is pragmatic. &#8220;If you have children,&#8221; she says, &#8220;you should be living together to raise the child. That&rsquo;s the first sign to me that a couple has made a commitment.&#8221; So far, all 20 of Reid&rsquo;s couples remain married.</p>
