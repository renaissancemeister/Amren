						<p>Cologne, Germany &mdash; A crowd of 16,000 expatriate Turks cheered Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan at a vast indoor auditorium in Germany on Sunday as he told them to resist assimilation into the West.</p>
<p>The political rally by Germany&rsquo;s biggest ethnic minority upset German politicians, who objected to a major public event on German soil being advertised on posters in Turkish only.</p>
<p>Erdogan indirectly addressed those concerns, saying it was right for Turkish immigrants to learn German and other languages so they could integrate, but wrong to abandon their Turkish heritage and assimilate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Assimilation is a crime against humanity,&#8221; he told the crowd. Many Turks had travelled from France, Belgium and the Netherlands to hear his hour-long address in the shiny venue, the Koelnarena.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can well understand that you are against assimilation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is important to learn German, but your Turkish language should not be neglected.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said ethnic Turks abroad should be more confident in standing up for their interests, and should win election as mayors and members of European national parliaments.</p>
<p>The prime minister called for a swift inquiry to find the causes of a fire a week ago that killed nine Turkish people in the German city of Ludwigshafen.</p>
<p>Erdogan was lionized by other speakers at the event, organized by the Union of European Turkish Democrats, a group that supports his moderate Islamist AKP party.</p>
<p>Outside, bearded members of the audience spoke politely to an elderly woman protester, Vera Villinger, who wore a scarf in German colours and claimed Islam was taking over Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come along and spoken openly of your concerns. In itself that is exemplary,&#8221; one man told her.</p>
<p>The only hostility was towards a group of Kurdish protesters, who were ringed by police. The fuming Kurds roared back abuse at a passer-by they took for a Turk. He was in fact a 24-year-old German.<br>

			<p>The reason Whites tolerate this kind of stuff is simple. Nobody pays any attention to the problems of the West. I talk to people about immigration here in America all the time and I am always shocked at how litte they know about the problems facing Whites today. To understand the problems facing White-Christian America or Europe would requiring reading and research. That is simply too much work for most Whites or it&rsquo;s not &#8220;cool&#8221; enough to do.</p>

<p>And in the US it is Calderon who says exactly the same thing to Mexicans in this country.</p>
<p>And both leaders have done no less than commit an act of war against their neighbors for which an overwhelming unilateral attack on both their capitals in reprisal would be justified, but won&rsquo;t come about because the corrupt leaders of the West have lost their spines in their mad attempts at enriching themselves by any means possible.</p>
<p>To them seditious elements are not threats to national security, they are tax producing units and consumers.  Press 1 for Spanish.  Press 2 for Turkish. <br>

<p><br>
That is correct, and I agree.  They most certainly should strive to preserve their Turkish language and culture   &mdash;  - IN TURKEY, where it belongs.</p>

- - - - - - - - - - - - -    <br>
It seems to me he&rsquo;s splitting hairs here.  Integration is virtually identical to assimilation. It&rsquo;s the first step anyway. And if assimilation is a &#8220;crime against humanity&#8221;, then that&rsquo;s what the USA had always expected of its immigrants right up to 1965.  I don&rsquo;t see that their descendents have suffered any ill effects from it.  They&rsquo;re Americans today because of it.</p>
<p>But another point:  When it comes to VERY different peoples and cultures, we really shouldn&rsquo;t want them to assimilate (if that&rsquo;s even possible) because that will inevitably change us as much as it will change them.  The best thing for them, perferable to assimilation, is to go home.  It&rsquo;s best for all of us.  THEY don&rsquo;t want it, and WE don&rsquo;t want it either.   There&rsquo;s only the globalist, internationalist, Marxist element who have an agenda who are pushing for it, and they&rsquo;re determined to force it on all the rest of us.</p>

			<p>As much as there is every reason for Germans to despise this Turkish minister and to be against unassimilated immigrants, but to his credit, he speaks out exactly what the majority of Turks think about themselves in Germany: No assimilation desired, instead Turkish schools, Turkish shops, Turkish broadcasts - in other words, the Turkish colonization of Germany. His speech put much salt into the soup liberals and multiculturalists are spooning. I&rsquo;m asking myself what further kind of proof Germans and whites in General need to be exposed to in order to realize that multiculturalism has failed&hellip;  If even a direct message from representatives of countries of immigrants doesn&rsquo;t wake them up&hellip;  What will?<br>
Anyway, thank you Mr. Erdogan for telling the truth, for confirming what we &#8220;rights&#8221; have been always saying, and for screwing up liberal&rsquo;s pink eyeglasses&hellip;  That will only be a benefit for us.</p>

			<p>It appears that Turkey is now playing the same destabilizing role with the Turks in Germany as Mexico is playing with the Mexicans in the United States.</p>
<p>And the United States is pushing the EU to bring Turkey in as a full member so the Islamification of Europe can get into high gear!?!?  It is so obvious that the neo-con&rsquo;s goal is to wipe out Western Civilization, Judeo-Christianity, and the white race.   </p>
<p>There was an article in last Sunday&rsquo;s Washington Post stating that the neo-cons were not really liberal in their origins, but rather sprang from the Trotskyites.  Why am I not surprised??  </p>

<p>The most disturbing thing about this story is the manner in which it&rsquo;s reported.  Erdogan&rsquo;s party is a &#8220;moderate&#8221; party, but Le Pen in France is invariably described as &#8220;far right&#8221; or extremist.  The Kurds are mocked and marginalized, as if their concerns were irrelevant.  The Turks are portaryed as wanting to engage in constructive dialogue with the Germans when what they want is an Islamic Germany, an Islamic Europe.</p>
<p>The MSM is a much more dangerous enemy than Islam itself, for it makes open discussion impossible.</p>

			<p>French President Charles de Gaulle, on a visit to Canada in 1967, uttered the words, &#8220;Vive Quebec Libre&#8221; (long live free Quebec).</p>
<p>This was considered an extremely serious breach of diplomatic protocol, as it was seen to suggest the people of Quebec were under occupation by Canada.</p>
<p>Canadians were outraged at the implied threat to Canada&rsquo;s territorial integrity and took the words to be an insult to the thousands of Canadians who had fought and died on the battlefields of France during two World Wars. The Canadian media harshly criticized the statement, and the Prime Minister of Canada, Lester B. Pearson, a World War I veteran and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, stated that &#8220;Canadians do not need to be liberated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of the uproar, De Gaulle cut short his visit and quickly returned to France.</p>
<p>Where is the German outrage at this provocation by the Turk?  Show them weakness and it will stimulate Turkish aggression. He should have been declared &#8216;persona non-grata&rsquo; and sent home.</p>

From 1967 to 2008.  What a difference 41 years have made.  This shows how softened up and weakened the West has become in that time, doesn&rsquo;t it?  When will a Pakistani Prime Minister visit Canada and demand autonomy for the Pakistani enclave there?  Just a matter to time.</p>

I just can&rsquo;t get over it.  A patriot who says France should be for the French is denounced and scorned as a far right extremist! Meanwhile, a Turk who comes into a European country and tells his implanted colony there to resist assimilation is caled a &#8220;moderate&#8221;.   </p>
<p>This tells us something about where the newsmedia stand on these matters.  A patriot is a traitor, and a traitor is a hero.   Huh?  Orwellian doublespeak!  Orwell wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it.  Surely  he thought he was writing fiction.</p>

			<p>I see his comment as a good thing, I don&rsquo;t want them to assimilate, I don&rsquo;t want miscegenation between the races.  The more these Turks reject Germany, the less likely, I hope, that Turkey will be permitted to enter the EU.  I pray that increased radicalization of these Turks will only serve to damage the liberal agenda.</p>

			<p>the corrupt leaders of the West have lost their spines in their mad attempts at enriching themselves by any means possible.</p>
<p>Posted by Robert Kelly at 6:45 PM on February 11 </p>
<p>Yes Robert, no doubt.  But I would add a clarification.  That these sell-out &#8220;leaders&#8221; were spineless BEFORE they reached positions of power.  In fact, they reached positions of power exactly because they were spinless.  The reason is because the Bosses of these spineless leaders, who George Carlin refered to as &#8220;The real owners of this Country&#8221;* put them there for window-dressing.</p>
<p>The role of the corrupt, spinless, Politician talking out of both sides of their mouth, is firmly entrenched in American Society, and Europe.  </p>
<p>It makes you wonder about the sanity of people who still rally around these guys every four years to actually elect one of them to sit in the Oval Office and, in doing what they are told by their Bosses, actively work to relegate the Worlds Greatest Idea (&#8220;Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness&#8221;) to the dustbin of History.</p>
<p>*I&rsquo;m aware of the spin Carlin later put on his own words when asked to elaborate on this point.  But that&rsquo;s of no account.  Everyone knew who he was refering to.</p>

			<p>The Turks here have reason on their side. The Germans do not. Were a Turk, I would not assimilate, and I would seriously consider the idea of a takeover of the entire country. in the longterm. After all, the Germans are showing a disgusting level of weakness - on their own turf. No-one respects weakness&hellip;&hellip; </p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s certainly a crime against Germany, and against Europe. <br>
It&rsquo;s designed to wipe them out as a nation and Europe as a race. Now, isn&rsquo;t that what&rsquo;s called &#8220;genocide&#8221;?</p>

<p>No coincidence.  The nonwhites are getting bolder.  Whenever they have large numbers into a white country they don&rsquo;t go back.  They know that they have the upper hand since once they get a few of their kind and their apologists in positions of authority they know that they have something good.  They know its irreversible so things won&rsquo;t change until some civil strife of some kind takes over to balance the natural order of things.  Ethnic groups can already hire their in own in the government offices, for example, and not be prosecuted for racial discrimination.  What&rsquo;s sad is that Europe is our ancestral homeland and its going under.</p>

			<p>I agree with Soviet Republic&rsquo;s comment: &#8220;America did a good job castrating the Germans after WWII. We wanted to make sure the Germans would never again start any wars and we sure did a good job.&#8221;  But it wasn&rsquo;t just America; it was also England. They punished Germany severely after WWI. Why? Because Germany came to the defense of Austria after Russia intervened for the Serbs. The severe punishment gave rise to Hitler and WWII. And then Germany was punished again - forever. This is unfortunate because Germany is the one major European country that would now stand up to the Muslim invasion if only their hands were not tied behind their backs; they are the one country with backbone. I am not so sure England even wants to win the battle against the Muslim invasion.  The country vigorously lobbied for Turkey&rsquo;s entry into the EU while fighting against Croatia&rsquo;s entry, a staunchly Christian country that Margaret Thatcher in her book &#8220;Statecraft&#8221; said is &#8220;more European in some ways than England&#8221;. Recently, their archbishop said England will eventually have to adopt sharia law. These are just a few examples. England is free to fight, but they are on the other side. Germany would fight, but are not allowed to fight. Russia, where there is a nationalistic movement underway, seems to be the only hope. </p>

<p>Further to your point, just as Russia inherited Germany&rsquo;s &#8220;enemy of the West&#8221; mantle after WWII, it seems as if the powers that be are circling Russia just as they did Germany pre-WWI.  Russia is the most racially-aware White nation on Earth, a natural threat to the globalist agenda.  &#8220;Punished forever&#8221; may be Russia&rsquo;s epitaph as well.</p>

Well, Mr. Jones,  didn&rsquo;t we have a massive &#8220;protest&#8221; over the Amnesty issue only quite recently?   Can you tell us what has collapsed among our &#8220;anti-white oppressive leaders&#8221;???  <br>
 <br>
They&rsquo;re all still at it, as far as I can see.   ALL!  And they&rsquo;re all still there.  It&rsquo;s just been placed on the back burner, for now that is.</p>
