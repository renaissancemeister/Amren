<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Two Muslim mothers have won a court appeal against a municipal pool in Gothenburg that required them to take off their veils and body-covering clothing.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal for western Sweden found the City of Gothenburg guilty of ethnic discrimination and ordered the authorities to pay the women 20,000 kronor ($3,000) each in damages.</p>
<p>The women, Houda Morabet and Hayal Eroglu, were at the pool separately on two different occasions in April 2004, accompanying their young children but not to swim themselves.</p>
<p>Both were wearing veils, long pants and long-sleeved tee-shirts because their religion does not allow them to reveal parts of their body in public.</p>
<p>In its judgment, the court said that the actions of the swimming pool lifeguards, who insisted that the women should change into tee-shirts, could be deemed discriminatory even if this had not been their intention.</p>
<p>The nature of Sweden&rsquo;s discrimination laws mean that it was up to the City of Gothenburg to prove that the request for the women to remove some of their clothing had nothing to do with their religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the view of the Court of Appeal, the City of Gothenburg did not succeed in doing this,&#8221; the court said in a statement.</p>
<p>In March last year, Gothenburg District Court ruled that the municipal pool had not discriminated against the women.</p>
<p>It ordered the Ombudsman against Ethnic Discrimination, which had brought the case on their behalf, to pay the City of Gothenburg&rsquo;s costs of 30,850 kronor ($4,720 dollars).</p>
<p>The lifeguards testified that although there was nothing in the security regulations about veils, the rules did require people in the pool area to wear shorts and tee-shirts, even if they don&rsquo;t plan to swim.</p>
<p>The mothers&rsquo; cumbersome clothing would have prevented them from coming to the rescue of their children if necessary, they argued.</p>

			<p>I am sitting back, interested to see if and when Sweden will recognize its foolishness and end this idiocy of trying to absorb Arabs, Muslims and everyother non-Swedish racial and cultural group into the liberal Sweden that has inspired them to bring them all in.  They don&rsquo;t want liberal Sweden, they just want to take over the country with their own cultures.</p>

			<p>Well, they expect us to act like Muslims in their native lands, so why can&rsquo;t white Swedes expect the same?</p>

			<p>This is a proper decision.  </p>
<p>People here need to realize that if the immigrants are going to stay then the best way to deal is through moderate multiculturalism.  The immigrants must be allowed to dress how they want.  Otherwise they will become alienated and their children will be angry at their host society.  </p>
<p>Deporting everyone is your pipe dream.  Moderate multiculturalism is the best hope for assimilation.    </p>

			<p>From a purely legal/legislative standpoint, they probably have a good case. Don&rsquo;t invite all manner foreign and alien peoples into your midst, and then complain when they behave in an alien fashion. This is the folly and corrosive foolishness of multiculturalism and pluralism on parade. This is what so many who mouth praise for &#8220;Diversity&#8221; and all that comes with it fail utterly to understand - and then it is they who are often quick to complain when the &#8220;diverse&#8221; start flexing their ethno-cultural muscle!  </p>

			<p>And yet, they expect Swedes to behave like Muslims, in their own country.</p>

			<p>well, in this case I think they are rigth- they are not capable of acting like swedes&hellip;but I would add..therefore, they shouldn&rsquo;t be in Sweden</p>

			<p>Sounds like a bit of a silly rule to me - surely if the kids were to get in any trouble the lifeguards would have been at hand to help out. Its not like these women were going for a swim with their Islamic gear on.</p>
<p>All the same however it does mean the principle of one rule for all becomes moot when dealing with Muslims. And I feel sorry for Sweden. Sweden has never invaded, exploited or colonised non-whites. They graciously allows refugees and all manner of flotsam and jetsam into their previously pristine country, and then these beneficiaries of the generosity of the Swedish people turn round and demand special treatment. Incredibly arrogant and rude. The Swedes should boot out those who will not abide by Swedish rules and standards and close their borders to any further Islamist riff raff.</p>

			<p>Perhaps the post by &#8220;O the road to Mandalay&#8221; [sic] was some kind of attempted satire, but I frankly doubt it.</p>
<p>The epithet &#8220;moderate&#8221; can no more be applied to &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; than it can to, for example, &#8220;Muslim&#8221;. Multiculturalism is a radically misconceived doctrine from the very start that will inevitably wreak havoc in any society where its writ runs. (Indeed, &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; as an ideology is in Europe invariably a proxy - a Trojan horse, if you will - for Islamisation.) </p>
<p>&#8220;Mandalay&#8221; would do well to read the articles and posts on American Renaissance passim, where this point will be borne in on him or her ineluctably. </p>

I&rsquo;ll agree with that. However, if you&rsquo;re in Sweden (or anyplace) you&rsquo;re under an obligation to comply with the rules and not defy them. That would apply to me just as well   &mdash;    and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>I do have to sympathize with the lifeguards in this matter.  They were in an impossible situation.  They had a set of rules to enforce, and if they didn&rsquo;t they could have been reprimanded. Then they would have been the ones in trouble.</p>
<p>As for the two women, they each came out $3,000. ahead.  That&rsquo;s nice change, much better than they could ever make in Turkey. by plain work.</p>
<p>PS. I also wondered if Mandalay was writing &#8220;some kind of attempted satire.&#8221;   If so, I didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>

			<p>M&rsquo;d did not swim.. lack of water in the desert. Very few muslims swim because it would be an insult to islam. If muslim kids drown because their mothers can&rsquo;t save them.. so what?? Perhaps the lifeguards didn&rsquo;t notice or all dived into the other end of the pool to rescue someone else. There is always a way.</p>

			<p>Virtually all public pools require showering before entering the pool.  In fact, some American states have formal laws or quasi-legislative bureaucratic legislation that one must take a &#8220;nude soap shower&#8221; before swimming.  I&rsquo;m just waiting for the first conflict between Muslims and these laws.</p>
