<p>Some who favor restrictions on immigration will accept all this. &#8220;Yes, the history is evil,&#8221; they admit, &#8220;but an economy cannot function without controls on immigration. So for everyone&rsquo;s good, we must uphold the laws, whatever happened in the past.&#8221; Again, let&rsquo;s consider this argument with a clear view of the actual social function of immigration policy. The U.S. economy has always profited from cheap labor. From &#8220;subhuman&#8221; African slaves laboring in plantations, to Irish &#8220;trash&#8221; dying in mines and factories, to &#8220;Chinese devils&#8221; building railroads, to the migrant farmworkers, hotel maids and nannies for the wealthy of today, it has always been convenient for capitalists to have at their disposal a desperate and insecure work-force, if only to undercut more organized elements.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is the ugly reality behind talk of &#8220;immigration reform.&#8221; Like so much, this reality is obvious to much of the world, but white America hides its eyes, chattering on about the rule of law, as if history and economics do not exist. We white Americans live in a land conquered through genocide and war. We Hoyas attend a university built on indigenous land by slave-owning European priests. Some of us descend from the original murderers and thieves; some came later, perhaps as last century&rsquo;s hated immigrant. Some of us worked for what we have, and some had it handed to them. But in every instance, our opportunities and life exist within an economy that controls the hemisphere and exploits workers, legal and illegal, here and in other countries. Our wealth &mdash; all wealth in this nation &mdash; was built on the backs of slaves and despised immigrants, using stolen land.</p>
<p>If you can face that honestly, you are in a position to begin thinking honestly about the issue of immigration. What counts as fair treatment of someone who lost their job in a U.S.-owned maquiladora, perhaps for daring to talk about unions, after working 15-hour days for a fraction of our minimum wage? If you first face your own history, you can decide whether to scorn such people for sneaking into California to scrub toilets so as to feed their children. You can decide whether to deny them health care.</p>
<p>Perhaps, after facing reality, you will decide that someone else altogether should be making such policy decisions. For myself, I dream of a council of elders from the remaining indigenous peoples of the Americas formulating a hemispheric policy on immigration. And I dream that white people would, for once, shut the **** up and accept it.</p>
<p>But that, of course, is merely a dream. And while I don&rsquo;t really suppose it is more than that, I do have a message for my white brothers and sisters: no more debate as if history does not exist. No more blind, willful ignorance. Face reality first, and then tell me how immigrants to this land deserve to be treated.</p>

<p>Another ignorant, illiterate sophomore who feels, somehow, that determining what others must &#8220;face&#8221; and believe before expressing opinions lies within his competence and authority. Where does this mindset (a phrase I use advisedly) come from? Who fills the empty heads of these little dears with such absurd vanity?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;For myself, I dream of a council of elders from the remaining indigenous peoples of the Americas formulating a hemispheric policy on immigration. And I dream that white people would, for once, shut the **** up and accept it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another depressing sign of the times that Georgetown University, once among the finest universities in the country, admits &#8220;students&#8221; who think and write like this. But Mr. Lance should take heart; in a decade or two, if present trends continue, he&rsquo;ll get exactly the kind of government he thinks he wants.</p>

			<p>I do not agree with Mr. Lance, but he is certainly entitled to his own opinion. Besides, to argue with his &#8220;facts&#8221; would be pointless and a waste of time. But if he really believes what he is saying than he should move back to Europe where his &#8220;evil&#8221; and &#8220;genocidal&#8221; White ancestors came from. That&rsquo;s right Mr. Lance, give all of your possesions to a &#8220;native&#8221; American, apologize to him/her for the actions of your ancestors and move back to Europe. </p>

<p><br>
I&rsquo;m willing to wager I know a lot more about history than you, college boy. And after many years of study and a great deal of contemplation, yes, I do scorn these people for sneaking into America   &mdash;   whether it&rsquo;s to scrub toilets, to smuggle drugs, to wage Reconquista, or for ANY OTHER REASON. They don&rsquo;t fit in, they don&rsquo;t learn English, they breed like flies, and they are quite simply WRECKING the place. </p>
<p>If these mestizos can&rsquo;t feed their children in their own country, maybe they should try this miraculous new invention called the condom. </p>
<p>And you, self-hating white college boy, can shut the **** up and accept it.<br>

			<p>You have to be very well off to go to Georgetown, especially if you happen to be white.  I imagine the author of this piece has led a very comfortable, privileged life.  I wonder how he will feel about giving these illegals &#8220;health care&#8221; when the hospital that Daddy is the Chief Surgeon for goes insolvent.  He goes on to say Georgetown was founded by &#8220;slave owning murderous priests and thieves&#8221;.  Fine, tear it down and turn it into a museum dedicated to slaves and indians.  Keep all the money that these rich socialists have endowed and force their kids out into the workforce to compete with the illegals that they love.</p>

			<p>Illegal aliens are just scab labor.  No matter how you cut it, they are brought here to drive our wages down and drive us into poverty.   Any Mexican who talks about how Americans owe him a job when his sole function is to drive us into poverty isn&rsquo;t worth a hearing.</p>
<p>And as far as those moron bruthas and sistas are concerned, in particular, the ones that &#8220;vote Mexican&#8221; and want us to legalize all the little mojados and pendejos, well they can pay for their own affirmative action, and they can hire their own cops to protect their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>There just aren&rsquo;t enough white folks to carry them any more   &mdash;   particularly if they keep inviting mojados into our country.</p>

I think the indigenous people of the Americas should face up to their own history.Remember the human sacrifice scene from Apocalypto.It gives a new meaning to the phrase &#8220;YOU EAT MY HEART OUT&#8221;.And remember the last scene when the Spanish ship arrived who eventually put an end to such evil lunacy such as Huamn sacrifice in the americas.</p>

			<p>Finally, in the last year or so, the views of the majority of the citizenry get a little notice, enough to frighten the scoundrels McCain, Huckabee, and Romney, so the voice of oppression calls out from Georgetown University to tell us we have no right to speak.  The ruling class has had its say and its way for decades, so when the people speak truth to power, the intellectuals summon their strongest argument:&#8221;Shut up!&#8221;    <br>
    One of the things most to be hoped for in the event of a real economic collapse, is the closing of the universities.  Other than engineering, medical, and science grads, what does it benefit the nation to have these cesspits of privilege?  </p>

<p>Oh, here we go again, another &#8220;white guilt trip.&#8221; Mr.Lance, if you look at  history on the entire planet, it is one of past wars, conquests,injustices,brutality and slavery. The instances occured everywhere and among ALL races. Stop the hypocrisy. Whites in the past were no worse than any other race. This has NOTHING to do with people today or  the type of migration we have today. If so, can we blame african-americans for the fact that africans sold their own people into slavery? Can we blame muslims today for the fact that they were FIRST in the african slave trade. Face fact, mexicans have no right to illegally invade our country and traitor americans have no right to hire them or allow them too. Most americans want legal immigration severely restricted too and the american citizens have the right to make these decisions, not marxists like you who foist your views against our will or the elite globalists who also foist it on us against our will. This is OUR home and we want the doors shut.</p>

<p>White people are not going to shut up.  White people are not going to accept it.  People of color are are incapable or unwilling to build and function in a civilized society.  However, White people are waking up to how much damage the third-world invasion is damaging our country.  White peoples&rsquo; tax dollars are paying for your crime, your disease, and your unending breeding. </p>

			<p>This clap-trap about the economy and cheap-labor, are the weakest of all arguments in favor of unfettered immigration. First of all, the idea that America&rsquo;s wealth is predicated upon massive numbers of slaves, or later Hispanic laborers is preposterous. One should do a little homework and look to the economic issues behind the Civil War. It was the slave-holding South that was financially strapped, while the ever more industrialized North was booming. The Southern aristocracy may have had big money in slaves, but for the South as a region, a people, slavery was a burden(in more ways than one of course) and would no doubt have been cast aside, regardless of the outcome of the war! </p>
<p>White countries do not rely upon black and brown people to generate wealth, as nations. Some businesses may, but the nations do not. What of Norway or Iceland? The highest standards of living on earth, with no non-whites needed to amass their wealth. Indeed, adding non-whites is only strain and strife, as Scandinavians are finding out the hard way!  </p>

<p>We acquired this land fair and square El Retardo, and it was built by us 100%.  </p>
<p>Is this jerk too dense to understand that the &#8220;indigenous&#8221; people don&rsquo;t want land for the sake of owning more land, because they have thousands of square miles of it at their disposal lying vacant and unused?  They want the civilization that sits on the land that the white man built, of course, plain and simple.</p>

			<p>Mr. Lance&rsquo;s parents paid $200K for his alleged education at an alleged Catholic school.  Why do Whites drink the coolaid?  How is this kid&rsquo;s travail at Georgetown any different than if he went to Guyana with Jim Jones in &#8216;78?  We are committing suicide, and feeling damn self righteous about it.  How can a people that produced the culture and technology we have successfully be taught to hate themselves?</p>

<p>Indeed Comrade Lance, I will not forget history or indulge in an arrogant ignorance, that holds that &ldquo;educated&rdquo; intolerance from Red swine in Ivory Towers, is the same as being &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo;  in the ways of the real world and its history!</p>
<p>History shows first, that fools living in prosperity and comfort, that refuse to defend themselves or their own, are destroyed by invaders. Second, history also shows, that invaders unlike immigrants, have no loyalty or respect for the people and country they are infesting as opposed to joining. </p>
<p>Even using your logic, stripped it of all the sanctimonious Neo Marxist sewage, if the USA is a country that: </p>
<p>&ldquo;We white Americans live in a land conquered through genocide and war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are all the more obligated to both defend and preserve it through the same, for future generations of white Americans, and not the people who our ancestors battled and defeated. They after all, for all of your self-hating denials and recriminations, would be the ones who would sit on a &ldquo;council of elders&rdquo; of &ldquo;indigenous peoples.&rdquo; That would be because, we are now the indigenous peoples of this land, as is our culture now too indigenous.</p>
<p>I for one dream, that such a &ldquo;council of elders&rdquo; would tell spoiled and &ldquo;educated&rdquo; white multiculturalists to &ldquo;shut the **** up and accept,&rdquo; the fact that &ldquo;two Wongs don&rsquo;t make a white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>There are ONLY four things in this world&hellip;.land, women, treasure and respect. All men want these things and there is not enough for all men to have as much as they want, so men are rivals. Most men are born without any of these things and must acquire them from OTHER men in the course of their lives. In primative times, these things were won by the sword. More modern men, acquire what they want by trade. No matter how these things are won, men hold what they have against all other men. You can only have what you can keep from other men. Should your grip loosen, you will soon lose what you have to others. You have what you can keep.</p>
<p>Now the primatives have invaded our land and while they pretend to trade, they are only slightly restrained from taking what they want by force. Sometimes they resort to force and we must prepare for the time when modern man must use superior force to keep what he has from the invaders. While we did not use force to acquire what we have and we would not use force in rivalry with other modern men, we will lose all we have if we refuse to use the sword to keep primatives from taking what we intend to keep. We keep it not only for ourselves and for the safety of our families, we keep it also for our own sons. </p>
<p>I am my father&rsquo;s son, just as he was his father&rsquo;s son. The blood of my ancestors runs in my veins and the memory of all that they accomplished inspires me to rise up against lesser men, for the primatives will not take what my fathers have made for me and they will not take what I intend for my sons or my grandsons. The invader has a country and he needs to be in his own country, rather than trying to take my country from me.</p>
<p>Has it ever been any different?<br>

			<p>It is difficult to know what to make of these truly self-hating leftist types.  This guy hates his country so much that he sees ANY immigration policy as bad: if it&rsquo;s restrictionist, it&rsquo;s evidence of racism; if it&rsquo;s open borders, it&rsquo;s evil capitalists exploiting cheap labor.  </p>
<p>Ironically, his solution to the problem, whether he realizes it or not, is the same type of race-based oligarchy he perceives America to be: a council of Indian elders rather than a white capitalist elite, but apparently without even the pretense of democracy.  In other words, a rather conventional leftist totalitarian fantasy. </p>

			<p>The ugly freaking reality of it is they are TRESPASSERS, INVADERS who have made the decision to flaunt our laws, and as such, we cannot TRUST them to be otherwise law abiding, assimilating, AMERICANS. They consider themselves to be MEXICANS.<br>
Forget the fact that our wonderful government has criminally fallen down on one of it&rsquo;s main functions, that is, the security of the borders. The PEOPLE, by overwhelming majority, want ILLEGAL immigration stopped (at least), and the lawbreakers shipped back from whence they came.<br>
They should go BACK to Mexico, with an assist (a boot in the rear, my thinking) if necessary, but definitely BACK.<br>
What is it about this plain, simple, THEY ARE HERE ILLEGALLY, breaking our laws notion that these bleeding @$$ Liberals don&rsquo;t understand?</p>

			<p>Barely a day passes without further evidence of the profound wisdom of whites in pre &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; south. Mixing different races produces garbage like Mark Lance. Is he referring to &#8220;indigenous people&#8221; such as the Aztecs who murdered more humans being per day than the Nazis.Is that who should make policy? This &#8220;student&#8221; is obviously pathological in his hatred of whites (males) who have invented or created 99.9% of everything of value including the University he attends. If the &#8220;indigenous people&#8221; were so wise why were they barely out of the stone age when the great Christopher Columbus introduced civilization to the Western Hemisphere?</p>

			<p>  Interesting is that these people will often rhapzosdize about all the glorius benefits of immigration but hardly ever of significant numbers in their neighborhood. Anyone can work with a certain group of people w/o wanting to work, live, or love with them. I work with mentally retarded/autistic/pyschotic individuals every day. Does that mean I want to live with my residents?</p>

			<p>I wish that for once the Mark Lance types would shut the &hellip;. up and understand that they are making contemporary value judgements on historical events. If he could point me to one place in the world where the evils he mentioned were not perpetrated at one time or another I would reevaluate my views on history. Most nations, including this one, now live in crowded but ordered societies and have immigration laws for those reasons.</p>

			<p>More marxist garbage! My ancestors came here over 400 years ago. They were some of the first land owners of Manhattan and New jersey! They worked them selves to the bone to make a legacy for their progeny! When they came here it was not on some 747 and they did not walk here over a 50 ft wide river! They fought indians, cleared land and planted crops! They hunted game and went to war, every war that has been fought on or by this nation for 400 years! They were not emigrants but conquerors and discoverers! This CLOWN hoya has no idea what he is talking about, only what small amount of socialist teaching his little mind can retain! Perhaps he would rather be planting corn instead of attending a university that his enemies have created? Just another hypocritical idiot!</p>

			<p>I think this man misses several points. </p>
<p>Firstly, U.S. citizenship is not based on race. And many Whites were forced here (even as slaves), and many non-Whites came here to &#8220;exploit the Indians&rsquo;s land.&#8221; So, White immigrants (including those from last year, even, are &#8220;guilty&#8221;) are guilty, but all non-Whites are &#8220;innocent?&#8221;</p>
<p>Does he also not realize that many Whites are part AmerIndian, and most Hispanics are part-White. At least the latter has ancestry from the present-day United States.</p>
<p>Does he actually believe that the (mostly part-White) Hispanics have as much claim to the U.S., as the AmerIndians? </p>
<p>He is also attacking us, for &#8220;not allowing a Mexican to sneak into California to scrub toilets so as to feed their children.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really about American interests (including survival). It may be cute to &#8220;Stick up&#8221; for, now. But these very same people may become the ones, who(indirectly, such as taking your job, etc.) prevent you from feeding your own children! </p>
<p>We are in the early stages of a major recession, and within 10 to 15 years, we may face depressions worse than the one from the 1930&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s not about &#8220;Compassion.&#8221; It&rsquo;s about survival, when your own kids&rsquo; lives could be at stake. By enforcing our own immigration laws (which we aren&rsquo;t), we are seeking our best interests over non-Citizens&rsquo;. </p>
<p>One last comment: So, it&rsquo;s okay to kill civilians (in wars), for National interest; but not enforce our own immigration laws, not allow lawbreakers into our country? If we must allow everybody in, our country will die. And what about those who applied legally, but were rejected (who would have become citizens, had they become illegal aliens). So we can kill, but can&rsquo;t defend ourselves? </p>

			<p>It is long past time to close most of these so called universities down and force the loafing, worthless, self hating punks who infest them to do the jobs the invaders were brought here to do. Hard, unremitting labor is the only way to make these cretins grow up and hopefully develop some self respect. Remember that false prosperity is one of the narcotics that is killing us. The hard times that are coming,I believe will force the shutdown of many institutions due to lack of money and just may turn out to be,long term,a blessing in disquise.</p>

			<p>Owe the illegals health care? They are going without necessisary treatment? It is the middle class people who are going without, especially if they do not have insurance for whatever reason. If a person is new on the job and the insurance is not in effect, if they are self employed or if they just choose to have the extra money and then medical attention they can face financial ruin. They make too much money on paper to qualify for medicaid and are just out of luck. An illegal can go to the ER and get the best that we offer for free since they can run out on the bill and the rest of us are left holding the bag. </p>

 Not exactly sir. They nurture and coddle and brainwash  these types AFTER they get there. I think the only thing the admission process has to do with all this is that they find people who are susceptable to this kind of drivel and then reign them in. A cult leader doesn`t admit  full fledged fellow cultists into the fold, he finds  weak minded people he can con into the belief system after they join. </p>

			<p>I can see the following scenario - McCain gives the prized &#8220;path to citizenship (one of the phrases that makes blood shoot from my eyes), so now they have to pay taxes and all the good stuff we as native Americans have to ante up. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; they will whine. &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;d have to pay anything. You&rsquo;ve been so good about the freebies so far. Is this a bait and switch operation? How can I send money home to my 150 closest relatives?&#8221; Well, that is a problem, isn&rsquo;t it, amigo? Welcome to the land of taxes and big, bad government. So, the marches begin again. It&rsquo;s 2020 and Teddy Kennedy is screaming, red-faced, &#8220;These people didn&rsquo;t ask for citizenship, why are we making them pay for being here? We must give them a free ride from birth to death.&#8221; Is that change, Senators McCain and Kennedy? I think not. it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve pushed all your liberal lives. Wake up, America!</p>

			<p>&#8220;If you first face your own history, you can decide whether to scorn such people for sneaking into California to scrub toilets so as to feed their children.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the Marxist cartoon version of history. As noted above, this could have been written by a sophomore or a professor. The level of scholarship in today&rsquo;s university makes it impossible to tell. They think their damning rhetoric strikes fear in the heart of white America but they are really just making fools of themselves.</p>
<p>And why do immigrants have to sneak into the U.S. to scrub toilets to feed their children? Because they come from a pathetic backward country that idiots like the author of this article would like to replicate here. Life scrubbing toilets in the U.S. is a step from a wretched society Mark Lance would make universal.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We white Americans live in a land conquered through genocide and war.  Our wealth &mdash; all wealth in this nation &mdash; was built on the backs of slaves and despised immigrants, using stolen land.&#8221;</p>
<p>All lands the world over throughout history were conquered and often reconquered repeatedly through warfare.  Warfare at the clan, tribal or national level if a fact of life born of the desire one group has to possess what another group owns. American has never known genocide because there are still Indians living among us today.  The only American industry built on the backs of slaves was the early southern cotton industry and that hardly qualifies as &#8220;all wealth in this nation&#8221;.  </p>

Why do we have to remain &#8216;silenced&rsquo; by the invading hordes. Show them compassion, but demand accountability and respect. Problem is he have allowed minorities to &#8216;control&rsquo; the dialog in the media and at the DOJ about such matters. The simple fact is, if every white person that cared about not being silenced boycotted CNN and picketed the DOJ, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in half the hot water we are now.</p>

<p>Look at the outrage here on this board! I do not agree with Lance but the responses here are rather telling. The ignorant responses on this board about who Lance is and the failure to even see the real message is embarrassing to the AmRen community. </p>
<p>Next time you post messages at least have some idea what you are talking about. Bombast isn&rsquo;t a constructive critique of his message. If you haven&rsquo;t analyzed his ideas then you really shouldn&rsquo;t bother posting about them now should you?</p>
<p>Anyone who posted about him being a student should never post on this board again. Baseless presumptions like that are one of the reasons communities like the one here at AmRen are marginalized.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Face reality first, and then tell me how immigrants to this land deserve to be treated.</p>
<p>Illegal or LEGAL immigrants? The writer is careful to duck this question. As to History. What&rsquo;s his point, if any? Darwin&rsquo;s Law: Survival of the Fittest, demonstrated by human conquest. Morrally wrong? Maybe. But like it or not, this has been part of human history since the last Ice Age and the passing of the Neanderthals who were replaced by modern Homo Sapiens.</p>
<p>I am &#8220;fed up&#8221; with well intentioned liberal fools trying to force an artificial guilt trip on me. Sure, Irish, Chinese and other immigrants labored hard and long. Again, so what? No one FORCED the Irish or the Chinese, the Italians, or the Eastern European immigrants to come here as lowly laborers. They came VOLUNTARILY&hellip; another point carefully ducked by the writer of this literary absurdity of an article. Uhlike our Mexican parasites, the earlier immigrants stood on their own feet. Not demanding, not expecting, and certainly NOT GETTING the welfare checks, the free healthcare, free schooling and other goodies we are handing the damned Mexican illegals on a silver platter.</p>
<p>That these same people prospered with the passage of time. That a man of Irish ancestry ascended to the Presidency of this country are points also overlooked in the article. As is the reality that all the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of these immigrants, with the glaring exception of so many of those descended from imported Black slaves   &mdash;   all advanced socially and economically, THROUGH THEIR OWN EFFORTS!</p>
<p>So just WHAT is Mark Lance really trying to say? That we White Americans should grovel before the hordes of illegal immigrants, swarming here and DEMANDING the right to sit and feed at OUR economic table? That we hardworking White Americans, many of us descended from those Irish, English, German Slavic, Scandinavian or Italian forbears are required to overlook the breeding excesses of these third-world primitives and support them and their progeny, in perpetuity?</p>
<p>The lying, weasely, meal-mouthed whores of politicians   &mdash;   Ted Kennedy, Amnesty McCain, Lying Hillary Clinton. Phony Obama and their ilk claim it &#8220;can&rsquo;t be done. We can&rsquo;t shove them out of our country.&#8221; I have news for them. Turn the American people loose if our government with all its resources can&rsquo;t do the job. We&rsquo;ll round the damned freeloading parasites up and shove them across the border. And we&rsquo;ll make damn well sure they stay on THEIR side of the border.</p>
<p>Human history is full of injustices. Each and every White Nation, every White ethnic group had its share of injustices over the eons of history. Yet that didn&rsquo;t give us the right to whine, beat our collective breasts in anguished lamentation. We advanced during the centuries, got our acts together and made something of ourselves. </p>
<p>The other races mentioned by Mark Lance had just as much opportunity over the last 50,000 years to advance. That they failed to match the social and economic achievements of Whites is tough beans, amigo! We all stood on a level playing field when modern man came on the stage roughly 50,000 to 60,000 years ago. The Fittest (Darwinism) doing better than the less fittest, who were simply lagging behind.</p>

<p>You are entitled to what views you care to hold&hellip; about us &#8220;racist&#8221; in your eyes AmRen readers, or the garbage espoused in your article. As to your; &#8220;of course you&rsquo;ll simply dismiss me now as a tenured radical commie&#8221; permit me to suggest both your rant and your article would certainly reinforce that perception some of us might hold.</p>
<p>Permit me one question, Mr. Lane, and do be good enough to respond:</p>
<p>WHAT ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? Or is the concept of a government RESPONSIVE TO and controlled by the collective will of the American voters as antiquated and archaic as the idea of commuting to our jobs via a horse and buggy?</p>
<p>Let the issue of amnesty for illegal immigrants or their innediate deportation be put on the ballot, I&rsquo;d safely guess the majority of Americans would favor deportation.</p>
<p>No, NOT out of anti-Hispanic racism, Mr. Lance, but because We, the People, have to put up with the cost of immigration   &mdash;   be it in wasted tax money, in the crime, the diseases, and the social problems the animalistic lifestyle of Hispanics bring us.</p>
<p>You might consider that the ONLY BENEFICIARIES of immigration are the greedy corporationa and greedy small business owners who garner fat profits by replacing American workers with cheap immigrant labor. </p>
<p>I most eagerly await your response, Mr. Lance</p>

			<p>&#8220;Now of course you&rsquo;ll simply dismiss me now as a tenured radical commie, but at least get the basic facts straight before launching into your name-calling denunciations. &#8220;</p>
<p>If you read all of the comments Mr.Lance, you&rsquo;d know that there is a lot of truth here regarding illegal immigration and the truth isn&rsquo;t &#8220;racist.&#8221; Racism isn&rsquo;t even a vaild term anymore, it&rsquo;s just used to shut people up from an honest debate. I live in a sancturary city. I have seen first hand the dramatic rise in crime, especially drunk driving deaths and sexual assualts committed by illegals. Our jails are full of them, our hospitals are overwhelmed with mexicans, so are our schools. Illegals cost my state(Texas) 5 billion a year in taxes. This is very much harmful to us and we have every right to not want it. It is wrong to take care of foreigners at the expense of your own citizens. </p>
<p>Two questions?-Illegal labor is just another modern day form of slavery, so are you for slavery?<br>
If I break into your house Mr.Lance because I want a better life, will you let me stay at your expense?</p>

			<p>re:Mark Lance-All we want is the same enforcement of immigration that non-white countries have. Mexico allows little legal immigration and doesn&rsquo;t tolerate illegal immigration, neith does almost any other non-white country. We want to do the same, so how is that racist? Also, as others have pointed out, people of all races have committed horrors in past history and slavery occurred all over the globe, so by your logic, people of all races should all illegal migration.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love the presumptuousness, ie; That Whites are all the same, share the same guilt.  Geez, he even mentions the Irish (my Mothers country).  We do wear green on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, but for the rest of the year we&rsquo;re as White as they get.</p>
<p>But also, the presumptuousness that he&rsquo;s right.  He knows all.  There is nothing for him to learn. His word is the final word.</p>
<p>And where does this outrageous self-confidence come from?</p>
<p>Well, because he himself is a deposit of one aspect of White, predominantly Middle Class culture of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Arrogant AND Ignorant<br>
Spoiled  AND Resentful<br>
Brutal   AND Stupid<br>
Sanctimonious AND Indifferent</p>
<p>How do we know this? We know this because people like him can&rsquo;t shut his f***ing mouth.</p>
<p>The real motivation for his Sophmoric screed is so he can justify his inability to get through those pesky, intellectually demanding masterpieces written by some of his Brothers and Sisters.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s a boy.  He&rsquo;s a sohpmore in college for crying out loud.  He&rsquo;s playing a role - Savior, and upscale know-it-all.  He hasn&rsquo;t even begun to seperate his Self from the Role he&rsquo;s playing.  And the reason why is that, being a boy, he still has no Self to define.</p>
<p>And the Role he&rsquo;s playing?  </p>
<p>People-pleaser.</p>
<p>Lot a good it will do him.</p>
<p>But rest assured &#8220;Brothers and Sisters&#8221; at AR.  The people he longs to please will take a paticular pleasure in letting him know the extent to which he&rsquo;s wasting him time.</p>

			<p>Professor Lance is simply being realistic.  &#8220;Liberalism&#8221; is simply not up to the task of destroying civilization any more.  The ideas and actions of liberals are so contradictory that no serious person can defend both.  Freedom of speech is a paramount value for liberalism, yet they impose speech codes and blacklist opponents.  The rights of individuals are sacrosanct, but they have established the principle of collective, inherited guilt through their affirmative action schemes.  They have decided that the U.S. is not a normal nation, a people with a common culture and history, but a &#8220;proposition nation&#8221;, rooted entirely in certain abstract principles, and then they import people, Moslems, Hindus, and others, who despise those principles.  And they will never, themselves, bear the costs of their favored policies.  Engage an honest liberal in conversation on these things, and watch them squirm, grasp at pathetic excuses, feign ignorance, and, when you corner them, give up.  Liberalism has brought us to the edge of the cliff, but hasn&rsquo;t the strength to push us over.  This is where Professor Lance and his kind come in.  He hasn&rsquo;t any liberal principles to defend, so he cannot be cornered intellectually.  He has his hatred and his blood-and-soil anti-nationalism, which fits nicely with every stripe of minority antagonism for the dwindling White majority.  We may recognize his ignorance of history, but his views coincide nicely with the fables of Blacks and Mexicans, which is all that matters to him.  Our foes are steeling their nerves to exterminate us, to strike hard should any serious resistance to their overlordship develop.  Professor Lance is merely beating his chest and summoning his Orcs.</p>

			<p>Anyone who posted about him being a student should never post on this board again. Baseless presumptions like that are one of the reasons communities like the one here at AmRen are marginalized.</p>
<p>Posted by David Traywick at 3:43 PM on February 5 </p>
<p>Ok, ok&hellip;Keep your shirt on.</p>
<p>It would appear that I too gathered from the posts that he was a student.  My mistake, and that of the others here was innocent enough, and, as far as I can tell, still did not do anything to detract from my original post.  I may stand corrected about a particular in the story (his being a Professor and not a Student) but I still stand by what I said about him.</p>
<p>Also David, if an honest mistake is enough for them, and you, to rake us over the coals, then that says more about how desperate they are to look for &#8220;reasons&#8221; to exclude us from the &#8220;debate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Making mistakes is a part of life&rsquo;s imperfections.  When you make them you own up and move on.  Aside from that, who the hell are you to tell someone never to post here again just because they made a mistake?</p>
<p>Next, you say he wasn&rsquo;t being serious? So what are you saying? That he&rsquo;s being ironic?  If that&rsquo;s the case he shouldn&rsquo;t bother, in as much as a psuedo-intellectual trying to be ironic is like a stupid child playing with dynamite.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s back up a bit. If you&rsquo;re so much smarter, and better, than the rest of us, enlighten us with your wisdom.  You&rsquo;re not going to win anyone over by starting your post addressing us all as &#8220;fools&#8221;.  And if you&rsquo;re not interested in getting a point across, why are YOU posting here?  You got a lot of nerve David lecturing us on &#8220;Bombast&#8221;.</p>
<p>You also said, &#8220;He&rsquo;s turning the same argument we all use against us, quite effectively.&#8221;  </p>
<p>How so?  Am I missing something?  Would you care to explain?</p>
<p>Especially since in the very next paragraph you compliment the guy and then tell us you don&rsquo;t agree with him!</p>
<p>Are you him?</p>
<p>Honestly, your post did read like the kind I&rsquo;ve seen here from time to time.  The kind we see written by anti-White racists whose intellectual limitations keep you from satisfying your desire to tell us off and put us in our place. In the end your comments sound condescending, flat, and pretentious.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re what I call a tourist.  You come to our little town on the Internet so to speak, with no respect, filled with self-righteousness, and dismiss us all like a Shaming Parent.</p>
<p>You make yourself look silly David.  </p>
<p>But, far from wishing you away from here I encourage you to keep coming back. You can stay long enough to learn some manners.   </p>

			<p>This is the Know-Nothing IGNORANCE and RACIAL HATE and LIES that is being taught gullible children in our universities today (at OUR expense). THIS Leftwing extremist PROPAGANDA is what passes for &#8220;education&#8221; today. Just to address a couple of the idiocies:</p>
<p>&#8220;We white Americans live in a land conquered through genocide and war&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This often repeated line is a COMPLETE MYTH: There was NO &#8220;genocide&#8221; against Indians in this country. The number of Indians who were killed by whites in armed conflicts was on par with the number of whites killed by Indians. Far more Indians were killed by other Indians, both before and after the arrival of white migrants. There was NO policy of &#8220;genocide&#8221; by anyone. Many Indians died from disease, but this was NO ONE&rsquo;S fault. No one understood the nature of disease at that time. Europe&rsquo;s own population had been decimated by such plagues throughout its history.<br>
<a href="https://www.townhall.com/columnists/MichaelMedved/2007/09/19/reject_the_lie_of_white_genocide_against_native_americans" rel="nofollow">https://www.townhall.com/columnists/MichaelMedved/2007/09/19/reject_the_lie_of_white_genocide_against_native_americans</a></p>
<p>And how do these nuts think those Indians got their land: They should check out the history of conquest, massacres, genocides, enslavement, and stealing of land carried out by Indians long before the white man arrived. They should read up on the bloody history of the Aztec and Inca Empires, for example. They should study how invading tribes from what is today Mexico exterminated the Anastazi Indians of the Southwest, centuries before the arrival of the white man.<br>
(And the last time I checked, it was not just &#8220;whites&#8221; living and enjoying this prosperous land: But every other race too! Anyone who really believes this is &#8220;stolen&#8221; land should LEAVE: By enjoying and using &#8220;stolen goods&#8221; they are JUST AS GUILTY. They just let someone else do their dirty work. People like myself (part Chickasaw), with significant ancestry of a tribe native to what is today the U.S. can stay!)</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Our wealth &mdash; all wealth in this nation &mdash; was built on the backs of slaves&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time of the Civil War, blacks were only 14% of the population. Even in the South, there were more whites working the fields than blacks (95% of Southerners were poor dirt farmers who owned NO slaves). And of course, the Northerners, the bulk of the U.S. population, living where there were no slaves, weren&rsquo;t exactly sitting on their butts either. Yet these idiots would have you believe that this country was &#8220;built on the backs of slaves&#8221;! 14% of the population? Everyone else supposedly doing nothing but sitting back while 14% of the population did everything. Whatever was contributed by slaves was WIPED OUT, and many times over, by the Civil War WHICH LAID WASTE TO THE SOUTH. And in any case, the country only had 30 million people at that time, 1/10 of today&rsquo;s population, and a miniscule portion of the economic production of today. SLAVERY THAT ENDED 140 YEARS AGO HAS NO RESIDUAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE US WEALTH TODAY. If anything, it COST and did irreparable damage.<br>
Hundreds of thousands of young white men from the North died, the ultimate sacrifice, and many more maimed and mutilated in the bloodiest war this country ever fought, the Civil War, which freed the slaves.</p>
<p>Where the prosperity and wealth has ACTUALLY come from is the creative genius of many white men: <br>
The whites who developed the machinery that does 95% of the labor in the world (tractors, trucks, trains, planes, bulldozers, backhoes, automation, &hellip;).<br>
The whites who developed vaccines, antibiotics, hybridized crops (saving hundreds of millions, even billions, of lives).<br>
The whites who developed modern electronics (transistors, integrated circuits, computers, telephones,&hellip;).<br>
The whites who developed modern materials (plastics, steel, nylon, synthetic rubber,..).</p>
<p>This sophomoric parroting of the hate-whitey propaganda, which is this white child&rsquo;s way of parading his &ldquo;moral superiority&rdquo; and showing off how &ldquo;hip&rdquo; he is, almost giving himself an orgasm with spewing self-hatred (which would be OK if he&rsquo;d limit it to himself and not egg on hatred against the rest of us too), raises what should be alarm bells to any thinking person: What is the ESSENCE of &ldquo;racism&rdquo;?<br>
1.) Collective guilt<br>
2.) Advocacy of legalized privilege simply based on ancestry<br>
3.) Attacking one person or set of people based on what an entirely DIFFERENT person or set of people did or did not do. Even more so when those OTHER people are DEAD! If someone digs into the dead past, and uses things that allegedly happened between people long dead to attack different people today, THAT is RACISM.</p>
<p>His babbling encompasses all three of these hallmarks of TRUE RACISM.<br>

<p>You&rsquo;ll have to forgive people for assuming you were some sophomoric child&hellip;.because your writing, knowledge, and depth of thought are at that level. Many who went to college when there were more actual &ldquo;adult&rdquo; professors don&rsquo;t realize how low academia has sunk: Now filled with academic parasites (who&rsquo;ve never run a business in their lives) who use their unaccountable positions as a base of operations for radical intolerant leftwing political activity and propaganda. (I&rsquo;m really sure your classes are intellectually &#8220;balanced&#8221;.)<br>
By the way, I&rsquo;m quite pro-Hispanic and pro-Asian, before YOU jump to conclusions. (I&rsquo;m also one-eighth Chickasaw and think it would be a good idea for YOU to leave this country, since you think it &ldquo;stolen goods&rdquo;. Might I suggest Haiti or the Nigeria? Or are you too racist for that?)<br>

<p>Hey &#8220;mark lance&#8221;: Isn&rsquo;t it a little hypocritical of you, as an &#8220;anarchist&#8221; to be living off the very system/society you profess to hate so much and that you want to destroy?<br>
Why don&rsquo;t you, and your fellow self-righteous &#8220;anarchists&#8221;, stop leaching off us working taxpayers and earn YOUR OWN living instead? Why don&rsquo;t you and your fellow &ldquo;anarchists&rdquo; wean yourselves off the public teats and start a business and run it the way you think a business should be run? <br>
Until then, you have no business lecturing ANYONE, child.<br>

			<p>The modern liberal has this strange inexplainable compulsion to endlessly look inward.</p>
<p>Slavery still alive in the world today - they don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>Treatment of women in Muslim lands - they explain it away by saying &#8220;that&rsquo;s their culture&#8221;.</p>
<p>Appreciation of the gifts of the west such as freedom of speech - they use it as a club to attack their own civilization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, if you study the history of the &#8220;intelligencia&#8221;, though they claim this great freedom of speech - usually they walk in lockstep.  Why, the intellectuals of Vichy France were the first to start rationalizing facism after the Nazi&rsquo;s conquered France.</p>
<p>Mr. Lance, your arguments are worn out and predictable.  You should study atrocities in other governments.  You should study the Ukranian famine under Joseph Stalin.  That&rsquo;s a left wing atrocity they probably don&rsquo;t teach you at the lecture hall.  The truth is, Mr. Lance, that left wing atrocities are just as bad - if not worse - than right wing atrocities.</p>
<p>You need to become more familiar with native American history.  While I respect their ways - it wasn&rsquo;t all a peace and love campout.  You need to take the doobie out of your mouth to realize that all cultures are capable of violence.</p>
<p>The radical leftist, marching in lockstep, looks only at the flaws of the west and not at the things the west does right.  I assume Mr. Lance that you like your freedom of speech and your freedom of religion.  Why is it the whitest countries in the world are also the best places to live.</p>
<p>Oooops, I said it.  I mentioned the dreaded concept of race.</p>
<p>Mr. Lance, if we wanted to live in South america we would just move there.  Pleace don&rsquo;t try to transform our country into a banana repuplic with your phoney arguments of guilt and how we owe everybody something.    </p>
<p>The only thing we owe Mexico is regime change.  That corrupt good for nothing Mexican government which keeps it&rsquo;s own people in poverty needs to go.</p>
<p>You want to do some good Mr. Lance, please speak out on corruption in the Mexican government.  Mr. Lance, Mr. Lance, - can you hear me????</p>
<p>There goes that old liberal blank spot again.</p>

<p>About once a month, I&rsquo;ll read a news story about how some liberal/global group ranks countries based on one factor or another, and it virtually always turns out that white countries are on top, black ones at the bottom, and formerly white countries becoming more non-white with time slip in those rankings from year to year.

<p>As I pointed out in my above post to that erudite thinker, Mr. Lance, we all started on a level playing field when our human progentitors, the Cro-Magnons appeared. Whites advanced. Other races at a proportionately MUCH SLOWER pace. Africans (the kind we think of as Blacks), NOT AT ALL! The reality being the Blacks at the time Europeans started exploring the area below the Sahara, being regarded as having barely developed past the Stone Age, mentally. Interminable tribal warfare, ritual cannibalism, and all that great stuff! Not the kind of thoughs Mr. Lance would prefer us to hold of Africans (or, for that matter, the Indian ancestors of the Mestizos). Cannibalism and ritual sacrifice being paramount in the Aztec and Mayan civilizations   &mdash;   their other achievements notwithstanding.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s the typical liberal college professor, riding the politically correct ideology gravy train. &#8220;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
Furthermore, he&rsquo;s not expressing a single original thought.  People like that   &mdash;   although I&rsquo;m sure they consider themselves to be quite independent thinkers   &mdash;   are really just cringing conformists, following the herd, mouthing whatever is the popular ideology of the day.   Of course, they don&rsquo;t see themselves that way. </p>
<p>The fact is, he would be much more courageous and original if he dared to go against the herd. But he does not. Confronting orthodoxy is dangerous. It&rsquo;s much safer to conform.</p>
