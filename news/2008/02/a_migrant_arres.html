<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>THE full extent of the damage unlimited immigration is causing to the fabric of society is revealed by a Daily Express investigation today.</p>
<p>Figures show that a foreigner is being arrested every four minutes on the streets of Britain.</p>
<p>Hundreds of migrants and other visitors are held every day as a devastating result of the Government&rsquo;s open door policy.</p>
<p>In some forces, arrests of foreigners account for one in seven of all those detained. Poles have now become the worst foreign offenders after hundreds of thousands flocked here following Labour&rsquo;s decision to throw open our jobs market.</p>
<p>Alan Gordon, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, said: &#8220;Immigration on the scale we have experienced is putting an intolerable strain on all public sectors, not only policing. We have got to recognise the need for additional resources where there are large congregations of migrant workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Daily Express investigation presents the most detailed picture yet of the impact immigration is having on crime levels and police resources.</p>
<p>It shows that violence is one of the most common offences committed by migrants, along with theft, fraud, immigration violations and drugs. The revelation comes just a week after three police chiefs warned that the influx of migrant workers has contributed to a crime explosion.</p>
<p>The problem has become so acute that the Home Secretary has called a summit meeting with all 43 chief constables to address the issue.</p>
<p>But rank-and-file police last night blamed the Government for failing to see the problem coming, while opposition MPs stepped up calls for an annual limit on migrants.</p>
<p>Shadow Home Secretary David Davis said: &#8220;This clearly demonstrates the impact that Labour&rsquo;s chaotic immigration policy is having on police resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why Labour must adopt our policy of controlling immigration. This means putting transitional arrangements in place for future EU countries and setting an annual limit on non-EU immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;When setting this limit, the Government should take into account the impact of immigration not just on the economy, but on housing and the wider public service infrastructure, including police capability to cope with any population increase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Figures from 26 police forces received under the Freedom of Information Act showed that a total of 79,308 foreign nationals were arrested in 2006 &mdash; the latest year for which figures are available. They represented seven per cent of the total number of arrests.</p>
<p>If the level of arrests was reflected across the remaining forces which failed to supply information, it would mean more than 131,100 foreigners arrested in one year. That is the equivalent of up to 360 a day, or one every four minutes.</p>
<p>In the Cambridgeshire and Met force areas, foreign arrests accounted for 15 per cent of all detentions  that year &mdash; the equivalent of one in seven.</p>
<p>Polish migrants account for the most arrests, with more than 7,300 detained across 18 forces alone.</p>
<p>It is a result of the huge influx of Eastern Europeans since the expansion of the EU in 2004 and the Government&rsquo;s decision to provide full access to the jobs market.</p>
<p>Up to 500,000 Poles have officially arrived, but experts believe that the true number is far higher.</p>
<p>Lithuanians and Latvians, two other new EU members, also appear in the top 10 nationalities for arrests across the 18 forces which provided a breakdown.</p>
<p>A Tory MP warned that gypsy children are worth as much as £100,000 a year each to immigrant crime lords who use them to steal and to milk the benefits system.</p>
<p>At least 2,000 Roma children are thought to be involved &mdash; many too young to be prosecuted even if they are caught.</p>
<p>Conservative Anthony Steen also said the number of Romanian criminals had soared by 786 per cent in London alone, while Bulgarian offenders had rocketed by about 250 per cent.</p>
<p>The Daily Express research also provided an alarming picture of the prevalence of violence among foreigners in Britain.</p>
<p>A dozen forces provided a de tailed breakdown of why suspects had been arrested. Some form of violence, from affray to assaults to murder, appeared in the top five of every one.</p>
<p>Theft, fraud, immigration and drugs were also all prevalent, while sex crimes appeared in the top five offences among three forces.</p>
<p>Mr Gordon of the Police Federa tion said: &#8220;The Govern ment&rsquo;s policy on immigration does not take into account the fact that immigration on the scale we have experienced is putting an intol erable strain on all public sectors, not only policing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am aware the Home Secretary is calling a summit meeting and we have got to recognise the need for additional resources in parts of the country where there are large congregations of migrant workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stressed it is vital that not all migrant workers are stigmatised with links to crime and said only a small minority are responsible for the majority of offences.</p>
<p>The Government&rsquo;s immigration policy and its impact on our towns and communities is under an intense spotlight.</p>
<p>One prediction estimates there will be 9.1million immigrants by 2030 &mdash; up from 5.4million at present.</p>
<p>Last month Northamptonshire Chief Constable Peter Maddison admitted that his force was under unworkable pressure because of the  growth in migrant workers. He spoke out days after the Chief Constable of Kent, Mike Fuller, warned that his force was facing pressures on issues such as translation costs.</p>
<p>He said migration surges had contributed to an increase of more than a third in violent crime over five years to 7,800 incidents last year.</p>
<p>Cambridgeshire Chief Constable Julie Spence has also revealed that her force is struggling to control the disorder resulting from mass immigration. She said she needed more resources to deal with the influx of Eastern Europeans.</p>
<p>Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has now written to all chief constables asking for an urgent summit on links between immigration and crime.</p>
<p>She has also asked the Migration Impact Forum, which is examining the effects of immigration on our communities, to investigate the impact on crime levels.</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman said: &#8220;The vast majority of people who come to the UK play by our rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, we have made it perfectly clear that anyone breaking the law, irrespective of whether they are a British citizen or a foreign national, can expect prosecution and, where appropriate, a custodial sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are listening to the concerns of the police. The police service has benefited from a significant increase in resources over the last decade, with spending rising by nearly £5billion from £6.2billion to £11billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police funding formula is used to make an assessment of the relative demands placed on each police authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s vital that we take the social impact of immigration into account.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why we set up the Migration Impacts Forum, so public services such as the police can help to shape our tough points system, which will be introduced in around 60 days&rsquo; time.&#8221;<br>

<p>Living in the vicinity of a large population of gypsies, I can assure you that these people are definately prone to crime. They are also prone to getting highlights, mystic tans, and really tacky clothing and jewelry. But the crime is the main issue here.</p>

			<p>England may be the first European nation to come around to common sense again and close their borders.  Next, they must pare down their immigrant population.  Africa has a lot of space for downtrodden people to work out their problems.</p>

<p>Not having done that before considering ANY KIND of importation of warm bodies is the work of total and complete, absolute fools.</p>
<p>In all their grandeur and wisdom, these are the types who have decided they know best what we should have.<br>
 <br>
That they&rsquo;re not toppled and hanged is amazing in and of itself.</p>

			<p>did i read that correctly? they are debating a &#8220;points system&#8221;? ridiculous! the cure is obvious, simple and free. fine businesses a substantial sum for every illegal they employ. fine managers a substantial sum for every apartment they rent/lease to an illegal. fine banks a substantial sum for every check they cash for an illegal. if the government did this, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any need to deport them. they would deport themselves.</p>

			<p>Thank God for Eastern European immigrants!  They have opened the door to a frank discussion of immigration&rsquo;s ills among Britain&rsquo;s PC elites.  They would never have dared open their mouths against the anti-social tendencies of non-white immigrants.</p>

			<p>Well, an important first step might be to stop being manipulative by calling them migrants.  These are criminal, fugitive, illegal aliens.  If you are honest about what they are, you can start doing what is necessary to correct the problem.</p>

<p>Yes, and that limit needs to be negative - start sending them home, forcibly if necessary.</p>
<p>Labour is quite clearly devoted to increasing immigrant numbers as fast as possible, because they know that the faster they do the more quickly socialism will be entrenched as the majority preference of voters, do to the leftism of immigrants.</p>

			<p>The basis of civilization is the extension of kinship far beyond tribal limits to people who are only very distant relations.  Modern Marxists believe that civilization can be extended to all bipedal humanoids, and they cannot be dissuaded by factual observation.  Of course, the introduction into a civilization of significant numbers of people who reject the ethics of that civilization can easily topple it.  Western civilization is doomed.</p>

			<p>Identifyling Poles as the problem is a ruse of the multicults who seem to forget that their organs of communications have been replete with news of assaults and crime by blacks and other people of color long before Poles were allowed entrance into their country.</p>
<p>This is their way of thinking they&rsquo;re helping to combat &#8220;prejudice&#8221; against minorities, which is another way of saying they cover up those crimes and pretend whites are the concern.</p>
<p>They should be grabbed, trussed up with rope and thrown right in the middle of the non-white sector to experience first hand the joys of diversity.  And they should be warned that trying to leave is a hanging offense.</p>

&ldquo;damage unlimited immigration is causing to the fabric of society&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;a foreigner is being arrested every four minutes on the streets of Britain&rsquo;.<br>
&ldquo;devastating result of the Government&rsquo;s open door policy&rdquo;.<br>
&ldquo;Immigration on the scale we have experienced is putting an intolerable strain on all public sectors&rdquo;. <br>
&ldquo;violence is one of the most common offences committed by migrants&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;influx of migrant workers has contributed to a crime explosion&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Just look at the blunt and audacious words above! Has someone been spreading Johnny Howarditis?<br>
What is apparent is that due to the massive influx of Eastern Europeans (Whites), is that it is only now that the media and the police feel comfortable writing about the &ldquo;devastating results of the Govt&rsquo;s open door policy&rdquo; with such a brazen lack of consideration for the feeelings of these foreigners.  For us at Amren and the British people it&rsquo;s a small comfort and such a pity that Poles, who are true Europeans seem to be getting the brunt of the criticism when WE KNOW that it&rsquo;s Asians, West Indian Blacks and other assorted Africans and Middle Easterners who are responsible for this devastation to an even greater extent than Eastern Europeans.  I suspect what has happened is that the crime that these latest immigrants are committing has tilted the scales to such an extent that it cannot be ignored and they are the scapegoats who are are getting all the blame for the underlying crime committed by the coloureds. <br>
 But it&rsquo;s a start and it&rsquo;s a smaller hurdle for us to cross, because if criticism of white immigrants is tolerated it cannot be too improbable that this &lsquo;tolerant&rsquo; attitude will cross to all immigrants, at last to include those who are responsible for the devastation of a once delightfully homogenous country. </p>
<p>Slowly but surely we are being proven correct. <br>
Arc.<br>

			<p>Yes we know that the UK now leaks like a sieve&hellip;.the question is, when is someone going to bung up the hole? I can&rsquo;t help believing that the government of the day is actually turning a very blind eye to the matter. As an indigenous Briton who has lived for over 50 years in this country, I have observed its demise with great sadness coupled with real anger.<br>
The fact is that the greater the population of the UK the more taxes that can be raised - the mass of people live on credit due to  the huge taxation that we have to bear. For those of you outside the UK here are some statistics:<br>
1) Petrol at 10 US dollars a gallon.<br>
2) Purchase tax on goods at 17.5 per cent.<br>
3) A pint of beer at 5 to 6 dollars.<br>
4) Cigarettes at 10 dollars for twenty. <br>
plus, we have the war in Iraq which is costing 500 million US dollars per month and our services and infrastucture are falling apart.<br>
The sad fact is that we need a huge increase in our population in order to keep our heads above the waters of bankcruptcy.<br>
For all of the political rhetoric, not one person has a real and viable solution&hellip;.will the last person to leave please turn the lights out.</p>

			<p>Yes,these immigrants have contributed so much to the economy through working over here.Never mind it all gets sent back to their own country and our taxes are spent on policing them.</p>
<p>Of course a think tank will no doubt be set up to analyse the resaon behind it and throw more money at them.</p>

<p>Why do they keep arresting this person, and why do they release him within minutes?  We need answers.</p>

			<p>As the article says, while some of these criminals are Gypsies (who neither Brits nor Eastern Europeans want in their countries) others are native Eastern Europeans who are basically &#8220;white trash&#8221; and career criminals like the indigenous British &#8220;yobs&#8221; and &#8220;chavs&#8221;. Many of the Latvians and Lithuanians mentioned are probably ethnic Russians, BTW. <br>
I do not believe that all White people are good or that all or most non-White people are bad. I am not &#8220;WN&#8221;; I place a greater importance on religion and culture than on race. If I were British, I would prefer immigration from Latvia, Poland or other European nations to that from Nigeria, Pakistan or other areas outside Europe, but I would rather have an honest neighbor from, say, India than a criminal neighbor from Romania or Lithuania.<br>
I do think in today&rsquo;s multicultural PC climate, it is more politically acceptable to discuss problems associated with White European immigrants than problems associated with non-White African and Muslim immigrants, even if the latter are more significant and longer-lasting. That is wrong.<br>
