						<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; A national Latino group said Thursday it is fighting back against what it considers to be &#8220;hate speech&#8221; that has emerged from the debate over immigration.</p>
<p>National Council of La Raza President Janet Murguia announced plans to pressure television network executives and candidates seeking their parties&rsquo; presidential nominations to clamp down on such remarks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the remarks the Hispanic group identified included referring to immigrants as an &#8220;army of invaders&#8221; or an &#8220;invading force,&#8221; associating immigrants with animals, accusing immigrants of bringing crime and diseases like leprosy to the U.S., and purveying a conspiracy theory that Latinos are trying to take back parts of the United States once ruled by Mexico.</p>
<p>Murguia named as offenders Pat Buchanan, who appears on MSNBC as a commentator, CNN&rsquo;s Lou Dobbs and Glenn Beck of Headline News, a CNN network.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Murguia accused the television networks of cloaking members of hate groups as anti-immigrant experts on their programs. Among those she singled out was Jim Gilchrist, a co-founder of the Minuteman Project.</p>
<p>In response, Gilchrist called the National Council of La Raza a racial supremacy group that &#8220;dwarfs the combination of Black Panthers, KKK, American Indian Movement and Asian gangs.&#8221;</p>

			<p>LA RAZA? THE RACE? And we are the &#8216;haters&rsquo;? ANYTHING Whites say to defend their own country and racial dissposession from the hordes from the 3rd world is HATE, according to these alphabet orgs! La Raza is just another offshoot from the ADL, JDL, SPLC, ACLU and NAACP. ALL these groups need to be indicted under the Rico Act! We had better stand up and do somethingabout it NOW, not a month from now or a year or two from now, it will be too late! We sit and fiddle while America burns! </p>

			<p>This is what&rsquo;s most concerning about Third-World immigrants, particularly those from Latin America.  They are used to living under tyrannies and despots are are not accustomed to free speech.   Instead of refuting what others say with facts and logic, they just want to shut them down completely.  Its not &#8220;Pat Buchanan is wrong and here&rsquo;s why&hellip;&#8221;  its &#8220;Get him off the air, he&rsquo;s a racist.&#8221;  Fortunately Buchanan, Dobbs, and Beck have juice, have millions of views, and make millions for their respective networks.  I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going anywhere.   </p>

			<p>*Some of the remarks the Hispanic group identified included referring to immigrants as an &ldquo;army of invaders&rdquo; or an &ldquo;invading force,&rdquo;*</p>
<p>Question: When hordes of poor white people flee oppression, tyranny and poverty in Europe, attack the natives, bring diseases and generally try to transplant their culture to the new place, and generally try to better themselves and their descendants why is this called *colonialism*, *racism* etc, yet when Hispanics do it it&rsquo;s called &#8220;immigration&#8221;?</p>
<p>*associating immigrants with animals,*</p>
<p>Well, with some of the habits they&rsquo;ve brought with them I&rsquo;m not surprised!</p>
<p>*accusing immigrants of bringing crime and diseases like leprosy to the U.S.,*</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s either from Mexico (where such things are abundantly apparent among the poorer members, who often flee to the U.S) or the other Third-World invaders&hellip;</p>
<p>*and purveying a conspiracy theory that Latinos are trying to take back parts of the United States once ruled by Mexico.*</p>
<p>Like the various claims by MEXICAN-&#8220;American&#8221; organisations that:</p>
<p>*This is a Reconquista*?</p>
<p>Please - it&rsquo;s as much &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; as &#8220;hate speech&#8221;, amigo.</p>

			<p>Presumably, the heads of each of those named networks will inquire to Ms. Murguia, exactly why her organization is called &#8220;The Race&#8221; and how that is somehow NOT discriminatory. The very nerve of people and organizations like this, who don&rsquo;t even have the decency to blush at such naked hypocrisy speaks volumes about just how far gone America really is! </p>

			<p>These La Raza racists,exotic disease carrying(Chagas, etc.),cultural people have the chutzpah to deny the absolute, so help my God, absolute truth about in what they &#8221; bring to the american people&rsquo;s table &#8221; ; they are either : the most evil invading culture or most insane culture or intoxicated (Americans in big numbers are slaughtered by illegal Mexican drunk drivers on our highways) or all three reasons. If La Raza has so much energy and claim they produce a &#8221; positive affect &#8221; on america, then why don&rsquo;t they put this economic and cultural dynamo back in their own homeland they they claim that they love the most ? Reinvest in your own country and culture, believe me, they need you way more then us.</p>

			<p>La RAza: The Race &#8220;for those inside the race everything; for those outside the race; NOTHING.<br>
 The stated goal is to take all border states from Texas to Oregon and southern Colorado. Some of thier high ranking members have called for the complete elimination of the white race.<br>
 The hyprocisy of these people is beyond belief.They lie, tell more lies and then tell even more lies to back up the lies they&rsquo;ve already told!</p>

			<p>Here is a link to a comment regarding the actual mening of &#8220;La Raza&#8221;:</p>
<p>http://geocities.com/readerswrite/commentaries/Differences_between_races.htm#Add2</p>
<p>La Raza gained notoriety as ethno-centric Hispanic organization whose racial egoism, which often takes forms of rasism (should we say &#8220;ra<b>z</b>ism&#8221;?), seems to be at odds with the principles of color-blind society. As a matter of fact, La Raza advocates ethnic purges in the U.S. by means of Hispanic populations pushing the Caucasian population &#8220;back&#8221; to Europe. </p>
<p>I wrote &#8220;back&#8221; in quotation marks because the majority of those whom La Raza doesn&rsquo;t like, solely because of the white color of their skin, have never been to Europe.<br>

			<p>Ms Murguia needs to complain to MEChA, since that organization provided Lou Dobbs and Glenn Beck with all the material they need to demonstrate the separatist movement within the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each word in MEChA symbolizes a great concept in terms of la causa. Movimiento means that the organization is dedicated to the movement to gain self-determination for our people. Estudiantil, identifies the organization as a student group for we are part of our Raza&rsquo;s future. At the heart of the name is the use of the identity: Chicano. At first seen as a negative word, now taken for a badge of honor. In adopting their new identity, the students committed themselves to return to the barrios, colonias, or campos and together, struggle against the forces that oppress our gente. Lastly, the affirmation that we are Indigenous people to this land by placing our movement in Aztlan, the homeland of all peoples from Anahuak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Copied from the National Website of MEChA.<br>
<a href="http://www.nationalmecha.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalmecha.org/about.html</a></p>
<p>You will also find this cute unAmerican quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Adamant rejection of the label &#8220;Mexican-American&#8221; meant rejection of the assimilation and accommodationist melting pot ideology that had guided earlier generations of activists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>

			<p>Maybe la raza stands for the &#8220;race to see who can say the most idiotic statement&#8221;.  I think we have a clear winner.  There is a freedom to call these mestizos what they are very liberating.  If grade school dropouts can call me racist that is ok with me, because I have to consider the source.</p>

<p>La Raza and all of their other racist and corrupt open border groups have the nerve to attack our patriots who have the courage and integrity to say it for what it is and stand up for America! We need more, more and more American patriots to stand up for America! </p>
<p>These illegal alien invaders and their supporters are literally trembling in fear because we&rsquo;re expressing the truth for what it is; and as Tony Soprano said, &#8220;Those who call truth &#8220;hate&#8221; hate the truth!&#8221;  Ain&rsquo;t that the truth!</p>

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  <br>
It&rsquo;s not discriminatory, in her mind, because the word &#8220;race&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t carry the stigma and shock value that it does in English. They have NOT BEEN TAUGHT to be ashamed of race, as we have. Thus, she can say it with her head  held high and  without the slightest twinge of guilt or shame.  And racial SOLIDARITY is not considered disgraceful or immoral.  Most whites would cringe with shame because we have been brainwashed to believe that it&rsquo;s wrong.  She has not.  In short, they missed the programming that we&rsquo;ve had..</p>

			<p>Ms. Murguia is typical of many Hispanic women.  Their very stupidity makes them dangerous, in that they are constitutionally incapable of comprehending viewpoints other than their own. They are filled with a self-righteous anger that actually makes them stronger, because they genuinely believe that, by not simply rolling over and dying at their whim, Whites are &#8220;robbing&#8221; them of something.     </p>

			<p>This is not a problem with SE Asians. They are smart enough not to want to take the USA and bring it down to their 3rd world levels. They know what a good deal they have when they immigrate to the USA and they don&rsquo;t want to spoil it by degrading their new homeland. In fact, many times they become more patriotic to the USA than many Amerucan liberals. I am a race traitor and even I have figured this one out.</p>

			<p>Tell La Raza and Janet Murguia to attack the Mexican school system.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the Mexican schools teach their kids, that the gringos stole the land and because the land was magical the gringos somehow proospered out of pure geographical luck. Now that it is prosperous the Mexicans want it back, (after 160 years of hard work and innovation by Americans).</p>
<p>And what about the fairy tale called Atzlan?  Why doesn&rsquo;t La Raza attack Mecha over spreading that lie? </p>
<p>And also tell La Raza that unlike Mexico we have free speech here and can exchange our views and opinions without censorship.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, what they are doing to the media is tanatamount to blackmail.  Typical underhanded Mexican political tricks.</p>

<p>These remarks are true and the truth isn&rsquo;t &#8220;hatred&#8221;. Also, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if latinos did take back parts of the US, they would still be trying to cross the &#8220;new&#8221; border to get in the US because they can&rsquo;t make a go of their own country despite all of its&rsquo; natural resources, so getting some dry desert that used to briefly be under their boundaries wouldn&rsquo;t change nada.<br>

<p>Read some non-PC American history, Obscuratus, if that&rsquo;s not too boring for you.  This country was not settled or founded by &#8220;hordes of poor white people&#8221;.  Rafts don&rsquo;t make it across the Atlantic.</p>

			<p>So long as there&rsquo;s the endless flow of whacky whites out there to defend these types of people and their double standards, this problem will never end.  La Raza, like every other minority group, recognizes this and will take full advantage of it to empower themselves. </p>
<p>This is just what&rsquo;s happening here.   </p>

			<p>Yea and all the high tech and beer commercials with fumbling, foolish, idiotic white males are hate speech too.</p>
<p>I am glad that someone else noticed the commercials with bumbling white men as the butt of everyone&rsquo;s jokes. Look at the commercials, the white man or woman is usually the one making the mistake or looking stupid.</p>
<p>The above statements are factual, and the next time anyone hears a daughter call her father a loser on a radio or TV commercial, call or write the company and voice your concerns.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;LA RAza: The Race &ldquo;for those inside the race everything; for those outside the race; NOTHING.<br>
The stated goal is to take all border states from Texas to Oregon and southern Colorado. Some of thier high ranking members have called for the complete elimination of the white race.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the USA, many are claiming that ALL of north america is theirs including of course Canada. They believe that all of european ancestry in north america should be sent back to europe and that the americas, both south,central and north are theirs call Aztlan.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Read some non-PC American history, Obscuratus, if that&rsquo;s not too boring for you. This country was not settled or founded by &ldquo;hordes of poor white people&rdquo;. Rafts don&rsquo;t make it across the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please - I wouldn&rsquo;t classify most of the &#8220;later&#8221; white immigrants (i.e. Irish etc) as &#8216;relatively affluent&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry if I seem irritated.&#8221;</p>
<p>I apologise - I know relatively little about the history of white immigration to America, outside the oft-mentioned &#8220;Big Ones&#8221; (German/Swedish/British Protestants, Irish Catholics during the &#8220;Potato Famine etc) - half of my family was descended from the &#8220;early&#8221; British settlers to New Zealand, who were comparatively better-off than the other &#8220;bastard&#8221;-half, a mish-mash of Irish, Hungarian, Dalmatian etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also check-out the &#8220;disease canard&#8221; you mentioned as well.</p>

			<p>&#8220;accusing immigrants of bringing crime and diseases like leprosy to the U.S., and purveying a conspiracy theory that Latinos are trying to take back parts of the United States once ruled by Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
But they ARE bringing crime to the States.  Denying it says more about their immature, and stubborn, unwillingness to live in Reality, than it does about anything else.</p>
<p>As far as the &#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221; about taking back parts of America&hellip;</p>
<p>My goodness, where to start.</p>
<p>I mean, geez, it&rsquo;s exasperating folks&hellip;.these guys.  If they think that WE think it&rsquo;s a &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; then why have they been talking for ages now about&hellip;TBE RECONQUISTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Also, look at the pattern of &#8220;thought&#8221; and how it fits, with perfect exactness, to the Denail of the War Against Christmas that VDARE highlights every year. </p>
<p>Get used to this kind of thinking folks.  I lived for a number of years in Latin America and came across this sort of &#8220;logic&#8221; on a regular basis. </p>
<p>But then, most of us are already used to it with the Left, ie; personal opinion, passed off as ultimate truth, and containing toxic levels of moral self-righteousness. </p>
<p>Overall, I found the people there to be very sweet and kind&hellip;on the surface.  Push past the surface and you will see a people with a high - HIGH - tolerance for dishonesty, and a goofy macho pride with no content. They lie even when it would be better to tell the truth. And Mexico, without question, was the worst offender in this respect.  And the most violent.</p>
<p>It should always be remembered that the lower you go on the evolutionary totem pole, the more resistance to change, the higher the level of concealing dishonesty, the more psychotic, and the more they resort to violence, since they can&rsquo;t not tolerate the high levels of cognitive tension that comes from thinking. Of course they attribute this sickness to a moral defect, IN THEIR VICTIM!</p>
<p>They do it to each other on a routine basis.  </p>
<p>Lastly, for what it&rsquo;s worth.  They might appear united, but they are only united - against us. Not just Mexico, but Latin America itself is a collosal failure.  It will NEVER overcome itself. If anything, they&rsquo;re winning by forfeit and will squander their &#8220;victory&#8221; before they even get it.  Of that I have NO doubt.</p>

			<p>The pen is not mightier than the sword unless it is attached to the bayonet lug of a loaded battle rifle.  If words alone were capable of dealing with the Mexican invasion our communities would have been emptied of these people years ago.  This is not something we can talk our way out of and the sooner we realize it the better&hellip;</p>

			<p>In my family we are split evenly along either law enforcement employees and nurses and/or EMTs, and I live in a border state. The crime wave and the weird diseases showing up in Emergency rooms, as well as the innundation of medical services are all facts! It doesn;t have to be about racial hate to tell the truth, sometimes the truth just stands to prove a point. Remember, most often sterotypes are just pattern recognition.</p>

			<p>The whole concept of hate speech is such an obvious attempt to stop free speech. It&rsquo;s extremely dangerous, since the immplications of this charge, by for instance, government, is frightening.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;..That&rsquo;s what the Mexican schools teach their kids, that the gringos stole the land and because the land was magical  the gringos somehow prospered out of pure geographical luck&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Lucas M at 10:36 PM on February 1 </p>
<p>Lucas:</p>
<p>That gringos stole Mexican land is taught explicitly in California schools.</p>
<p>I had the displeasure of being part of a textbook selection committee two years ago for secondary education.</p>
<p>Here is what is the entire curricula entails:</p>
<p>1) Story after story about noble immigrants from Mexico who are beaten down by evil Whites but manage to somehow overcome White oppression and in the end show them up proving how much smarter they are than Whites.</p>
<p>Did you know Cesar Chavez now has his own state holiday in California? Washington and Lincoln&rsquo;s birthdays have been combined (down-graded) into an all-purpose President&rsquo;s Day.<br>
  <br>
Plenty of streets have been re-named Cesar Chavez Blvd. as well (sidebar:  Cesar Chavez was adamantly opposed to open immigration from Mexico because it depressed the wages of the farm workers he was trying to help).</p>
<p>2) Story after story about noble blacks living under the thumbs of tyrannical, unbearable, racist, murderous, slave-owning Whites (and I mean ALL Whites, according to the texts) and how they were able to &#8216;succeed&rsquo; against insurmountable White subjugation (implicit in this is how Whites are to be forever punished).</p>
<p>3) Many stories about the Holocaust, evil White Germans who must to this day be harshly punished for events that happened decades ago in Europe  &mdash;  never mind the MUCH WORSE Holocaust that occurred during the 70 evil years of Communism in the former Soviet Union, that is never mentioned, of course.</p>
<p>From R.J. Rommel&rsquo;s Death By Government:</p>
<p> 61,911,000 Murdered: The Soviet Gulag State <br>
 35,236,000 Murdered: The Communist Chinese Ant Hill <br>
 20,946,000 Murdered: The Nazi Genocide State <br>
 10,214,000 Murdered: The Depraved Nationalist Regime</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM</a></p>
<p>No information anywhere of those pesky Whites who created everything that makes a First World civilization First World: medicine, technology, science, clean water, jet propulsion and MORE.</p>
<p>No, Whites are to be reminded constantly of their evil tyranny against non-Whites and they are to be held accountable! They are NEVER to form advocacy groups, they are Never to question the motives of non-Whites, they are to NEVER complain about the confiscatory taxes extracted from them and handed over to those who did not earn it. They must be brutally punished until the end of time, by having their homelands and treasure turned over unquestioningly to non-Whites.</p>
<p>This is what is woven through the curriculum of the government-monopoly schools in California.  Is it any wonder there is such hatred directed at Whites?</p>

<p>This is not a &#8220;conspiracy theory,&#8221; but it&rsquo;s not surprising that they would use this term to try to trivialize the issue. conspiracy theories generally involve some very small cabal of &#8220;insiders&#8221; who plot some huge crime unbeknownst to the rest of society. Also, most conspiracy theories are false. Not so with the reconquistas. This is not some small cabal but a huge population that is doing this. Plus, there&rsquo;s no secrecy about it. Many of them are quite open about their intentions. Finally, it&rsquo;s hardly a &#8220;theory;&#8221; it&rsquo;s a fact that can be verified merely by looking at the census data.<br>

			<p>In La Raza&rsquo;s utopia, will whites have to leave the Southwest?  What about blacks?  What about Hispanics who have white in them (as most do)?  Will they not ask whites for their inventions (banks, clean food, clean drinking water, computers, money, etc&hellip;) to function?  What will be their goal after we&rsquo;re back to Europe (or they kill us off first)?</p>

			<p>The problem for La Raza is that we have them on film stating that their aim is to &#8220;reclaim&#8221; the short time Mexican Southwest.  I saw it air myself on television in California in the 1980s, before they became aware that they were exposing their complete aims and strategy.  Now, they want to wrap themselves in American flags and claim that we just can&rsquo;t do without them, etc.</p>
<p>The colletctive experience of Americans is catching up to their decades of arrogant struting and demanding nature.  Now, with the Mexican government opening its own schools on U.S. soil, no claim of invasion can be held to be part of any conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>I want them all out.  </p>

<p>They are certainly not quick learners.  They are simply being coached by the same exploitive communists entities that previously coached the blacks.  They are also too late since calling someone a racist today is akin to shooting blanks at a charging rhinoceros&hellip;</p>
