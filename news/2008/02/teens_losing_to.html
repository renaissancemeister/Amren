						<p>Don&rsquo;t count on your typical teenager to nod knowingly the next time you drop a reference to any of these. A study out today [by Rick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute] finds that about half of 17-year-olds can&rsquo;t identify the books or historical events associated with them.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years after the federal report A Nation at Risk challenged U.S. public schools to raise the quality of education, the study finds high schoolers still lack important historical and cultural underpinnings of &#8220;a complete education.&#8221; And, its authors fear, the nation&rsquo;s current focus on improving basic reading and math skills in elementary school might only make matters worse, giving short shrift to the humanities &mdash; even if children can read and do math.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among 1,200 students surveyed:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;43% knew the Civil War was fought between 1850 and 1900.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;could identify the theme of 1984.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;knew that the controversy surrounding Sen. Joseph McCarthy focused on communism.</p>
<p>In all, students earned a C in history and an F in literature, though the survey suggests students do well on topics schools cover. For instance, 88% knew the bombing of Pearl Harbor led the USA into World War II, and 97% could identify Martin Luther King Jr. as author of the &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech.</p>
<p>Fewer (77%) knew Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin helped end slavery a century earlier.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The findings probably won&rsquo;t sit well with educators, who say record numbers of students are taking college-level Advanced Placement history, literature and other courses in high school.</p>

					<p>I am a high school student, and I am witness to these things. The education system is all about regurgitation, and students that don&rsquo;t go the extra mile to further their own mind will end up a mindless machine repeating whatever the book or the instructor says. They have no real understanding of any subject anymore, perhaps save math and rudimentary English.</p>

					<p>Before I jump to a sorry conclusion abou this paucity of knowledge, I&rsquo;d like to see these scores broken down by race/ethnicity.</p>
<p>As many people on here know, Africans and Mexicans are being shoved (&#8220;record numbers of students&#8221;)into these classes to inflate the students&rsquo; self-esteem and make their schools look better.  When they take these grueling exams (I know: my son took them three years ago), they hit a brick wall.</p>
<p>One other factor enters into the scores on these AP tests.  Keep in mind that the average African high school senior has the reading level of the average White 8th grade student.  The chances of any junior high kid racking up a 3, 4, or 5 on here are remote at best.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t rip on the scores until you realize that &#8220;they&#8221; are hurting &#8220;our&#8221; scores.</p>

					<p>This is being done on purpose. History is a major part of racial and national identity. Thus, it is ignored to promote miscegenation and globalism. The few insights into history for  White youth are taught in such a way that they are a form of non-White advancement as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Math and Science&#8221; is PC as well. The truth about genetics, Race and evolution is covered up for the same reason History is.</p>

					<p>In California, I think the curriculum has been distilled to a two-pronged focus on Environmentalism and Cesar Chavez, with all other topics presented only in the context of how they affect the environent or the labor movement.  It is a knowledge worse than ignorance.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m a teacher from Russia. And I tell you I&rsquo;m a very good teacher. I did work in high schools in the <span class="caps">USA.</span> My statement is: 95 per cent, at least, of Ameriocan teachers have a zero chance to get a license in Europe. They are simply ignorant. It is not a point that they cannot teach. The point is: they must not allowed even to enter a school.</p>

					<p> Schools to nowhere like they say they have that bridge to nowhere. I read in europe if you go to school for something you have a job and a lifetime career waiting for you when you get out. I was watching lou dobbs and there was a guy that had a computer scientist degree who couldn,t find a job and had to go to chef school to find a job. All them people they bring from India get the computer jobs. Why spend all that time and money going to school for nothing. I,m starting to think there should be a list of people who go to what schools and successfully complete the schooling. Then when they hire they have to offer it to the next person on the list. This would eliminate any discrimination of anybody and take the politics out of it. (The saying is its not what you know but who you know) some people could probably think up something else to rhyme with this. I mean it let a computer pick the people and send them a letter to show up to work based on spot on the list.</p>

					<p>I think these statistics are bogus because they are based on averages. To get a true picture of what is occuring would be to comparison of students in urban schools, suburban schools, private &amp; rural schools. Then show this comparison on a seperate basis not as an average of the four. Of course this will never happen as it will clearly show in which groups the educational problems lay. This is to say it is the inner-city schools which may be shown to drag the averages down. But then of course this would be racism. This is why there is so many poeple leaving these urban areas. These same areas are in a morbid state of decay from the basic infa-structure up due to these people leaving. Schools? Most are so dangerous as to have armed guards to keep the students from preying on each other? Violent crime is a fairly common occurance in most inner city schools. So those who were once the strength &amp; pillars of the inner cities quietly fade to the suburbs and their former neighborhoods surrender to assorted other groups. If Pizza Hut won&rsquo;t deliver there, it&rsquo;s likely not wise to move there.</p>

					<p>Today one of my coworkers, an experienced English teacher, was unable to think of any famous speeches other than the &ldquo;I have a dream&rdquo; speech, which was of course plagiarized from a white reverend at a Republican convention. An English teacher could not remember Shakespeare&rsquo;s speech given by Marc Antony in &ldquo;Julius Caesar,&rdquo; nor could she think of Winston Churchill&rsquo;s famous speeches, such as &ldquo;&hellip;we shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender!&rdquo; or his reference to the Iron Curtain and &ldquo;never have so many owed so much to so few.&rdquo; Most students, public and private, know <span class="caps">MLK </span>inside and out, but have no idea of anything written by our founding fathers. Many honors students and AP students are unable to identify the author of the Declaration of Independence, or who signed the Magna Carta and when. This is the result of Marxist revisionists stifling heritage for the benefit of the undeserving. To quote the play 1776, &ldquo;Would you have us forsake Hastings and Magna Carta? Strongbow and Lionheart? Drake and Marlborough? Tudors, Stuarts and Plantagenet&rsquo;s? And for what, sir? For you?&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Why not come out with the admission&hellip; That the average teen today is so brainwashed and befuddled with the p.c. slop forced into them from infancy on &hellip; they <span class="caps">CAN BARELY THINK STRAIGHT</span>!</p>
<p>Sure, they hear about the Civil War and that propaganda masterpiece, Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin. The p.c. slop tells them the Civil War was <span class="caps">FOUGHT</span> TO <span class="caps">END SLAVERY.</span> While the truth is the Civil War was fought because Lincoln could not accept a divided nation. That goading the Southern States into actual war was the vehicle for Lincoln to force the secded states back into the Union.</p>
<p>The freeing of slaves was only a sideshow&hellip; to fan new spirit into the dispirited North who had seen so many of its youhg men killed or horribly maimed and crippled by the fighting. But don&rsquo;t expect that truth taught in today&rsquo;s &#8220;enlightened&#8221; classrooms.</p>
<p>The 1984 theme of Big Brother (Our Government) controlling every facet of our lives   &mdash;   is coming into fruition some 24 years after the date suggested by the book. Hillary Clinton (Mother KNows Best), is a firm believer in the government&rsquo;s total control over the American people   &mdash;   a truth well established during that farcial Clinton Administration from 1992 to 2000.</p>
<p>Gun control (CONFISCATION) is something both Hillary/Billary fervently believe in   &mdash;   regardless of their posturing; and surely seconded by those other loony senators, Feinstein of California and our Town Drunk, Ted Kennedy, as well as Presidential-hopeful, McCain! (Hey, why should White Americans have the right and the means to defend themselves against the Black or Hispanic criminal element? Who do these arrogant Whites think they are?)</p>
<p>King George, the Bush, would willingly toss our Constitution and Bill of Rights into the dustbin of history to satisfy his own warped ego and vanity. <span class="caps">WELCOME,</span> 1984 (2008), and thank you, George Orwell, for setting us into the proper mindset.</p>
<p>About the only thing too many modern youths care about is that garbage they listen to. Rap music, and other Black trash music. That and obtaining drugs, or alcohol with which to stupefy themselves even further.</p>

					<p>&#8216;97% could identify Martin Luther King Jr. as author of the &ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo; speech&rsquo;</p>
<p>This shows you <span class="caps">EXACTLY </span>where the priorities lie with the people controlling our educational institutions. Are schools concerned with seriously important things, like <span class="caps">ACCURACY, OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS, </span>or <span class="caps">COMPETENCY</span>? Of course not! Performance and standards have been abandoned by the educational system, because those things might damage the emotional well-being of students.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not meaning to be needlessly crude, but there&rsquo;s no question that much of this is related to the underlying &#8216;gender tensions&rsquo; of our society. The school system has been <span class="caps">FEMINIZED </span>  &mdash;   Instead of providing a set of non-negotiable, uncompromising standards on which students can either definitely <span class="caps">WIN </span>or <span class="caps">LOSE, </span>schools want to make sure that &#8216;everyone is taken care of&rsquo;, regardless of objective performance. In other words, they act like a mother in response to her children&hellip;</p>

					<p>&#8220;97% could identify Martin Luther King Jr. as author of the &ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo; speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>What else should any young person have to know? Oh, excuse me, Chester Finn of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute answers that question:</p>
<p>&#8220;What a better thing it would be if people also had the Civil War part and the civil rights part, and the Harriet Tubman part and the Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin part.&#8221; (from original article).</p>
<p>That is the only specific recommendation given in the article of what else a young person should know! Blacks will soon have no need of their &#8220;Black history&#8221; courses, since American history is becoming just a twisted version of &#8220;black history&#8221;.</p>

					<p>A few years ago, the National Constitution Center surveyed teenagers and found that while only about four in 10 could name the three branches of the federal government fully six in 10 could name all Three Stooges.\<br>
When Ronald Reagan delivered his 1989 farewell address to the nation, he noted there was &#8220;a great tradition of warnings in presidential farewells,&#8221; and he would make no exception. He told his audience that the &#8220;one that&rsquo;s been on my mind for some time&#8221; was that the country was failing to adequately teach our children the American story and what it represents in the history of the world. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to teach history based not on what&rsquo;s in fashion, but what&rsquo;s important,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we forget what we did, we won&rsquo;t know who we are. I am warning of an eradication of the American memory that could result, ultimately, in an erosion of the American spirit.&#8221; </p>

					<p>Citizens, parents, educators and most of all politicans have watched as our education system in America has fallen to such a low point in world ranking that it is no longer in top twenty, there are 3rd world countries with higher ranked education systems.</p>

					<p>Just to let you help to fully appreciate the problem, I might note that I have a vague memory of my old high school textbook of modern history and the history teacher giving the impression that the civil rights movement and <span class="caps">MLK </span>have been the best things happening in the <span class="caps">US. </span><b>This was in Finland</b>.I guess the establishment was paving the way for more black immigrants.</p>

					<p>This is being done on purpose. History is a major part of racial and national identity. Thus, it is ignored to promote miscegenation and globalism. The few insights into history for White youth are taught in such a way that they are a form of non-White advancement as well.</p>
<p>6:42 <span class="caps">P.M. </span>has it correct. Isserbyt and John Taylor Gatto (but Isserbyt esp.) clearly delineate the desire on the part of <span class="caps">WASP </span>millionaires, and Boasian social science types that forged a &#8216;working relationship&rsquo; in the early decades of last century (the 20th, to those of you in <span class="caps">P.S.</span>!) to make complacent consumerist drones, and a mulatto mix of complacent multiculties.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we homeschool. My children, blond and blue-eyed will <span class="caps">KNOW </span>their history, to lead their people out of this bondage to Satan and his ethnic minions. [Rev. 2:8,9]</p>

<p>I have relatives who believe this right now. They actually believe that the US went to war in order to &#8220;help people,&#8221; as if World War II was a huge charity event staged by millions of social workers.</p>
<p>As for the &#8220;Civil War,&#8221; the common perception these days seems to be that the war was fought to end slavery. Lincoln invaded the south to free the slaves. The South seceded in order to keep their slaves. That&rsquo;s all there was to it&hellip;</p>

					<p>I place most of the blame on  lackadaisical parenting and television programming. Public schools would never get away with any of thise if parents actually took an interest in their child&rsquo;s education and what they watch on tv; television cements the propaganda while the students are at home. It will only get worse with succeeding generations. </p>

					<p>A further breakdown of AP test scores in 2005 is as follows:</p>
<p>Asians averaged 3.1<br>
Whites averaged 3.0<br><br>
Hispanics averaged 2.5<br><br>
Africans averaged 1.9</p>
<p>I believe this explains who drags down the Advanced Placement scores.  No surprise.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, which group will get a broadly disproportionate amount of college scholarship money?  Uh-huh, Africans.<br>

					<p>On AmRen&rsquo;s criticism of schools: </p>
<p>Why so much negativity? Since when does the sense of the average 17 year old steer the past much less the present? Because they will vote tomorrow? If politics in this country demonstrate one thing it is that the true power exists in those who succeed in framing the issues to be voted on, not on how the voters decide. </p>
<p>The only time 17 year olds determine the future course is when they fill the ranks of revolutionary armies. And that is definitely a scarey thing but I dont see that happening anytime soon in the <span class="caps">USA, </span>do any of you?</p>
<p>Additionally, does anyone believe that the ruling class cares what is being taught in schools? They are designed to prepare adolescents to participate as adults in society. Their purpose is to socialize the next generation in accordance with established <span class="caps">MINIMAL STANDARDS. </span></p>
<p>As long as my parents were who they were I could have attended the worst school in the country and ended up exactly where I am today. My father corrected my grammar, my mother showed me art. The bedtime story my dad read for me and my brother when I was 9 years old was the Illiad and then the Odyssey. I got a 5 on the AP US history exam and never read the textbook or paid attention in class. I got a 4 on the AP European Exam. I could have gotten a 5 in US history in the 8th grade. In my family, it was natural, expected that I would want to know about the history of my own country.  </p>
<p>Most of what I learned about anything I learned on my own, reading books, talking with my parents, talking with my friends, observing, going places, hearing things&hellip;&hellip;.using basic logic in everyday situations to infer fact where possible and derive conclusions where reasonable. And I didn&rsquo;t learn to do that in school (although introduction to the scientific method in elementary/middle school does formalize the principles of logic). School taught me how to successfully interact with a variety of other people, not just students. </p>
<p>I happen to agree that respect and tolerance, touchstones of PC ideology, in the socialization process has lost sight of the objective which was to create conditions where <span class="caps">REASONED JUDGMENTS </span>would likely prevail in the resolution of controversy. Socialization now appears to be perverting principles so that  <span class="caps">JUDGMENT</span> IS <span class="caps">UNREASONABLE </span>in the social context entirely. </p>
<p>In my view, if a school is teaching kids to respect all races and cultures that is a good thing. The idea behind respect in this context is to ensure that issues are resolved by reasonable people instead of fanatics and  reactionaries. Our country has advanced using this principle. </p>
<p>But the pendulum always swings the other way, cause and effect and all that. Besides natural principles, reactionaries can always be relied upon to push until they get their way. But reactionaries through history have been on the losing side, and so presumptively they are unreasonable. We&rsquo;ve got to guard against being reactionary here. </p>
<p>So in that pursuit, lets recognize what school doesn&rsquo;t do. It doesn&rsquo;t teach you anything you need to know to attain the <span class="caps">HIGHEST STANDARD </span>but teaches a lot of what you need to know to attain the <span class="caps">MINIMUM STANDARDS.</span> So most of what is taught in school is superfluous, and as such, criticizing what they dont teach is merely picking the low hanging fruit. There are too many thinkers here to be sniping like this. </p>
<p>Why is anyone annoyed by this study? Why would a sandwich shop stockpile reserves of iron ore, he&rsquo;s got no use for it. The bottom line here is this. Kids that have no facility for the use of knowledge will take no interest in its acquisition. Should this be a suprise? </p>
<p>Do we subscribe to human nature and natural theory or not? If so, and I think we do, apply the basic principles. These kids dont know because they dont need to know. They aren&rsquo;t destined for the upper middle class, cannot be reasonably expected to make decisions that effect others to any unusual degree, and are very unlikely to be responsible for framing the issues for this country moving forward (remember paragraph 1?). </p>
<p>Those kids who because of external or internal expectations are destined to be the guardians of Anglo Saxon Culture (NOT <span class="caps">RACE, CULTURE</span>) and its glorious achievements, principles, ideas and institutions &hellip;&hellip;. <span class="caps">THESE </span>kids need to understand nuance. Natural law, basic principles of common sense, market theory and simple logic informs the conclusion that these are the kids that <span class="caps">WILL </span>know that the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>went to war with Germany because Germany was a clear threat to <span class="caps">U.S. </span>interests. They will know that Japan attacked the United States. They will know that Lincoln bent the rules to get a war because he hated slavery, that preserving the union was a necessary condition, that the Civil War was a complex intersection of Constitutional and Natural Law. </p>
<p>That said, I do not believe that anyone on this board seriously argues that slavery was not the proximate cause of the war. The South would have had no reason to secede were it not for the horrific condition of Constitutionally affirmed slavery in the United States. No reasonable people believe that slavery is a natural condition or justifiable in any way- because no reasonable man would ever accept that slavery for himself were natural or justifiable he would not argue that it was for another.</p>
<p>Just think of it this way and you will feel better. We are all on a need to know basis. If we are the mail clerk at <span class="caps">WASP</span> Inc. there&rsquo;s no purpose to know about the company&rsquo;s <span class="caps">EBITDA </span>or <span class="caps">M&A </span>plans. It would be nice if each employee of <span class="caps">WASP</span> Inc.  had an informed opinion as to how best balance the principle of managerial discretion and the Board&rsquo;s oversight and steering duties. But it is not necessary that they do. </p>
<p>None of it matters as long as reasonable people agree that informed, reasonable people must be in positions to frame the issues (see paragraph 1). Personally, I see no threat to the greatest American institution of all- the institution that it shall be the capable and reasonable among us all that both plot the course and steer the ship. </p>
<p>As long as this condition exists, let the voters decide the irrelevant details - and it wont matter how stupid they are as long as the <span class="caps">MINIMUM STANDARDS </span>are attained by the majority of them.<br>

					<p>Something I&rsquo;ve always said is &#8220;Leave your kid&rsquo;s education up to public schools, you&rsquo;ll end up with ignorant kid.&#8221;<br>
Parents need to augment their child&rsquo;s education with trips to historical sites, museums, and culture, as well as teach them basic manners, etc<br><br>
Schools do none of these, and from what I see, the unfortunate truth is that most kids spend more time watching TV or playing video games than interacting with parents or learning something useful that is not on their curriculum</p>

					<p>On the Civil War:  </p>
<p>South Carolina seceded as soon as Lincoln was elected.  Lincoln had not even taken office.  He was never given a chance to govern.</p>
<p>&#8220;On November 10, 1860, four days after the election, the legislature in South Carolina, the undisputed leading agitator for secession and the home of John C. Calhoun, became the first of the Southern congresses to call for a convention to consider secession. &#8220;</p>

					<p>&#8220;&hellip;.MLK copied his I Have A Dream speech from a black (not white) reverend named Archibald Carey at the &lsquo;52 Republican Convention.<br>

<p><span class="caps">MLK </span>and Alex Haley are two very well-known plagiarizers, covered up or ignored by the <span class="caps">MSM </span>and the educational-industrial system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read many references to <span class="caps">MLK </span>plagiarizing the &#8216;I Have a Dream&rsquo; speech but have been unable to find a citation (for the plagiarism, that is).  </p>
<p>Do you have a reliable citation?  If so, please post it, I&rsquo;d like to add it to my black fraud file. </p>
<p>I actually saw something about this ignorance of American history when I was channel surfing  &mdash;  the interviewer was asking black students what they know about the Founding Fathers.  Answer:  &#8220;There&rsquo;s All Dead!&#8221;  The unsaid part being, of course, that the Founding Fathers were White and therefore insignificant  &mdash;  especially when compared to their true heroes, the plagiarizers <span class="caps">MLK </span>and Alex Haley.</p>
<p>In the schools, Roots is <span class="caps">THE </span>hate-Whitey Bible (the real Bible is strictly forboten, teachers cannot read from it if they plan to keep their jobs).  The &#8216;I Have A Dream&rsquo; plagiarized speech is read every single year from K-12 (it is in every textbook that I reviewed).</p>
<p>My little nephew, who is taking <span class="caps">AMERICAN</span> History in the 8th grade, told me his class is studying the Holocaust and will spend the entire spring semester studying nothing but the Holocaust. He attends an approximately 95% White school  &mdash;  the same school where my niece was assigned Stupid White Men in her English class.</p>
<p>The perverted educational system is all about the singular goal of debasing and destroying Whites and their history.</p>
<p>Therefore, these figures do not surprise me.</p>

					<p>Of course it is being done on purpose as some posters have pointed out. Nothing is more obvious than the attempt to disconnect many Americans from identifying with the fantastic accommplishments of their ancestors. The ancestors of most Americans, men and women alike, worked like Oxen to build up this nation, and their accomplishments are being denigrated or ignored in most public schools. </p>

<span class="caps">YOU GUESSED</span> IT! It turns out to be a fraud   &mdash;   a fabrication from beginning to end. Fabrication being a synonym for blatant lying.</p>
