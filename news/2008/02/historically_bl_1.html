						<p>A study by an advocacy group for men&rsquo;s sports has concluded that athletics departments at most historically black colleges and universities are out of compliance with Title IX, the federal gender-equity law, and that the law&rsquo;s requirements prevent those colleges from luring more male students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Title IX&rsquo;s proportionality requirement calls for the ratios of male and female athletes to be similar to the overall male and female undergraduate population. The study cites data from the U.S. Department of Education showing that enrollment at historically black colleges and universities is 61 percent female.</p>
<p>Wade Hughes, former head coach of the wrestling team at Howard University, a program that was terminated in 2002, said in a statement that this &#8220;proportionality&#8221; requirement was preventing historically black institutions from adding more men&rsquo;s sports teams that could, in turn, attract more male students.</p>

															Study Shows Historically Black Colleges and Universities Struggle to Meet Title IX&rsquo;s Proportionality Test 
						</div>
										<p>
						<i> 
								Press Release: The College Sports Council, February 27, 2008
							</i></font>
						</p>
										<p>
						<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. &mdash; A study released today by the College Sports Council shows that, due to their student gender ratio approaching 2-1 female to male, nearly all of the nation&rsquo;s Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are out of compliance with Title IX_s proportionality standard.  According to the study:</p>
<p>	*&nbsp;73% of the nation&rsquo;s 75 HBCUs that are co-educational and have athletic programs were out of compliance with the strict proportionality standard.</p>
<p>	*&nbsp;30 of the schools out of compliance would have received an "F" from the Women&rsquo;s Sports Foundation in their latest report card on gender equity in college athletics.</p>
<p>	*&nbsp;43 schools, though they didn&rsquo;t get an "F", are still vulnerable to lengthy and expensive litigation.</p>
<p>	*&nbsp;Only 2 schools (Allen University, Morris College) were in compliance.</p>
<p>Among the schools that received a failing grade are nationally known athletic programs like Florida A&M; University, Howard University, Jackson State University and Southern University.  In order to comply with the strict proportionality standard, the gender ratio of a school_s undergraduate student enrollment must mirror the gender ratio of the total number of athletes on its varsity sports.  For example, in order for Howard University to be in compliance with the strict proportionality standard &mdash; within 1% of enrollment &mdash; it would need to eliminate 82 male roster slots.</p>
<p>According to data provided by the Department of Education for 2007, enrollment at HBCUs referenced in this study is 61% female. Institutions that use student surveys to demonstrate they have met the interest and abilities prong for Title IX compliance can add male teams, but the NCAA has strongly discouraged the use of surveys.</p>
<p>"The purpose of this study is to show that schools like the HBCUs that want to attract more male students run into a virtual roadblock when it comes to complying with Title IX_s proportionality standard," said Eric Pearson, Chairman of the CSC.  "The CSC calls on the NCAA to support HBCUs_ use of surveys to comply with Title IX. HBCUs need the flexibility that surveys offer, if they want to use sports to increase male enrollment," Pearson said.</p>
<p>"Currently, HBCUs are struggling to increase male enrollment, and offering varsity athletic programs is one practical tool a college or university has to increase the number of male students on campus, " said Wade Hughes, who was head coach of Howard University&rsquo;s wrestling team when the program was terminated back in 2002 along with the baseball team.  "At the time the wrestling and baseball teams were eliminated at Howard, the university was out of compliance with proportionality. Now here we are again, five years later, they_ve added bowling as a varsity sport for women and the university has still not achieved proportionality."</p>
<p>"Many HBCUs are struggling financially.  Adding sports teams for male athletes will not only attract more students to their campuses, but help to achieve a more balanced undergraduate student gender ratio," added Hughes.  " If these schools are forced to comply with Title IX_s proportionality test, then adding sports teams to attract more male students is not an option."<br>

					<p>I&rsquo;m no fan of Title IX; in fact, I despise it.  The law presumes that the average woman has exactly the same interests as the average man (competitive sports), and that sports activities are more far important than clubs that focus on music, academic topics or religion.  It also assumes that college women are wussies who are too afraid to start new sports or lobby for extra activities if they find their college&rsquo;s offerings don&rsquo;t meet their interests.  Title IX forces the university athletic officials to chase female students around campus desperately encouraging them to go out for female sport teams that have no natural constituency.  Pathetic!!</p>
<p>But, with the above disclaimer, I really enjoyed this article.  I <span class="caps">LOVE </span>seeing racist blacks getting bopped on the head with &#8220;civil rights law&#8221;.  <i><b>Half of the Howard students I&rsquo;ve met were planning to go to law school and study civil rights law!</b></i>  I know from experience that many Howard University students are black fascists and it&rsquo;s fun to watch them squirm under &#8220;equality&#8221; quotas imposed by the same liberal social planners who target whites.  Ha-ha!!</p>

<p>I assure you that blacks don&rsquo;t &#8220;squirm.&#8221; They have no sense of shame and in their minds, this is all racism against them. They would have to understand the contradiction in their behavior and what they say to squirm. </p>

					<p>Two things:</p>
<p> 1) This will soon fade away. Nothing will happen to the Black Colleges.</p>
<p> 2) How did the major universities comply with Title IX in many cases? Simple, they didn&rsquo;t increase the number of women in sports, they just disbanded a lot of mens&rsquo; sports progams. And since  many of them were made up of predominately white men (tennis, swimming, golf) there was little or no protest.</p>

<p>True!  Once again I have overestimated blacks.  Even for a &#8220;racist&#8221; like me it&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to do - I keep trying to apply logic to predict black behavior or understand black mindsets.  Alas, failure&hellip;</p>

					<p>To jewamongyou:</p>
<p>Very astute observation, and all it took was two sentences. For blacks in this country, sports is their messiah and king- more precisely, the <span class="caps">MONEY </span>involved with it. That&rsquo;s why virtually all collegiate sports teams are black-majority, even in states like Iowa, Vermont, North Dakota and Alaska.</p>
<p>Heck, I even thought Georgetown University was an all-black university, like Grambling, Southern, Alcorn State, etc., simply because its basketball teams were coal-black, all of the time. I was shocked when I found out Caucasians go there. </p>

<p>About the only blacks at Georgetown are on the basketball team.  I once made the same mistake as you.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DNC </span>chair Howard Dean spoke at Georgetown last week for Black History Month.  My reaction was that <span class="caps">BHM </span>for Georgetown means watching Hoyas basketball film from the 1980s.</p>
