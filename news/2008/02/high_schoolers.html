						<p>Here&rsquo;s a quiz: Get a pencil and paper and jot down the 10 most famous Americans in history. No presidents or first ladies allowed.</p>
<p>Who tops your list?</p>
<p>Ask teenagers, and they overwhelmingly choose African-Americans and women, a study shows. It suggests that the &#8220;cultural curriculum&#8221; that most kids &mdash; and by extension, their parents &mdash; experience in school increasingly emphasizes the stories of Americans who are not necessarily dead, white or male.</p>
<p>Researchers gave blank paper and pencils to a diverse group of 2,000 high school juniors and seniors in all 50 states and told them: &#8220;Starting from Columbus to the present day, jot down the names of the most famous Americans in history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Topping the list: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and Harriet Tubman. Three of the top five &mdash; and six of the top 10 &mdash; are women.</p>
<p>Sam Wineburg, the Stanford University education and history professor who led the study along with Chauncey Monte-Sano of the University of Maryland, says the prominence of black Americans signals &#8220;a profound change&#8221; in how we see history.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the course of about 44 years, we&rsquo;ve had a revolution in the people who we come to think about to represent the American story,&#8221; Wineburg says.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a kind of shift going on, from the narrative of the founders, which is the national mythic narrative, to the narrative of expanding rights,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I sometimes ask students to imagine themselves in a classroom 500 years from now. What will their teacher say about the 20th century? What were its lasting accomplishments? Of course, we don&rsquo;t know where future historians will focus, but I&rsquo;m guessing that the civil rights movement and the incredible scientific achievements will be the big stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, when the researchers polled 2,000 adults in a different survey, their lists were nearly identical. To Wineburg, that shows that what&rsquo;s studied in school affects not just children but the adults who help them with their schoolwork.</p>
<p>The study acknowledges that the emphasis on African-American figures by the schools leaves behind not only 18th- and 19th-century figures but others as well, such as Hispanic icon Cesar Chavez, Native American heroes such as Pocahontas and Sacagawea and labor leaders such as Samuel Gompers and Eugene V. Debs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> Who Are Most Famous in American History?</p>
<p>Asked to name the most famous Americans in history, high school students put 20th-century black Americans in the top three slots. Here are the top 10, with the percentage who chose each:</p>
<p>1. Martin Luther King Jr.: 67%</p>
<p>2. Rosa Parks: 60%</p>
<p>3. Harriet Tubman: 44%</p>
<p>4. Susan B. Anthony: 34%</p>
<p>5. Benjamin Franklin: 29%</p>
<p>6. Amelia Earhart: 25%</p>
<p>7. Oprah Winfrey: 22%</p>
<p>8. Marilyn Monroe: 19%</p>
<p>9. Thomas Edison: 18%</p>
<p>10. Albert Einstein: 16%</p>

			<p>This is one of the very reasons Ron Paul wants to abolish the Department of Education. What an outrage that two verifiable Marxists (MLK and Rosa Parks) would be named over Ben Franklin and Thomas Edison. And truly great Americans were not even mentioned much less replaced with the likes of pop talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey. This is the sad but predictable result of the relentless brainwashing of American kids plus the failure of parents to take and active role in making sure the brainwashing never takes hold.  A dismal failure on the part of American parents. </p>

			<p>I was driving a `71 Chevy pickup with an &#8220;iffy&#8221; alternator across West Texas in the dead of night a few years back. Out of the darkness loomed a simple green sign that said the next town and gas was 116 miles further on. In the dark, lit only by the dim glow of dashboard gauges it hit me. &#8220;Oh God,&#8221; I said, half in prayer and half in new found appreciation, &#8220;I`m Fu*&!%g Lindbergh!&#8221;  Everyone else is just another  politician or  General playing at war with other peoples lives in my book. That`s my vote&hellip;</p>

			<p>Of course, when you consider that about half of all high school students are black or hispanic, this isn&rsquo;t that surprising. However, I  find it strange that students weren&rsquo;t allowed to name Presidents. If they were I&rsquo;m sure that George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Thomas Jefferson would be high on the list. Also, this survey asked students to name &#8220;the most famous&#8221; Americans, not the Americans they most admire. I hate to admit it but I would probably have named Martin Luther King as well, considering he is constantly shoved down our throats and has his own holiday. Kids aren&rsquo;t as dumb as you may think they are; they usually know when something is being forced upon them. I went through public school indoctrination and I turned out alright.</p>

<p>Who else would a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; group pick? Learning about the unmatched achievements of whites makes &#8216;diverse&rsquo; students feel bad about themselves so they are shielded from real history and are given empty symbolism.</p>
<p>This is like going to auto mechanic school and only learning how to change the air freshener hanging from the mirror.</p>

			<p>Before I say, with finality, &#8220;It&rsquo;s over!&#8221; I would like to see the sample from which this survey is taken.</p>
<p>But it looks bad.</p>
<p>The media, and those who control it, have won. It took a long time, about 63 years, but it has happened  &mdash;  they have ruined this country; indeed they have deceived the whole of Christendom. </p>

			<p>The only way to win our struggle is to get the children out of the government schools.  It is also necessary to get those who are out away from the PC curriculum.</p>

			<p>This can&rsquo;t be happening. If the above list is the result of public schooling, God help us.<br/>
The list should be similar to this one. Since Columbus, it should be, Columbus of course, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Lincoln,  Edison, Wright Brothers, Ford, Neil Armstrong, Bill Gates and Ron Paul. Ok not Ron Paul. The guy that invented PVC piping. <br/>
All these people changed the course of history. Not a popularity contest from the MTV generation. </p>

			<p>Well I don&rsquo;t know what MLK invented or what Oprah discovered but if they&rsquo;d brain-stormed the students first (ie got them to use their brains) on America&rsquo;s most important achievements and then asked them who was responsible (they&rsquo;d have had to google, probably) then they&rsquo;d have come up with America&rsquo;s most important people.  Modern day fame is more often than not a euphemism for novelty, and novelty does not stand the test of time.  </p>

			<p> Considering the way the news media and the schools constantly attempt to ram blacks down our throats (from Kwanzaa through the end of Black History Month each year, it&rsquo;s enough to make you gag), it&rsquo;s not surprising the list these kids came up with. But notice: No great artists, great writers, great cinema auteurs   &mdash;   and certainly not Philo T. Farnsworth. He invented television. I suspect his invention, if not the man, will still be in use long after Martin Luther King&rsquo;s memory has crumbled into dust.<br/>
 <br/>
 Wasn&rsquo;t the exclusion of presidents (and first ladies) from those eligible by the ones who developed the quiz just a clever ploy to keep the number of White males chosen down to a bare minimum? And isn&rsquo;t it interesting that one of the only three chosen, Einstein, was actually not an American but a German Jew? But then, we couldn&rsquo;t expect these kids to pick up on niceties like that   &mdash;   I believe he did emigrate to the U.S. while ostensibly fleeing Hitler   &mdash;   as they&rsquo;ve been taught so carelessly.</p>
<p> By the way, if Oprah Winfrey deserves a place, why not Walt Disney? </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve actually had college educated black people tell me that in all seriousness. Apparently this fact was suppressed from the general public so Whites could take credit for their accomplishments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been told a black man discovered electricity and Ben Franklin, a spectator to this historic event, took credit for that as well&hellip;</p>

<p>The United States of America will be known as the once &#8220;Greatest Nation&#8221; that ever existed; a people who made it to the Moon, but now survive in squalor and live to a ripe old age of 30 years &hellip; if they are lucky.</p>
<p>It will never even occur to them that the people of the ancient &#8220;Great Nation&#8221; were not of their own blood, but were a race of White people, a people who had died off.  It will also never be questioned as to why the new caretakers of this New 3rd World Nation are incapable of reproducing the same Great Nation of ancient.</p>

			<p>Anybody who comes on this board and laughs at the British for being suicidal, remember this list and what our country has come to. Not to mention, our country may be on the verge of nominating a moslem born third worlder for president. Whatever the British and Europeans have done, it pales in comparison to America&rsquo;s path to national suicide.</p>

But in heaven&rsquo;s name how does Marilyn Monroe rate a spot at No. 8, above Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein?  For that matter, how does Monroe out class, say, Grace Kelly?  I see that, for the entire era from 1492 to 1850, only one person (Ben Franklin) made the consensus list.  &#8220;Who tops your list?&#8221;  Hmmm.  I lost interest after Appomattox, but here is my pre-1865 list:  (1) Robert E. Lee, (2) Nathan Bedford Forrest, (3) John C. Calhoun, (4) Sam Houston, (5) Daniel Boone, (6) Simon Kenton, (7) Francisco Coronado and Hernando DeSoto (tie), (8) Lewis and Clark, (9) Sir William Johnson, (10) Edgar A. Poe.

<p>This, unfortunately, is the natural consequence of teaching anti-American revisionist history.  At least, that&rsquo;s what I would say if I thought this list was legit.  Frankly, it smells really fishy.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s, for the sake of argument, say it&rsquo;s for real.  The quote &#8220;that shows that what&rsquo;s studied in school affects not just children but the adults who help them with their schoolwork&#8221; is highly disingenuous.  Being of that age group, I can tell you that, in California at least, this was the first wave of PC revisionism.  The parents had already been indoctrinated&hellip; it has little to do with what their kids bring home.</p>

			<p>      Future Historians will write about the incredibly rapid<br/>
and complete subversion of America; how its own Elite betrayed<br/>
their own people; how its politicians betrayed the trust they<br/>
swore to; how intellectuals were too dumb to see it or too cor-<br/>
rupt or frightened to speak out; and finally, how the media re-<br/>
fused its task of objectivity. Such Historians will marvel at<br/>
how educated Americans scorned those who tried to warn them cal-<br/>
ling them &#8220;racists&#8221; but how they refused to believe even the in-<br/>
vaders themselves-who by this point didn&rsquo;t even try to hide their<br/>
intentions. <br/>
      The great question is whether these future historians<br/>
will be White or Asian. Other peoples either don&rsquo;t do history<br/>

Muslims or Mexicans. There is a chance that Whites wont be<br/>

			<p>I recall several conversations I had with the family next door in Middle Tennessee. The two children were enrolled in jr. high school, near Murfreesboro. It was after Christmas and I was keen to know what was being taught about the Civil War in local public schools.</p>
<p>They had never heard of Robert E. Lee&hellip;.or Stonewall Jackson&hellip;.or Nathan Bedford Forrest. One said he heard of General Grant and Abe Lincoln, but they really did not spend much time on the Civil War&hellip;.only about a day. Here we lived within sight of the Battle of Stones River and a few short minutes from the Battle of Franklin and these children had not been told such places ever existed.</p>
<p>This was 1981. I am sure the PC curriculum is even more selective now than it was then.</p>
<p>Just imagine the above list&hellip;..no Lincoln, no Washington, no presidents of any party. </p>

I see this on a daily basis: A class of children WITHOUT A WHITE FACE AMONG THEM and their WHITE 20 SOMETHING FEMALE TEACHER imparting on them the evils of Western Civilization. This all goes back to the revolution of the 60s. The only way to beat this is to not play their game and immigrate ( the west loves immigration right?) to a defensable nation free of femenism and socialism. New Zealand seems an excellent choice.</p>

All government &#8220;schools&#8221; (that&rsquo;s what they are called) are based on the idea that the child is state property, to be used for state purposes.  In the year 1914, the US education department (yes, they had one then) raised the question- do the schools exist to serve the sla, er students, or do the students exist to serve the school?  The answer was the latter.</p>
<p>The pledge of allegiance (to the Clintons) was written by a socialist flag salesman, Francis Bellamy (1892).  Bellamy&rsquo;s cousin, Edward, wrote Looking Backward around 1887.  It was a look back from the year 2000, telling us of the glorious advances of socialism.  This book had almost as much influence as the Communist Manifesto.</p>
<p>The hallmark of totalitarianism is force against mind- that is, government mind control centers, sold as &#8220;schools&#8221;.  How did they manage to slip this by the Americans?  Voting, as a substitute for real choice, which is contract.  <br/>
&#8220;Free to choose&#8221; means free to elect how force will be used.  Secondly, the &#8220;schools&#8221; were not to be viewed as coercive in the first place- if they had been, they would have been rejected.</p>
<p>Force was understood in terms of the truant officer, to save the kids from lunatic parents.  Force was NEVER to be understood as being used against the general population&hellip;with some very notable exceptions, such as Little Rock and a few others.</p>
<p>A free people have really free schools- outside of the &#8220;man behind the curtain&#8221;- outside the state.</p>

			<p>If we privatized the schools, I&rsquo;m afraid that would solve nothing.  Black and Hispanic kids would still learn the same nonsense, albeit from privately-run multiculturalist &#8220;charter&#8221; and &#8220;choice&#8221; schools.  Institutional arrangements cannot undo the anti-white will to power.  </p>
<p>History is always written by the victors   &mdash;   and the victors are not white.  To change that, we need to make history ourselves.  </p>

			<p>My daughter&rsquo;s school is 75% white.  And for weeks now they&rsquo;ve been drilling MLK into her classes.  Columbus, Washington &amp; Lincolon got ONLY 1-2 days each. </p>
<p>They try to make MLK and the slave issue and segragation seem like it encompasses the whole of American history.  I explained to my daughter, &#8220;You see that field of grass?&#8221;  &#8220;MLK and segragation amount to about one blade of grass in that field when it comes to the history of America just one tiny thing.  And it was whites who eventually ended segragation, MLK never could have done it himself.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Oh but the white males who developed vaccines, antibiotics, hybridized crops (saving hundreds of millions, even billions, of lives), they don&rsquo;t count.<br/>
The white males who developed the machinery that does 95% of the labor in the world (tractors, trucks, trains, planes, bulldozers, backhoes, automation, &hellip;), they don&rsquo;t count.<br/>
The white males who developed modern electronics (transistors, integrated circuits, computers, telephones,&hellip;), they don&rsquo;t count.<br/>
The white males who developed modern materials (plastics, steel, nylon, synthetic rubber,..), they don&rsquo;t count.<br/>
Yea, these kids are really receiving an &#8220;education&#8221; alright. About as accurate and balanced a portrayal of reality and history as kids are getting going to school in North Korea.<br/>

			<p>There is absolutely no telling what is being taught in schools these days, particularly in inner-city schools. I had a black history professor in college who taught us, with all seriousness, that both the ancient Egyptians and the ancient Greeks were black.  And this guy wasn&rsquo;t some crackpot adjunct faculty, he was the department chair and a respected academic.</p>

			<p><i>Albert Einstein was an immigrant who made a huge bomb and dropped it on people.</i></p>
<p>Einstein was an immigrant to be sure, and he did his best work before he arrived in the United States.  But he didn&rsquo;t build any huge bomb.  He did not work at Los Alamos, Hartford, or Oak Ridge, and his sole role in the bomb project was to sign the letter to Roosevelt to get him to start it.  (Einstein was chosen as the signatory because, of course, he was the most famous scientist of his day.)  Einstein had no interest in doing weapons work.</p>
<p>One problem with that survey is that it asked who <i>are</i> the most famous Americans, not who <i>should</i> be.  Where is James Watson?  How about Rudolph A. Marcus, a naturalized American (born in Canada) who worked out the electron transport chain used in photosynthesis?  Somehow I think that&rsquo;s more important than taking a seat on a bus.  How about William Shockley, who led the group that invented the point contact transistor?  He of course became a non-person after he came out as a race realist, concerned about the dysgenic trends in his country.  Then there&rsquo;s George Harry Heilmeier, who developed the first liquid crystal displays, the descendants of which are on everybody&rsquo;s laptop.  Well, I could go on.  Most Americans are taught nothing about who made the important scientific discoveries and inventions of the modern era, which gives legs to all those black invention myths.<br/>

			<p>Many of the posters above confused &#8220;most famous&#8221; with &#8220;most deserving&#8221;   &mdash;   the quiz addressed only &#8220;most famous&#8221;.  Anyway, for what it&rsquo;s worth, I did the quiz   &mdash;   which should be done quickly and without thinking too much about it   &mdash;   and came up with Thomas Edison, the Wright Brothers, Elvis, Robert E. Lee, Ernest Hemingway, Edgar Allen Poe, Marlon Brando, Neil Armstrong, Bill Gates, Henry Ford, and yes, Martin Luther King. On thinking it over, Tom Cruise is probably more famous than all of them, except maybe Elvis. That&rsquo;s fame for you.</p>
<p>If a black man discovered electricity, it was through being struck by lightning. Oh, and Einstein, though he did become a US citizen, didn&rsquo;t invent the A-bomb, though of course the inventors of the bomb drew on his relativity theories, and he wrote FDR a letter in 1939 saying &#8220;you might want to have someone look into this bomb possibility&hellip;&#8221;. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The study acknowledges that the emphasis on African-American figures by the schools leaves behind not only 18th- and 19th-century figures but others as well, such as Hispanic icon Cesar Chavez, Native American heroes such as Pocahontas and Sacagawea and labor leaders such as Samuel Gompers and Eugene V. Debs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the media flaunt a cheap charade of surprise! Only one white in THIS list   &mdash;   MAYBE. Gompers is an edomite and Debs has earmarks as well.  </p>

Just One Example, how they claim a black invented the TRAFFIC SIGNAL what a joke. A black patented a wooden hand operated traffic signal in the U.S. that had been used in England for many years before. General Electric invented the Modern Electric Signal. LOL.. Oh I bet the true story is a black invented it and G.E. Stole the idea.. The Genius Of blacks Never Ceases To Amaze Me.</p>

<p>This is happening more and more where the blacks are claiming all kinds of achievements when they have contributed nothing new to the world. I&rsquo;ve been sending protest emails whenever I see anything this ludicrous and deceptive from any agency. Please challenge them so that the white people who have contributed so much to the world will be properly credited.

<p>Actually Alexander Fleming was a SCOTSMAN, not English (my Scottish grandfather would roll over in his grave if he knew Fleming was being referred to as &#8216;English.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>To set the record straight (with information you will never find in an average American high school textbook, which I&rsquo;m sure claims blacks discovered penicillin only to have it stolen by Whites).</p>
<p>&#8221;..Sir Alexander Fleming (6 August 1881 – 11 March 1955) was a Scottish biologist and pharmacologist&hellip;. His best-known achievements are the discovery of the enzyme lysozyme in 1922 and discovery of the antibiotic substance penicillin&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Chain was born in Berlin to a Russian father who moved from his birth land to study chemistry abroad, and a German Berliner mother&hellip;&#8221; (Chain was Jewish BTW).</p>
<p>&#8221;..Born the youngest of five children in Adelaide, South Australia, Florey was a brilliant student&hellip;who was educated at St Peter&rsquo;s College, Adelaide&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Just one of many GREAT White achievements. Tell as many people as you know; I am sick of Whites (especially children) being taught that THEY are the scourge of the earth, responsible for all its ills, instead of being told of their great creativity and accomplishments with which they gifted the entire world.</p>
