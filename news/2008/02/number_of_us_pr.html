						<p>Fewer American doctors are focusing on primary care, but the decline is being covered by physicians from other countries. The General Accountability Office said Tuesday that as of 2006 there were 22,146 American doctors in residency programs in the United States specializing in primary care.</p>
<p>That was down from 23,801 in 1995, the research arm of Congress told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall growth in the number of primary-care physicians &#8220;has been totally due to the number of international medical students training in America,&#8221; Sanders said. &#8220;We are increasingly dependent on international medical school graduates to meet our needs. Currently, one in four new physicians in the U.S. is an international medical graduate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its report on primary-care providers, GAO said the number of international medical graduates training in primary care had grown from 13,025 in 1995 to 15,565 in 2006.</p>
<p>For specialists, the number of Americans in training went from 45,300 in 1995 to 47,575 in 2006 and over the same period international specialists grew from 11,957 to 12,611, GAO said.</p>

			<p>Hospitals are increasingly hiring their own physicians to provide care under the hospitals&rsquo; insurance umbrella. No surprise the hospitals more and more preferentially hire &#8220;cheap&#8221; foreign medical school graduates, turning a blind eye to any language barrier or cognitive deficiencies that would interfere with delivery to critical health care.<br>
   You son or daughter may want to become a doctor but they will<br>
be replaced in their vocation by someone of Indian or Ethiopian<br>
nationality.</p>

			<p>The average medical school class is only 30% white male.  Increase the number of white males in each graduating class and many will enter general practice.</p>

			<p>57 per cent of new nurses in Ireland in 2006 were foreigners - reflected in pay rates</p>

			<p>I would choose a small community hospital for anything but the most major treatments (cancer or other specialized things). When I had my baby I specifically went to a small hospital so that I would have individual care plus I checked online with the staff directory to see if there were any foreign names. There was only one or two and they were in cardiology so I was safe. </p>

			<p>Well of course. A indian can spend 4 yrs (skip bachelors degree college) in a medical program which is essentially free and emphasizes nothing but passing the board exam, and come to the states and make a fortune essentially knowing nothing about medicine. American GPs would be spending 60-100k on undergrad then another 60k on medical school end up in a low paying hmo job and go broke. </p>

			<p>I read somewhere that the &#8220;physician shortage&#8221; in the U.S. is caused by discrimination against qualified White males in accepting students into medical school.  In their place, women and minorities are welcomed in.  The Blacks and a lot of the women don&rsquo;t complete their medical education, and the women that do downgrade to part time or quit for family reasons.  Voila - suddenly there is a mysterious shortage that just has to be filled by foreigners - an act which completes the aborted act of affirmative action started by deciding who gets into medical school.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We are increasingly dependent on international medical school graduates to meet our needs. Currently, one in four new physicians in the U.S. is an international medical graduate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can somebody tell me why they are refusing whites admittance to medical schools in favor of less qualified minorities from here or abroad, then whine about having to import med students?  </p>
<p>HELLO!  El Retardo politicians!  If there aren&rsquo;t enough doctors graduating, then we need more medical schools.  Would that not be a better investment than building a bridge over a swamp that nobody uses, or spending on other high cost items that are just as silly?<br>

			<p>This is not an accurate statement that 1/4 doctors is a foreigner.  It is true that 1/4 is an Foreigen Medical Graduate (FMG).  There are many, many, white United States citizens who have to leave the country to get into a medical school.  Those doctors then return to the United States and are counted as a foreign trained doctor.    </p>

			<p>If you think <i>we</i> have a physician shortage, imagine the situation emigrant doctors are leaving their homelands with!  </p>
<p>There are at least three Ethiopian chiropractors in my city.  (And yes, I know the difference between medicine and chiropractic, but it&rsquo;s the same principle&hellip;)  Doesn&rsquo;t Ethiopia need Ethiopian health-care professionals a lot more than America needs Ethiopian health-care professionals?</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t get me going on trained Third-World physicians, particularly Haitians and Somalis, who are <i>driving flippin&rsquo; taxicabs!</i>  And they wonder why they don&rsquo;t get respect in this country&hellip;</p>

			<p>I suppose being a doctor and making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year is another one of those &#8220;jobs Americans just won&rsquo;t do&#8221; like not wanting to pick Lettuce for fifty bucks an hour. Right.</p>

			<p>The American Medical schools have not kept up in enrollment as the need for doctors has increased. Some of the inertia in increasing medical school size has the been readily available and exploitable cheap foreign doctors. If a hospital &#8220;sponsors&#8221; a foreign medical graduate under a J-1 visa, that doctor must work for the hospital at a set price and for a determined length of time (5 years). This is close to the old &#8220;endentured servant&#8221; model. What hospital isn&rsquo;t going to lobby their senators and congressmen for more of this largesse?</p>

			<p>The fact is that the profession of the medical doctor is universally the occupation that is most highly coveted and esteemed.<br>
Therefore it is perverse that the indigenous citizens of a nation are debarred from this job in order to appease foreigners.<br>
As a case in point, all doctors in Japan are Japanese, all doctors in China are Chinese, in Egypt they are Egyptians, in Italy they are Italians etc, etc&hellip;.Can you see the point?, in every case thus mentioned the respective governments so love and respect their own people as to reserve the best jobs for sons and daughters of their own people.<br>
Of the &#8216;perverse&rsquo; nations that don&rsquo;t do this England and the USA stand out the most.</p>

			<p>There are more Ethiopian Doctors in Chicago, (just the city of 3 million, not the greater metro area) than there are all of Ethopia.</p>
<p>And what area suffers the most serious deficit of Doctors?  Not the City of Chicago, but Ethiopia.</p>
<p>During the late 19th century the old Quatar dynasty enacted and enforced a law prohibiting the emigration of Iranian Doctors. The idea being that Iranian Doctors should stay home an take care of Iranians.  When the Pahlevi dynasty took over, the law remained in effect until the 1960&rsquo;s.  By that time there were enough Iranian Doctors to meet the needs of Iran.  So Doctors were allowed to leave.</p>
<p>And the immigrant Doctors tend to be medical fraud practicioners, incompetent and often their credentials are the results of sophisticated cheating on the qualifying exams.</p>

			<p>The only way Washington can force &#8220;Universal Health Care&#8221; on the public is to bring down the cost of doctors, nurses and medications.  They plan to do this by importing bogus third-world practioners and Red Chinese and Indian counterfeit pharmaceuticals.  This will lead to countless needless deaths which is exactly what Washington wants, because when American young die they will replace them with alien illegals and when American old die it removes them from the Social Security rolls.  You can be sure that no politician will have a third-world physician&hellip;  </p>

			<p>This may be a little off the subject but a physician friend of mine was telling me about a female Arab doctor he had worked with. He said she was focused and reasonably competent but when they discussed politics, her fangs suddenly appeared and she harbored a deep hatred for the West and despised the US for its&rsquo; involvement in Middle Eastern affairs. I thought about those doctors/terrorists who blew up a building at an airport in Ireland.  Beware if you are forced to be treated by someone who can&rsquo;t speak English and despises you and your country.<br>

			<p>Horrors. We&rsquo;re already relying on being spoon-fed a laundry list of commodities and services from overseas - now we can&rsquo;t even educate enough doctors locally?!</p>
<p>Permit me a brief what-if. </p>
<p>What if&hellip;a nation that &#8216;supplied&rsquo; us with a large percentage of the imported doctors suddenly became hostile and kept it&rsquo;s citizens from coming here? What kinds of compromises do you think we and our leadership would make to turn on the spigot again when our healthcare situation became absolutely desperate?</p>

			<p>Honestly, what do doctors do that is really anything more than common sense?  Hospitals are superbug traps waiting for more victims.  Emergency rooms are often seven hour waits to be told to take aspirin.  Most hospital visits are really wastes of time. Most foreign doctors know this also, no competency required.</p>

			<p>Come on now. this shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard to figure out. When you have our school children learning that Rosa Parks and M.L. King are among the greatest people to have lived in the United States, how in the world could you think these kids would be smart enough not just to get into medical school but to even learn to recite those now famous words of America&rsquo;s high school graduates &#8220;care for fries with that burger&#8221;</p>
