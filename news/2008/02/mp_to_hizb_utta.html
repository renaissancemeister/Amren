<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In an uncharacteristic move, Villy Søvndal, leader of the Socialist People&rsquo;s Party, responded to the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir&rsquo;s demonstration last Friday, by severely criticising them in his blog.</p>
<p>He stated in his blog that the group was to &lsquo;seek other pastures&rsquo; and that their &lsquo;undertakings had no perspective, nor future, in Denmark&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In an interview with Jyllands-Posten newspaper, he continued to lash out at the extremist group whose demonstration had delivered a direct threat towards Danish society, telling them to &lsquo;go to hell&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they want to live in a religious dictatorship so badly, they can go to those countries in the Middle East where such dictatorships exist,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>The hostile tone of the demonstration has had Pia Kjærsgaard launching a new proposal in parliament to ban the controversial group, but Søvndal said he did not want them banned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Instead of turning them into martyrs with a ban, they must be put in the spotlight. It would expose their completely ridiculous views,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>He also lashed out at Kassem Ahmad, a spokesperson at the Islamic Society in Denmark, who had marched alongside Fadi Abdullatif, leader of the Hizb ut-Tahrir in Denmark.</p>
<p>Ahmad had last night met with Birthe Rønn Hornbech, the integration minister, behind closed doors.</p>
<p>About the meeting, Søvndal said: &lsquo;It is strange that religious representatives should be given preferential treatment in a secular democracy. If the minister wanted to speak with ethnic minorities, she could have spoken with members of city council who were democratically elected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He warned against putting religious figures in a position where they were thought to represent the views of ordinary immigrants.</p>
<p>His criticism echoed along the corridors of parliament. Pia Kjærsgaard, leader of the Danish People&rsquo;s Party agreed with him and stated that it was &lsquo;foolish&rsquo; and &lsquo;naïve&rsquo; of the integration minister to think that anything constructive would come out of a meeting with the Islamic Society.</p>
<p>New Alliance party leader, Naser Khader also called the minister &lsquo;very naïve&rsquo; for agreeing to meet with Ahmad and said that the society was a &lsquo;world champion in saying one thing and doing another&rsquo;,</p>
<p>Hornbech dismissed the critique saying that the Islamic Society had asked for a meeting which she had agreed to because she was &lsquo;an integration minister for everyone in Denmark&rsquo; and that she would not refuse anyone beforehand.<br>

<p>However backward they are sheer numbers will make up for it.</p>

			<p>&lsquo;Instead of turning them into martyrs with a ban, they must be put in the spotlight. It would expose their completely ridiculous views,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.  If their views are ridiculous and exposure would negate them, why would banning them result in their being martyred?  Sounds like their tribesmen know very well what they&rsquo;re all about and exposing their views would result in even more hostility among their rank and file, not condemnation.</p>
<p>Note to Denmark:  You screwed up big time, guys, by allowing them in.  Now pay the price for your stupidity.</p>

			<p>      This is way the Pope talks too-he calls for more dialogue<br>
after every affront and atrocity. There is literally nothing to<br>
talk about. The matter will be decided by strength. Talk just<br>
delays the inevitable. In the meantime, their numbers grow.</p>

			<p>Islam is not a religion of peace. The Koran and their actions worldwide prove that. Likewise, Blacks are not a race of peace. The FBI&rsquo;s uniform crime index, along with a vast volume of empirical data and a lifetime of anecdotal evidence, proves that.</p>
<p>Despite these truths, Western corporations, Liberals, and other sorted Egalitarians insist on having Muslims, Blacks, Hispanics, and all of the problems they produce in our midsts.</p>

			<p> Throughout the free world; the ones that demand more immigration from third world countries are the extreme upper class. They live in gated communities with well equipped, well trained and highly paid gate guards to protect them from the hordes that they casually demand the rest of us live with. We are the ones that must pay for thier actions through higher taxes,more schools,hospitals and jails.<br>
 The rage of the common person falls on deaf ears of our elected officials while the soft voices of the rich are listened to intently.If a young black male mutters racism it can be heard over the shouting of discrimination against the white man.The list of discrimatory practices against the white population grows longer each day.<br>
 These practices all fall within the teachings of the Marxist Doctrine as written by Karl Marx. They are winnnig a little at a time and this will ultimately be the New World Order.</p>

			<p>&#8220;When two races come into contact, one will expel the other from the commonly occupied or desired territory, or the races will adjust their differences through a process of inter-race breeding, creating a mongrel race differing from the parent races but with a tendency to eliminate the specialized characters of the parent race. This result follows from the expression of biological laws and cannot be altered by educational program, legislative decree, or any amount of philanthropic interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The only thing that these modern day lunatics have in common with classical Marxism is a desire to destroy civillization. The Soviet Union wasn&rsquo;t into homosexual rights or allowing large scale Muslim immigration. Today&rsquo;s doctrines are much scarier.  A communist revolution you can recover from, from large scale immigration you can&rsquo;t.  </p>

			<p>Tip to ALL countries.  Separate the races, close the door to further immigration, do the work yourselves, and expel any non-citizen who whines.  You&rsquo;d see a happier, more productive, stable and less crime ridden society everywhere that was done.</p>
