						<p>CHICAGO &mdash; In his first major public address since a cancer crisis, Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan said Sunday that presidential candidate Barack Obama is the &#8220;hope of the entire world&#8221; that the U.S. will change for the better.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This young man is the hope of the entire world that America will change and be made better,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This young man is capturing audiences of black and brown and red and yellow. If you look at Barack Obama&rsquo;s audiences and look at the effect of his words, those people are being transformed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farrakhan compared Obama to the religion&rsquo;s founder, Fard Muhammad, who also had a white mother and black father.</p>
<p>&#8220;A black man with a white mother became a savior to us,&#8221; he told the crowd of mostly followers. &#8220;A black man with a white mother could turn out to be one who can lift America from her fall.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Small jabs at Clinton</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton: &#8220;Sen. Obama has been clear in his objections to Minister Farrakhan&rsquo;s past pronouncements and has not solicited the minister&rsquo;s support.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Hope for the entire world? For what reason- That he is partially Black and he may be elected to officiate over a country?  Hasn&rsquo;t that allready happened in Africa many many times over with horrific results?  How does this translate as a hopeful thing for humankind?</p>

			<p> An endorsement by Louis Farrakhan ought to be enough to disqualify any endorsee from consideration for president of the United States. But no, this will be either mostly ignored, or mostly explained away, by the mainstream media.</p>
<p> But the kiss of death from Farrakhan should be, in a world that was abiding by good sense, simply the icing on the cake. Look at what we have here: Barack Hussain Obama was born of a Kansas White woman and a black from Africa, in Hawaii. When he was three years old, the elder Obama abandoned his small son and wife and returned to Kenya. Then this witless woman married another non-White, a Muslim from Indonesia, and went there to live for the next four years. Young Barack may or may not have been a practicing Muslim while he was there, despite his insisting that he is now a Christian, albeit in a black militant, White-hating church.</p>
<p> There are enough red flags and alarm bells there to approximate the second coming of the Great Chicago Fire! And we&rsquo;re about to nominate this charlatan for president? I shudder for my country.</p>

			<p>This endorsement will probably do nothing to hurt his image either just like the photograph released by the Clinton campaign showing him in muslim dress and a turban.  I can understand the black support but young college students?  Supposedly educated college students supporting someone with an incoherent campaign?  </p>
<p>Political commentators say that many people believe that America&rsquo;s best days are behind them.  (I&rsquo;m one of them).  They say that Obama represents hope to some people that America can be restored to it&rsquo;s former glory.  We live in pretty desperate times when some White people are willing to embrace a black presidential candidate as the salvation of America.  Sadly, Obama is an iconic symbol of Americas slide into oblivion.  </p>

			<p>&ldquo;This young man is the hope of the entire world that America will change and be made better,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>This coming from a man that is a rabid anti-white hater, complimenting someone that belongs to a church that is no more than a white-hating operation of absolute disgust, which has a pastor that is so hateful and vile nothing whites can do is above his criticism.  He embraces tenents that make no bones about applauding a policy that its members are loyal only to their African mother country, and his hate-filled, anti-white rants are on a par with the good Reverend Farrakhan himself.</p>
<p>Of course the &#8220;change&#8221; they&rsquo;re all talking about is to allow blacks to control the country.  That&rsquo;s all it amounts to.  This ridiculousness is no different than any of their other illogical, unintelligent assertions and whining complaints of racism and oppression to cover up the fact they can&rsquo;t compete.</p>
<p>And the &#8220;hope&#8221; they refer to is installing unqualified blacks into positions they&rsquo;re not qualified for, unfairly displacing hated whites, plus assuring that all blacks receive reparations from people who owe nothing to people who don&rsquo;t deserve anything. They prove unequivocally daily they can&rsquo;t compete on a level playing field in a first world society.</p>
<p>The only way blacks can survive as a people in a world where all the races of the earth are smarter than they are and have greater abilities is via communisn where everything is given to them or in a Muslim societal construct where they are governed tightly by sharia law.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! Nothing else is a viable option.</p>

			<p>It looks like Barack Hussein Obama will be the nominee of the Democrat party.It is time that racially conscious whites get out the word on this mulatto.The National Journal rated him as the most liberal member of the senate.He is to the left of even Hillary and the socialist Sanders.Obama is for open borders,affirmative action and every other leftist orthodoxy.Let&rsquo;s quit bashing Hillary and alert people to this self righteous messianic windbag.His election would be the ultimate nail in the coffin for white America.It should be our number one priority to educate and convince our people to defeat Obama and all he odiously stands for.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard lots of malarkey from Farrakhan over the years, but this description of Obama is not so far off from the unending praise and adoration that the media pours upon him 24/7.</p>
<p>Sounds more like a description of the Antichrist than an endorsement of a presidential candidate.</p>

			<p>What exactly is the world hoping for?  An end to the US dominance in world affairs?  The dollar replaced by the Euro?  The center of gravity for the world economy moving towards Europe? London as the new financial capital of the world?  A bankrupt nation not being able to finance a large military?  American policy being set by the financiers of our public debt in Europe and Asia?   </p>

			<p>This makes me wonder if Louis Farrakhan has donated to the Barack Hussein Obama campaign.  Probably so, but the media sure isn&rsquo;t telling, are they?  And should it ever comes to light that he has, can we then expect to see the media make an issue of it and demand that the funds be returned, as they did with Don Black&rsquo;s donation to Dr. Ron Paul?  Will they attempt to imply guilt-by-association to Obama, due to Farrakhan&rsquo;s endorsement?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Fard Muhammad,&#8221;</p>
<p>One pure White parent, one parent Maori and White New Zealander.</p>
<p>He had black hair, brown eyes and light tan skin. He was classified as White when arrested a couple times in Los Angeles during the 1920&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>During the depression his door to door salesman career went down hill so he started the Nation of Islam.  It cost $10.00 to join, quite a sum when $15.00 per week was considered a living wage and teachers made $150.00 per month. </p>

			<p>Such hyperbole is so black. What they can&rsquo;t do in action they try to make up for in words!!! Obama is a product of white self hating america. If he didn&rsquo;t have a white mommy and grandparents who took care of him, he&rsquo;d just be a kid living in a shack in Kenya!!! There is no black contribution to him becoming anything!!! Whites are stupid enough to embrace this serpent to its bosom and it will bite us!!</p>

<p>9/11/2001; London, Madrid, Denmark, Paris; Ralph Ellison takes the oath on a Koran; Scotland; Fort Dix; foot baths in Indianapolis and Michigan; Kosovo; Obama is elected - Turkey enters the EU&hellip;</p>

			<p>It looks like Hussein is being backed by the bosses, he is on an all out winning streak . He appears to have all the liberals falling over each other to kiss his behind. If he becomes President Hussein then American is done for and that&rsquo;s what the handlers, the bosses want. I think we are finding out who really runs this nation.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;many people believe that America&rsquo;s best days are behind them. (I&rsquo;m one of them).&#8221; (Posted by at 7:09 PM on February 26)</p>
<p>When Spain was occupied by the Moors, probably many Spaniards thought that the best days of their land were past. But the national feeling and political coherence that developed in driving out the moors led to a period that most historians would now consider Spain&rsquo;s best days (the discovery of America, great cultural achievements, etc.).</p>
<p>Driving out the Moors was, I&rsquo;m sure, hard and anguishing work. I&rsquo;m also sure that it had it&rsquo;s satisfactions. </p>
<p>Of course it wasn&rsquo;t accomplished by feeling depressed and hopeless and fearing to risk the loss of what the moors had allowed the Spaniards to retain. At least a sizable minority of the Spanish population had to feel something larger and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Check out the (extremely rare, in the MSM) focus on the importance of retaining our cultural attributes in the article posted this same day, &#8220;The End of Multiculturalism&#8221;, in the Christian Science Monitor. Maybe awareness is beginning to increase?</p>

Posted by ZKR at 8:24 PM on February 26</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was thinking.  I&rsquo;m not religious myself, but I live in an area where many people are, so I wrote am email to a church elder, asking him if he thought there was a presidential candidate who might be the anti-christ.  Here&rsquo;s an excerpt (From Revelations) from his return email to me:  </p>
<p>&#8220;When Satan comes as the beast he will have so much power and authority that the whole world will marvel.  Almost everyone in the world will worship the beast. <br>
 <br>
&ldquo;And all the world marveled and followed the beast.&rdquo; Revelation 13:3<br>
 <br>
&#8220;He will come as Allah or Imam Mahdi to the Muslims, Maitreya Buddha to the Buddhists, Jesus Christ to the Christians, Krishna to the Hindus, Messiah to the Jews, Saoshyant to the Zoroastrians, the &ldquo;Dark Lord&rdquo; to satanists, and so on through the whole list of 666 names. His goal is to win the worship and allegiance of every person on earth. <br>
 <br>
&#8220;The beast will speak in a melodious voice and he will have friendly, loving eyes. He will be gentle and kind. His appearance will dazzle and charm people. He will be extremely powerful.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;13 He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. 14 And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast.&#8221; Revelation 13:13-14<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Almost everyone in the world will get the mark of the beast. There are many reasons why people will choose to get the mark, chief among them is that they will be allowed to buy food, water, medicine and clothes. They will be able to work and get paid. Humanly speaking, getting the mark of the beast will be the logical, sane, safe, smart thing to do.  (This could well refer to rejecting political correctness and having society come down on you, so that you can&rsquo;t keep a job, if you reject the mark)<br>
 <br>
&#8220;16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, 17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.&#8221; Revelation 13:16-17<br>
 <br>
&#8220;When Jesus was on earth, He had 12 disciples. When the Beast/Satan is on earth, claiming to be God, he will have 12 leading demons with him.  There will also be millions of demons who come to earth at the same time as the first beast and the second beast of Revelation 13. Many of these demons will pretend to be angels from heaven. <br>
 <br>
&#8220;After Satan and his demons have been on earth for a few months the two demons pretending to be the prophets Moses and Elijah will force people to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead. They will enforce the mark of the beast.  The demon who is pretending to be Elijah will call down fire from heaven to prove that the beast is God.    The demon who is pretending to be Moses will work miracles to prove that the beast is God.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Has he arrived yet?  Yes, he is here with us now.   Please listen carefully to his words and test everything he says against the Bible.<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.&rdquo; Acts 17:11 <br>
 <br>
&#8220;His present cleverness has people asking already if he is the Messiah.  Many have received his mark the world over, and many more will accept it in the coming months.  <br>
 <br>
&#8220;The prophecy is now in the beginning of being fulfilled.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Hell has come to earth.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

			<p>The democratic party has been forever polluted by the anti-american crowd. The America before our immigration debacle is despised so deeply to the point where even former president Clinton and his wife are seen as racist. It&rsquo;s gotten so bad that white male candidates are not taken seriously anymore within the democratic party. What&rsquo;s more, the Republican party is polluting itself with the same forces out to destroy traditional America. I swear, if lawmakers back in 1964-65 were able to foresee America in 2008, she would be racially and culturally the same today. America is on the brink of total collapse. It&rsquo;s definitely too late to save her, at least in one piece. Some people say multiculturalism is dying. But instead it&rsquo;s gaining strength each and every year due to large-scale third world immigration.  All this has given rise to Obama&rsquo;s popularity. Even when a racist, demogogue like Farakkan endorses him. </p>

When Obama has the nomination locked-up the media will slowly  unload all the dirt on Obama.</p>

			<p>If any of the White candidates had received support   &mdash;   solicited or not   &mdash;   from, say, David Duke, you can bet that it&rsquo;d be trumpeted as a huge scandal by the controlled governmedia, and the candidate would have to grovel relentlessly to disavow Duke&rsquo;s praise.</p>
<p>But let Obongo be admired by a known black racist and he gets a free pass from the adoring press.  Is this a double standard?  Naw.  Only an Evil White Racist would think such a thing.</p>

			<p>At least Obama is smart enough not to fall into the Farrakhan trap of endorsements. However. it appears though he has accepted this endorsement conditionally though. Obama realizes that the Nation of Islam contains thousands of black votes which he doesn&rsquo;t want to loose. And some of us are as niave as to think this whole election is not a matter of race. Blacks tend to view Obama as their savior as noted by Farrakhan alluding to Obama&rsquo;s racial mixture. Although physically Obama appears Afro-American, he is lily white on the inside. He has the abitlity to mesmerize millions with his speeches but then so did Aldoph Hitler. </p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;A 38-year-old Marine, Tyrone Hadnott, has been arrested on suspicion of raping the girl in a car on Okinawa island, where the bulk of the 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan are based. Police have said he denied rape but admitted forcing her to kiss him.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t help WONDERING, if this is the kind of hope Farakhan is expressing. Tyrone (YOU guess his race), believed to have RAPED a 14 year old girl in Okinawa. Someone kindly explain to me just WHAT is the driving force behind Africans&rsquo; (or Afro-Americans&rsquo;) sociopathic tendencies. Given HOW MANY acts of rape Blacks commit annually in our country, as well as all over the world.</p>
<p>Remember that ridiculous Emmett Till garbage permeating all the media last year? Till&rsquo;s father was EXECUTED for raping an Italian woman while serving in Europe near the end of WWII. Blacks commit a constant stream of outrageous crimes   &mdash;   but cannot understand WHY White people feel about them as we do!</p>

			<p>Note the messianic fervor engendered by frustration.  It is the sad plea of a Nation that has found itself ungovernable.  Never will you hear words of self-reliance or morality, but only the shouts of a people whose minds have grown bitter, and their streets meaner, year upon year.  And when the anointed one fails to deliver?</p>
<p>I could, maybe, sit and google some sense out of it.  I could type just the right word or phrase, the perfect set of quotation marks  &mdash;  even an orthographic slip  &mdash;  and be rewarded with that one glorious hit, the cure for all frustration.  Just another desperate act. </p>

			<p>Barack Obama is the &ldquo;hope of the entire world&rdquo; that the U.S. will change for the better.&ldquo;This young man is the hope of the entire world that America will change and be made better,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This young man is capturing audiences of black and brown and red and yellow. If you look at Barack Obama&rsquo;s audiences and look at the effect of his words, those people are being transformed.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>SCREWEY LOUIE rears his ANTI-WHITE RACIST head once again!&hellip;it&rsquo;s no secret that OLE SCREWEY has dreams of ELIMINATION of the WHITE RACE from this planet!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A black man with a white mother became a savior to us,&rdquo; he told the crowd of mostly followers. &ldquo;A black man with a white mother could turn out to be one who can lift America from her fall.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what color the mother is&hellip;to them&hellip;they are black!&hellip;period!</p>
<p><br>
Said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton: &ldquo;Sen. Obama has been clear in his objections to Minister Farrakhan&rsquo;s past pronouncements and has not solicited the minister&rsquo;s support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He can DENY his relationship to Screwey Louie all he wants&hellip;just as he &#8220;DISTANCES&#8221; himself from his pastor and the RACIST church he attends&hellip;he can DENY all he wants&hellip;but the TRUTH is that he DOES go to the pastor for &#8220;counseling&#8221;&hellip;he DOES belong to a RACIST church&hellip;a church who&rsquo;s pastor presented SCREWEY LOUIE with an AWARD!&hellip;THIS is the REAL OBAMA!&hellip;Barack HUSSEIN Obama!</p>

			<p>As a teacher of Martial Arts (Tanjuu-do) I have to express my sickness at this article. Louie and his bunch at Mosque 26 (San Francisco) were responsible for the deaths of over two hundred Whites in racial murders (See ZEBRA, by Howard). Out of the 20 some odd &#8220;Death Angels&#8221; (men who had killed more than 6 whites)only 4 went to prison. Even writing about him as though he were anything less than a raving lunatic is an insult. The idea that he would be quoted supporting a major candidate for POTUS is enough for me to vote the other way. </p>

			<p>  Barrak Obama is being hailed as our secular savior. There is no way he can live up to all this media hype. The banking system is insolvent, our foreign debt is out-of-control, the dollar is diving, and we are losing two wars. If elected, Senator Obama will be the one left holding the bag. He will go overnight from diversity saint to multicultural sinner. As one commentator says &#8220;America has Jumped the Shark.&#8221; <br>

<p>Sorry, but I wouldn&rsquo;t give up yet. Obama&rsquo;s popularity is starting to tarnish, slowly but steadily. Voting for this joker in the primaries is one thing. VOTING FOR OBAMA in November, 2008 an entirely different issue! A lot of Whites will mouth the p.c. dogma and claim they like him. But still end up voting (sweeping) McCain into the White House. Admittedly, McCain (who has lots of skeletons and excess baggage in HIS closet) is hardly much the better choice. But he still is White! Obama bends over backwards to deny or downplay his half-White heritage. So Whites should sheeplike vote for him? ONLY IF THEY&rsquo;RE BEREFT OF THEIR SENSES!</p>
<p>Amnesty. Open borders. Endless immigrants from Africa. Reparations. Grandiose but unworkable or impractical ideas. Take a good, hard look at Obama   &mdash;   his visions and talk of unifying having no more REAL substance than a rainbow. THEN tell me you can get enough well-intentioned airheads to vote Democratic in November.</p>

			<p>One wonders why blacks constantly see fit to lecture whites on how to be good human beings. Perhaps mainly because whites go along with it. Black people are the &#8220;conscience of America,&#8221; dontcha know. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A black man with a white mother could turn out to be one who can lift America from her fall.&rdquo; What fall is this? Every country which is run by blacks has a terrible human rights record. True, whites are far from perfect, but I think its time we admitted that we&rsquo;re the best thing we&rsquo;ve got going. The alternative is chaos.</p>

<p>Let me go you one better.  They can begin full scale rioting, the like of which will make South Central look like a church picnic.<br>
The pundits can all talk about Black rage and frustration and how the selection was fraudulently engineered by &#8220;the Man&#8221;.  This of course will be the selection of the Dem. nominee not the actual election.  They&rsquo;ll have to lay it at the feet of the Clintons whom they considered their champions.<br>
The irony is that, at the start of his campaign, Afro-Ams didn&rsquo;t even consider Obama to be black enough and in addition, he hadn&rsquo;t lived &#8220;The Black experience&#8221;.</p>

<p>No, they&rsquo;ll continue with their whining, guy, no matter how mnuch they get or who gives it to them.  They could each be given a million dollars a piece and probably 85% of them would be broke or in jail in five years, and the reasons for their failures would be the same ones they cited before they became wealthy.  In fact I&rsquo;m pretty sure they would blame white racism/oppression, because they mishandled their funds and became destitute once again.</p>

			<p>Obama was abandoned as a baby by his black father and raised by his white mother and white grandparents. Obama&rsquo;s black African grandfather had objected to the &#8220;Obama family bloodline being sullied with that of a white woman.&#8221; So Obama&rsquo;s identifying himself as only &#8220;black&#8221;, thus embracing the racial heritage of the black father who abandoned him and the black grandfather who rejected his mother and him (&#8220;sullied&#8221; with white blood), while spitting in the faces of the white side of his family that actually embraced him and sacrificed and raised him from childhood, is galling enough: But then he doesn&rsquo;t simply identify as only &#8220;black&#8221;, but goes much further by embracing black racism and supremacy and racial hatred of whites by integrating himself so intimately with this black racist church and its black racist minister!</p>
<p>On another note: This black racist church declares its &ldquo;non-negotiable commitment to [black] Africa&rdquo; and its culture (but not enough to actually move there). However this is the same black Africa and black African culture where black Africans (perhaps some of Obama&rsquo;s own African ancestors) captured, forced march to the coast (at great loss of life), and sold into slavery the ancestors of most black Americans!</p>

<p>Elrey, have no idea what you are talking about.  There is no such town as Kenwood in Ilinois.  The town (or city) is called Chicago.  There is a community called Kenwood.  Farrakahn never lived there, he lived in Chatam.  Besides Farrakahn doesn&rsquo;t live in Illinois, he lives in Michigan.</p>

			<p>To the racist black idiot who would dare question the truth from my writings, I state Wikipedia on the racist Farrakhan devil,</p>
<p>Quote from the first paragraph of Louis Farrakhan wikipedia,</p>
<p>Louis Farrakhan (born Louis Eugene Walcott, May 11, 1933), is the acting head of the Nation of Islam (NOI) as the National Representative of Elijah Muhammad. He is also well-known as an advocate for African American interests and a critic of American society. [1][2][3]</p>
<p>Farrakhan has been the center of much controversy, and critics have, among other things, said that some of his views and comments have been racist, homophobic, and antisemitic.[4] Farrakhan denies these charges, and frequently insists that his controversial comments are taken out of context by critics.[5] Farrakhan currently resides in Kenwood, an affluent neighborhood on the south side of Chicago.</p>

			<p>I think if Obama is elected, we will be sending troops to Darfur before we know it, &#8220;To help our brothers and sisters in Africa&#8221; just my opinion.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very bad sign that Michelle Obama&rsquo;s thesis is under lock and key until after the election.  What is she hiding?  What did she write in college that she doesn&rsquo;t want us to see and comment on?  </p>

			<p>Michelle Obama&rsquo;s thesis was released.  Princeton stonewalled it (after all, this was the first time since it was written that anyone had any interest in it   &mdash;   23 years of dust is a lot to wipe off), but the Obama campaign released it.</p>

			<p>Okay, I stand corrected about the release of the thesis; thanks.  I did read it and noticed that it quoted from Stokely Carmichael.  I wonder if most Americans know or care who he was?  Can Amren do us all a favor and put a copy of this thesis on the webpage, or keep liberally applying links to it?</p>
<p>As I recall, Stokely Carmichael was definitely racist&hellip;.. but I&rsquo;m young, so can anyone enlighten me?</p>

			<p>St.Louis and ohers:</p>
<p>I just read it. I really don&rsquo;t see anything all that &#8220;radical &#8221; about it. She was 22 at the time. If anything, I would argue that Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s thesis on Saul Alinsky was more radical. </p>
<p>Now let me make it clear that I would never vote for Barack Obama or any other Black or non-White candidate period. However, it think that some people are making this what I call &#8220;thesisgate&#8221; story more than what it really is.</p>
<p>Much ado about very little.</p>

<p>I agree with you on this one. I hope the republicans and conservatives do not make the mistake of making the campaign about Michelle Obama. Tis will create a backlash from women, Blacks, liberals and independents. Thus, we will lose in November.</p>

<p>Stokely was the head of SNCC (Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee) and was a hate filled Afro- American (pardon the redundancy).<br>
