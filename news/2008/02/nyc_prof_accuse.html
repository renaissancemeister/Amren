<p>The university&rsquo;s Teachers College announced Wednesday it had imposed &#8220;serious sanctions&#8221; against Madonna G. Constantine. The college said a lengthy investigation uncovered numerous instances in which she used others&rsquo; work without attribution in papers she published in academic journals over the past five years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Details of the sanctions were not released, but Horowitz said Constantine was not suspended and will remain a tenured professor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her lawyer, Paul J. Giacomo Jr., said his client can prove her innocence and called the school&rsquo;s investigation &#8220;extremely underhanded from the beginning.&#8221; He said he will appeal the sanctions.</p>

<p>I believe I saw a different article about this story that said that this woman was found to have committed plagarism over 2 dozen times during this 5 year period. Of course, you can&rsquo;t really blame her, African-&#8220;Americans&#8221; come from an oral heritage so they don&rsquo;t understand the proper use of the written word - that argument worked for the liberal professors who defended MLK.<br>

<p>Probably a year&rsquo;s prohibition against plagiarizing. That will be tough on her alright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her lawyer&hellip;hinted the sanctions and noose incident were linked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lawyer may be on to something.</p>

<p>Absolutely! Ms. Constantine probably realized that her plagiarism would eventually come to light. So for the price of a piece of string she created a nice little insurance policy for herself. When confronted she would have this magical &#8220;get out of jail free&#8221; card at her disposal. Who would dare to mention this minor transgression after all she had been thru. </p>
<p>Nice to see that it backfired. Were it not for the notoriety she gained during the &#8220;alleged&#8221; noose incident, this certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be newsworthy. </p>

			<p>You should put up her picture. She looks like she has the IQ of a secretary:90-95. There&rsquo;s no way in hell that she&rsquo;s smart enough to be a full professor in an Ivy League school&hellip; not without racist affirmative action.</p>

			<p>It is not her fault. She is just a loyal follower of her favorite teacher, another professor, Dr. Martin Luther King. It&rsquo;s it.</p>

			<p>Plagiarism occurs so often among blacks that it&rsquo;s quite apparent that the demands placed on them are greater than their abilities can handle.  And that&rsquo;s a result of the political climate in these so-called institutes of higher learning which REQUIRES that a certain number of blacks MUST BE PASSED at all costs.  This large scale cheating is the result of black&rsquo;s trying to do average work, but not having the intelligence nor ability to do it.<br>
  <br>
We only hear of a few cases, but the industry is rife with black incompetents who have a piece of paper that contains meaningless print, because it is not representative of legitimate accomplishment.   </p>
<p>Such are the unintended consequences of affirmative action promotions.  We saw what it has done to the world economy by awarding loans for houses on the bases of race, pushed to the limit to qualify people who oftentimes owed more in mortgage payments every month than they actually earned in wages after the normal rate kicked in, which can rightly be compared to giving someone an AA degree when they did not expend the capital to pay for it, because they just didn&rsquo;t have the capital to do so.</p>
<p>Black incompetence is hurting the country severely, but it is catering to black incompetents by white radicals that will eventually cause an economic meltdown, which we are seeing right now, and/or it will result in humiliating military defeat because of the push to insert unqualified blacks into leasdership positions they should have.</p>
<p>So, the bottom line is that the two greatest hits on a nation that could occur to bring about its downfall are in the process of working themselves out right now.  First the economy, then the military.  Then, of course, erupting into civil upheaval isn&rsquo;t anything to be desired either, and that could well be the consequence of the first two problems that will put the finishing touches on the final degeneration of America.</p>
<p>Political correctness will be written by the historians as having caused the dominoes to begin falling which resulted in our downfall.<br>

<p>Yes, and it will probably a humiliating military defeat of the US government by the American people. </p>
<p>I hope that the liberal social engineers utterly destroy the police and military.</p>
<p>In this case, worse is definitely better.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate an IQ necessary for being a competent secretary. You wouldn&rsquo;t be happy with one having 90-95&hellip;</p>

			<p>A nice little phrase coined by the late, great British comedian Peter Cook, was &#8220;The Bubonic Plagiarist&#8221; - this remark was intially aimed at the TV personality David Frost.</p>

Well it makes sense! When you lower standards so as to hire more blacks you have to lower standards for keeping them! <br>
Total racism!<br>

I think it should be obvious who hung the noose. No ethics, no shame. Fire her! Maybe we need to organize a protest and get this story widely publicized.</p>

			<p>No question; had this been a white male he 1)would never have gotten the position in the first place and 2)he would have been fired on the spot.<br>
The race business clearly has its own set of rules  &mdash;  -one more reason for it to be abolished.</p>

<p>I have to wonder, with so many AA minorities in college these days and government enforced quota hires, are American Universities and Colleges still the best in the world?  I can&rsquo;t believe they would be.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a European University or any other reputable institution of learning, publishing the kind of junk this woman wrote er plagiarized.  <br>

The Toronto Star   &mdash;   the largest newspaper in Canada   &mdash;   had a long-serving literary critic named Ken Adachi, a Japanese-Canadian. In 1989, Mr. Adachi   &mdash;   for reasons known only to himself   &mdash;   took the foolish chance of plagiarizing a book review from Time magazine. </p>
<p>Being from a culture that places a premium on honor and integrity, when his fraud was exposed, Mr. Adachi committed suicide. </p>
<p>I am certainly not recommending that Prof. Constantine do anything as drastic as this. But it is worth pointing out how different are reactions to plagiarism accusations among the various races:</p>
<p>A Japanese is so ashamed as to take his own life. </p>
<p>A Caucasian would either be fired or would resign in disgrace. </p>
<p>A Black denies wrongdoing altogether   &mdash;   attempting instead to shift the blame onto Whites by screaming about how she&rsquo;s the victim of a racist witch-hunt   &mdash;   and is allowed to keep her job.<br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget this was the Teacher&rsquo;s College, not the Physics Department.  Majoring in education, from what I recall from my own recent college experience, is little more than an exercise in the politics of victimization - just a glance at the CV&rsquo;s of the professors should make that clear.  </p>
<p>The scholarly writing is already of such questionable relevance and quality that it is the best place to send an AA hire.  There is no way this could happen in chemistry, biology or even history (plenty of leftist types there, but usually smart ones).</p>
