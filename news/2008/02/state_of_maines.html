						<p><i>Editor&rsquo;s note: The writer is a resident of Eliot, Maine, and a GOP candidate in Maine&rsquo;s 1st Congressional District.</i></p>
<p>One of the great travesties of the Bush administration has been an unwillingness to deal with the crisis of illegal immigration. One of the greatest travesties of the Baldacci administration is an executive order issued in 2004 that has transformed our state into a sanctuary for illegal aliens.</p>
<p>The citizens of Maine and the Legislature were never asked if they approved of such an appalling decision. The governor took it upon himself to devise a plan to welcome illegals to Maine and to force the taxpayers to support them with the vast array of welfare benefits that this state provides. It is no wonder our taxes are so high.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how many illegal aliens are currently in Maine. We do know that we have issued more than 5,300 driver&rsquo;s licenses to people who do not have a Social Security number. We can assume that most, if not all of them, are in the United States illegally. But in the world of illegal immigration, complete with its human smugglers and fake ID industry, it is reasonable to assume that word has spread far and wide that Maine is a sanctuary state that will not only protect illegals, but will give them all the financial benefits of citizenship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is fair to ask how many of these Pakistanis may be terrorist &#8220;sleepers&#8221; who have slipped into Maine and are basking in protected status. Thomas Anderson, a U.S. attorney involved in busting the smuggling rings, put it this way: &#8220;When an organization has established a pipeline to aliens from various countries, including countries with terrorists, into the United States, they don&rsquo;t care who&rsquo;s passing through the pipeline as long as they are paying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under Gov. Baldacci&rsquo;s executive order, state employees are prohibited from inquiring about immigration status when someone applies for state services. That means staffers in a welfare office cannot ask an applicant if he or she is in our country legally. It means that employees at a motor vehicle office cannot ask license applicants if they are U.S. citizens or legal residents. An illegal alien from Pakistan gets exactly the same treatment and level of service as a Mainer whose family has lived here and paid taxes for generations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With the collapse of leadership in Washington, the states are now taking action. They have watched as their hospitals were overrun with nonpaying illegals, as their prisons were packed with illegal alien felons, as their social welfare budgets were wiped out by illegals, and as alien drug gangs eroded their quality of life.</p>
<p>The number of states passing immigration-related bills has skyrocketed this year. No fewer than 1,404 pieces of immigration legislation were introduced in state legislatures during the first half of 2007. All told, 46 states enacted 194 new immigration-related laws in 2007 &mdash; triple the number from the previous year. Maine now remains one of only seven states that continue to issue driver&rsquo;s licenses to people here illegally.</p>

			<p>  As long as Maine does not demand the citizenship and arrest those who do not belong the problem will grow.<br>
  Why do citizens in Maine not sue the state government for malfeasance with state and Federal Funds over providing a situation whihc encourages and pays state tax money to illegal laiens and thereby discriminates on the basis of ethnicity, relgion, race and national orgin AGAINST the CITZENS of Maine and the USA ?<br>
   Criminal charges of misappropriation and aiding and abetting by negligence, plus preventing enforcement of Federal Laws that stick will change the mess in Maine.</p>

			<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have written anything better myself. This local guy in Maine knows what to say - I note the stating of the abuses the illegals do:</p>
<p>Giving drivers licenses to illegals - this is a sure fire winning issue for our side, it works great in California, New York and now Maine.</p>
<p>The writer doesn&rsquo;t dither around with vague, complicated discussion of economics, even thought there are economic issues - he goes right to the heart and soul of the invasion:</p>
<p>the 9/11 Islamic terrorist - let into our country and staying illegally with the intent to murder our people, which they did on 9/11.</p>
<p>The writer comments about Pakistani smugglers, because the public is aware about the chaos and carnage in Muslim Pakistan. The writer doesn&rsquo;t have to state facts that aren&rsquo;t on our side that 98% of illegals are  Mexicans, non Muslims, this GOP candidate in Maine&rsquo;s 1st Congressional District is doing it right, playing to win, not get 2% voter support like the honest, nice, supporters of Ron Paul got in Florida.</p>
<p>Moral of the story:</p>
<p>Campaign on winning issues, use the Muslim terrorist threat, hammer home the truth that illegal immigration is illegal and it will destroy the lives of regular folks.</p>
<p>Work to win.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t winning a lot better than getting 2% and looking like dying old White men who seem to have no clue?</p>

			<p>If Maine doesn&rsquo;t want illegals, then the citizenry should form a civilian army and throw them out, if the &#8220;State&#8221; won&rsquo;t. .This is a vision of the future. WE WILL DO IT OURSELVES!. Leave it to us, and trust me - it won&rsquo;t be done in a gentle manner. Most people are totally FED UP!!</p>

Nonetheless, weren&rsquo;t these the same gullible citizens who just endorsed Obama for president?  The governor didn&rsquo;t do that!   I realize it&rsquo;s  a slightly different issue, but not much.  They get what they deserve. People like that never learn until its too late.</p>

<p>Maine already has a town full of the worst blacks, the  Somalis, in Bangor. Yes, they have gotten what they deserved by now experiencing &#8220;diversity&#8221; first hand.

			<p>&#8220;They have watched as their hospitals were overrun by nonpaying illegals&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Today (Feb.13, 2008) it was announced that a hospital in Lancaster, Texas (South side of Dallas) suddenly closed for good having given no prior announcement or warning.  Its ER was turning away patients and ambulances were pulling up every 20 minutes to load and transfer patients to other hospitals.  The stated reason was that it was broke&hellip;having cared for too many non-paying patients.  I think the name was Medical Center of Lancaster.  This was on the local news at 5 an 6 oclock PM.  I live too far west of Dallas to get the Dallas Morning News.  If I learn more tomorrow, I will let you know.  372 people have lost their jobs there.</p>
<p>Given all of the hospitals that have closed or at least closed their ER rooms in Southern California due to the Mexican invasion, it looks like this issue has spread and has now arrived in Texas.  The sign of things to come in Texas.</p>

			<p>None of us have asked for our nation to be turned from 90% white to this United Nations prototype diversity state.  This was imposed on us by force and with the threat of force.  I&rsquo;m afraid that is the only way it will be undone also.</p>
<p>An interesting listen is this report from the Council on Foreign Relations regarding the Future of North America.  I don&rsquo;t think many at Amren will care for the future they have mapped out for us.</p>

			<p>People can change things.  The great state of Oregon has been over-run by illegals.  The Governor of Oregon, Ted Kulongoski, bows to illegals, he even flew to Seattle to spend time with former president of Mexico, Fox.  He invited Fox to work with him on economic ventures between Oregon and Mexico.  This is illegal for a Governor to do.  The PEOPLE of Oregon got fed up with the pandering.  The formed, oregonir.org.  They are patriots fighting back against the illegals, and the politicians that allow them. They have made a difference.  The Governor seems to have changed his tone a little, and a bill was passed restricting licenses for illegals.  We must all be patriots, and stand up to make a change.</p>

I always thought that Maine had a lot of poor people who lived hand-to-mouth.  I guess Baldacci has proved me wrong. </p>

			<p>  I truly don&rsquo;t understand why the people of Maine haven&rsquo;t started a recall petition to rid themselves of this traitorous governor. For that matter, I don&rsquo;t understand why we haven&rsquo;t impeached Presidente Boosh and his cronies. Believe me, I am not a democrat nor a republican, they both suck. Bill Clinton should have been impeached for signing NAFTA into law, not for being kinky with Monica Lewinsky. George Bush should be impeached for filling this country with iilegals. And Maine&rsquo;s govenor should be impeached for destroying the state of Maine. Especially without the consent of the citizens of Maine.</p>

<p>Even if you will be lucky enough not to be around by then at least pity your poor children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>They will of course be furious at us for not stopping immigration when we had the chance.</p>

			<p>So you didn&rsquo;t ask for the flood of illegals ? Whom did you elect as your governmental leaders ? You get the government you vote for, now live with it. How many of you reading this will ask those running for office how they will deal with the illegal problem ? If they become evasive, be confrontational. Make them cite specifically how they feel and what they will do. If you don&rsquo;t like the answers, don&rsquo;t vote for them. It&rsquo;s your country.</p>

<p>Sort of &#8220;what goes around, comes around&#8221;, I suppose. Maybe after the New England LIBERALS get a &#8220;liberal&#8221; taste of what African Somalis and Mexicans are REALLY like, they&rsquo;ll get a bit smarter. Nothing like becoming a victim of a racially motivated crime to turn a liberal into a thinking conservative.</p>

			<p>I live in the South and I grew up in the South. My perception has always been that Whites in the North were so Liberal and vocal about &#8220;equal rights&#8221; and other Liberal concepts because they didn&rsquo;t have to live in the midst of Blacks. I wonder if their views will change after exposure to non-White cultures?<br>

It&rsquo;s like a plague of trancelike stupidity has decended upon the entire white race. Well, not to worry. The plague will end when all the white homelands are gone, your daughters breed into the dark races, and 1000 years from now future generations of humanity will be sitting around campfires talking about a mysterious race of men who were white but have vanished forever from the face of the earth.</p>

			<p>In case the people or government of any US state hasn&rsquo;t realized this by now: either you pass strict laws against illegal immigrants in your state, no matter HOW far from the Mexican border, or you will be flooded by all the Ricos and Rositas fleeing to escape the law in all the other states. You will in effect become a sanctuary be default.</p>

<p>Yes, worse is better. We need a far larger chunk of the US to suffer the same as us, preferably more areas chock full of ignorant white liberals, more areas where people like the smug 5 O&rsquo;Clock Whistle live. They think people here in CA just sat back. No, the aware people have been fighting the elites who run the war against whites. But we are a small minority, a small bunch of people with nerve. The keyboard warriors like 5 O&rsquo;clock Whistle do nothing but pontificate, and then run when trouble lands on their doorstep. </p>

			<p>Hispanics are taking over this country in a move reminiscent of a well-coordinated military occupation.  They are being coached and financed by the Treason Lobby.  When an advanced scout infiltrates a target community he will rent a two bedroom apartment.  Four bunk beds will be installed in each bedroom and one of their mother&rsquo;s or grandmother&rsquo;s will do their cooking, cleaning and laundry.  She sleeps on the couch.  </p>
<p>In communities containing entire families of illegals they have claimed ownership of fist dibs on all white neighborhoods&rsquo; yard sales.  They send out scouts to cruse the neighborhoods and when one finds a yard sale she calls all her troops via cell phone who all show up within minutes.  They are like vultures and they pick the offerings clean.  What they leave behind not even a Mexican would buy.  This action is synonymous with what these parasites are doing to all our nation&rsquo;s assets and we had best recognize these hostile invaders for what they are and deal with them as such&hellip;   </p>
