<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>LONDON: The Gordon Brown government has reportedly cleared a proposal that will allow husbands with multiple wives to claim extra welfare benefits.</p>
<p>According to the Sunday Telegraph, bigamy is regarded as a crime in Britain and is punishable by up to seven years in prison, but this decision allows for recognition of polygamous marriages so long as such weddings take place in countries where it is legal. Ministers estimate that up to a thousand polygamous partnerships exist in Britain, although they admit there is no exact record.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s Conservative Party has condemned the proposal, accusing the government of offering preferential treatment to a particular group, and of setting a precedent that would lead to demands for further changes in British law.</p>
<p>New guidelines on income support from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) state: &#8220;Where there is a valid polygamous marriage the claimant and one spouse will be paid the couple rate. The amount payable for each additional spouse is presently Â£33.65.&#8221;</p>
<p>Income support for all the wives may be paid directly into the husband&rsquo;s bank account, if the family so chooses. Under the deal, a husband with multiple wives may also be eligible for additional housing benefit and council tax benefit to reflect the larger property needed for his family. The ruling could cost taxpayers millions of pounds.</p>

			<p>The penalty for bigamy is 2 wives. Any moron with more than 1 wife deserves the misery that goes with it. Whether the government sends him money or not, he is toast. Some of my friends (former Westerners) drunkenly talk about having a couple of wives (possible here) but they always wise up with sobriety. This is the difference between the races, they never learn.</p>

			<p>Revolting. I live in Utah and there was a much celebrated arrest of the FLDS leader Warren Jeffs for, among other things, marrying teenage girls. This sort of thing runs rampant in this community which is not related to the better known Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and is punished often. What always gets me is that there are two rather large mosques close to where I live and this sort of thing goes on all the time in the Muslim community. How many news stories are there about busts in the Muslim community for polygamy&hellip; (crickets chirping) Im waiting&hellip;</p>

			<p>It seems Gordon Brown has found a way to encourage black men to marry.  Way to go Gordo.</p>

			<p>I suppose that since these polygamists support all their wives and offspring without placing any burden on the state, never seeking welfare or any other sort of subsidy, they should be able to claim them all as tax deductions, right?  </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s simple - it should be required that immigrants abide by the laws of the land. If any immigrant wants to be part of a polygamous marriage, then they should not move to England or any Western nation! The move by Gordon Brown&rsquo;s government to allow extra welfare payments to these stone-age arrangements is a slap in the face to the citizenry and our moral values and laws. UGH!! This is unbelievable!</p>

<p>Yes, and it makes one wonder why they claim that they brought these people into the country to increase their tax base when imnmigrants cost them more in benefits than what they receive in taxes.</p>
<p>If someone were were a paranoid hater, he could very well conclude that this mass shift of alien cultures into the country was strictly for the purpose of destabalizing the homogeneous population.</p>
<p>But only if one were a &#8220;hater&#8221; or a bigot.  The  more &#8220;enlightened&#8221; progressives know better, because diversity is their strength.</p>
<p>Are you laughing yet?  I am as I write this.</p>

			<p>On the plus side, all those creepy Mormon enclaves in northern Arizona and southern Utah may emmigrate to Britain. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll do just fine in the land of &#8220;do as you please&#8221;.</p>

<p>I never thought I would see the day of such grovelling.</p>
<p>What a shameful pathetic leader.  Leading to disaster.</p>
<p>I wonder which country Gordon Brown will emmigrate to with his millions in payoffs?</p>
<p>Not in your wildest dreams could you ever have imagined such a sellout could be occuring right in front of your noses.</p>

			<p>The Muslims use the ability to be single on paper and have 4 wives drawing welfare, medicaid, section 8 and WIC for a huge brood of children as a way to propagate Islam without even any outside conversion. As far as moving the creepy Mormons to England, they would not qualify, they are all white. </p>

			<p>This sort of thing is madness.  When you reward this behavior you will just get more of it.  Welfare, in general, is like this.  When you reward people for having children they cannot support you just get more of it.  </p>

			<p>This story makes me ashamed to be British. I want to try and defend us from the critisism above, but how can I? We DO deserve to lose our country. The sad truth is, no-one cares about stuff like this, and it will be forgotten in a matter of hours by most that heard it. Only the BNP and the Muslims want Britain, and there are more and more of them every year.</p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t Brussels control the United Kingdom&rsquo;s judiciary system now, not UK any longer! </p>
<p>Has the European Union sanctioned and rubber-stamped this ruling permitting the practice of polygamy in part of her domain?  </p>
<p>If so, does the law apply equally to <b>all</b>?  By that I mean, women being permitted to have multiple husbands, Mormons, multiple wives and gays, multiple same-sex marriage partners. </p>
<p>If not, why not?  It&rsquo;s racial, gender, religious and homophobic discrimination otherwise and the perpetrators of such crimes have got to be prosecuted in the Courts. Indeed, they have!<br>

			<p>Why the surprise? This is from a government that invites the extremist &#8220;gay-rights&#8221; organisation, Stonewall, to shape social policy, with the result that there is every likelihood that children as young as 4 in the state education [sic] system will soon be taught that same-sex relationships are every bit as normal as stable, heterosexual marriages (indeed, probably rather more so).</p>

			<p>I give up on the UK! Their government continues to cater to immigrants who treat them like dirt. UK citizens are no longer even safe to board buses without taking the risk of being victims of African happy slappers, who mock them on with their quasi British accents, which sound disgusting. I do not blame the people, but their government is a joke.</p>

I understand there are some nice estates available in the Bahamas and Barbados, for not too many millions.   Bermuda is very nice too    &mdash;    for the very rich.  <br>
He will have a lovely retirement!</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
I wouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about her or what she would think.  She wasn&rsquo;t a thinking person.  She certainly was no Catherine the Great, nor Elizabeth the First.   She was a  basically kind, but very ignorant woman, with no special intelligence or understanding of the world, who allowed her country be taken over and run  by others who had their own agendas to serve.  She hadn&rsquo;t a clue as to what was going on. The rot didn&rsquo;t actually begin under her rule, it started long before,  but it certainly shifted into high gear.  Although Britain reached its peak under her, that wasn&rsquo;t through any doing of hers.  She rode the crest of empire that had been  built by the sweat and blood of many others,  and she was really the beginning of the end. It would have been difficult to see it at the time.</p>
<p>How odd that Britons today revere personages like Churchill and Victoria, when these contributed nothing to its greatness but only led to its downfall!   Yet they get the credit, not the blame.  Bizarre!  Well, they were good for some. But not for the British.<br>
