						<p>Spain&rsquo;s Socialist government on Thursday said opposition calls for immigrants to learn Spanish and respect Spanish customs were xenophobic, raising immigration issues ahead of next month&rsquo;s national election.</p>
<p>Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy said on Wednesday immigrants should sign a legally binding contract promising to integrate into Spanish society, a move compared here to plans backed by President Nicolas Sarkozy in France.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&rsquo;s going to say which customs are right or not?&#8221; Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said at a news conference, calling the proposals &#8220;smoke with a whiff of xenophobia&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rajoy said immigrants would have to leave the country if they cannot find work after a year and will be expelled if they commit crimes. The end of a building boom is leaving Spain with a large population of unemployed foreigners for the first time.</p>
<p>Both major parties favour continuing immigration into Spain, and neither wants to see any reduction. The majority of economic immigrants are Moroccans, Latin Americans and Eastern Europeans.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose party is leading polls, said Rajoy&rsquo;s proposals were unnecessary and pointed to his own efforts to expel illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the past year-and-a-half we have been making a great effort on repatriation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Immigration is a recent phenomenon in Spain, with an explosion in economic growth in the first half of the decade pushing the number of foreign residents to over 4 million for the first time in 2006, or about 9 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Although the influx has not heightened tensions to the degree seen in other Western European countries with high levels of foreign residents, Spaniards regularly rank &#8220;immigration&#8221; as one of their main worries in opinion polls.</p>
<p>The PP&rsquo;s stance could set a dangerous precedent in the election campaign, said Mauricio Valiente, spokesman of the Spanish Commission for Help for Refugees.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s trying to present a tough image against immigration, associating it with criminality. It&rsquo;s a dangerous argument,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>During the Franco years, when Spain was poor, many Spaniards went abroad to work in France.  There, the workers were &#8220;worked on&#8221; by the socialist labor union organizers, and even by Marxist priests who were assigned to work among the immigrants and guest-workers. They got drenched in Marxism.  When they later returned home with their savings, they took back their new communist/socialist ideology along with them. It was anathema in Spain at the time.</p>
<p>Today, we see the outcome of this in the generation of their children who are now running Spain like any good French socialist would approve. Job well done! </p>

<p>The &#8220;whiff&#8221; appears to be pot smoke that the Interior Minister might privately be inhaling. If immigrants can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t assimilate into the host country, they simply DO NOT BELONG THERE AND SHOULD BE DEPORTED! Lest they be a perpetual social problem and pose an unending disruptive presence in that country!</p>

<p>Here we see the effect of 60+ years of Cultural Marxism.  Mr. Rubalcaba is submitting himself (and Spain&rsquo;s culture) to immigrants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely Mr. Rubalcaba truly believes what he says, making him the ideal &#8220;useful idiot&#8221; for the Marxist elite who run this world.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
Not meaning  to be picky, but I have to correct you on this.  Moroccans are NOT descended from Spaniards -  not from Spaniards of  <i>any </i> kind.  </p>
<p>True, some moriscos were expelled and went to Morocco (mainly the ruling class was deported, not the peasants who were needed for agriculture), but do you think there was nobody in Morocco before that?   And many of those moriscos already had Moorish blood anyway, after eight centuries of Islamic rule   &mdash;   especially those upper class members who had collaborated and  &#8220;fitted in&#8221; with their Arab rulers.   The number of morisco exiles from Spain would have been a very tiny percentage in the Moroccan population, and mostly concentrated in the extreme north at that (across from Spain).</p>
<p>No, Moroccans are not Spaniards.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
Yes, it seems surreal.   But it&rsquo;s real, Bobby!  When I was last in Madrid, several years ago, I found the Madrid Central Library having a big exposition or book  festival in honor of Susan Sontag. (She had recently died.)  The government of Spain had awarded her the Prince of Asturias Prize, Spain&rsquo;s highest literary honor.  [He&rsquo;s Spain&rsquo;s equivalent of the Prince of Wales.]  There were free booklets, and readings,  and banners strewn above the street with her name and quotations from her works.  To see the way she was being  feted there, you would think she was the greatest American thinker and author of the Twentieth Century.  Probably they think she was.  She gets much greater acclaim abroad than she does here.</p>
<p>Of course, she was a Marxist, needless to say, so it&rsquo;s all political.  Marxists always praise and celebrate their own. It&rsquo;s the same with Nobel Prize winners today. You have to be a lefty to win.  If not, you haven&rsquo;t a chance.</p>
<p>Remember,  this  Sontag is the same  person who famously described the white race as &#8220;the cancer of history&#8221;.  Is it any wonder that those brainwashed left-wingers who now run Spain are eager to import more of those wonderful, &#8220;vibrant&#8221; Third Worlders   &mdash;    to water down some of that shameful, cancerous whiteness that Europe is cursed with?   </p>
<p>This would explain people like Rubalcaba  and &#8220;where they come from.&#8221;  And who motivates them. Have they been hypnotized, you ask?   Well, something not far from it.</p>

			<p>Susan Sontag was more than a Marxist. You&rsquo;re glossing over too much here. She knew what was happening, and she was one of those helping to make it happen.</p>

			<p>How come us whites in the West are &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; for wanting our native language, customs, and race to be dominant in our lands?  Why are other races not worried about whether or not they&rsquo;re &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;bigots&#8221;?  When will whites get some pride and their collective racial spines back?  Oh!  That&rsquo;d first require the young white men to act like men, be patriotic and have more babies.  </p>

			<p>H.G. Wells,  a devout Marxist, wrote non-fiction books as well like The New World Order and The Open Conspiracy.  His other &#8220;science fiction&#8221; books, like The Time Machine and War of the Worlds, are just well disguised blueprints of the future - our very near future.</p>

			<p>The comments at 11:21PM about the Eloi, in H.G. Wells&rsquo;s time machine woke me up. I swear, the Eloi are reflective of both many Americans and Europeans, when it comes to taking control of what is happening to them in their own societies. I read this book many times as a youth and was impressed by it. In support of my beliefs,a buddy of mine just came back from visiting with a tour group, Germany,France,Austria,and Switizerland. He told me that the Europeans he met, were all very nice people, but were utterly brainwashed by liberal ideas and essentially had an open society socialist bent. One example he gave me was an Austrian fellow he met in Vienna, who was ticked off because the California Governor Arnold S., an Austrian by birth, signed Tookie William&rsquo;s death sentence. He felt sorry for poor &#8220;Tookie&#8221;.</p>

I think that&rsquo;s an excellent analysis.  Thanks.  We need more perceptive comments like that and less helpless whining about  our sad condition.   One thing I must grant the extreme left  (and especially those who fund and abet them): they have a good sense of history. They take the long-term view. Their goals are not for this year, or this election, nor the next. They are patient, and willing to wait and  work for many decades to achieve their goals.  Even a lifetime or lifetimes. The things we are seeing coming to pass today were planned and placed on &#8220;the agenda&#8221; many years ago by today&rsquo;s leftists&rsquo;  grandparents.  They have  <i>planned, </i> and the right has not.  Meanwhile, the  &#8220;loony fringe of the free-market right&#8221; (so well put!) continues milling around in confusion and cannot see past the next election or the next corporate annual report. No wonder halfwits like the present puppet in the White House have zero compresantion of history and have never read a book. Those in charge like it that way.</p>

Arnold S., an Austrian by birth, signed Tookie William&rsquo;s death sentence. He felt sorry for poor &ldquo;Tookie&rdquo;.<br>

Your friend told you right.  Bad as Americans are, Europeans are worse, as far as the brainwashing goes. They&rsquo;re just farther down the road than we are.  Some part of their brains has been paralyzed and cannot think logically.  Nice people who cannot see their own self-interest. </p>
<p>Poor Tookie, indeed!   And Mumia too, another big hero! In France they&rsquo;ve even named a street for him.</p>

			<p>Socialists are the most rabid Utopian dreamers there are&hellip;next to Democrats in the USA, voting for &lsquo;change.&rsquo;<br>

Yes, I notice those misguided white simpletons and &#8220;useful idiots&#8221; cheering at Obama rallies,  enthusiastically waving their signs for &#8220;Change&#8221;.  (What change?)</p>
<p>&#8220;Rapid utopian dreamers&#8221; .. that puts it very well.  Beware those with good intentions for you!</p>
<p>&#8220;Change&#8221; is simple-minded babble that appeals to the brainwashed who don&rsquo;t have to think.   Just like &#8220;yes we can!&#8221;    Can what?   </p>
<p>&#8220;Change&#8221; is a subtle code-word that real leftists understand, and so do we, but which slips past 95% of starry-eyed white liberals who think they&rsquo;re making a better world and have all the best intentions.  Instead, they being used to dig their own graves.  Do they have no idea at all what they&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to confront some of those do-gooder housewives and students from small-town Nebraska and North Dakota and ask them, &#8220;Exactly WHAT type of &#8216;change&rsquo; do you have in mind?  Can you be <i> EXPLICIT?&#8221;    </i> The word sounds good, but they&rsquo;ve probably never given it two seconds of thought.   They&rsquo;ll only  wake when it&rsquo;s too late. That&rsquo;s generally the case, as history proves</p>

			<p><i>How come us whites in the West are &ldquo;racist&rdquo; and &ldquo;xenophobic&rdquo; for wanting our native language, customs, and race to be dominant in our lands? Why are other races not worried about whether or not they&rsquo;re &ldquo;racist&rdquo; or &ldquo;bigots&rdquo;?</i></p>
<p>Good questions.</p>
<p>If ever you&rsquo;re in an argument with an immigrant and he calls you a racist for not wanting to allow him to bring in millions more of his people, ask him these questions:</p>
<p>1) How multiracial is your home country?</p>
<p>In the rare case the answer is &#8220;yes,&#8221; continue on:</p>
<p>2) Is it a prosperous and desireable place to live?<br>
3) Is it free and democratic?</p>
<p>If the answer is no, ask him:</p>
<p>4) Would you be willing to take in immigrants to the point where the native population became a racial/religious/political minority?</p>
<p>If he says &#8220;Sure, no big deal, then ask him: </p>
<p>5) Would you answer that question while connected to a polygraph?</p>
<p>Of course, maybe he would. Remember, the first thing so many Hispanics and blacks do when they get enough money is move out of their neighborhood and into a white one. Even they find living amonst whites more tolerable than living amongst their own. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m beginning to think the Spanish were better off under Franco.&#8221;<br>

That depends.<br>
Economically, they weren&rsquo;t.  But racially, they were.</p>

  Yes, but that&rsquo;s just my point here. There are higher values then economics. And there are some things that you can&rsquo;t measure with money. Would most AmReners accept a 5% decline in the standard of living to live in a 100% homogeneous country? Would you accept a 5% increase in your personal wealth if it meant the English language was extinguished in the U.S. and a foreign tongue substituted? Let&rsquo;s suppose there were two small cities of 100,000. One all-White, another Non-White. You can live in the non-White city and make $3,000 more a year. Would it be worth it? What about cultural and social isolation? Isn&rsquo;t that worth something? There are so many ways in which homogeneity are a  benefit but it is hard to quantify into dollars and cents. I would argue that the Spanishness of Spain IS WORTH SOMETHING. It is a value, an asset, even if it can&rsquo;t be sold like a commodity or raw material. </p>

Yes. And my point too. Most definitely!  We fully agree.</p>
<p>But go tell that to our government.   I should say our governments, which all seem to be run by businessmen and bankers, concerned only with &#8220;the bottom line&#8221; and profits. They see nothing else.   </p>
<p>Of course, race is now completely unmentionable. And even defense of your national culture and language are becoming a delicate, nervous topic, in this age that celebrates multi-culture and diversity.</p>
