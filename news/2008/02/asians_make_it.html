						<p>Immigrants from Southeast Asia &mdash; and the Philippines in particular &mdash; integrate into the Canadian economy better than any other group, while those from Africa fare the worst, according to a new Statistics Canada study.</p>
<p>The study surveyed 650,000 immigrant households in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia in 2006, and looked at three different groups: Those in the country for less than five years, from five to 10 years, and more than 10 years.</p>
<p>The survey showed that no matter how long someone from Southeast Asia was in Canada they managed to secure work and stay employed longer than any other group. The study also showed that immigrants from Africa had an unemployment rate four times higher than immigrants from the Philippines.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;About 99% of Filipinos working in Canada are fluent in English,&#8221; Gilmore said. &#8220;We also know that 80% of the Filipino workforce have a post-secondary diploma or a post-secondary degree, a figure higher than the national Canadian-born average, which is at about 60%.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FAMILIES DEPEND ON THEM</p>
<p>&#8220;English is the medium of instruction in the Philippines from grade school up to the college level and so this helps people to integrate,&#8221; Brillantes said, adding that the motivation to work is often tied to responsibilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Filipinos know they cannot afford to slip up because they have the survival of their families back home to think about.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Because refugees are under such strain they do not always have all of their credentials with them, it is hard to track down their references and those things can make it harder for them to find work,&#8221; Gilmore said [Jason Gilmore, an analyst with StatsCan and author of the report].</p>

			<p>Sooner than you think you won`t be able to find Maple Syrup or Hockey sticks  at the souviener shops. Beaver pelts, I don`t know&hellip; Maybe some cultures consider them a delicacy!?!</p>

			<p>Africans seem to be too lazy to look for or maintain a job. Here in the US so many of them seem to land high paying but low responsibility State and Federal government jobs. I was actually told that due to affirmative action I should not even bother applying for a State job in California because I would not even make it past the first cut due to race. </p>

			<p>Clearly the Africans are not doing well because of the long history of racism going back to when the Canadians owned slaves to work on their cotton plantations.</p>
<p>Uh..sorry&hellip; wrong excuse; let me think of another one.</p>

			<p>Canada like the US are well on the way to third world status.</p>
<p>Remember how the Japanese fought kamikaze style in the second world war, now they are welcomed.</p>

			<p>The analyst is practically bending over backwards to explain away the African difference as no fault of their own.</p>

			<p>The Canadian governments solution to this problem will certainly be to change immigration laws and not allow so many educated Asians into the country, they learned this from the politicans in America.</p>

			<p>Anytime blacks live around whites and they fail, it&rsquo;ll always be blamed on whites.  They always find a way.  I&rsquo;d ask, exactly WHICH whites are holding you back?  Are you saying that every white person on the face of the planet wakes up every morning to hold back black people or make their life a living hell?</p>

			<p>Immigration policies SHOULD be guided by this: Don&rsquo;t bring in races/cultures who on average create problems for your society and are failures. Only allow races/cultures that are successful, contribute positively to your society, and are compatible.</p>
<p>As a general rule,<br>
Incompatible: Blacks<br>
Compatible: Everyone else</p>
