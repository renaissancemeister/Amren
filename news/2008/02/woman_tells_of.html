						<p>RALEIGH &mdash; The 36-year-old woman cried on the witness stand in the Wake County Courthouse on Wednesday, recalling the night more than eight years ago when she said a man broke into her Raleigh apartment and raped her.</p>
<p>The woman testified during the first day of the criminal trial of James Bernard Henderson, a Georgia man who was named as a suspect last year in the September 1999 crime when a DNA match led police to him. She is not being named in line with a News &amp; Observer policy not to identify those who report sexual assaults.</p>
<p>Henderson, 41, is facing felony charges of first-degree forcible rape, first-degree burglary, first-degree kidnapping and first-degree forcible sexual offense.</p>
<p>He faces more than 90 years in prison if he is convicted of all those charges, according to court records and Superior Court Judge Henry W. Hight Jr.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I woke up to a vision of a man coming into my apartment with a gun,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The woman also told jurors Henderson repeatedly said he was attacking her because her forefathers raped and enslaved his ancestors. The woman is white, and Henderson is black.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see why this lady should be punished because her forefathers were reckless enough to introduce an entirely inappropriate race to this continent.  </p>
<p>At any rate, Mr Henderson&rsquo;s simply living in this country is punishment enough, for whites that is.  (As is his use of an Anglo-Saxon surname.)</p>

			<p>If and when this country collapses, the aftermath will see an end to black on white rape.  Or the trees will be full of hanging rapists.  It is just law.  And only a nation run by bolsheviks who themselves were rapists, would ever allow this to happen to our people. I hope this black racist gets the death penalty.  </p>

			<p>Okay, so his DNA was found on/in her, presumably during a rape-kit swab following the incident.</p>
<p>So what kind of trial is this man entitled to?  Either they had consensual sex, or he raped her.  That&rsquo;s the (sole) issue.  </p>
<p>And yes, I am an attorney, by the way, and no, I don&rsquo;t think &#8220;justice&#8221; is ever - EVER - found in an American criminal court. </p>

<p><p>Yes, a surprising number of black felons are amateur genealogists: they meticulously research who the forefathers of their white victims were before they make their move to rob or rape or murder.  These men have far too many scruples to attack someone innocent of their ancestors&rsquo; enslavement.</p></p>

			<p> If this man repeatedly told his victim that he was assaulting her because of slavery   &mdash;   in essence, because she is White   &mdash;   then why wasn&rsquo;t he charged with a hate crime? Does anyone think for a minute that a White man who raped a black woman while telling her that he was doing it because she was black, would NOT be charged with a hate crime?</p>
<p> I wonder if this prosecutor might be black; or if he or she is just another weak-kneed White liberal who didn&rsquo;t have the moxie to file such a charge where it was obviously warranted. And didn&rsquo;t it occur to the reporter who wrote the story to at least ask the prosecutor about that?</p>

			<p>The idea that black females, to a greater extent than women generally, chase the &#8220;big man&#8221; and found white slaveholder &#8220;big men&#8221; perfectly agreeable probably doesn&rsquo;t sit well with black males.  Thus the rape narrative is the only narrative allowed - well, except the ridiculous narrative of the wealthy southern slaveholder&rsquo;s wife riddled with jungle fever.</p>

			<p>As no race-conscious white could miss, the article does not contain the word &#8220;hate,&#8221; much less the phrase &#8220;hate crime&#8221;; this implies that not only will hate crime charges not be tacked on, but also that the author doesn&rsquo;t even consider it an issue (and, by logical extension, doesn&rsquo;t think the term can even be applied to black perpetrators).</p>

			<p>So let me figure this out&hellip; American blacks say the ancient Egyptians were black like them.  I&rsquo;m Jewish and my ancestors were enslaved by the ancient Egyptians.  That must mean I have the right to rape black women (assuming I wanted to).</p>

			<p>Hello Mr. Bush&hellip;the defendant here ought to tighten up one of those nooses that you and your friend Rev. Sharpton are so upset about. Only CONSPIRACY can explain why this atrocity only receives notice on sites like amren. I would not be surprised if &#8220;civil rights leaders&#8221; fly in like buzzards to the courthouse to condemn this brave young woman&rsquo;s testimony as &#8220;hate speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>I understand that the accused rapist&rsquo;s lawyer has defamed this woman on the stand.</p>
<p>Any &#8220;conservatives&#8221; out there still see fit to support this regime?</p>

			<p>If you might have read any of the books by Herbert Asbury published in the 1920s and 1930s one of the things he never mentioned about how things occured during the slave era. Rape of black women by white slve owners never occured.There was a firm belief by blacks that during steamboat races slaves were used as an alternative fuel for a little extra horsepower.So I guess blacks will believe anything you tell them.</p>

<p>This is a classic excuse to distract victims from the fact that a lot of criminals are criminals because they want to be criminals.  Not because of some past wrong done to them.</p>
<p>I suspect that criminals of all colors have psychotic tendencies, even if they do not qualify as fully psychotic.</p>
<p>I mean psychotic in the anti-social, ruthlessly self serving sense, not the Hollywood/T.V. version that just kills and gets killed.</p>

			<p>The truth is that the Civil Rights movement was about one thing, and one thing only.  As we all know it was getting black men the power to have sex with white women. </p>
<p>If you offered black men everything they claim they want, high paying jobs, or no jobs at all just a lot of money, the best houses free, all the clothes and jewelry they could wear free, a free Cadillac or any car they wanted, unlimited drugs of any kind free; but the only thing they can&rsquo;t have is a white women, they would turn down the deal in a flash.   </p>
<p>MLK is a perfect example.  A better one is OJ.  He had all the above, except his white woman.  You know the rest.  <br>

			<p>  It is more than probable that Mr. Henderson<br>
Learned his &#8220;history&#8221; in our educational system, or perhaps through viewing the mini-series Roots.  I recall that the author, Alex Haley, has been accused of plagiarism. However, even Haley began to feel that whites had been too vilified in the television series. Unfortunately, Henderson is not alone in his opinions. <br>

			<p>A rare opportunity for pure justice has passed now that this trial is underway.  The trial is at a venue a mere 23 miles away from Duke University.  The Duke Gang of 88, The Duke Female Sexual Health Board, as well as President Richard Brodhead and the remainder of the upper level Duke administrators should have been forced by The Hand of God to sit through this whole thing from day one.</p>

			<p>If I have this pathetic excuse straight, people who were never slaves have the right to torment and abuse people who never owned slaves.</p>
<p>I wonder if it has ocurred to Henderson that if his ancestors had not been brought here as slaves, they would not have been brought here at all.  Does anyone imagine whites would have imported shiploads of Africans merely because they&rsquo;s so much fun to have around?</p>

			<p>Wonder if the ADL will consider a hate crime attached to his sentence? We are going to see in the very near future more violence directed at Whites and they will get away with it, as partial &#8220;reparation&#8221; payments&hellip;..White are not going to wake up. They should have 40 years ago. In fact, I see more Whites all the time who have bought into the &#8220;we are evil and racist&#8221; and should not expect blacks to be civilized or obey White man&rsquo;s laws&hellip;.Blacks are a hopeless cause and now Whites seem to becoming a hopeless cause&hellip;.. </p>

			<p>Whites should always bear in mind that many blacks will always have &#8220;payback&#8221; an an agenda for whites, and the passage of time will not diminish this to the slightest degree.They are always so eager to get revenge, for real or imaginary slights. And they are willing to project their anger and hate to whatever target is the easiest mark, or to anyone that they are capable of victimizing.</p>

			<p>i&rsquo;m not a big supporter of &#8220;hate crime&#8221; legislation because it leaves too much room for abuse and manipulation by politically motivated prosecutors. i do, however, think crime can be motivated by hatred. clearly this was such a case. but i doubt henderson will be charged with a hate crime, which only goes to show that &#8220;hate crime&#8221; legislation IS being abused and manipulated by politically motivated prosecutors.</p>

			<p>I could suggest a number of ways to halt the epidemic of black-on-white rape. Of course, they&rsquo;re all violent, messy, and politically incorrect. Needless to say, no such measures will be taken. Actually, I expect that rape in reprisal for slavery will become a new black right during the reign of emporer Obama.</p>

<p>But whenever this happens, don&rsquo;t you all also just hope that the white victim of black social rage is a humanitarian worker for social justice and feels all guilty for her white privilege and is ready to sacrifice her diginity and the educations of her children in the name of Multicultural Diversity?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you hope that she is a member of some commission for racial reconciliation and healing?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you hope that she is a college professor in the social sciences department and sits on the Multicultural Diversity advisory committee to the Admissions Office?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you hope that whitey people who hate their ancestors and themselves get more and more of this African justice?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you hope the all the social justice workers will move their family into the ghettos and start learning about Africanus Socialitus?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Thus the rape narrative is the only narrative allowed - well, except the ridiculous narrative of the wealthy southern slaveholder&rsquo;s wife riddled with jungle fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly. If whites had been having massive sex with black women during the slave era, the outcome would have been numerous half white/black people yet such people then were uncommon. </p>

			<p>This is why I blame the liberals for black on white violence: they never let up about the past, filling black heads with all sorts of hatred.  A couple of months ago there was a story here about a woman prevented from sitting on a bus by students and then viciously attacked.  What are the odds they had just had a lesson about Rosa Parks?  </p>

Nor did any of loca television stations. In particular the Wral (ral is short for Raleigh) does not have this story on their web site. Of course it did carry a daily blow by blow account of the Duke Lacrosse case.</p>

			<p>The rape of white women in my country as &#8216;revenge&rsquo; for apartheid happens quite frequently. The motivation for the criminal is initially robbery, and then as an afterthought the white victim is raped by the black perp as &#8216;revenge&rsquo; for &#8216;wrongs&rsquo; committed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He faces more than 90 years in prison if he is convicted of all those charges, according to court records and Superior Court Judge Henry W. Hight Jr.&#8221;</p>
<p>I, for one, do not see the logic of taxing law-abiding citizens for 90 years (if he were to live that long) for such a HATE CRIME as rape in &#8216;reparation&rsquo; for slavery.</p>
<p>The biblical command for the elders of the town to stone such a one, is transmitted in this day and age into the death penalty.</p>
<p>Such is the only &#8216;humane&rsquo; way to rid society of such a criminal, and not make us (and this poor traumatized woman) &#8216;pay&rsquo; for HIS crime, HIS hate, HIS evil.</p>

AmRen readers who keep up with the deteriorating situation in &#8220;The New South Africa&#8221; [TM] should be familiar with the concept of the Revenge Rape. After the country was handed over the ANC, violent crime rates increased across the board   &mdash;   but no crime category exploded more dramatically than (black-on-white) sexual assault. </p>
<p>Revenge Rape is, to some (certainly not all) black men, just another form of &#8220;reparations.&#8221; To their tiny, twisted minds, unfettered sexual access to white women   &mdash;   willing or not   &mdash;   is something that is &#8220;owed&#8221; to them. <br>

			<p>So let me figure this out&hellip; American blacks say the ancient Egyptians were black like them. I&rsquo;m Jewish and my ancestors were enslaved by the ancient Egyptians. That must mean I have the right to rape black women (assuming I wanted to).</p>

			<p>I have always opposed hate crime legislation and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>What a criminal says to me while commiting a felony against me does not merit more or less punishment. I really do not give a flip what they say. And yet that is ALL we have to go by, when trying to guess at what motivated them to do the crime. It does not make me feel any better if the motivation was purely mercenary. Love of money is the root of all evil but the criminal who commits crimes while pointing out the obvious racial differences between us (in a loud voice with other profanities) is not any worse.</p>
<p>The revenge motive for rape is something we need to clarify very quickly&hellip;.it is a false excuse. Every Prince of Africa knows the white man did not invent slavery nor did he enslave Africans. Slaves were taken by other Africans, who sold them to white traders visiting the coasts. To say otherwise is nonsense. The slaves were already slaves when they were bought and paid for. Those doing the selling became wealthy and those tribes are still in Africa. You want reparations for slavery, take it up with the people who enslaved your ancestors and still have the money.</p>
<p>What happened in my lifetime in South Africa was one of the worst betrayals in the world. It is also one of the most important lessons&hellip;.NEVER SURRENDER&hellip;.regarless of the odds. It would be far preferable to burn the Earth into vast plains of black glass than to surrender Western Civilization. We need to match our will and resolve with our destructive abilities.<br>

			<p>Blacks get away with what the Elites of this nation want them to. The Elites want the majority of whites to be forced permanently beneath them, and they achieve that best with using the power of government to elevate blacks.<br>
 <br>
You add that use of power, a small group of whites playing nasty socio-economic war against the majority of whites, to the now more than two centuries old legacy of Yankees romanticizing blacks as perfect creatures if only slavery (and then Jim Crow) were ended, and what you are going to have crammed down your throat is what is in South Africa today.</p>
<p>As bad as they are now, black on white rapes and murders are just going to get worse - until the system erected by the Elites caves in on itself. At that point, those who can and will use guns can protect themselves, provided they have enough family and friends. Because it is a given that blacks and mestizos will gang and go wild at the drop of a hat.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;payback&#8221; terminology is frightening and misleading.  If black-on-white rape were payback, the crime of slavery would have been paid back long ago.  Cleaver and Baraka have been advocating payback rape for decades, and their minions have dutifully obeyed, but the complaints about slavery haven&rsquo;t stopped.  Anyone who hasn&rsquo;t visited <br>

			<p>Why isn&rsquo;t this being treated as a racially motivated HATE CRIME? Where is the FBI and FEDERAL HATE CRIME charges?<br>
The truth is that racial comments and slurs is COMMON during the ONE MILLION acts of black on white violence EACH YEAR in the US today, 12 times the reverse (including the rape of 30,000 white women, 8000 gang raped, while the reverse is nearly non-existent). As such, if the same standards were applied in black on white crimes as the much rarer white on black, hate crime stats would show that racially motivated hate crimes are almost exclusively committed by blacks against non-blacks. But there is a double standard whereby blacks can only be victims, never perpetrators of hate crimes.<br>
There are something like 100 or more black on white rapes to each ONE white on black rape. AND THE BLACK RAPISTS ALMOST ALWAYS MAKE RACIAL COMMENTS AND USE RACIAL SLURS AGAINST THEIR WHITE VICTIMS. (A rare opportunity to see what typically transpires during black on white rapes, for instance, was seen when the Des Moines Register invited any rape victim willing, to come forward and tell her story: A white lady, Nancy Ziegenmeyer, attacked by a black man, came forward. Throughout her long terrifying ordeal as she was raped and sodomized by her black attacker, he referred to her as a &ldquo;white b***h&rdquo; and made numerous other anti-white racial comments. Yet this was never treated by the media or law enforcement as a hate crime. And the racial motivation was censored from the subsequent made-for-TV movie based on the event.) </p>

<p>Welcome, and thanks for posting.<br>
________________________________________________________________<br>
 You know, this story reminds me of just how badly the Feminist Movement has discredited itself.  After all of those years of fighting for freedom from the drudgery of the Housewife (not without some justification, but only some) they turned their backs on their own when ever they were unlucky enough to have been raped by a PC-favored group (Blacks) or a group who was not exactly favored, but a group that at least was an enemy of their enemies (Muslims fit this one nicely).  Of course, by now, the Muslims have become a PC-favored group.</p>
<p>Speaking of reminders. Whenever I see a post from someone announcing that they are new I always welcome them for two reasons.  1- it&rsquo;s polite.  2- it keeps the memory fresh in my mind when I first started posting here.  It wasn&rsquo;t that long ago, May of last year.  AR scared me a bit.  I felt like I had really crossed some line.  And I did.  By the way, I&rsquo;m speaking for myself here.  But the line I crossed was the fear I felt, even when alone in my room in front of the computer and using a fake name. It felt good to come out of hiding, well, sort of, and begin to share my thougts on this issue and related issues without any shame.</p>
<p>Man do I feel a change.  So different from even last May.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with Mr. Taylor all of the time.  And though it&rsquo;s important to give any idea, or movement, etc. a public face, it&rsquo;s even more important, in my view, to put principles before personalities.  </p>
<p>For myself the two things I admire most about Mr. Taylor is that he walks the talk.  More specifically, he models Democratic values.  And two, his commitment to Reality.  As in Race REALISM.  </p>
<p>Anyway, my differences with him, or any of the posters here, and no doubt theirs with mine, is healthy and points to a geniune diversity.  Not the candy-coated, toxic deversity of the Politically Correct, whose belief-system is specificaly designed to protect their fragile psyche&rsquo;s from the unpleasant facts of an unyeilding reality.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;d wager that the victim&rsquo;s forefathers had nothing to do with enslaving and raping black women. This is just another smoke screen to help get this bastard out of his just punishment. If he&rsquo;s that emotionally scarred due to something that may have or may never have happened more than a century ago, then perhaps suicide would be the answer to the intense historical pain that he&rsquo;s feeling and a more humane alternative to 90 years encarceration.  After all, we all know how sensitive, caring and nurturing the average black sociopath is.  It&rsquo;s evident from the &#8220;music&#8221; to which they listen. <br>

			<p>A black man claims he has the right to rape white women because of slavery!?</p>
<p>Here is this contrast.  There are about 100,000 Jews living in Germany today, with still growing numbers.  Despite the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust, there does not exist in Germany, Jews who rape German women and claim they have the right to do so because the Holocaust.  Unlike post-Apartheid South Africa, Germans do not need to have barbed wire, electronic devices, and other security methods around their houses, and still live in fear that Jews will break into their homes and kill them.  Germans do not have to fear Jew-on-German crimes being committed against them, the way there are black-on-white crimes in the USA and South Africa.</p>
<p>The most that Jews have done to post WW11 Germany is to demand that Germany pay financial reparations and abslolutely not forget the Holocaust, very reasonable and understandable.  If I was a South African white man, I would envy the Germans because of the way that is the most Jews have done about post WW11 Germany.</p>
<p>Today, many of the Germans who have a deep remorse over the Holocaust, are themselves descendents of WW11 Nazis.  If the Jews living in Germany today, committed crimes against Germans because the Holocaust, the way blacks in the USA do because of slavery, and as black South Africans do to white South Africans because of Apartheid, how long do you think that the German nation of today would remain being regretful over the Nazi Holocaust!?</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;I recall that the author, Alex Haley, has been accused of plagiarism. However, even Haley began to feel that whites had been too vilified in the television series&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Sardonicus at 7:14 PM on February 14 </p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t ever heard about Haley feeling guilty about �?Whites being vilified&rsquo;  &mdash;  if you have a source, I&rsquo;d like to add it to my Black Fraud arsenal.</p>
<p>Indeed Alex Haley (and MLK) were frauds and plagiarizers whose mis-deeds, instead of being covered up or outright ignored, should be Common Knowledge, exposed and made examples of.</p>
<p>From Jack Cahill, author of Hoodwinked  &mdash;  a book I highly recommend to one and all:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Approaching 70 when &#8220;Roots&#8221; debuted, Harold Courlander was shocked to read it. For the previous 30 years or more, Courlander had been traveling the world collecting folk tales and writing about his findings. </p>
<p>In 1978, Courlander sued Haley in a U.S. District Court in New York for copyright infringement. The suit cited 81 passages that had been lifted from Courlander&rsquo;s &#8220;The African,&#8221; as well as the plot and certain characters. Haley&rsquo;s defense fell apart when, during discovery, the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyers found three quotes from &#8220;The African&#8221; among his typed notes, notes that he had apparently failed to destroy&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Midway through the trial, [the judge] counseled Haley and his attorneys that he would have to contemplate a perjury charge unless they settled with Courlander. They did just that to the tune of $650,000, or about $2 million by 2005 standards. In return, Courlander agreed to keep quiet about the suit, which he did until he died in 1996. </p>
<p>The media paid scant attention to the suit and even then failed to explore the real gist of the scandal: namely that the author of a �?nonfiction&rsquo; book plagiarized from a fictional one&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember, as always, to Spread the Word about this easily-provable deceit, (and unjustice) tell everyone you know  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s time to expose these liars and cheats for what they are.</p>

			<p>There is a REAL problem with RAMPANT, DISPROPORTIONATE, black male sexual predation of women of other races:<br>
Yet ANOTHER black US serviceman, Tyrone Luther Hadnott, 38, was just arrested in Okinawa for the rape of a 14 year old Japanese schoolgirl the past week. (Remember the 3 black U.S. servicemen who kidnapped and gang raped that 12 year old Japanese school girl in Okinawa a while back?) Statistically, what is the probability that all these rapes of Japanese school girls in Okinawa would just happen to be committed by BLACK U.S. servicemen, even though the VAST MAJORITY of U.S. servicemen are NOT black?</p>
<p>He is described as a &#8220;light skinned black&#8221;. He is clearly black from the photo but interestingly, to Japanese, light skin blacks resemble Caucasians, although they do distinguish them as black.<br>
https://mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/face/news/20080215p2g00m0dm011000c.html</p>
<p>Even though white on black rapes are nearly non-existent, while black on white rape is epidemic, any time a white is accused of raping a black, it IMMEDIATELY is made a racial issue, and whipped into a national racial hysteria, a la the Tawana Brawley hoax and the Durham hoax. Given that, there should be no criticism of making a RACIAL issue out of black on non-black rapes, ESPECIALLY given that there are about a 100 cases of black on non-black rape for each one case of the reverse. Blacks like to make baseless racial criticisms of non-blacks all the time, and are given a megaphone by the Liberal media to do so un-challenged, so no one has any business condemning those who make a racial complaint, well founded, about RAMPANT black on non-black rapes.<br>

<p>Even more serious than that &#8220;Roots&#8221; was plagiarized and pure fiction (although passed as &#8220;fact&#8221;), it wasn&rsquo;t even HISTORICALLY accurate: It depicted white slavers going inland and kidnapping hapless blacks, when the FACTS are that whites at that time did not dare venture ashore and it was BLACK AFRICANS who kidnapped, forced marched to the coast, and sold the blacks they had enslaved. So in reality &#8220;Roots&#8221; was inflammatory racial HATE propaganda. No telling how many whites have been victims of rape, violence, or murder at the hands of blacks thanks to &#8220;Roots&#8221;.<br>
And yet pandering whites, always in denial, were so clueless that they would put a smiley face on this with dopey articles about how &#8220;Roots&#8221; sparked interest in Genealogy!</p>

<p><br>
Thanks for your belated welcome and comments Taurus689. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure who&rsquo;s accused who of whinning, perhaps you could specify or elaborate, etc.</p>
<p>And as far as doing something about it is concerned, I think that there are stages.</p>
<p>Any transformation of consciousness does not come over night.</p>
<p>The only way out is through.  And you&rsquo;ve got to go though simply because nothing changes until it becomes what it is. <br>
 <br>
But to get there one does experience a sort of breakdown.  Which is why most people avoid it and never change.  Still, it can be done and the risks are worth it.  Plus, a life devoted to total comfort always backfires.</p>
<p>I never believed the &#8220;People never change&#8221; myth.  They can and do.  But it is true that a lot don&rsquo;t because life is short and they want to avoid pain. </p>
<p>Fact is, &#8220;pain is the touchstone of spiritual growth&#8221;</p>
<p>Long story short&hellip;</p>
<p>First things first. We may live in the Information Age, but not enough of us have absorbed the necessary information for the Realism Movements, such as Race Realism, and Immigration Realism, not to mention the important advances regarding our knowledge of the Family. We need to do our homework, so to speak, BEFORE we engage more fully with those who oppose us.  Kind of look before you leap, so to speak.  So long as we don¡t stay stuck in theory. </p>
<p>But I would also say, that the these movements themselves are crying out to be put into an even larger context. To be frank, they are, right now, too Conservative, too defensive.  It is the Achilles Heel of the Realism movements, in my view.</p>
<p>I have to say that it&rsquo;s impossible not to notice that those who complain that we&rsquo;re not doing enough never bring this up.  </p>

This may have been disseminated by the controlled media.  Whites are uniformly cast as villainous fiends (Simon Legrees) in Roots. This series increased anti-white feelings enormously.</p>

			<p><i>The woman also told jurors Henderson repeatedly said he was attacking her because her forefathers raped and enslaved his ancestors. The woman is white, and Henderson is black.</i></p>
<p>American blacks have about 15-20% white admixture. Who are the whites in their family tree? They&rsquo;re the &#8220;rapists&#8221; who make up Henderson&rsquo;s ancestors. In other words, Mr. Henderson is more likely to be a descendant of white rapists than his victim is.</p>

<p>That admixture did not occur due to rape. It is a myth that white slave owners routinely raped their slaves. Such incidents were rare. Slave owners did not go around raping slave women because that would have completely disrupted the economic operation of the plantation and the products of such acts would have scandalized the family and the community. Read, for instance,  &#8220;Time On the Cross&#8221; by (1993 Nobel Laureate) Robert William Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman.<br>
If you look in the deep South the blacks show almost no admixture. That occurred after slavery as blacks moved into white areas. Mostly due to consensual quiet affairs (e.g. along lines of Strom Thurman). And also widespread prostitution.</p>

<p>Having said that, I urge all women living alone to buy a pistol, learn how to handle and shoot it safely. Then keep it handy at all times. If your state allows it, try to get a carry permit.</p>
<p>You simply cannot expect 911 calls to provide instant response. The 911 centers are generally staffed by city employees (read minority employees). Police officers cannot always respond fast enough in an emergency   &mdash;   whether due to traffic or other problems.</p>
<p>When you hear the sound of breaking glass or a door being forced, grab your gun. It is your first line of defense for yourself, your family. DO NOT BE MISLEAD by the propaganda spewed by anti-gun groups. There are far more incidents of a gun SAVING lives or preventing crimes, than guns being turned against their owners. But don&rsquo;t expect the media to tell you the truism of that statement, much less air stories relating how would-be victims successfully defended themselves, their loved ones, with a handgun.</p>

			<p>At least this is going to get a lengthy jail sentence. If this happened in Ireland he would probably get 2 or 3 years in a minimum security prison which are run like hotels, and on appeal that would be lowered.</p>
<p>Prison does not seem to deter rapists anyway. Maybe more severe punishments like chemical castration would have an effect. </p>

<p>Hi &#8220;truth,&#8221; &#8220;UCBM,&#8221; or whatever you&rsquo;re calling yourself lately (sorta like the progression of names given to blacks over time - gotta change aliases now and then to escape one&rsquo;s rep?).</p>
<p>Um, I think the guy mentioned it pretty prominently, what more do you want?  A graph?  Maybe a coloring or popup book?</p>

			<p>OK so this is a hate crime.  IF the roles were reversed it would be charged as one.  </p>
