						<p>The huge influx of Polish workers, which has transformed the labour market across the country, has peaked, official statistics have disclosed.</p>
<p>More than 750,000 east and central European immigrants have flocked to all parts of Britain since eight former eastern bloc countries joined the EU in 2004. But the tide seems to be turning as the economies of the new EU member states strengthen.</p>
<p>The numbers of east European immigrants approved to work in Britain dropped from 227,875 in 2006 to 206,905 last year, a fall of nearly 10 per cent, and the trend is expected to accelerate over the next decade. Poles, who make up two-thirds of the newcomers, are understood to be returning home in greater numbers, drawn by higher salaries, job shortages and the fall in the value of the pound.</p>
<p>Danny Sriskandarajah, head of migration at the Institute for Public Policy Research, said some were choosing to work in other EU countries which were loosening employment rules. &#8220;Migration from Poland is very unlikely to continue at the levels we have seen in the first few years we have seen after enlargement,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It has always been a question of when these flows started drying up, rather than whether they would.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ministers, who were originally advised that 13,000 east Europeans would come to the UK per year, were caught by surprise at the vast numbers that travelled for Britain after the EU expanded in May 2004. A total of 125,880 moved to the UK in the rest of 2004, followed by 204,970 in 2005. The number climbed to record levels in 2006 before last year&rsquo;s fall. It is unknown how many remained in Britain as the numbers leaving are not recorded. The vast majority of the 765,630 incomers were 505,300 Poles, followed by 77,000 each from Lithuania and Slovakia. Much smaller numbers have come from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Estonia and Slovenia.</p>
<p>Employers have taken on 296,180 east Europeans in office and administration jobs; 144,450 in hospitality and catering; and 77,245 in farm work. David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: &#8220;The comparative success of the UK economy in recent years has been largely due to the influx of willing workers from eastern Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Separate Home Office figures also showed 23,430 asylum-seekers claimed refuge in Britain last year, the lowest total since the early 1990s. But the numbers of failed asylum-seekers removed from Britain last year fell by 26 per cent to 13,595. Overall, the Border and Immigration Agency removed 63,140 people from the UK in the year.</p>
<p><b>Maciek Imiolczyk, 23: &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t like I expected&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>When Maciek Imiolczyk came to London at the beginning of last year he was expecting to stay for several years. &#8220;I thought I could make much more money there, and that it would be an easy life, but it wasn&rsquo;t like I expected,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old from Krakow had a business degree, and hoped to find a well-paid job, but after struggling to find work, he eventually took a post as a receptionist in a hostel. &#8220;I couldn&rsquo;t find anything that paid more than the minimum wage, and it was really hard to live off that. I realised life in London was much tougher than I&rsquo;d been led to believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>After six months of work he became disillusioned and returned to Krakow. Now he works as a tour guide. &#8220;The work I do now is better paid, interesting, and my quality of life is infinitely better.&#8221;</p>

															<h2><a href="https://www.ireland.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0227/1203619480715.html">Chinese Leaving Over Lack of Work Permits, Says Centre</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>Irish Times (Dublin), February 27, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Chinese immigrants are leaving Ireland in large numbers because they cannot get work permits, a seminar on migration has been told.</p>
<p>Five Chinese restaurants have closed in the past month because they could not get permits for their chefs, according to Dr Katharine Chan Mullen, co-founder of the Irish Chinese Information Centre.</p>
<p>She said the Government&rsquo;s Green Card system for immigrants was &lsquo;no good&rsquo; for the Chinese community, many of whom came here on student visas and are working on low incomes. &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t want to stay in this country anyway,&rsquo; she told Minister of State for Integration Conor Lenihan at a seminar organised by the European Commission in Dublin.</p>
<p>Mr Lenihan said he understood what Dr Chan Mullen was saying, however he said there had been abuses of the student visa system. In many cases, students had worked way above the 20 hours allowed under their visas and had attended &lsquo;brass plate&rsquo; language schools that provided &lsquo;threadbare&rsquo; levels of tuition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We should be trying to fill our skills needs from within the EU. That is part of our commitment to the EU.&rsquo; Up to 90 per cent of skills needs were now being met from within the Union, he said. The Minister had earlier spoken of a &lsquo;massive productivity challenge&rsquo; to the country, to move immigrants up to work positions commensurate with their abilities and level of education.</p>
<p>Dr Chan Mullen said many Chinese had been in Ireland for years and still could not read English. She had tried to organise English classes but received no support for premises or other running costs . Siobh&aacute;n O&rsquo;Donoghue, director of the Migrant Rights Centre, said immigrants found it difficult to move on from low-paid, low-status jobs as a result of the policies in place in society.</p>
<p>Earlier, Mr Lenihan warned that a failure to manage integration successfully would result in instability and &lsquo;a recipe for disaster&rsquo;. The Minister said he rejected the extremes of &lsquo;excessive multiculturalism&rsquo; on the one hand and &lsquo;dire assimilation&rsquo; on the other in favour of an approach that stressed social stability and the avoidance of ghettos.<br>

			<p>Bangladeshis, Indians etc. have been trying this on in the UK. They complain that they have to shut down restaurants as they can&rsquo;t get work permits for chefs. Is there some secret or magic that prevents British chefs from being employed and trained in the mystical culinary arts by Bangladeshi or Indian restaurant owners? I guess not. It&rsquo;s a &#8216;cultural&rsquo; thing.</p>

Actually I don&rsquo;t think this is good news. Not really.<br>
For one thing only a percentage of the immigrants there are going back, and the number of Brits leaving remains high.<br>
And worse still, the Arabs and Blacks are staying put and out breeding the native British.</p>
<p>And if the economies of Eastern Europe improve, then eastern European nations can expect the first wave of Arab, Asian and African immigrants to start arriving soon&hellip;</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s  the same all over Europe: eastern and central  European immigrants are more likely to return to their countries than other immigrants. The reason is pretty obvious: they all have half-decent developing countries to go back to when they choose. Unlike Third Worlders who have nowhere else to go. </p>
<p>Who would want to go back to Bangladesh or Nigeria after a stay-however short - in a First World and first class country like the UK? They&rsquo;re not that stupid.</p>
<p>So the Brits and other Western Euros are going to get stuck with the more exotic and less productive immigrants, while they see their fellow Euros (such as the Poles mentioned here) -and even their own countrymen- leave in droves. They could use the numbers, because in places like London or Birmingham natives feel increasingly lonely and unsafe, surrounded by a hostile mob of aliens.</p>

			<p>Of all the immigrant groups how ironic and unfortunate(for England)that it is the polite, hardworking, educated Poles, who, having earned enough are returning to their homelands. Could it be that Poland is still homogeneous and unspoilt enough to make it a desirable place to live? Do Poles have a sense of nationhood and patriotism that seems to be lacking in 3rd worlders? Have they seen the wreckage of England, Ireland and other &#8216;3rd world enriched&rsquo; countries and figured out this ain&rsquo;t what they expected, perhaps they&rsquo;re wise enough to realise while they&rsquo;re away this could be happening to their country.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, they&rsquo;d better get back and save their nation before imported labour arrives to do the jobs native Poles won&rsquo;t do. <br>

<p>Slaves are partly Asiatic and many are atheists thanks to the legacy of communism. They are more likely to commit crimes and are less restricted by moral considerations than are other Europeans. Slavs can be very violent, they are more collective in nature and less individualistic, another Asiatic feature, they often attack in groups like it is typical for Asiatic mongrels like Turks, Roma, and the like.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me!  I&rsquo;m 50% slavic.  My grand parents were 100% Czech.  Definitely white and they were the kind of white Americans you&rsquo;d want.  I traveled to the Czech Republic last year and those people are slavs and let me tell you - they&rsquo;re white!  Not Asiatic.  I felt safe everywhere though Czechs tend to have a constant pissed off experession and always stare.  For the most part they do NOT like non-Europeans, and they can&rsquo;t stand gypsies. I saw lots of Russians too and they&rsquo;re not Asiatic - they&rsquo;re white! I saw groups of rough looking Russian men standing around with buzzed blond hair and they were wearing camoflage pants.  </p>

<p>There is little or none of the Asiatic admixture in Poles, a legacy of Tatar raids, that one sees in Russians (see Russian president Yeltsin). </p>
<p>If anything, Poles have, over centuries, mixed to some degree with Ukrainians, Germans, Scandinavians, and Magyars (Hungarians) to a greater degree. Even with Scotts, who came to Poland in large numbers during the 16th century, and the French, as many of Napoleon&rsquo;s soldiers remained in Poland and married into the local population. </p>
<p>Having said that, those admixtures are a relative drop in the bucket to the original northwest Slavic ethny known as Poles (&#8220;Polanie&#8221; in the 9th Century vernacular). </p>
<p>Despite the large Jewish presence in Poland from the 12th to mid-20th century, there has been very little mixing between the two, due to the religious and cultural separation.</p>

<p>Again, not so much in the case of Poles. Russians and Czechs maybe. Unlike in other Iron Curtain nations, rhe Polish Communist authorities basically turned a blind eye to the Catholic Church, which was, de fact, a very powerful institution during that time, and virtually all Poles were practicing, believing Catholics. The religious intensity mellowed a bit since the fall of Communism, but even todayl, something like 90% of Poles describe themselves as practicing Catholics.</p>

			<p>Proofreader said it right, and it shows just how doomed the UK is.  White immigrants such as Poles and other Eastern Europeans have good places to go back home to, whereas Zimbabweans, Pakistanis, Somalis, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Jamaicans and others know they have nothing promising to return to.  So they stay in the UK (and Australia, USA, Canada, New Zealand) to continue to milk welfare benefits off the state.  Even without such welfare, they get a much better deal by staying in their new countries.  </p>
<p>Note all of this is occurring even as *300,000 to 500,000* Britons permanently leave Britain every year.  England has the highest emigration rate in the world and, in fact, next to Mexico  &mdash;   with twice the population  &mdash;   England even has the highest absolute numbers of emigrants in the world.  My friend in London, who works in the publishing industry, noted that sales of German- and French-language books and audiotapes are at record highs in Britain, with Germany and France being such popular destinations for emigrating British.  In fact, as Germany in particular becomes an even more European oasis (with the mass exodus of Turks due to new German laws and Turkish economic improvement), this process is accelerating further.</p>
<p>So what is the UK left with, when both native-born Britons and Eastern European immigrants leave by the hundreds of thousands every year?  Just what Proofreader is saying: What&rsquo;s left in the UK are those millions of South Asians, Africans and Caribbeans who have no better place to return to.  So England is fast on its way to Third World status  &mdash;   culturally, economically and of course, demographically.  </p>
<p>And the sad news is, Australia  &mdash;   with its new Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd  &mdash;   New Zealand, Canada and even the USA are following in the same footsteps as the UK is.  They too are getting a mass influx from the Third World.  They too are seeing mass emigration of their frustrated White populations.  They too are declining economically.  And unless the corrupt elites in these countries are ousted from power very soon, they too, like the UK, will soon be Third World countries themselves.</p>

<p> The Mexicans are bringing all the cultural aspects of thier country to this one. Our politically correct leaders are willingly sacrificing all the white culture, holidays and customs and replacing them with the Mexican culture. Complain any at all and you are instantly labeled a xenophobic racist, lose your job, get blacklisted and financally destroyed.<br>
 I believe it is a form of insanity to risk life and limb to get away from a place and then try to change the place you go to the place you left behind.Most honest Hispanics( even second and third generation) will admit that thier first loyalty is to Mexico.</p>

Polish universities haven&rsquo;t found any haplogroups but European ones represented in DNA samples of the Polish population. </p>

			<p>Sir,</p>
<p>with regards to Slovenia - according to the official statistic published by the British, the number of Slovenian immigrants is statistically negligible - I waguely remember that 17 (seventeen) Slovenians emmigrated to UK. OTOH, many more Britons settled in Slovenia, especiall the eastern part&hellip;</p>

<p>This &#8220;collective&#8221; identity of the Slavs is actually a good thing and may be what saves them from multiculturalism while Western Europe perishes.  If you ask me, whites these days are a little too individualistic; it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt us to start thinking as a group and looking out for one another.  I don&rsquo;t know a lot about the genetic makeup of Slavs but they look white to me.  In fact, blonde hair and blue eyes seem to be much more common among Slavs than among Western Europeans.  If they can get their birthrates up (which their government is actually working on, as opposed to our governments who want to see us disappear), the Slavs will rule Europe in about 50-100 years.  And, that might not be such a bad thing.</p>

<p>No you&rsquo;re not Dennis. I go over to Ireland every year, and each time I see more and more &#8216;enrichment&rsquo;; Nigerians, Burkas, and forth, and so many Chinese. Admittedly they are hardworking and don&rsquo;t litter the streets as the Rumanian gypsies do, squatting in doorways begging with really smelly babies in their arms. But there are far too many of Chinese and as you I&rsquo;m asking why? why are there thousands of Chinese in Ireland. They&rsquo;re not refugees or stateless, they&rsquo;re not EU transferees, how did they get to live in Ireland?. Does anyone know?<br>
There are plenty of Poles in Ireland too, hardworking, polite, English speaking, blue-eyed blondes who will be Irish in a generation. Unfortunately if anyone goes home it will be them.<br>

			<p>&#8220;I felt safe everywhere though Czechs tend to have a constant pissed off experession and always stare.&#8221;</p>
<p>You raise an interesting point. I get a lot of German language DVD movies from the library (Unlike the French, Germans seem to make decent flicks. Sorry. And they sometimes put an English soundtrack in.) and if you ask, me there seems to be an awful lot of angry, ANGRY people in Deutchland.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Slavs are partially Asiatic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not judging from the enormous percentage of blue-eyed blonds among them, they&rsquo;re not!</p>
