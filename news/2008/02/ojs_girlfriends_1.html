<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>It has now been reported that has now learned that a neurologist at the hospital where O.J. Simpson&rsquo;s girlfriend Christie Prody is being treated has told police her injuries are consistent with an assault, not a fall. O.J. Simpson&rsquo;s long-time girlfriend has severe injuries that are consistent with an assault, rather than simply a fall.</p>
<p>Christie Prody, 32, remains hospitalized at Baptist Hospital in Miami and may be facing brain surgery. The National Enquirer broke the story yesterday of Prody&rsquo;s injuries and revealed that O.J. was questioned by police detectives at his home in Florida. The police are still investigating.</p>
<p>O.J. says that Prody&rsquo;s injuries are self-inflicted and that she went on a drunken binge and fell down. But cops aren&rsquo;t convinced, insiders say. And Prody&rsquo;s injuries are so severe that they are consistent with an assault. Prody was hospitalized after she collapsed at a gas station and hit her head. Simpson was not with her at the time.</p>
<p>But once Prody was examined it became clear that she had more injuries than could have been caused by the fall. She had numerous large bruises and abrasions on her face, arms, legs and buttocks. Police are still investigating, despite an erroneous report on the Web site TMZ.com yesterday saying that Prody&rsquo;s injuries were caused by the fall. Sources very close to the situation tell the Enquirer that information is incorrect.</p>
<p>O.J.&rsquo;s lawyer Yale Galanter denied his client had anything to do with Prody&rsquo;s injuries, an accusation that has not been made by anyone.</p>

			<p>I doubt most people in the world, can bring themselves to feel much sympathy for her. What women in her right mind, that&rsquo;s the key, would go with an accused double murderer, withous thinking that she is one day going to pay for it? I hate to speculate, but there is something in this womens face that seems to suggest she is unconcerned about herself. Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

			<p>If harm ever comes to her, not many of us will cry.  Not after reading about she left her pet kitty to die in her apartment: </p>
<p>&#8220;Prody had apparently been out of town for about a month. Police said that the cat probably starved to death. Police said that Simpson is not involved and that it is strictly an animal-abuse case. Prody was cited for one count of animal cruelty and could face a $500 fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just Google this woman a bit, to find out what a sterling character she is. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t those women see whom are they choosing as a mate? They act as if they were taking it for granted that if the boyfriend they chose tuned a bad boy, it&rsquo;s the society that has to pick up the tab for their own recklessness or lack of brains.<br>

			<p>I would like to sympathize with the woman, but then I think about how foolish she is to ever get involved with this man and realize that she is suffering for her idiocy. The same goes for any white woman who courts black men, understanding how irresponsible, neglectful, and downright abusive they are and how much they envy and hate white people in general. But O.J. Simpson??? Especially after what we know??? How could any white woman be so stupid??? It&rsquo;s beyond stupid.</p>

			<p>No matter what type of civilized environment O.J. Simpson is placed in, he just can&rsquo;t escape his genes.  Black males have a strong penchant for domestic violence, as elaborated in works such as &#8220;the Color Purple,&#8221; &#8220;Autobiography of Malcolm X&#8221; etc.  Like his peers, he cannot help but act out physically against white women.  Because he has financial means, he&rsquo;s not out robbing and raping, but he would be there otherwise. </p>

Christie Prody, 32, remains hospitalized at Baptist Hospital in Miami and may be facing brain surgery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, but I got the best chuckle of the day out of this one.  </p>
<p>Too, it delights me to see that Simpson once again has put down every black woman in the country.  His selection of a white tells the world once again he regards black women as unattractive.</p>
<p>I wonder what the racist black jurors think of their boy now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m curious why this story had to come from the other side of the world to make the news.</p>
<p>If yet another story about this civil rights pioneer - him, not her - beating on a female a fraction his size has occurred, why was it not in the NY Times, LA Times, Chicago Libune, or USA Today?  </p>
<p>Or is this just another example of poor, misunderstood Orenthal being protected by his fawning admirers in the mainstream media? </p>

			<p>Yet another SICK &#8220;white&#8221; female. I guess knowing that he almost DECAPITATED two people while murdering them means nothing to her, just as being White obviously means NOTHING to her. I have NO empathy for her at all. She and all &#8220;white&#8221; women like her are no longer White in my book. Good riddance.</p>

			<p>If it is found out that this woman was assaulted by O.J., then I will have absolutely no pity for her. The idiocy of a woman (no matter the colour) who would associate at all with a man that, as we all know, killed his former (white) wife boggles the mind. Sometimes in life people really do deserve what they get. </p>

			<p>This woman I believe is from the midwest, and when Simpson was in jail while his trial{?} was going on, she started to write to the killer and then came to L.A. to visit him. And does anybody here remember the black thug who killed those people in that Atlanta courthouse a few years ago. He recently tried to hatch an escape plan with the help of a woman he had been pen pals with. She was from Conn. and I believe from her last name she was white, maybe latino, but I think she was white. Her last name seem to be of Italian descent. Anybody here recall this woman? </p>

			<p>Ice, the racist black jurors didn&rsquo;t care about Nicole and Ron, so I wouldn&rsquo;t expect them to care about any other white. More to the point, they didn&rsquo;t care about the mountain of evidence against O.J. All they obviously cared about was freeing a black on trial for the murder of 2 whites, no matter what the proof was.</p>

			<p><b>On a second thought</b>, she must have been thoroughly brainwashed in school. Also, <b>it&rsquo;s likely that her first sexual experience was in school, too, with a black boy</b> (black males reach the age of sexual activity years before whites do and are much more likely to have early sex with their while classmates than the white boys do), which might have been a defining moment in her sexual preferences.</p>
<p>So, she well may be a victim of the &#8220;liberal&#8221; propaganda in schools (including the misdirected application of legal doctrine &#8220;innocent until proven guilty&#8221; of criminal trial to areas of life that have nothing to do with court proceedings) and desegregation.</p>
<p>In other words, don&rsquo;t blame her (which I myself partially did in my previous comment). Blame the liberal manical social engineering for it. And prepare yourself to see more and more victims of liberal pursuit of socialist, color-blind, multicultural utopia.<br>

			<p>I think you guys are forgetting that once she even started SEEING OJ, (not sleeping with him or whatever else may or may not have been happening) she was going to have a much tougher, if not impossible time, attracting a white guy.  Nobody wants to be Ron Goldman, the other person murdered at Nicole&rsquo;s house.  </p>
<p>I think you should be less mean spirited about what happened to her and more open to reading the National Enquirer.  They were the ones who broke the story about the Bruno Magli shoes that OJ was wearing, and they were the ones who ran the story about the cat.  They have not let up on him and I thank them for that. </p>
<p>And, if Barack Obama is elected, get ready for a real crackdown on magazines that tell it like it REALLY is. I for one am not going to vote for a perosn who will demand, and so will his wife, that we spend the next four years &#8220;respecting&#8221; people.  That will get real old real fast.  We have a long history in this country of being able to say whatever we want about our leaders, within reason, and I like things the way they are.  If I want to read about George and Laura in the National Enquirer, then I can buy the magazine, or not.  I always want to buy the Enquirer when there&rsquo;s a story about OJ, because they have been very consistent in their efforts to expose who he really is.  His ties, and ties to people around him, to gangs, go back probably 40 years.  He is a very dangerous man.</p>

			<p>She met OJ while sitting on her bicycle, outside the gates of his mansion. This was during the trial, which she watched daily. Apparently, she had styled her hair to look like Nicole, and to catch OJ&rsquo;s eye. Her plan worked, and she has been with him ever since.  Although, she claimed to believe he was innocent at first, it&rsquo;s hard to swallow, considering how she tried to look like the object of his obsession.During break-ups she has spoken out to the media, complaining about him, and even admitting she later suspected he was guilty afterall. But she always went back to him. Today it is obvious she is living with the same cycle of abuse Nicole lived with on a regular basis. I truly wish her well, but it is hard to understand how anyone could play such a dangerous game. </p>

			<p>That any woman, regardless of color, is more likely than not to come to harm after spending any appreciable amount of time in an intimate relationship with OJ is a given. I am incredulous at the number of white women who have willingly entered into relationships with black thugs, drug dealers, rapists, murderers, and assorted excons. Every one of them with whom I am personally acquainted have come to considerable grief, and most to physical harm. I admit to being flabbergasted by how many have gone this route. I know that the MSM and the schools have been pushing the black male/white female liason for decades, but I still don&rsquo;t understand why white women don&rsquo;t see the danger and the virtually inevitable outcome.</p>

			<p>Now, let&rsquo;s not jump to conclusions.  There is the possibility that she got these injuries not from Simpson, but from some other black stud she&rsquo;s been hanging around.  Remember, he&rsquo;s been busy busting up memorabilia rings in Las Vegas hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Remember the black woman who said her mulatto kid, tucked away safely in an Australian boarding school, was sired by Bill Clinton?  DNA tests proved him the son of some other white man.  That doesn&rsquo;t exonerate Clinton, of course, or make her a liar  &mdash;   just that she had (at least) two white guys going around the same time, and the other was a faster &#8220;swimmer&#8221;&hellip;</p>

			<p>Does this story prove that there is some truth behind the &ldquo;Dumb Blond&rdquo; jokes?</p>
<p>Sorry, not for me I am blonde and wouldn&rsquo;t give OJ the time of day. And for what it&rsquo;s worth, the Dumb blonde stereotype was manufactured in Hollywood, by a bunch of bleached blonde actresses like Judy Holliday, Jane Mansfield and the like. </p>

			<p>You can&rsquo;t fix stupid but you can fix racially naive, so she got what she deserved.</p>
<p>I was watching the news and they were talking about a Marine base in Japan being locked down due to the rape of a 14 year old Japanese girl.  They then said tensions were high in that country due to the &#8220;gang&#8221; rape of a 12 year old girl 10 years ago in Okinawa.</p>
<p>Curious as I was, I Googled &#8220;Okinawa Gang Rape&#8221; and suprise, suprise, suprise, 3 black Marines were the culprits.   I couldn&rsquo;t find a picture of the current suspect but his first name was Tyrone so I can only guess.</p>
<p>Blacks seem to have a trademark on gang rape. </p>
<p>On another note, a white freshman high school honor student was gunned down in Las Vegas walking home from school.  They have no motive but they do have two suspects.  Guess again, black.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how  the media will never  bring up the racial angle to these stories unless there is a minority victim.</p>
<p>With Obama getting high praise, the black race will only be empowered to continue their staggering path of violence against whites.</p>
<p>Never be afraid to tell the truth and be prepared. This is the only way to wake our people up.</p>

			<p>This may sound harsh but I&rsquo;ll it anyways: She got what she deserves.  In virtually any other situation, I would agree that Whites should never allow a black to raise a finger against a White woman.  But this is the extreme exception   &mdash;   this piece-of-trash, Prody, deserves everything she gets.  </p>
<p>Stupidity of this magnitude is truly incomprehensible yet, somehow, not at all surprising.</p>

			<p>HaplogroupR1a1: when I first heard about the incident in Japan involving the girl of 12 being abducted and raped, I told my mom that if the perps were black, they&rsquo;d yell, &#8220;Racism!&#8221; Sure enough, the creeps claimed their superior officer had forced them to confess. I&rsquo;m sure the superior was a WASP man.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ice, the racist black jurors didn&rsquo;t care about Nicole and Ron, so I wouldn&rsquo;t expect them to care about any other white.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t referring to any concern they might have, Cindy.  When I rhetorically asked what they might think of their boy now, I was referring to the fact it has been years now, and here&rsquo;s another white woman he favored, rejecting blacks.</p>
<p>When the blacks set him loose, one of the jurors said to the effect that he should now show his gratitude to blacks by coming back to the black community.  Having white girl friends and white acquaintances, mostly, has got to be a huge disappointment for them.</p>

			<p>On their 1966 album, &#8220;Aftermath,&#8221; the Rolling Stones had a song called &#8220;Stupid Girl.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s what I was thinking of when I read this piece.  What in the name of God and Mammon was this woman thinking of in seeking O.J. for a lover?  She fully well knows he&rsquo;s a double murderer   &mdash;   that it was only a matter of time before he&rsquo;d work her over.  Are white women so horny, debased and dumb that they have to go out and catch &#8220;Jungle Fever?&#8221;  Is there a &#8220;Stockholm Syndrome&#8221; encoded in their genes?  What gives, people? </p>

			<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re a racist!&#8221; thats the most feared words for a white person. Saddled with guilt of their ancestors&hellip;lol.<br>
But why, I ask. You never slaved any blacks,right?<br>
It seems too many whites are catering to blacks these days.<br>
Look at all these white liberal idiots fawning over Obama. just because the liberal white media likes him. Blacks in America can&rsquo;t even clean up their own communities and yet white Americans want to put him in the White house?<br>
Most whites I know who live in major cities with significant numbers of blacks certainity won&rsquo;t be voting for a black person.<br>
Just as most Asian Americans, we&rsquo;re sick of the crimes and pandering from these people.<br>
Isn&rsquo;t it funny how most recent immigrants from Asia can come to this country and be productive to this society yet blacks keep complaining there are no opportunities?<br>
Hummmmm&hellip;..must tbe the lazy ass genes.<br>
