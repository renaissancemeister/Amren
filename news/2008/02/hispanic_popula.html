						<p>The number of Hispanics in the United States will triple by 2050 and represent nearly 30 percent of the population if present trends continue, according to a report released Monday.</p>
<p>The study by the nonpartisan, Washington-based Pew Research Center also found that nearly one in five Americans will be foreign-born in 2050, compared with about one in eight today. Asian Americans, representing 5 percent of the population today, are expected to boost their share to 9 percent.</p>
<p>Blacks are projected to maintain their current 13 percent share. Non-Hispanic whites will still be the nation&rsquo;s largest group, but they will drop from 67 percent of U.S. residents to 47 percent.</p>
<p>Overall, the U.S. population will increase by 47 percent from 296 million in 2005 to 438 million by 2050, with newly arriving immigrants accounting for 47 percent of the rise, and their U.S.-born children and grandchildren representing another 35 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because of a declining birthrate among U.S.-born women, immigrants and their U.S.-born children and grandchildren already account for most of the nation&rsquo;s population increase over the past several decades. The study projects that by 2025, the foreign-born share of the population will surpass the peak recorded during the wave of immigration that occurred between 1860 and 1920, when foreign-born residents represented as much as 15 percent of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>But the study&rsquo;s authors said that immigration will do little to offset the more than doubling of the nation&rsquo;s elderly population as baby boomers age. By 2050, people older than 65 will make up 19 percent of the population, compared with 12 percent in 2005, while the share of working-age people will shrink from 63 to 58 percent.</p>

															<h2><a href="https://pewresearch.org/pubs/729/united-states-population-projections">Executive Summary Immigration to Play Lead Role in Future U.S. Growth</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>Jeffrey Passel and D'Vera Cohn, Pew Research Center, February 11, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>If current trends continue, the population of the United States will rise to 438 million in 2050, from 296 million in 2005, and 82% of the increase will be due to immigrants arriving from 2005 to 2050 and their U.S.-born descendants, according to new projections developed by the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>Of the 117 million people added to the population during this period due to the effect of new immigration, 67 million will be the immigrants themselves and 50 million will be their U.S.-born children or grandchildren.</p>
<p>Among the other key population projections: </p>
<p>*&nbsp;Nearly one in five Americans (19%) will be an immigrant in 2050, compared with one in eight (12%) in 2005. By 2025, the immigrant, or foreign-born, share of the population will surpass the peak during the last great wave of immigration a century ago.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;The major role of immigration in national growth builds on the pattern of recent decades, during which immigrants and their U.S.-born children and grandchildren accounted for most population increase. Immigration&rsquo;s importance increased as the average number of births to U.S.-born women dropped sharply before leveling off. </p>
<p>*&nbsp;The Latino population, already the nation&rsquo;s largest minority group, will triple in size and will account for most of the nation&rsquo;s population growth from 2005 through 2050. Hispanics will make up 29% of the U.S. population in 2050, compared with 14% in 2005. </p>
<p>*&nbsp;Births in the United States will play a growing role in Hispanic and Asian population growth; as a result, a smaller proportion of both groups will be foreign-born in 2050 than is the case now. </p>
<p>*&nbsp;The non-Hispanic white population will increase more slowly than other racial and ethnic groups; whites will become a minority (47%) by 2050. </p>
<p>*&nbsp;The nation&rsquo;s elderly population will more than double in size from 2005 through 2050, as the baby boom generation enters the traditional retirement years. The number of working-age Americans and children will grow more slowly than the elderly population, and will shrink as a share of the total population.</p>
<p>The Center&rsquo;s projections are based on detailed assumptions about births, deaths and immigration levels &mdash; the three key components of population change. All these assumptions are built on recent trends. But it is important to note that these trends can change. All population projections have inherent uncertainties, especially for years further in the future, because they can be affected by changes in behavior, by new immigration policies, or by other events. Nonetheless, projections offer a starting point for understanding and analyzing the parameters of future demographic change.</p>
<p>The Center&rsquo;s report includes an analysis of the nation&rsquo;s future &ldquo;dependency ratio&rdquo; &mdash; the number of children and elderly compared with the number of working-age Americans. There were 59 children and elderly people per 100 adults of working age in 2005. That will rise to 72 dependents per 100 adults of working age in 2050.</p>
<p>The report also offers two alternative population projections, one based on lower immigration assumptions and one based on higher immigration assumptions.<br>
