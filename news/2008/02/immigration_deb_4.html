WASHINGTON (Reuters) &mdash; John Graham&rsquo;s crab company has held its own for 65 years as the local catch has dwindled and cheap Chinese crabmeat filled the supermarkets. It might not survive the immigration debate in the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>Graham relies on temporary workers who come from Mexico to pick crabmeat from the shells because he can&rsquo;t find enough employees in Hampton, Virginia. But a program that allowed him to bring back experienced workers quietly expired last year after Congress failed to overhaul broken immigration laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thousands of small businesses across the United States rely on foreign, seasonal workers to shuck oysters, mow lawns, clean hotel rooms and pick crops because there are not enough Americans willing to do such work. The high-tech industry says it needs skilled workers from overseas to write software because there are too few Americans qualified to fill those jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As a recession looms, many seasonal businesses are scrambling to find workers or making plans to scale back.</p>
<p>The 66,000 slots available under the existing visa program for temporary seasonal workers are not nearly enough to satisfy the demand and usually are snapped up within a day or two.</p>
<p>In the past, businesses have been able to exceed the cap by bringing back workers they&rsquo;ve hired before using what are known as H-2R visas, but that provision of the program expired last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Hampton, on the Atlantic coast 175 miles south of the U.S. capital, Graham expects revenues to plunge this year without the 100 Mexicans who make up the bulk of his workforce. Locals aren&rsquo;t interested in work that&rsquo;s only available for six months out of the year, he says, and competition with cheap crabmeat from East Asia prevents him from increasing wages enough to attract them.</p>
<p>With his factory shuttered, crab fishermen will have no place to sell their catch, he said &mdash; which could spell the end of a centuries-old industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re talking about coastal heritages and traditions that were founded on the waterfront, that have been in place for generations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s dwindling all the time but this will be the nail in the coffin.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Baloney.  There are plenty of actual Americans who would take these jobs&hellip; IF they would hire us.  These job openings are also never, ever advertised.  Strictly word-of-mouth.  That&rsquo;s why the Mexitrash always know where the job openings are and you don&rsquo;t.  It is also a fallacy that this imported labor is cheap.  Even the Lefty MSM managed to let slip within the past year that non-Whites and homosexuals working at the same jobs and on the same level as straight, native-born Whites are routinely paid more.  I know for a fact that on the last job I was able to get, the non-White employees (both native-born and immigrant) were hired at a dollar an hour higher than the White ones, because I asked them and they were dumb enough to tell me.   Even if there were no willing participants on the part of actual Americans, we have millions and millions of very expensive welfare recipients and prisoners who aren&rsquo;t earning their keep, either.</p>

<p><br>
What the article SHOULD say is &#8220;because there are not enough BLACKS willing to do such work&#8221;.</p>
<p>Because that is really what this is all about.  Since the civil rights movement came to prominence, more and more blacks are losing interest in working at those jobs suitable to their temperament and IQ, and gaining an interest in drugs, violent crime and going on welfare.</p>
<p>Corporate america is tired of the whole issue and has lobbied quite effectively to BOTH the republicans and the democrats to bring mexicans into the US in large numbers as a replacement for blacks.</p>
<p>Remember what happened after Katrina?  Large numbers of illegal aliens showed up to do the work of cleaning up.  Problem is, that work was already being done by &#8220;Americans&#8221;.  They fired all the blacks en masse and told them, &#8220;we don&rsquo;t need you anymore, the mexicans are here&#8221;.</p>
<p>Understand that if you understand nothing else about the illegal alien issue.  It&rsquo;s about displacing blacks from their economic niche in this country because they are increasingly a social problem.</p>
<p>Which of course, begs the question, &#8220;what do the powers that be plan to do with the blacks in this country&#8221;.  Because of the fascist bent of the left, and the callous nature of how they&rsquo;ve exploited blacks for generations now, I rather suspect they mean something sinister.</p>

			<p>Perhaps John Graham would be better off moving his crab business down to mexico where he can find all the mexican workers he needs. I believe he would be happier and I know I, and many more whites like me, would be also. </p>

			<p>If any industry/business can not makeit without foreign labor then nail that business coffin. I think this is all hogwash!  If businessmen need this foreign labor they need to go to the labor.   This is all about international unions using business to create transient workers/serfs! And how come the ag businesses can not pay living wages but the CEO make millions.   V</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s available so it&rsquo;s used.  I was astounded a couple of years ago when I traveled up to Mackinac Island for a couple of days vacation and found large numbers of foreign workers doing the work Americans allegedly won&rsquo;t do.  Until not very long ago a summer job on Mackinac, Michigan&rsquo;s leading summer vacation spot, was a plum job for Michigan high school kids.  Indeed, there are sinister forces at work.</p>

Do any of these people who employ seasonal and migrant labor actually make the effort to find other workers?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my belief that they could find local workers if they simply went looking and altered their work schedules.</p>
<p>For example, they could hire people on part time shifts. It may not be that people won&rsquo;t do this work but that doing it for extended periods of time make it difficult for many people.</p>
<p>What are the wages he&rsquo;s offering? I know everyone wants to keep their cost down but he may find that increasing wages (and unfortunately the cost of a crab meat meal) would enlarge his worker pool.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about finding labor. It&rsquo;s about finding cheap labor. There&rsquo;s a difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for these employers to &#8216;think outside the box&rsquo; and make solutions. </p>

			<p>No one has addressed the fact that we admit two million &#8220;legal&#8221; immigrants each year.Don&rsquo;t these people need jobs? We also have plenty of refugees from political or religious persecution, eight visa programs for foreign workers and the list goes on. Don&rsquo;t these people also need work? Why do we need to continue to fill this country with illegals? </p>

			<p>Let ONE Washington bureaucrat&rsquo;s wife, daughter or relative ever be raped or killed by an immigrant   &mdash;   and watch the border fence be finished at CRASH PRIORITY! But in that lies the rub. The bureaucrats, fine words notwithstanding, simply never have this happen to THEIR loved ones. No, friends, that&rsquo;s for us common rabble to deal with.</p>
<p>Let the unthinkable happen to them, the H1B visa giveaway would drop like an elevator. The border fence and ARMED TROOPS PATROLLING BOTH BORDERS, a reality! Racial profiling laws? They&rsquo;ll be repealed and declared &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; before tomorrow night.</p>
<p>But the caring bureaucrats, ever solicitous of American people, hope and pray instead that some Hollywood airhead does something wacko or outrageous. TO KEEP OUR MINDS OFF THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM! To keep us focused on that kind of trivial garbage ground daily out by the print and electronic media   &mdash;   so we&rsquo;re too numbed with this slop to remember to write or phone our &#8220;representatives&#8221; in the House and Senate with our justified outrage over immigration   &mdash;   LEGAL OR ILLEGAL!</p>
<p>Nor will the fine sons and daughters of these political hacks ever be faced with loss of THEIR jobs to a cheap-working immigrant from Asia. No, THEIR kids can count on a cushy, overpaid editorial job with a fancy magazine, or a &#8216;junior executive&rsquo; position offered by a grateful CEO who &#8220;owes&#8221; Senator Graft or Congressman Bribery big-time for the oh-so-helpful helpful legislation recently enacted for his corporation.</p>
<p>Think about it friends&hellip; Now you can understand why the political hacks will talk the immigration issue talk&hellip; while secretly doing the complete opposite behind our backs. Be sure, be very sure to show your appreciation on Election Day, this coming November. Let the bureaucrats &#8220;hear&#8221; from us   &mdash;   who have to put up with the other side of the immigration picture!</p>

			<p>Funny that the article accuses American natives of being &#8220;too proud&#8221; to work in the crab industry, but stupid enough to be unqualified for high tech jobs.  It&rsquo;s lies like these that many people believe immivaders, outsourcing, and cheap foreign goods &#8220;saved&#8221; the economy.</p>

			<p>    The reason &#8220;there are not enough Americans willing to do such work&#8221; is BECAUSE immigrants have already destroyed wage levels across so many industries. Without the presence of immigrants, who live ten in an apartment and pool their money to pay rent (something a married father of two can&rsquo;t compete with), employers would be forced to pay livable wages and Americans would be ABLE to do the jobs. </p>
<p>    On another note, of course it would be unthinkable to keep out competing cheap East Asian crabmeat to protect American crab sellers. This is absolute heresy to the &#8220;free trade at all costs&#8221; neocons and &#8220;racism&#8221; against East Asians to the leftwing anti-white weirdos. </p>
