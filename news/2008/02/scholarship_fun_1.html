<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Nearly 80 percent of Japanese-American 10th-graders passed the state&rsquo;s standardized math test last year in Seattle Public Schools. As a group, they did better than any other ethnic group in the district.</p>
<p>Only 14 percent of Samoan students passed the math portion of the Washington Assessment of Student Learning &mdash; the lowest percentage of any ethnic group in the district.</p>
<p>There are vast social and cultural differences between the two groups that play into their success in school. Yet on a scholarship application, students from both would check the same box: Asian/Pacific Islander. So would students who trace their heritage to at least seven other Asian countries or islands.</p>
<p>The diversity of Asian/Pacific Islander students makes providing them scholarships complicated. Until five years ago, there wasn&rsquo;t a national scholarship fund for Asian/Pacific Islander students, even though funds for African-American and Latino students had existed for decades. A national group meeting Monday in Seattle is working to provide more scholarships to Asian and Pacific Islander students who need them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The scholarship fund, or APIASF, is holding a community reception today at the Seattle Asian Art Museum from 5 to 7:30 p.m. On Tuesday, the group will hold its annual board meeting in Seattle.</p>
<p>The scholarship organization formed in 2003 when the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation began its Gates Millennium Scholars program. The foundation had money for Asian students, but no group existed to accept the funds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, APIASF, a Washington, D.C.-based organization, gives out about 200 scholarships a year and selects Gates Millennium Scholars. As a fairly new group, it has no endowment and spends a lot of time raising money. A comparable group for African-American students, the United Negro College Fund, has existed for 60 years and is working toward a $1 billion endowment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Seattle, the director of an after-school program for Pacific Islander students, von Paul Patu, said he feels Pacific Islander students are sometimes lost in the shuffle. Potential funders may feel that since Asian/Pacific Islander students are doing well as a group, they don&rsquo;t need extra help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His organization provides counseling, after-school tutoring and support for South Pacific Islander students, but he said the group has struggled to find funding.</p>
<p>One way to make sure groups get their unique needs met is for the district and scholarship groups to work with ethnic-community groups, said School Board President Cheryl Chow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the Samoan/Pacific Islander students do have a different set of challenges that are different from Asian kids, because each culture is so different,&#8221; she said.</p>

			<p>Wow - two groups of people at complete opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of intelligence, temperment, physical size, crime rates - are  &#8220;classified&#8221;  together? </p>
<p>I guess that ranks right up there with grouping hispanics with whites when committing hate crimes.</p>
<p>Oh ya, don&rsquo;t forget about grouping Persians with Whites in census tallies&hellip;</p>
<p>Good grief, this world has gone mad.</p>

<p>Hold on - I would like to announce the formation of a new  foundation to somehow help Asian students.</p>
<p>Sounds like a pretty good scam, though.  Yea, we&rsquo;ve got all this money to give away, but darn, no one to accept it.</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;ve seen it in New Zealand as well:</p>
<p>While most &#8220;East Asian&#8221; groups (Japanese, Chinese etc) fare reasonably well, mostly better, than white students, the Pacific Islanders fall into most of the same &#8220;traps&#8221; that befall &#8220;African-Americans&#8221;, such as low-scores, youth gangs etc.</p>
<p>But &#8220;white New Zealand&#8221; be damned! New Zealand is part of the Pacific! WE NEED MORE PACIFIC ISLANDERS!</p>
<p>Rant aside, grouping both East Asians and Pacific Islanders together as &#8220;Asian&#8221; is as fallacious as grouping north Africans/sub-Saharan Africans as &#8220;Africans&#8221;.</p>

<p>Nothing in this country would be complicated if the radical leftists didn&rsquo;t have control of the universities and the organs of communication.</p>
<p>It is only mentally and emotionally disturbed white radicals that would even think of opting for a society where the masses were comprised of a squabbling array of tribes, each one pursuing its own agenda and all of them fighting each other for control and domination.</p>
<p>After thousands of years of human failure a small band of white intllectuals came up with a system of government that could have carried on for centuries if not for the hijacking of the country by elements that deemed fractionalizing this nation would guarantee their safety, too dense to know or care that they were contributing to its demise.</p>
<p>If the country is successful in regrouping in any meaningful way after an implosion, it is this seditious group that must be publicly tried in order to air their crimes for all humanity to see, just as was done at Nurenburg.</p>

			<p>Wish I&rsquo;d had the &#8216;social and cultural&rsquo; advantages of the Japanese - I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be really good at maths. I wonder if I give my Kids a more Japanese upbringing whether they will inherit - from the culture, I mean, naturally - a mathematical aptitude.  </p>

<p>No! The true cause of the poor academic performance of the Pacific Islanders is genes.  We would never expect evolution to make different, genetically isolated populations to be identical.  In fact, if such an event occurred, it would be one of the most amazing phenomena in science. Human races are the end result of differential evolution.  Some races are taller and heavier, some have darker skin, and some are dumber.  Unfortunately, Pacific Islanders got body size, and Japanese got intelligence. It&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>

<p>Here, do this. Get your kids interested in Amatuer Radio (arrl.org). And get them interested in chemistry (FIREWORKS! BOOM!). Nothing get&rsquo;s a kid&rsquo;s mind going than using their brain to actually do SOMETHING mathematical that they can actually apply to a real world problem. No telling what they can become interested in. Get them a small metal cutting lathe. With the right &#8220;cool tools&#8221; at their disposal, the sky&rsquo;s the limit, IF THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO MATH.</p>

			<p>Looks like leaving the USA might not have been such a good idea if my children could have used their mother to get themselves some Pacific Islander affirmative action. If my whiteness would have lost their eligibility, we could have just lied and said that the father was unknown and maybe even gotten more goodies from a corrupt racial spoils system.<br/>

			<p>Culture and funding are holding them back, not intelligence. That sounds familiar.</p>
<p>So if we tell them to abandon their culture and throw  money at them, they will become smart enough to know that education is important.</p>
<p>Seems to me, exceptional students would get scholarships regardless of their culture.</p>

			<p>Why can&rsquo;t they just make a scholarship for Pacific Islanders only?  It seems obvious that if they made a scholarship where Chinese, Koreans and Japanese get to compete for the same awards as Samoans the Samoans would wind up with nothing. </p>

			<p>Depends how you want to chop up the races. If you go three races, then Polynesians are Asians but North Africans are Caucasians and the rest are Africans. There is more genetic distance between Northeast and Southeast Asians than between Northeast Asians and Caucasians. If you go 8 races, I think you can some race called Pacific Islanders, with Islanders absurdly tossed in with Papuans, which makes no sense. Polynesians are a cross between Taiwanese aborigines and Melanesians, about 50-50 spit, mothers from one group, fathers from another. So 50% of the stock is really Chinese types from Taiwan. They are more intelligent than US Blacks and vastly less violent. Their crime rate is 2X US Whites, but Black crime rate is 8.1X. They don&rsquo;t seem to do so well in modern societies for some reason, but in Samoa, they have basically retained a traditional society and the crime rate is near zero. American Samoa, right across the way, has a crime rate that is quite high. The crime rate on the Cook Islands is very low and there are fears that if tourists flood in, the crime rate will shoot right up.</p>
<p>These groups bring a certain genetic plate to the table. Recognition of this will allow us to fashion environments for each group that reduce their pathologies to the maximum and bring out their strengths to the highest. One size fits all solutions probably do not work. Societal or sociological interventions will be best designed based on which environment works best for each race.</p>
<p>Samoans are not really behaviorally like Blacks. I taught both groups for years in the schools. Samoans are pretty hard to describe, it would take another post to do so. Let&rsquo;s just say that you can see the Asian in them all right, especially with the females. Some of the females are quite bright.</p>

			<p>The government-endowed special privilege groups are arbitrary. &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;, &#8220;Asian&#8221; &#8220;African American&#8221; are artificial designations. A person from Spain is very different from a Puerto Rican. A Samoan is very different from a Japanese. <br/>
These groups were created by the government in order to divide people into groups that would fight over getting the most special privileges. But mainly, these groups were created to exclude Whitey from getting any privileges at all.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand. The Pacific Islanders are suppose to have larger brains than the Japanese. I saw a comparison not to long ago, and maybe I got the two mixed up, but I thought that the Polynesians were Pacific Islanders too. Y&rsquo;see Madagascar used to be populated by non-black Polynesians who began populating the islands several hundreds of years ago. They even preached that they were a master race. Interesting, but I think that the Japanese are an inferior race, that has a big ego. Y&rsquo;know that the people of India, especially the darker skinned Dravidians score higher than anybody else in the world, and the Chinese (who score higher on IQ tests), score somewhat lower in the same tests? The only group that scores lower than any of these groups and has the worst crime rate in the world are the people of Subsaharan Africa.</p>

			<p>And Pacific Islanders is in itself very variable group in culture and appearance as well. There are rather friendly cultures, open cultures who made long sea journeys, closed island cultures, there still are belligerent cannibal cultures. There are light-tanned Islanders as well as almost black Islanders with a completely different face features. </p>
<p>And grouping Asians (in itself also very different people in origin, culture and history) with Pacific Islanders is a joke in the  genetical as well as cultural points of view.</p>

			<p>Emily says that each CULTURE is different.  I say that each RACE is different.  Tongans are lumped into the &#8220;Asian&#8221; category with Japanese, when it is clear they have a much lower IQ.  Sort of like the difference between Cuban &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; and Mexican &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;. Quite different genetics, quite different IQ&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Likewise the average IQ of rural Southern Whites and the IQ of Wisconsin whites. Significantly different.</p>
<p>I will be d@mned, however, if I am going to have Tongans treated special because of their dumb &#8220;culture&#8221; if we are not going to do the same for &#8220;dumb whites&#8221;  in a country that those &#8220;dumb whites&#8221; fought and died for.  Scr*w the Tongans.  </p>
<p>Go to the back of the bus with the rest of us Hillbilly-Americans.  If they don&rsquo;t set up a special &#8220;dumb white culture&#8221; affirmative action for us, I will be d@mned if they are going to set up some special &#8220;dumb Asian culture&#8221; affirmative action for you Tongans.</p>

<p>Be thankful - hell, be VERY thankful - that the United States isn&rsquo;t importing as many Pacific Islanders as possible because &#8220;The United States is a nation in the Pacific&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Pacific Islander? Would someone who lives on Tiburón or on Santa Catalina have the right to declare the status of Pacific Islander?</p>

<p>California IS considered part of the Pacific Rim and is allowing unfettered immigration from Pacific Islanders, especially the Philippines.  Been to a hospital in California lately?  MANY of the nurses are Tagalog-speaking Filipinas   &mdash;  my relatives who are doctors tell me that once they get into managerial positions they ONLY HIRE THEIR OWN, White nurses be damned.</p>
<p>We have large ethno-centric (many White-hating) entitlement-draining populations in LA from Hawaii (native Hawaiians), Samoa, Tonga, and the Philippines replete with their various gangs and criminal activities. </p>
<p>Many of them are poor students, poorly behaved and ill-suited to the strictures and demands of the educational system.  Easier to form advocacy groups and demand hand-outs from Whites.</p>
<p>One more nail in California&rsquo;s demise  &mdash;  14 billion in debt and counting&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;if not for the hijacking of the country by elements that deemed fractionalizing this nation would guarantee their safety, too dense to know or care that they were contributing to its demise&hellip;it is this seditious group that must be publicly tried in order to air their crimes for all humanity to see&hellip;&#8221;</p>

Yes, they don&rsquo;t seem to realize that what they have demanded and created will destroy all of us, them included. </p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ve posted this before but it is a run down of who was behind this country&rsquo;s unfortunate 1965 immigration policy that put us on the road to ruin and will make Whites a minority in the country that they created by 2050 (some say 2030, some say sooner, but it WILL happen). </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a rebuttal to this article, but then Professor McDonald is known for his meticulous research.</p>

			<p>Believe me, the Japanese people do not consider themselves &#8220;the same&#8221; as &#8220;Pacific islanders&#8221; at all! Even though the various home islands of Japan all lie in the Pacific ocean too.</p>

<p>Oh they realize very well, alright, don&rsquo;t kid yourself. And it won&rsquo;t destroy them, believe me. Don&rsquo;t forget that jews have had centuries of experience dealing with European whites and know their psychology better than the whites do themselves. Their knowledge of whites is cumulative, whereas the reverse is not true   &mdash;   every generation of whites forgets what their forefathers have learned about jews by hard experience. Thus they repeat the same errors over and over again. They jews really do not see their destiny tied to that of whites; in fact they never have.  How can they, and still maintain a separate identity? - those are two mutually exclusive ideas. If anything, things have progressed to such an irreversibly stage in the European nations, that the jewish destiny is now more closely tied to that of the east asians - China, Japan, etc. They actually are a good match for each other.</p>

			<p>All of the ills of America are caused by the &#8220;other&#8221; races. By others, I mean the races that aren&rsquo;t white, Jewish, or Northeast Asian. </p>
<p>Blacks, Hispanics, Indians (both east and American), Arabs, and others cause America&rsquo;s problems. </p>
<p>If America consisted of only whites, Jews, and Northeast Asians (Japanese, Chinese, Koreans), America would remain the world superpower for the next five hundred years. </p>
<p>Incidentally, should this be the case, the majority of people in American jails would be whites. The majority of divorces and single-parenthood would be from white people. The most murders would be done by whites. </p>

			<p>Certainly Japanese do not consider themselves the same as Pacific Islanders. They look down on Filipinos, but also on Koreans, Chinese, Vietnamese and Khmers. Filipinos are regarded as the &#8220;n-s of Asia&#8221; in Japan.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Japanese are one of the people on Earth that is most closely related to Aborigines. This is because the Ainu are an Aborigine-like people, and Japanese are about 1/2 Ainu.</p>
<p>Filipinos are not much problem in California and we surely do not allow unfettered immigration from the Philippines. Much of that country wants to come here and they cannot get in. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to get a visa period from the Philippines, even a tourist visa! We do allow Filipinos in, but we are quite particular about them. Filipinos are one of the highest functioning immigrant groups in the US. They have a low crime rate, high income, have good jobs and high education level. There is not much problem with Filipino gangs.</p>
<p>Pacific Islanders are not much of a problem here either. There are just not many of them. Where I live in Central CA, I think I have only seen one PI in 17 years. I think he is Chamorro, but denied it when I asked him. He&rsquo;s the manager of a supermarket. There are some Samoans and Tongans down by LA, but not many. They are in the Harbor area and do not cause tremendous problems. I  taught them in school for years. </p>
<p>There are also quite a few of them in Compton. If you are even stuck in Compton, you do well to be around PI&rsquo;s as opposed to the Hispanics or Blacks. Yes there are PI gangs, but they don&rsquo;t really do much because there is such a small number of these people here. They are very strong though and you do not want to mess with them. They are very good natured and easy-going and much less quick to irrational anger as Blacks. I would rather have PI&rsquo;s here than even Mexicans. PI crime rate and violent crime rate is way lower than Mexicans.</p>
<p>Almost all Hawaiians are in Hawaii, not California.</p>
<p>State is in debt due to housing crisis caused by reactionary capitalist morons. California is the world&rsquo;s 8th largest economy and it&rsquo;s not failing by any means.</p>

			<p>This is why I am so dead set against the highly misleading manufactured term &#8220;Asian.&#8221;  My Russian great-grandfather was certainly Asian in the strictest sense, but no one would have mistaken him for a Japanese or Chinese.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asian&#8221; is a geographical locator, not a racial description   &mdash;   which is probably why the PC crowd prefers it to the previous, much more accurate, &#8220;Oriental.&#8221;  Describe a person as &#8220;Oriental,&#8221; and we know it means the people of northeast Asia   &mdash;   the Chinese, Japanese and Koreans.  But the word &#8220;Asian&#8221; is supposed to encompass Pacific Islanders, true Orientals, Pakistanis, Indians and a whole lineup of assorted subgroups.  The term &#8220;Asian&#8221; is meant to obfuscate, and it bothers me to see racially-aware Whites playing the enemy&rsquo;s game by using it.<br/>

			<p>Someone beat me to the punch in saying that terms like &#8220;Asian&#8221; and &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; are utterly meaningless but it bears repeating: The terms &#8220;Asian&#8221; and &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; are more misleading than anything else.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;Asian&#8221; runs the gamut from the Japanese and some Chinese and Koreans at the top, to Hmong, Laotians and whatever else at the bottom, with massive disparities in-between.  Same with &#8220;Hispanics,&#8221; who can be as blonde/blue as the purest German or as squat and brown as the common Mexi-fornian mestizo (complete with 10% African admixture). Their race is the deciding factor as to the individual worth of any of these peoples.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who lives in a city with a large &#8220;Asian&#8221; population   &mdash;   the Vietnamese and Cambodian areas are as third-world as any black ghetto.  And Koreans have massive gambling and drinking pathologies that soak up a considerable amount of public resources.  </p>
<p>And even among the intelligent Asians, their minds tend to work well for some things and not so well for others.  Take the legal profession; there are almost no asian attorneys, and the very few that exist are primarily real estate closers.  The 3 worst litigators I&rsquo;ve ever faced were U.S.-born Koreans.  They simply could not think creatively to see issues and defenses that favored their clients (who, of course, were also Korean).</p>

			<p>8:57 is correct. Asian is indeed a geo description and not a racial description. S Indians are absolutely Caucasians in every sense of the word, yet they are bizarrely classed as Asians. It is true that they are close to Asians, but so are Jews, Turks, Iranians and lots of others. Asian is a racial description but it is so huge that it would ecompass NE Asians, SE Asians, Amerindians, Pacific Islanders, Papuans and Aborigines. Obviously not every useful on government census forms. Amerindians are closer to NE Asians in general than Pacific Islaners are. The gap between NE Asians and SE Asians is wider than the gap between Caucasians and NE Asians! Logically, we would do well to split NE Asians and SE Asians on census forms, but there would be a lot of outcry.</p>
<p>Logically, NE Asians, SE Asians and Pacific Islanders (Melanesians, Micronesians and Polynesians) are all separate, vast major races.</p>
