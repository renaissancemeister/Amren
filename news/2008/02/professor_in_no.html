						<p>A Columbia University professor who was the apparent target of a hate crime last October, when a noose was left on her office door, has been sanctioned for plagiarism, university officials confirmed today. The plagiarism investigation of the professor, Madonna G. Constantine of Teachers College, was reported today by The Columbia Spectator. This afternoon, she called the investigation &#8220;biased and flawed&#8221; and accused the university of a &#8220;witch hunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A memo sent to faculty members by Susan H. Fuhrman, the president of Teachers College, and Thomas James, the provost, stated:<br>
<blockquote>A year-and-a-half long investigation has found that Professor Madonna Constantine in a number of instances used the work of three others, a former TC professor and two former students, without attribution. Professor Constantine has been sanctioned by the College. Professor Constantine has the right under College statutes to appeal to the Faculty Advisory Committee. We express the appreciation of the College to former TC Professor Christine Yeh and to the former students, Tracy Juliao and Karen Cort, for their cooperation. We are also grateful that these charges were brought to the attention of the College.</blockquote></p>
<p>The university said in a statement:<br>
<blockquote>Teachers College of Columbia University confirmed today that it has sanctioned Professor Madonna Constantine after an internal investigation found numerous instances in which she used others&rsquo; work without attribution in papers she published in academic journals over the past five years. The investigation, which began in 2006, was prompted by complaints from students and one former faculty member who said language from materials they wrote was included without attribution in the articles.</blockquote></p>
<p>The investigation, which was conducted by Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed, a law firm with a substantial practice representing universities and academic institutions, concluded that Professor Constantine&rsquo;s explanation for the strikingly similar language was not credible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a statement sent by email this afternoon to Teachers College students and faculty members, Dr. Constantine called the investigation &#8220;biased and flawed,&#8221; saying that it, coupled with &#8220;other incidents that have happened to me at Teachers College in recent months, point to a conspiracy and witch-hunt by certain current and former members of the Teachers College community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am left to wonder whether a white faculty member would have been treated in such a publicly disrespectful and disparaging manner,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;As one of only two tenured Black women full professors at Teachers College, it pains me to conclude that I have been specifically and systematically targeted.&#8221;</p>

										<p>
						<p>(CBS/AP) A Columbia University professor whose colleagues found a noose hanging from her office doorway has plagiarized the work of others, the school says. Madonna G. Constantine denies the finding and says the accusation is racially motivated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Constantine&rsquo;s lawyer, Paul J. Giacomo Jr., said his client could prove her innocence and called the school&rsquo;s investigation "extremely underhanded from the beginning." He said he would appeal the sanctions, which neither side would disclose.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a written statement, Constantine said she had been subjected to "a conspiracy and witch-hunt by certain current and former members of the Teachers College community."</p>
<p>Her lawyer said she had "clearly" been targeted because of her race, and he said he believed the noose incident and the plagiarism investigation might be linked.</p>
<p>"There&rsquo;s been an effort to intimidate my client, that&rsquo;s clear," Giacomo said.</p>
<p>Horowitz [Teachers College spokeswoman Marcia Horowitz] dismissed Giacomo&rsquo;s claims, saying "it is both absurd and untrue that racism had anything to do with this report."</p>
<p>"Teacher&rsquo;s College has zero tolerance for racism, discrimination or prejudice of any kind," she said.</p>
<p>Columbia said some of the plagiarized work was written by Christine Yeh, a former colleague of Constantine&rsquo;s who is now with the University of San Francisco.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police at the time ruled out any possibility that Constantine had hung the rope herself. A few weeks later, a swastika was discovered on the door of a Jewish professor at Teachers College.</p>

Posted by James at 3:42 PM on March 2 </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of proportion: There are more whites writing than blacks. But plagiarism among blacks is quite common: &#8220;Roots&#8221; turned out to be plagiarized fiction (not even historically accurate): Alex Haley was sued and ended up having to settle. <br>
<span class="caps">MLK </span>plagiarized his thesis.</p>

<p>NO! A White would have simply been fired on the spot and not even been bothered with being &#8220;publicly disrespected&#8221; or &#8220;disparaged.&#8221;  </p>

					<p>One reason, perhaps the most powerful, that Bantus world-wide are attracted to Islam is that Islam also does not blame itself for its sins, or admit to wrongdoing. Muslims always portray themselves as victims wronged by others, be they Jews, the British, the West, the United States, etc. They ask themselves, &#8220;What have they done to us?&#8221;, <span class="caps">NEVER </span>&#8220;What have we done&#8221;? The soul-searching commmon in Christianity, is absent in Islam. And yet, it&rsquo;s the Christian denominations largely resposible for the importation of Bantus from 3rd-World enlaves like Somalia, Congo, Rwanda, Nigeria, etc.   </p>

					<p>&#8220;those who are suprised that a prof. would plagerize students -they do it all the time - they give advanced classes a classroom &lsquo;assignment&rsquo; that in reality is unpaid research - the use the &lsquo;a&rsquo; papers&hellip;one teacher I knew in high school mentioned that one prof. of hers did it to the point of assigning different aspects of the topic to each student&hellip;and it turned out this corresponded with the chapters of the book the prof. &lsquo;wrote&rsquo;.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I would encourage any of AmRen&rsquo;s readers that are over age 40 to return to night school. The fun you can have screwing with these people is well worth the price of admission. Especially is there is a classroom full of young mushheads to listen to you shooting down the &#8220;perfesser&rsquo;s&#8221; so-called expertise.</p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;That&rsquo;s because we are all forced to accept the <span class="caps">LIE.</span> That being the reason blacks are dysfunctional, obnoxious, and violent, etc., is solely due white racism.</p>
<p>Seems to me, the poster above is somewhat confused on the issue he is quoting. The endless litany of Black perpetrated crime speaks for itself. As does the endless screams of &#8216;racism&#8221; whenever a Black is charged for a crime. So why then, unsigned poster, should we <span class="caps">NOT </span>see the Black race as dysfunctional, obnoxious and violent. Given the many millions of valid examples of Blacks fitting those very terms. Actions that speak louder, clearer than any lie.</p>
<p>As to being <span class="caps">LIE </span>we&rsquo;re forced to accept? Firstly that White racism makes Blacks act that way is an absurdity in itself. Blacks could never rise above their basic low mentality. A primtive, base  mentality seemingly as much a part of them as their skin tone.</p>
<p>Blacks, singly or collectively, simply do not want to be held accountable to the same standards we Whites are. All denials notwithstanding. They want and do play the race card at the slightest pretext. Like that shoddy excuse of a &#8220;professor.&#8221; The same old &#8220;yus wudn&rsquo;t accuse her of anything if she wuz white.&#8221; </p>
<p>Blacks even claim to find racism in setting professional standards. That Black would-be attorney in Houston, a couple of years back. Screaming the high standards for passing the bar were unrealistic, infair to Blacks. Think about that: Who would want a Black laywer sheuld the need for one arise, given the Black lawyer was basically so incompetent and unintelligent he had to have the standards <span class="caps">LOWERED </span>so he, a Black, could pass? Conversely, who would want to be treated by a Black doctor who could not pass the same professional tests White medical school students pass?</p>
<p>Look at <span class="caps">ANY </span>city with a Black for a Mayor   &mdash;   New Orleans, Detroit, Washington, Philadelphia   &mdash;   just to name a few. Invariably the Black mayor turns out to be inept, incompetent, corrupt as the truth surfaces, item by item. Take that Congressman Jefferson, from Louisiana, and his acceptance of bribes.</p>
<p>Also look to &#8220;modern&#8221; Africa. With Blacks, that&rsquo;s right, Black Africans killing, raping, mutilating and torturing each other. Even using <span class="caps">CANNIABALISM </span>as an instrument of terror. No, nothing new. Nothing that they haven&rsquo;t been doing to each other since the Black race first appeared. All those fine sounding phrases   &mdash;   to what great glories, great heights they&rsquo;d rise, given their independence from their hated European rulers. Then look at Zimbabwe, South Africa, somalia, Ethiopia.</p>
<p>History defines the opinion people have of Blacks. Not &#8220;lies.&#8221; History written by the actions, crimes, misdeeds of Blacks It makes no difference, whether the millions of Black criminals are in Africa, Europe, or the Americas. Their actions define the African race more eloquently than words ever could.</p>
<p>White racism the cause? Don&rsquo;t make me laugh! Like I pointed out, <span class="caps">REALITY AND HISTORY </span>define Blacks. Not now, not ever, something called racism!</p>

<p>Thanks for an overly long and entirely irrelevant post.  Your argument basically boils down to the same tired argument we always hear about crime - &#8220;white people do it to.&#8221; Apparently, you failed to realize that the point of the article was to point out the double standard in the way this woman was treated versus how a white man would have been treated, not to say that she plagarized because she was black.  <br>

<p>Whites weaken their social position in society by cowering, accepting, and acquiesing to the lie. On the other hand, blacks get stronger, bolder, and more beligerante from it because they eat, sleep, drink, and take <span class="caps">FULL </span>advantage of it.  <br>

					<p>Yes, professors very often use the work of their students in preparing books and papers, but, crucially, that help is usually limited to directed research tasks and cite-checking, not the actual writing of the manuscript (if the student does write a substantial part, co-authorship is appropriate).  The bedrock principle here is that the person who actually writes the words - who composes the original work - is the essential author, no matter who did the research or even came up with the general idea in the first place.  (There is a reason most papers have a &#8220;credits&#8221; section!)</p>
<p>More debatable is the practice of professors claiming co-authorship on student papers, even those in which a professor contributed only advice and editorial supervision.  There seems to be a whole unexplored realm here as this article indicates:</p>

<p>Either way, Constantine&rsquo;s plagiarism was so outstandingly egregious and shameless - virtually rubbing it in the faces of her own students and colleagues - that in this instance, Columbia had no choice but to act.</p>

					<p>Of course she doesn&rsquo;t try to refute the charges, she just expresses outrage that she was ever investigated to begin with. </p>
<p>as for the portion that states </p>
<p>�I am left to wonder whether a white faculty member would have been treated in such a publicly disrespectful and disparaging manner,�</p>
<p>Gee maybe could that be because any self respecting professor caught stealing from their <span class="caps">STUDENT</span>s with the slightest bit of dignity would quietly submit their resignation rather than force the school to restort to taking things this far.  </p>

					<p>those who are suprised that a prof. would plagerize students -they do it all the time - they give advanced classes a classroom &#8216;assignment&rsquo; that in reality  is unpaid research - the use the &#8216;a&rsquo; papers&hellip;one teacher I knew in high school mentioned that one prof. of hers did it to the point of assigning different aspects of the topic to each student&hellip;and it turned out this corresponded with the chapters of the book the prof. &#8216;wrote&rsquo;.  </p>

					<p>Wait, so some of you actually think she plagiarized her student because she was black? She&rsquo;s not the first person to steal a student&rsquo;s work, and, unfortunately, she won&rsquo;t be the last. &#8220;Getting What You Came For: The Smart Student&rsquo;s Guide to Earning an <span class="caps">M.A. </span>or a Ph.D.&#8221; by Peter Roberts provides anecdotes of advisors stealing their students&rsquo; work, taking credit for their students&rsquo; discoveries, etc. And these professors racial background run the gamut, mostly white by the way (however the race of the perpetrator is meaningless to me). And neither of these guys lost their jobs or got fired. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to fire a professor once he/she receives tenure, which is why getting tenure is very difficult. </p>
<p>As one closely linked with academia, it&rsquo;s not uncommon to hear of professors taking credit for and stealing their students work. Not too long ago a student discovered her (Asian) professor filed for a patent without including her name using techniques she (the student) developed during her PhD. She sued her professor and won. Complaints by students regarding their professors stealing their work aren&rsquo;t hard to find in academia. It&rsquo;s been done before, <i>and it&rsquo;s race-independent</i>. See Danut Marcu, John Darsee (a Harvard scientist), Hwang Woo-Suk (famous episode), Charles Dawson (who claimed fake discoveries), etc.</p>
<p>Another common trend is this: a PhD student or, sometimes, a post-doctoral fellow, contributes to a field, and when the paper is written, the advisor adds his name without contributing anything meaningful to the paper. Not all advisors do this by the way, but it&rsquo;s not uncommon to find. With the amount of power given to professors, many of these cases go unheard, but graduate students, post-docs and professors witness them but just keep shut. And universities often go a long way to protect their staff and thus their names, unless in patent cases. Oh, the underbelly of academia!</p>
<p>Just last year, a postdoctoral fellow from China plagiarized the &ldquo;Proposed Methods&rdquo; section of a grant word-for-word. It took a review by an independent panel familiar with the field to figure it out. And having worked with this post-doctoral fellow, he&rsquo;s experimentally adept in applying molecular biology to neuroscience. Do we inordinately ascribe him with a low IQ and being awarded a PhD because of his race? </p>
<p>With the intense competition, and the quest for fame and intellectual regard in academia being a big deal, professors are sometimes &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; to become exploitative of their students; students are sometimes pushed to do unseemly things as well (they aren&rsquo;t exempt). A stellar MD/PhD student, Amitav Hajra, at University of Michigan fabricated data mercilessly during his PhD years. It was uncovered and the PhD was revoked. You also have to understand that getting into an MD/PhD program, especially at a top school like Michigan, is no joke. Competition is intense and blemishes on one&rsquo;s academic record can weaken your candidacy. The margin of error is small. Yet, someone who was scrutinized harshly by the regarded intelligentsia of academic medicine and science still failed us at large. Thus working with a fair and reasonable professor/student is of utmost importance. </p>
<p>Overall, what we have is an issue of integrity. Knowing it&rsquo;s wrong to plagiarize and not doing it reflect honesty, not smarts. It takes more brains to discover the transition state of an enzyme or understand Green&rsquo;s theorem in multivariable calculus than know and <i>actually implement</i> virtue. </p>

Blacks are constantly babbling about how they try to &#8220;live by da example set by Docta King&#8221;   &mdash;   and it&rsquo;s possible this Prof. Madonna Constantine is merely doing the same. </p>
<p>&#8220;Saint Martin of the Motels&#8221; has been accused of plagiarizing substantial sections of his graduate work. I seem to recall hearing the estimate that some 30% of <span class="caps">MLK&rsquo;</span>s PhD thesis in the early &rsquo;50s was lifted from a previous scholar   &mdash;   and, with the help of his indulgent white benefactors, he <span class="caps">GOT AWAY WITH IT.</span> So why wouldn&rsquo;t latter-day token-hires like Prof. Constantine think they can do the same? &#8220;If Docta King did it, it gots to be right   &mdash;   right?&#8221; </p>
<p>Coming up with your own ideas is, evidently, too much like work. So much easier just to steal.</p>
<p>And since the (alleged) noose (allegedly) hung on her (alleged) doorknob was <span class="caps">AFTER </span>the &#8220;Jena Six&#8221; debacle, even her &#8220;hate crime&#8221; may have been a form of plagiarism! <br>

					<p>Anybody else thinking that the noose incident (which I believe she hung there herself) was concocted by this professor to divert attention away from the investigation of her plagarism.</p>
<p>And how typical that another black thinks that this is all just a &#8220;witch hunt&#8221; and that a white professor would not have been so &#8220;disgracefully&#8221; disrespected.  What is that complex called when someone thinks that others are always out to get them?  I know there&rsquo;s got to be a clinical word for it.  Not only do blacks suffer from a lack of a sense of humor, they lack the ability to reason and take responsibility for their actions when they are caught red-handed.</p>

					<p>Two years ago, I received a Bachelors of Arts degree in English from a California State University school which shall remain anonymous.</p>
<p>We had a very fun and eccentric professor who was quite liberal and a member of the Green Party as well. He was a British national working on his <span class="caps">U.S. </span>citizenship. </p>
<p>About one year before graduation, he caught a black student in one of our classes plagiarising on a final paper. School policy directed faculty to report any plagiarism to the dean of the department who would then call a meeting of the department committee to investigate the charges.</p>
<p>The black student met the dean and told him that our professor was a &#8220;blatant racist&#8221; and made class so &#8220;hard&#8221; on him that he &#8220;had no choice but to plagiarise&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So, the dean met with our professor and explained the charges and our professor was then thrown into a fit of disbelief. He was mind-boggled to think someone accused his liberal-self of &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even worse, the situation was aggravated when the dean told our liberal professor to &#8220;pass the student with a C&#8221; in order to avoid potential controversy.</p>
<p>When word leaked out of what happened, all of us in the English department were horrified, of course. We were also angry! If any of us had committed this act, we would have likely been suspended for an entire semester and had our financial aid jeopardised! </p>
<p>The anger in the English department was so immense that the black student eventually dropped out of school. It turns it, English was his minor area of study while his major was&hellip;take a wild guess&hellip;&#8221;BLACK and <span class="caps">AFRICAN STUDIES</span>&#8221;!!! </p>
<p>Go figure! </p>

					<p>From the New York Times&rsquo; October 12 profile story on Madonna Constantine (apologies for quoting the Times, but this is just too good):</p>
<p><i>[Constantine] earned her Ph.D. in counseling psychology at the University of Memphis, and spent five years working in the counseling and mental health center at the University of Texas at Austin before going into academia, first at Temple University. She came to Teachers College in 1998 as an associate professor and earned tenure in 2001, with, she said, more than 30 published articles under her name.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people may go up with 15 or 20,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I figured as a black woman, I needed to at least double that.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Not only an instance or two of plagiarism here, but two dozen, including material taken from at least nine other students.   Imagine the shamelessness required to plagiarize not only from one&rsquo;s own colleagues, but from your very own students!</p>
<p>Columbia&rsquo;s own website singles out plagiarism as the cardinal sin of academia (as did my alma mater), stating that plagiarism &#8220;cannot be tolerated&#8221; and that any student who engages in it &#8220;should anticipate being asked to leave Columbia.&#8221;  <br>
 https://www.college.columbia.edu/facultyadmin/academic_integrity/.</p>
<p>To not dismiss Constantine, with a list of scholarly thefts so long that one wonders if she ever conducted any original research, makes a mockery not only of Columbia&rsquo;s integrity policies, but of the entire college itself.</p>

					<p>Hello! The investigation of Professor Constantine&rsquo;s plagiarism was initiated well <strong>before</strong> the noose incident. Doesn&rsquo;t that tell us something about who hung the noose?<br>
I am an academic in New York City and can tell you that those (like Prof. C.) with degrees from places like Xavier University in LA and the University of Memphis are regarded as bottom-feeders. They&rsquo;re both black schools with abysmal reputations. Graduates from them would never normally (?) be considered for academic positions. Such credentials would never be taken seriously under usual (?) circumstances.<br><br>
What is Columbia University Teacher&rsquo;s College doing hiring people with such qualifications? The reason is that Columbia carefully separates out TC from its other academic programs. Faculty from Columbia&rsquo;s TC aren&rsquo;t allowed (for obvious reasons) to supervise dissertations. TC is an institution designed to credential minorities in the <span class="caps">NYC </span>public school system to help them get well-paid administrative jobs.<br><br>
If you look at the statistics on minorities who get &#8220;doctorates&#8221; in the the <span class="caps">U.S., </span>almost all get them in education. In all decent universities, Ed.D.s are not considered as research degrees and do not qualify someone for tenure.<br><br>
Is this information any surprise to anyone?     </p>

					<p> How predictable that Professor Constantine immediately played the race card when caught with her hand in someone else&rsquo;s work. It&rsquo;s a knee-jerk reaction with blacks, whatever the circumstances.</p>
<p> Isn&rsquo;t it interesting too, as someone else mentioned when this story initially broke, that in both pictures shown Constantine&rsquo;s earrings bear a striking resemblance to the business end of a noose? Coincidence? Freudian slip? Hint to &#8220;those in the know&#8221; that she&rsquo;s really just &#8220;settin&rsquo; up Whitey&#8221;?</p>

					<p>So the noose incident was a distraction created by &#8220;Professor&#8221; Constantine in the hope of avoiding an investigation into her activities?</p>

					<p>Did she find the noose before or after she found out she would be cited for plagiarism?</p>

<p>I believe she found the noose before being cited for plagarism, but just before her latest book on &#8220;racism&#8221; was to be released. <br>

					<p>This is what happens when the circusmasters let these clowns write their &#8220;own&#8221; lines.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there some sort of &#8220;Martin Luther King, Jr. Award&#8221; for black plagiarists? To commemorate King&rsquo;s doctoral dissertation? A dissertation &#8220;written&#8221; back when King was writing his &#8220;own&rsquo; lines.</p>

					<p>Good grief, a &#8220;professor&#8221; plagiarising the work of her colleague and her <span class="caps">STUDENTS</span>! How desparate and humilating is that!  </p>

					<p>What sort of &#8220;scholar&#8221; plagiarizes his own students? At least &#8220;Martin Luther&#8221; King plagiarized a colleague.</p>

					<p>A racist conspiracy at Columbia University in the heart of Manhattan, New York City?  Nobody&rsquo;s buying it.</p>
