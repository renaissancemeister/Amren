						<p>&#8220;Needs to be black,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Needs to be a man,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Memphis school board member Kenneth Whalum Junior never holds back.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He would prefer to see an African-American male at the helm of Memphis City Schools above anyone else.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think when you consider our demographics, our students, the problems we&rsquo;re having with little black boys especially, there&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind,&#8221; Whalum told us.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whalum is quick to point out that a black man in the superintendent&rsquo;s office is only his preference.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if somebody stood out as a better candidate &mdash; of course I would support that person,&#8221; said Whalum.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I think when you consider our demographics, our students, the problems we&rsquo;re having with little black boys especially, there&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind (that we need a black superintendent of schools)&#8221;  &mdash;  Kenneth Whalum</p>
<p>&#8220;I think when you consider our neighborhood demographics, the caliber of our students, the problems we&rsquo;re having with black students&rsquo; disprupting and degrading the learning environment, there is no doubt in my mind that this school should be for Whites only&#8221;  &mdash;  Garvin Alfred Schmaltz</p>
<p>Of course, this could not be said. If it were, it would be denounced as the vilest racism. </p>
<p>The world is not fair  &mdash;  we must remember that, and soldier on accordingly, resisting the downward pull on our morality, integrity, and intelligence.  </p>

			<p>So predominately White areas need a White person as the superintendent and not a black.  That&rsquo;s ok right?</p>

			<p>The U.S. Congressman for the district that includes Memphis City, which is mostly black, is a white man.  I&rsquo;m sure this fact will play into the minds of those who choose the new Memphis superintendent.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I think when you consider our demographics, our students, the problems we&rsquo;re having with little black boys especially, there&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind,&rdquo; Whalum told us.</i></p>
<p>For most of the time I attended the St. Louis City Public Schools, the district had a black Superintendent.  I don&rsquo;t remember having problems learning then.</p>

			<p>Mister Whalum, I agree with you. For an all black school district, yours, all teachers and administrators SHOULD be black since only blacks can understand and relate to blacks.</p>
<p>For any all black white districts, mine, all teachers and administrators SHOULD be white since only whites can understand a relate to blacks.</p>
<p>Back to the Future, anyone? 1954, anyone? I totally agree with you, Mr. Whalum, totally. Separate but &#8220;equal&#8221; is the only moral, sane, ethical and logical way of dealing with our different human breeds. Just like Abraham Lincoln wanted as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Whalum, the problem with &#8220;little black boys&#8221; <em><b>is that they already</b></em> follow the examples left by black men.</p>

			<p>memphis city schools are over 90% black. let them have a black man for superintendent. that way they&rsquo;ll only have themselves to blame when their children can&rsquo;t read or write or count. besides, any non-black superintendent would be so horribly harrassed that he/she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get anything done anyway.</p>

			<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if a white, black, red, purple, or green man is put into this spot. It&rsquo;s the tribe mentality and low IQ of blacks that create the problems and until this is honestly addressed nothing else matters. Interestingly, &#8216;little black boys&rsquo; seem to be a significant problem in the schools. Really? I never would have guessed!!! Then they grow up and complain about mistreatment, racism, and civil rights abuses. Ask them to read at a 4th grade level, or comprehend basic societal mores, and you&rsquo;ll get blank stares. Ask them to put a sentence together without using gross profanity and it&rsquo;s nearly impossible. No one respects anyone who doesn&rsquo;t have a decent education, not even the uneducated.</p>

<p>Fine. And taxpayers of light should no longer have to pay for the school district either. All the more since children of light cannot attend due to racial harassment and violence at the hands of black students.<br>

			<p>Excellent reply, Mr. Garvin Schmaltz! I hope to see the day when sanity-and courage-returns to the true heirs of America&rsquo;s founders. We have conceded a thousand percent more to those who cannot claim that heritage and after forty years of decline and decay, I am pleased to see that there are more of us who realize the root cause of our problems than the liberal media had allowed me to realize.</p>
<p>We know why our public schools went from being the best on earth to the bottom of the barrel; we know why our cities are now practically uninhabitable; we know why once-thriving institutions are failing dismally; and we know that the so-called &#8220;elites&#8221; know as well. When do we begin to reclaim our culture and heritage, though? I pray it isn&rsquo;t too late.</p>

			<p>When in Memphis, go 2-3 blocks in any direction and you&rsquo;ll find a slum.  Through the 80s and 90s the culture shift in Memphis was astounding.  Only the hard core Memphis loving whites would dare stay in Mid-town, the rest flighted to Germantown, Bartlett and points east.  Long standing traditions like the Overton Square pub crawl are gone.  The rich Irish culture has evaporated and Memphis is more like Montgomery than ever before.  Most of the liquor stores are built like armored cars with drop boxes and bullet proof glass.  </p>
<p>And yet, they have the balls to say that a black guy is the only one who can save their schools?  Who built those schools?  Who built all of the infrastructure that is trampled down and neglected by the hoards who move in with takeover efficiency?  If this isn&rsquo;t by plan, then the Free State movement isn&rsquo;t either.  Only the people in NH aren&rsquo;t doing nearly as well as America&rsquo;s organized black steam roller as it flattens targeted white cities.  Few fight back.  </p>

<p>This is always the reasoning behind their demands; &#8216;only we know how to solve our own problems&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I can assure that after all the black board members and our current and last black head of the Buffalo School system that blacks in leadership and position of policy making only make things worse for black students.</p>
<p>When blacks are in charge of the schools, blacks students do even worse.</p>

			<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait til blacks control everything in the USA.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait til Mohamed is in Buckingham Palace, Muslims rule the parliament, mosques ring the prayer bells and Sharia is the law.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait til the whole of Europe is totally Muslim.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait to see the sorry faces of our leaders on CNN, BBC, etc etc apologizing to their new masters.</p>
<p>Then everything will be just perfect.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how BLACKS never seem to &#8220;hold back&#8221;&hellip;THEY don&rsquo;t need to&hellip;it&rsquo;s only WHITES that are FORCED to &#8220;hold back&#8221;!&hellip;if a WHITE had said &#8220;needs to be WHITE&#8221;&hellip;&#8221;needs to be a man&#8221; he would be REMOVED from his position and charged with a &#8220;hate&#8221; crime INCLUDING &#8220;hate&#8221; speech!&hellip;a WHITE would be called a RACIST and a SEXIST!</p>

<p>Gee!&hellip;why is it that demographics only count with THEM&hellip;and don&rsquo;t count when the demographics are WHITE!&hellip;BLACKS complain that they aren&rsquo;t in positions of power when they live in white majority areas&hellip;and they feel that ONLY blacks should be in positions of power in black majority areas&hellip;in other words&hellip;only BLACKS should be in positions of power&hellip;period!</p>
<p>The problems we&rsquo;re having with little black boys especially&hellip;</p>
<p>The problems with &#8220;little black boys&#8221; is that they grow up into BIG BLACK THUGS being SCHOOLED by other BIG BLACK THUGS!</p>
<p>Whalum is quick to point out that a black man in the superintendent&rsquo;s office is only his preference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if somebody stood out as a better candidate &mdash; of course I would support that person,&rdquo; said Whalum.</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip;right!&hellip;as long as they are BLACK!&hellip;with blacks it&rsquo;s ALWAYS about race&hellip;and yet, WE are the RACISTS!&hellip;funny how that works!</p>

			<p>Well, then- this guy, along with anybody who protested the white rule of South Africa because of a belief that the racial majority must rule, should accept that the president of the U.S.A. needs to be white.  </p>

			<p>This is fine by me.  Black children performed better under other black teachers during segregation anyway.  The problem is they never allow this, at least not openly, in white schools.</p>

			<p>  Happens all the time . Our 80% black public school turned down a white coach with a winning record, they wanted a black coach . While the 99.9% white, private school actually hired a black coach . Egalitarianism, the white man&rsquo;s disease .</p>

			<p>They need a black superintendent because they aren&rsquo;t listening to the black <br>
1. teachers <br>
2. teacher&rsquo;s assistants <br>
3. office staff <br>
4. disciplinary (time out room or in-house detention) staff <br>
5. playground supervision staff<br>
6. vice-principals <br>
7. principals<br>
8. counselors<br>
9. assistant superintendents<br>
and their black<br>
10. parents<br>
11. grandparents<br>
12. aunts and uncles.<br>
13. brothers and sisters.<br>
14. ministers<br>
15. neighborhood figures, like a caring neighbor&hellip;</p>
<p>I hope the superintendent has a LOT of time on his hands, because if the &#8220;little boys&#8221; aren&rsquo;t listening to anyone else in their chain of command (do they recognize a chain of command?) he&rsquo;s going to need all the time he can get to hear their demands.  And they will all insist on being treated equally, even if some of them are more well behaved than the others.</p>
