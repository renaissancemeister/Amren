						<p>SPRINGDALE &mdash; The medical community is warning the public: a leprosy outbreak in Springdale could blossom into an epidemic, if something isn&rsquo;t done soon.</p>
<p>Doctors say at least nine cases of leprosy have been confirmed in Springdale.  Local doctors say they would be shocked by even one case of leprosy in their entire career, so they say something must be done soon, in order to stop leprosy&rsquo;s spread.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Medical specialists say the Marshall Islands have the most cases of leprosy, in the world. And the city with the largest number of Marshallese people, outside the Marshall islands, is Springdale. And Bingham [Springdale MD Jennifer Bingham] says, it makes sense, then, that leprosy is spreading to the city. &#8220;It&rsquo;s from the Marshall islands; that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re seeing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bingham says without cooperation, leprosy, which has no vaccine, and is transmitted through the air, will spread, and could easily become an epidemic. &#8220;People absolutely should be concerned. What I&rsquo;m afraid of, is when people start thinking about it enough, it will already be out of control.&#8221;</p>
<p>So now, Bingham, and others like Mayoral candidate Nancy Jenkins, say government help is the next step. Jenkins says she&rsquo;s angered the federal government has been so lax with border patrol. She says, &#8220;We&rsquo;ve just opened the borders and said, &lsquo;Come on in! Bring your diseases! Bring &lsquo;em!&rsquo; Why are we doing that? Those who have it need to be quarantined and treated, or sent back to their country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

															<h2><a href="http://www.kfsm.com/Global/story.asp?S=7845322">AR Dept of Health Debunks Leprosy Fears</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>KFSM-TV (Fort Smith, Arkansas), February 8, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>SPRINGDALE &mdash; The Arkansas Department of Health in Little Rock says some Northwest Arkansas doctors have wrong information that&rsquo;s leading them to fears of leprosy cases. </p>
<p>The health department tells 5News because leprosy is such a rare disease, some Arkansas doctors often don&rsquo;t have the most up-to-date information on it. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Springdale Doctor Jennifer Bingham] contends people should be very concerned about contracting the disease. But the Arkansas Department of Health says: not true.</p>
<p>Officials argue there should be no cause for concern about a leprosy outrbreak or epidemic in Northwest Arkansas.</p>
<p>Dr. James Phillips, an infectious disease expert with the Arkansas Department of Health, says only five percent of the population is susceptible to the disease. He says leprosy is not as contagious as a lot of people think it is. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Phillips says the latest medical information shows only five percent of the population is suceptible to leprosy, which is typically spread through close contact with mucous or other bodily fluids, over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Because of these reasons, the health department wants to correct misinformed doctors, or concerned citizens, to say: a leprosy epidemic cannot occur.<br>

			<p>As is blatantly obvious, until either:<br>
1. ALL &#8220;Third-World&#8221; immigration, legal and illegal, ends, or<br>
2. ALL &#8220;Third-World&#8221; diseases are eradicated, this is only going to worsen in the future, with hospitals buckling under the strain of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>We know which one is feasible, and which one isn&rsquo;t.</p>

			<p>&#8220;So now, Bingham, and others like Mayoral candidate Nancy Jenkins, say government help is the next step.&#8221;  Yes, there you have the routine knee-jerk reaction from your political elite, NW Arkansas. Just bring in MORE GOVERNMENT! Why, of course, that&rsquo;s it. Government will take care of the problem. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re there for, right? Problem is, GOVERNMENT is responsible for being IRRESPONSIBLE by NOT being tough on immigration! The Leprosy problem did not start in Arkansas, it started at our borders which &#8220;our GOVERNMENT&#8221; is doing ZILCH to plug up. And, other than Ron Paul every other candidate would swing the door open even wider.  Look at the Bozos lining up behind McBomber, Romney (gone for now), Huckleberry, Hillary, Obama. It almost makes one wish for more disease and pestilence to descend upon the politically/culturally ignorant in order to teach them a hard lesson, but then we&rsquo;d suffer along with them. Just how disastrous must it get before Boobus Americanus wakes up and figures it out!?</p>

			<p>Dr. Bingham said that she had no problems with Marshall Islanders migrating here, as long as there were medical tests.</p>
<p>Question for her:  If it&rsquo;s wrong to have race restrictions on immigration, then isn&rsquo;t it just as &#8220;bigoted&#8221; against the ill to have medical tests?</p>
<p>Lou Dobbs took a lot of heat from Morris Moneybags and his &#8220;Center&#8221; for linking leprosy to immigration.  Turns out Lou was right.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m from Arkansas and this is the first I&rsquo;ve heard of this story. It is amazing how little the MSM these days cares about actually informing people of what is going on.  I&rsquo;m sure if this story was about a group of Swedish immigrants giving a few people the flu it would be front page news though.</p>

And, from a different conference:<br>
 <br>
According to Bates there are 8,000 (legal) Marshalleese immigrants in Springdale. They&rsquo;re the most unhealthy immigrant group in the state, known to suffer from TB, VD, and leprosy. Not a single case of the latter has been cured. </p>
<p>Bates also said that, in contrast to Hawaii, which has $10 million federal dollars for its Micronesian population, Arkansas gets nothing for its Marshall Islanders.</p>
<p>Deputy State Health Officer Dr. Joe Bates testified that between 2000 and 2005, Northwest Arkansas had nine cases of congenital syphilis, six of which involved Marshallese; 38 people with infectious syphilis, 21 of whom were Marshallese; and eight cases of leprosy, all Marshallese&hellip; </p>
<p>&hellip;&#8221;We think there are two to three times more cases of leprosy than we know about,&#8221; he said&hellip;</p>

			<p>WHAT???   Marshall Islanders in Arkansas!?!?!</p>
<p>What possible reason would they have for being in Arkansas?  <br>
And with the highest rate of leprosy in the world too!</p>
<p>First it was Somalis in Maine, then Ethipoians in Minnesota, then Darfur &#8220;refugees&#8221; in South Dakota. Now this! </p>
<p>What do they all have in common?   Well, I do believe northwestern Arkansas is very white, is it not?  <br>
Too white, I guess. Something had to be done about it.</p>

			<p>According to that bird&rsquo;s-brained woman who heads the National Council of The [Mestizo] Race, any suggestion that immigrants bring leropsy to that U.S. is a case of &#8220;hate speech&#8221; and should be strictly prohibited.<br>

			<p><i>Dr. Phillips says the latest medical information shows only five percent of the population is susceptible to leprosy, which is typically spread through close contact with mucous or other bodily fluids, over a long period of time.</i></p>
<p>I read up on Leprosy two years ago for a class, and I&rsquo;ve never heard about this 5% susceptibility before.  I suspect &#8220;recent research&#8221; really means one uncorroborated study that the doctor is citing for PC bonus points.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well established that Leprosy is contagious through contact.   It is also hard to detect and treat - the early symptoms are subtle and most cases in 1st world countries are misdiagnosed until the disease is advanced.  It is a gruesome and disabling illness.  Would you like your kids in school with contagious carriers??  </p>
<p>The fact that it is transmissible through contact should not comfort the White population of Arkansas.  Most 3rd world immigrants have &#8220;substandard&#8221; hygiene practices and do not understand how disease is transmitted through mucus and other bodily fluids.  </p>
<p>Hygiene ignorance is not always related to poverty, either.  I used to belong to a $175/mo athletic club in a financial center where wealthy Asian immigrants picked their noses in open areas and blew snot into sinks.  One day while I was changing, an immigrant woman with a obvious head cold spent <b>more than 10 minutes</b> blowing snot into a granite sink in the dressing room.  I almost vomited!  After that I decided by money was best spent on a cheap club further away from my office&hellip;  </p>

<p>As for that screeching Janet La Raza and her so-called &#8220;hate speech&#8221;&hellip;  Lou was indeed right.  Leprosy has arrived in America!</p>
<p>Also, as one commentator said on Lou&rsquo;s show&hellip;  &#8220;Janet talks a lot about the consequences of &#8220;hate speech&#8221; but completely ignores the consequences of illegal immigration.&#8221;  </p>
<p>And leprosy just happens to be one of these wonderful consequences&hellip;</p>

			<p>Immigration policy is simply about increasing the number of consumers.  </p>
<p>The aging baby boom generation is the best thing that can happen to us, after 40 years or more of sustained growth. It doesn&rsquo;t please the banks or multinationals, who pressure government to bring in immigrants to pump up their earnings.</p>

			<p>As Marshall Islands are a US territory, I assume they can pretty much immigrate here anytime they want to. It&rsquo;s not like they are coming from a foreign country. If we don&rsquo;t like that, we can always set the Marshalls free, which I think we should have done long ago anyway. Same with Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and all the rest.</p>

			<p>     I am from Springdale, and the city government there in the last ten to fifteen years has heavily encouraged non-White immigration, especially Mexican and those from the Marshall Islands.  Twenty years ago, Springdale was nearly 100% White.  Now, if you do not include the suburbs, it is probably 60% non-White.  I noticed on the T.V. news this morning, that the state health department is putting on announcements that there &#8220;is nothing to worry about&#8221; concerning leprosy.  Which of course means that there very much is something to worry about.  The Marshallese here are well known to have lots of cases of TB, etc.</p>

<p>No. The idiotic Marshall Islanders are to blame for not seeking medical help right away as they are literally all one big welfare case. The US taxpayer covers their medical care and just about everything else in their little paradise. They are here because the people who now control the US government hate whites and want us marginalized or destroyed. It&rsquo;s obvious the US government is behind dumping third worlders in the whitest area of the country just as it&rsquo;s obvious the US &#8220;government&#8221; is busy helping the hordes from South of our border get here in the first place. </p>

			<p>According to my own research, leprosy is a bacterium and is one of the most least likely diseases to be transmitted between humans by casual contact. Apparantly, anyone infected with leprosy will not fall victim to malaria, although I doubt if this will be of much comfort to those who already suffer from one or the other. Crocodiles do not die from malaria or leprosy so maybe this is a lesson for those of us who are thinking of a quick dip into the river Nile or the waters of the everglades. Crocodiles don&rsquo;t use drugs or firearms and do not wear &#8216;bling&rsquo; or drive silly cars with lit-up wheels but are much less dangerous than those reptiles that cruise our city streets. Perhaps therein lies a lesson from nature??  </p>

Posted by Da Vinci</p>
<p>If anything &hellip; I would prefer to go with Robert Lindsay&rsquo;s simple solution to this.</p>
<p>The federal govt. should cut them free -   and ought to have done so  <i>long ago, </i> in my opinion.  Same for the others that Robert mentioned. Most of them please only the sugar and pineapple interests, the banks, and the military   &mdash;    while the rest of us suffer the consequences of imperialism. As for the tourism, that will still be there; places like Puerto Rico are not going to sink into the sea when the US navy leaves.</p>
<p>When the US became an  (undeclared) empire in 1898, to please the Hearst newspaper and financial interests, that was the worst thing that could have happened to us.  We should have been lucky enough to  <i>lose </i> the Spanish-American War!   Instead, the Spanish got lucky and lost their possessions. They had no idea at that time what a blessing it would prove to be.  Otherwise, they would now be suffering the same imperial backwash that  the British, French, and Dutch are going through.  But no, we&rsquo;re getting it instead.</p>

<p>I thought that might be the case when I first read the article but wasn&rsquo;t sure, so I did a little digging. Turns out it&rsquo;s not true. The Marshall Islands are a sovereign republic. It&rsquo;s nearby, uninhabited Wake Island (to which the Marshall Islands lays claim) that&rsquo;s a US territory. </p>

Good point.  It&rsquo;s a trifle off-topic, but apposite here, I think, to mention this (especially since it has been brought up):  Have you ever noticed, when the periodic discussions about Puerto Rican statehood or independence come up, how there is a great deal of debate about what the Puerto Ricans want?  Yet, no one EVER suggests asking the American public what WE want!   </p>
<p>Joining the Union is sort of a marriage. And according to Abe Lincoln, it&rsquo;s &#8220;til death do us part.&#8221;   In any valid marriage, or any business contract, BOTH parties are asked if they assent.   Whoever  heard of a marriage where only one partner was asked to give consent?</p>

			<p>8,000 Marshallese in ONE little town?  According to what I could find online, that is equal to 13% of the entire population of the islands.  And HOW, pray tell, did they end up in Arkansas of their own volition?  Why not stop in Hawaii - it&rsquo;s warmer, closer to home, and you have to transfer through there to get to anywhere else in the USA anyways. </p>
<p>There is way more here than is being told.</p>

			<p>I lived in NW Arkansas for 2 years.  You can bet that Tyson foods have something to do with this.  They imported folks to work for them.  Hispanics being the largest and Lord knows who else.  It was common knowledge among the locals.</p>
<p>I left back in 2000 when it was just &#8220;The Real McCoys and pepino&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thank goodness I bailed when I did.  I wonder how Silver Dollar City and Branson will deal with this.  You ought to take a look at employment records of that whole place&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

			<p>Hmmmm, I wonder why the US was able to eradicate so many diseases from 1920-1965.  Think it had anything to do with the fact that immigration rates were historically low back then? Furthermore, the US started to allow vast amounts of third world/tropical immigration only after 1965. The tropics are the most diseased places on the earth.</p>
<p>Only with the insanity of PC/Multi-culturalism can a once first-rate country like the US suddenly forget about something as simple as basic public health and safety.</p>

			<p>The United States should never have embarked on its imperial march in 1898. I can&rsquo;t for the very life of me see what contribution Peurto Rico makes to the lives of average Americans. Why did the U.S. need to waste men and money for 50 years in the Phillipinnes? All this did was ensure war with Japan would be unavoidable in 1941. All the various little islands and atolls that the U.S. acquired throughout the Pacific have been nothing but a huge drain on American taxpayers. How does owning Samoa improve the life of an American in Iowa? Even making Hawaii a state was a bad mistake. It is an awkward fit at best as an American state. It would be much better if the U.S. dissolved its empire and abandoned the Pax American hegemony that it has tried to impose. It was this thinking that led directly to the fiasco of the Iraq invasion. </p>

<p>Even I had to look it up.  Somebody SENT them there. As you say, there&rsquo;s more here than is being told.  They were DUMPED on the local population.<br>

			<p>There are legal immigration &#8220;companies&#8221; out there that are funded by the government to bring the third world to our great country.  This is why we have all the Somalis, Hmong, and now these Marshall Islanders.  They automatically become citizens, are handed all the welfare benefits, and get to vote for all the nice whiteys that let them come here.  Of course how can this country expect assimilation from these tribal people.  It just their culture after all.  America&rsquo;s culture means nothing.</p>

RSJ</p>
<p>And the tropics also happen to be the most non-white places on earth.  Furthermore, diseases like leprosy are only what can be seen on the surface.  As has been covered here before, these people arrive loaded with disgusting internal parasites, which show no external sign, and then they spread these lovely gifts of diversity about.   </p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re supposed to grateful for this &#8220;enrichment&#8221; to our culture!  Well, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re told anyway.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right. Americans are never consulted about what we want.  Everything is about what&rsquo;s good for the Puerto Ricans!   Well, what about what&rsquo;s good for us? It&rsquo;s simply assumed that we want to &#8220;marry&#8221; Puerto Rico.  But was anyone ever asked?</p>

			<p>Of course it does not help by people like Jay Leno always joking on states like Arkansas and other Anglo enclaves to suggest low intelligence and unusual behaviors when we all know the target is way off and Anglo culture has produced more good people than nearly all other cultures combined.  Other races see divisions within White America and exploit them.</p>

			<p>To clarify, the Marshall Islands came under American control when the U.S. seized them from the Japanese in bloody battles during World War II.  From 1947 to 1986, the islands were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands with the United States as the administering authority under a mandate from the United Nations.  Atomic tests were undertaken at Bikini and Eniwetok in the 1950s, and the U.S. built a large missile testing facility on Kwajalein atoll which operates to this day.  Annual lease payments in millions of dollars for use of the base go to the Marshall island government.  In 1986, the Marshallese approved a so-called Compact of Free Association which gave them a semi-autonomous status, with the United States responsible for defense matters.  While the islanders are not U.S. citizens, they can travel freely to and work legally in the United States.</p>
<p>As to the question of why these islanders choose Arkansas over Hawaii?  The simple answer: Employment and cost of living considerations.  And if you didn&rsquo;t know already, many of the chicken-processing plants in Arkansas actively recruit Marshallese and other nearby islanders (Micronesians) because the islanders are generally well-educated and speak English.</p>
<p>Finally, if anybody wonders how the leprosy spread among Marshallese, they need only visit to the island enclaves of Majuro and Ebeye.  Both have long been called the &#8220;slums of the Pacific&#8221; due to overcrowding and poor sanitation - a situation which has been perennial embarrassment for the United States.</p>

			<p>The Marshall Islands is indeed a politically independent country, but one that is heavily dependent on U.S. government grants that are provided through a &#8220;Compact of Free Association&#8221; that is in effect through 2023. Marshall Islanders are NOT US citizens (unless they are born in the US). The Compact provides them with visa-free entry to the US to study, work and live. The immigration and aid benefits are provided in exchange for US use of an important missile testing base at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, which has been the center of testing for American missile defense systems.</p>
<p>In about 1993, one Marshall Islander traveled to Springdale, got a job at Tyson&rsquo;s and informed his relatives that it was a good place to live. A few Marshall Islanders followed him in the mid-1990s, and then in the late 1990s the number of people heading to Springdale leaped significantly. Main reasons at the beginning: jobs are plentiful and cost of living is low relative to places like Hawaii where it costs $2,500 a month to rent a 2-bedroom apartment. Now, there is such a large group of Marshallese there that virtually everyone in the Marshall Islands  (population approx. 53,000) has relatives in Springdale, making it easy for people to move there with the help of their already established relatives.</p>

			<p>Hard to imagine the 5% figure as being accurate if there are 9 of them in that small a section of their group. And if those 9 were working at the Tyson plant exactly how many of the rest of us have already been exposed at our dinner table?</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just opened the borders and said, &lsquo;Come on in! Bring your diseases! Bring &lsquo;em!&rsquo; Why are we doing that? Those who have it need to be quarantined and treated, or sent back to their country.?</p>
<p>Blame our corrupt Congressmen and Senators. They get those hefty campaign contributions (whaddaya mean ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTIONS), from the corporations buying the &#8220;honorable&#8221; senators and representativdes. Not only the large corporate entities, but even small businesses, have the same rule of thumb, which can be stated as: NEVER HIRE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN FOR THE JOB AS LONG AS YOU CAN INSTEAD HIRE CHEAP IMMIGRANT LABOR!</p>
<p>Our infamous &#8220;friend&#8221; styling himself as Williams, the Plumber told us that himself   &mdash;   during a momentary fit of honesty. But fear not&hellip; LEPROSY and many other ugly little diseases and parasites also come from the Mexican side of the border. Like that &#8220;BRAINWORM&#8221;, for example. Now would any of you good readers care to dine with me at McVomit, Burger Barf, or Slop-in-the-Box. All the fast food franches are notorious for hiring {illegal] immigrant labor. (Keeps labor costs down, you know. Ensuring a fatter profit for the franchise owner.) Of course these good businessmen and entrepreneurs would NEVER knowingly hire illegals. So they&rsquo;ll check the proffered documents in a dark room, without really looking at them, and brush Senora Garza&rsquo;s lack of English as being the fault of our poor public school system.</p>
<p>Also try not to look at, much less THINK about what you might be ingesting. Immigrants, legal OR illegal, are not reputed to be particularly fastidious about personal cleanliness or hygiene matters, either. Washing your hands after coming out of the stall? Let the Americans waste time washing up afterwards!</p>
<p>Check out those great essays by FROSTY WOOLDRIDGE at his frostywooldridge.com website. He tells the truth about those little &#8220;gifts&#8221; immigrants share with us so freely and willingly.</p>

I&rsquo;ve noticed those signs on the wall in the rest rooms of California restaurants: EMPLOYEES MUST WASH THEIR HANDS!  </p>
<p>But it strikes me that   &mdash;   <br>
   #1.  many of the employees don&rsquo;t seem to understand English (much less read it), and&hellip;<br>
   #2.  no one is standing there to make sure they really do wash.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only ones who bother to comply with the signs are Americanos (as usual).</p>

			<p>A few years ago I stopped in a McDonalds on the outskirts of Indianapolis and started taking pictures of the exclusively Mexican kitchen crew workers.  The two white managers freaked and told me I couldn&rsquo;t take pictures and I told them I was with the Immigration Department and I would take pictures anywhere I damned well pleased.  I lied, but it was worth it to see the fear in all their faces&hellip;    </p>
