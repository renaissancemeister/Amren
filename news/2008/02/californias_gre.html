						<p>Voters in her new home state of California have rejected former Georgia congresswoman Cynthia McKinney in her bid for the presidency on the Green Party ticket. They voted instead &mdash; by a margin of more than 2 to 1 &mdash; for Ralph Nader in Tuesday&rsquo;s presidential primary.</p>
<p>McKinney won Green Party primaries in Arkansas and Illinois and is in slightly trailing Nader in Massachusetts, according to the Green Party. The party reported there were voting irregularities Illinois, where some voters reported there were no Green Party ballots at some locations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McKinney, 52, served six terms as a Georgia congresswoman before losing her seat to Hank Johnson in 2006. She moved to the San Francisco area last spring to attend graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p>According to Ballot Access News, with 96 percent of precincts reporting, Nader had 16,835 votes in California; McKinney had 7,124. Another Green Party candidate from Georgia, who has withdrawn from the race, former Black Panther Party leader Elaine Brown, of Brunswick, received 1,259 votes in California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McKinney has vowed to campaign in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., where she will be on the Feb. 12 primary ballot. Green Party candidates are on 21 state ballots. The party holds its nominating convention in Chicago, July 10-13.</p>

			<p>As an indication of just how goofy and racist McKinney and her kind are perceived was shown in the precinct in which I served as election judge this past Tuesday.</p>
<p>We had a 40% turnout which is decent for a primary.  Of the 347 people who took ballots, 6 asked for a non-partisan one, 180 selected a GOP ballot, and 161 chose a Democrat ballot.</p>
<p>No one but no one requested a Green Party ballot that would&rsquo;ve delivered a vote for McKinney whose name was at the very top of the page.</p>
<p>In one sense, a lot of taxpayers&rsquo; money was wasted by the county having to supply us with 800 sheets of visual optic-sensitive paper for which voters of our suburb had no use.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s reassuring to know that the wise White burghers of our community have Miss McKinney totally figured out!</p>

<p>Yes, they wanted someone with at least half-a-brain without a racist attitude that doesn&rsquo;t live in a special corner of hell, where racists and mal-contents dwell. </p>

			<p>I cant think of a better way to waste your vote than to support the &#8216;green party&rsquo;. Of course no green party supporter will own up to the fact that their protest vote in 00 put Bush in the white house as 90,000 nader votes were received in Florida&hellip;.maybe the green party can provide the needed diversion to keep the democrats out of the white house in 08&hellip;</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Well now, give her some slack. She&rsquo;s not all bad. She&rsquo;s not my candidate, but I refuse to condemn her, because she&rsquo;s got at least one thing figured out   &mdash;   which most of the other parties, and the candidates and voters (whites too!) haven&rsquo;t. After all, it takes at least some brains to do a little thinking for yourself and get two plus two figured out. For that reason, she&rsquo;s alienated one very rich and powerful &#8220;white&#8221; element which is determined to have her scalp. No wonder she&rsquo;s received terrible coverage from the controlled media and she&rsquo;s portrayed (by them) as a half-wit and a racist! That&rsquo;s to be expected for ANYONE who challenges the entrenched power structure.  Any of the other candidates would be blasted too - if they dared to be half as honest, independent, and outspoken as she&rsquo;s been. So I say, good for her! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not bad-mouthing her - although I&rsquo;m not voting for her either.</p>

<p>With McCain as the front runner for the Republicans, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me who gets elected now.  I&rsquo;ve figured out that both parties are working for the same side and the election has been rigged ensure the status quo remains.<br>

			<p>McKinney is a black racist Georgian.  Californians are smart enough to not fall for her thinly veiled racist attitudes.  I&rsquo;m beginning to respect the California voter.  They reject black racism even though they  embrace liberalism - quite unique.  I also saw how they rejected Obama and voted for Hillary.  Obviously the Latino voter sees Obama as a black man and understand they can&rsquo;t support black man while the Latino / black war is going on in LA and other places out there.</p>

<p>This is a feather in their cap?</p>

<p>Since they&rsquo;re a collection of die-hard Marxists, a more accurate name would be the &#8220;Watermelon Party&#8221; (green on the outside, red on the inside). The Europeans have been calling them that since the 1980s.</p>
