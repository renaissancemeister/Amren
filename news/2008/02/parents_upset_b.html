						<p>During a Black History Month celebration at Carvers Bay High School, the Rev. Kylon Middleton spent about 20 minutes talking about the accomplishments of the black community and encouraging all students, regardless of race, to succeed despite adversity.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the five minutes of his speech when he mentioned &#8220;black power&#8221; and said &#8220;black is beautiful&#8221; that has a handful of white parents upset.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Parents phoned the district late Thursday with complaints that their children had felt uncomfortable during the schoolwide assembly, when students raised their fists in the air and chanted &#8220;black is back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not a matter of trying to stir up an insurrection,&#8221; [Middleton] said. &#8220;This was a Black History Month speech. The whole thing was tailored around the occasion. That is a part of black history. Highlighting achievements of black power, that doesn&rsquo;t negate anybody&rsquo;s culture. It&rsquo;s not a bad thing to celebrate being black.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his speech, Middleton used the words &#8220;black power&#8221; in relation to an image that was on the &#8220;pick&#8221; or comb he used to tame his afro when he was younger. He told students during Thursday&rsquo;s assembly there was a black fist on it that was a symbol of black power.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black people need to know they can be proud of their own heritage. You don&rsquo;t have to negate your blackness or African-American heritage in order to assimilate to a majority culture. They need to hear that message, because they are marginalized,&#8221; Middleton said on Friday. &#8220;Race matters in America. We&rsquo;re told everyone has equal rights and opportunities, but that&rsquo;s hogwash. Black people have to work extra hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Middleton said he made it a point during his speech to make sure that the white students wouldn&rsquo;t mistake his message of black pride for anti-white.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a good time to be a black person in America,&#8221; he said, in reference to Illinois Sen. Barack Obama&rsquo;s bid for president. &#8220;This does not negate any other heritage, be it Anglo or Saxon. This does not negate any other heritage, be it Judeo or Christian. This does not negate you if you are from German descent or rather Italian descent or Spanish descent. This does not negate you but then let me tell you, don&rsquo;t hate on us because we&rsquo;re glad to be black.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t see anything inappropriate with his speech,&#8221; Dozier said [Georgetown County School Superintendent Randy Dozier]. &#8220;People may have gotten excited. I think some people were uncomfortable by kids&rsquo; reaction to things. I guess I was just kind of surprised we had any issues of this nature. I think it was probably misinterpreted.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Did anyone see what Obama&rsquo;s wife said a few days ago?</p>
<p>She said for the first time in her adult life (44 years) she was proud of her country.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see: she is proud of her country because they agree with her.</p>
<p>Imagine, living her whole life in a country that she wasn&rsquo;t proud of, but still not wanting to leave it.</p>

<p>Discretion is not high on the list of black traits; they often just don&rsquo;t have the restraint necessary to play it cool in white societies.  See, the whole <span class="caps">BHM </span>thing is predicated on the idea that &#8220;the otha 11 munfs is white histry munfs.&#8221;  That sort of just-so thinking is shot all to hell when a professional black (<b>not</b> a black professional) speaker states &#8220;black is beautiful&#8221; and &#8220;black power,&#8221; and blacks chant &#8220;black is back.&#8221;  See, even the dimmest white notices that nowhere do whites say similar things during &#8220;their 11 munfs.&#8221;  Cognitive dissonance ensues&hellip;</p>
<p>Killing the golden goose - the inevitable result of the race-replacement killing the west.</p>

<p>Black is back?  You mean they were gone?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s encouraging to see blacks behaving like this.  First, it affirms that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with pride in one&rsquo;s race.  Secondly, such conduct only puts young whites on notice that a blacks are separate and distinct people who put their own interests first.  </p>
<p>Many white teens walking out of this assembly will come to realize that whites must look out for themselves.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll stop &#8220;hating on you&#8221; for being glad to be black when you stop &#8220;hating on me&#8221; for being glad to be white.  Once again, America&rsquo;s overt racial double-standard is proudly on display.  Can you imagine what the outcry from black parents would be if a school speaker told white students to chant &#8220;white power&#8221; or for that matter, even acknowledged the accomplishments of white Americans?<br>

					<p>Screw you Dozier, you lying <span class="caps">POS. </span> What is to misinterpret about leading kids in chanting &#8220;Black Power&#8221; while giving the black fist salute?   This directly recalls the 1960s black revolutionaries with their kidnappings, robberies, and exhortions to &#8220;burn baby burn&#8221;. </p>
<p>Imagine the roles reversed and Jared Taylor came to give a speech that ended with all the kids chanting &#8220;White Power, White Power, White Power&#8221;.   You think the black kids would not go absolutely <span class="caps">NUTS</span>?   <span class="caps">CNN </span>would own you. </p>
<p>You got your Black President now, all special treatment is over.  You should be fired for racial insensitivity, just like if the counter hyppothetical had taken place. </p>

Make no mistake about it &#8221; black pride&#8221; is the most virulent form of racism. It&rsquo;s all based on falsehoods.</p>

					<p>&#8220;black is back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back from where? I&rsquo;m sure I would have noticed if they&rsquo;d been gone.</p>
<p>Oh, I understand: they&rsquo;re back on the world stage, ready to dazzle us with their cultural achievements and pull us out of the dark ages we&rsquo;ve been languishing in since the white man destroyed the Golden Age of African culture and invention.</p>
<p>No, unfortunately, they are indeed back, and ready to make their atrocities towards whites during the Reconstruction period in the South after the Civil War look like blacks and whites enjoying a picnic together.</p>

					<p>Good Lord. All I can say is that there would <strong>really</strong> be an outcry had the entire situation been reversed. And I&rsquo;m afraid that no matter how much they chant &#8220;Black Power&#8221;, their history and culture pale in comparison to Western Civilization. They are what they are, and no amount of excited chanting can elevate them. </p>

					<p>Rev. Kylong Middleton is an idiot.  All of his references to &#8220;Black Power&#8221;, raises memories of a time of riots and racial unrest in America.  Black Power was a hostile political separatist movement that arose in the 1960&rsquo;s. One of its leaders was Malcom X, who supplied the rhetoric, style and attitude against complete integration into the general American population. It was initially called &#8220;The Black Party for Self Defense&#8221; with mottos such as &#8220;Free your mind and your ass will follow&#8221; and &#8220;Say it loud, I&rsquo;m Black and I&rsquo;m proud.&#8221;  One main point of the Black Power Concept was the necessity for Black people to define and change the world on their own terms. This included a call for revolutionary political struggle.  As the Black Power Concept began to grow, it also began to build resistance and condemnation from whites and from several African American organizations including the <span class="caps">NAACP </span>because of the anti-white message associated with Black Power. It was thought of as a separatist and anti-white movement which eventually brought its destruction in the early 70s.  What is Rev. Middleton trying to do?</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it was probably misinterpreted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And <span class="caps">HOW </span>exactly was this supposed to be interpreted? There&rsquo;s a separate set of rules for the races, and blacks are merely defended by apologists as if they&rsquo;re unknowing, callow children with no personal or moral responsibility.</p>

<p>Ain&rsquo;t no question.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what WE want &hellip; for them to feel that way?</p>
<p>Now, if Whites will defend and praise our race &hellip; if Whites will brave the censorship and the fallout from the mostly-White elites &hellip;  it will take special people &hellip; but we are eagerly awaiting their appearance.</p>

<p>Seriously, the definition of &#8216;blackness or African-American&rsquo; heritage is a moving target, constantly changing, but the purpose of this &#8216;heritage&rsquo; has always been a constant - and that is to keep black people believing that they are a special, different people - and equal to everyone else, just more equal than white people.  </p>

					<p>&#8220;Parents phoned the district late Thursday with complaints that their children had felt uncomfortable during the schoolwide assembly, when students raised their fists in the air and chanted &#8216;black is back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not a matter of trying to stir up an insurrection, [Middleton] said. &ldquo;This was a Black History Month speech. The whole thing was tailored around the occasion. That is a part of black history. Highlighting achievements of black power, that doesn&rsquo;t negate anybody&rsquo;s culture. It&rsquo;s not a bad thing to celebrate being black.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Ok, lets reverse the races. During white history month, a white &#8220;reverend&#8221; gives a talk at a school with black students present and speaks of white power, white being beautiful, etc. White kids listening raise their fists and chanting &#8220;white power&#8221;. </p>
<p>Ok, Mr Middleton ans Superintendent Dozier, is all still well? Will you still say &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anything inappropriate with his speech,&rdquo; and no one is &#8220;trying to stir up an insurrection&#8221;? Somehow I dont think so.<br>

					<p>&#8220;don&rsquo;t hate on us because we&rsquo;re glad to be black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t &#8216;hate on you&rsquo; because you&rsquo;re glad to be black.  We &#8216;hate on you&rsquo; because of the rate at which you rape, rob, murder, attack and gang assault us. Oh and did I mention trash and terrorize our neighborhoods and schools? With it evident all around us and the great &#8216;reverand&rsquo; making excuses, no wonder blacks are at the bottom of society.</p>
<p>My husband and I just returned from a trip to South America. I had a person ask me how I would know I was in a bad neighborhood in the States.  I said to pretty much look for one thing- black. This lead to another conversation with a few of the locals who have visited the States and were blown away by the hatred and racism of the blacks. They said one thing about blacks before anything else- that they&rsquo;re very racist.  My husband and I actually had to chuckle that even tourists spending but a few weeks here and speaking very little English leave with a serious discontempt for the blacks.  </p>
<p>I love it how blacks always play the &#8216;hater&rsquo; card.  Their movies cry rubbish about &#8216;brining hatred out in people they didn&rsquo;t even know about&rsquo;&hellip;etc.  Well it must be a world-wide phenomenon against the black race then, and not simply due to atrocious black behavior. </p>
<p>The race card, the &#8216;hater&rsquo; card and the excuse card = the three great formulas for continued black failure.</p>

					<p>This story exemplifies something important about &#8220;civil rights&#8221;.  It was never about being equal but only about black supremely.  The problem is, blacks are unfit to rule over anyone (even themselves).  One has only to look at Zimbabwe and South Africa to see the future if black supremacy is allowed to go unchecked.  The decline of the country followed by genocide against whites.  Ultimately, all the hallmarks of civilization vanish.</p>

<p>And well it should.  There&rsquo;s no doubt it was a racist attempt to excite those easily led and easily excitable primitives to anti-white hatred.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t get ahead because of lack of ability/intelligence, and that simple fact embarasses high profile blacks to no end.  Hoping to deflect the negative image in people&rsquo;s mind about black incompetence they are forced to decry unendingly that black failure is a direct result of white attitudes and actions.  All racist of course.</p>
<p>Adding to those lies as this instigator has done, only makes the black masses more hostile, which translates to more attacks on whites.  White parents realize this all too well.</p>
<p>But the unintended consequence to this black criminal&rsquo;s incitement to action will mean more blacks are going to wind up in the slammer, and like Jesse and Al&rsquo;s instigations it will serve only to keep them down even further for a longer period of time.</p>

When they get excited in a group   &mdash;   a sporting event, riot, mugging or rape   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s like a shark&rsquo;s feeding frenzy.  I&rsquo;m sure these white kids must&rsquo;ve felt like they were blood in the water when the speaking black got the rest of them whipped up.  </p>
<p>If possible, those parents should try to pull their kids from that school and keep them far away from <span class="caps">ANY </span>blacks.  It&rsquo;s the only thing they can do to maintain the children&rsquo;s safety.</p>

					<p>Every time I see the title &#8216;reverend&rsquo; in reference to a black speaker there is no doubt in my mind that the racism will spill out of him like lava out of mount vesuvius. It is simply incredulous that any school would allow these race biased individuals to even enter their doors. If a white &#8216;reverend&rsquo; came into a school and spilled this same type of rhetoric he would immediately be labeled a racist and vilified in the most egregious manner. Blacks are always excused for this near inciting to riot behavior. It&rsquo;s way past time to put a stop  to it. </p>

speech extolling our Culture and achievments? And does he or the<br><br>
Blacks in the audience really have nothing against Whites? That&rsquo;s<br><br>
not what the rest of the speech implied. The Black Panters used<br><br>

<p>In a way, these ethnocentric displays are a good thing, because every time they happen, they likely wake up a few more deracinated whites.  Problem is, whites in the south already know the score.

<p><br>
All whites in America, even the black worshipping white self haters, should learn about what the Union and Loyal Leauges did to whites in the South during Reconstruction.  These were secret societies encouraged by low whites who shilled for the Radical Republican party and were encouraged to intimidate whites and burn barns, etc.  The met in secret locations, were given guns, knives and matches, and held strange ceremonies which probably resembled voodoo of the day or your typical shouting &#8220;gospel&#8221; service of today.</p>
<p>The whites who organized to defend against these atrocities are now known to be the most infamous white organization in history.</p>
<p>Whites defending themselves against black violence will always be called Racists. You whites are supposed to just suffer, because they deserve to punish you.  If you say no to Reparations Now, you are a racist and will be treated like a hate criminal.</p>
<p>Robbery, Rape, Murder.  Those are our historical inheritance from our white ancestors who sat on the 1954 Supreme Court and signed the bill in White House in 1965.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thugreport.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thugreport.com/</a></p>

<p> One thing about Middleton&rsquo;s presentation, as described in the article, was appropriate, however. That was the part about the &#8220;black fist.&#8221; That&rsquo;s one of the few things blacks are good at   &mdash;   beating up people, preferably Whites or Asians, and preferably with five or six to one odds in the blacks&rsquo; favor. </p>

					<p>No one, no one voiced any concerns at all, until the assembly chanted &#8216;Black power&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s the real problem.  <br>

					<p>All the negative posts about the Africans among us mean nothing.  What would mean something is for whites to &#8220;be back&#8221;, &#8220;to have pride in <span class="caps">OUR </span>heritage&#8221; and not apologize for being the great race that built this country.</p>

					<p>We once had a speaker come to our school who said &#8220;white power&#8221;&hellip;  The principal had an assembly a day later to denounce the man, <span class="caps">AND </span>the incident was all over the newspapers (we live in the suburbs, and it even got on the front page in the big city).  In any case, the guy went to Canada and was arrested for hate speech.  He is going to be out in 4-5 years.</p>

					<p><i>If blacks are so proud to be black, then <span class="caps">WHY </span>do they have to advertise it?</i></p>
<p>Because of the genetic propensity to feel high self-esteem, Blacks have the unique ability to feel proud of what would make other races feel ashamed.</p>

					<p><i>But of course the issue with us is why can&rsquo;t we have racial chants?, why can&rsquo;t we speak of White power?,</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of the assumption by both Blacks and Whites alike that Whites are actually superior - and its celebration is, minimally, not very nice - and at its worse, very dangerous.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anything inappropriate with his speech,&rdquo; Dozier said [Georgetown County School Superintendent Randy Dozier]. &ldquo;People may have gotten excited. I think some people were uncomfortable by kids&rsquo; reaction to things. I guess I was just kind of surprised we had any issues of this nature. I think it was probably misinterpreted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So&hellip;if the story would have read:</p>
<p>During a <span class="caps">WHITE ACHIEVEMENT</span> Month celebration&hellip; &ldquo;white power&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;white is right&rdquo; that has a handful of black parents upset&hellip;children had felt uncomfortable when students raised their fists in the air and chanted &ldquo;white is right.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Would <span class="caps">THAT </span>have been &#8220;misinterpreted&#8221;?</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;It was not a matter of trying to stir up an insurrection&hellip;part of white accomplisments&hellip;highlighting achievements of white power&hellip;it&rsquo;s not a bad thing to celebrate being white.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Would <span class="caps">THAT </span>have been &#8220;misinterpreted&#8221;?</p>
<p>A <span class="caps">WHITE </span>fist&hellip;a symbol of <span class="caps">WHITE </span>power&hellip;</p>
<p>Would <span class="caps">THAT </span>have been &#8220;misinterpreted&#8221;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;WHITE people need to know they can be proud of their own heritage. You don&rsquo;t have to negate your <span class="caps">WHITENESS </span>or <span class="caps">AMERICAN HERITAGE&hellip;</span>a majority culture. They need to hear that &ldquo;Race matters in America. We&rsquo;re told everyone has equal rights and opportunities, but that&rsquo;s hogwash&hellip;due to affirmative action,diversity and multi-culturism <span class="caps">WHITE </span>people have to work extra hard.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Would <span class="caps">THAT </span>have been &#8220;misinterpreted&#8221;?</p>
<p>Middleton said he made it a point during his speech to make sure that the black students wouldn&rsquo;t mistake his message of white pride for anti-black&hellip;</p>
<p>Would <span class="caps">THAT </span>have been &#8220;misinterpreted&#8221;?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hate on us because we&rsquo;re glad to be white.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Would <span class="caps">THAT </span>have been &#8220;misinterpreted&#8221;?</p>

					<p>&#8220;Black people have to work extra hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guess this refers to things like blacks-only scholarships for which whites and Asians may not apply, schools for which whites and Asians are rejected even though they have much higher <span class="caps">SAT </span>scores than blacks admitted, black-only organizations and internships to which whites and Asians are excluded, jobs and promotions denied whites and Asians because they are reserved for blacks, rejected contracts even though white and Asian firms had a lower bids than a &#8220;black&#8221; firm, &hellip;<br>
And now we have Obama who is where he is <span class="caps">ONLY </span>because he is black, as openly admitted by those voting for him, even though he has no experience, is rated the <span class="caps">MOST </span>leftwing [fringe] Senator, belongs to a black racist church and has a long close association with his black racist minister, and has been involved in questionable real estate deals. Given a pass all because he&rsquo;s black. <br><br>
Where exactly do blacks have to &#8220;work harder&#8221;?<br><br>
The reality is that <span class="caps">NON</span>-blacks have to &#8220;work ten times harder&#8221; for the same any black achieves.</p>

					<p>A response to:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anything inappropriate with his speech,<br>
I think it was probably misinterpreted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s a minority, <span class="caps">THEN </span>it&rsquo;s hate speech</p>
<p>Posted by at 5:57 PM on February 19</p>
<p>In this instance and in this school, whites are the minority.  So, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned it should be right up there with a hate crime.  Based on the comments of many, we all seem to understand that if the situation was reversed it would be all over <span class="caps">CNN. </span> The district doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a problem with it. Well maybe their scope of acceptance is skewed.  The best way for them to determine if this was acceptable is to completely reverse the scenario. If they can&rsquo;t imagine that, then they do need to bring in a speaker that would give the white students a chance to be &#8220;lifted up&#8221; and encouraged to ignore other humans that are not the same as them, to be proud of all that the &#8220;white man&#8221; has accomplished throughout history.  The reason they can&rsquo;t imagine such a scenario is because it would never be allowed to happen.  Since this was a case of a minority race being &#8220;put down&#8221; and threatened in a school.  Where is the group of whites that should descend on the town and stand up with these parents and these students that such ignorance and intolerance <span class="caps">WILL NOT</span> BE <span class="caps">ACCECPTED</span>!  Until we stand together and form a unified voice, just as they have, we will continue to see such examples of reverse racism.  And I guarantee if nothing is done it will only get worse.  </p>
