						<p>MIGRANTS from non-English-speaking countries are far less likely to do volunteer work than people born in Australia.</p>
<p>And Australian-born residents of multicultural suburbs are less likely to be volunteers than those living in less ethnically diverse regions.</p>
<p>Sociologist Ernest Healy has crunched 2006 census data on volunteering, a well-recognised marker of social cohesion, and fears his findings reveal those living in multicultural areas, whether born overseas or not, may be quietly withdrawing from their communities.</p>
<p>His study, to be published in Monash University&rsquo;s Centre for Population and Urban Research&rsquo;s journal People and Place this week, finds 18.8 per cent of those adults born in Australia engaged in volunteer work within the past 12 months compared with 10.4 per cent for migrants from non-English speaking countries.</p>
<p>However, migrants from Britain, the US, South Africa and New Zealand recorded similar results to those born in Australia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The research shows increased ethnic diversity is likely to be related to social withdrawal, with those living in highly diverse ethnic settings tending to be less engaged in the types of community involvement mediated through organisations and social groups,&#8221; Dr Healy told The Australian.</p>
<p>He said that at a time when there was a push for greater numbers of immigrants to help redress the skills shortage, state and federal governments tended to the simplistic view that social cohesion in a more multicultural society would &#8220;look after itself&#8221;. &#8220;The idealistic notion that multiculturalism is a source of cultural enrichment for Australian society really needs to be moderated a little and have a greater element of realism.</p>
<p>&#8220;This naive view of multiculturalism among some policy-makers has led us to believe that immigration programs creating diverse communities will allow a kind of social tolerance to emerge spontaneously. Rather, we have to start being proactive to facilitate a sense of community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using suburban Melbourne as a template, Dr Healy found the length of time a migrant of non-English-speaking background had lived in Australia made little difference to the low levels of volunteering, meaning cultural factors in their country of origin might be at play.</p>
<p>His paper Ethnic Diversity and Social Cohesion in Melbourne found while there was a correlation between higher incomes and greater levels of volunteering for all people living in Australia, the significant gap between richer Australian-born and richer migrants from non-English-speaking countries remained.</p>
<p>Of those who earned $2000 a week or more, 27.5 per cent of those born in Australia had done volunteer work in the past year, compared with 19.1 per cent of migrants from non-English-speaking countries.</p>
<p>Dr Healy said a key finding was that Australian-born people were less likely to volunteer if they were living in areas of high ethnic diversity. He said a lack of proficiency in English might play some role in the findings, but it failed to account for why migrants from non-English-speaking countries were not volunteering even within their own ethnic groupings.</p>
<p>Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia chair Vula Messimeri disputed that migrants were disengaged from their own communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the voluntary work they do is to set up support networks in their own &hellip; communities,&#8221; she said. If you&rsquo;re coming to Australia as a refugee or a migrant with little money, your first endeavours will be trying to get employment, a roof over your head and education for your children. After that they slowly start building connections into their community.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Here is the core of the problem facing the world; It has long been a Western cultural value to help others less fortunate than oneself.  It is a part of higher chivalry and nobility at its best.  But this is not part of non-Western cultures, which are all about taking and cultural centrism.  (I include the indigenous Americans who have acquired the misnomer &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; and &#8220;Latino.&#8221;)  As the &#8220;enlightened&#8221; Westerners fulfill what they see as their humanistic duty, they are missing their own foundation wearing away - simply because they have arrogantly thought it was permanent and impervious.</p>

			<p>Observing any volunteer function one will notice that they are always entirely white.  The beneficiaries of the volunteer work seem to be predominantly black.</p>

			<p>Same in America. 3rd worlders have no concept of charity unless it goes to them and their own! I blame the Catholic and Christian Churches for dumbing down the whole White race! Their revised Gospel is nothing but a death sentence to Whites the world over. Christians don&rsquo;t even know the difference of WHO they are suppose to forgive and WHO their brethern are, because the Church infiltrators, have led them to believe it is the unwashed masses of the world&hellip;.No, it isn&rsquo;t. Wake UP!</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t believe that they are going to do any volunteer work for the greater community.  It won&rsquo;t happen. Hispanics in California have not created any hospitals, any museums, any boy scout councils, nothing. They live off the dominant society and wait for things to be done for them.  It is their culture.  Even their commuity activists are only doing the job because white folks give them free money.  La Raza Unida, for example, gets free Federal and State funding (read: &#8220;white people&#8221;).  Maldef and MeCha also get feeral and state funds.  And they use that money to lobby for amnesty, organize demonstrations, and get free affirmative action education for their kids. </p>
<p>So white people create and fund organizations for them and for everyone, and they (at best)create race-based or religion-based organizations for themselves alone.</p>

			<p><i>And Australian-born residents of multicultural suburbs are less likely to be volunteers than those living in less ethnically diverse regions.</i></p>
<p>And leftists are more likely to live in those multicultural neighborhoods, meaning leftists are less likely to do volunteer work, except that of the paid, Ford Foundation-supported kind.</p>
<p>This tracks with my own personal decisions, too. I no longer give to charities because I&rsquo;ve found they&rsquo;re very likely to use my money supporting multiculutralist causes. I have also lost all sense of idealism (including desire for military service) as America has turned from a nation into a Middle Eastern bazaar where it&rsquo;s every man for himself.</p>

			<p>I live in a so-called diverse area of Sydney and I hate it. It&rsquo;s like living in a foreign country. Just like Alan (9.41PM), I have also stopped giving to charities.</p>
<p>What I have noticed is that charities like World Vision set up their displays of childrens pictures and their hard luck stories, and I see that they target whites as they walk past their displays.</p>
<p>On one occassion, I stopped and spoke with the young woman manning the display, and her first call was to ask me to donate $39 per month to help some kid in Africa. I told her I would only do that if her organisation started hunting down the dictators of these African countries and started to recover the monies that these thugs steal from their own people and stashing the funds in Swiss bank accounts.</p>
<p>She then said that they have kids in Indonesia who needed help. I told her that as these kids live in a muslim country, so those islamic countries rich with petro-dollars should be responsible for looking after poor muslim kids, not white Christians. I asked her why she never stops their scarfed and veiled women that walked past her display, and she couldn&rsquo;t/wouldn&rsquo;t answer. I told her that the reason was because these people, along with other ethnic peoples simply don&rsquo;t give to charities like whites do, and she then agreed.</p>
<p>I told her to start getting money from the lucky blacks who came here from Africa as refugees, and suggest to them that they give a small portion of the money they receive from tax payers to help Africans in Africa. Of course, she knew the answer to that&hellip;.blacks simply don&rsquo;t give like whites.</p>
<p>I do a little volunteer work and I chose to do this with the Vietnam Vets, simply because I didn&rsquo;t want to be helping in any way any foreigners. I will only help white Australians.</p>

			<p>Its the same here in Buffalo. As blacks move into the suburbs the ranks of the volunteer fire fighters are depleting. Some of these fire departments will fold up and no one will be available for first aid help. </p>

			<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more strongly.  In fact there was a book published by a Harvard professor, I believe his name was Putnam and the title is something like &#8220;Bowling Alone,&#8221; he made the same argument.  I&rsquo;m &#8220;blessed&#8221; to live in diverse New York.  There&rsquo;s no sense of community at all in diverse areas, everyone is tense and suspicious of one another.  My liberal minded colleagues proclaim the virtues of diversity, yet every single one lives in white areas, they usually explain that it&rsquo;s because of &#8220;socioeconomics&#8221; or for &#8220;school districts.&#8221;  I remember volunteering during 9/11 and before that at a hospital and virtually all the volunteers were white.  This in a city with a minority population of 50%.  The only minorities present were those forced to volunteer by their high schools.  Now, I have no desire to volunteer in New York.  Why should I help some ungrateful minority who doesn&rsquo;t appreciate it and blames whites for all their problems anyway.  Minorities volunteer all right, but ONLY in organizations that help other minority brethren, God forbid to pitch in for the greater good.  When was the last time someone heard a minority be concerned with the environment or global warming or women&rsquo;s rights abroad, these are exclusively issues whites discuss. I would consider donating money to help poor children in Russia or even here in Appalachia.  Another story that comes to mind was when I was in college.  They forced a group of us to travel down south with Habitat for Humanity to build homes, primarily for Hispanics.  Out of a group of 70 volunteers, only one was Hispanic, the rest were whites and some fools from Bush&rsquo;s moronic Americorps.  Hispanics (the actual ones who would be living in these homes) were encouraged to volunteer, only one did.  I was shocked, it blows my mind to this day.  These minorities are like spoiled teenagers, you give them a toyota and they&rsquo;ll cry for a bentley, they will be never satisfied, it isn&rsquo;t worth it.</p>

			<p>Remember that Robert Heinlein-based movie: &#8220;Starship Troopers?&#8221;</p>
<p>In it were repeated public announcements that &#8220;Service is Citizenship&#8221; in reference to serving in the military.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Black-orient media could be called upon to &#8220;volunteer&#8221; their services for these announcements, but in reference to VOLUNTARY &#8220;service.&#8221;</p>
<p>And maybe they could do the same for anti-littering ads.</p>

<p>You ask about blood donors. How about organ donors? I have heard blacks do not want to donate their organs because they believe they will go to white people after their death.</p>
<p>Think about that. Even if that was true blacks would rather do nothing than help white people. </p>

			<p>I think the Japanese and Koreans are exceptions. Atleast in Japan, the Japanese volunteer a lot. Muslims volunteer only if the benefactors are Muslims.</p>

			<p>The difference between Whites and the all other races is no more evident than in charity and volunteerism. The majority of Whites work to make the world around them a better place; the majority of non-Whites are simply out for themselves and don&rsquo;t seem to care if everything around them falls to pieces. </p>
<p>The non-White races are less evolved emotionally. Blacks especially seem to be stuck in a perpetual twilight of arrested development; most of them are like narcissistic 12 year olds.<br>
 <br>
I would tell any White person doing charity work on the behalf of non-Whites to stop wasting their time, because no matter what you do for them it will never be enough, and these creatures don&rsquo;t have a grateful bone in their bodies to begin with.</p>
<p>In high school I sometimes volunteered at a church near my school, handing out meals to the &#8216;homeless&rsquo;. Most of these people weren&rsquo;t even homeless; many of them drove up in nice cars and were well-dressed. </p>
<p>How did they show their gratitude?</p>
<p>Some of them would complain that they didn&rsquo;t want what we were serving and wanted something else!</p>
<p>Others would eat at the picnic area behind the church and leave their discarded trash all over the tables and ground, ignoring the  trash bins never more than 30 feet away from them. </p>
<p>As you might have guessed, most of these people were Black. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been soured on charity work ever since, at least in regard to non-Whites.</p>

<p> I live in a heavily racially mixed area and have donated blood many times. I very seldom see a non-White donor, and if I do it is always an Asian, never a black.</p>

			<p>For the poster who asked about racial statistics on blood donors, that reminds me &hellip; <br>
Are they not always bemoaning the fact that their is a shortage of donors in the minority community for organs, bone marrow, and the like?  Sometimes local papers will run a story on how a minority or mixed person can&rsquo;t get what they need and they end up organizing a &#8220;drive&#8221; and education campaign to get minorities to sign up to be donors.<br>
I never know if they are successful or not, because I never see a follow-up story.</p>

<p>No, but I do know that non-whites are far less likely to donate their organs in case of death, and all that requires is checking a box on your DL application.</p>

			<p>Anyone been to the Third World? Mexico? Nigeria? I have.<br>
Volunteerism is an American/Western phenomenon. It occurs in rich countries only. The attitude is completely incomprehensible in these cultures<br>
because the entire daily existence is consumed by one goal&hellip;survive. All finer things in life simply do not exist.<br>
Life is short, 50 years is old age, living beyond that is a nightmare of neglect and hopelessness. Death in childhood is common. Few adults have a job, or an education of anykind nor a secure income of any kind. What wealth that exists is<br>
grabbed by the biggest most brutal of bunch who then uses every means possible to keep himself on the top of the heap. Those who preach &#8220;diversity&#8221; of cultures think the world is a great big chocolate box of choices&hellip; they should go see what the choices are really like.<br>

			<p>The whole blood clinic came over to school once, and they set up their equipments in the gym and they accepted donations from the faculty staff and students.</p>
<p>And the reason why there aren&rsquo;t many black people for blood donor&hellip;  wouldn&rsquo;t that be because many of them are refused?  Gay people, bisexual people and HIV-positive people are refused, and people from certain African countries are refused.  When I was donating my blood, some of the questions made me burst into a laughter a few times&hellip; &#8220;Are you gay?&#8221;  &#8220;Did you have unprotected intercourse within the last six months?&#8221;  &#8220;Are you on crack?&#8221;  &#8220;Did you do cocaine within the last several weeks?&#8221;  &#8220;Did you have an intercourse with someone of the same gender within the last six months?&#8221;  and it also asked me if I paid a visit to certain countries within the last six months.  </p>
<p>And there were many white girls who wanted to donate their blood but they were refused too&hellip;.  they told me their weight did not meet the requirements.  They were too light.  That makes me wonder how many Asian girls would have been refused!! Asian girls tend to be somewhat smaller than white girls.  </p>
<p>I also read that it is very healthy for young people (who qualify) to give blood&hellip; if the same blood stays in the body for the whole time, the body does not need to create fresh blood&hellip;. if a certain amount of blood leaves our bodies, then the body creates fresh blood to make up for it&hellip; and the blood stays fresh in the bodies.  And of course, drink a plenty of water after giving blood!! the body creates the blood out of the water. </p>

			<p>I remember when living in Houston and Habitat For Humanity came to town. I drove over there to check it out and saw that probably 95% of the people that were working on the houses were White. Sitting on lawn chairs with their coolers full of &#8220;cold drinks&#8221; were the future homeowners- around 15 to 20 ghetto blacks-calmly watching AND critiquing the evil White folks that were laboring in intense heat to build them their homes. While I was there a White roofer fell of the roof and seriously hurt himself and the blacks just roared with laughter, one even said-&#8220;dat white boy don&rsquo;t know what he doin!&#8221;It was around this time that I started to slap myself because I just KNEW that I was just having a bad dream,but I soon realized it wasn&rsquo;t a bad dream and that Whites really are that stupid!!! Drove over there about 2 yrs. later [doors locked with a 357 mag. at my side] to see what those houses looked like and they were completely trashed, which wasn&rsquo;t surprizing. As always- its a wonder that I can sleep at night!!!!!</p>

<p>Do you notice that all of these blacks geting free houses from Habitat for Humanity are always nicely dressed in the latest track suits and nikes with their cell phones and manicured nails? I do. I can&rsquo;t afford to buy a home and nobody is going to give me a free one. Oh wait, I forgot, I&rsquo;m white.</p>

			<p>I had a friend who volunteered during hurricane Katrina. He said never again. He left here in Texas to go to New Orleans. He said the blacks were the most spoiled, demanding and ungrateful people he had ever seen. When getting off the bus, volunteers all white, handed them bottled water. Many demanded soda. In the shelters, they would complain about the food even though it was quite good having been donated by restaurants and churches. Once finished with their meals, they left their trash  on the table instead of throwing it into the trash cans. Very few ever said thanks. When a group of black women and children were struggling with their luggage, he politely asked a group of young black men to help him help the women and kids. Instead of helping, they cussed at him and called him  white racial slurs and told him as a volunteer that it was his job, not their. This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. Inner-city african-americans are so used to government handouts, they really feel that they are entitled to everything and don&rsquo;t have to try and help themselves. He later volunteered in the all-white areas and he said the difference was like night and day. </p>

<p>Well, normal, decent people wouldn&rsquo;t have needed that sort of help - they mostly had friends or family they could go to, or else financial resources they had earned on their own.</p>
<p>We had a case here in Utah of a guy who - after 9 months of living in an apartment with government support - was getting kicked out of his apartment because he couldn&rsquo;t/wouldn&rsquo;t pay the rent. He decided to try to burn the place down.</p>
