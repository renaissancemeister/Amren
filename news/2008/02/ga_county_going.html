						<p>Students in all of Greene County&rsquo;s regular public schools will be separated by gender starting next fall, a move educators hope will improve rock-bottom test scores and reduce teen pregnancy and discipline rates in the small, rural system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School officials say they need drastic change to save the low-performing district from slipping further behind the rest of the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Districts nationwide have been scrambling to implement single-sex education, since federal officials finalized rules to ease the process in 2006. But officials in Greene County, east of metro Atlanta along I-20, say they believe they are the first in the country to convert the entire district to a single-gender model.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Education officials did not return several request for comment. Georgia Department of Education spokesman Dana Tofig said the district does not need state approval to convert to single gender.</p>
<p>But McCollough says he&rsquo;s been advised by the district&rsquo;s attorneys that the conversion is allowable under federal law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the model approved by the school board, boys and girls in Greene County will be split into different classrooms in the district&rsquo;s two elementary schools and will attend separate middle and high schools, McCollough said.</p>
<p>The county&rsquo;s one charter school &mdash; Lake Oconee Academy &mdash; will remain coed. It is public, but has autonomy and is governed by a committee of parents and community leaders.</p>
<p>The charter school, unlike the rest of the county&rsquo;s public schools, has an enrollment zone focused on the predominantly affluent, white lakefront community south of I-20. The rest of Greene is mostly black and middle class or low income.</p>
<p>The charter school opened last fall amid protests by black citizens who said the enrollment zones created de facto segregation. Attending the charter school would not be an option for the majority of families in Greene County, who live north of the interstate.</p>
<p>McCollough hopes the single-gender model will raise test scores and improve graduation rates in a district where more than three-quarters of the 2,000 students are eligible for free or reduced lunches.</p>
<p>Just 67 percent of Greene County ninth graders go on to receive a diploma, compared to 72 percent statewide. Last year, students scored an average of 1,168 on the SAT college entrance exam, far behind the state average of 1,458 and the national average of 1,495.</p>
<p>Less than a third of the system&rsquo;s 69 graduates got the B average required for a state HOPE scholarship last year. Statewide, 38 percent of graduates qualify for a HOPE award.</p>

			<p>And how will the students learn any better?  If single-gender is such a benefit, then why not apply it to every district?  The answer is that black districts are trying every gimmick and hoping something &#8220;works.&#8221;</p>

			<p>If schools can be separated by gender why can&rsquo;t we separate by race?  Sounds like a good plan to me.  Way past due I think.</p>

It may help a bit, but that&rsquo;s not the real problem. It&rsquo;s a culture of blaming Whitey for self-inflicted problems.</p>

			<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t think that single sex education for all students regardless of race is a bad idea. Especially in the early years and into high school if necessary.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s see now   &mdash;   we&rsquo;ve tried Head Start, free tuition, free books, free tutors, money for grades, Afro-centered curriculum, Black history, Black holidays, Black pride, Eubonics, Black teachers &amp; Black administrators, after-school programs, free computers, free lunches, summer school, field trips, inspirational speakers, metal detectors, Big Brother &amp; Big Sister programs, Boot-camp schools, religious schools, integration and segregation, and still we can&rsquo;t seem to get African-American kids to learn or pass basic classes.  What could possibly be the reason?  </p>

			<p>Good luck with that. Some of the classes I teach are made up of boys only. Jerks and fools are still jerks and fools  &mdash;  with or without girls. There is still the code of honor to be the biggesst and baddest thug in the thug dump. </p>

			<p>This is actually one of the few things that is successful in raising test scores.  All students should be segregated by sex but blacks, in particular, need it in order to function at whatever potential they have.  Segregation by race also improves test scores.</p>

<p>The one solution that will work has never been tried.  Falsify the records!</p>
<p>Otherwise, hide the results and make sure nobody finds out about them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one or the other.  I would urge the leftists to consider either option, because nothing else will work.</p>

			<p>Probably a great idea for white students, however. Imagine the generation of white men we could raise without them having to deal with the tangle of racial and gender politics! A pure, healthily competitive environment; such a thing I can hardly imagine.</p>

			<p>I hope this works. Maybe the solution for blacks is to seperate them by gender. Less distractions, I guess. For whites, gender seperation is bad. White men and women need to work together, and the best place to learn is at school. For whites, co-ed classes inspire both genders to study more.</p>

			<p>Actually, falsification of records has been tried, Ranger.  The superintendent of schools here in Birmingham is in hot water for altering the report of an independent auditor.</p>

			<p>I remember that at Parkside Elementary School in Chicago that they actually gave IQ tests in the 1960s. Maybe if they started doing that again, and made the results availible to the parents in one-on-one meetings, they could explain the educational probabilities of success to them. Then maybe, just maybe, the parents would not be fooled into thinking their little children are college material. Then they could properly allocate tax payers money to things such as vocational training.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s pathetic what some school systems have to go through to try to get students to do what they&rsquo;re supposed to do.  That these students lack motivation and self-control is their own fault and their parents&rsquo; fault.  Even though many of them are failing I don&rsquo;t blame the school system.  There is a limit to what schools can do.</p>
<p>I do want to congratulate the community for setting up at least one school - the charter school - that is successful.  Or more likely it&rsquo;s students are successful because they are respectful kids who care about their own futures.</p>

<p>A-YUP!  Illiterate lazy thugs will still be illiterate lazy thugs, and blacks will still be blacks&hellip;which is pretty much the same thing.  Their culture says it ain&rsquo;t cool to be smart, work hard, study, or be disciplined.  What is cool is doing the chimp walk with your pants down below your butt, and just biding time until you can sell drugs on the street.  Takes no smarts to do that, just thuggery.<br>

			<p>Gender-separate classrooms are becoming more popular in well-to-do private schools in Georgia becuase private-school educators realize that the opportunity for learning suffers when both the boys and the girls in class are paying far more attention to the oposite sex than to the teacher.  That much is common sense. </p>
<p>That being said, this will not improve Greene County&rsquo;s &#8220;dismal&#8221; school performance one whit because the poor performance is a product of the lousy demographics in the area.  Greene County is in the heart of Georgia&rsquo;s Black Belt (originally named for the rich, black, fertile soil in the region but which has come to be associated with the ridiculously-high number of black people living there).  Greene County is around 70% black, and most White kids attend shcool privately or elsewhere.  That&rsquo;s all anybody needs to know to explain the appalling performance of the county schools.</p>
<p>Gender-separate classrooms can be effective but only if the individual students involved have the necessary intelligence to succeed.  </p>

			<p>I went to an all girls&rsquo; school and loved it.  It was so much easier to concentrate on school work without boys around.  I think single-gender education will be a great benefit to all students regardless of race.  Though I&rsquo;m not expecting miracles, I think this is a good move.</p>

			<p>Having attended  single sex religious schools many years ago, we had few distractions and the discipline was rigorous to say the least. The key factor was that we had a culture of family life where discipline and respect for authority was cultivated in us. We came to school prepared to follow the rules (for the most part) and to respect our superiors if only through fear. The old saw about coming home and complaining to your parents that you were punished in school for some infraction resulting in a follow-up punishment from your parents was usually true.</p>
<p><br>
Assuming that the kids in the above article are Afro-American, it will be challenging. In the majority of homes there IS no discipline and no parenting.  <br>
It may work well in the lower grades but usually by junior high and definitely by high school, it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

			<p>I note that Bantu parents howled about the one charter school because it is in a predominantly Caucasian area, and to them, that&rsquo;s &#8220;de facto segregation&#8221;. They have a problem with THAT, but not with the 100% black outhouses called &#8220;schools&#8221;? </p>
