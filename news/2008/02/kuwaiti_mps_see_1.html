						<p>Two Islamist MPs on Sunday called on the Kuwaiti government to ban Valentine&rsquo;s Day celebrations, saying they flout Islamic values and promote immorality. &ldquo;We call on the commerce minister to perform his duties by banning celebrations of Valentine&rsquo;s Day which is alien to our society .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and contradicts our religion&rsquo;s values and teachings,&rdquo; MP Jamaan al-Harbash told reporters. He said that Valentine&rsquo;s Day, marked on February 14, spreads &ldquo;immorality&rdquo; in society and warned concerned authorities that he will take action against them if they do not ban it. MP Waleed al-Tabtabai, who heads a parliamentary committee for monitoring alien practices, said the panel will on Wednesday meet with officials from the ministries of information, interior and commerce to study measures required to curb the celebrations. He said they will review restrictions needed to prevent such celebrations from spreading &ldquo;moral corruption&rdquo; among youth in Kuwait.<br>

			<p>Hindus are also very hostile to Valentine&rsquo;s Day. I read that a mob burned down any shop that sold any item related to Valentine&rsquo;s Day. I guess the Idea that women are to be considered anything more than chattel is alien to the non-Indo-European mind.</p>

			<p>Over the last several centuries <i>Western</i> culture has evolved to a norm of marriage by elective affinity. Valentine&rsquo;s Day is a symbol thereof. A culture wherein marriage is <i>arranged</i> for familial strategising, would find ancillary customs to the Western norm alien, as we in the West by and large reject arranged marriage and the ancillary norms of any variant of that custom. In Western culture, it is <b><i>Romantic</i></b> love that causes marriage. In cultures holding to any variant of arranged marriage, love is supposed to come after marriage and as a result of marriage; and even the <i>idea</i> of &#8220;Romantic&#8221; love is suspicionable. </p>

<p>Right. Love has no place in Islamic society. How about an alternative holiday celebrating a distinctly muslim approach to relationships. It&rsquo;s going to be called &#8220;marry your cousin and have sex with her against her will&#8221; day</p>

			<p>Once again, people, it&rsquo;s not &#8220;Valentine&rsquo;s Day&#8221;, but &#8220;<i>Saint</i> Valentine&rsquo;s Day&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s supposed to honor a Christian martyr who developed an innovative way to spread love from his prison cell.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s the antithesis of Islam.  No wonder they want to ban it!</p>

			<p>I didn&rsquo;t see anything, in the article, against love.  Only against an alien practice imported by the most powerful country in the world as part of a &#8220;cultural colonialism&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t blame them for not wanting it in their country and I respect them wanting to keep their own traditions.  When are Western nations going to do likewise and stand up for THEIR traditions?</p>

<p>The same country that went to war only a few years ago to save them!  You might have mentioned that.  Or is that irrelevant?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want our filthy, immoral, alien customs? Fine!   Then don&rsquo;t take our support either.<br>
They happen to be a client state, dependent on the hand that feeds them (and which makes them rich). They&rsquo;re not in a position to be haughty.  We should have left them to Saddam. (And we should have left Saddam alone.)<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure if you examined whatever agreement the U.S. and Kuwait have, it doesn&rsquo;t mention anything about taking on American traditions and Christian holidays.  My guess is it has something to do with military bases and oil.  I&rsquo;m also going to go out on a limb here and guess that Kuwait had two options: 1) be an ally of the U.S. or 2) be an enemy of the U.S.  Not much of a choice; what would YOU do?</p>

			<p> &#8220;it doesn&rsquo;t mention anything about taking on American traditions and Christian holidays. &#8220;<br>
  &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      <br>
Valentine&rsquo;s Day (much like Christmas) has been so secularized today that I&rsquo;m sure most Americans don&rsquo;t even realize it&rsquo;s really <i> Saint </i> Valentine&rsquo;s Day   &mdash;   originally the feast day of a Christian saint. They don&rsquo;t see it as religious. It&rsquo;s a secular festival. Just ask them who St. Valentine was, and I&rsquo;m willing to bet that 99% couldn&rsquo;t tell you. (Even I will have to look him up.)</p>
<p>But I take no offense Kuwaitis reject it; and I certainly don&rsquo;t want to push it on anyone.  Personally, I don&rsquo;t care what they do (as long as they do it in their own country).  They&rsquo;re the ones missing out.  </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s galling is their persistent attitude of intolerance and fanaticism, something that would be condemned as &#8220;xenophobia&#8221; if practiced by us.   Aparently for them it&rsquo;s alright, though.</p>

			<p>I propose that Kuwaitis celebrate &#8220;Honor Killing Day&#8221; on February 14.  They all could publically stone their daughters who have fallen in love during the preceeding year.  A mass stoning of innocent young women would be perfectly in keeping with traditional Islamic values, even if romantic love is not.</p>
<p>In a similar story, a Saudi court has locked up a woman accused of being a &#8220;witch,&#8221; so perhaps an annual Witch Burning Day could also be officially gazetted on the calendars of these medieval people.</p>
