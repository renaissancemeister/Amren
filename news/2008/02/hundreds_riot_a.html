						<p>Reading, PA &mdash; An impromptu celebration of the Dominican Republic&rsquo;s independence day involving as many as 1,500 students outside Reading High School erupted in violence Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>A city police captain was injured and at least a half-dozen students were arrested.</p>
<p>An unruly crowd of 1,000 to 1,500 high school students blocked streets around the school and threw rocks and bottles at police when officers tried to disperse them, authorities said.</p>
<p>Deputy Police Chief Mark E. Talbot Sr. said the violent mob was unprecedented and created one of the scariest situations he&rsquo;s had in his career in Reading.</p>
<p>Some students hit parked cars with baseball bats, and at least one student was reported hurt after someone hit him in the head with a bat, police said.</p>
<p>About 40 police officers &mdash; every on-duty officer in the city &mdash; responded to the melee, investigators said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Acting schools Superintendent Anthony A. Georeno said Wednesday night that students of Dominican descent were involved in a variety of celebrations in the school during the day, including an approved assembly with a speaker.</p>
<p>Georeno said he did not know the name of the speaker nor the topic of his presentation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said they did not know why the students became unruly as they were dismissed from school.</p>
<p>Police said school administrators and staff watched as chaos erupted outside the school and did nothing to help police struggling to control the crowd.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Georeno said a group of students he described as jubilant unfurled a Dominican flag as they left the school and held an impromptu parade.</p>
<p>He said school officials did not intervene because the students were orderly and peaceful as they left school property.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many students waved red, white and blue Dominican flags and wore red shirts as they paraded.</p>
<p>Students shook their fists and yelled as cars passed.</p>
<p>Police said some of them were running onto porches shouting. Neighbors did not know what was going on, and police said they were caught off guard.</p>

I couldn&rsquo;t be more sad.<br>
Didn&rsquo;t even know there were even any dominikins there.<br>
Isn&rsquo;t diversity grand. Much better than dull Whites. <br>

Is there any sane reason why taxpayers have to foot the bill for ethnic or racial &#8216;minority&rsquo; students to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; their heritage during school hours?? </p>
<p>Reading, PA, has traditionally endured Puerto Ricans as the major contributors to its super-high crime rate, now this poor city is burdened with Dominicans, as well. What a shame!</p>

			<p>CofCC Blogmeister is quite right. Allow me to add some perspective. This general area of Pennsylvania is still largely rural and filled with White, and I mean nearly nothing but White families whose lineage(mostly German)goes back generations - until recently. I have been to the outskirts and surrounding areas of Reading many times, and would have had no idea this mutliculti  had spread into such an unlikely area. <br>
I am stunned that that it has come to this!! This country is doomed&hellip;I am so depressed by this article. </p>

<p>CofCC National CEO Gordon Baum is three generations separated from Berks County.  He traces his family lineage in America back more than ten generations, and his family was among the first wave of Germans that settled in PA, having been invited by William Penn, and driven out of the Germanies by religious persecution.  The German-Americans predate an independent America.</p>

			<p>Immigration is driven by global finance and big business.  The more people you can pack into America, the more consumers there are.</p>
<p>The other goal is to divide the country between race and economic class.  A divided populace can&rsquo;t rise as one to challenge the virtual dictatorship of banks and corporations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s classic divide and conquer.  </p>

			<p>As I&rsquo;ve previously posted on Amren, I&rsquo;m from Lancaster/Lebanon county area, I&rsquo;m floored by this. Reading always was a &#8220;bad&#8221; area growing up, but we used to go there shopping at the outlet stores, and Penn State Berks Campus is right there, I had many friends go to school there. This is insane. I thought the Peurto Ricans and Cubans in Lancaster and Lebanon were bad.</p>

			<p>I work in Reading. 20 years ago it was full of shops, safe to walk the streets, and loaded with Pennsylvania-Deutsch culture. Today, the shops are gone, 90% of the people are black or hispanic, few work, and there is an utter disrespect, verging on open hostility, for other people and their property. I have a good friend on the Reading Drug Task Force. He told me the city is lost and the gang and drug problems are so bad it will never recover. There was a lot more property destruction than was mentioned in the article and the actions were targeted at whites. I saw it with my own eyes - it was whites being chased in to their homes and having their cars vandalized the worst, but it&rsquo;s too politically incorrect to mention that.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s the school&rsquo;s fault for having a &#8220;Dominican Republic Day&#8221; in the first place.  I guess the staff at Reading High School doesn&rsquo;t realize that THIS IS AMERICA!  When you cave in and try to be nice to third world criminals, this is what you get in return.  The administrators of Reading High School need to go back to school themselves where they can learn something about human behavior.  Perhaps they indeed have learned a little something about the &#8220;Joys Of Multiculturalism&#8221;. Maybe next year they will have a &#8220;This Is America Day&#8221; if they have learned anything at all.           </p>

			<p>&#8220;An impromptu celebration of the Dominican Republic&rsquo;s independence day involving as many as 1,500 students outside Reading High School erupted in violence Wednesday afternoon.  Chief Mark E. Talbot Sr. said the violent mob was unprecedented and created one of the scariest situations he&rsquo;s had in his career. Police said school administrators and staff watched as chaos erupted outside the school and did nothing to help police struggling to control the crowd.<br>
Georeno said a group of students he described as jubilant unfurled a Dominican flag as they left the school and held an impromptu parade. Many students waved red, white and blue Dominican flags,  and wore red shirts as they paraded.&#8221;<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
I suspect those red shirts have some significance for the Dominican communist party. It&rsquo;s very big among them. I live in New York and we are used to their constant parades and celebrations here. There seems to be something going on all the time.   Also, the heavily Dominican public schools in this area have had their names changed to those of Dominican national heros (eg. Juan Pablo Duarte).  Streets too.  St. Nicholas Avenue is now Duarte Blvd.  This is no longer the USA!   Our schools and streets used to have names like Washington, Jefferson and Madison.  No longer.  Now we celebrate THEIR heros, not ours.</p>
<p>In a place where I was working, a half dozen years ago, we had summer interns who were highschool students.  It was really just a made-up position, involving no work, to give them the excuse for a pay check. These were Dominicans. Dominicans are very arrogant and confrontational, unafraid of anybody (much like Arabs in this respect).  I recall some of them making the wide-open statement,  a defiant challenge, in front of all of us, that some day they were going to take over here, and that all of this would be Dominican.  There was silence.   There was a time when they would have been fired on the spot   &mdash;    a time when Americans had some backbone.  As it is now, given the PC demands of &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221;,  nobody said anything.</p>
<p>Another time, one of them was doing nothing but hanging around and cracking obscene jokes to one of the girls all morning.  I finally asked him if he had anything else to do, and if not I would find him some work. The girl jumped up and ran out of the room!  (I had said nothing to her.)  Several black adults  around were giving me very dirty looks    &mdash;   they thought the obscene juvenile banter was cute.  I was called on the carpet in Mr. Bigshot&rsquo;s office and asked what I had done to get these &#8220;students&#8221; so upset.   I was warned about showing more sensitivity in the future.  Clearly, I was the culprit, not they.  </p>
<p>Can you imagine what would have happened if someone had given them a patriotic tongue-lashing in answer to their challenge about &#8220;taking over&#8221;?  No, this is no longer the USA we grew up in.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the school&rsquo;s fault for having a &ldquo;Dominican Republic Day&rdquo; in the first place. I guess the staff at Reading High School doesn&rsquo;t realize that THIS IS AMERICA! &#8220;<br>

America is being carved up!   Are we witnessing the beginning of the end of the USA?    Moslems want their concessions.  Dominicans demand theirs too.  Mexicans insist on theirs.  Haitians, Hindus, Hmongs&hellip;  everybody!   They all want their chunk of America.  Whatever happened to  &#8220;e pluribus unum&#8221;?  Immigrants don&rsquo;t  come to this country to be Americans anymore, they want to colonize it.</p>
<p>This is where multiculturalism leads.  Are we going the way of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia?  Can nobody else see this but us? </p>

He just doesn&rsquo;t want to say   &mdash;    which I find all the more interesting.  <i> WHY  </i>doesn&rsquo;t he want to say?</p>

			<p>It occurs to me that all these &#8216;foreigners&rsquo; don&rsquo;t really want to be here at all. Sure, some of them &#8216;risk their lives&rsquo; to get here, but alot of them must have their way paid. How much does it cost to move to another country, establish oneself in a home, etc? A lot of money. How many Whites coud afford to make this kind of move? Who is paying for these people to come here when, really and truly, they dont want to leave their homes?! They obviously love their native country! As annoying as they are to Euro-Americans, they seem to be victims too.</p>

			<p>Gotta love diversity that is taking over the government subsidized daycare centers (oops, I mean public schools).  It&rsquo;s a downright disgrace that we can&rsquo;t celebrate nothing American in public schools anymore.  Due to government sanctioned diversity quotas, all cultures must be included even if we must skip over American customs and traditions.  The default liberal position is killing us people, lets wake up!!</p>

			<p>No wonder why Brooklyn is getting better.  All the Dominicans are going to Pennsylvania, as well as upstate New York.  Often it is to be closer to relatives in prison, but they seek the cheap housing as well in those areas.  </p>
<p>They view Whites as weak and have no problem being pushy and demanding.  Dominicans are a very arrogant and surly like most American blacks, but they are a very ignorant people as well prone to outbursts of violence.</p>
<p>I remember about 10 years ago travelling through PA to get away from the &#8220;dversity&#8221; of New York to only come to traffic jam in Lancaster, PA.  What was holding up the traffic, the Puerto Rican Day Parade in Lancaster, PA.</p>

			<p><b>Police said they did not know why the students became unruly.</b></p>
<p>Baloney. Police are well aware of the potential for &#8220;unruliness&#8221; whenever mobs of young blacks congregate. (Roughly 9 out of 10 Dominicans have some African ancestry; most would be identified as either black or mulatto.) As anyone who has lived or worked around  them can testify, blacks, in general, are impetuous, impulsive, disruptive, and violent. The profession of ignorance by the police, above, is nothing more than a politically correct evasion.</p>
<p>As whites fade into demographic oblivion, expect melees such as what happened in Reading to become more common and more deadly. The authorities, in trying to restore order to a disintegrating society, will respond in kind, with the inevitable result being an increasingly militarized police force, the stratification of society into heavily guarded &#8220;safe haven&#8221; communities and outlaw regions resembling warlord fiefdoms, and a consolidation and centralization of state power. As is to be expected, constitutionally guaranteed freedoms will be sacrificed in the name of &#8220;fighting terror&#8221; and &#8220;preserving democracy.&#8221; Indeed, such has already begun.</p>
<p>Then, as now, race realists in the white community will be opposed by the multicult fanatics on the political left. Like the communist drones of an earlier era, these diversitybots are impervious to reason and will defend their failed dogmas to the bitter end. Thus will chronic violence and ethnic conflict continue to be rationalized as a &#8220;justifiable response to oppression,&#8221; with the blame directed at whites for their unyielding &#8220;racism&#8221; and their unwillingness to become slaves for their Third-World masters. Unless whites can set aside their political differences and work together to aggressively assert their civil and constitutional rights, the ugliness that took place at Reading   &mdash;   and that has taken place in New Orleans, Los Angeles, and numerous other locales where civilized norms have disappeared   &mdash;   is but a harbinger of terrible things to come.</p>

They like to consider themselves Spanish, not African. Under the Trujillos, that is what the country officially and proudly claimed to be.  (I&rsquo;ve met Spaniards who don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with them!)  It&rsquo;s like Jamaicans claiming to be British, or Haitians asserting that they are French.</p>
<p>The Dominican racial attitude is a strange thing.  It is schizoid and typically Latin American, full of self-serving excuses, rationalization, and denial. It&rsquo;s very subjective according to just how dark an individual is.   For Dominicans, anything up to <i>their own degree of brownness </i> is OK and they would vehemently object to any type of discrimination.  But anything which is <i>blacker than they are is over the limit </i> and is unacceptable!  India and Pakistan, I understand, are very much like this too. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or cry at this microcosm of the stupidity taking over our country. Exactly why should the school be sponsoring Dominican celebrations? We are in the U.S. Do Dominican schools sponsor celebrations of the U.S. on July 4th? And by the way, New Yorkers (I mean white ones who have not yet fled) consider Dominicans the worst criminals of all, combining all the worst features of blacks and Hispanics. They refer to them as &#8220;P.R.s on steroids.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well actually they share their tiny homeland island of Hispanola with another nation  &mdash;  Haiti, so compared to Haitians, which tend to be jet black, the Dominicans are usually more a brownish color and are more of a mulatto people. While the DR I believe may have a few more spanish looking citizens, the French I believe were exterminated completely during the Haitian Revolution of 1804, although their remains a small mulatto economic elite class on that island.  I think many Domicans have the same mentality as some Mexican Meztizo&rsquo;s who insist on calling themselves &#8220;Spanish&#8221;  although a quick look tells you they most clearly are certainly no Spaniards. </p>
<p>Given the Haitians&rsquo; complete and utter inability to govern themselves or create any sort of economy after the decline of the sugar industry, Haitians go to the DR in the tens of thousands to work/beg/rob every year. I don&rsquo;t think the DR is completely worthless, I have had a few Dominican beers which weren&rsquo;t bad, and they do produce decent baseball players, which is more than Haiti has ever produced.</p>
<p>Periodically throughout DR&rsquo;s history they have periodically deported the Haitian guests en mass or just massacred them in droves when their numbers become too unbearable.</p>
<p>There was a interesting movie released a few years ago called &#8220;the Agronomist&#8221; that I think you can get from blockbuster, about this French Educted Haitian named Jean Dominique who was about the whitest Haitian mulatto you&rsquo;ll ever see who spent years fighting the military dictatorship by running a sort of Haitian pirate radio station. Of course Aristide who dominque supported, turns on Dominque and has him assassinated soon after taking power. Aristide also launched this neo black power movement in Haiti, but of course he crashed and burned in the early 2000s and the Haitian side of Hispanola has remained a giant floating homeless shelter run by the UN ever since. <br>

I didn&rsquo;t know that. But I&rsquo;m certainly not in disagreement  with you for a moment. There is something very aggressive and confrontational about them. I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it.

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;You might be technically within your rights (in defending your home) but who wants to go through that? Is it worth it?</p>
<p>YES!!! For self-defense. But NOT for vigilanteism!</p>
<p>If a mob is breaking into your home, you can justifiably claim fear of your life! It depends on the CIRCUMSTANCES. You have to be able to convince the court you had no way of fleeing. If a mob of Blacks were to be smashing your windows and kicking your door in   &mdash;   you&rsquo;d be 100% WITHIN your rights. I mean WHERE or HOW could you reasonably be expected to flee? In a scenario like you described, how could a court fail to find you guilty   &mdash;   self defense is exactly that!</p>
<p>Bernie Getz was NOT convicted for using a weapon for self-defense. He was charged with carrying an illegal weapon (pistol)! Therein lies the rub. If a few million Whites had the brains and guts to carry (and if absolutely necessary, to USE a weapon) the crime rate would drop! Because the bad guys could never be sure the intended victim might be armed and willing to use a gun in self-defense. The newspapers and gun control freaks would absolutely HATE it   &mdash;   because they&rsquo;d be proven wrong. That a gun, properly used, DOES save lives.</p>
<p>Read the American Rifleman magazine put out by the NRA. They have a monthly column describing events where a gun was used to stave off criminals intent on inflicting harm on would-be victims. The anti-gun crowd will always make the spurious claim guns too often are turned against their owners. But that is almost never the case in reality. Being simply anti-gun propaganda. As to having a few handguns readily available in your home. There are many good hiding places   &mdash;   especially if you&rsquo;re handy with tools. Clips to hold a gun where the kids don&rsquo;t see it   &mdash;   but where your spouse knows she can grab it at the sound of a door being forced, a window breaking.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going about your own lawful business and are attacked, you do have the right of self-defense if flight is neither possible nor feasible (you&rsquo;re surrounded by a bunch of Black punks screaming &#8220;let&rsquo;s kill Whitey.&#8221; As to carrying an illegal weapon   &mdash;   life insurance, no more, no less. You had no intention of using it other than as a last recourse!</p>
<p>Bernie simply went about it wrong. He should have produced and cocked his gun   &mdash;   and not shot unless and until one actually lunged at him with intent to harm him. I carry a gun, if out at night and have reason to believe I might find myself in a mall parking lot where we could be accosted by Black toughs. No, I would NOT shoot until there is no other recourse. But then would shoot to kill (body shots).</p>
<p>Everyone needs to RETHINK their position. I am not about to go out of my way to look for trouble. But refuse to crawl on my belly for a pack of primitive morons either. You want MY blood, you better be ready to pay a stiff price   &mdash;   is my motto. Our Constitution, in spite of Bush&rsquo;s best efforts to dismantle it, does guarantee one&rsquo;s right to defend himself against criminal elements. We American men need to remember we are MEN   &mdash;   and act like it, if the situation arises. Not as vigilantees, but ready and willing to defend ourselves. Therein lies the difference!</p>
