						<p>Kosovo insurgents declared independence from Serbia, Sunday, February 18, 2008.</p>
<p>The Muslim terrorist Kosovo Liberation Army was established in the mid 1990s. Its goal was to create a greater Muslim Albania out of Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo. Kosovo has been under a United Nations protectorate since the end of the war that saw Kosovo taken from Serbia in 1999.</p>
<p>Life in Kosovo has been a nightmare for Serbians and Roma (gypsies). Muslim Albanians civilians have burned many Christian churches, forced Serbians to flee the province and terrorized those that remained. Law enforcement by the United Nation forces have been colossally ineffective at maintaining the peace and to complicate matters the Muslim terrorists who grappled the province from Serbia were given police roles by the UN protectorate. Under UN protection they insurgents also have control of the Parliament. This is like assigning the mice to guard the cheese.</p>
<p>Serbia after the war was corrupted into a puppet government role by the United States, which promised economic aid and a path for elitists in Serbia to get rich on post war reconstruction in exchange for submission and tolerance of the UN protectorate of Kosovo.</p>
<p>After more than 8 years, the inevitable is happening. The Albanian terrorist who were exempted by the United States government of Bill Clinton from signing the UN agreement over the role of the UN in the province have unilaterally declared independence in violation of the United Nation resolution that created the protectorate.</p>
<p>The post-war government of Serbia which since its establishment has been happy to bank the money the United States government provides and stay neutral is now forced to take a nationalistic stand (at least temporarily) to assuage the anger of the Serbian people. As it stands today, the Serbian government has categorically declared that the Serbian people will never accept Kosovo´s independence at the hands of Albanian Muslim insurgents.</p>
<p>The United Nations has been put into a difficult situation. The Albania Muslims in Kosovo have declared their independence from both Serbia and the United Nations. Should the UN accept the declaration of independence or should it maintain its grip of authority?</p>
<p>Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, and Serbia have lodged a complaint claiming that only the United Nations has the authority to accept or reject Kosovo´s independence. It is also believed by international legal scholars that Serbia must have a say in the matter of independence if there is to be one.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the European Union is trying to elbow in. The EU got involved indirectly through NATOs participation during the 79 day bombing of Serbia. The Kosovo Liberation Army had foot soldiers but not a navy or an air force. The United States and NATO filled in as the air force of the Muslim insurgents without going as far was flying the KLA flag on the airplane tails. The KLA was handed a victory by the U.S. and NATOs air force. NATO meddling was a violation of its charter. NATO is not authorized to be an offensive force. Its charter only allows NATO member participation when another NATO member comes under attack. Serbia was fighting insurgents financed by Bin Laden, among others, with the money and armament channeled through Albania. The fighting took place exclusively within Serbian territory.</p>
<p>The CIA secretly provided armament to the Muslim insurgents invalidating any semblance of neutrality for the United States in the post war accommodations. The fighting in Kosovo was a civil war fought within Serbian territory. No NATO country was threatened or invaded. NATOs bombing were the first time its military power was used offensively. The inappropriate use of force sets a tarnished precedent for its relevancy and credibility.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Do the remaining Serbians in Kosovo have anything to fear from the insurgent Albanian Muslims declaration of independence today?</p>
<p>George Bush, from a press conference while on his tour of Africa, assured the Serbian people Sunday that they are safe living in Kosovo. But wait, before you die laughing: George Bush also assured them that the border between Serbia and Kosovo will be secured &mdash; guaranteed!<br>

															<h2><a href="http://www.javno.com/en/world/clanak.php?id=124499">Free Kosovo a Door for Islamic Radicals</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>Javno (Croatia), February 17, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Independent Kosovo will endanger the stability in the Balkans once again, estimated the American ambassador at the UN, John Bolton.</p>
<p>I think that there is a significant risk that the instability in the Balkans will continue in Bosnia and other areas where ethnic groups do not live in a country they refuse, said Bolton in an interview for Glas Amerike reported in Serbian language.</p>
<p>Kosovo will be a weak country submissive to Islamic radical forces which will spread its influence in the area with the support of singular Albanians and so potentially open the door to radicals in Europe, Bolton estimated.</p>

			<p>Saw a poster in front of a store today (the store is located on Flamingo Rd. just before Paradise Rd.) that said, &#8220;Thank You America for supporting Kosovo independence.&#8221; I almost got out of my car and ripped it down. George Bush has hit an all-time low with this one. Instead of siding with White-Christians he has created a new Muslim country. The Serbs should have claimed to be part black and then maybe Bush would have given them a fair shake.</p>

			<p>Draft the sons of the neo-cons and liberals, and force them to drive the Moslems out.  Send them into battle with Serbian machine gunners at their rear, to ensure that they do not retreat.  There&rsquo;s no reason that WN or Serbians should die rectifying the crimes of Washington.  </p>

			<p>Every people has the right to form a homogeneous nation that looks after itself, rather than being part of a multiculti, multiracial hodgepodge empire.  Kosovo is doing nothing different from what we wish for ourselves.  If we don&rsquo;t stand up for the right to self-determination for them, no one will stand up for us when we claim it for ourselves.</p>

			<p>Bush and Clinton are maniacs for supporting ANYONE in this ostensible Yugo-Balkan civil war. That Bush wants Kosovo independent shows that he is true believer in his father&rsquo;s &#8220;New World Order.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Forest Bush&rsquo;s neo-con advisors not only wanted Clinton to bomb Serbia in order to get their minds &#8220;right&#8221; about multiculturalism, they are advising him on what to do now, just as they advised him to convert old East Bloc countries into launching pads for NATA missiles, enraging Russia in the process, and they certainly have a right to be outraged.</p>
<p>Starting unnecessary wars that kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people and starting up the cold war again is what Forest does best anymore.</p>
<p>Because of the leadership of this country there is no way I&rsquo;ll ever support a war against whites in Russia or anywhere else as long as I live, and if one ever started, I would actively work in their interests.  </p>
<p>This country is degenerating into a non-white hell hole that doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be defended by any white, but the dumbest ones on the radical left.</p>

			<p>So when the mexicans who are taking over the southwest of the United States reach a critical mass and declare independence from these same United States, will George Bush also guarantee the new border between us; Or perhaps when other large sections of Europe are taken over by islamics will the United States, the conquered European nations, and the U.N. also posit it&rsquo;s guarantees? The colossal stupidity, or perhaps traitorously evil motives of this move, is evident for anyone who has eyes to see. Serbia and Russia have every reason to be angry. They are right and we are horribly wrong. We are risking war once again.</p>

			<p>This is news to me.  I thought the newest muslim country was Britain.  Didn&rsquo;t the Anglican church just implement sharia law?  And how exactly will that work with their gay bishop issue?  The Brits used to be really good at beheading, but they may be out of practice.  Perhaps a bishop named Hussein is in order.  He might get along really well with a possible next American president, also named Hussein.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kosovo will be a weak country submissive to Islamic radical forces which will spread its influence in the area with the support of singular Albanians and so potentially open the door to radicals in Europe, Bolton estimated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet the United States supports Kosovar independence?</p>
<p>Look at the flags the protesters were carrying in their street celebrations.  Albanian.</p>
<p>This is yet another double-speak rhetorical sham.  Leaders and their employees who denounce events that they help spark.  </p>
<p>Nationalism will never be eradicated from the more impoverished people of the world.  It is extremely divisive but there is nothing that can be done.</p>
<p>Yet another policy that screws over a potential ally in favor of terrorists.  (African &#8220;decolonization&#8221;, supporting &#8220;&#8221;democracy&#8221;&#8221; in former USSR &amp; East Bloc, American foreign policy in Latin America, the list goes on&hellip;)</p>

			<p>If Kosovo can secede from Serbia because Albanians are now the majority there, why can&rsquo;t southern California and Texas secede from America by the same logic? The U.S. should NEVER have gotten involved in this matter which was none of its concern. What did Serbia ever do to the United States? A country that was a loyal ally of America in two wars and this is the treatment it gets! If anyone is interested Patrick Buchanan has an outstanding article on this whole matter. Bit by bit, in ways never imagined American foreign policy (which is evil, wicked and immoral) is coming back on America. You reap what you sow. </p>

			<p>My local newspaper has a phone-in line called &#8220;The Vent&#8221;, in which people call in and&hellip;vent. I called about this after the paper ran a front page story about this, and in response to the announcment of the new &#8220;multiethnic state&#8221; of Kosovo, I said that Yugoslavia broke up *because* it was multiethnic, and that this whole thing reeked of the U.N. Naturally my vent wasn&rsquo;t published, because it pointed out the truth. <br>
I suggest that all the readers here send a letter to their local papers, and briefly remind them of Baltic history, (I would just stick to the 20th century).</p>

			<p> The Serbs fought the Turks thus weakening them and in the process saved Western Europe from those barbarians. This is how liberal Europe returns the favour.</p>

			<p>Why did the US get involved in Kosavo? Our Saudi Masters ordered us in. The Serbs were easily defeating the Moslem&hellip;er&hellip;ethnic Albanians, and the saudis sent us to prevent the christian victory.<br>
    All is not lost. All the US has to do is withdraw the 16,000 soldiers there. They are needed in Iraq.  If the Serbs attack, and massacre the KLA, let them. You cannot hold back the anger caused by 400 years of Islamic opression. After the serbs win, they may forgive us in a few generations.<br>
    BTW, I blame the 9/11 attacks on our intervention in Kosovo. The Mslems saw that we were weak and attacked.  </p>

			<p>Pro-white discourse on the Balkans is saturated with ignorance as can be seen here.  </p>
<p>&#8220;EA (European American) Steve&#8221; says the Serbs prevented the Muslims from advancing on Europe, but the last time I checked the Turks got as far as Vienna.  Poster &#8220;Jacqui in AZ&#8221; feels the need to remind others of Baltic histroy despite the fact that Estonia lies a long ways from Kosovo.  </p>
<p>The fact that most Kosovar Albanians are nominally moslem due to historical reasons does not change the fact that the conflict was an ethnic, not religious one.  Many Catholic Albanian Kosovars fought against the Serbs also.  Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs have long been at eachother&rsquo;s throats with the two groups even destroying eachothers churches.  Supporting one european group against another is not good racial policy as far as I, and many others, are concerned.  <br>

			<p>   I&rsquo;ve maintained since Clinton&rsquo;s destruction of the Serbian infrastructure that we were on the wrong side in that war . In my layman&rsquo;s opinion Serbia has a historical and valid claim to that territory . God bless Prince Lazar and his courageous knights . Because of them and others like them, our culture was allowed to grow and flourish outside of Muslim influence .And we repay them by siding with their (our) enemies . I just can&rsquo;t understand it . And I did squawk to my liberal local paper by posing the question, what is the difference in Kosovo declaring it&rsquo;s independence  and Montana declaring it&rsquo;s independence after 100 years or so of theoretical Canadian immigration there ? Of course it went unprinted .</p>

			<p>I just cant believe what the British and American governments have done.</p>
<p>They have advanced the Islamisation of Europe and, together with their support for Turkeys enrollment into the European Union, have signed our death warrants.</p>
<p>I always appreciated living in a time where, unlike my parents and grandparents, I had not had fight for my nations survival. </p>
<p>Now I feel that in my lifetime there will be a war in Europe - and at this rate it looks like the Russians will be the good guys!</p>

			<p>Pres. Pervez Musharraf is one of staunch allies in the war on terror. Pres. Bush calls his electoral defeat &#8220;victory in the war on terror.&#8221;</p>
<p>This must be another one of Bush&rsquo;s &#8220;victory in the war on terror.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kosovo will soon become another West Bank/Gaza. They will demand more and more of Serbia, trade land for peace. It will become a training camp and a launch pad for terrorist. Not just against Serbia, but the rest of Europe as well. </p>
<p>&#8220;What did Serbia ever do to the United States?&#8221;<br>
They are Christian. Bush hates Christians.</p>

			<p>The privileged international elite are against any manifestation of ethnic nationalism. Serbs are the new Nazis to this crowd, when in reality it was the Muslims of the Balkans who actively collaborated with the Nazis. The Serbs lost heavily in their fight against Hitler. </p>
<p>But then why do they tolerant Albanian ethnocentrisms? The ruling elite want to show that they are not against the religion of Islam, which, of course, they really are. This is a just smoke screen for moderate western-oriented Muslims and won&rsquo;t work in the long run. Most Muslims will not turn into nice peaceful little liberals. A dependent, criminally-oriented Muslim state in the heart of Europe will only lead to trouble in the future. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe the baloney about Kosovo being a multi-ethnic state.  They could have remained with Serbia and been multiethiic. Now they are a Albanian State.<br>

			<p>As Kyle Rogers wrote at cofcc.org:</p>
<p>The events also set a frightening precedent. Imagine if Mexicans declare that California is an independent country. The receive money,  arms, and more volunteer fighters from Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela. A campaign of ethnic cleansing begins and whites, blacks, and Asians are killed or chased across the border into neighboring states.</p>
<p>When the US military mobilizes against this terrorist army, the EU declares war on us and bombs the US military, government buildings, utility companies, and television and radio stations.  Once the US government cries uncle, the president is arrested for &ldquo;war crimes,&rdquo; while international &ldquo;peace keepers&rdquo; aid the terrorists in consolidating control of the territory.</p>
<p>This scenario would be no different that what the US and NATO did to Serbia. </p>

			<p>I lived in Slovenia during the time of the NATO led bombing campaign in Yugoslavia (Serbia/Kosovo).  I had watched the very real genocide going on and had Serbian friends who hated Milosevic because he led an army of paramilitaries who did not only murder and rape their way through mixed communities, but went out of their way in Sarajevo for example to loot homes of valuables after Serbs had fled the fighting.</p>
<p>Albanians are by the way, just as white as Serbians, it is the relgion and culture that is different.  Muslims (Ottoman Turks) in the Balkans have been the cause of over 400 years of oppression and suffering of Christians, and in particular - Serbs.</p>
<p>That aside, for a good year before the bombing campaign both Serbs but especially Albanians were arrving in droves into Slovenia.  Everyone who could fled Kosovo. Stories of horrible rapes in the presence of families and consequential suicides of the victims were rampant.</p>
<p>So, even though I understood that the Albanian were Muslims, I agreed with the NATO action to stop what was going on.  I had some pretty heated arguments with a few people.  To illustrate how intimate the situation was for me, my (American) wife and I were at the U.S. Embassy getting out papers set up to get married while my dear friend and receptionist was outside in a crowd protesting the bombing campaign.  I did not fault her for wishing not to see her country bombed for any reason.  Later, she was in that crowd of student in Belgrade that demonstrated until Milosevic fled the capital and was eventually arrested.  A brave young woman who I admire a great deal.</p>
<p>At the time of the U.S. led NATO bombing campaign, all the NATO countries involved, including the U.S. guaranteed the Serbs that Albanians would not be allowed to annex Kosovo.  That was part of the agreement to end the Serbian actions in Kosovo, etc.  Albanians had been crowding into Kosovo for many years.  In 1982 as was stated last week on a BBC program by Kosovar Albians - the Albanians began a &#8220;revolution&#8221; to take over Kosovo.  It must be understood that Serbs had been harassed in Kosovo for years before Milosevic arrived with his radical responses.  It is also useful to understand that Marshall Tito, who had formed the communist Yugoslave state after WW2, was Croatian and understood that the Serbs had to be kept in check.  So it was he who began the problem by importing Albanians into Kosovo - Albania was never part of either the Kingdom of Yugoslavia or the communist nation of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is why I now support the Serbs.  The U.S. and the other supporting nations had stabbed the Serbs in the back just the way the Habsburgs did in 1878 when the Serbs so courageously rose and threw out the Ottomans.  The Roman Catholilc Austrians made a deal with their enemy of hundreds of years to suppress the Orthodox Christian Serbs, who both worried about.  This betrayal led to the original subversive group named &#8220;The Black Hand,&#8221; that sought revenge against Serbian oppressors.  One young man, Gravilo Princip evntually managed to assinate the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand, leading to the series of reactions that led to WW1.</p>
<p>No one ever seems to learn.  What happens in the Balkans seems to resonate throughout the world.  It is as important as the Middle East in that way, but not so well understood.</p>
<p>But all the Amren posters who see the analogy between the Albanian Kosovar takeover of this ancient and holy part of Serbia by non-Serbs are COMPLETELY CORRECT.  I only hope they understand it completely - hence my post.  Support fot the Albanian Kosovo only encourages other regions like the U.S. Southwest to eventually claim independence from the U.S.  I agree with Russia, China, and any other country that criticizes the recognition or support of Albanian Kosovo.  They have in fact supported a clandestine Islamic insurgency.</p>

			<p>Allowing Kosovo to become independant sets a dangerous precedent and will serve as an inspiration and model to seperatist movements around the world (including the Aztlaners here in the USA). The Russians were smart not to recognize Kosovo, but then again, Russia seems to have much more nationalistic leadership than we do. Our leaders are weak, foolish, and seem to care about the well-being of everyone except actual Americans, hence every immigration debate seems to revolve around &#8220;what&rsquo;s good for the immigrants&#8221; instead of &#8220;what&rsquo;s good for US!&#8221; I&rsquo;m afraid there are dark times ahead for many countries with seperatist movements around the world, including the USA. I think that regardless of who wins the presidency in 2008, the immigration situation in the US is going to get worse, not better and the road to a second civil war (along the lines of what Chittum talked about in his book Civil War 2) will be accelerated. America will end up much like the balkans and I will be suprised if we&rsquo;re not fighting a massive and bloody civil war on our own soil before 2025 or so.</p>

<p>I used to think so, but now I doubt it.  I&rsquo;ve always had the theory that the US has avoided many of the problems Europe has had with much smaller minorities because we simply have more space and people can get away from each other.  America is still a very underpopulated country for the amount of landmass we&rsquo;ve got.  For example, we have about the same amount of square kms as China but a quarter of the population.</p>
<p>Americans of different races will continue to be able to avoid each other for a long time.  Maybe all this diversity will eventually make any kind of strong central government impossible and we&rsquo;ll eventually get back to our federalist roots.  It may be the best we can ask for at this point, to hope for whites to eventually regain/hold on to all of America is unrealistic in my opinion.</p>

			<p>&#8220;EA (European American) Steve&rdquo; says the Serbs prevented the Muslims from advancing on Europe, but the last time I checked the Turks got as far as Vienna.&#8221; </p>
<p>Posted by castriota at 12:33 AM on February 21 </p>
<p>I must have misphrased what I was exactly saying. Yes, the Turks entered Vienna and possibly Germany. However, I was talking about the ethnic Albanians. I didn&rsquo;t even intend to say that even they (direct ancestors of Albanians), didn&rsquo;t march North and West of Serbia. However, it can&rsquo;t be denied that the Serbs help contain the spread of the Albanians and Turks. If they didn&rsquo;t resist, it&rsquo;s possible that Albania&rsquo;s population would be living in Austria and maybe even Southeastern Germany, today, in significant numbers. </p>
<p>What you are probably thinking about is the Battle of Vienna, in 1683. If so, that was the Ottoman Empire. </p>

			<p>The REAL POINT is the United States HAD NO BUSINESS interfering in the Balkans. This was NOT America&rsquo;s concern. That is the true most fundamental point which so many of you do not get. It is not a matter of whether the Serbs were more &#8220;evil&#8221; then the Albanians or vice-versa. That is besides the point. The U.S. had no business being there in the first place. Can&rsquo;t you folks get it? In any case Kosovo will now want to join Albania and then they will want western Macedonia too which has many Albanians as well. If history teaches one thing about the Balkans it is to not touch this place with a ten-foot pole!</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s funny how when the Serbians put down an Islamic rebellion in their own country, the USA actively opposes it through NATO.  But, when we are confronted with Islamic terrorism, we feel it is appropriate to fight a war across the world in a country that didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the terrorism.</p>
<p>The Serbians have every right to hate the USA for participating in this injury to their nation.  Orthodox churches dot the countryside of Kosovo, and Muslim Albanians have destroyed them.  We should be ashamed of what we&rsquo;ve done to a Christian nation.</p>

<p>Posted by flyingtiger at 12:23 AM on February 21 </p>
<p>I agree. Here&rsquo;s a different slant on the situation:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Like every other president of the 20th century, Clinton had carte blanche to do anything he pleased outside the country. <br>
    <br>
Remember Monica Lewinsky? As Clinton&rsquo;s sex scandals began to surface, he tried to divert attention. Embracing foreign intervention with a vengeance, he began firing &lsquo;Monica missiles&rsquo; into Serbia, Iraq, Sudan and Afghanistan. <br>
    <br>
We will never know how many innocent people died under the hail of Clinton&rsquo;s Monica missiles, but we can be certain their families and friends were not happy about it. <br>
    <br>
If someone killed your child or spouse in order to draw attention from his sexual blunders, how would you feel? What would you do? <br>
    <br>
What would be your attitude toward the people he represents when they refused to do anything about him? </p>
<p>This war should be called Clinton&rsquo;s War. </p>
<p>Apparently, the Monica missiles were the last straw, and September 11th began the retaliation&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The only way out of this is for Americans to swallow their pride and admit that their government&rsquo;s foreign policy has been brutal and insane. </p>
<p>Washington must get neutral and stop meddling in other nations. There is no rational or ethical alternative&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>http://www.chaostan.com/Oct01_EWR.html</p>
<p>I fear a coming conscription.  It will be a cold day in hell before my sons are marched into a TEN century religious and civil war fought by guerrillas in the Balkans, Afghanistan,  and Iraq.</p>
<p>And John McAmnesty believes American mothers should sacrifice their children into this insanity for the next 100 years?</p>
<p>There is no justification for the US to meddle in the affairs of ANY country.  No Justification.</p>

<p>Good points but I disagree.  It is not only contentiousness and hatred boiling about in a small space that causes civil wars, it is multicultural tribes who have nothing in common and are constantly at each others throats pushed to the limit in cases of severe economic drops.  And when a group like blacks, who fight with everybody over nothing during economic boom times, are added to the mix, lots of space isn&rsquo;t gong to halt their contentiousness during hard times.  They&rsquo;ll be at war with everybody over some perceived injustice.  </p>
<p>Just look at how they act during periods when the economy is booming. Right now they&rsquo;re fighting with Hispanics in Calif at a pretty brisk pace. <br>

<p>Agreed. I&rsquo;m sick of our government wasting billions as well as causing the maiming and deaths of american soldiers over something that has nothing to do with us. Unlike Dubya, I don&rsquo;t care about bringing democracy to the middle east. Let them have their own 12th century societies. By the same token, I don&rsquo;t want them in OUR country either. Leave the Balkans to the Balkans and let them deal with it.

The Serbs had not done a DAMN thing to us to provoke what we did to them! Yes, there were some Serb atrocities against the Muslims. But there had been as many Muslim atrocities committed against the Serbs (that continue under our watch in Kosovo right now). I always liked the Serbian people. They alone in that region had fought the Nazis and rescued many of our downed pilots during WWII. If any Serbs are out there reading this, hear me, for I speak for most Americans: I am so sorry, sorry, sorry, for what our government under Clinton did to you!</p>

Americans think they can stick their nose in anywhere they want, whenever they want and then just walk away when they get bored. The 9/11 attacks were the first indication that this was not true. There will be more. Karma is a funny thing. It always balances out things. The U.S. has senselessly made an enemy of 11 million Serbs when it could have had friendship, or at least neutral feelings. It&rsquo;s funny how things play out. Did the Kaiser ever imagine when he gave his &#8216;blank check&rsquo; to Vienna in July 1914 that it would lead to a world war and his abdication? Probably not. Things have a way of happening. The U.S. is building up an awful lot of very bad karma. It will come back on you someday. &#8216;For want of a nail the kingdom was lost&rsquo;.

			<p>This is a complex issue. I understand many of the points that have been made, the Serbs&rsquo; disillusionment with Kosovo&rsquo;s independence, and the potential problems that could arise from this. But here are some other things to consider to get the whole picture. </p>
<p>Kosovo is 90% ethnic Albanian.  During the Yugoslav war, one of Serbia&rsquo;s leaders said that wherever there is even one Serb, that is Serbia. That would mean U.S.A. is actually Serbia. Serbs need to understand the world does not revolve around them; they are inflated with pride. Also, if the Serbs are so in love with Kosovo, then why did they all leave and let the Muslims take over? I would think they all would have been flocking in droves to this beloved place and protecting it from Muslims. </p>
<p>Also, the disintegration of Yugoslavia started when Milosevic, backed by the will of the Serbian people, started to stir things up in Kosovo. Instead of trying to build a greater Serbia through war, he could have tried to negotiate some kind of deal or solution with the help of Western diplomats. Perhaps Yugoslavia would have been saved as well as many people&rsquo;s lives. </p>
<p>That brings up the next point.  It would be nice if the Serbs had as much concern for &#8220;white Christians&#8221; as AR readers do. The Serbian army and paramilitary had no mercy on its fellow white Christians in Croatia. Does no one remember the horrific events in Vukovar where hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered and Dubrovnik was shelled for no reason. I know about WWII and the whole history, but there were atrocities on both sides (which is never mentioned). Also, that was a long time ago and does not justify anything. But Serbs can never let go of the past. That&rsquo;s why they also damaged the Croatian embassy during the riots, even though Croatia had nothing to do with the recognition of Kosovo and has not even recognized it yet. This makes them lose credibility - they appear to just want violence for the sake of violence. Any Serbian leader who has promoted the idea of forgetting the past, moving on and integrating into Europe like other countries in the region, has either been assassinated or almost assassinated. </p>

<p>  &#8220;If the Serbs are so in love with Kosovo why did they all leave and let the Muslems take over&#8221;,,</p>
<p> By this logic the White flight from California gives Mexico legal claim to California then?</p>
<p> By the way Serbs didn&rsquo;t &#8220;leave&#8221; Kosovo, they were driven out by the Ottomans and later the Albanians. Also it was hundreds of thousands of SERBS, not CROATIANS who were killed in WW2. </p>
<p> But all of this is irrelevent. Maybe Kosovo would have declared independence anyways but the point is the United States NEVER should have become involved in this matter. It wasn&rsquo;t America&rsquo;s business.</p>

			<p>While this is a pity, even a cursory glance at recent history makes it easy to see how this came to be: If Serbia&rsquo;s leadership had not tolerated raving, psychopathic career criminals like the late, unlamented Zeljko Raznatovic, a.k.a. &#8220;Arkan&#8221; 16 years ago, this would probably never have happened.  His &#8220;Tiger&#8221; militia did things that would have made the SS puke.</p>
<p>It is always difficult after a war to return things to the way they were.  War&rsquo;s break things up; that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re for.</p>

			<p>If the Albanians want seperation, fine.  Just as the Serbs wanted to be independent of Austrian rule in 1914.</p>

<p>   The point is that the United States had no national interest in the territory of ex-Yugoslavia. How much money did the 78-day bombing campaign against Serbia cost the U.S. taxpayer? It probably would have paved 100 miles of road in Alabama. Or built a new wing on a hospital in Boston. Or built a new school in Kansas. Americans are slightly less healthy, slightly less-well educated and drive on worse roads to whatever extent the cost was. Americans gained the bitter animosity of China when the Chinese embassy was bombed. America alienated Russia and helped turn that country from political reform. Yeltsin was made to look weak and the reactionaries were strengthened. Serbs one of the increasingly rare pro-American peoples in Europe became a bitter enemy. America also has now established a very dangerous precedent of secessionism that could return to haunt it someday in the southwest. Now the U.S. has Nato fighting in Afghanistan (nowhere near the North Atlantic by the way) and wants to station Nato troops in the WEST BANK (Palestine). This idea wont fly very far. Unlike America, Europeans are not masochists. They actually believe that a country&rsquo;s foreign policy should be to benefit itself.  HOW DID AMERICANS PROFIT FROM THE INTERVENTION?</p>

			<p>I keep waiting for the day a group of wronged foreign nationals from a country Washington savaged for no legitimate reason to visit American and exact payback from our warmongering politicians.  On that day Americans of consiquence will cheer&hellip; </p>

<p> The DIFFERENCE is that the United States wasn&rsquo;t involved in the Balkans in 1914 and Serbs didn&rsquo;t expect Americans to do their fighting for them. (SIGH). So many of you posters just don&rsquo;t get it. America should be minding its OWN BUSINESS. Where is the American intervention in Turkey on behalf of the Kurds? As long as Turkey follows Washington&rsquo;s script it can commit whatver atrocities it wants to. The Bush administration even had the gall to decline to admit to the Armenian holocaust.</p>

			<p>6:02 PM POSTER:</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s called BLOWBACK and don&rsquo;t worry it will happen. The 9/11 attacks were basically BLOWBACK for America&rsquo;s policies in the middle east (however disagreeable that may sound to most Americans). What particularly upset Bin Laden was the presence of American military bases in Saudi Arabia. The greatest tragedy of the 9/11 attacks was that Americans didn&rsquo;t get self-reflective and TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY they were attacked. They simply swallowed the Bush Administration lie (as they would later swallow the WMD lie) that America was attacked because it is &#8220;free&#8221;. Funny how so many other free countries were NOT attacked though. The Government didn&rsquo;t want ordinary Americans to think about the foreign policy it has in place around the world and questioning the wisdom (and morality) of the American imperium, in particular Washington&rsquo;s habit of always fishing in troubled waters, often under the guise of &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; intervention. The 9/11 attacks clearly proved America IS TOUCHABLE. Its nuclear weapons, twelve aircraft carriers, the marines and 500 BILLION dollar &#8220;defense&#8221; budgets did nothing to protect Americans. </p>

			<p>No, the US didn&rsquo;t have any interest in Serbia, until the mass-murders in Eastern Slavonia and southern Bosnia started.  Think about it.  Ordinary Americans who had no other interest in any fight at all, anywhere, went there.</p>
<p>I was glad when the Russians went into Serbian-occupied territory, as the Russians were people the Serbs would trust, and thus help de-escalate the hate.</p>
