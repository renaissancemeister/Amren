<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>AMSTERDAM, 07/02/08 &mdash; The city of Amsterdam has developed teaching material warning children against the politics of Geert Wilders, newspaper De Telegraaf yesterday reported. Wilders calls the campaign &#8220;sickening&#8221;.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted from a letter that the city council has sent to three hundred primary and secondary schools in Amsterdam. Primary school heads believe that the letter is intended to anticipate the anti-Islam film that Wilders, MP and leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV), intends to release in March.</p>
<p>The letter, which the newspaper claims is intended as teaching material, contains cartoons of Wilders, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende and a white family that wants nothing to do with a polite Islamic boy. The text reads: &lsquo;If you say bad things about someone, they will feel hurt. They may not dare to say anything in return, because they are afraid of being hurt even more. Then there is not much left of freedom of speech,&rsquo; according to De Telegraaf.</p>
<p>The Amsterdam council, which is dominated by Labour (PvdA), concludes the pamphlet with the words, &lsquo;Unfortunately there are politicians who think they will become more popular by being extremely negative about certain groups of people. They think you should be able to say anything, even if it is hurtful. But this does not make things very pleasant in the Netherlands, as before you know it, they are setting one against the other&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Amsterdam city council stated that the message did not only refer to Wilders&rsquo; opinions. Moreover, the &lsquo;teaching letter&rsquo; also calls on pupils to talk to each other and respect each other&rsquo;s views, the spokesman pointed out.</p>
<p>Wilders responded indignantly to the letter. &#8220;Sickening. Leaflets like this should not be subsidised. The contents are prejudiced and inaccurate. If you decide to do this, then write about the cowardice of the PvdA and the multicultural drama as well.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The alderman responsible for the above mentioned furthering of double speak and indoctrination in Amsterdam schools is the black Labour woman Hennah Buyne, from afro-Surinam birth. <br>
This is what you get if you have affirmative action, &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and multiculturalism. It&rsquo;s pure bigotry and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>&gt; If you say bad things about someone, they will feel hurt. They may not dare to say anything in return, because they are afraid of being hurt even more. Then there is not much left of freedom of speech,&rsquo; &gt;</p>
<p>See how they undermine civil rights in order to rise minorities to a supreme moral position and put the blame on us.</p>
<p>&gt; &lsquo;Unfortunately there are politicians who think they will become more popular by being extremely negative about certain groups of people. They think you should be able to say anything, even if it is hurtful. But this does not make things very pleasant in the Netherlands, as before you know it, they are setting one against the other&rsquo;. &gt;</p>
<p>Note the ideology of victimism and the sneaky innuendo: they&rsquo;re demonizing right wing politicians such as Mr. Wilders without even mentioning his name.<br>
Please also note they are projecting their own intolerance and hate unto conservatives.</p>
<p>The mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, is the biggest advocate of this bigotry. He will never hesitate to set the example of World War II: whoever criticises islam or minorities is responsible for deportation and extermination of these groups, as happened with the Jews. </p>

			<p>I have a feeling this will backfire.  Most school kids probably don&rsquo;t know who Wilders is, now they will know that the establishment doesn&rsquo;t like him.</p>

<p>No, they won&rsquo;t say anything in return; they&rsquo;ll simply shoot you.  For those idiots to express a concern for freedom of speech is ludicrous.  They, themselves, are a major threat to it.</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;re always against this kind of thing, hurt feelings, stereo-typing, prejudice, unless it&rsquo;s directed toward whites, then it&rsquo;s the height of enlightenment. </p>

			<p>This &#8216;cartoon&rsquo; of Wilders was not intended only for primary and secondary students. Would the children ever know about it if this &#8216;teaching material&rsquo; hadn&rsquo;t been introduced? Let kids be kids. The kid-lifespan is shrinking fast.  </p>

			<p>Beware, lest the justice for which you clamor come to you, swift and without mercy.  Justice will come.  The just cometh.  Beware.</p>
<p>(Off topic, but did anyone see Senator Clinton praise John McCain yesterday?  I see glimmerings of the future campaign.  The Clintons  will refrain from personal attack and speak, instead, of an electorate nervous, jittery and unstable.  By indirection will they remind the voter of McCain&rsquo;s reputation as a firebrand and paint him a candidate too mercurial and Manchurian.  Hacks they may be, but very clever ones.)</p>

			<p>  The forbearers of my Dutch surname settled in New Amsterdam in 1662.  Honestly, with all the gutlessness and hypocrisy and insanity showed by so many in the Netherlands I&rsquo;m almost ashamed to have a Dutch name!!</p>

			<p>Mr. Wilders is a hero, especially as his very life is threatened (for doing what he is doing). What&rsquo;s next? Maybe the Dutch self-haters will attack the ancestors of some them (the Dutch), the Franks. </p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how horrible it was for Charles Martel and the Franks to kick out the Muslims. How dare he hurt Islamic feelings?!&#8221;</p>
<p>It hurts the invaders&rsquo; feelings, when you just defend yourself!</p>
