			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Zimbabwe on Saturday accused the West of waging biological warfare and starting a cholera epidemic that has killed hundreds of people and sickened thousands.</p>
<p>The state-run Herald newspaper quoted the information minister, Sikhanyiso Ndlovu, as blaming the cholera outbreak on &#8220;serious biological chemical war &hellip; a genocidal onslaught on the people of Zimbabwe by the British.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cholera is a calculated racist terrorist attack on Zimbabwe by the unrepentant former colonial power which has enlisted support from its American and Western allies so that they invade the country,&#8221; Ndlovu was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The Herald said comments by the U.S. ambassador that the United States had been preparing for the cholera outbreak had raised suspicions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President Robert Mugabe said Thursday that his government, with the help of international agencies, had contained the epidemic.<br>

								<h2>Zimbabwe Unveils 500 Million Dollar Note</h2>
						<p>
							<i>AFP, December 13, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s central bank has introduced a 500 million dollar note, as the African country struggles to cope with the world&rsquo;s highest inflation and crippling currency shortages.</p>
<p>The half-billon note, worth about $US10 ($A14.89), was released on Friday, together with a 200 million dollar bill, which the central bank said in a statement was introduced for the &#8220;convenience&#8221; of the public.</p>
<p>Finance minister Samuel Mumbengegwi announced the new bills in a government gazette, bringing to 29 the number of new notes put into circulation this year alone.</p>
<p>Just last Thursday, Zimbabwe introduced a 100 million dollar bill that at the time was worth $US14 ($A20.84). One week later, it&rsquo;s worth less than 50 cents.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s highest inflation was last estimated in July at 231 million per cent but is now believed to be much higher.</p>
<p>The central bank struggles to print money fast enough to keep pace with prices that rise several times in a day.</p>
<p>Due to currency shortages, cash can now only be withdrawn once a week from banks. Ordinary people can take out 500 million dollars a week while companies are permitted to withdraw 50 million dollars.</p>
<p>Winding queues in banks are commonplace in Zimbabwe as people take hours to withdraw money which is still not enough to see them through the day, while others sleep outside banks to get money the next day.</p>
<p>Once the region&rsquo;s breadbasket, the country is now battling widespread food shortages while cholera has killed nearly 800 people since late August, according to the United Nations.<br>

		<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right it&rsquo;s whitey&rsquo;s fault that those neanderthals have absolutely no concept of basic hygiene. Stupid is as stupid does. On a &#8220;lighter&#8221; note, maybe President For Life Mugabe can ease the crisis by inflating the currency so much that they can use those $500 Million notes to wipe their rears&hellip;</p>

This is very interesting.  How exactly did the British force the africans to defecate in public places and then step in it?  Did they use some form of mass hypnosis? Or is this just one of the White man&rsquo;s magic powers encompassed by &#8220;White priviledge&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Yep, That has to be it! British and American scientists are SO envious of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s cultural and economic success that they are working round-the-clock, trying to find more effective ways to unleash cholera on this pathetic population. </p>
<p>Why oh why does anyone in the West give this sorry bunch of greedy, self-destructive, ignorant, paranoid crybabies a cent? </p>
<p>All of Africa seems destined to forever remain in the Stone Age but Mugabe has done more to lower his country&rsquo;s standard of living in the shortest amount of time than just about any other African leader.</p>

		<p>Several years ago I would have scoffed at these accusations.  Not so anymore.  After seeing what both the U.S. and Britain have done and are doing to their native peoples, I wouldn&rsquo;t put anything past the elitists that run both dioctatorships.  Zimbabwe is nothing but Third World trash; but, isn&rsquo;t that what we&rsquo;re becoming?  Some of the media printed articles last week that the government expects either a nuclear or biological terror attack within the next five years.  Makes you wonder&hellip;.<br>

		<p>Perhaps the secret can now be revealed. 10,000 British commando units riding two-man midget submarines landed at night on the west coast of zimbabwe armed with picks and shovels to dig holes everywhere and pour cholera into the water supply. Meanwhile, 8,000 parachutists decended undetected on harare, cut the electricity supply and stripped all the supermarket shelves of food to deny the population sustenance. They also raided every hospital and clinic and destroyed all medical supplies. Well before dawn, every single British soldier escaped unseen and unscathed through the Channel Tunnel to be greeted in Kent by hundreds of flag waving volunteers handing out mugs of steaming tea. Next morning, when mugabe was informed, he declared that the entire colonial invasion was an utter failure as no-one in zimbabwe noticed any difference. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Could someone please get hold of one of these Zim $500,000&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, if anyone knows where to obtain them, please post the site, here.  Someone must have access to them.  Do we have any South African readers out there?  If so, here is a chance to make some money, selling Zim bills.</p>
<p>These bills would make great Christmas presents, and also look good in picture frames on the wall.  However the main reason I want them is for Third World travel.  When I&rsquo;m in the Third World, I always keep a large roll of large denomination bills in my pocket.  Usually I have a USA $20 bill on the outside, followed by some large denomination (but essentially worthless) bills from other countries, on the inside.  This large wad of money keeps muggers happy and keeps me alive.</p>
<p>If you know where to get Zim bills, please post at this web site.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

		<p>Remember when this country joined in the anti-Smith smearbund to run out those &#8220;racist&#8221; White Rhodesians and &#8220;give back&#8221; to the African hord the Rhodesian Nation that Smith and his predecessors created and ran so efficiently?

<p>And we would want to invade Zimbabwe, why exactly? We could cakewalk right in and steamroll the place if that were our goal, but all we&rsquo;d really get out of the deal might be a bad case of cholera.</p>
<p>As to GetBackJack&rsquo;s earlier post: I still scoff at these. accusations. While it may be true that the western governments do some awful stuff to their own people, there&rsquo;s still no sense in doing them to these people, when we can just sit back and watch them do it to themselves.</p>

Please don&rsquo;t compare the Africans with Neanderthals. Neanderthals had larger brains than modern man, and the circumstances surrounding their demise are unclear. They may have been absorbed into the European Genome; and perhaps this is the reason for Europeans&rsquo; creativity.</p>

		<p>   William   &mdash;  - ok, so the Neanderthals were absorbed into Europeans, we will assume that is true . Neanderthals had big, heavy bones . What other group today has big, heavy bones ? Sub-Saharan Africans . How does all of this tie in ? I&rsquo;m white and being related to Neanderthal doesn&rsquo;t bother me in the least (as long as it is true ). But if we are kin to the Neanderthal, then who the heck were the Cro-Magnons and where did they come from ? Were there black, white,red and yellow Cro-Magnons ? Neanderthals ?</p>

		<p> You don,t have to be a prophet to see there will be disease outbreaks if people a living in conditions like that. Did they also burn all the medical books? The whole world is getting pathetic. Bill Oreily said Prez Bush did more for Africa than most other people. We could use some of that money back for some of our problems. Auto bailout,Madoff bailout,bank bailout,etc. Hate to say it but we,re messing ourselves up royally also. Didn,t we see any of it about to happen? Well obviously not.</p>

		<p>  Watch the liberals agree with these ridiculous cholera accusations.  They believe anything blacks tell them.  <br>
    Look at Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted of murdering a white policeman.  He claims innocence.  When asked his version of events he said &#8220;I choose not to tell&#8221;. <br>
   White liberals still believe him.  Of course he chooses not to tell.  The only rational explanation of the facts is that he is guilty.</p>

		<p> Eventually,history will be rewritten to reflect all of this as the work of the evil white west.The story will be broadcast on every television, radio and mainstrem media website as being the gospel truth.Newspapers, magazines, history books and novels  will be  printed to show  the evil white people as being totally responsible for all the damage done. Movies will be made to show the carnage done by whites.<br>
 Of course whites will then be compelled by guilt to fix thier problems, take thier anger and abuse.<br>
 The question that keeps coming to my mind is this: How did we arrive at this sorry state?</p>
