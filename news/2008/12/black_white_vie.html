			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leonard Doyle, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, December  8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>America was a different country in 1995, when the most-watched murder trial of the 20th century saw an overwhelmingly black jury find O.J. Simpson not guilty of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman.</p>
<p>It seemed like delayed justice when the former footballer was sentenced to a minimum of nine years&rsquo; jail Friday for his role in an armed raid on a Las Vegas hotel room in 2007, during which two dealers were robbed of sports memorabilia.</p>
<p>There was none of the rancor that accompanied the murder acquittal or the civil trial, when a predominantly white jury found him liable for wrongful death.</p>
<p>This could be a hopeful sign that race relations are less poisonous these days. A little prematurely, some are even calling it a Barack Obama effect.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if many blacks still feel they are unfairly prosecuted and put upon by police, just because of their skin color, the general sentiment that the system is unjust may be diminishing.</p>
<p>Two years before Simpson&rsquo;s acquittal, an all-white jury acquitted Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney King, convincing many of the black population that the legal system was rigged. They showed their feelings with the Los Angeles race riots.</p>
<p>Friday&rsquo;s sentencing did not seem to stir any of the racial turmoil that so clouded Simpson&rsquo;s murder trial. {snip} Simpson&rsquo;s murder acquittal was supported by 62 percent of blacks, while only 20 percent of whites thought the jury had done the right thing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Simpson is now headed to jail where he will find himself in the company of a disproportionate number of black prisoners: 6.8 percent of black men are jailed compared with 1 percent of white men. White people commit lots of crime, but somehow they are not the ones most likely to end up in prison.<br>

		<p>Leonard Doyle seems to have difficulty understanding why prison populations are predominantly black.  How about a black crime rate roughly eight times than of whites and Hispanics combined?  Could that possibly account for it?</p>
<p>I suspect Doyle knows this full well but feels it his duty to appear puzzled by this altogether obvious fact.  Of course, I&rsquo;m sure his puzzlement doesn&rsquo;t extend to walking around in high-crime black neighborhoods to investigate the &#8220;root causes&#8221; of high black incarceration rates.</p>

<p>The criminal justice system has always been unjust. Whites who commit crimes are more likely to be caught and punished.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the matter of crime across the color line. Blacks choose white victims 53% of the time while white criminals victimize blacks 3% of the time. Blacks are many, many times more likely to commit inter-racial crime, 30 times more likely to assault, 100 times more likely to rob and 600 times more likely to rape whites, and yet they are only 2 to 3 times more likely to be charged with officially designated hate-crimes. How many of those are actually crimes against Asians or Hispanics is a good question.</p>

<p>What a disingenuous use of statistics.  Since there are approximately 5-6 times as many whites as blacks in the US population, if whites and blacks both commited about the same gross number of crimes, a 6.8:1 ratio is about what one would expect!</p>

		<p>I can remember what blacks, the majority of them, did after the 1995 acquittal of Slasher Simpson.They loved it. This time around, they dont care one way or another, because they know now, like they did then, that he really did do it.</p>

<p>There is still a black on white war going on right this minute and the election of a black has changed absolutely nothing. Having Obama in as pres doesn&rsquo;t mean blacks won&rsquo;t continue to fail, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean their test scores will increase and that they won&rsquo;t be whining that it&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault, and anybody who thinks differently just doesn&rsquo;t have a great deal of common sense, intelligence, and wisdom, especially street smarts.</p>
<p>This Leonard Doyle is just another left wing dreg who couldn&rsquo;t think in objective terms regarding race if his life depended on it.</p>

		<p>Many (or at least some) blacks believe in this new doctrine that  teaches them to view black on white crime as a legitimate social protest action (http://zi.ma/39112c). If nothing more, even if it is minimal - which I don&rsquo;t believe it is, the fact that this doctrine is being espoused is troubling. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an ugly little sleight of hand. They didn&rsquo;t compare white and black crime, but just said whites committed &#8220;lots&#8221; of it and &#8220;somehow&#8221; don&rsquo;t end up in prison. The implication is that justice is not evenly enforced and that whites benefit, even if the article presents 0.0% evidence to that end.</p>

		<p>Perhaps fewer black Americans view O. J. Simpson with any kind of sympathy now, as a result of some his antics since his first trial.</p>
<p>I would like to see the reporter try to justify, or document, his statement:<blockquote>&#8220;6.8 percent of black men are jailed compared with 1 percent of white men. White people commit lots of crime, but somehow they are not the ones most likely to end up in prison.&#8221;</blockquote></p>

<p>This sentence seems to undo the tone of the article overall.  It ends a hopeful set of comments about how Blacks are probably seeing themselves less as victims of a justice system rigged against them and then seeks to replant the notion with this one - and as far as I have read, fictitious statement.</p>

Blacks intentionally ignored this trial so it doesn&rsquo;t spoil their &#8220;We Won!&#8221; party on January 20th.  They&rsquo;ll ignore evidence that tests their faith in Magic President for as long as they can stand it.  Finding out Santa Clause is really Uncle Buck in cheap velvet is disappointing!  </p>
<p>Also, OJ is now getting quite long in the tooth and black victim-mongering culture tends to focus on younger people.  The Jena 6 look better on stage at the BET Awards then crusty old OJ.  </p>

<p>The author of the article, Mr. Doyle, notes, &#8220;White people commit lots of crime, but somehow they are not the ones most likely to end up in prison.&#8221;  Maybe Jared Taylor could send him a complementary copy of, &#8220;The Color of Crime&#8221;, and if Mr. Doyle is even remotely intellectually honest he can compose an apology, a retraction, and an article the thesis of the book.</p>

<p>Once again, an MSM writer shows himself to be totally clueless (or willfully ignorant). Things have not changed so much after all. In 1995 the goodly majority of whites thought OJ was guilty as sin, while the vast majority of blacks insisted he was innocent.  It looks like whites were right. In 2008, the majority of whites did <i>not</i> think Obama was the best choice for this country, while the vast majority of blacks insisted that he was. Who do you think will be proven right this time?</p>

		<p>Same old race hustling garbage.  Trying to compare whites, asians, blacks, mexicans, etc. is ludicrous.  Keep in mind that whites still outnumber all other demographicss by quite a margin so if you go by that ratio, the percentage becomes even more significant.  These bozos can rationalize, reason, justify, minimize all they want; the fact is that whites commit less crimes and that is why there are fewer whites in jail. Period. </p>

<p>Better hope white women never become enraged about the disproportionate rape of white women by feral black men. The female of any species is typically the more deadly, and if white women decide not to be victimized and raped in the thousands anymore, you are gonna have dead homeboys in the streets in biblical proportions!</p>

		<p>&#8220;The judge&rsquo;s sentence was extreme for the crime. This was nothing more than payback for the 1995 acquittal. White people are racist and vindictive. Period&#8221;.</p>
<p>Speaking for me, I really didn&rsquo;t pay attention to what OJ&rsquo;s latest escapade was. I was only jumping at the chance to spew my &#8216;hateful&rsquo; views. I suppose 10 years really is a long time, especially for the way this played out in the news up till now - as being something that was questionably a crime. You may be right. I really didn&rsquo;t pay attention. I notice the columnist didn&rsquo;t go in depth about it here either. He didn&rsquo;t compare OJ&rsquo;s sentence to that of other offenders with a similar record, or to other sentences given out by this same judge. </p>
<p>I do notice, however, when whites react to anything, say, &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, this ends up being &#8216;vindictive&rsquo; or evidence of hate. I suppose nowadays anyone who questions whether affirmative action might be a good idea or not, is a likely &#8216;white supremacist&rsquo;. Whites are taken advantage of, and anyone foolish enough to object is labeled a &#8216;hater.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just white and black. Any objection to the free for all is considered &#8216;hate&rsquo;. There are so many things no one is supposed to talk about. Smoking, everything. Bernard Goldberg once said, in the old days, &#8220;all you had to do was not be a communist&#8221;. At least according to Joe McCarthy. </p>
<p>Telling someone their fly is open is likely to be &#8216;offensive&rsquo; nowadays. I really think the attack on values, the attack on rules, and fair play, hurts everyone in society. It keeps us from being all we can be, despite our great technical proficiency, already built industrial society, and specifically for us Americans, the trade advantages we enjoy. It hurts all of us, but it may cause the most mischief in places &#8216;you people&rsquo; live. </p>

		<p>Many blacks are incapable of forming even the simplest of plans in order to attain a desired goal. Black culture is one of impulsive actions without the ability to determine the consequence of their actions. This is why among other things they make poor criminals and get caught almost every time. Now this certainly goes a long way to explain the disapportinate amount of blacks in prison. </p>

		<p>To Marcus:</p>
<p>Take a minute to reconsider your statement in light of the case presented by the state of Nevada: Testimony from co-conspirators; footage from the security cameras; use of a firearm in the commission of a felony&hellip;in terms of direct evidence, Simpson never had a chance.</p>
<p>Nine years for an armed robbery? With all the other included offenses? That&rsquo;s not payback, that&rsquo;s a gift.</p>
<p>As for 1995, there&rsquo;s a difference between acquittal and innocence in the minds of most people. The evidence against Simpson then was damning as well, but a cunning legal team capitalized on drastic procedural errors made by the police; the &#8220;Dream Team&#8221; lobbed a slow pitch over the plate to the &#8220;Dream Jury.&#8221; </p>
<p>As for your hamhanded claim that whites are vindictive, the poster &#8220;Exegesis&#8221; has, I think, said it the best. Blacks are lucky - incredibly lucky - that the majority of whites are such limp-wristed, sissified, brainwashed do-gooders, ready and willing to suffer all manner of degradation at the hands of blacks. </p>
<p>As for an image of what vindictive really looks like, watch a &#8220;sermon&#8221; from the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Jeremiah Wright.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The judge&rsquo;s sentence was extreme for the crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe this sentence was extreme. Maybe not. I just don&rsquo;t care. We&rsquo;re talking about OJ Simpson here. I care what happens to him about as much as blacks cared about what happened to Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman, i.e., not at all. The thought of &#8220;African-Americans,&#8221; of all people, lecturing us about Justice is laughable. Blacks don&rsquo;t care about &#8220;justice&#8221; unless it works to their benefit. Blacks proved in the Simpson case that they didn&rsquo;t care about Simpson&rsquo;s victims. They just didn&rsquo;t care. The only thing that mattered to them was race. Simpson was black. His victims were white. So screw his victims. They cheered when a mostly-black jury ignored the evidence and let him off. Do you think we weren&rsquo;t watching? We&rsquo;re not morons. We learn from experience. Blacks didn&rsquo;t think Simpson was innocent. They APPROVED of what he&rsquo;d done and they were literally dancing in the streets when he got away with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was nothing more than payback for the 1995 acquittal.&#8221;</p>
<p>If this was payback, it was a long time coming. Simpson deserved payback. He should have gotten his payback years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;White people are racist and vindictive. Period.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right. Simpson&rsquo;s a thug and a murderer  &mdash;  not a very bright one, either. He gets caught and you blame it on &#8220;white vindictiveness.&#8221; If you ask me, whites should be MORE racist and vindictive. Not less. If we were, maybe we wouldn&rsquo;t have so many cases like this.</p>

<p>Good points, Frank, but I&rsquo;ve been posting or reading this board for about three years now, and I have yet to see one single black contribute comments that are anything but unintelligent and irrational.  And not one of them has been able to think, reason, and logic, with any depth, so they ignore rebutting anything of a complicated or abstract nature, or they answer with thoughts that don&rsquo;t correctly address the issue, and we&rsquo;ve had university professors on here also.  (Mostly black studies.)  </p>
<p>You know, I truly believe that if Condoleeza Rice and Colin Powell tried to hold their own on here they couldn&rsquo;t do it, and they would eventually be revealed as people who display an inability to logic in coherent terms or they would respond often with points that were off base or didn&rsquo;t make sense or were in answer to issues other than those raised. </p>
<p>Before I came on this forum, I wasn&rsquo;t aware that black lack of intellectual ability was so low, and I write that as my honest, objective opinion and not for any desire to criticize them in any way.</p>
<p>Every single one of them who has been on the board accomplishes nothing but disruptions, and that includes the brightest.  Debating them is like wrestling jello, as one poster so aptly put it.  And what makes their posts more chaotic is that none of them regard himself/herself as anything but superior and is blinded by his/her own arrogance.</p>
<p>They have image problems alright, just as the liberals say, but they&rsquo;re based in ultra-egotism and not a lack of confidence. <br>

<p>What a disgusting and groundless implicit accusation to the effect that whites commit perhaps as much crime but get off while blacks are discriminated against in the judicial system. This lying Leonard Doyle probably knows that blacks commit a hugely disproportional amount of violent crime in all countries, esp. in the USA, with raping white women a evidently a popular sport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man. </p>
<p><b>What this means is that every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man. &rdquo;   Something going on here the MSM won&rsquo;t inform you about.</b></p>

<p>The cheering of blacks at the OJ acquittal was a wakeup call that most blacks are basically tribal adversaries of whites. Do you think they really thought that OJ was innocent? Ask yourself if they would have so cheered if his wife and her friend were black. IMO they mostly didn&rsquo;t care if he was guilty – it was a victory over whites, who are mostly hated as such.  <br>

		<p>This is one of the many articles that have come out since November 4th that have touted the election of Barack Obama as a giant leap for race relations and breaking down the stigma that Blacks are treated unfairly by our society.</p>
<p>While many (white) liberals may believe this and their hearts are in the right place, I think they will become more and more disenchanted with this line of thought as race relations do not improve soley because of the Obama Presidency.  </p>
<p>While White America will feel that now they can &#8220;move on&#8221; from our past, I am not sure that many Blacks are ready or willing to let go of the &#8220;victim&#8221; mentality.  Although an Obama Presidency surely makes the rest of America less sympathetic towards this attitude.  It will be interesting to see how Blacks react to this sentiment.  </p>

<p>&gt; According to the law in the state of Nevada, the sentence was standard for the items in Simpson&rsquo;s indictment.</p>
<p>But for many, including an increased number of Blacks, Simpson has got an awful lot coming to him.  Perhaps he will get some of it while in jail.  But as far as I am concerned, hell isn&rsquo;t hot enough for him.  Call that vindictive if you like.</p>

<p>Payback?!  Just what are you implying here, Marcus?  Are you trying to tell us that the jury who acquitted O.J. Simpson and all those good, honest, God-fearing, law-abiding black citizens who supported him DIDN&rsquo;T believe O.J. Simpson was innocent?!  That they never bought the idea Ron and Nicole were murdered by White Mormon crack dealers?!  That they never thought they were releasing a bereaved ex-husband who was going to spend the rest of his life hunting down Nicole&rsquo;s &ldquo;real killer&rdquo; and bring him to justice?!  That they were a bunch of White-hating racists who gleefully celebrated the release of a thug who butchered two innocent White people just to stick it to Whitey?!  Say it ain&rsquo;t so, Marcus.  I&rsquo;m shocked, I tell you, really shocked.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ll agree with you that the sentence was extreme &hellip; for a celebrity.  Had it been your average white Joe or black Jamal or mestizo Jesus, not at all.  </p>
<p>But has it ever occurred to you, Marcus, that your boy just screwed up?!  It was an election year, after all, and one of the candidates for POTUS was a black man.  It was not the year for old O.J. to play the Ace of Spades again and get away with it.  So, let that be a lesson to you and all the other brothas out there.  Peace.<br>

		<p>Sure, whites commit crimes, but blacks do so out of proportion to their percentage of the population. Respectable blacks are likely to be the targets of black thugs, so they should be (and probably often are) the first ones to speak out against crime.</p>
<p>Simpson&rsquo;s (white) attorney in the armed robbery case certainly sniveled about the all-white jury, but I bet he cheered O.J.&rsquo;s acquittal as much as all the racist blacks 13 yrs. ago. </p>

		<p>Marcus, I bet you were cheering the totally unjustified acquittal of this double murderer 13 yrs. ago. It is YOUR race that is racist and vindictive. Blacks made no secret of the fact that they were glad O.J. walked because of lynchings, never mind that whites have been lynched and Ron and Nicole had nothing to do with that issue anyway. </p>
<p>Incidentally, there are far too many whites who stand up for black thugs, so by your standards, they are the opposite of racist and vindictive. </p>
