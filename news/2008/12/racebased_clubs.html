<h1>Race-Based Clubs See Revival in Cuba</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liza Gross, Miami Herald, December 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Known in Spanish as sociedades de color, these and similar clubs fell victim to Fidel Castro&rsquo;s drive, shortly after he seized power, to eliminate any aspect of Cuban society that emphasized racial exclusivity. But their spirit and mission have been enjoying a renaissance over the past decade. And the same revolutionary government that once opposed them now seems to welcome their comeback.</p>
<p>In prerevolutionary Cuba, where blacks and poor, uneducated whites were denied access to good jobs and ritzy outings, the clubs served as centers to socialize and promote black racial progress. Many had libraries and offered night classes and sports instruction.</p>
<p>Above all, the sociedades sought to dispel any negative stereotypes of blacks.</p>
<p>Author and activist Carlos Moore says that members of Amantes del Progreso (Lovers of Progress), the club in his hometown of Lugareño, went as far as forbidding dances that they felt demeaned blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cuba boasted more than 200 Afro-Cuban sociedades in 1949. Most had inspirational names, like Fraternal Union, Progress or New Era.</p>
<p>Castro&rsquo;s revolution moved quickly to force integration, opening up private clubs and other facilities to all races and socioeconomic classes. It also dismantled the sociedades, both black and white, decreeing them obsolete in the new class-color-blind Cuba. Some survived into the first years of the revolution but were eventually disbanded.</p>
<p>LOSS OF AUTONOMY</p>
<p>While Afro-Cubans enjoyed unprecedented opportunities in education and social advancement after 1959, with the disappearance of the sociedades they lost &#8220;an autonomous position in Cuban society and politics, given that the revolutionary government took control of everything,&#8221; said Frank Guridy, who teaches history at the University of Texas.</p>
<p>The regime&rsquo;s actions not only deprived Afro-Cubans of a unique platform to air grievances but also erased a significant part of their heritage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to de la Fuente, the reputation of many sociedades had become tarnished because of their association with pre-Castro governments. The Club Atenas of Havana, for example, had built its headquarters on land given by President Ramón Machado, and some clubs had been close to the Batista regime.</p>
<p>Still, in 1959 and 1960, a group of black leaders defended sociedades &#8220;as the best form to advance their interests. But others said they had outlived their usefulness,&#8221; de la Fuente said.</p>
<p>Their abolition was a blow to Afro-Cubans because the sociedades &#8220;played an important role in keeping race in the middle of Cuban life,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With the sociedades closed, their records destroyed by the state or lost and many of their buildings repurposed, Afro-Cubans lacked an organized voice to dissent from the official position that the revolution had solved the country&rsquo;s racial problems.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s policy was to deny the existence of racism, arguing that communism&rsquo;s egalitarianism made discrimination based on race an impossibility. Any contrary opinion was considered counterrevolutionary and slanderous.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In reality, more than 1.2 million Afro-Cubans remained underrepresented in the circles of power and overrepresented among prisoners. They were also clustered in the more dilapidated sections of urban areas and continued to face discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p>The economic meltdown after the fall of the Soviet Union and a growing interest by Cubans in getting back in touch with their roots led to a resurgence of the sociedades. And not just for blacks. Groups for whites and Chinese are back, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>OPPOSITION TO RACISM</p>
<p>In 1998, a group of Afro-Cuban activists founded the Cofradía de la Negritud (Fraternity of Blackness).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fraternity&rsquo;s goal is to focus on the condition of Afro-Cubans because &#8220;the government has not managed to solve the race problem,&#8221; said Mesa Carbonell, an engineer.</p>
<p>The fraternity&rsquo;s manifesto includes calls to narrow the income gap between whites and blacks, to give more visibility to Afro-Cuban achievements, and to respect the rights of Afro-Cubans. It also tells black Cubans that advocating for progress should start with them.</p>
<p>Mesa Carbonell said the government first pressured him to give up his efforts.</p>
<p>But the fraternity persisted, and it now participates openly in government-sponsored events. Recently, Mesa Carbonell spoke at the ceremony to observe the 100th anniversary of the first black political party in Cuba.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mesa Carbonell said the sociedades were instrumental in fighting discrimination against Afro-Cubans and should not have been abolished.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the revolution had allowed them to continue operating,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we would have made more progress on the issue of race.&#8221;<br>

<p>Again, black Africans find themselves at the bottom of a society and - despite the fact that the society is as &#8220;egalitarian&#8221; as one can get, as a byproduct of Communism - it is <b>the society&rsquo;s fault</b>, not the <b>black&rsquo;s fault:<br>
One wonders at why the &#8220;racist&#8221; barrier to black achievement is almost never experienced by East Asian immigrants&hellip;</b></p>

		<p>How is something called the Afro-Cuban sociedades and the fraternity of blackness going to decrease segregation? Or is like in the USA, where all of these groups fighting for &#8216;integration&rsquo; are in reality simply promoting separation and exclusion - for themselves.</p>

<p>&gt; Yes indeed, that goes for the U.S. as well where Black Americans often have a malo Negritud.  (It is okay if you say it in Spanish!)  Of course, when rap &#8220;artistists&#8221; learn Spanish they will Americanize it to &#8220;Nigatood.&#8221;  But whites will not be able to write or say that word either.  I&rsquo;m just pointing this out as a cultural scout.</p>

		<p>The usual pro-black racism of the American media here but I did notice one interesting tidbit. Cuba now allows clubs for whites! </p>
<p>The USA doesn&rsquo;t allow this and we laughingly call ourselves &#8220;the land of the free.&#8221; But that ol&rsquo; Fidel is an evil dictator who denies freedom of association to his people.</p>
<p>Well, try starting a club for whites anywhere in the US (or Canada)and see the hectoring and intimidation you will face.</p>

		<p>Cuba has always been segregated along racial lines and had distinct territories where the different groups lived. Ask any Cuban over 50. Castro tried to force integration, but it never really took hold. In the history of Cuba, the majority of Cubans for the most part were Spaniards. Then you had the indigenous Indian population, and African former slaves. That at least, is what the Cubans I have known have told me.</p>

<p>As one who listens to black talk radio, I can tell you that elderly blacks who complain about segregation are the same ones who complain about the loss of black community. However, they never seem to make the connection between the &#8216;success&rsquo; of integration and the demise of black communities.</p>

<p>For fifty years the tribes have been integrated in Cuba, yet none of them want to see themselves as a multiculral society of &#8220;Cubans,&#8221; but prefer to break away into racial/ethnic enclaves and concern themselves with whatever is a part of their group identities.</p>
<p>Can there be a greater example of the failure of multiculturalism than this?  People of different races and ethnicities do not want to integrate together in a big society, but would rather be with their own kind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a perfectly normal instinct.  The only people who can&rsquo;t see this are those who are so enamoured with the thought of a rainbow culture they actually suffer from some kind of mental aberration.</p>

		<p>     You mean Cuba is not the racial utopia that every leftist around the world thinks it is? The problem I always run into when speaking with a socialist/communist/revolutionary types, is their steadfast belief that state action and legislation will solve every social and economic problem in the world. They seem to believe: &#8220;if we just let the communists take over we won&rsquo;t have any racism, sexism, religious intolerance, poverty, police brutality, teenage pregnancy, bad weather, etc, etc. </p>
<p>This story out of the Miami Herald should be no surprise to anyone with a general idea of human history. </p>

		<p>Let me get this straight. Blacks want ethnically based clubs in Cuba yet seem to get irritated by whites having their own clubs. That is just like blacks the world over. Somehow I don&rsquo;t see white Cubans (the few I knew had outright hatred for anything African) being plagued by white guilt like the Anglos to the norte.</p>

		<p>This story evokes some interesting memories&hellip; of Fidel Castro and his entourage visiting New York in 1961, I believe. Castro&rsquo;s visit being to address the United Nations. The Cubans settled into a then fairly pricey hotel. Promptly trashing it! They also plucked chickens, dumping the feathers into toilets (clogging the plumbing, of course). Urinated and defecated in the hallways. The Cubans, believe it&hellip; COOKED the chickens over fires started in metal trash cans. Then after doing an incredible amount of damage to the hotel, they screamed they were mistreated as hotel guests, and left for a Black hotel in Harlem. </p>

That was the famous  Theresa Hotel in Harlem. Castro stayed there as a ploy to express solidarity with American blacks (and try to win their support). I was among the crowds gathered outside  to get a glimpse of him. (I didn&rsquo;t.) I don&rsquo;t know about the whole truth of those stories (we know how the media can lie when they want to smear someone), but they were at least basically true. The Theresa has long since been turned into a coop apartment building now, I believe. </p>
<p>The Theresa was also, a few years later, the same place where Martin Luther King was stabbed in one of the rooms by a prostitute (with a letter opener). He went staggering into the 28th Precinct, down the block, with the letter opener still in his chest.  That was before he became really famous, and  it didn&rsquo;t get any media attention.</p>

It should be remembered that Castro was the child of a mulatto.  That would explain his lack of a clear identity and his determination to force everyone else together (just as he was).  </p>
<p>Castro was Cuba&rsquo;s Obama.</p>

		<p>How ironic.  The Castro revolution effectively destroyed a previously prosperous agricultural society, caused a massive exodus of its upper classes (there are now more real Cubans (i.e. Whites) living in the United States than there are in Cuba) and converted the place into a Marxian-socialist &#8220;paradise.&#8221;.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, blacks are still at the bottom of the proverbial socio-economic ladder there.  Why am I not surprised?</p>

<p>Thank you. You could very well be right, and my memory of the exact details could be a bit off. But I have to wonder if yours is the &#8220;cleaned up&#8221; version of the story that was let out to the public, changing the locale from an illicit tryst in a hotel room to a book-signing event by a notable personage. And the prostitute was changedd to a &#8220;deranged woman&#8221;.  It was told to me by an elderly cop who was on duty at the 28th Precinct station house (just down the block) at the time of the incident, when King came staggering in (the letter opener was still in his chest).  I retold the story as best I can recall it; but of course that was a long time ago and memories can fade. </p>

		<p>&#8220;It should be remembered that Castro was the child of a mulatto.&#8221;</p>
<p>Castro&rsquo;s Father was a White Spanish man.  He came to Cuba during the Cuban revolution.  He was in the Spanish army sent to  put down the revolution.  After the revolution he remained in Cuba.</p>
<p>He soon became rich which led to Castro&rsquo;s advantages of going to university and law school where he became a communist.  Castro&rsquo;s Mother was not Castro sr&rsquo;s wife.  Castro&rsquo;s Mother was one of Castro sr&rsquo;s other women.  I don&rsquo;t think she had any African blood.  In the numerous biographies there are many pictures of Castro when he was young before he grew the beard.  He shows no sign of African blood in lips, nose, or shape of his head and facial structure.</p>
<p>In Mexico the &#8220;other women&#8221; are often Indian or part Indian.  But in Cuba the &#8220;other women&#8221; were usually white women whose parents could not afford the debutante parties and large dowries need to snag a prosperous middle class husband. This was especially so back in 1900 when Castro sr decided to stay  in Cuba.</p>
<p>Being woman #2 or #3 of a rich man was often a much better deal financially than being the wife of an ordinary lower middle class man.  Usually the &#8220;other women&#8221; or mistresses entered into a contractual relationship with the rich man that ensured a comfortable life for them and their children and a pension when they got old.</p>
<p>A friend was married to a Cuban who left Cuba in the first wave of exiles in the 1960&rsquo;s.  He was related to Castro&rsquo;s Mother.  I believe his Father was Castro&rsquo;s Mother&rsquo;s cousin.  My friend&rsquo;s husband and his family sure looked completely white to me.</p>

		<p>The major reason Castro and all other dictators closed down the racial clubs and fraternities is that dictators don&rsquo;t want any other organizations to exist.  </p>
<p>The major problem is that even the most innocent and innocuous clubs can become breeding grounds of discontented people to get together.  First they complain, then they plot, then they foment a revolution. The American, French, Russian, Chinese and almost all revolutions are fomented and plotted out of organizations of the discontented, often the discontented elite.</p>
<p> The early Castro regime really cracked down on gays as well as racial clubs for the same reason. He didn&rsquo;t want any organizations not run by the state.</p>
<p>Hitler abolished the Christian programs for children and teens. He substituted his own Hitler Youth. Cromwell forbade any sort of gatherings. The Soviet Union sponsored every sort of club and organization as long as it was run by communist watch dogs. Thsi prevented the organization of private organizations.</p>
<p>Allowing the clubs to re-open is a sign that the regime is weakening.</p>

Posted by 10:06 AM </p>
<p>The story told in all the Lives of Saint MLK is that he lay on the floor of the store until the ambulance came.  The story I read is that he was stabbed in a Woolworth&rsquo;s where he had been shopping.  Supposedly the deranged woman grabbed a knife in the kitchenware section.</p>
<p>But if the cop remembers Saint MLK staggering into the police station with a letter opener in his chest the Therasa hotel and prostitute may well be the true story.</p>
<p>Most of the biographies of palagarist Michael King are falsehoods.<br>
Given what we know about his numerous infidelities, the prostitute story makes sense.</p>
<p>But the truth about MLK will never be known except to Hoover and the FBI men of the time.</p>
