<h1><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/17/AR2008121701319.html">Report Finds Some Federal Judges Put Off Swearing-in New Citizens</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Spencer S. Hsu, Washington Post, December 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal judges in some parts of the United States are delaying the swearing-in of new citizens, apparently so that courts can keep millions of dollars in naturalization fees paid by immigrants, according to a new government report and immigration analysts.</p>
<p>In one of the nation&rsquo;s busiest courts, a judge&rsquo;s delay caused nearly 2,000 people to not receive the oath in time to register for November&rsquo;s general election, according to the ombudsman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Michael Dougherty, in a 13-page report posted on his office&rsquo;s internet site yesterday.</p>
<p>The conclusion adds a new twist to longstanding complaints that applicants for citizenship face long waits, poor service and different treatment from U.S. immigration authorities depending on which office handles their application. While USCIS has made big gains in clearing massive backlogs since summer 2007, including working with the FBI to speed up security background checks, the new report cites a new bottleneck.</p>
<p>While generally &#8220;federal courts are very responsive&#8221; to USCIS requests for naturalization ceremonies, Dougherty reported &#8220;that court officials denied USCIS the opportunity to naturalize persons in time to vote in the recent general elections&#8221; and &#8220;otherwise engaged in conduct inconsistent with the letter or the spirit&#8221; of the nation&rsquo;s immigration law.</p>
<p>In the most dramatic case, the report stated that immigration officials asked a U.S. district judge this summer to schedule more ceremonies or to allow the agency to administer the oath itself to new citizens itself, but was denied.</p>
<p>A USCIS district director was told the court already had &#8220;done more than its share&#8221; in swearing-in new citizens, Dougherty&rsquo;s office reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ombudsman report noted without elaboration that courts receive $14.09 per oath administered, and that USCIS allocated $8.7 million last year for this purpose. But the report added that USCIS officials &#8220;are very reliant on the cooperation of court officials&#8221; to meet naturalization goals, citing their &#8220;substantial power&#8221; and &#8220;a lack of parity&#8221; with immigration officials.</p>
<p>Prakash Khatri, who was Dougherty&rsquo;s predecessor until earlier this year, said fee revenue is an incentive for judges to perform oath ceremonies themselves instead of allowing the agency to handle them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This fall, the agency reported naturalizing more than 1 million citizens, with about 475,000 applications pending for more than nine months, 192,000 more than 18 months, and 118,000 more than two years, Dougherty reported. USCIS said the average processing time as of October was 8.8 months and set a goal of five months by next October.<br>

		<p>The economy keeps getting seriously worse, yet the lemmings keep coming in droves.</p>
<p>It appears we&rsquo;re getting the dumbest of the world&rsquo;s people, something that is sure to put the finishing touches on a nation that is facing 25 to 35% unemployment in the next year or so.</p>
<p>But I imagine they carry their signs with them at the swearing ceremonies that say, &#8220;Immigrants face racism.  We need jobs too.&#8221;  And into the closet it goes with the others.</p>

		<p>The act of illegal immigration should be made a crime of terrorism and prosecuted as such.</p>
<p>In the meantime, all immigration should be completely stopped until all illegals are rounded up and deported. Around the clock efforts should be made by all branches of law enforcement until this goal is accomplished.</p>
<p>Consider how many scores of illegals are identified during regular traffic stops and released back into the stream. It happens routinely.</p>
<p>Everyone should have to prove citizenship. Everyone! If you buy a home, car, rent an apartment, buy groceries, go to the hospital, doctor, library, grocery store&hellip; anywhere, anything&hellip; citizenship should be CONFIRMED. If the police stop you, you should have to prove you are a citizen. If someone cannot prove citizenship, he should be immediately processed and deported. All money, materials, bank accounts, and property in the person&rsquo;s possession on U.S. soil should be confiscated and put into a U.S. fund to augment more deportations. BTW, when the person is deported, he should be given a stiff warning that if he returns again, he will be sent to a place like Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and imprisoned indefinitely. Force him to sign a document acknowledging that he understands and collect a positive DNA sample for fture monitoring. Let him know he has been recorded and will be monitored. Periodically pay some of the deportees an extra visit abroad in the future to remind them that they are being monitored. Word will spread.</p>
<p>U.S. Citizens who know of illegals and fail to report the illegals should face very heavy fines and some jail time. Employers who hire illegals should be imprisoned for a very long time, stipped of their businesses, and all of their property should be sold at auction to help fund more deportations.</p>
<p>The federal authorities should set up all along the Mexican border and start by verifying the citizenship of all people of color in all of the counties on our side of the border from Texas to California. </p>
<p>Once all of the undesirables are cleaned out from those counties, begin resettling homeless White families, located elsewhere in the U.S., to the former homes and businesses of the illegals who were deported. Help them to clean the places up and plant the U.S. flag there again. Employee the new White owners in the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to protect our border. Arm and train them to shoot to kill on sight when an undesirable slips crosses the border into their town! Advertise this tactic in the media.</p>
<p>After the border counties are secured and Whites live there again, move the process to the suburbs of large cities and work inward toward the urban areas. Hopefully, after learning what transpired in the border counties, many will have already fled back to Mexico, Columbia, and the other places that undesirables flock from.</p>
<p>Seriously, my friends. Enough is damned-well enough.</p>
<p>Finding and deporting all illegal immigrants is not an impossible task, even if there are tens of millions of them.</p>
<p>In the meantime, do your part in any way that you can. Report suspected illegals to your local sheriff. Do not hire Blacks and Browns to do your yard labor. Instead, employ the use of local White kids. Do not frequent establishments that cater to the affirmative action crowd. Go to small, White owned stores that hire White people. It may be a little more expensive, but do not subsidize places like Wal-mart and the other stores who push their faux-celebration of diversity into your face. Call around and let large businesses know that you will not be shopping at their stores because you suspect they have hired illegals. Let them know you are watching and reporting their crimes to ICE. Followup and do so!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give in.</p>
