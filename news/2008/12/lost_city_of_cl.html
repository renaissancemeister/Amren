			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeremy McDermott, London Telegraph, December 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The settlement covers some 12 acres and is perched on a mountainside in the remote Jamalca district of Utcubamba province in the northern jungles of Peru&rsquo;s Amazon.</p>
<p>The buildings found on the Pachallama peak are in remarkably good condition, estimated to be over 1,000 years old and comprised of the traditional round stone houses built by the Chachapoya, the &lsquo;Cloud Forest People&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The area is completely overgrown with the jungle now covering much of the settlement but explorers found the walls of the buildings and rock paintings on a cliff face.</p>
<p>The remote nature of the site appears to have protected the site from looters as archaeologists found ceramics and undisturbed burial sites.</p>
<p>Archaeologist Benedicto Pérez Goicochea said: &#8220;The citadel is perched on the edge of an abyss.</p>
<p>&#8220;We suspect that the ancient inhabitants used this as a lookout point from where they could spot potential enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ruins were initially discovered by local people hacking through the jungle. They were drawn to the place due to the sound of a waterfall.</p>
<p>The local people &#8220;armed with machetes opened a path that arrived at the place where they saw a beautiful panorama, full of flowers and fauna, as well as a waterfall, some 500 metres high,&#8221; said the mayor of Jamalca, Ricardo Cabrera Bravo.</p>
<p>Initial studies have found similarities between the new discovery and the Cloud Peoples&rsquo; super fortress of Kulep, also in Utcubamba province, which is older and more extensive that the Inca Citadel of Machu Picchu, but has not been fully explored or restored.</p>
<p>Little is known about the Chachapoya, except that they had been beaten into submission by the mighty Incas in 1475.</p>
<p>When in 1535 the Spanish Conquistadores arrived in Peru, they found willing allies in the Cloud People for their fight against the Incas.</p>
<p>Spanish texts from the era describe the Cloud People as ferocious fighters who mummified their dead.</p>
<p>They were eventually wiped out by small pox and other diseases brought by the Europeans.</p>
<p>The women of the Chachapoya were much prized by the Incas as they were tall and fair skinned. The Chronicler Pedro Cieza de León offers wrote of the Chachapoyas.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are the whitest and most handsome of all the people that I have seen in Indies, and their wives were so beautiful that because of their gentleness, many of them deserved to be the Incas&rsquo; wives and to also be taken to the Sun Temple.&#8221;<br>

<p>Another lie by anti white racist liberals.  Small pox did not exist in Europe until about 1510.  Small pox, like syphllis was brought back to Europe by the early explorers.  Here is the proof:</p>
<p>(1) Medical forensic; small pox affects the bones.  Persons who die of small pox have noticable lesions in their bones.  Europeans practiced burial, not cremation.  Europeans had small graveyards.  So every 100 years or so cemetery keepers dug up all the old bones and piled them in basement caverns.  Forensic sciencts and physicians have observed millions of bones belonging to thousands of Europeans.  Not one smallpox lesion has been discovered that could be dated before 1500.</p>
<p>(2)Medical epidemology. Small pox first appeared in Europe around 1510. Physicians and public health authorities knew it was not measles or chicken pox or any other disease presenting with a rash. It was blatantly, obviously a new disease. It was a virulent disease, often killing its patients in a few days.  No one seemed to have immunity.  Almost everyone exposed succumbed to it.  This is characteristic of a disease newly introduced  into a population.</p>
<p>(3) No bones of native Americans have been discovered showing small pox lesions.  But very few skeletons and bones of native Americans have been found, especially compared to the hundreds of millions of European bones preserved in the ossuaries.<br>
Smallpox lesions have been discovered in an American animal cerca 1300 AD.  Scientists have discovered the bones of a bear living in central Mexico around 1300 AD.  The bones of the bear bear easily identifable small pox lesions. S</p>
<p>Smallpox therefore existed in Mexico cerca 1300AD wheras no evidence of smallpox has been found in Europe before 1500.</p>
<p>Another day, another liberal anti White racist mantra endlessly repeated by the liberal media.  </p>

		<p>Have you heard the Legend of Viracocha? Ancient Peruvians believed that in the beginning, Lord Viracocha, prince and creator of all things, emerged from the void and created the earth and the heavens. This legend is similar to the legends of Kukulcan (Mayas) and Quetzalcoatl (Aztecs). This god was described as being a bearded man with white skin and beautiful emerald eyes.<br>
That is the reason why Aztecs and Incas were confused when the Spanish conquistadors arrived to America. They first thought Viracocha/Quetzalcoatl was coming back.</p>

		<p>What can be said about the hunting down of white cultures the world over for cneturies. Whites are the global minority and yet have developed the most advanced prosperous countries/cultures. No matter where whites build towns/cultures/ prosperity for themselves they are chased down by racial thieves to destroy what we build and like locust tear it all apart and move on to the next white site for consumption! <br>
Chasing/hunting white people has become the brown sport!     V</p>

		<p> There are some fantastic accounts given by the Spanish historians . Unfortunately, it is all being covered up by political correctness . Any theories on where they came from ? Perhaps those provinces in India containing the fairer complected people ? Maybe even Europe ? Interesting subject .  </p>

		<p>Recent scientific paper about smallpox phylogeny and hypotheses about its possible spread:<br>

<p>Apparently, the virus came to Europe and Africa from the East Asia. The Americas got it twice - once a local, less deadly variant &#8220;alastrim&#8221; in South America evolved, the second entry was that of the European more deadly variant. Interestingly, the Indian population in Ecuador didn&rsquo;t diminish under Spanish rule, probably due to sort of &#8220;vaccination&#8221; by the resident alastrim virus. </p>

		<p>They were &#8220;ferocious fighters&#8221;, but also  noted for their gentleness! Blah, blah.  Sure!  The whitest and most beautiful, but also all exterminated now - by the white man&rsquo;s diseases of course. Right!   This story is loaded with starry-eyed mythology.  Sheer nonsense.</p>

		<p>Just google Kennewick Man, and you&rsquo;ll see how desperately and ruthlessly almost everyone in a position of authority (including &#8216;academics&rsquo;) is trying to prevent the truth from getting out. </p>
<p> The TRUTH is that waves of Caucasoids have been arriving in the Americas for thousands of years.  If that truth were ever recognized, the dispossession of whites here would be harder to sell.  Not that anyone but whites cares about facts&hellip;.. but then, again, most of the current impetus for our dispossession comes from within.  We have to be persuaded to give our world away.</p>

<p>Your are getting your diseases mixed up. Syphilis was called the great pox as opposed to smallpox. But you are right about syphilis. It arrived in Italy, not Spain, in 1496.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first recorded smallpox epidemic was in 1350 BC during the Egyptian-Hittite war. Smallpox reached Europe between the 5th and 7th centuries and was present in major European cities by the 18th century. &#8220;<br>

<p>Most of our major disease came out of Asia where mankind had a long history of contact with large animals. </p>
<p>If anyone is interested I suggest you read &#8220;Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies &#8221; by Jared Diamond. <br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393061310/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1228505968&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393061310/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1228505968&sr;=8-1</a><br>
He explains why diseases generally travel from advanced societies to primitive societies and not the other way around. <br>

<p>I discovered this 23 years ago while in medical school.  It was mentioned briefly in class that there was no bone lesion evidence in European skeletons.  Our med school library was huge.  I read a lot of non class books about the history of medicine and came across both the smallpox lesion bear bones and the fact that European physicians and public health authorities of 1500 had no doubt that smallpox was a new disease in Europe.</p>
<p>1500 Europe did not have modern medicine, but because of the empidemics and plagues, it had excellent public health services and records.  Unfortunately, they could not cure the diseases but only record them and try to attempt their spreading through quarrantine.<br>

		<p>      Read Arthur Kemp&rsquo;s &#8220;March of the Titans&#8221; for information<br>
about lost White Cultures. The Spanish found a tall red haired<br>
race in the Canary Islands-which they wiped out. According to<br>
local legend, there was a tall, red haired race which once ruled<br>
Easter Island. They were wiped out in a race war except for one<br>
who was the husband of the chief&rsquo;s daughter. Always the same <br>
story-a small Nordic minority rules a sullen dark race until <br>
overthrown or absorbed. We have to start doing something dif-<br>
ferent.</p>

		<p>I think the Canarians were absorbed and assimilated by the Spanish&hellip; most of the men were killed in the war, and the women got married off to the Spaniards. As for the Chachapoya, there were chroniclers at the time claiming that the &#8220;Spaniards married the blonde Inca princesses in large numbers&#8221;. Whites still make up 15% of Peru&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Perhaps the disappearance took a different form&hellip;</p>

		<p>There is a lot of mystery in the history of the white race. In ancient times, Caucasians lived not only in Europe but also in Asia (Iran, Afghanistan, India and China). What happened to them? They were exterminated by the Mongols or mixed with other Asian peoples.</p>
