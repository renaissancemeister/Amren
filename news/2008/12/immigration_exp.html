			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Ludden, All Things Considered (NPR), December 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the Obama administration takes shape, many experts are betting it will significantly curtail one of the most visible and controversial facets of the Bush administration&rsquo;s immigration crackdown: the high-profile workplace raids in which federal agents arrest dozens, even hundreds, of undocumented workers.</p>
<p>The number of people arrested in such raids has risen tenfold in the past five years, to 6,287 in 2008. Most have been administrative arrests. The biggest raids have made national news, but on any given week, there have been smaller ones across the country. They&rsquo;ve targeted a San Francisco Bay Area chain of taquerias, Rhode Island courthouses and a Virginia painting company, to name a few.</p>
<p>As a candidate, Sen. Barack Obama questioned the effectiveness of such tactics in a 2007 interview with The Des Moines Register.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the election, immigrant advocacy groups and Democratic members of Congress have intensified their calls for a moratorium on immigration raids, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has talked of finding a way to end them. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) says the undocumented workers being arrested and deported have millions of family members who are legal residents or U.S. citizens, and he says the effect has been devastating.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Bush administration actually spent years pushing to legalize undocumented workers. But when a broad immigration overhaul failed in Congress two years in a row, Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff dramatically ramped up worksite raids, along with other get-tough measures. In recent months, a number of studies have shown a big drop in illegal migration, and while Chertoff admits the tanking economy played a big role, he credits his agency&rsquo;s crackdown as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meissner [Doris Meissner, ormer head of the INS] does not believe President-elect Obama will end worksite raids altogether, but she does foresee a shift in focus to employers, and a far broader approach to holding them accountable. Meissner says basic labor law enforcement has languished for years. She expects an Obama administration to devote more resources to protecting wage and safety standards. She also says leveling the playing field in that manner would go a long way toward weeding out undocumented workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security has aggressively encouraged businesses to consult a federal database to check workers&rsquo; legal status. It&rsquo;s a program called E-Verify, which DHS promotes in a number of ways, including funding credits on NPR. Soon, DHS also will require large federal contractors to use the program. Mark Krikorian says that could mean up to 20 percent of all new hires in the country will be checked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the other hand, critics complain this program&rsquo;s error rate is too high, and some groups want to scrap it as well. {snip}<br>

		<p>If the economy keeps falling, which it will, there won&rsquo;t be many work places acailable for anybody to work at.</p>
<p>And I can guarantee that any illegals holding jobs will have citizen ire directed at them in such an intense way as to create some serious turmoil.</p>
<p>White people WILL rise up and loudly protest injustices if it&rsquo;s apparent they&rsquo;re not able to feed their families because of foreign labor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll guarantee it, so whether the black deceiver backs off of work place enforcement won&rsquo;t matter much any way.</p>
<p>Too, he just might change his attitude if he&rsquo;s forced to send the military to put down a few skirmishes. </p>

		<p>I actually agree with Obama on this one!</p>
<p>Cracking down on greedy employers who hire illegals will have more impact than randomly scooping up a few unfortunate paisonos who will only be replaced by more illegals the next day.  Once some gringo employers start going to jail, the rest will suddenly decide saving a few bucks on wages ain&rsquo;t worth it.  </p>
<p>Enforcing minimum wage &amp; workplace safety laws will take away a lot of the incentive for hiring illegals.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it.  As long as there are good jobs in the US for illegals, they&rsquo;ll find a way here.  When the jobs dry up, the illegals will stay home.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not holding my breath that the new administration will start witholding social service, free healtchare, free education, etc&hellip;.</p>

		<p>No, Obama will hardly make any effort to secure our borders or crack down on illegal immigration. We hear on the news that a half-million American jobs were lost last month. Yet our crooked mealy-mouthed politicians see nothing wrong with allowing another million and a half more illegal immigrants to slither over the border every year.</p>
<p>Something to think about. Not ALL the illegals grab the bottom most jobs. Some of the somewhat smarter ones will be competing with Americans for the available jobs. And their damned anchor babies will do their best to crowd our children and grandchildren out of the available jobs down the road.</p>

		<p>The solution to the current immigration problem is deceptively simple: no menial labor, no immigration.  If employers were held to federal regulations as they now exist, there would be dramatic drop in immigration from third world countries.  Immigrants who cannot find work through legal means will eventually pack it in and return to their native villages.  Those who stay on as wards of the state can easily be identified and deported.  The catch is: will the federal authorities pressure employers to vet their work force???  We have an AMERICAN problem not a foreign problem.</p>

		<p>Many, many blacks who voted for Obama may well be sorry when their low skill jobs are taken by the immigrants Obama will surely bring in. Blacks thought their lives would be wonderful once Obama was president. They will surely have a rude awakeing. Obama, although he favors that side, is only half black and has absolutely no connection or understanding of the problems and lifes of American blacks throughout American history. It seems likely Obama may well be the worst president blacks in this country have ever had. Of course he will surely be the worst president whites have ever had too. </p>

		<p>Just a couple of quick responses to the article and the comments:</p>
<p>Paul (8:02 pm) is correct in pointing out that enforcement against employers of illegals will have more effect than, as he says &#8220;randomly scooping up a few unfortunate paisonos.&#8221; Those business owners who cynically and knowingly employ illegals (Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, I meant &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221;), should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, such as it might be (soon to be changed under the benign regime of BHO, I&rsquo;m sure). If there are fewer employment opportunities for illegals, there will be fewer of them here. So much is simple common sense. Along with eliminating the illegal aliens&rsquo; (excuse me, &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221;) access to the various &#8220;welfare&#8221; programs, this is what I believe is known as &#8220;de-magnetization.&#8221; Such a policy could be expected to work as an almost magical &#8220;self-deportation&#8221; program (especially in a slumping economy). However, we can expect the BHO Administration to act in the opposite direction, with less enforcement and more &#8220;welfare&#8221; programs for illegals (excuse me, &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221;).</p>
<p>However, Fed Up at 8:12 pm really begins to put his finger on the root of the problem when he speaks of anchor babies. The anchor baby phenomenon, along with chain migration, made possible by Teddy Kennedy&rsquo;s 1965 Immigration Act, is really the source of most of our immigration problems. The anchor baby problem, along with the idiotic concept of &#8220;family reunification&#8221; (why can&rsquo;t their families be reunited in their native land?)is where the attack against our current feckless immigration policies needs to start. The reform could move on from there, but the stupid and dangerous concept that a geographical accident of birth should automatically convey citizenship for life needs to be attacked first, followed immediately by the &#8220;family reunification&#8221; scam.</p>
<p>Of course, given the policies of our current Demopublican regimes (the one going out and the one coming in), all of the above is wishful thinking.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of &#8220;conspiracy theories&#8221;, but I&rsquo;m beginning to think that the only reason Chertoff did anything about illegal immigration was to provide the Left with enough ammunition (sob stories) to put an end to them and welcome our brown-skinned brothers and sisters out of the &#8220;shadows&#8221; and into our economy  &mdash;  I mean  &mdash;  country.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Immigration &#8220;experts&#8221; predict fewer workplace raids?&#8221;</p>
<p>Who the hell are these immigration experts?</p>
<p>What do they mean they &#8220;predict&#8221; fewer workplace raids?</p>
<p>What do they know that in an open society, the citizenry shouldn&rsquo;t know? </p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t immigration policy based on existing immigration law, when &#8220;prediction&#8221; would have nothing to do with it?</p>
<p>Prediction is a phenomenon associated with chance, randomness,etc. Someone is violating existing immigration laws, if we have to &#8220;predict&#8221; whether those laws will be carried out or not.</p>
<p>All of these questions highlight the absolute, lawlessness, elitism, direlction of duty, and plain treason that is demonstrated by our elected officials every single day, yet 94 percent of them were re-elected.  The band of traitors in our government play on.</p>

		<p>Actually, be glad all the workplace raids may stop. Because what has been happening is in small middle-American towns where, for instance, meat-packing plants employing many Mexican illegals have been raided, and the Mexican illegals deported, they have quickly been replaced by LEGAL sub-Sahara black African Muslim Somali and such brought in by the thousands, mostly under the bogus &#8220;refugee&#8221; program whereby the U.S. is taking in 75% of black Africa&rsquo;s &#8220;refugees&#8221; who then sponsor yet more in an unending exponentially increasing flood. And they have huge families, 6 or more children per female. They swamp the public schools and social welfare agencies and criminal justice system. A burden that these small low income white middle-American communities must then support. In addition to being on the receiving end of crime and violence and strife at a level the likes of which their once peaceful communities never knew.<br>
The residents of those towns, once they get a taste of the black Somali Muslims, wish to GOD they had the Mexican illegals back, with a new found appreciation. You see, the Somali and their ilk, who in addition to all the same social &amp; racial pathologies you see in the U.S. inner cities, (crime, social dependency, racial demands), bring a culture ripe with the Islamic terrorist threat. Remember these are the folks who were dragging the mutilated naked bodies of our soldiers through their streets after we&rsquo;d gone in there to try to save them from mass starvation. These are the folks engaging in rampant piracy off the African coast. These are the folks from the land where there is no government but daily extreme violence and social chaos and terrorism. Somalia is the way it is because of the people and their culture that lives there. Just like most of sub-Sahara Africa. And they don&rsquo;t change just because our government at our expense plops them down in our neighborhoods. No, it just brings Somalia and sub-Sahara Africa to OUR streets.<br>
At least the Mexican illegals come here to WORK. Share our European origin culture. Speak a European language. Are Christian. And are compatible with our society and our values. And are our immediate neighbors.<br>

		<p>  George Bush on ABC said his biggest regret was not passing &#8220;shamnasty&#8221; for &#8220;undocumented&#8221; workers. Bush commented that he wanted America to be a &#8220;welcoming&#8221; society.  In other words, he wanted us to welcome illegal aliens who hold our laws in contempt. Barak Obama&rsquo;s views are identical to Bush on this critical issue.  Pay a living wage and Americans will take any job, particularly these days. </p>

		<p>Olabama won`t enforce the border. If he did and was successful he would need to bring the Mexicans back anyway because his trash supporters want a job but don`t want to work.<br>
     Anybody who ever worked blacks with Mexicans learned right away that the Mexicans do all the work and even fix all the goof ups and screw ups the blacks did intentionally or unitentionally.<br>
     Your grand father and fathers teach you how to work.70% of all black males have no fathers or grand fathers to teach them anything except the bus schedule to the joint. New Orleans had to import 75,000 Mexicans while 75,000 black males under 30 sat on their culos in Atlanta and Houston smoking crack, side hustling or playing the down low game.<br>

		<p>No matter what, there will be increasing pressure for the Federal Government to start using E-Verify.  The technology is ready and the bugs have for the most part been worked out.  Better yet, the public is becomming increasingly aware that it exists.  The mainstream media is culpable insofar as they do not report on this they way the should.  Prop 202 in Arizona being a case in point.  </p>
<p>The worst thing that could happen to the pro-illegal side is if we made this mandatory.  The crooked employers would lose their workforce and the political leverage for amnesty would collapse once it became know that there are things we can do to change (remove) illegals and for that matter control legal immigration. </p>
<p>My guess is that Obama will duck this issue as it grows in the public eye.  Whether or not he likes it, E-Verify will be taken up by more and more States, Cities, and various business and it will build it&rsquo;s own constituency irespective of whether he gives it attention or not.     </p>

		<p>Going after the employers is best, but don&rsquo;t look for Janet Napolitano to do much of anything, least of all arrest employers for engaging in illegal alien activity.</p>
<p>The border will be wide open.  We&rsquo;ve lost that one too, as well as the amnesty scheme.</p>
<p>The only thing we can hope for is for the economy to crash as soon as possible so that if amnesty is invoked there won&rsquo;t be any jobs for them and they&rsquo;ll have to go home, followed by tax revolts, food riots, and eventually armed racial conflicts.</p>

		<p>Those raids are &#8220;controversial&#8221; only because the media hypes them as such.  I&rsquo;m sure at least 80% of American citizens favor them.  A far higher percentage of Americans opposes abortion than favors illegal immigration, but you&rsquo;d never know it from the mass media.</p>

Bush, McCain, and other &#8220;we need cheap labor&#8221; Republicans keep thinking they can buy the Hispanic vote with an illegal alien amnesty.  In reality they&rsquo;ll make the Republicans a permanent minority party.  At least the Democrats know what they&rsquo;re doing   &mdash;   replacing the white population with people of sufficiently low IQ to vote for them.<br>
