			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Bingham, Telegraph (London), December 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Alun Elder-Brown, a recruitment executive, said he was left feeling &#8220;like a piece of dirt&#8221; after being barred from bringing the animal into Kirthon Restaurant in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on religious grounds.</p>
<p>The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association said the decision was illegal under the Disability Discrimination Act and Mr Elder-Brown, 51, is now considering suing the establishment in The Pantiles.</p>
<p>It follows a series of successful prosecutions of Muslim taxi drivers who refused to carry guide dogs in their cars because they considered them unclean on religious grounds.</p>
<p>Mr Elder-Brown was taking his girlfriend out to celebrate her birthday with her five year-old daughter last week when he was told he would have to leave his dog, Finn, tied up outside.</p>
<p>He showed a card issued by the Institute of Environmental Health Officers certifying he and his dog were allowed into any premises but an argument ensued and the owners threatened to call the police if he did not leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was humiliating and degrading, especially as there were a lot of people around me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was made to feel like a piece of dirt. They told me I couldn&rsquo;t come in because it was against their religious beliefs to have a dog in the restaurant.</p>
<p>&#8220;They then said I could leave Finn tied up outside. I stayed calm but when they threatened to call police I left.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;It was horrible. It put a dampener on the whole celebration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the Disability Discrimination Act it is illegal to refuse to serve a disabled person of give them a diminished level of service because of their disability.</p>
<p>Chris Dyson of Guide Dogs for the Blind said: &#8220;We are extremely concerned and disappointed that Alun was refused access to this restaurant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We very much hope that this restaurant will reconsider its decision and get in touch with the charity so that we can give them a better understanding of their requirements under the law and explain the important role that the guide dog plays for Alun.&#8221;</p>
<p>The restaurant&rsquo;s owner, Amenur Abdussamad, was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>But Shamin Ahmed, a partner in the restaurant, said that he had written to Guide Dogs for the Blind to apologise for the incident.</p>
<p>He said that although the owners of the venue are Muslim, he insisted religion was not a factor in the decision to refuse Mr Elder-Brown.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were worried about the hygiene, that is what happened, it was a mistake,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had a letter from Guide Dogs for the Blind, I have sent a reply apologising about that &nbsp; &hellip; we found out afterwards that guide dogs are allowed, I didn&rsquo;t know that.&#8221;<br>

		<p>It is tragic that we can only use the privileges meted out to a disabled group of citizens to defend ourselves against the cultural depredations of another. So far as I can see, despite the hyperbolic claims regarding ritual ablutions there is certainly no reason to believe Muslims have any claims to superior hygiene. In fact, some of their attire worn at odd times in terms of weather, suggests the opposite. A good many of their eating outlets are closed because of poor hygiene and food storing practises. On the other hand, guide dogs are very well-behaved. </p>
<p>But of course, the argument is not about cleanliness, but of a culture that most British people are either indifferent to, or opposed to entering the country, but which the government happily assists in allowing it to supplant the established culture, traditions and values, the only valid basis for British law. Hopefully, the terms British Muslim will be recognised by the legislators as an internal contradiction. There can never truly be such a beast as a British Muslim.</p>

		<p>I think there&rsquo;s a forgotten individual in all of this. That poor poor dog who had to experience this terrible case of discrimination. I can&rsquo;t believe that in this day and age, there are still segregated restauraunts. When will people learn that dogs are people too? I just hope that this incident hasn&rsquo;t damaged the poor creatures psyche too bad. I think an immideate dose of K-9 Affirmative Action is in order. We need to bring these souls out into the open, so they can share in the vast wealth the West has to offer.</p>

		<p>The sad point is that no one else in te restaurant had the courage to support the blind man.  I would have without thinking and even called the police to censure the restaurant owner.   It his their duty to know the laws and I have know this one for many years.  It is a common sense one.     &#8220;Offende Muslims&#8221; can go back to where the Islamic laws apply if they do not like those that have beenn developed in the West for Western conditions.  They have a choice.</p>

		<p>Dogs are the most wonderful and useful animals on earth. They help the blind, guard the home, help the police, sniff out drugs and provide companship for the lonely, among dozens of useful chores. What a foul and twisted creature Mohammed must have been to condemn them. Muslims and their religion are the scourge of the earth. Aren&rsquo;some of our lousy legislators who allow them here women? Don&rsquo;t these women know how muslims treat other women? Now with Obama we&rsquo;ll surely see more of these lowly creatures in our country because Obama may well be a muslim himself or at least admire the faith of his old man. We admit people who truth be know, despite us. Madness that can only originate in Washington. </p>

		<p>Why not have spare ribs, ham, roast suckling pig, and other pork products on the menu and keep the Muslims out of the restaurant!</p>
<p>I have traveled extensively throughout Europe. I would really hate to see such wonderful countries as Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Austria, and the Scandinavian countries fall under Islam.</p>
<p>It was absolutley obscene to refuse to let this blind man bring his necessary dog into the restuarant.  This makes it clear that Muslims not only hate Christians, Jews, Atheists, Hindus, and other non-Muslim &#8220;infidels&#8221;, but Muslims also have no compassion for the disabled, and cannot be decent enough to make an exception for a blind man! </p>
<p>Anyway, think of what the world will lose if the Muslims succeed in taking over Europe.  No more Louvre Museum, Mona Lisa and other great works of art.  No more Sistine Chapel, Westminster Abbey, German beer, Belgian beer, Oktoberfest, excellent wines, extensive nude beaches with beautiful naked women, London Theatre, French cuisine, Italian cuisine, and other wonders Europe has to offer the world!  </p>
<p>The European nations did nothing to stop Adolph Hitler until it was too late to prevent WW11 and the atrocities of the Third Reich.  Unfortunately, most of Europe is not taking notice of the ever-increasing wave of prolific, invading Muslims.<br>
Unfortunately, it will most likely be too late, if the European nations ever wake to the danger of the Muslim invasion!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid the &#8220;Mouse&#8221; missed the point. The dog in question is not a pet it&rsquo;s a working animal. A guide dog is the eyes of it&rsquo;s vision impaired owner. Perhaps in muslim countries blind people are shunned and left alone to scratch in the dirt for their subsistance, but in Britain and other civilized countries, blind people are encouraged to lead productive and rewarding lives with the assistance of guide dogs, canes, braile and other helpful technologies.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s kinda funny that they are worried about hygine.  Human saliva is actually several times more toxic than that of a dog. You have more of a chance of getting a terrible infection from being bit in a fight by a human than a dog, or sickness from sharing poorly cleaned utensils or eating undercooked/contaminated food in a restaurant.  Heck, I&rsquo;d be more afraid to shake a potentially unwashed hand in a restaurant than to pet someones helper dog!  </p>
<p>Helper dogs are highly trained so I really can&rsquo;t imagine one either taking a dump in the middle of the place, or biting/licking someone uninvited.  The guy says its not about religion, but that&rsquo;s a joke!  It&rsquo;s certainly not about the actual medical/bacterial threats one can face in a restaurant.</p>

No, I didn&rsquo;t miss the point and that is why I said what I said. A dog is a dog even if it is service dog that belongs to a blind person. I didn&rsquo;t say the blind person shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to eat in the restaurant. I said his dog (an <b>ANIMAL</b>) should not be allowed in the restaurant. I really can&rsquo;t think of anything much more disgusting than having to share my dinner time with a strange dog adjacent to my table (even if it is a <i>service</i> dog). Your assertion that a blind person would be reduced to &#8220;scratching in the dirt&#8221; if his service dog was not allowed into the restaurant is rediculous.<br>

		<p>Those intolerant Muslims need to take themselves back to the sand dunes from whence they sprang. This way, they&rsquo;d avoid being offended by the customs and culture of their adopted country they so despise. </p>
<p>Look for a backlash down the road when the West has had enough and put a moratoreum on any further immigration from Muslim countries.</p>

   You may not have noticed Mouse but the people, the real people of this country, adore dogs. I could think of something far worse than &#8220;sharing my dinner time with a dog&#8221; but no, in this country i&rsquo;d better keep my mouth shut</p>

<p>Overall, I would say it is to late for any country in europe and probably to late for the U.S. too since I no longer believe that, as a country, we have the courage to throw out the invaders. I guess it is fortunate that all of the WWII American vets will soon be passed on and will not have to see what so many died and suffered to preserve being thrown away to the muslims.</p>

		<p>If this had happened in the US, the fellow would have had grounds to sue the restaurant into penury under the Americans With Disabilities Act, which makes it expressly illegal to discriminate against the handicapped.  If Britain has a similar law, I only hope Mr. Elder-Brown is contacting a good lawyer.</p>

I really don&rsquo;t want to drag this out but I can&rsquo;t let this non-sense go unchallenged. You can be sure you are dealing with one of the Animal Faithful when they drag out the standard animal zealot propaganda line of&hellip; &#8220;Dogs mouths are cleaner than human mouths&#8221;. Uh, well, no they are NOT. This erroneous statement is based on a severally flawed epidemiological study done many, many years ago. There is absolutely no scientific basis for your claim. The fact is, a dog&rsquo;s mouth is extremely filthy. Dogs harbor lots of staph bacteria in their mouths. I have yet to find a dog that does not lick its anus. Often the dog will lick its anus shortly after deficating. Many dogs will eat other dogs feces. Do you still want to stand by your statement that a dog&rsquo;s mouth is &#8220;cleaner&#8221; than a human&rsquo;s mouth. Yes, I&rsquo;m sure you do. You are, after all, one of the Animal Faithful.<br>

Such reasoning is spurious. One has nothing to do with the onther. This is just flawed reasoning and logic.<br>

		<p>      My dog ate his feces on occasion. I didn&rsquo;t stop loving him<br>
but I wouldn&rsquo;t touch noses with him right after he did it. In<br>
general though, we don&rsquo;t share alot of diseases with dogs however<br>
dirty their mouths might be. A bite by a monkey or human is  much<br>
