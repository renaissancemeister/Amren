			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Macintyre, Times of London, December 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The President-elect&rsquo;s writings seem to be coloured by his grandfather&rsquo;s brutal treatment at the hands of the colonists</p>
<p>More than half a century ago an African was arrested by Kenya&rsquo;s colonial police; he was imprisoned, tortured, and finally released two years later, a broken man. Such episodes were grimly common during the Mau Mau rebellion against British rule in Kenya, yet this sharp little shard of history has now poked above the surface again, as the story of Barack Obama&rsquo;s grandfather.</p>
<p>This is more than simply another fascinating element in Mr Obama&rsquo;s already colourful story. No president of modern times is so steeped in history, both America&rsquo;s history and his own family narrative. The past, and where he came from &mdash; Hawaii, Indonesia, Kenya, Chicago &mdash; is how Mr Obama has chosen to define himself to the American electorate.</p>
<p>But the story of his grandfather&rsquo;s treatment at the hands of the British illustrates how little we, as a country, yet know about Mr Obama&rsquo;s view of Britain, and the extent to which those attitudes are likely to be filtered through the prism of the past.</p>
<p>Recent presidents have come to office wearing the special relationship on their sleeves. George W. Bush&rsquo;s Anglophilia was of a familiar Republican sort, based on the belief, inherited from a father who had fought alongside the British in the war, that when the chips are down only one ally can be firmly relied on. Churchill&rsquo;s bust stared out from the corner of the Oval Office. When I interviewed Mr Bush, he spoke for ten, eloquent minutes about the beauty of the Scottish landscape.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton&rsquo;s affection for Britain was equally profound, though less emotional, reinforced by his time as a Rhodes scholar in Oxford. He could speak the language of Third Way Blairism without a trace of an accent. When Ronald Reagan told Parliament in 1982 that he felt &#8220;a moment of kinship and homecoming in these hallowed halls&#8221;, he spoke for most postwar presidents, and most Americans.</p>
<p>Mr Obama&rsquo;s relationship with Britain will also be special, but perhaps not in the ways we have come to expect. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve been through two world wars together,&#8221; he said, on his brief visit to Britain last July &mdash; the required historical mantra. That heritage, however, may be less personally relevant than another war fought in the jungles of Kenya, in which Britain was not an ally of Mr Obama&rsquo;s family, but an enemy.</p>
<p>The experience of a grandfather he never knew, long before he was born, will not provoke some knee-jerk anti-British attitude on the part of the new president. Mr Obama is too supple a politician for that. Yet international relationships are based on emotions as well as politics, and the set of preconceptions about Britain that Mr Obama brings to the White House will be far removed from those we have become used to over the Past half-century.</p>
<p>Mr Obama&rsquo;s diplomatic remarks about Britain have been pallid and tactful; it is the more unguarded corners of his writing that offer revealing flickers of another attitude. In his memoir Dreams from My Father Obama devotes just six words to describing his first visit to Britain: &#8220;I took tea by the Thames.&#8221; The British passengers on the plane wear &#8220;ill-fitting blazers&#8221;; the one sitting next to him, an acne-ridden Mancunian, he finds aggravatingly superior, referring to the &#8220;Godforsaken countries&#8221; of Africa.</p>
<p>On safari in Kenya, he talks to an English doctor with &#8220;pasty blond hair&#8221; who has quit Britain to live in Africa. &#8220;England seems terribly cramped,&#8221; the man says. &#8220;The British have so much more, but seem to enjoy it less.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are small indications, but together they begin to form a caricature: Britain ill-dressed, pasty-faced and racially arrogant, cramped, spotty and joyless. In one of the most revealing passages, Mr Obama describes how travelling in Europe makes him feel &#8220;edgy, defensive, hesitant&#8221;. &#8220;It wasn&rsquo;t that Europe wasn&rsquo;t beautiful,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;It just wasn&rsquo;t mine.&#8221; So far from coming home to Britain, like Reagan, Mr Obama has described just how far from home he feels here.</p>
<p>Later, in Kenya, riding the imperial-era railway, he imagines &#8220;some nameless British officer&#8221;, puffed with colonial hubris: &#8220;Would he have felt a sense of triumph, a confidence that the guiding light of Western civilisation had finally penetrated the African darkness?&#8221; He squirms at the African waiters&rsquo; cringing attitude towards whites in the Nairobi hotels, and mocks the tourists pretending to be characters in some imagined re-creation of Out of Africa.</p>
<p>The discovery that Mr Obama&rsquo;s grandfather was active in opposing colonial rule, and brutally treated as a consequence, will only increase the future president&rsquo;s cachet among black Americans. One of the few criticisms of Mr Obama in the black community was, that as an African American, as distinct from an African-American, he did not share the same racial historical scars. Yet here is evidence that his ancestor fought for racial justice, and bore the scars for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Mr Obama&rsquo;s different historical legacy will not mean a change of foreign policy, but it may well presage a change of tone &mdash; on Guant√°namo as well as Britain. For British diplomats, reading President Obama will require a new vocabulary, and understanding a different sort of history. Not the glory of shared victory over evil in the Second World War, but the more complicated history of decolonisation, in which Britain&rsquo;s role was sometimes less than glorious and both sides committed horrific atrocities.</p>
<p>Mr Obama has written movingly about how his African past has defined him; that past, still emerging, may also help to define the future of the Anglo-American relationship.</p>
<p>When he hears an English accent, I suspect, the new president will not automatically think of Churchill, Benny Hill or Princess Diana, but rather of some nameless British colonial officer, gazing out on an Africa he believed he owned: for that is where Obama is coming from.<br>

		<p>No one really knows who Obama&rsquo;s paternal grandfather is.  He may very well be the father of American black communist Frank Marshall Davis, close family friend of the Dunahm&rsquo;s and mentor of the young Obama.</p>
<p>This sounds like the kind of self hating blather the anti white, anti British media has been parroting from their communist masters for years. &#8220;Obama, like all blacks all over the world has the right to hate us because of our racist sins against blacks and other non whites.&#8221;  &#8220;We are evil because we are white europeans with our evil christian heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, the people who should hate Britian the most are the unfortunate White Americans who have suffered for 400 years from the fact that Britian allowed blacks into America during colonial days.</p>
<p>The mau-mau by the way, was not so much an anti British underground movement as it was a movement by the majority kikiyu tribe of Kenya to eliminate luo, masai and other tribes from the anti colonialst movement.</p>
<p>The object of course was to make sure that when the British left the kikiyu would rule Kenya.  The kikiyu mau mau movement was very successful.  It did eliminate the opposition and has ruled kenya ever since.</p>
<p>Mau mau killed about 500 whites and about 10,000 luo, masai and other native Kenyan tribes people.</p>
<p>And as far as those nasty white people Obama met during his european and african travels, most of his book is false.  He probably made them up.</p>
<p>I recently read on another website that Chicago Tribune writers who travelled to Indonesia and Hawaii to interview people who had known Obama as a child and teen were told an entirely different story about the way Obama was treated because of his race than Obama lies about in his book.</p>
<p>According to Indonesian neighbors, &#8220;Obama was teased and harassed more than any other kid in the neighborhood because of his unusual appearance.  One time 3 bigger kids jumped him and threw him into the swamp.  Luckily he could swim.&#8221;  &#8220;He was called names because of his appearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hawaiian classmates and neighbors related that contrary to his book, Obama was a very popular, well treated boy in Hawaii.  His classmates could not recall any of the so called racist incidents Obama claims to have suffered growing up in Hawaii.</p>
<p>There were probably many  reasons why Ann Dunham Obama Soreto sent Barack home to her grandparents in Hawaii.  Bad treatment of Barack by Indonesians because of his race may have been one of those reasons.</p>

<p><br>
How on earth can this writer claim to KNOW this? Has he specifically ASKED Pres-elect Obama whether his attitude toward the British will be knee-jerk or not? Nobody KNOWS this yet   &mdash;   possibly not even Obama himself. Times editors used to enforce rules against such sloppiness. Or is this just the &#8220;spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down&#8221; that journos feel the need to include when writing anything the least bit critical of America&rsquo;s real-life Emperor Jones? You know: the point in the article where they HAVE to say something nice about him to prove they&rsquo;re not &#8220;racist.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t claim to KNOW what&rsquo;s in Obama&rsquo;s mind regarding Britain or any other subject. But I can conjecture that, based on the plethora of predictable black leftist anti-British venom and, yes, RACISM quoted from Obama&rsquo;s books, it looks to me as if the incoming Messiah&rsquo;s attitude toward the British will be VERY MUCH one of knee-jerk hostility. </p>
<p>Face it, Brits: this guy doesn&rsquo;t like you. He doesn&rsquo;t wish you well. In any confrontation between UK and any other country, count on Pres. Hussein siding against you. </p>
<p>In fact, The Times   &mdash;   and everybody else in the UK, for that matter   &mdash;   had better start getting used to the idea that the man sitting in the White House is not a friend to their country but an ENEMY. </p>
<p>Welcome to the club, guv&rsquo;nor.</p>

This was the charter of the land,<br>
And guardian angels sung this strain:<br>
&#8220;Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:<br>

<p>The nations, not so blest as thee,<br>

While thou shalt flourish great and free,<br>
The dread and envy of them all.<br>
&#8220;Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:<br>
&#8220;Britons never will be slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thee haughty tyrants ne&rsquo;er shall tame:<br>
All their attempts to bend thee down,<br>
Will but arouse thy generous flame;<br>
But work their woe, and thy renown.<br>
&#8220;Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:<br>
&#8220;Britons never will be slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Muses, still with freedom found,<br>
Shall to thy happy coast repair;<br>
Blest Isle! With matchless beauty crown&rsquo;d,<br>
And manly hearts to guard the fair.<br>
&#8220;Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:<br>

		<p>Obama, naturally, will not come close to considering how, without British, Belgian, Dutch, and German Whites, Africa would still be a primitive land of stone-age people.  When Whites first arrived, there was never so much as a hut more than one story high on the entire sub-Saharan continent.</p>
<p>Obama will also never consider that without the colonialists, all of Africa would still be mired in rank supersition and barbarism.  Of course, after colonialism, they&rsquo;re now reverting back to their ancient, savage ways.   </p>
<p>As boxer Muhammed Ali once said after his first visit to Africa, and this, on the record, &#8220;I thank God my ancestors got on that boat!&#8221;</p>
<p>Never, ever, think that a liberal will consider any kind of positiveness out of any historical record unless it forments hatred, resentment and chaos. They focuse on any negative that will give themselves a following among the shallow, ignorant, and corrupt. And never forget that simple gratitude is not allowed among leftists along with intellectual honesty. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t feel slighted by obama (small case intended), Britain.  An affirmative action, leftist-raised, intellectual lightweight is assessing you from a very sophomoric point of view.  </p>

		<p>So, Obama possesses an ill concealed hatred of Europe, Europeans, and things European. This means, of course, that the Leftist chattering class across Europe, especially in London and environs, will love this guy even more. You can just see them, can&rsquo;t you, pleading and begging for him to walk all over their countries and their fellow Europeans.</p>

		<p>Is Obama anti-British? If he is its surely an awkward one for blank slate, non-racists to justify.</p>
<p>His father was nothing more than a sperm donor, he played no part in Obama&rsquo;s upbringing. And, since race doesnt exist and culture/nurture are everything, Obama&rsquo;s anti-Britishness should be no more pronounced than someone of Icelandic or Korean or Tibetan descent raised in the US.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s sad that deep down Obama doesn&rsquo;t like White people, when it was the White side of his family that raised him and sent him to private schools, while the Black side abandoned him.  So why does he dislike White people?  It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>As for Obama harboring resentment towards the Brits because of his Kenyan grandfather, the Brits need not worry.  Obama&rsquo;s handlers, the ones who took him from obscurity and presented him to Americans as presidential material, will not let him do anything radical (such as estranging us from a loyal ally) without their approval.  </p>
<p>In addition, leaders of bankrupt countries don&rsquo;t play major roles in world affairs, and our country is in DEEP financial trouble.  Beggars can&rsquo;t be bossy!</p>

		<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the British, big Obama (little Obama would never have been conceived), would probably have eked out a life hering goats whilst wearing nothing but a blanket draped over himself, going around shoeless (not to mention watchless, car-less and TV-less)in a rural African idyll, carrying a shepherd&rsquo;s crook under the hot African sun, and retiring at the end of the day to his cosy little wattle and daub hut, for a good night&rsquo;s sleep (the lions and hyenas being kept at bay)once the sun had set.<br>
 A simple life and perhaps a better life.</p>

		<p>This arrogant patronising mulato has one big chip on his shoulder. This is a man displaying an obvious inferiority complex. A man who, by his own admission,  feels contempt and hostility towards the British and &ldquo;edgy, defensive, hesitant&rdquo; around Europeans. Great Presidential material.  I clearly remember he was grinning broadly and waving enthusiastically to the crowd when he was last in Europe. We have many idiots in Britain and Europe who cheered for Obama. The same type were delighted to see Mugabe take power. They are just as clueless about this man and his split personality. I don&rsquo;t believe for one moment, his inherent hostility towards Europeans is restricted to those still living in Europe but extends to those he is to preside over in America, and presumably those still remaining in Africa.</p>
<p>His Mugabe-like personality, personal issues and thinly veiled antagonism towards Europeans may well result in the US-European relationship being reduced to that we enjoy with Zimbabwe. Ironically Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) and Kenya would be far better off under British rule. Unfortunately because of Soviet and US pressure that wasn&rsquo;t possible. Most of us would be more joyful if his kind would vacate the countries where they seem to feel so unhappy, unloved and  unwelcome, and return to the loving arms of their brothers and sisters in the motherland. Unfortunately the traffic is, for now, in the other direction.</p>

		<p>Check out the people he despises.</p>
<p>The British, and Europeans in general have dragged the world out of the dark ages. A previous post was correct in saying that without our &#8220;colonialism&#8221; they would be in the Stone Age&#8221; - no medicine, heathcare, technology, laws, etc.</p>
<p>He was also correct in saying that they are now reverting back to the Stone Age, their natural state. Look at Zimbabwe, Congo, Rwanda, Gambia, Liberia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan&hellip;&hellip;..the list goes on. Even South Africa is going down the pan as whites leave in thousands.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We have many idiots in Britain and Europe who cheered for Obama.&#8221; Alexei</p>
<p>  If there was any dissent from the unseemly adulation of President Obama in Great Britain, we didn&rsquo;t see it on the controlled media here in the United States.  Of course, our media concentrated on London and ignored the rest of the country. Was it relief at getting rid of George Bush or real enthusiasm for Obama?  His attitude toward the UK, as depicted in the article, is anything but complimentary.  </p>

		<p>Mau mau killed about 500 whites and about 10,000 luo, masai and other native Kenyan tribes people.</p>
<p>The Mau Mau didn&rsquo;t do so well against the WHITE organized mercenaries of Mike Hoare in the Congo.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the British, big Obama (little Obama would never have been conceived), would probably have eked out a life hering goats&#8221;</p>
<p>If it wer&rsquo;nt for the Arabs, Obama Sr wouldn&rsquo;t even have had goats to herd.</p>

		<p>A lot of gulf Arabs, Saudis&rsquo; Kuwaiti&rsquo;s are treated at the hospital where I work.  I never see the patients, but I do see their numerous bodyguards.  So I have become pretty familiar with various Arab types.</p>
<p>I asked some Saudi bodyguards which royal billionaire they were with. They of course denied they were with a Saudi royal and claimed they were Lebanese with an ordinary Lebanese businessman.  They were friendly and flirting.  So I told them that they didn&rsquo;t look like any Lebanese I ever saw and that they were too tall to be Kuwaiti&rsquo;s and I was sure they were Saudi&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They never told me which Saudi royal they were with, but they did admit that they were Saudis.  They were surprised that I could distinguish various Arab types.</p>
<p>From seeing all those pictures of Obama, he looks to me very, very Arab. </p>

		<p>Obama would consider anyone who doesn&rsquo;t treat him as Christ returned to be, &#8220;arrogant and joyless&#8221;. He&rsquo;s the first pure celebrity we&rsquo;ve ever elected President. His qualification? Being black. Other than that he&rsquo;s indistinguishable from any other liberal day-dream believer. I mean, this guy can say ANYTHING and people will treat it like gospel. I&rsquo;m sick of the media fawning over his every move because they no-doubt encourage him. If you treat a jerk like the &#8220;Messiah&#8221;, he&rsquo;ll act like one. The anti-Obama folks in Europe need to speak up just as we need to speak up here in America to confront this epidemic stupidity. As a white man proud of every drop of European blood flowing through his veins I saw this: Obama, you&rsquo;re a blatant coward. If you were ever forced to mount an honest, public defense of your beliefs and policies they would be utterly discredited. But honest debate is not your style. You hide behind the Liberal media and the establishment it represents and its support insures you need never be honest. You&rsquo;ll never be my president, just a White House squatter.</p>

		<p>Speaking as an Englishman I really don&rsquo;t give a damn what Obama does or does not think about my country.In fact I&rsquo;ll be relieved if I never again hear this patronizing nonsense of the &#8220;special relationship&#8221;.If it exists at all it should be confined to the realms of kinship and culture, not politics. </p>

		<p>Britain, I am one American who loves you and I&rsquo;m not the only one.  We admire your great writers, your culture, your scientific discoveries, and your enormous contributions to world civilization.  Far more Americans feel affection toward you than those who don&rsquo;t, and you can count on us when the chips are down.</p>

		<p>Sadly so many (and particularly young) Britons are infatuated with Barack Obama, a situation which the media and politicians are onlt too pleased to encourage and feed on. I only hope this is a temporary situation and the shine rubs off sooner, rather than later. I fear for my country if this sleepwalk into our own destruction carries on much longer.</p>

		<p>Reading up further on the Luo tribe, it appears that originally they were a Nilotic people whom migrated south from Sudan.<br>
 Originally they were in the habit of walking around in a state of perfect nudity - which of course marks them down as a pagan and non-muslim people.<br>
 Idi Amin, the former Ugandan leader was a devout muslim however.In the 1960s and 70s  some Nilotic tribes in Uganda persisted in the naked habit (it is churlish of me to mention the famous prodigious &#8216;endowment&rsquo; of many Nilotic males), this not only caused Amin much embarrassment, but a a muslim he found it an especial anathema - to the point that he waged a war on the tribesmen in order to force them to wear trousers.<br>
 I can assure you this story isn&rsquo;t a joke.</p>

		<p>Europeans have always been jealous of Americans and now that an emasculated black president has been foisted upon America the Europeans are ecstatic.  They rightly consider this travesty to be the ultimate debasement of the office of the president and it makes America the laughing stock of the world&hellip;</p>
