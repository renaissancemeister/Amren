<h1>Affirmative Action Will Be Swept Aside to Address Skills Shortage: Mantashe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Nxumalo, SABC (South African Broadcasting Corporation) News, December 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Affirmative action and employment equity policies will not be allowed to stand in the way of municipalities and local authorities hard hit by skills shortages, the African National Congress (ANC) said after meeting the leadership of The Afrikaans Handelsintitut (AHI).</p>
<p>The ANC said there were at least 70 municipal authorities in the country without a single engineer or artisan. &#8220;South Africa is running so short of skills that affirmative action cannot realistically be considered an issue, &#8220;Gwede Mantashe, the general secretary of the African National Congress said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Important statistics show that unless we produce at least 2400 a year we are not going to cope with the skills shortages in the country&#8221;. Mantashe said compounding the skills crisis in South Africa today was that the country was saddled with a rapidly ageing artisan population with an average age of 54 years and practically no decent national programmes of training younger people are in place.</p>
<p>Mantashe said the main purpose of meeting the AHI was to build both an inclusive South African society and a national vision of where the country was to go rather than an ANC vision of South Africa. AHI President Venete Klein said her organisation had a broad range of hard skills that could contribute directly in alleviating the skills and business management crisis in most municipalities in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have got a lot of skills that could add a lot of value in the areas of housing, healthcare, finance and many other critical areas,&#8221; Klein said. &#8220;If we join hands and work together, success will to the benefit of all South Africa&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Not even mentioned is the fact that ALL of the skilled labor, no matter what it is, is done almost exclusively by whites because the average black there has an IQ similar to a low grade moron.  Only a tiny handful of blacks can funtion in a skilled position&hellip;.and their inherit personality traits make them so unreliable that it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if they understand how to do their job or not.</p>
<p>South Africa is getting a very clear wake up call as to its fate without whites, as thousands flee the massive death happening in zimbabwe.  What is happening in zimbabwe is has only one cause and it is very specific&hellip;..all the whites are gone so now, no one has what is needed to maintain civilization.  So civilization is disintergrating and a goodly amount of the population is dying horribly as a direct result.</p>
<p>My best guess is that, without whites, upwards of 90% of zimbabwe&rsquo;s population will eventually die off.  Without modern means (or perhaps it would be more honest to say, without WHITE means) the land, culture and institutions can only support a fraction of the population there&hellip;and not well, at that.</p>
<p>It really is as simple as that.  SA might be figuring this out.  If so, they are a hell of alot more wise than the zimbabweans.</p>
<p>It might not matter though.  Whites in SA are seeing what is going on.  As many as can, are fleeing africa.  They don&rsquo;t want what happened in zimbabwe to happen to them.</p>

<p>Admitting that affirmative action is essentially a form of welfare, that, in spite of what its proponents claim, does not lead to quality.  I get the sense that the Chinese are going to fill this void.</p>

		<p>I heard their national airline had to lease several new jets to India because they did not have enough mechanics or pilots due to AA insanity.  Rumours also about having their landing permissions revoked in both europe and the US for maintenance issues.</p>

What&rsquo;s going to happen is skilled whites will be allowed to come in and do equipment maintenance for a short time while being required to train blacks.</p>
<p>When whites have things running again, they will be politely thanked and told to leave.  </p>
<p>Of course, the training the whites give blacks will be useless because blacks lack the nuance of sensing system problems before they become serious and overwhelming. Even if you could train blacks to follow the manuals to the word, there&rsquo;s an intuitive art to running machines which blacks don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>The problem is that you can teach a black man to drive a car but few can learn to design, build, engineer, and maintain them with precision. <br>

		<p>No white person should take up the SA government on this &#8220;offer&#8221;. The best thing for the white race is for SA to become another failed African state, because this will show that racial equality is an obscene cultural-Marxist lie.</p>

<p>And so speaks a &#8220;general secretary&#8221; of the ANC?</p>
<p>And when I was growing up in the 80s and going to college in the 90s, all they ever told me was: &#8220;End Apartheid and put the ANC in power, and South Africa will thrive.&#8221; </p>
<p>Crazed or idiotic slogans like &#8220;affirmative action,&#8221; change nothing. They also neither &#8220;help,&#8221; nor ever &#8220;save,&#8221; anyone; what they do is raise expectations among the undeserving Third World and Red classes, to act upon crazed idiocy. In South Africa, this was doubly the case, since there were not enough whites to &#8220;go around,&#8221; so that every black could look &#8220;competent&#8221; or even &#8220;clever.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Americans or any other white people who hold a deified view of Multi Cultism, learn something here.</p>
<p>Becoming a minority in the lands where you hold current majority status, or putting a mullatto &#8220;savior&#8221; into office, &#8220;changes&#8221; nothing but the probability that all the nonwhites living or working next to you will suffer, in the long run.</p>
<p>Even if you and they are too stupid to realize this fact, at this comfortable moment in time, it will come to pass.</p>
<p>Just ask the ANC!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Too late!Most of them have left already, I know quite a few of them, they are all happy to come back as long as they can bring apartheid back with with them. Most of the ones who are left felt themselves too old to start all over again.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;d like to know is why they&rsquo;re going to need any skilled peacetime positions at all, because they&rsquo;re on the verge of disintegrating right now, and civil war with a white face is tapping them on their shoulders this very minute.  </p>
<p>The ANC despises the whites and have been waiting an opportune time to slaughter them all.  They don&rsquo;t want white skilled workers.  They want white victims of any kind.</p>
<p>I have no doubt the right wing groups have plenty of arms and ammo stashed in probably 500 different locations, plus they have access to planes, armored personnel carriers and rocket propelled grenades.  If they have enough forewarning and good contingency plans, they should be able to overwhelm the majority with down and dirty guerilla tactics, along with direct frontal attacks as the situation allows from time to time.</p>

		<p>Sorry to burst all the bubbles of hope &amp; optimism but the ANC will NEVER allow another party to win an election in that country. So don&rsquo;t worry about affirmative action for a while!!</p>
<p>Like Zimbabwe&rsquo;s ZANU-PF they will lie to, cheat &amp; intimidate the electorate to maintain power.{like most socialist political entities} This one however is very dangerous and as is the norm in Africa, if they feel they are going to lose the election or even a large majority of the vote, intimidation will be the order of the day. This intimidation will, as planned, lead to an &#8220;incident&#8221; which requires the declaration of a state of emergency. Hey Presto the elecions are called off indefinitely<br>
& Jacob Zuma is declared president for life or whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way Africa works. Get used to it.</p>

		<p>If ANY white person aids and assists this regime he and his ilk should be be forced to live with the results.  </p>
<p>First kicked away and now like a dog asked to participate for crumbs from the black masters table white people should vote with their feet.</p>
<p>White people need to regain some self respect and integrity.  If a society disenfranchises you and yours, then give that society no support, let it collapse.  Let the lesson be learned that far from being a &#8220;white derived system&#8221; that certain things work and certain things dont, irrespective of racial origination.  Don&rsquo;t participate, just &#8220;shrug&#8221; and let things collapse or just leave for more sensible pastures.  </p>

		<p>As an escaped South African now living in Spain, we left becasue we saw what was and now is ghappening.  I would never fly on an SA serviced aircraft now as most of tHe skilled (white and (indian)technicians have been forced out by AA. Remeber an enfgine falling off a Boeing 737 a year ago during takepff in SA?  Gold production is down 14% officially compared with a year ago and the world price is now very high, because the power stations are now run and serviced by AA appointees and cannot supply anywhere enough electricity.  </p>
<p>SA is now a great country for selling home power generators.  </p>
<p>Never happened in all the years of sanctions for Apartheid and I agree with most of the comments here about general low IQ levels of the AA appointees.   They are proving it themselves at all levels.     They will,be asking for Aid in about ten years  blaming global warming caused by the West in a few years.   But many there are learning Chinese now, the next colonisers because the West did not have the sense and justice to censure the terrorists now in power when they were blowing up women and children in the streets.   No wonder terrorim is a major problem now.  The West has been weak in the past and has shown that it eventually works.</p>

		<p>Do not be fooled by ANC marxist speak.  Alreday much higher qualified whites are working in skilled jobs for blacks who could never do their jobs due to lack of skills and ability.  The blacks in te ANC will never allow normal progression in their country.  And thsi was all forecasy by the old Apartheid government and a very good reason for Apartheid which eventually when SA is like Zimabawe is now, and it will will be proven to have been the right way to go in SA for the benefits of all South Africans regardless of race.  An empty stomach, no water and food is a poor example of giving the blacks their freedoms.   Under Apartheid they all lived very well, for Africans and many blacks from other African countries used to flood there for work.  Now they move TO SA out of desperation and risk being set on fire in their ramshackle homes (squatter capms) by black South Africans.</p>
<p><br>
The real racists are thsoe who denied the experts, the old Apartheid government, their system and encouraged Marxist terrorists to grab power.   Terrorists are useless at governmnet s they are just murdering gangsters.</p>

		<p>I remember someone quoting an old white south african woman (too old to leave in her own words, she was determined to die there) who stated that all the young white couples that could leave had left SA, &#8220;there&rsquo;s an entire generation missing&#8221; or something to that effect.</p>
<p>Expecting them to come back after they stole and ruined a first world country is nothing short of hilarious.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve followed developments in SA for several years now. I hate the fact that we Americans contributed to the downfall of Western Civ there, with our endless &#8220;end apartheid&#8221; kak. A tough, proud people down there endured for years, despite our sanctions. I don&rsquo;t know why we should expect any different results here in the US - the same thought processes tend to prevail now; infact they are far worse. </p>
<p>I loathe the thought of civil war, but far worse is the idea of rolling over and sacrificing our very souls. Suid Afrika - ek sal onthou</p>

		<p>This won&rsquo;t help, as many skilled, young S.A. whites are simply leaving the country.  Doubtless the subcontinental Indians are also leaving; they haven&rsquo;t been well-treated in any other east African country under black rule.</p>
<p>As infrastructure continues to collapse due to lack of skilled personnel to keep things running, the exit will accelerate.  People approaching retirement would be well-advised to leave, and move their pension plans into funds valued in dollars or Euros.  I imagine the hyperinflation associated with a Zimbabwe-style meltdown would put a pensioner living on a fixed income in a very vulnerable position.</p>

		<p>No more AA? Just another ploy to get whites to vote ANC. Yeah right; only dumb fools will fall for that one.</p>
<p>I have been sitting without work for a couple of years. Every position that I could possibly fill is for blacks only - OFFICIALLY - especially the government-type positions of which there are thousands of vacancies. Just check the local employment sections of the newspapers. Get out of this place while u can and pray for folks like me with no resources to leave!</p>
<p>ps: Here in SA, AA is directed AGAINST the MINORITY.</p>
