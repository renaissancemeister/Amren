			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Spencer S. Hsu, Washington Post, December 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Every few weeks for nearly four years, the Secret Service screened the IDs of employees for a Maryland cleaning company before they entered the house of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, the nation&rsquo;s top immigration official.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s owner says the workers sailed through the checks &mdash; although some of them turned out to be illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Now, owner James D. Reid finds himself in a predicament that he considers especially confounding. In October, he was fined $22,880 after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators said he failed to check identification and work documents and fill out required I-9 verification forms for employees, five of whom he said were part of crews sent to Chertoff&rsquo;s home and whom ICE told him to fire because they were undocumented.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration laws are unevenly enforced, he [Reid] added, allowing big companies to stay in business while crushing small-business owners and workers. He said the rules punish &#8220;scapegoats&#8221; such as him while inviting people at every level &mdash; customers, subcontractors and contractors &mdash; to look the other way while benefiting economically from cheaper labor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eric Zahren, a spokesman for the service, which is part of Chertoff&rsquo;s department, declined to discuss specific screening practices. But he said agents protecting the secretary &#8220;would have run the appropriate checks, screened and escorted people as appropriate in order to maintain the security of the residence and our protectee&rsquo;s security.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This matter illustrates the need for comprehensive immigration reform and the importance of effective tools for companies to determine the lawful status of their workforce,&#8221; he [Department of Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to the Chertoffs&rsquo; house, Reid said, his service once cleaned the Washington home of former president Bill Clinton and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), now secretary of state-designee, as well as homes of another Bush Cabinet member and Clinton Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. In those cases, he said, his company worked as a subcontractor and billing was done by a larger contractor firm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nantel [ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel] declined to say when the Chertoffs learned of the investigation. She likened the couple to restaurant or hotel customers who take the owner&rsquo;s word that its workers are legal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chertoff&rsquo;s situation appeared to be different from a case announced last week in which federal prosecutors arrested Lorraine Henderson, the Boston port director for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, another part of Chertoff&rsquo;s department, on charges that she repeatedly hired illegal immigrants to clean her condominium.<br>

		<p>Problem is, if an employer &#8220;investigates&#8221; checks out the legal status of an applicant and then does not hire the applicant because the applicant is illegal, the employer faces a $375,000 fine levied by the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department.</p>
<p>So employers are caught in a double bind.  If they don&rsquo;t hire illegals they are guilty of profiling and discrimination and face fines of $375,000 in addition to racial discrimination litigation by the numerous federally funded advocacy groups.</p>
<p>If they do fire illegals and get caught, nothing happens most of the time.  Every year, less than 100 employers of illegals pay fines of only $3,000 for knowingly hiring illegals.</p>

		<p>Our representatives don&rsquo;t care. They&rsquo;ll always choose the path of least resistance. They&rsquo;re scared to death of what they&rsquo;ve let in this country. They don&rsquo;t know what to do. </p>

Pretty much the same &#8220;catch-22&#8221; that the Clintonians used to strongarm mortagage companies to give loans to questionable recipients&hellip;<br>

<p>this demonstrates the need for MUCH HIGHER FINES AND JAIL TIME!</p>
<p>Lets start by making it a crime to present fake IDs on the forms punishable by years in jail, oh wait, it already is, just they IGNORE IT! jessss</p>

		<p>Chertoff, you looks uncannily like Lenin, is a member of the extreme, Chabad-Lubavitch sect.  They are confirmed internationalists, as in international communism.  By the way, Chertoff quietly hired two high ranking KGB officers, who specialized in domestic spying and suppressing dissent, to help us naive Americans with our &#8216;security&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, he hired Non-Americans to work for him  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s merely doing on a personal micro-level what he&rsquo;s also doing to us all on the macro-level.</p>

		<p>The four most over-rated things on the planet are 1, home cooking, home loving, Home land Security and the FBI. Chertoff is a horses`s rear end. He did not learn of the levee break up in Nagintown until he read about in the evening paers THE NEXT DAY. He couldn`t lead my old platoon to a house of ill fame after a year`s deployment in Antartica. The rest of his agency is just like him. We haven`t been hit again because it is not in God`s plan. Bush and Chertoff had nothing to do with it.<br>
     Our terrorist enemies are continually amazed about how clueless we seem to be all the time. We would be better off if the foreman of the gang of greasors left Jose to take over Homeland and hired Chertoff to prune his own rose bushes.<br>
     I have to admit I can`t stand the living breathing image of the villian Skeltor so forget about this essay and blame this humble scribe for propganda that just happens to be the truth.<br>
