<h1><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/chronicle/6147652.html">State Says Jesse Jackson Academy Owes $3.2 Million</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Radcliffe, Houston Chronicle, December 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A handful of teachers and families turned out at the Jesse Jackson Academy this morning to clean out their classrooms and get their transcripts to take to a new school.</p>
<p>The Houston charter school, which is run by the husband of Democratic state Rep. Alma Allen, was ordered closed Thursday by the Texas Education Agency.</p>
<p>The campus, at 5400 Griggs, must remain closed until it resolves several bookkeeping issues, state officials said. The campus, along with its sister school in Fort Worth that was closed last month, owes the federal government $3.2 million in misappropriated federal grants.</p>
<p>Teachers at the school hadn&rsquo;t gotten paid for about two months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials with the school, including Principal Lawrence Allen Sr., did not return calls seeking comment. Lawrence Allen&rsquo;s son is Lawrence Allen Jr., a Houston Independent School District administrator and the city&rsquo;s representative on the State Board of Education, which approves charter schools.</p>
<p>Commissioner Robert Scott write in a letter Thursday that the school may be able to reopen if it resolves all the outstanding issues. If not, the charter will be revoked, he warned.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t need to read this story to figure what was going on.  Just by reading that there is an institution named &#8220;Jesse Jackson Academy,&#8221; you can infer that&rsquo;s in debt up to its ears to governments and/or other businesses, that friends of friends of friends in power won&rsquo;t punish the &#8220;Academy,&#8221; that school officials are absconding with the money, and that student performance is horrible, mainly because most of their pedagogy revolves around Afro-centricism.</p>

<p>Misappropriated. Euphemism for stolen.</p>

		<p>Was the $3.2 million given to just the principle or did he at least spread around the &#8220;Loot&#8221;?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that this type of story still makes the news. It&rsquo;s pretty much assummed to be standard operating procedure.</p>
<p>(I don&rsquo;t think we should let any small issue that is wrong be forgotten. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong with this country. I don&rsquo;t ever want to be too comfortable in this life.) </p>

		<p>Think of all the shiney suits and caddies bought on the taxpayer&rsquo;s dime.  Among blacks, one must look &#8220;fly&#8221; at all times, and besides, as blacks are knee-jerk inclined to say, &#8220;whitey owes us&#8221;. Then there&rsquo;s that burning need for walk-around money. </p>
<p>There is no shame among so many blacks, so much so that it&rsquo;s probably now a permanent part of their culture.  To experience self-governing shame that stable people experience, one must respect the country one lives in as well as its laws. </p>
<p>If anyone wants to see how healthy shame is destroyed among blacks, see the so-called &#8220;reverend&#8221; Wright video.</p>

<p>Eventually they all fail.<br/>

		<p>This is simply another example of blacks being completely incapable of leading, building or maintaining any large institution or organization.  They just don&rsquo;t have the intelligence or ability to do so.</p>
<p>Barack Obama will be yet another example of this proven fact.  </p>

One clue that this school did not have a promising future at the time of its founding  &mdash;   it was named the &#8220;Jesse Jackson&#8221; school. What has Jesse Jackson done that merits having a school named after him?</p>

<p>About the same, maybe a little more than, Obama has done to be President of the United States.</p>

		<p>This brings to mind a news item from 2 years ago. A black high school guidance counselor got a paycheck for several million dollars due to a computer error. She immediately went on a spending spree, buying cars, jewelry, clothes, whatever luxury bling she could think of. Never give large sums of money to Africans to spend judiciously in the interest of others. Never. Most of it will always end up in their pockets.</p>

		<p>I believe it&rsquo;s the enabling power behind blacks that is the source of corruption .<br/>
Blacks do not do the organizing, blacks are pawns, when blacks are orgnaized, they get organized with alot of help from above. </p>

		<p>along the same lines as Cliff Y and the teacher on a spending spree. There is a lot of government contracting, ie shipyards and military supply ect in my area. About 12-15 years ago the government was having problems with the suppliers complaining about late payments taking about 60-90 for the suppliers to be paid so they changed policy and let the supply agents have a government credit card in thier name. It wasnt long before they found out that many of the blacks were charging stereos, car wheels, ect ect on the government cards. The guy that told me this said that as far as he knew it was only blacks abusing the cards and that they all got away with it with only a scolding. It must be great to be black and government employed!!!  KF   </p>
