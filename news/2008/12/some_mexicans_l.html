<h1>Some Mexicans Leaving US, Planning Never to Return</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ivan Moreno, AP, December 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After going months without a full-time job, Daniel Ramirez has decided it&rsquo;s time to return to family in Mexico.</p>
<p>Vicenta Rodriguez Lopez says she can&rsquo;t afford to live in Colorado any more because her husband was deported.</p>
<p>Roberto Espinoza is going back, too. After 18 years as a mechanic for a General Motors dealership in Denver, his work permit wasn&rsquo;t renewed and he didn&rsquo;t want to remain in the country illegally.</p>
<p>All are leaving Colorado in time for Christmas &mdash; joining a traditional holiday migration that will number almost 1 million people, says Mexico&rsquo;s interior ministry. But they have no intention of returning to Colorado, a place that promised prosperity.</p>
<p>Layoffs, dwindling job opportunities, anti-immigrant sentiment and the crackdown on illegal immigrants are forcing hard choices on many Mexican nationals in Colorado. Though not an exodus, some are returning to a nation they haven&rsquo;t seen in years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s consul general in Denver, Eduardo Arnal, said more people like Ramirez are going home for good.</p>
<p>He cites a rise in applications for import tax exemptions by Mexican nationals bringing home their belongings. The consulate hasn&rsquo;t compiled statistics for 2008 but says it receives about three applications a day, compared to one per week in 2007.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve seen an increase in this service, which implies that there&rsquo;s a tendency among a larger number of Mexicans who are returning home definitively,&#8221; Arnal said in an interview in Spanish.</p>
<p>Nationally, 1,809 Mexican immigrants filed for the exemption between January and August, compared to 1,447 the same period last year &mdash; a 25 percent increase, according to Mexico&rsquo;s foreign affairs ministry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An estimated 243,253 Mexicans lived in Colorado in 2007, down from 254,844 in 2006, according to the U.S. Census. The state&rsquo;s construction industry, a traditional source of employment for Mexicans, is contracting, and University of Colorado economists expect the state to lose 11,200 construction jobs next year.</p>
<p>Nationally, remittances to Mexico are down, as is Mexican emigration to the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s National Statistics and Geography Institute estimates that 814,000 Mexicans emigrated to the U.S. in 2006, compared to 1.2 million in 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Camacho [Gustavo Camacho, 43, who works for a firm digging trenches for electrical cables in Denver], who is from Jalisco, has been here twice, from 1999-2003 and again since 2005. The first time, he saved enough money for a house in Jalisco. This time, he has enough to start a business &mdash; either a car repair shop or selling food on the street.</p>
<p>He wants his six children to grow up in Mexico, where he thinks family values are stronger.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with the one guy in this article, alot of these people are just moving to other parts of the US like my city Las Vegas. But, there isn&rsquo;t anything for them here either construction has dried up. Yet, I still see them hanging out by nurserys and Home Depots. Looks like you have to keep running them out from town to town. Also, this woman in the article states her husband was &#8220;deported&#8221;, yet she still lives here instead of going back to Mexico to be with him? How does she support herself here? No doubt, she&rsquo;s waiting for him re-cross illegally back into this country.</p>

		<p>It is tearing at me. They might never come back. If it gets too bad I might go visit them some year, or maybe never. What are Americans supposed to do who read these kinds of stories  &mdash;  cry? Certain Mexican illegal foreign nationals, who have disrespected the laws of this nation by just being here without premission, have now found out that they can&rsquo;t get everything in the U.S. they wanted to and the streets are not lined with gold. I have a suggestion, start from wheverever you are in the U.S., go south and keep walking until you come to Mexico, and then stop and stay put.  </p>

		<p>What this article does not seem to mention are the many Mexicans leaving Mexico, coming to the U.S., planning never to return.  That is, until where they are in the U.S. gets annexed by Mexico.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Roberto Espinoza is going back, too. After 18 years as a mechanic for a General Motors dealership in Denver, his work permit wasn&rsquo;t renewed and he didn&rsquo;t want to remain in the country illegally.&#8221;</p>
<p>And General Motors is one of the auto companies, that we &#8220;undeserving&#8221; whites should &#8220;bail out&#8221; with our hard earned and universally unrecovered tax dollars?</p>
<p>And then what percentage of that will go to: Zimbabwe, Cuba, or Palestine, after that?</p>
<p>To hell with them all, I say!</p>
<p>To hell with them all, I say again!!!</p>
<p>Let them find: Indians, Chinese, and Mexicans to both fund and &#8220;structure&#8221; their &#8220;futures,&#8221; as they would have them do for us! Let the &#8220;bail out&#8221; for the &#8220;Big 3&#8221; come from their &#8220;engineering departments,&#8221; which are now distinctly 3rd World. Let them get the money that way and not through the people they have betrayed, and the same goes for the Feds. </p>
<p>Oh, oops, as this article points out: that money is already back in Mexico or Calcutta.</p>
<p>Now What, Traitors?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>This so-called migration is really minimal. However, if this economy continues its death throes into 2009, all the way to 2012, when a severe depression is forecast, then Jose and friends should be making tracks south in huge droves.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fools for coming up here to begin with, because they have a country that has the potential for being the wealthiest in Latin America, with two shorelines of beautiful beaches, untold wealth in ores and minerals, as well as a huge supply of oil.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve allowed the corrupt government and the drug cartels to control the country.  These are the same whiners who will protest here about almost anything, and most of them don&rsquo;t like whites or white culture, yet they won&rsquo;t try to improve their nation, so they come to our country and try to change us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to leave here because of no work, and they&rsquo;ll be returning home to gunfire in the streets.</p>
<p>It serves them right for being too lazy to try to improve their conditions to begin with.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s going to be interesting what kind of pressures (economic, political, and social) these people are going to be exerting on the Mexican establishment after having lived the &#8220;good life&#8221; here in a relatively functional nation state.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s incredible to me is that more than a decade ago, I recall Mexicans who worked at my work facility endlessly grumbling about how they wanted to go back to Mexico. As every AR reader would understand the only motivation to be here in the US was apprently money, benefits, etc.(although to be fair, many Mexicans at that time looked down their nose at Blacks who were always on the dole in one manner or another). But the point was clear then and obviously is now - America is a cash-cow for &#8220;south-of-the-border&#8221; types to plunder at will&hellip;all with out government&rsquo;s blessing, of course!  </p>

		<p>This is very welcome and should continue at least until Obama&rsquo;s team makes definitive announcements that they are stopping raids and enforcement.  Hopefully this is one area where the slumping economy will actually HELP real American citizens&hellip;as the Obama team may read the political tea leaves to mean that they would be inviting a maelstrom to stop enforcement or to even entertain the idea of any amnesty with so many real citizens in trouble economically.</p>

		<p>What the government couldnt or wouldnt do is being done by the economy. Here in NC I would say that 1/2 of the mexicans have returned and a lot more are planning it simply due to no construction jobs any more. I speak spanish and many tell me this. And I have also noticed that in WalMart on a sat or sun afternoon it used to be wall to wall mexicans but now is only 1/2 wall to wall, a lot less. They also tell me that a lot are heading to Texas for hurricane repair.  </p>

		<p>For 12 years I worked on the southern border, apprehending illegal immigrants. I have no idea how many thousands of them I interrogated, and not ONCE did any of them say they wanted to come here because of democracy or self determination. They just wanted to come up and make money and send it to Mexico or Central America. THey are generally contemptuous of our government and our society, but this is where the bucks are. Now the Demonrats will undoubtedly try to foist another shamnesty on us, and create another 15 million entitlement voters.<br>
  Ice is right on target with his post. I never had an ounce of sympathy for the illegals because they have never made the sacrifices to hold their own government accountable. On the other hand, we have less and less reason to feel superior in our own country, since we are sitting in our living rooms watching the mental pablum on TV while the U.S. turns socialist.</p>

		<p>Yeah, what they don&rsquo;t mention is that for every 100 who decide to leave, 1,000 more pour right in. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that Mexicans are sitting on one of the world&rsquo;s greatest goldmines.  Yet, they don&rsquo;t even realize it. </p>
<p>Consider, Mexico has Oil, lots of it. Natural resources, lots of it. Beautiful beaches, scenery, the country is a money magnet just waiting to happen.  Heck, if the Mexicans really played their cards right, they could make Mexico into such a fabulous place that you&rsquo;d have Americans, lots of Americans begging to live there. So why don&rsquo;t they make it happen? </p>

		<p>Sorry but they are NOT leaving!! As long as there is one buck to be had by some freebie or other, they will stay. What needs to be done is&hellip;get them ALL OFF OF WELFARE AND FREE MEDICADE AND ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS THEY GET FOR NOTHING AND WE GET ROBBED FOR OVER AND OVER AGAIN!! Once all freebies are cut off, then they will flee in great numbers, until then, forget about it!</p>

		<p>One million out of the 20 - 30 million or more that are here illegally.<br>
Really! That doesn&rsquo;t even qualify as newsworthy.<br>
Maybe if there are no longer any opportunities for them north of the border, they&rsquo;ll stay put and exert themselves toward making their own country a better place to live, instead of dragging ours down.</p>

		<p>Yea right. Where? This is a hoax. If anything the present drug wars in Mexico that are spilling over the border will keep them here and with Obama in office following their beloved Bush there is no doubt America is where they want to be. </p>
<p>Mexicans get free food free education free medical care free housing free pocket money and live in a society that is much safer than that in mexico and they want to leave? This is a joke. </p>
<p>Go check the local school schools and see if any mexicans have left or go to LA or NYC or Chicago or houston or Dallas etc etc .</p>
<p>They are increasing not decreasing.</p>

<p>Well, cry me a river and don&rsquo;t let the door slam you on your way out!</p>
<p>Our &#8220;leaders&#8221; in Congress are deliberately keeping our southern border wide open and encouraging this never-ending onslaught of Third World poverty all in the name of personal power and greed.  Plenty of cheap labor for the corporations and plenty of votes for the politicians&hellip;  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the bottom line for our top elites, and the rest of us can stand in soup lines.</p>

		<p>If the end justifies the means (and it does) then the ethnic cleansing of Hispanic illegals is morally acceptable.  If this proposal triggers your righteous indignation I suggest you carefully consider the alternative.  If you find the alternative acceptable I suggest you pay for Spanish lessons for your entire family, since the defeated are always forced to learn the language of their conquerors.  I also suggest you find a safe place to stay out of the crossfire&hellip;  </p>
