<h1>Monkey Meat Is Confiscated at Dulles</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Mummolo, Washington Post, December 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Customs officials searching the bags of an African man who flew into Dulles International Airport on Friday discovered three charred monkeys in his luggage, as well as deer meat and dried beef, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The monkey carcasses, inadmissible under U.S. law, were confiscated and are being inspected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; monkeys can easily introduce infectious diseases to humans, Sapp said. The other meat was destroyed, and the man was allowed to enter the country without penalty, Sapp said.</p>
<p>Foreigners visiting the United States sometimes try to bring with them exotic foods that are part of their native cuisines, especially around the holidays. But this was &#8220;a first for many of us,&#8221; Sapp said.</p>
<p>Primates are a common food source in the Central African region, said Heather E. Eves, director of the Bushmeat Crisis Task Force, a nonprofit that researches the trade in African &#8220;bushmeat,&#8221; the flesh of wild animals. Eves said that the monkeys&rsquo; charred appearance comes from the animals&rsquo; being smoked and that the meat is typically used to make stew.</p>
<p>Primates are also known to carry diseases such as monkeypox, HIV/AIDS and Ebola, she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;A Taste of Baboon and Monkey Meat, and Maybe of Prison, Too&#8221;<br>
Ellen Barry, The New York Times, November 17, 2007<br>

&hellip; The bushmeat case &#8220;represents the sort of clash of cultural and religious values inherent in the &#8216;melting pot&rsquo; that is America.&#8221; </p>

		<p>CNN had a documentary on a few days ago that had to do with a lack of game available to the tribes for eating.  Many areas in the jungles have been hunted to depletion.</p>
<p>If any other race of people lived there besides blacks, especially whites, there would be fields cleared for crops which would be in abundance, plus artificial lakes would be constructed in various areas filled with fish.</p>
<p>This is just more of the same black inability to care for themselves and more reasons why they have to emigrate to Western countries in order to be provided for.</p>
<p>To show their appreciation they fill the courts, jails and prisons, and contribute nothing but a cocky delusional arrogance that keeps the area they&rsquo;re in in constant turmoil.</p>

		<p>I wonder how simian immunodeficiency virus made the jump to the human population?  </p>
<p>If you think the dietary habits of some non-whites are disgusting consider the fact that is Whites who encourage their own destruction by adopting the tenents marxism, among which include &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multicultural&#8221; worship.  At least this monkey eater is making some effort to preserve his own culture.  </p>
<p>Whites eat venison and beef, and I know Ted Nugent has killed monkeys with a bow, then fried them up. I don&rsquo;t think he packed it up on the flight home.</p>

		<p>Medical research carried out seems to indicrtwe that AIDS was caused by Tanzanians eating monkeys.  So monkey meat must be a prohibited import, as it is in mnay other countries, for all Americans&rsquo; sakes.</p>

<p>Blacks and illegals can do anything without penalty. The message has certainly gotten around.</p>

		<p>Monkey meat is a natural food for African blacks but the alltime most popular food in America for them for centuries is the intestines of hogs aka chitterings or &#8220;chittins&#8221; that has long been eaten in holidays and other times specially prepared by recipes brought down through the ages. <br>
In many respects the monkey is probably much less disgusting than the foul smelling hog intestines. </p>

<p>     I really believe it your right, rather than in a C.I.A. laboratory.</p>
<p>Even well fed Africans seem to have a thing for &#8220;Bush Meat&#8221;<br>
Some Gorilla&rsquo;s and Chimps have been eaten besides monkeys. </p>

		<p>The article does not say which species of monkeys were involved, but the fellow would have been in very serious legal trouble if gorilla or chimpanzee meat had been found.  These are protected from international traffic as Article One endangered species under the CITES treaty.</p>

<p>Forgive me if I&rsquo;m being picky, but I don&rsquo;t believe you can get AIDS from  &#8220;EATING&#8221;  anything.  (Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.)  </p>
<p>I think the danger would come from  the butchering of the animal, the handing of the flesh, the contact with blood, etc&hellip;. Eating fully COOKED meat would appear to be safe (not that I&rsquo;m advocating it!!!)</p>

		<p>Eating fully cooked meat probably is safe, at least from an HIV standpoint; the virus does not appear to be very durable.  Much of this primate meat is simply smoked, however, and probably not very thoroughly at that.</p>
<p>Ever been sick for a few days from not cooking chicken long enough?  I have.  Taking chances like this with primate meat, from which a human could catch literally anything the animal was carrying, seems to me an appalling risk.</p>

<p>Absolutely!  It&rsquo;s not worth the risk.  I wrote the 8:17 post above.  While it&rsquo;s my understanding that AIDS itself cannot be contracted by something that you &#8220;eat&#8221; (as you say, the virus is not very hardy), nonetheless there are some other horrible, wasting diseases that surely can be contracted   &mdash;   even from fully cooked or dried meat (as for example, mad cow disease). I note that you cannot bring from certain countries meat that is even cooked and canned (eg. canned corned beef). </p>
