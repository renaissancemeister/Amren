<h1>Black Leaders See Senate Seat Being Hijacked</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Washington, Chicago Sun-Times, December 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bye bye, black Senate seat! The political blackbirds are singing a swan song for the hopes of keeping a U.S. Senate seat in African-American hands. The Rod Blagojevich implosion may have dealt that cause a fatal blow.</p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s stunning pay-to-play charges led to calls around the nation for a special election to choose President-elect Barack Obama&rsquo;s successor.</p>
<p>That possibility has provoked outrage among black community leaders and politicians. Not so fast, they are saying.</p>
<p>Last month, the Concerned Clergy of Illinois demanded that the governor appoint a &#8220;qualified&#8221; African American &#8220;who can fill this vacancy and who has the capacity to be re-elected when [Obama&rsquo;s] term ends in 2010.&#8221; The problem, as I wrote then, is that black leaders were at odds on who should get the nod.</p>
<p>After the Blago bomb hit, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush of Chicago&rsquo;s 1st Congressional District gave some big love to the beleaguered Senate wannabe, U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. The minister&rsquo;s group is solidly behind him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an interview on MSNBC, Rush added, &#8220;I think that we should have at least one African American in the United States Senate, and I think that African American should be Jesse Jackson Jr.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the concerned clergy, a cadre of several dozen prominent black ministers, are &#8220;appalled&#8221; by the fallout of the sensational federal investigation. They see it as a thinly veiled attempt by white pols to hijack the seat, says Stephanie Gadlin, the coalition&rsquo;s spokeswoman.</p>
<p>While they aren&rsquo;t ready to coalesce around Jackson, they are gearing up for a fight. There&rsquo;s a massive conspiracy afoot, Gadlin says. &#8220;We see it for what it is. What we are really looking at is &lsquo;The Luck of the Irish&rsquo; &mdash; two Madigans, Fitzgerald, Durbin, Cullerton, Claypool, Daley, and all the rest. They&rsquo;re making a power play to regain the control of the politics, money and jobs in this state.&#8221;</p>
<p>An invigorated push for Triple J may be a tad premature. Still, I am heartened that black leaders may finally be learning the lesson that politics is about addition, not subtraction. Until the Blagojevich debacle, they were flopping around divided and ineffectual, bickering and floating an avalanche of names: Davis, Burris, Jarrett, Jackson, Jones, Raoul, Turner, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>White voters don&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t accept the idea that America and Illinois need &mdash; and deserve &mdash; a black senator. (When the Senate was all white, they never complained).</p>

<p>Yeah, sure, in order to push that conservative agenda that all of the above are famous for.</p>
<p>Really, what would be the voting difference between having &#8220;Triple J&#8221; in the Senate compared to any white Democrat?  Almost none.</p>
<p>Why I&rsquo;m hoping for a special election is that maybe the Republicans could flip the seat.  I think the IL Dems know it and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re dragging their heels, hoping to convince RodB to resign, so that Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn can step in and fill the seat, no election necessary.</p>

		<p>What could be more fair than holding an election and letting the citizens decide who the new senator will be? Any fair minded person would agree with that. But then we arent talking about fair minded people, are we? We are talking about people who want special privileges and rights. And Im guessing they will get their way in this case. Again.</p>

		<p>Can it be any more clear that blacks need their own country seperate from whites.  Having a &#8220;black&#8221; president is now not nearly enough, they demand senate seats, political favors and appointments it will never end.  Now a college can&rsquo;t even hire a football coach without never ending admonishments if they fail to give the job to a black.  </p>

		<p>Good grief, they&rsquo;re all exhibiting the same mentality. Like that buffoon Chuckie Barkley whining that a black man was cheated out of the Auburn coaching job by ol&rsquo; whitey. A black man was entitled to it doncha know. Get over it. This entitlement mentality reinforced by white liberal guilt just enabled a non-qualified black man get elected to the highest office in the land. Shout it out. The entitlement era is OFFICIALLY OVER!</p>

		<p> Laura Washington and other blacks in Illinois obviously want &#8220;The Big O&#8221; (I thought that was Oscar Robertson?!) to be an African-American president first, and president of the United States second. I agree with her on that, if nothing else: Obama is not going to urge that a black be appointed Illinois&rsquo; junior senator just because he or she is black. But if they think that blacks &#8220;deserve&#8221; a senate seat, then let them get out and support one in the upcoming special election.</p>
<p> Washington and others of her ilk merely show their usual black paranoia when they assume that there is some type of a deep, dark (no pun intended) plot to put the senate seat back in White hands. The main thing that Illinois voters want more than anything else is to have Rod &#8220;The Clod&#8221; Blagojevich out of the governor&rsquo;s office. I suspect that whoever is elected senator is a secondary concern of theirs.</p>

		<p>Are senate seats subject to a quota system? Many blacks obviously think so, including Bobby Rush, a former member of the Black Panther Party.  Rush would like to see Jesse Jackson Jr.<br>
(D-Budweiser) given the seat.  Can we expect to have affirmative action senators in the  future?  Some evidence would suggest that JJJ has already tried to offer the Gov. a quid pro quo <br>
for the seat.  Hopefully, AG Fitzgerald will flush these negotiations out into the open,  A special election will be expensive but one is probably needed.<br>

<p>As a white female, I would not complain about a black having a seat in the Senate; Rep. or Dem., male or female, if he/she got there on his/her own merit. I might not agree with his/her stance, but we&rsquo;d get to that later. </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see  &mdash;  there are 100 senators, and Blacks constitute 13% of the population.  Therefore there should be 13 Black senators.  If there are only 12 or 10, that&rsquo;s proof of racism.  If there are zero, that&rsquo;s proof of incompetence.</p>

		<p>Affirmative action (AA) is slowly destroying South Africa where it is an official policy since the terrorists took over there in 1994.   I read today that SA gold production is down 14% compared with the same period last year (plus much other less production of SA goods with new comapnies being advised not to move their with their factories due to lack of electrical power)this year because of widespread electricity power-station failures caused mainly by the inability of the black AA appointed companies to transport the coal from the mine storage areas to the power stations.  Thsi has been a major problem for well over a year now, plus faulty maintenance of the equipment by the new AA technical staff.  This never happened before in t eold days.   Now in the media. I read once again that African Americans want their own black-ruled States in the USA, completely separate from the USA (except of course for the usual handouts I guess).  Why were they so against Apartheid then as this was the main policy of that system?  It would have worked in SA if the country had been left alone as time is telling now and the Marxist terrorists eliminated or discouraged.</p>

<p>Your logic is false, because all 100 Senators are NOT elected by a nationwide pool of voters - there are 2 senators per state.  Therefore, unless a state is at least 50% black, there&rsquo;s no proportionality problem when no blacks are elected to Senate. Even Mississippi is only 36% black!  </p>
<p>If whites voted like blacks, no blacks would EVER be elected to Senate. <br>

<i>&#8220;Having a &ldquo;black&rdquo; president is now not nearly enough, they demand senate seats, political favors and appointments it will never end.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I live in Buffalo, NY and we have a black mayor, black chief of police, black school commissioner, black state representatives, and majority black school boards and it&rsquo;s still not enough for blacks because their condition, regardless of the race of the person is any office, never improves.</p>
<p>I listen to black radio. Blacks are obsessed with having &#8216;their own&rsquo; leaders but they are always disappointed with them because they don&rsquo;t have the right black attitude, they&rsquo;re doing things the way the white people who elected them want them to, and they&rsquo;re not doing things &#8216;the  black way or the right way&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A couple good examples are jail and schools. Though our chief of police is black, he keeps arresting blacks disproportionately because he&rsquo;s following the white mans rules and doing things the white mans way. Though our school commissioner is black, he refuses to have a have afrocentric courses so blacks will feel pride and then excel.</p>
<p>Even though people in power are black, blacks still don&rsquo;t see it as enough because they believe that the entire system is racist to the core. Even though they demand black representation, their lot in life barely improves because of institutional racism and the system of white supremacy. They see the black leaders they elect as doing the work of the white man and not the black man.</p>
<p>What black can&rsquo;t see is that they are the source of their own problems and do no better under black rule and in the case of majority black nations under black rule, far worse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when blacks have true black leaders with true black attitudes who do things the true black way that you get Zimbabwe, Uganda, Haiti, Sudan, Congo, etc.<br>

The seat is going Dem anyway so I hope Blind Davey picks Fat Al or somebody else outrageous. More likely would be someone like Gregory Meeks, but the point would be clear: We puts in our OWN, whitey!

<p>You missed the irony and humor in that comment.  The &#8216;false logic&rsquo; you point out is an example of &#8216;Black logic&rsquo;, which is a special kind of logic that we have all been brainwashed into accepting as legitimate.  Until you learn to think like the average  Black person, much of what you see in the media will seem illogical.</p>

		<p>Is this any surprise to anyone - really?  It doesn&rsquo;t stop there either.  That Hispanic CNN contributor in San Diego wrote a few a couple weeks ago about how Obama was failing to appoint enough Hispanics.  There was an automatic assumption on his part that reflects the Hispanic - and other &#8220;minority&#8221; communities; &#8220;If we claim to represent a certain percentage of the votes that helped lead to an election win, the same percentage of &#8220;our people&#8221; ought to have power in the administration.&#8221;  This attitude is derived from the mentallity of a group seeing itself as pushing for a takeover via racial, ethnic, and national allegience as opposed to the traditional, established one.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t most people see and understand this?</p>

		<p>Before the scandal broke everyone in Illinois presumed that Emil Jones would get the senate seat. He is black, a mentore of BHO and one of the few friends Blago has. His health is not good, so in two years he may not run for reelection. This would clear the way for blago to run for that seat. Boy, were we surprised that Blago was willing to sell it to others for money.<br>
   Now they may have an election and well a white guy may get in. Sometimes life is fair.</p>

		<p>Black machine politics is going to be a ball and chain around Obama&rsquo;s ankle.  While many blacks think that Obama will be the dispenser of gravy he will probably be forced to make &#8220;reforms&#8221; lest he look like a bigot himself.  Bush was probably the worst thing that could have ever happened to neocons, evangelicals, and true conservatives.  Let&rsquo;s HOPE Obama can do the same for racial and liberal politics.  </p>

		<p>Now that they have a Black president, will they be offended if a White man ever runs for the office again?</p>

		<p>Even down to my step aerobics class on Monday nights, rotating a black woman and a white woman teaching every other week, there were 4 blacks in the class on Monday. I never see any blacks in a step class the rest of the week. Oops! It was the white teacher&rsquo;s turn this week. I choose the white woman, Margret, over the black woman. Margret is over 50. I&rsquo;ve been taking from her since I was in high school. She&rsquo;s killer! Teaching aerobics is probably the only job that Glenise, younger than 30, has. She&rsquo;s only been taking aerobics for a few years. She&rsquo;s not the best. I don&rsquo;t play around when I work out, efficiency. I want the best. I do my best. They can think I&rsquo;m racist if they want. </p>

This Caroline Kennedy name privilege brings up the idea in the Constitution of nobility being barred from office. I&rsquo;d like to see this CHANGE; for the people, by the people. I&rsquo;d like to see some silver-spooned do-nothings running scared because they couldn&rsquo;t get or do a job on their own.</p>

		<p>I love all this.<br>
Consecutive USA administrations harrassed &amp; cajoled the whole of Southern Africa to submit to black rule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be great to sit back &amp; watch you go down the tubes as well &amp; we&rsquo;ll be laughing so much louder because you will lose so much more so much quicker. How long before you are in the minority?</p>

		<p>Anonymous at 12:07 p.m. on 12/17: <i>Try to explain the concept of representational government, a constitutional republic, or a meritocracy to a Black person and just watch their eyes glaze over as they mutter, &lsquo;Whatever!&rsquo; under their breath.</i></p>
<p>Just like the old saying about not trying to teach a pig to sing   &mdash;   it wastes time and annoys the pig. Also why I&rsquo;ve never given any of my pets algebra lessons. And yes, I did get the irony/sarcasm in the post to which Jill responded. As William Shatner once noted, irony can be pretty ironic.</p>
<p>I now repeat my long-standing assertion that the 17th Amendment was perhaps the greatest travesty in American political history, and is the amendment most in need of repeal. Can anyone imagine the Illinois legislature, however whacked out it might be, appointing BHO or JJJ to the Senate? Or the NY legislature appointing Hillary? The Founders wisely divided Congress into the people&rsquo;s voice (the House) and the states&rsquo; voice (the Senate); the 17th Amendment destroyed that balance.</p>

		<p>  Well Grahsm R., I was not laughing when I saw what happened in South Africa.  I knew that blacks in South Africa had the highest standard of living of any blacks in Africa.  I saw what happened in Rhodesia.<br>
   You should not go on a site where people are sympathetic to your plight in S.A. and insult us.<br>
    Whites are fragmented.  We need to stick together.  Graham, do you really believe that the people on this site are the ones that support the blscks in S.A.?  If so you are mistaken.</p>

		<p>Gregory Meeks was actually somewhat vocal in his support of Hillary over Barry in the primaries; I don&rsquo;t know if that will work for, or against him.</p>
