			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ari B. Bloomekatz, Los Angeles Times, December 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Maywood voters will go to the polls today to decide whether to recall three of five City Council members and adopt an ordinance that would boost the qualifications for police chief and discourage nepotism in city hiring practices.</p>
<p>Supporters of the recall drive and Measure M said their campaign stemmed from the council&rsquo;s decision in February to appoint Al Hutchings, who was convicted of theft and resigned from the Los Angeles Police Department, as the city&rsquo;s interim police chief. Mayor Felipe Aguirre and council members Veronica Guardado and Ana Rosa Rizo are the targets of the recall effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;They voted three to two in favor of Alfred Hutchings,&#8221; said Ramon Medina, 49, who hopes to unseat Aguirre in today&rsquo;s election. The auto repair shop owner said he voted for Aguirre when he first ran for office in 2005.</p>
<p>But after Hutchings&rsquo; appointment, Medina said, he felt the mayor was not acting in the best interest of the city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two weeks after Hutchings&rsquo; appointment, the City Council voted unanimously to appoint Maywood Police Cmdr. Frank Hauptmann as interim chief.</p>
<p>But senior Assistant Atty. Gen. Louis Verdugo said at the time that in selecting Hutchings, Maywood may have violated state and city legal codes regarding background checks and qualifications for those serving as chief of police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The proposed ordinance would also amend the municipal code by adding a chapter titled &#8220;Nepotism.&#8221; It would require that &#8220;no public official shall appoint, employ or participate in the hiring, employment decision or the contracting of any person, employee or contractor that is an immediate family member.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This is not just a sanctuary city.  The police force ended giving traffic tickets for fear of having to arrest illegals for driving without licenses or  with their fraudulent licenses.</p>
<p>It is a small version of corrupt, crime ridden Mexico.  And why not?  It is peopled by Mexicans.</p>

		<p>Maywood is an incredible case of the lawlessness and  outright complacency of the criminal corruption that can go on in a U.S. city, because of illegal immigration. At least half of that cities residents are here illegally and should be deported. The corruption in city hall and the police department is, well, Mexican style corruption. You give me this and I&rsquo;ll let you do this, etc. The way Maywood is run is not much different from a small city in Mexico, except that it&rsquo;s possibly more corrupt. I know because I live a few miles away and have read over the years of the criminality that goes on there. It used to be a perfect example of small town America, about 35 years ago. It had wide sidewalks and big trees with a safe and quiet  neighborhood. Incredible!!</p>

		<p>What they&rsquo;re not telling us in this story is that many of these people are on the payroll of the Mexican drug cartels as are hundreds of other politicians near the border, and they&rsquo;re there to combat immigration control and to promote the cartels any way they possibly can.</p>

		<p>An anti-nepotism ordinance in Maywood? You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding. From an electorate that is Mexican born and has multiple aliases??  </p>

		<p>ACLU and other enemies of this nation want to make us believe that ignoring the obvious statistical relation between person&rsquo;s &#8220;ethnicity&#8221; and the likelihood that he will side with his compatriots against Americans is not only noble but actuially mandated by the law.</p>
<p>Nothing forther from the truth. Not noticing the obvious (like that average Mexican will side with other Mexicans even if it means subverting the law and hurting Americans) is not only not required by the law but it&rsquo;s plain stupid. And if someone, like ACLU, insists that self-inflicted stupidity is somehow noble then it just proves how destructive their advice is.<br>
