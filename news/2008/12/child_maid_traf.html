<h1>Child Maid Trafficking Spreads From Africa to US</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rukmini Callimachi, AP, December 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Late at night, the neighbors saw a little girl at the kitchen sink of the house next door.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shyima was 10 when a wealthy Egyptian couple brought her from a poor village in northern Egypt to work in their California home. She awoke before dawn and often worked past midnight to iron their clothes, mop the marble floors and dust the family&rsquo;s crystal. She earned $45 a month working up to 20 hours a day. She had no breaks during the day and no days off.</p>
<p>The trafficking of children for domestic labor in the U.S. is an extension of an illegal but common practice in Africa. Families in remote villages send their daughters to work in cities for extra money and the opportunity to escape a dead-end life. Some girls work for free on the understanding that they will at least be better fed in the home of their employer.</p>
<p>The custom has led to the spread of trafficking, as well-to-do Africans accustomed to employing children immigrate to the U.S. Around one-third of the estimated 10,000 forced laborers in the United States are servants trapped behind the curtains of suburban homes, according to a study by the National Human Rights Center at the University of California at Berkeley and Free the Slaves, a nonprofit group. No one can say how many are children, especially since their work can so easily be masked as chores.</p>
<p>Once behind the walls of gated communities like this one, these children never go to school. Unbeknownst to their neighbors, they live as modern-day slaves, just like Shyima, whose story is pieced together through court records, police transcripts and interviews.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For a year, Shyima, 9, worked in the Cairo apartment owned by Amal Motelib and Nasser Ibrahim. Every month, Shyima&rsquo;s mother came to pick up her salary.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of children in Africa, some as young as 3, are recruited every year to work as domestic servants. They are on call 24 hours a day and are often beaten if they make a mistake. Children are in demand because they earn less than adults and are less likely to complain. In just one city &mdash; Casablanca &mdash; a 2001 survey by the Moroccan government found more than 15,000 girls under 15 working as maids.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department found that over the past year, children have been trafficked to work as servants in at least 33 of Africa&rsquo;s 53 countries. Children from at least 10 African countries were sent as maids to the U.S. and Europe. But the problem is so well hidden that authorities &mdash; including the U.N., Interpol and the State Department &mdash; have no idea how many child maids now work in the West.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By the time the Ibrahims decided to leave, Shyima&rsquo;s family had taken several loans from them for medical bills. The Ibrahims said they could only be repaid by sending Shyima to work for them in the U.S. A friend posed as her father, and the U.S. embassy in Cairo issued her a six-month tourist visa.</p>
<p>She arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 3, 2000, according to court documents. The family brought her back to their spacious five-bedroom, two-story home, decorated in the style of a Tuscan villa with a fountain of two angels spouting water through a conch. She was told to sleep in the garage.</p>
<p>It had no windows and was neither heated nor air-conditioned. Soon after she arrived, the garage&rsquo;s only light bulb went out. The Ibrahims didn&rsquo;t replace it. From then on, Shyima lived in the dark.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the family slept, she ironed the school outfits of the Ibrahims&rsquo; 5-year-old twin sons. She woke them, combed their hair, dressed them and made them breakfast. Then she ironed clothes and fixed breakfast for the three girls, including Heba, who at 10 was the same age as the family&rsquo;s servant.</p>
<p>Neither Ibrahim nor his wife worked, and they slept late. When they awoke, they yelled for her to make tea.</p>
<p>While they ate breakfast watching TV, she cleaned the palatial house. She vacuumed each bedroom, made the beds, dusted the shelves, wiped the windows, washed the dishes and did the laundry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She started wetting her bed. Her sheets stank. So did her oversized T-shirt and the other hand-me-downs she wore.</p>
<p>While doing the family&rsquo;s laundry, she slipped her own clothes into the load. Madame slapped her. &#8220;She told me my clothes were dirtier than theirs. That I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to clean mine there,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She washed her clothes in a bucket in the garage. She hung them to dry outside, next to the trash cans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It never occurred to her to run away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought this was normal,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a sense that children should work to help their family, but also that they are being given an opportunity,&#8221; said Mark Lagon, the director of the U.S. State Department&rsquo;s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2006, a U.S. district court in Michigan sentenced a Cameroonian man to 17 years in prison for bringing a 14-year-old girl from his country to work as his unpaid maid. That same year, a Moroccan couple was sentenced to home confinement for forcing their 12-year-old Moroccan niece to work grueling hours caring for their baby.</p>
<p>In Germantown, Md., a Nigerian couple used their daughter&rsquo;s passport to bring in a 14-year-old Nigerian girl as their maid. She worked for them for five years before escaping in 2001. In Germany, France, the Netherlands and England, African immigrants have been arrested for forcing children from their home countries to work as their servants.</p>
<p>In several of these cases, the employers argued that they took the children with the parents&rsquo; permission. The Cameroonian girl&rsquo;s mother flew to Detroit to testify in court against her daughter, saying the girl was ungrateful for the good life her employers had provided her.</p>
<p>Shyima&rsquo;s mother, Salwa Mahmoud, said her father believed she would have better opportunities in America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For months Shyima lied to investigators, saying what the Ibrahims had told her to say.</p>
<p>She went without sleep for days at a stretch. She was put on four different types of medication. She moved from foster home to foster home. Her mood swings alarmed her guardians. In school for the first time, she struggled to learn to read.</p>
<p>Investigators arranged for her to speak to her parents. She told them she felt like a &#8220;nobody&#8221; working for the Ibrahims and wanted to come home. Her father yelled at her.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Three years ago, she broke off contact with her family. Since then she has refused to speak Arabic. She can no longer communicate in her mother tongue.</p>
<p>During the 2006 trial, the Ibrahims described Shyima as part of their family. They included proof of a trip she took with the family to Disneyland. Shyima&rsquo;s lawyer pointed out that the 10-year-old wasn&rsquo;t allowed on the rides &mdash; she was there to carry the bags.</p>
<p>The couple&rsquo;s lawyers collected photographs of the home where Shyima grew up, including close-ups of the feces-stained squat toilet and of Shyima&rsquo;s sisters washing clothes in a bucket.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The couple pleaded guilty to all charges, including forced labor and slavery. They were ordered to pay $76,000, the amount Shyima would have earned at the minimum wage. The sentence: Three years in federal prison for Ibrahim, 22 months for his wife, and then deportation for both. Their lawyers declined to comment for this story.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shyima was adopted last year by Chuck and Jenny Hall of Beaumont, Calif. The family lives near Disneyland, where they have taken her a half-dozen times. She graduated from high school this summer after retaking her exit exam and hopes to become a police officer.</p>
<p>Shyima, now 19, has a list of assigned chores. She wears purple eyeshadow, has a boyfriend and frequently updates her profile on MySpace. Her hands are neatly manicured.</p>
<p>But in her closet, she keeps a box of pictures of her parents and her brothers and sisters. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t look at them because it makes me cry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How could they? They&rsquo;re my parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>EPILOGUE: On a recent afternoon in Cairo, Madame Amal walked into the lobby of her apartment complex wearing designer sunglasses and a chic scarf.</p>
<p>After nearly two years in a U.S. prison cell, she&rsquo;s living once more in the spacious apartment where Shyima first worked as her maid. The apartment is adorned in the style of a Louis XIV palace, with ornately carved settees, gold-leaf vases and life-sized portraits of her and her husband.</p>
<p>She did not agree to be interviewed for this story.</p>
<p>Before the door closed behind her, a little girl slipped in carrying grocery bags. She wore a shabby T-shirt. Her small feet slapped the floor in loose flip-flops. Her eyes were trained on the ground.</p>
<p>She looked to be around 9 years old.</p>

		<p> Stories like these are astonishing. Blacks talk about the slavery that ended for them in 1862 as if it were only hours ago; demanding reperations, preferential treatment and an entire gambit of other goodies. To listen to them, only the whites are responsible for slavery the world over and only the whites should pay.<br>
 Yet the only people outraged by these stories is the white race.The only people working to stop it is the white race. Eventually, the constant accusation of  guilt, racism and the sheer amount of hatred spewed out by these people will wear down the tolerance, drive and caring of the white race and we will simply stop trying.</p>

		<p>No, no, no!  This can&rsquo;t be true!  We all know from watching television that it&rsquo;s only white people who enslave.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you remember the episode of LAW &amp; ORDER, SVU, where the waspy society matron has a little black slave girl scrubbing the marble floor of her foyer?  It&rsquo;s the same episode, I think, where the white art history professor spends vast amounts of money importing little African boys to murder in bizarre rituals.  And we all know that television crime shows would never depict anything that was not absolutely true to life.</p>
<p>For instance, remember the episode of Miami CSI, where the beautiful blonde jeweler has a secret basement dungeon workroom beneath her showroom, full of African children forced to work cutting blood diamonds?  Any diamond dealer in Antwerp, I&rsquo;m sure, will tell you that diamond cutting is a job frequently entrusted to eight-year-olds.</p>
<p>When Shyima&rsquo;s story becomes a movie, her part will have to be played by someone much darker.  The Ibrahims will have to become the Ingalls, a very blond Swedish family famed for producing a series of children&rsquo;s story books.</p>
<p>But one thing is for sure: these days, no matter what happens in the world, and no matter who is involved, white people will somehow end up being blamed.<br>

		<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think that there is any other term you could use than modern-day slavery,&#8221; said Bob Schoch&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh no, Sir.  This is the <i>old</i> slavery that has never gone away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet there are hundreds, if not thousands, of these kids in Beverly Hills alone.  And that&rsquo;s just from Persian and Arab households.  Indians practice the same slavery.</p>
<p>Forgive me for injecting a little coldness here&hellip;but why does Shyima get to stay in the United States?  Because she was adopted?&hellip;at 18 years old?  Should we let the tens of thousands of children brought here by their foreign &#8220;employers&#8221; stay here as well?  We&rsquo;ve got plenty of OUR OWN abused and neglected children to take care of.</p>
<p>Seems that Shyima&rsquo;s true mission in life is to stop slavery at its source:  Africa.</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of why we must STOP importing foreigners from non-Western, third-world countries.  But no doubt, there are plenty of &#8220;charities&#8221; out there that will insist on using this as an excuse to import more.</p>

		<p>The only reason the we in the White Western World get blamed for slavery is because we were the only one&rsquo;s dumb enough to admit that it was wrong in the first place. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t admit to guilt then you are not guilty. The merits of slavery as an insitution are nothing more than a matter of opinion. We Westerners tried and convicted ourselves of wrong doing. What&rsquo;s right and what&rsquo;s wrong is nothing more than a social norm. If abortion is ever outlawed again then abortionist will be condsidered murders, today it&rsquo;s as common as any other medical practice. Public opinion is the only thing that makes a difference.   </p>

		<p>The Arab/Muslim culture is founded on slavery.  Islam was little more than an invention for a merchant empire whose chief commodity was slaves.  It was a new marketing plan for transferring slaves from the south to the north and slaves from the north to the south.  That is why the Arab Expansion, as it is called, was less of a war than a sort of kidnapping of cities and reordering them - not that plenty of killing did not occur.</p>
<p>I have personal knowledge of families traveling in Morroco being offered money for their children.  I knew one German aupair in California who was being treated close to a slave by a couple from the Middle East.  She wasn&rsquo;t being beaten or treated as bad as this story portrays, but it was pretty outrageous treatment.</p>

		<p>Here in the UK I just finished watching the Ch4 documentary &#8216;Unreported World&rsquo; which this week featured Benin, a small West African country where voodoo is commonplace. The parents of children enrol them in voodoo training which is expensive and those that cannot pay forfeit their child to the voodoo &#8216;convent&rsquo; until such times as they can. If they can&rsquo;t then they remain owned for life by the voodoo &#8216;convent&rsquo;. Child slavery is widespread and agents operate like employment agencies would in the West, sending children to work for rich Africans in other African countries like Nigeria, (no Arabs involved here) where they work for a pittance and have no rights whatsoever. The agent showed no embarrassment whatsoever when describing how children were preferred over adults because they can be beaten whereas adults aren&rsquo;t so easy to control.</p>
<p>Slavery is still widespread in many non-Christian African countries where it is still accepted as a fact of life by most of the population. The continuing guilt trip for whites due to  their part in the slave trade is merely a tactic by the liberal elite and their African-American stooges like Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson to throw a smokescreen over the diabolical activities of African blacks concerning slavery, demonising whites in the process as they stake their claim for power over the white European race.</p>
<p>I am proud to be part of the white European people that abolished slavery worldwide.</p>

		<p>This is one of the other cultures that we are told to adore, cherish, respect, tolerate, and embrace. It&rsquo;s what the American people voted for. Get used to stories like child slavery, female circumcision, stoning women who were raped, and Sharia Law. It&rsquo;s here to stay and dominate the new America.</p>

<p>The practice is already widespread. Middle Easterners use smuggled narcotics to lure white females into sexual depravities in every Western city where there is a Middle Eastern community.  Channel 4 in Britain produced a documentary on this subject.  Google &#8216;rapes in Australia and Sweden&rsquo; as well.  Sexual slavery under the influence of narcotics is not uncommon to their culture.</p>

		<p>This is not your uncle&rsquo;s federal government buba.  Washington has been hijacked by criminals who have discovered that corruption and treason are the most profitable endeavors a politician can engage in today.</p>
<p>Washington considers us to be their slaves; therefore they support every conceivable type of slavery.  And as long as the general public continues to act like slaves they will be treated as such&hellip;       <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this sort of story before.  The freed slaves get U.S. citizenship.  I suppose that the Rulers in D.C. consider chattel slavery excellent training for membership in the new society they are building.  <br>
     In fairness, the courts ought to seize the assets of the convicted slave owners, pay their debts, and give the balance to the slaves before deporting them.  I&rsquo;m sure that the girl could live very well in any African country she chose with a couple hundred thousand, or maybe much more.  She could probably even afford to buy herself a ten year old or two to do the chores around the villa.  </p>
