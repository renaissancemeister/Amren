<h1>Labour: Tolerance Has Hampered Integration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NIS News Service, Dec. 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Labour (PvdA) appears to want to take a different direction regarding the integration of immigrants. In a new memorandum on the subject, the party urges confronting intolerance. &ldquo;The mistake that we should never again make is swallowing criticism of cultures or religions because of tolerance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The memorandum was drawn up by PvdA chairwoman Lilianne Ploumen, indicating it is a document from the entire party leadership including PvdA leader Wouter Bos. The memorandum, entitled &ldquo;Divided past, shared future,&rsquo; will be presented to the PvdA members at a congress next March and then, if adopted, become the new PvdA policy.</p>
<p>According to the party chairwoman, the government should no longer try to encourage integration by information campaigns. The government should only provide the conditions in which integration can take place by itself. On the one hand, the law must be maintained and on the other, opportunities must be offered to everyone via education, youth guidance and activating labour market policy.</p>
<p>Toleration has not done integration of migrants in the Netherlands any good, the memorandum concludes. The PvdA considers that in future, newcomers must opt for the Dutch society. &ldquo;We all speak Dutch, know the basic forms of behaviour and the democratic constitutional state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the PvdA wants to continue to tolerate headscarves in classrooms and mosques with an Arabic architecture. It will become somewhat stricter on wearing of burqas or refusing to shake hands with someone of the opposite sex; immigrants that do that should be told that it is abnormal in the Netherlands. Finally, there is a third category, setting explicit boundaries, under which the PvdA is thinking of female circumcision and violence to save damaged family honour.</p>
<p>Ploumen terms this three-prong policy norm-setting, confrontation or tolerance. In the past years, tolerance has been over-emphasised, including tolerance of behaviour that was actually not acceptable, the chairman says. In the memorandum, she also calls on Muslims not to take on a victim&rsquo;s role any more.</p>
<p>Ploumen gave an interview yesterday in De Volkskrant, traditionally a PvdA-minded medium. According to the paper, the PvdA sets out &ldquo;a friendly but strong vision.&rdquo; &ldquo;An iron fist in a velvet glove, beyond tolerance and cultural relativism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mistake we must never again make,&rdquo; says Ploumen in the interview, &ldquo;is choking back criticism of cultures or religions for the sake of tolerance.&rdquo; For a long time, it was thought that &ldquo;it would all eventually turn out well by itself.&rdquo; In practice, that meant looking away from problems. &ldquo;Feelings of loss and worry were suppressed. And (..) these feelings were not recognised by government and politicians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The theme has been dividing the PvdA, Ploumen acknowledges. &ldquo;Earlier reports identified the problems, but offered no solutions. There was no party view to guide local politicians. This there now is. ( &hellip; ) I assume that this resolution will get through at the congress in March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To De Volkskrant&rsquo;s question about whether the problems caused by children of Turkish or Moroccan parents are not actually already empathised too much, Ploumen answered: &ldquo;No. It is sometimes painful, but it is necessary. We do have to make progress now. After the confrontation, the ultimate goal is acceptance. That everyone can respect one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among migrants, 80 percent have dual nationality. Ploumen says the &ldquo;grip of countries of origin&rdquo; on immigrants &ldquo;must disappear.&rdquo; She considers that &ldquo;to become Dutch, you must in principle give up your old nationality.&rdquo; But at the same time &ldquo;loyalty (to the Netherlands) for me has nothing to do with nationality.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound very liberal. Forcing people to conform or else. Then again liberals aren&rsquo;t really all that liberal. They seem mostly about perversion and degrading people.</p>
<p> I wonder if this is one of those sleight of hand type of things. Where the &#8216;liberals&rsquo; send money and support to everyone who&rsquo;s not a white heterosexual male and then at the same time make rhetorical comments calling to heel members of their great experiment, when all they really want to do is rein in white members of the right. Isn&rsquo;t that usually how it works? There&rsquo;s a continuous assault against common sense, and then once every decade or so warn us that danger can come from other quarters too, in theory. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the Dutch have accepted Dutch liberalism, or really European marxism.  That religion got them into the immigration mess in the first place.  The africans and muslims come to Holland for money, not to become Dutch.  They can&rsquo;t become Dutch, they&rsquo;re africans and muslims.  Given the perversity of the marxist religion that dominates Europe, I can see why they wouldn&rsquo;t want to adapt to their new country.  But they still must be forced to leave.</p>

<p>Then this is nothing more than the same, silly French myth (adhered to like a religion) which holds that ANYBODY can be French if they just master the language and learn which wine goes with their fish. (Yes, I&rsquo;m being facaetious here, but basically that&rsquo;s the idea   &mdash;   that nationality is just a matter of cultural adjustment.) Indeed, it&rsquo;s a pretense that race and ethnicity do not exist   &mdash;   exactly as the Left preaches. It&rsquo;s the modern notion of the &#8220;Proposition Nation&#8221; being pushed by certain interested groups  that your nationality is no more than an address, the place where you live - no different than your ZIP code.</p>
<p>Therefore, any Fiji Islander or Australian aborigene or Papuan native could become a good Frenchman or Dutchman if he just sets his mind to it and studies his grammar book.  Race, however, is unmentionable.   </p>
<p>What blithering idiocy! And these are the fools who run our countries!</p>

<p><br>
Yes indeed, and that is also why they come to America   &mdash;    FOR MONEY!   &mdash;   not to enjoy &#8220;our democracy&#8221; or &#8220;our freedoms&#8221;,  as our sappy political leaders like to imagine.  Oh, maybe just  a few of them  (political refugees mainly)  may come here for that purpose, but the vast majority of them are &#8220;economic refugees&#8221; who are here simply for the money. Most of them  couldn&rsquo;t care less about our democracy or freedoms, and many are openly contemptuous of them.   Some (eg. Moslems) would eagerly replace them as soon as they can.  </p>
<p>I vividly remember a place where I once worked (a large and well known bank) which employes many West Indians. Some of them said openly and defiantly for all to hear that they didn&rsquo;t give a damn about the USA and were here for just one thing, and one thing only   &mdash;   the money.  I&rsquo;ll never forget it. </p>
<p>The same is doubtless true of all white, western countries:   they don&rsquo;t really like your culture; they don&rsquo;t like your way of life; they don&rsquo;t necessarily like you.   They just like your prosperity and want to share it.  But they fail to consider the who is golden goose that lays the wonderful eggs.  Otherwise, why couldn&rsquo;t they establish the same prosperity and orderliness in their own countries?  I recall a defiant statement made by some Turkish woman in Germany and quoted here on Amren a year or two ago:  <i>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not going anyplace!  We have everything we need right here.   What we don&rsquo;t need is YOU.&#8221; </i></p>

<p> Democratic constitutional state.  Too funny.  A 2/3rds vote against the EU Constitution resulted in a few backroom deals and the rapid ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.  The Dutch have had only 1 vote on things like immigration and the EU and the Ruling elite didn&rsquo;t like how that went so expect even fewer calls for voter input in the future.  </p>

<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa&hellip; back up a minute. </p>
<p>What do you mean <i>setting</i> explicit boundaries? Don&rsquo;t they already <i>HAVE</i> explicit boundaries concerning these things (I don&rsquo;t speak Dutch, but here in PA they&rsquo;re called laws)? </p>
<p>Am I to infer from this statement that the Dutch have ever previously allowed or, God forbid, tolerated this sort of barbarism on their soil? Please, tell me it ain&rsquo;t so.</p>

<p>I am not sure but it&rsquo;s forbidden in Europe generally. However, the Dutch offers free male genital mutilation to Muslim parents to have their children&rsquo;s healthy genitals cut off.</p>
<p>Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the famous Somali born Dutch feminist tried to make it forbidden, but I don&rsquo;t know the current situation in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>&gt; I had Dutch friends and lived in The Netherlands for a little while in the late 1990s.  Most Dutch people in my opinion are very complex and confused in their views and motivations.  When I was there they were still having a Liberation Day parade - &#8220;festival of flowers&#8221; and I saw a placard that read, &#8220;Thank you General Marshall.&#8221;  When we spoke of it, my friends explaned that these foreigners were needed to rebuild after the war because there was such a shortage of men.  After the work was done, it was difficult to send people who had started families while working in Holland back to where they  had come from.  It was not such a big deal then.  But by the time I was there, Morrocans for example would come there, work a little while and then receive permanent unemployment stipends.  They would smuggle drugs and who knows what else into The Netherlands.  The other thing is that The Netherlands port in Amsterdam is one of the busiest ports in the world and the little country makes huge amounts of income from that - as they always have.  The result is a social system that creates really rudderlesss people.  And I mean mentally touched, too. I met more than my share of neurotic Dutch people. </p>
<p>But they are often brilliant, too.  Some of the best engineers in the world are Dutch.</p>
<p>As for Marxism, the Dutch are decidedly socialist.  Partly, this is a reaction to Hitler and nationalism and partly it is due to the overwhelming wealth of such a small nation.  Historian Simon Schama wrote a book on this issue titled; &#8220;The Embarassment of Riches.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Being overconfident is a cultural habit of Northern Europe.  They don&rsquo;t grasp that they could loose their countries and themselves due to their philanthropic tendancies.</p>
<p>But I continue to hope that the Dutch and other Scandinavian nations will reclaim their right to their own language, culture and land.</p>

		<p>I think many of you are missing the point. Even Dutch liberals are getting back to their senses about reasonable nationalist policy. Read Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s latest article on the automaker bailout, and he says Bush is finally getting around to somewhat of an economic protectionist policy, while Europe and Asia have been subsidizing and protecting their economies for decades. The Dutch liberals are merely returning to reason.</p>

No argument from me! None at all.  But by that standard, you would have to confine a good part of Europe&rsquo;s reigning political aristocracy.<br>
