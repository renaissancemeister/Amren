<h1><a href="http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=77&amp;ContentID=113035">Muslims Plan $10m Enclave</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kim MacDonald, The West Australian (Perth), December 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Islamic community plans to build a Muslim-only housing development and recreation centre as part of a $10 million complex in Rivervale.</p>
<p>Islamic Council of WA spokesman Rahim Ghauri said the group had an architect-designed concept plan for a six-storey housing development, an underground carpark and a hall for weddings, conferences and religious and recreational activities.</p>
<p>Mr Ghauri rejected claims the housing would further isolate sectors of the Muslim community from mainstream society, claiming the venue would be used to teach Islamic youth how to become good Australian citizens.</p>
<p>And the council&rsquo;s religious adviser, Abdul Jalil Ahmad, said it was useful for different religious or ethnic groups to have separate residential enclaves so their customs and exotic cooking smells did not offend neighbours.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s ideal for any ethnic group because you can deal with each other in an easier way,&#8221; Mr Ahmad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In South Africa, because of apartheid, all different communities were set up and it worked well. It kept people separate. We can be together in terms of our contribution to the wider community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Jalil, who once tried to set up a sharia court in WA to settle disputes in the Muslim community through an incorporated body, plans to live in the 20-unit complex on the community&rsquo;s 1280sqm Malvern Street block.</p>
<p>Mr Rahim said it would provide affordable housing for Muslims and be first-stop accommodation for Islamic students and newcomers to help integrate them into society.</p>
<p>The group wants donations from &#8220;generous Muslims&#8221; locally and all over the world for the complex and so far had $100,000. He declined to reveal who was approached but said all donations would be declared to the Government.</p>
<p>The council hoped to buy neighbouring vacant land from Landcorp to extend the development, possibly with offices, another carpark and sporting facilities.</p>
<p>Mr Rahim said WA&rsquo;s Muslim community was one of the only religious groups which did not have its own recreation centre. It would offer to rent the hall to non-Muslims.</p>
<p>He said the inclusion of units was necessary to pass local planning laws but the council would include the Muslim-only housing block even if it was forced to move to another area.</p>
<p>Ethnic Communities Council president Ramdas Sankaran supported the development of a Muslim recreation hall but said a separate housing complex for any religious or ethnic group was a &#8220;deplorable&#8221; idea because it undermined social cohesion and promoted segregation.</p>
<p>He said there was an argument for separate aged-care facilities based on race or religion, but building a general housing complex for families set a dangerous precedent which he believed would not have support in the Muslim or broader communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Self exclusion is just as bad as being excluded by other parties in Australia. It&rsquo;s not in the interests of any group,&#8221; Mr Sankaran said.</p>
<p>Belmont mayor Glenys Godfrey had informal talks with the group but a council spokesman said it could not comment until it saw the plans.<br>

		<p>Good, let them live apart.  Assimilation today, isn&rsquo;t what many White folks think it is.  It is no longer about some Irish and French and English all mixing together.  In fact, European descended peoples are all closely related genetically anyway so there is no real mixing when they assimilate.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re being told that we have to assimilate genetically different people.  This isn&rsquo;t assimilation; it&rsquo;s genocide. </p>

<p>Good!</p>
<p>I like to read about various foreign cultures like this one and those south of the border retaining their traditions and cultures, because that will keep up the disunification process that is so necessary to complete break up into secessionist movements here as well as Australia. <br>

		<p>If they want a Muslim enclave, then they would be best off leaving Australia and moving to a country like Saudi Arabia. But since residents of Muslim nations are flooding en masse to the West, it&rsquo;s obvious that Muslim segregation doesn&rsquo;t produce good results for anyone.</p>

They&rsquo;re still going to demand that Australians conform to their way of life. After all, when they venture out, they don&rsquo;t want to be offended by non-muslims.</p>

		<p>As an &#8220;escaped&#8221; ex-South African now living in great Spain, Australia was one of the rabid anti-Apartheid countries.  Now thay are contemplating adopting Apartheid themselves?   At least it will be a legal example that can be used elsewhere to separate the radicals from the Western systems, but thy must still pay taxes and obey Australina laws.   No: big trouble if it is allowed.   Send them back to where they came from now.</p>

<p>As usual, it takes a &#8220;protected minority&#8221; to state the bleeding obvious.  Mr. Ahmad, that&rsquo;s why they invented <i>countries</i>, sir.  </p>
<p>This is the sort of thing that has neoconartists up in arms, bemoaning the loss of &#8220;cohesion&#8221;, even as that loss is directly traceable to policies they themselves grant blind devotion to.  </p>
<p>The rest of us should be pleased with the development as it&rsquo;ll help us make the point that tensions obviously dissipate the farther antagonistic &#8220;communities&#8221; remove themselves from one another, building on top of this a case for more robust and permanent forms of separation, ideally in cooperation with (a) the rest of the (white) &#8220;Anglosphere&#8221; and (b) the rest of Europe.  </p>
<p>Perfectly pointless (and worse, fruitless) would be to wail about immigrant groups like the above &#8220;carving out&#8221; territory for themselves.  Their presence has provided an unintended but invaluable lesson, and it is much more useful to focus on this.</p>

<p>Islam is not a religion of peace.  Islam is not a religion at all.  Islam is a demonic cult.  The Koran is not a holy book.  The Koran is the Book of Satan that ensues conquest, murder, rape and the total acquiescence of ones soul to evil incarnate.</p>

Sorry to tell you, Bill, but they  have &#8216;em to!  And they are often prominent in business and politics.  </p>
<p>However, I am unaware that they make any special demands for themselves, at least not at this stage of settlement. They seem to keep a generally low profile. Hindus and Chinese too. Unlike Northern European countries, which pride themselves on their diversity and tolerance, Hispanic culture is heavily (and semi-officially) Catholic and not known for being too tolerant, so other groups wisely don&rsquo;t provoke it.</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>Islam in Argentina constitutes approximately 1.5% of the population, or an estimated 500,000-600,000 (93% Sunni).   Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America, serving Argentina&rsquo;s Muslim community.  According to one survey, there are around &hellip;1,000,000 speakers of North Levantine Spoken Arabic.&#8221;</i></p>
<p> <i>&#8220;In 1988 the construction of the mosque of Santiago de Chile was initiated.  It was finished in 1989 and was inaugurated by a prince of Malaysia in 1996. The Muslim Chilean population was increased by Pakistani businessmen seeking luck in the country.<br>
 <br>
By end of the 1980s many indigenous Chileans converted to Islam, which increased after completion of the mosque.  In 1997 Pakistani retailers purchased land for the construction of the Bilal Mosque and madrasa in Iquique, which was completed in 1999.&#8221;</i>   [Wiki]</p>

		<p>Muslims use their people and money to go to all corners of the earth to take over a nation and the people of that nation are turned over to these evil people without firing a shot to defend their freedoms. Corrupe politians have sold white christians our to such an evil as Islam-for money. I hope they are the first to be beheaded, because the muslims know a person who betrayes his own will betray them. That is the only up side </p>
