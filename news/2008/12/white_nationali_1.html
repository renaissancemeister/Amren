<h1>White Nationalists Prepare to Oppose Obama Administration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Ward, Imagine 2050, December 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Republican Party is in disarray after its loss to Barack Obama, and on the sidelines white nationalists are skillfully preparing political attacks on the new American president.</p>
<p>Since the weeks leading up to the most significant elections ever to take place in the United States, federal law enforcement agencies, the media and human rights organizations have paid close attention to threats made against Presidential-Elect Barack Obama. Some of these threats have been made by individuals with ties to the neo-Nazi movement in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However it is beyond the graffiti, intimidation, and harassment that the far right is building its true power. With Republican leadership engaged in an internal power struggle to control the party apparatus, extremist factions within the party are seeking to strengthen their influence while more extreme external organizations hope that the current political vacuum will allow them to increase the influence of white nationalism in the American body politic.</p>
<p>While some factions like The Eagle&rsquo;s Forum, The National Rifle Association, and Team America Political Action Committee have enter the politically charged minefield to control the Republican Party, other organizations like The Constitution Party, John Birch Society and the overtly anti-Semitic American Free Press hope that they will be able to create a third alternative to the current two party system. Regardless of the differences, what each faction shares is the belief that waging political attacks against President Obama will allow them to both undermine the incoming administration and grow their membership.</p>
<p>Political attacks on Obama began immediately after the last vote was cast. On December 1st and again on the 3rd a group called We the People Foundation ran full page ads in the Chicago Tribune questioning Obama&rsquo;s citizenship. {snip}</p>
<p>This particular attack on Obama is part of a larger tendency within the American far right to dismantle the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. {snip}</p>
<p>Under the guise of &#8220;controlling immigration&#8221;, the far right Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), the most influential anti-immigrant group in the United States, has stated publicly that one of its top goals for the next federal legislative session is to restrict the 14th Amendment. The Federation for American Immigration Reform was founded by John Tanton, a conservationist and retired ophthalmologist. FAIR has received 1.2 million dollars (U.S.) from the &#8220;racial science&#8221; foundation the Pioneer Fund. FAIR has many associations with political extremists including white nationalists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While FAIR prepares to fuel bigotry by attacking immigrants and civil rights the National Rifle Association (NRA) has sought to sow fear and suspicion of a multi-racial democracy amongst whites by claiming that Obama has plans to pass laws that will allow the government to confiscate their guns. While these rumors are completely unfounded it has served to grow the ranks of the NRA. {snip}</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly hate violence is on the rise according to the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. The victims &mdash; Jewish, black, homosexual, and immigrant &mdash; are innocents in an environment created by white nationalists out to undermine the Obama presidency at any cost. A successful black presidency undercuts the bigoted arguments of white nationalists and affirms the possibility of a multiracial civil society &mdash; one where &#8220;the content of a person&rsquo;s character means more than the color of their skin.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I want to believe there is some grain of truth in this hateful article that the far right is attempting to takeover the Republican Party.  I&rsquo;ve just about had it with the party and the neoconservative mouthpieces.  We&rsquo;ll see the direction they take when they nominate the new RNC Chairman sometime in the next few weeks.  If its Michael Steele, then its business as usual and I will then switch my registration to Independent.  </p>

		<p>Setting aside the fact that there is not a truthful sentence in the entire article, I find the claims of NRA bigotry to be as hysterical as they are mendacious. Although I am a member, I have long taken issue with the NRA&rsquo;s abject cowardice with regard to straight-talk on the issue of race and so-called &#8220;gun&#8221; or &#8220;street&#8221; crime. </p>
<p>Of course I don&rsquo;t expect the NRA to take a &#8220;pro-white&#8221; stance, but I would certainly like them to tell the truth, or at least acknowledge just where and by whom the bulk of violent crime involving firearms in the US is committed. Remove the Black(and increasingly Hispanic)crime statistics involving firearms, and the whole picture of just how &#8220;safe&#8221; America really is compared to other nations(despite the large number of privately owned guns)changes drmatically. <br>
This fact is critical to the greater second-ammendment battle&hellip;and the NRA won&rsquo;t touch it with a ten-foot pole!!</p>
<p>What a laughably stupid article&hellip;<br>

		<p>Obama is not a US Citizen and should not be sworn in as President.  Swearing in a non-citizan as President in violation of the Constitution makes the US Constitution nul and void.  The Government becomes illegitimate and illegal in the eyes of the community of nations.  The Russian Government has state this in Pravda.</p>

		<p>I read as much as I could stand of this drivel, mostly because I wanted to find out who these evil White Nationalist groups were so I could run out and join them, but I didn&rsquo;t see a single &#8220;neo-Nazi&#8221; or White Nationalist group mentioned anywhere in the article. That&rsquo;s not too surprising, though, since there is no &#8220;White Nationalist movement&#8221; in the United States.</p>
<p>The groups this guy talks about are just center-right to right paleo-con, neo-con or mainstream Stupid Party organizations. I suppose the John Birch Society could be called &#8220;far right&#8221; in the Constitutionalist, anti-Communist sense, but the Birchers have been obsolete for years and they were never particularly racist even in their heyday. The American Free Press is just a news magazine as far as I know  &mdash;  not an organization. The Eagle Forum and National Rifle Association are mainstream lobbying groups, safely politically correct, and probably qualify as neo-conservative these days. None of these groups is anything close to being White Nationalist, let alone neo-Nazi. If the mouth-breather who wrote this article thinks the Eagle Forum is a white nationalist group, he doesn&rsquo;t have a clue about the Right in this country.</p>
<p>Liberals are just as ignorant about White Nationalism as they are about everything else and they especially don&rsquo;t understand anything about National Socialism. To them, you&rsquo;re a &#8220;Nazi&#8221; if you voted for John McCain. This idea that white nationalist groups are scheming to take over the Republican Party and fomenting a wave of &#8220;hate violence&#8221; across the country is completely laughable. There is no white nationalist movement in this country. It doesn&rsquo;t exist. </p>
<p>As for the neo-Nazis, the so-called American Nazi Party has about three members, all Federal informants, and they spend all their time flaming each other on transient web-forums and breaking off into splinter groups that never actually do anything except occasionally dress up in uniforms and march around in circles, chanting &#8220;Heil!&#8221; in a Free Speech Zone surrounded by cops and hundreds of ARA kiddies wearing women&rsquo;s clothes. Russia has real neo-Nazis. So does Germany. American has &#8220;costume clowns.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we ever do get a real white nationalist group in this country, the liberals will never see it coming.</p>

<p>They want to increase their influence?  Oh, no they don&rsquo;t, old Hoss.  Boy, you&rsquo;re really out-of-touch aren&rsquo;t you?  The far right wants the present economic situation to continue on until the US collapses, then they intend to fight for whatever territory they can get in a Mad Max type scenario.</p>
<p>Even many of us on the near right are fed up with the establishment parties and believe this country is dysfunctional in its present form.</p>
<p>The economy is imploding all around this leftie and the one worry uppermost in his mind is that the far right might influence the Republicans more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for a laugh to read, but it&rsquo;s amazing anyone is so dense he places matters of little consequence ahead of problems that could well sink the country for good.</p>
<p>The leftist mind is a sight to behold.  Amazing.</p>

<p>Of all the lies, half truths and distortions in this article, this one if the worst. Even according to the warped government stats (which lists Hispanics as &#8220;white&#8221; if they commit a hate crime and as &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; if they are victims) blacks are twice as likely to commit hate violence. As we see on AR, much of the anti-Jewish, anti-immigrant and anti-gay violence is committed by blacks, but this angle is hidden by the corporate media. </p>
<p>Of course, not that Imagine 2050 cares, almost all interracial violence between blacks and whites is black on white. But you&rsquo;ll only read that on AR and a few other dissident sites. That&rsquo;s why they want to censor us.</p>

		<p>Anyone who says anything against or in criticism of the Elected One ought to be investigated and held up to ridicule.  Take their jobs, give them to our people (Blacks), retaining the work we did as slaves for Hispanics.  It is only neccessary to bail out the Cadillac producing arm of GM.  (What a savings).  The Elected One is a fulfillment of that revolutionary song &#8220;We Shall Overcome,&#8221; which was aimed at the White repressors.  Today, there is one choice, be assimilated - genetically overcome, or face a growing soical and political isolation.  Repatriate - deport Whites back to England and Germany and help those economies.  In that way, America can finally become the aquarian backwater that Europe always intended it to be.  Who can complain when the master is himself Black?</p>

<p>&gt; Don&rsquo;t write that in France, it is a crime to even give the existence of race a mention.  They are proving race doesn&rsquo;t exist by voting a Black woman Miss France.  Of course, they don&rsquo;t notice that she is black.  But enough on the issue of beta-carotene deficiency.</p>
<p>As long as Obama&rsquo;s critics have a factual issue, it is completely legitimate to criticize him or any government official.  What troubles me a lot more than a few Jew haters is all the leftists who cannot see their own fascism in their interpretation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>What bigoted arguments?  The arguments that something should be done about grossly disproportionate black on white crime, social acceptance of discrimination against white people, or taxing white people to pay for minority children whose parents can&rsquo;t support them?  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how a successful black presidency would in any way undercut the force of our arguments or the legitimacy of our concerns.  </p>

		<p>This is not a news story: it&rsquo;s a prepared piece of propaganda using every smear and insinuation to delegitimize any criticism of Obama and the Left&rsquo;s agenda.  It&rsquo;s really a preemptive assault, like a press release from the SPL.  The EU has masterfully conducted affairs by filing the European press with such non-stories.  Nothing is being reported - there is no what, where, when, why.  The NY Times has been publishing these &#8220;trend&#8221; pieces for years as a way to influence opinion and &#8220;change attitudes.&#8221;  Dissecting its content would be a waste of time.  John Birch Society will take over the GOP?  Ha!  &#8220;Hate crimes&rsquo; on the rise?  Please.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s unsurprising that the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights would make this claim. What really matters is whether the data support it.</p>
<p>&#8220;A successful black presidency undercuts the bigoted arguments of white nationalists and affirms the possibility of a multiracial civil society &mdash; one where &ldquo;the content of a person&rsquo;s character means more than the color of their skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amusing, coming one day after B. Hussein Obama proclaimed affirmative action &#8220;absolutely necessary.&#8221; AA does not depend upon the &#8220;content of one&rsquo;s character.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, why is Mr. Ward more concerned about the National Rifle Association  &mdash;  a group with no racial ideology at all  &mdash;  than about the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Council of La Raza, or dozens of other non-white racialist advocacy groups? </p>

		<p>  The liberals will never be satisfied. Actually, the true conservatives need to disband the republican party and start over. No neo-cons allowed to apply. Send them to the democrats. Right, wrong, or something in between, the white nationalists have a right to believe the way they wish. If they can develop a strong party, have at it. Hate violence is on the rise, alright. It is violence against whites by minorities. It is violence amongst minorities. </p>

		<p>The next couple of years will be very interesting indeed. With our economy collapsing, our culture under attack, and safety on the line, many whites will start to wake up. The Republican party knows that almost all of its base is conservative whites. It may only take a handful of senators or congressman to stand up for our people to make our movement mainstream.Sometimes I have hope and sometimes I think our cause is lost. We are running out of time to bring this struggle to the front lines. It may take another David Duke type to run for office for this to happen. It&rsquo;s hard to stand by and do nothing but few are willing to risk their jobs and safety to fight. An economic collapse, which is sure to bring minority riots, may be a blessing in disguise.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In reality, far from curbing immigration ending the 14th Amendment would effectively reverse major gains of the black civil rights and women&rsquo;s rights.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wrong; ending the 14th Amendment would prevent &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; of illegal aliens from getting automatic U.S. citizenship! His statement is false, and I don&rsquo;t see him using anything to back it up. </p>
<p>Here is his profile: http://imagine2050.newcomm.org/author/ericward/</p>
<p>I think he has a reason to be biased; and he apparently hates &#8220;Whitey,&#8221; possibly in favor of a Black alliance, with Hispanics and hardline feminists, against Whites. This sneaky attempt failed to provide evidence! </p>
<p>He also gives FAIR the image of a &#8220;scary White Nationalist &amp; Supremacist&#8221; organization! This is an inappropriate and unfair comparison. FAIR is not a race-based organization!</p>
<p>His article also indicates a high level of unwarranted paranoia, nonetheless. </p>

<p>There is talk that the entire US mortgage industry will have to be nationalized sometime in the next 12 to 18 months.  If that happens we will have price controls on housing prices.  And with bureaucratic efficiency that leads to standard uniform housing prices for all units, be they 2,000 square feet or 6,000 square feet.  Maybe Mr. Obama will morph into an America Mugabe.  We will see.  2009 doesn&rsquo;t look like it will be any more fun than 2008.  Me thinks that Mr. Eric Ward needs to get a real job. </p>

Whites better begin to start thinking about a final secession movement from this declining Marxist red nation run by all of the above whiners before its too late and that day is rapidly approcahing.<br>
We could leave the traitor George Bushes and all his elitists behind with the current screwed up mutt nation since they are the root cause of the problem. </p>

Since it&rsquo;s impossible to disagree with a black man without being racist, this analysis fits perfectly into the psyche of brainwashed americans. </p>

That Obama can&rsquo;t possibly cure our ills in one, two, even four years, is a given.

		<p><i>&hellip; the National Rifle Association (NRA) has sought to sow fear and suspicion of a multi-racial democracy amongst whites by claiming that Obama has plans to pass laws that will allow the government to confiscate their guns. While these rumors are completely unfounded it has served to grow the ranks of the NRA.</i></p>
<p>First off, I&rsquo;m am a member of the NRA and I get all of the countless mailers they send out (which usually amount to extravagant ways of asking me to donate money I don&rsquo;t have, but I digress). Absolutely nothing in any of them that so much as addresses a &#8220;multi-racial democracy,&#8221; let alone sows &#8220;fear and suspicion&#8221; of one. Race is not the NRA&rsquo;s bag. It&rsquo;s not what they do. They&rsquo;re focus is solely on gun owners&rsquo; rights and the second amendment. They blast -no pun intended- any politician who supports gun control laws. This is certainly not limited to blacks, or even Democrats (they&rsquo;ve been highly critical of Republican NYC mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, as well John McCain and many others).</p>
<p>Secondly, fears of new firearm restrictions and/or confiscation coming from the new administration are hardly unfounded. Obama&rsquo;s record on the rights of gun owners is an abysmal one. He has:</p>
<p>Supported the wholly unconstitutional D.C. gun ban.</p>
<p>Overriding state purchasing laws with federal ones (federally mandated waiting periods, and alike).</p>
<p>Handgun registration; the necessary first step in confiscation.</p>
<p>Outlawing gun shops within a certain distance of schools (I&rsquo;ve heard different numbers, ranging from 1 mile to 5, but either way it would effectively close every gun shop in hundreds of small towns across the country).</p>
<p>Renewing the so-called &#8220;assault&#8221; weapons ban, which would include most semi-automatic rifles.</p>
<p>And my personal favorite, which I addressed in <a>this thread</a>, while in the Illinois senate he voted to allow towns and cities to prosecute people who used legally owned firearms to defend their own homes.</p>
<p>The NRA and AmRen do have one notable trait in common: they are far more often maligned than refuted. You can throw inflammatory words around all you like but the facts are there. Barack Obama will be a staunch opponent, if not enemy, of law abiding gun owners in this country (the criminal ones are still OK, though). Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t even need the NRA to tell me that. </p>

<p>On the other hand, Whites had better start organizing if they don&rsquo;t want to have everything taken away from them or be made miserable by tyrannical racial overlords who will be fully supported by their fellow traitorous whites.  </p>
<p>The biggest obstacle we have to even continue existing is our own fellow whites.  Those who stroke themselves and consider themselves morally superior to white people who would dare to defend themselves by legal means.  Or those whites that go along with the flow and knowingly turn the screws on their own people in favor or minorities, so that they can continue getting paid.  </p>
<p>We are not going to last much longer on this planet unless we do have some big changes in attitude.  Clearly, whites did not act this way in the past or none of us would be here.  </p>

		<p>On occasion I come across something I must send out: In a speech at Harvard last November, Harvard physicist John Holden, President-elect Obama&rsquo;s choice to be his science adviser as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, presented a &#8220;top 10&#8221; list of warming solutions. </p>
<p>Topping the list was &#8220;limiting population,&#8221; as if man was a plague upon the earth. This is a major tenet of green dogma that bemoans the fact that the pestilence called mankind comes with cars, factories and overconsumption of fossil fuels and other resources. </p>
<p>R. Timothy Patterson, professor of geology and director of the Ottawa-Carleton Geoscience Centre of Canada&rsquo;s Carleton University, says: &#8220;I and the first-class scientists I work with are consistently finding excellent correlations between the regular fluctuations of the sun and earthly climate. This is not surprising. The sun and the stars are the ultimate source of energy on this planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, a look at a graph of solar irradiance from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows little solar activity during the Little Ice Age and significant activity during recent times. </p>
<p>&hellip;.I wonder if the &#8220;limiting population&#8221; types that will have power in Obama&rsquo;s admin are aware of how menacing they sound. I can feel the tremors of separatism growing daily. I wonder if the Russian Igor Panarin is correct. The real question gets down to cost v benefits; considering how much the midwest is being dragged down by the coastal, ethnic enclave, and mega-urban politics of the rest of the country a reversion to Canada make more and more sense. And now this obnoxious comment.</p>

		<p>The economy is so scary out there, I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;m one of the 80 + percent of Americans counting on Obama to fix the problem. There was an article saying people are counting on Obama because they don&rsquo;t want to see America fail. The media claims Obama is also a symbol, and stands for something larger. </p>
<p>An earlier AmRen poster said something interesting about that, &#8220;If you criticize Obama and are White, you must be a White Nationalist. Questioning his qualifications during the election brought accusations of racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a good summary of the last 40 or 50 years? The most insane depravity and backwardness justified, no, exalted, simply by claiming opposition to it is &#8216;racist&rsquo; etc. We see the results. Decline by almost every measurable statistic going on 40 years now. Of course most people are too young and/or too brainwashed to even be aware of the difference. I don&rsquo;t let the far far-right &#8216;organizations&rsquo; off the hook either. Sometimes it seems as if they are simply more paid members of team-diversity. Gotta cover all the bases. AmRen excluded of course. The sad part is they probably don&rsquo;t even need to be paid to do it. All in a good cause and with the best intentions of course. After all, the only ones who resist all this progress and enlightenment are evil and &#8216;racist&rsquo;.  </p>

<p>This is correct, although I wouldn&rsquo;t say so in Germany.  Russia has a real skinhead movement going on simply because they have room to maneuver.  The government and police aren&rsquo;t as powerful over there, plus they have a lot of sympathizers both in the government as well as the population.  If the conditions in Russia were to ever happen in the United States, maybe we&rsquo;ll see some progress.</p>
<p>The really serious white activists mostly follow the lone wolf doctrine, which is basically acting alone or in a small cell of trusted friends, with no recruiting what-so-ever.  The majority of the skinheads from White Aryan Resistance and other groups now follow this doctrine, so we literally have tens of thousands of lone wolves who are waiting for the opportune moment to being open activity. </p>

<p>If Obama&rsquo;s citizenship is open to question, there&rsquo;s certainly nothing wrong in requiring legal confirmation of his eligibility to hold the highest office in the land. The author suggests that this is only being looked into because Mr. Obama is not fully white! </p>
<p>Then Mr. Ward tells us that controlling immigration is only a &#8216;guise.&rsquo; There really is no immigration issue for any American-born citizen to worry about! If you&rsquo;re worried about immigration, you&rsquo;re an &#8216;extremist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His concluding remarks are interesting for two reasons: (1) They acknowledge the fact that a multiracial society has YET to be demonstrated good and sustainable, and (2) They reveal the author&rsquo;s strong desire for a future America with only a remnant of white people in the population.</p>
<p>The whole premise of his article is that America will be a better place when Whites are no long running things in the country they founded. Life will be so much better when the New America looks just like the New South Africa (except perhaps even more diverse)!</p>

		<p>My, my, my, how typical this analysis from a leftist is.</p>
<p><i>Since the weeks leading up to the most significant elections <br>
ever to take place in the United States&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Hmmm, Obama hasn&rsquo;t sat in the White House for one stinking day and already the writer is confident that this election is more significant than Reagan&rsquo;s defeat of Mondale, Truman&rsquo;s upset victory over Dewey, or any other presidential election.  Why could this be?  Because Obama is a mulatto, of course.  It&rsquo;s funny how the left pretends it wants to get beyond race but clearly sees race as of more significance than any of the actual policies or capabilities of the candidates.  The Democratic primary race was certainly entertaining.  There was scarcely any difference in the policies or programs of Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama.  It all came down to whether it was more important to have a woman or a black as president.  At least in the Republican primary there was a real choice   &mdash;   one could choose peace, limited government, and the Constitution (Ron Paul), or war, a shredded Bill of Rights, and more big government (any of the others).  Of course 90% of the members of the Stupid Party voted for the latter.</p>
<p><i>Under the guise of &ldquo;controlling immigration&rdquo;, the far right Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), the most influential anti-immigrant group in the United States, has stated publicly that one of its top goals for the next federal legislative session is to restrict the 14th Amendment.</i></p>
<p>The 14th Amendment was intended to ensure that freed slaves and their descendants would be American citizens.  It was never intended to provide citizenship to millions of babies born to illegal immigrants, and in the process make their parents effectively undeportable.  FAIR is a mainstream organization that wants to lower immigration levels to protect American jobs and the environment.  That is now considered to be a &#8220;far right&#8221; position.</p>
<p><i>Political attacks on Obama began immediately after the last vote was cast.</i></p>
<p>So?  Political attacks from the left on Reagan began immediately after the last vote in 1980 was cast (actually, well before the last vote was cast).</p>
<p><i>&hellip;the National Rifle Association (NRA) has sought to sow fear and suspicion of a multi-racial democracy amongst whites by claiming that Obama has plans to pass laws that will allow the government to confiscate their guns</i></p>
<p>Obama is a big fan of gun control.  I do not know if he will go so far as to try to confiscate people&rsquo;s guns, but if he doesn&rsquo;t it will no doubt be more because of a pragmatic realization that that program won&rsquo;t get past Congress than any real desire to uphold the 2nd Amendment.</p>
<p><i>Unsurprisingly hate violence is on the rise according to the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.</i></p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard of this &#8220;Leadership Conference on Civil Rights&#8221; but if they&rsquo;re as reliable as the SPLC their claims are no reason to get your knickers in a knot.  I am confident that there will continue to be many more assaults of whites perpetrated by blacks than the other way around.</p>

		<p>People, drivel like the above article is nothing new.  I&rsquo;ve been reading stuff like it for years.  There is one, singular, overriding reason why WN will NEVER take over either of the two major parties in this country:</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t possess the financial reserves (i.e. the money) our enemies have.  That means we are effectively shut out from any of the major media outlets (which are owned, lock, stock and barrel by our enemies).  If you don&rsquo;t have regular access to the boob tube, you can forget about winning the hearts and minds of the Great Unwashed.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;neo Nazi movement&#8221;?  You mean, there&rsquo;s an actual &#8220;Movement&#8221; of &#8220;neo-Nazis&#8221; in America? And just WHO make up this &#8220;movement&#8221;?  Well, Jared Taylor is supposedly a &#8220;neo-Nazi&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ve even heard economist Lew Rockwell labeled a &#8220;neo-Nazi.&#8221;  I suppose if you claim everyone who is not in line with the Liberal/Leftist saint-hood is a &#8220;neo-Nazi&#8221; then there really IS a &#8220;movement,&#8221; right?</p>

		<p>&#8220;But of course straight white Christian males cannot be victims. They can only be perpetrators. White blood is being spilled every day by those so-called &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; blacks, gays and immigrants but Mr. Ward doesn&rsquo;t even consider this worthy of mention. Shame on him&#8221;.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you mean to say, &#8220;White blood is being spilled every day by those so-called &#8220;Victim&#8221; blacks, gays and immigrants&hellip;</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a more accurate assessment of what Eric Ward really says?</p>

		<p>I must admit that I was not aware of this extreme form of leftist, multi-cult madness; to claim that any white person who is either an NRA member, sympathizer, or in any way involved in the movement to halt the massive illegal immigration into the country, FAIR for instance which has absolutely no racial content whatsoever, is effectively a skin head, neonazi is the most bizzare thing I have ever read; is this fool serious?  if so, the left has truly redefined itself as the most extreme, least accurate movement to ever arise in American politics.</p>

<p>Congressman Tom Tancredo gave an anti-immigration speech in Washington. Two &#8216;Nazi&rsquo;s&rsquo; in full WW2 uniforms showed up to &#8216;support&rsquo; his speech. It was pretty obvious they weren&rsquo;t Nazi&rsquo;s at all but leftists working on their agenda. I&rsquo;m not a Nazi, though I&rsquo;ve been called one before, but I have to wonder if the mainstream media is on a quest to turn us all into Nazi sympathizers, with the way they cover the news. I&rsquo;ve also been called gay before, even though I&rsquo;m not gay, but perhaps they are working on some kind of gay agenda too. Perhaps it&rsquo;s all part of a divide and rule manifesto.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Political attacks on Obama began immediately after the last vote was cast.  On December 1st and again on the 3rd a group called We The People Foundation ran full page ads in the Chicago Tribune questioning Obama&rsquo;s citizenship.&#8221;   <br>
    Obviously Eric Ward is so clueless and out of touch with reality that he didn&rsquo;t know Obama&rsquo;s citizenship was questioned long before Dec 1st.  Way back in August Phil Berg who is a big shot lawyer for the DNC filed the first law suit concerning Obama&rsquo;s citizenship and over a dozen more big names such as Alan Keyes have joined in ever since. <br>
     As far as the NRA goes all they have done concerning Obama is to alert people to his anti-gun record which speaks for itself and can be verified by a thousand sources for all to see and once anyone researches Obama&rsquo;s record they can find out for themselves that Obama will be the worse anti-gun president we ever had.  Anybody that states &#8220;people that use guns to protect their families and property during a home invasion should be prosecuted&#8221; ( Obama )  has serious issues in the head.  <br>
     Irresponsible writing and downright lies like in the above article designed to keep the hate going between race and party lines is what should be prosecuted.  One possible explanation for such behavior can be found by going to this URL.  <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=56494" rel="nofollow"><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=56494" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId;=56494</a></a></p>

		<p>The refuse which substantially makes up the &#8216;right wing&rsquo; is, and has been for quite some time, full of cowardly, effeminate, situation ethics proponents, and traitors in the true sense of the word. </p>
<p>White Nationalists are few and far between. The assorted members claiming such distinctions are, for the most part, hangers on, and retirement age provocateurs. White Nationalism has deep roots, but the professional grade leadership has been non-existent; what the future holds is anybody&rsquo;s guess.</p>
<p>White Nationalism will gain momentum, but trust only those who have already proved their worth &#8216;within&rsquo; this community, not from any existing structure.</p>
