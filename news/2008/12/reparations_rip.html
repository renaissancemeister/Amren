<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just a few years ago, at roughly the turn of the millennium, slavery reparations seemed the coming thing. {snip}</p>
<p>Then: nothing. Today, reparations seem to have completely disappeared from the national agenda. Few mention them any more. What happened?</p>
<p>The idea of reparations for blacks had briefly come up at the time of the Civil War and Emancipation, but then was largely forgotten until the heady year of 1969, when it burst forth again. Black militants, led by James Forman, began disrupting Sunday services in leading churches and demanding a down payment of $500 million on future reparations. Much earnest discussion ensued: {snip}.</p>
<p>The brouhaha soon died down, but it inspired liberal Yale law professor Boris Bittker to write The Case for Black Reparations, a book that appeared in 1973 and remains well worth a look 35 years later.{snip}</p>
<p>For Bittker, it made sense to pursue reparations not through litigation but through legislation funded from government revenues. And in the years that followed, the U.S. in a way did just that, with a vast increase in spending on social welfare, education, housing, and urban programs, which aimed primarily at relieving the problem of black poverty, though they didn&rsquo;t make race a prerequisite for eligibility. On top of that spending, the nation enacted entitlement programs that were explicitly compensatory and race-based, including race-conscious student assignment in public schools, systematic racial preferences in employment and higher education, and much more.</p>
<p>By the time reparations enthusiasm hit the law schools in a major way during the late eighties, the old-school liberalism of professors like Bittker had given way to the newer deconstructionist vogue of critical legal studies and its even more radical successor, critical race theory, which infused the study of law with a heavy dose of identity politics and which viewed all the legislated help for blacks as woefully insufficient. Over the next decade, critical race theory made reparations one of its signature causes; indeed, a large share of the reparations movement&rsquo;s intellectual leadership has come from the law schools. The new advocates weren&rsquo;t opposed to legislated compensation programs. But they reserved most of their passion for the very alternative that Bittker had ruled out as too chancy, acrimonious, and difficult: lawsuits against private parties.</p>
<p>Perhaps the new academic reparationists&rsquo; most distinctive contribution was to try to establish links between slavery and private actors not widely regarded as tainted by it &mdash; the more respectable, forward-minded, and non-Southern these institutions, the better. Thus it came to light that some New England insurance companies in antebellum days had collected premiums from slaveholders for policies written on slaves&rsquo; lives. Northern newspapers had published classified ads announcing slave auctions and seeking the recapture of runaways. And elite universities like Harvard and Brown had received major financial benefactions from slaveholders and traders. As revelations of this kind emerged &mdash; some institutions, self-critically, did the digging and reporting themselves &mdash; a number of businesses and universities issued apologies or pledged increased donations to black causes.</p>
<p>Large corporations&rsquo; slavery links proved especially plentiful because so many of today&rsquo;s banks, railroads, and industrial concerns had built themselves up from hundreds of smaller predecessors around the country; to score a reparations &#8220;hit,&#8221; you simply had to tag one of those earlier, absorbed, firms. {snip}</p>
<p>If that tactic didn&rsquo;t work, how about this one: might not a Northern business have profited by its precursors&rsquo; handling or use of slave-produced products, such as the rice, sugar, tobacco, and turpentine that traveled around the world? Or perhaps it numbered among the &#8220;shipbuilders, sailors, ropemakers, caulkers, and countless other northern businesses that serviced and benefited from the cotton trade,&#8221; as Robinson put it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This quest for generalized guilt made reparations come alive for university students and other potential allies of the movement, and it made excellent copy for the press, providing ready-made controversy in which some stuffy institution would squirm at the exposure of its ignoble past. It also helped undermine what some saw as the irritating smugness of many whites whose forebears had never resided in the South or owned slaves. The more institutions remote from Southern history could be linked to slavery, the more seeming bystanders &mdash; the Rhode Island bank teller, the railroad employee in Colorado, the Seattle engineer descended from recent immigrants &mdash; could plausibly be portrayed as undeserving inheritors of &#8220;white privilege.&#8221; It remained true, as in Bittker&rsquo;s day, that drastic stretching of old legal concepts would be necessary before private businesses, landowners, or families would have to pay anything. But by the nineties, proposals to open up unheard-of forms of liability via such conceptual stretching had become standard fare, applauded and encouraged in the law schools &mdash; and the courts were by no means immune to shifts in elite and public opinion. Plus, after a long delay, reparations claims arising from World War II atrocities had started coming to court. Many felt that these suits would serve as a precedent for the revival of claims older still.</p>
<p>In late 2000, the seemingly most impressive advance yet for reparations appeared: the unveiling of a new project called the Reparations Assessment Group, which would ready lawsuits against defendants both public and private. {snip}</p>
<p>No one knew exactly how big the suits would be, but the dollar sums mentioned started in the trillions and quickly climbed. Harper&rsquo;s published an estimate of $97 trillion, which would require extracting, on average, approximately $300,000 from every American of non-slave descent. Here and there a dissenting voice spoke out, saying that it was unfair to saddle present-day defendants with the guilt of their ancestors. {snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reparations advocates began to get legislative help, mostly &mdash; but not exclusively &mdash; in lawmaking bodies where black votes were pivotal. A near-unanimous Chicago city council passed an ordinance requiring companies wishing to do business with city hall to disclose past ties to slavery, the better to fuel hoped-for legal action, and similar measures passed in Detroit, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia. California lawmakers directed the University of California to conduct research linking the state&rsquo;s modern economy to the efforts of slaves, again seeking to ease the way for litigation. Advocates began to talk of legislative action to reopen lapsed statutes of limitation.</p>
<p>So confident were reparationists of success that they began to map out how the court-ordered reparations would be spent. {snip}</p>
<p>The attacks of September 11, 2001, broke this momentum with an abrupt jolt. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Editorialists and liberal churchmen aside, a vanishingly small share of whites supported the idea &mdash; 5 percent in one poll, 4 percent in another &mdash; while those opposed routinely topped 90 percent. The administrator of a survey in Alabama called reparations the most racially polarizing issue the pollsters had ever asked about, and added: &#8220;The mere mention of reparations and an official U.S. government apology for slavery &mdash; another issue addressed in the poll &mdash; caused many white respondents to get so angry that they had trouble completing the interview.&#8221; It became clear, too, that a substantial sector of black opinion quietly opposed reparations &mdash; and sometimes not so quietly, as when well-known author Juan Williams slammed it as &#8220;a dangerous, evil idea [that could] take American race relations on a crash course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the reparations movement&rsquo;s collapsing fortunes, it wasn&rsquo;t surprising that in 2004, Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry &mdash; overwhelmingly favored by African-American voters in his race against George W. Bush &mdash; flatly rejected the idea as divisive, and did so in a discussion at historically black Howard University. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And as a legal matter, the reparations claims proved desperately weak. Consider the seemingly precedential claims arising from atrocities in wartime Europe. The press had generally assumed the legal merit of these suits, which did have several crucial advantages over slavery claims, most obviously that they arose from mistreatment of persons still or recently alive. Yet they mostly went nowhere before actual judges. Thus a federal judge threw out four high-profile class actions over slave labor in Nazi Germany, ruling that a postwar treaty had already addressed and resolved such claims and that to reopen the question by judicial fiat &#8220;would be to express the ultimate lack of respect&#8221; for the work of Truman-era U.S. policymakers. (Some of the European suits won sizable settlements without going to trial; that, however, had much to do with their targets&rsquo; fear of political sanctions and continued bad publicity, as distinct from actual court rulings.)</p>
<p>In 2005, a federal judge briskly tossed out the Farmer-Paellmann and related reparations suits, in a decision largely upheld by the Seventh Circuit the next year. The suits failed on exactly the grounds that one would predict: standing (those injured were the plaintiffs&rsquo; ancestors, not themselves); the &#8220;political-question&#8221; doctrine (decisions on how best to clean up after the Civil War were best entrusted to the other branches, not the judiciary); and, inevitably, the statute of limitations.</p>
<p>For most newspapers, the suit&rsquo;s dismissal was a back-pages story; everyone had moved on. {snip}<br>

		<p>I am 100% for reparations.  The black man and his greedy white Bolshevik sidekicks have enslaved millions of middle class Americans and we Americans must demand reparations for the oppression this has caused.  Let me explain.  Welfare is a type of slavery for the white middle class who must work two jobs many times to pay for a worthless human non-producer who collects his food an shelter off the hard work and sweat of the producers.  Who is producing?  Poor black slave holders i.e. welfare recipients are non-producing and need rubbers and workfare but must not be permitted to enslave the producers.  Free the white man from them people!</p>

		<p>Could this possibly point towards the one possible saving grace of an (illegal) Obama presidency?  The glass ceiling has at least clearly been broken for Affirmative Action Americans, reducing the already appallingly poorly justified argument for the Great Giveaway to the relevance of writings on the back of a cereal box.  For those remaining 4 or 5% of foolish European American people (and I really doubt that these so-called &#8220;whites&#8221; are the real deal) who support reparations, I say go for it&hellip; keep watching Oprah, and send your checks already!  </p>

		<p> Just when these racial radicals thought they were about to perpetrate the biggest shakedown in world history, they ran slam into several brick walls   &mdash;   not the least of which was the fact that the race which would be sued, still comprising anywhere from 67 percent to 75 percent of the U.S. population, almost unanimously opposes so-called &#8220;reparations for slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p> Plus even blacks realized that such a shakedown would be ruinously divisive. Not to mention our current economic crisis which precludes any such nonsensical picking of the nation&rsquo;s pocket to benefit a particular, favored group. Yes, folks, once in a while there IS justice, after all!</p>

		<p>Blacks have been given their reparations many times over in social spending, affirmative action, et al. </p>
<p> I would consider would be a one time payment of 100K to each whiny black that demands it, in exchange for his citizenship. He would also receive a one way ticket back to any african country of his choosing, never to return to the USA. I can almost guarantee a cost savings to the US over the lifetime of any aggrieved black who takes such an offer. </p>

		<p>In other words, the reparations crowd is going to quiet down because white people might react and start thinking racially.  Also, their zeal to indict virtually every American business sector that makes a profit only meant turning more otherwise allied types against them.</p>

		<p>Small wonder so many Americans oppose reparations. Which is really a fancy name for blackmail (no pun intended). Anyone with half a brain knows that a few years after having received those undeserved reparations, the demand would start all over again. &#8220;Not enough. Not fairly distributed&#8221;, etc., etc., etc. Ad infinitum.</p>

		<p>Mr. Olson is far too dismissive about the prospects for reparations. So what that 90% of Whites are opposed? Demographics are not on our side.  In a couple more decades, if even that, minorities will be able to legislate anything their collective heart desires from Whites.</p>

<p>Since when does overwhelming public support translate into corresponding action by our political &#8220;representatives&#8221;?</p>
<p>Public opposition against the Wall Street bailout was massive. It ultimately passed with overhwelming support in Congress. Public opposition against the auto industry&rsquo;s bailout is massive. It will ultimately pass with overwhelming support in Congress. Likewise, public opposition to reparations is large. So what? Politicians do as their corporate masters dictate.</p>
<p>The truth is that reparations would be good for the owners of large corporations. Since the concept of saving money is completely foreign to Blacks, the reparation cash would go directly from the pockets of taxpaying Whites, through the hands of Blacks, directly to the corporate masters; every penny of it.</p>
<p>Reparations are coming, just as sure as God made little green apples.<br>

I hope the momentum isn&rsquo;t winding down. I want these people screaming in the streets that every white person is guilty and every white person ows them money. I want blacks pounding on the windshield of cars stopped at lights shouting &#8216;show me the money!&rsquo; There&rsquo;s nothing better for race-realists than an irrational angry black man shouting at white people just trying to live their daily lives. Only when it&rsquo;s in-your-face will whites know what charges and demands blacks are making.<br>

		<p>This reparation issue will not go away until the whites take a more forceful stand.  Not once but forever otherwise it will keep bubbling up because the blacks are used to free hand outs not all but most.  The blacks here in the U.S. are treated and supported on a paradise level in comparison to their own country of origin, Africa and by their own kind.  This country has very foolishly allowed itself to be held hostage by ideals that have degraded the work force, education, population demographics to a third world level.  Now it has even elected a black man into the highest office.  This particular individual is inexperienced and a master manipulator as like the leaders in Africa.  One of the reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire was the degradation of the gene pool.  The survival of this country due to its present path is highly questionable.<br>

		<p>There is just to much other stuff going on this country (and the world) for any thoughts about &#8220;reparations&#8221;, let alone handing over gobs of money to race-hustlers i.e. Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, NAACP and  Mo Dees and his Southern Poverty Law race pimps. And we all know that is what reparations are about, enriching these clowns. That would be absolute political suicide for Barack Obama and he knows it. Maybe, if Obama makes a second term, there might be some calls to direct attention to this &#8220;issue&#8221;. But, it&rsquo;s just harder for the race-hustlers out there to whine about &#8220;reparations&#8221; and &#8220;what&rsquo;s owed us&#8221; when you&rsquo;re doing all your complaining to a BLACK PRESIDENT.</p>

<p>Great idea - I second that motion! </p>
<p>Blacks may have had a real shot at official &#8220;reparations&#8221; as late as the 90s, but now the chance is gone forever with the Mexican/Central American invasion.  Mestizos have surpassed blacks in population numbers, and they will NEVER agree to give blacks handouts that they don&rsquo;t also receive.  </p>

		<p>As one poster wisely stated earlier on this site&hellip;</p>
<p>Reparations are PAID IN FULL!</p>
<p>First, the Civil War in which over 620,000 troops, from the North and South, died in the struggle for the freedom of 4,000,000 slaves&hellip;</p>
<p>Then, 100 years later, the Civil Rights Movement in which blacks have been reaping in all of the cash benefits and advantages since&hellip;</p>
<p>And finally, Barack Hussein Obama - the President of the United States of America.</p>
<p>As I say&hellip;  I rest my case.</p>

		<p>While I hardly believe that we should grant reparations to blacks-it is an absurd idea:</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the topic is off the table. So 90% of whites don&rsquo;t like reparations? How many like endless Affirmative Action and set asides and other anti-white government (and forced upon private sector) programs? </p>
<p>I know the governments broke but with all these multi-trillion bailouts I&rsquo;m sure certain rabble rousers will see this evidence that they can get a cut as well.</p>
<p>And as far as Obamalama changing things, unfortunately I don&rsquo;t think so. Blacks are so militantly focused on the struggle that I don&rsquo;t think anything other than focused white militancy can stop them (and at the current time most whites don&rsquo;t seem to want to take up the yoke of militancy).</p>

		<p>They already get reparations.  It&rsquo;s called welfare and affirmative action, and a &#8220;protected&#8221; status.</p>
<p>How many people know that there were black slave owners?</p>
<p>How come you don&rsquo;t hear Native Americans (I am part Cherokee) whining about reparations?</p>
<p>I might also add that many slaves were treated well by their masters.  So what&rsquo;s all the whining about?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The mere mention of reparations and an official U.S. government apology for slavery &mdash; another issue addressed in the poll &mdash; caused many white respondents to get so angry that they had trouble completing the interview.</p>
<p>Therein lies the rub. If only whites would grow a pair and get angry more often, not only would such talk be taken for what it is-nonsense- but similar legislation having anything to do with race, reparations, affirmative action, and quotas would draw a similar response. </p>

		<p>The fact that 90% of whites oppose reparations means squat, what whites want no longer matters. Despite that I am all in favoour of reparations if we follow the style of our good friends and allies,<br>
the Saudis. When they abolished slavery in November 1962, they promptly paid a compensation of £1000 per slave TO THE OWNERS.</p>

		<p>The reason that reparations won&rsquo;t happen is that blacks will be suing the biggest corporations,cities, states, and even the federal government, not individual whites.</p>
<p>They have good cases against some companies.  </p>
<p>For instance Lehman Brothers investments started out around 1800 in New Orleans.  Their official history says they were humble cotton brokers.  They also dealt in another commodity, one far more profitable than cotton.  They were the 2nd biggest slave trading brokerage in the south.  Likewise Lazard Freres were a major southern slave brokerage.</p>
<p>Slaves were regularly smuggled to the south long after 1808 when the importation of slaves was outlawed.  Louisianna, home of 19th century Lehman Brothers was a favored locale to land and sell the African slaves.  The Union Army discovered a shipment of Africans who landed in Louisianna as late as 1864.  They wanted to stay. &#8221; If you send us back we will just be sold again.&#8221; was their reason for staying. They were given land, animals, seeds and farm equpiment and made a little settlement for themselves.</p>
<p>The reparations crew could probably find or just make up evidence that Lehman and Lazard bought and sold slaves who had been smuggled from Africa long after 1808.</p>
<p>Lots of comapnies can be traced back to colonial times. For instance Colgate Palmolive.  The soap maker Mr. Colgate expanded in the 1820&rsquo;s and soon became a major company.  The Colgate family made soap for decades before that, when slavery was legal in New York.  So maybe they had some slaves who worked for them.</p>
<p>Founder of Standard Oil, John Rockefeller started his career at 14 working for a relative who owned a small commodities brokerage that operated on the great lakes and Ohio river.  In those days, family businesses lasted for many decades as they went from father to son. Maybe some Rockefeller ancestor employed a slave in his business and the business could be considered a forerunner to standard oil. </p>
<p>Then there is Chocolate City as they proudly call it.  Washington DC took more than 150 years to be built, but in the first 40 years the builders were exclusively blacks, a few freemen but mostly blacks rented from their owners.</p>
<p>The 1800 census showed about 750 inhabitants of DC, less than 200 whites and around 550 blacks.  The blacks were mostly men, mostly slaves building the city. If anyone owes reparations, the city of Washington and the federal government owes the slaves who created the roads, bridges and built the capitol and White House.</p>
<p>Bank of America was the subject of an extortion attempt by the black poverty pimps about 5 years ago.  It seemed ridiculous at first.  </p>
<p>Bank of America started around 1880, after the civil war.  Bank of America started in California where slavery had always been illegal.  When Americans started coming in bringing  black slaves, the Mexican government in 1829 passed a law specifically outlawing slavery. There never were  black slaves in California so how could a California bank have to pay slavery reparations?</p>
<p>Simple replied the black poverty pimps and their avaricious white lawyers.  </p>
<p>Bank of America started to expand nationwide in the 1980&rsquo;s, 116 years after the civil war. It aquired some banks that sometime between 1700 and 1865, somewhere along the line, aquired a business, or some real estate, or some second hand machinery or something or other that had been owned by a slave owner at some time in the past. BofA was therfore responsible for slavery that may or may not have occurred 150 years before it was founded.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what happened about the BofA extortion attempt.</p>
<p>The corporations love affirmative action because they hate whites.  They don&rsquo;t care about black on white crime because it doesn&rsquo;t apply to them.  They love third world immigration and affirmative action for women because it gives them cheap, docile, disposable labor and ferocious feminazis to enforce the oppressive HR rules.</p>
<p>So they are happy to sacrifice middle and working class whites to the race war.  As long as they can afford to pay for the very top medical care they don&rsquo;t care that soon most physicians will be  incompetent negligent affirmative action non whites.</p>
<p>But when it comes to blacks suing the corporations instead of the carpenter&rsquo;s union well, that is a different story.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t Wachovia bank pay something like 400 million in reparations a couple years ago?  That alerted the corporations and governments to what might happen. So they put a stop to the reparations movement. The only entity that will pay and pay and pay for these non existent black grievances will be the ordinary white until we are exterminated.</p>
<p>The corporations will encourage and contribute to more and more affirmative action, black on white crime and the teaching of hatred against whites in our public schools, universities and the media the corporations own.</p>
<p>They have the money to pay to keep the black establishment off their backs and on ours.  Actually, truth is, the corporations own the black establishment.  They created it, they fund it.</p>
<p>Blacks should remember that the corporations can close down the black establishment as easily as they created it. After all, the NAACP was majority white right up to the 1960&rsquo;s.  It didn&rsquo;t get its first black president until 1975.  Be careful not to offend your masters.</p>

		<p>How about some reparations from the government to cover the cost of putting a club on my steering wheel, home alarm system and a gun I recently purchased?</p>
