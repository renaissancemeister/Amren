<p>A new study of college freshman suggests that African Americans may obtain higher grades if they live with a white roommate.</p>
<p>A detailed study of students at a large, predominantly-white university revealed that while living with a white roommate may be more challenging than living with someone of the same race, many Black students appear to benefit from the experience.</p>
<p>For African American students, this could translate into as much as 0.30-point increase in their GPA in their first quarter of college.</p>
<p>White students, on the other hand, were affected more by the academic ability of their roommate than by their race.</p>
<p>While the study results may seem one-sided, earlier studies by these researchers and others reinforces the value of students&rsquo; experience with members of different races and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Researchers from Ohio State University and Virginia Commonwealth University found that nearly one in every six interracial roommate relationships failed, meaning at least one roommate moved out, by the end of the first quarter. But African American students who were paired with a white roommate performed better academically than did those with a same-race roommate.</p>
<p>These African American students may be better adjusted to college because they live with someone who can help them learn about the challenges and norms of a different environment, said Natalie Shook, lead author of the study, who started the work as a graduate student at Ohio State.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s already known that interracial roommate relationships are more difficult than same-race relationships. But despite the problems, we&rsquo;ve shown that there are benefits in how well Black students perform academically,&#8221; said Shook, who is now an assistant professor of psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>
<p>She conducted the study with Russell Fazio, a professor of psychology at Ohio State, who has been studying interracial attitudes and relationships for the past 15 years. The pair published the results in the October 2008 issue of the journal Group Processes and Intergroup Relations.</p>
<p>The pair collected data on college freshman in more than 2,700 dorm rooms at a large, predominately white university. They studied how successful relationships were for students who specifically requested to live with someone, as well those who were randomly assigned to a roommate. Room assignments were studied alongside the students&rsquo; SAT or ACT scores, autumn quarter GPA in the fall of 2001 and 2002, and their ethnic background to test for significant differences between students in all room types.</p>
<p>The results showed that randomly assigned roommates were more likely to move to another room, regardless of the students&rsquo; race. Fifteen percent of randomly paired interracial relationships dissolved, compared to the 8.1 percent and 6.4 percent of randomly assigned same-race white rooms and same-race African American rooms, respectively.</p>
<p>But the researchers point out that the number of interracial room dissolutions was much lower than they expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;The university in the study was experiencing a housing crunch that year, so more students probably may not have been able to change rooms for the first quarter. Some of the previous work showed much higher rates than did our work here. But of the 85 percent of those that did try to work things out, we see real, tangible benefits,&#8221; Fazio said.</p>
<p>The researchers found that African American students who scored higher on their ACT (24 and above) and SAT (1040 and above) were more likely to be successful in college if they were randomly paired with a white student. Black students who scored lower on their ACT and SAT did not see any improvement in their GPA if they roomed with a white student.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that the interaction between a white and an African American student may help orient these minority students to a predominantly white university, Shook said. By living with their white counterparts, the African American students are finding someone with whom they can study and learn from in ways other African American students cannot offer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Particularly for minority students, there is a lot of added stress to belong and succeed at a predominately white university. This intergroup contact and exposure to diversity may help minority students adjust in ways same-race relationships cannot,&#8221; Shook said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if we can help them adjust more quickly to find their university identity, then hopefully that can also translate into more academic success.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, white students&rsquo; grades were virtually unaffected by the race of their roommate. White students earned higher GPAs when assigned to someone who was more successful academically.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a predominately white institution, so their roommate is not a means by which they can get integrated into the community. So the race of the roommate proves irrelevant and the day-to-day environment becomes more important. If their roommate is very competent and studious, or less competent, more of a partygoer, that has a larger impact on their success,&#8221; Fazio said.</p>
<p>Even though the race of their roommate did not affect them academically, the researchers believe that living with an African American benefits whites in another way.</p>
<p>Fazio said previous research suggests that many of the automatically activated stereotypes that whites may harbor about African Americans, consciously or subconsciously, dissolve when they interact extensively with someone of another race. This interaction not only helps white students get over their initial fears and prejudices, it also affects comfort level with other minorities in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is definitely not easy for students at first; it is more stressful and more difficult to live in an interracial situation than in same race situations. But if people stick with it, their racial attitudes improve and it definitely outweighs any initial difficulty. This is just one way we can overcome our misconceptions and biases and learn to appreciate our differences earlier on in life,&#8221; Shook said.</p>

<p>The effects of same-race versus interracial dormitory roommate relationships were explored with regard to relationship dissolution and academic achievement (i.e., grade point average). The present investigation made use of archival data spanning two academic years at a large, relatively diverse university. Of primary interest were White and African American first-year students assigned to White or African American roommates upon their arrival on campus. Another factor that was incorporated into this analysis was whether students requested to live with their roommates or were randomly assigned. Interracial roommate relationships were more likely to dissolve than either same-race White or same-race African American relationships. Randomly assigned living situations were less successful than ones in which roommates requested to share a room. Concerning grade point average at the end of the first academic quarter, African American first-year students tended to do better in interracial living situations, whereas White first-year students&rsquo; academic success was not affected by roommate race. Instead, White first-year students were more sensitive to the academic abilities of their roommates. Results are discussed with regard to the implications for intergroup contact.</p>
<p>Key Words: academic achievement o contact hypothesis o intergroup relations o roommate relationships<br>

		<p>In other words, Black people benefit from being around Whites, but Whites don&rsquo;t benefit from being around Blacks.  Hundreds of years of history has already proven this beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>A recent study from Dartmouth University showed that Whites actually experience a decrease in cognitive ability after having a conversation with a Black person.  I&rsquo;m surprised that the data from Ohio State doesn&rsquo;t reflect this  &mdash;  Whites with Black roommates having lower GPAs than would be expected from their ACT or SAT scores  &mdash;  or perhaps they chose not to look at that issue.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that the reason that more Whites don&rsquo;t move out of their dorm rooms when they find out they have a Black roommate is simply out of White Guilt and not wanting to appear &#8216;racist&rsquo;.  Blacks will just move out and not care what Whitey thinks.</p>

		<p>Since when are they concerned about the well-being of whites, vis a vis diversity or otherwise? Oh - I guess by a benefit to whites, they mean it supposedly gives white students a higher opinion of non-whites. </p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s what the students of color are doing at their diversity meetings, consciousness raising clubs, and with their scholarship and their activities? Learning how to have a proper appreciation for whites and their causes. Or might it be quite the opposite?</p>

		<p>Any given white student will be very likely to have higher SAT scores than a given black student (college admission standards differ substantially for the two races).  Therefore, any black student assigned to room with a white student will probably be rooming with someone with a higher SAT   &mdash;   making it appear the effect is race-based, when it&rsquo;s only SAT-based.</p>
<p>With white students, the same effect will apply, but it is correctly diagnosed here since white students will rarely be paired with a higher-SAT black (and apparently rooming with a lower-SAT student does not bring GPA DOWN, or else that information was withheld for reasons of political correctness).</p>
<p>Of course, the paragraph noting that low-SAT blacks do not do better when paired with whites undermines this whole line of reasoning   &mdash;   both mine and the researchers&rsquo;, and makes it look like the effect works for low-SAT whites, but NOT for low-SAT blacks   &mdash;   a depressing and un-PC conclusion.  </p>

I didn&rsquo;t read anything about changes in the white students grades. Did they remain the same, improve, or fall?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;For African American students, this could translate into as much as 0.30-point increase in their GPA in their first quarter of college.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>A POSSIBLE increase of .3 per quarter?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how long before this new wacky theory is tauted as the next great hope for blacks and is forced on white college kids.</p>
<p>Of course, I can see a good deal of backlash and resistance from angry blacks over this one for implying that they do better solely because they are around whites.</p>
<p>More inane theories from the loony left fringe.<br>

<p>It is so amazing how liberals are able to miss the obvious. The Blacks who are most able to comfortably share a room with Whites are obviously a little more White in their thinking than the average Black. This explains why they perform better. </p>

		<p>When they say racial stereotypes dissolve they except us to immediately infer that this is for the good.  However, as we all know stereotypes and prejudices are almost always true.</p>
<p>Replacing stereotypes and prejudices with contrary conception about a race of people simply based on an unscientific brief encounter with an atypical sample is not a wise policy.  That is what our college students need to hear.<br>

		<p>When I was in public School during the 1950&rsquo;s, I noted that Blacks who got along with White students did much better academically than those who didn&rsquo;t. Not that the Blacks had close relationships with Whites, just the ability to deal with Whites in scholastic, athletic, and street racing endeavors. I suspect that there was a strong correlation with the I.Q. of the Blacks in this case, as there is at OSU roommating discussed above. </p>

		<p>This is an example of &#8216;MINIMAL DIVERSITY&#8221; since presumably the African American [assuming that he is not a football player or basketball player]is a part of the ten percent that the rest of the ninety per cent tries to latch their coat tails upon.</p>
<p>If Ohio State were really concerned about DIVERSITY then it should place the white student with a ghetto African American with a second grade reading proficiency. That would be DIVERSITY!!!</p>
<p>What is really disingenuous about all of these so called University eggheads is that they try to extrapolate a very tiny sample into imputing characteristics into the population as a whole, thereby violating the premises of every logic and statistics course taught in their own pristine environment.        </p>
<p>There are without a doubt some African Americans, who for whatever reason, are fairly bright and perform well academically. However, assume if you will, that you arrive in YOUR first calculus class at Ohio State University, which all incoming freshmen are expected to take and pass [yes Virginia there still are such places - Ohio State just ain&rsquo;t one], and in your class are twenty African American students and twenty Japanese students. On your first day in class your task is to predict which of these two groups as a whole would have the highest overall grade by the end of the semester; and, just to make it interesting, if you were to choose incorrectly you would be summarily executed for your own politically correct stupidity. </p>
<p>What these eggheads never seem to understand is that if there were really no differences; and, if African Americans could actually compete on their own merits, there would be no need for Affirmative Action. {Furthermore, if these Universities were really fair there would be absolutely no indication whatsoever on the admission forms as to a prospective student&rsquo;s race - if that were ever the case just how many African Americans would THEN be admitted?}  </p>
<p>This so called study is a crafted lie designed to facilitate a fiction. It is meaningless. It is an extension, by derivation, of University admission policies which are lies, and our society as a whole which is governed by laws which are lies, O.K. a legal fiction if you will, that promotes this blatant discrimination against whites [and all other races for that matter]in order to prop up an intellectually inferior race. </p>
<p>Although it may seem seedy and undemocratic to be racially selective, this country is in a life and death academic struggle with China, Korea, and Japan. And strangely, none of these countries have a very sizable African or Hispanic population do they? And hint: &#8220;They ain&rsquo;t a gonna neither!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just returned from visiting New Orleans again. If, diversity were really an advantage then New Orleans should be that bright beacon on the mountain, and the residents of that &#8220;great&#8221; city should be &#8220;happy as clams&#8221; In effect, New Orleans is nothing more than Affirmative Actions run a muck! The Ohio State egghead that crafted that study should spend some time down there - in New Orleans, or Detroit,  or Washington D.C., or for that matter, anywhere else that African Americans are in charge. Thats reality!!!  </p>

		<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t people just be free to live, work and study near and away from who they want and don&rsquo;t want without having to be subjected to all this racial analysis and hand wringing on the part of the self appointed social engineers?</p>
<p>Whatever happened to just making America a great place to live?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got jobs leaving the country at a record pace, student standards and skills dropping at an alarming rate, and still more immigrants pouring in to take jobs that no longer exist, and feed off the social welfare trough that is presently bankrupt.</p>
<p>And our so called &#8220;leaders&#8221; see nothing wrong with this scenario?</p>

		<p>I never had any contact with blacks until I had one as a roommate in college.  For an entire semester, I was lectured by him and his pals about how Whites had everything in life handed to us, (my assembly line working father and waitress mother got a kick out of that)and how his people had to fight for everything that got.  (He was receiving copious handouts for school while I took a personal student loan.)  I can honestly say that I wasn&rsquo;t a racist until I was forced to live with a black. </p>

		<p>Why is it that at a social gathering 2 blacks could walk into a room of 100 or more whites and the whites will fall all over themselves being cordial and trying to befriend the blacks? But you would see no such thing if the situation were reversed. What is that makes whites so eager to befriend blacks? Blacks could not care less about befriending or telling the world about how many white friends they have. This has puzzled me for decades I hope someone can provide an answer.</p>

<p>Amost on target&hellip; The truth - The Black room mate copies the White room mates homework and the White room mate is forced to provide tutoring for free.  If the White room mate is White and female, she is also forced to &#8220;date&#8221; her Black male room mate.  But hey, reality TV shows made that all acceptable in our &#8220;progressive&#8221; society.</p>

<p>Look at this totalitarian manner of thinking. &#8216;Racial attitudes improve&rsquo; &#8216;overcome our misconceptions and biases&rsquo; &#8216;learn to appreciate our differences&rsquo;</p>
<p>Who is this fool to decree that anybody&rsquo;s racial attitudes need to improve? Maybe the &#8216;misconceptions&rsquo; and &#8216;biases&rsquo; are empirical reality. These students have to &#8216;learn to appreciate&rsquo; - or else - is the implication. Freedom of conscience an actual universal human right dictates that anybody can have any opinion of other races they wish.  <br>

Judging from the recent election, kids today are probably more naive and stereotype-free than I was.  I thought I could have black friends (it was the seventies, and everything seemed possible).  But in the end I LEARNED MY PREJUDICES FROM INTERACTING WITH BLACKS, WHILE IN COLLEGE.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid I should have had a black roommate.  Living in the dorm with them was bad enough.  And these kids were middle-class blacks from nice Mississippi Delta families.  Junior year, I had my own apartment.  Michel Guerard had just published CUISINE MINCEUR.  I learned to cook from it.  This was a fusion of Haute Cuisine and diet food&hellip;a watershed work, and the basis for spa cuisine to this day.  I followed the recipes to the letter.  Anyway, the derision I got from my black &#8216;friends&rsquo; over the food still hurts when I remember.  I got condescending &#8216;advice&rsquo; on how to fry the fish (rather than steaming it on herbs), so that it wouldn&rsquo;t be so &#8216;bland&rsquo;. </p>
<p>In the intervening years, thanks to my &#8216;bland&rsquo; &amp; &#8216;bizarre&rsquo; frenchy food, I&rsquo;ve gone up just one dress size.  You should see my black former &#8216;friends&rsquo;.  Those who haven&rsquo;t dropped dead from obesity diseases actually NEED their Escalades, to haul their big selves around in.  They seem to have gained nothing from knowing me, and I only gained insecurity.  Except for immediate family, all meals at our house are takeout or catered.</p>

		<p>Does this strike anyone as strange that these students are being observed almost as laboratory rats? Hopefully this was more an observation of something naturally occuring than socially engineered although I doubt it.</p>

<p>Correct. And thanks for reminding me of <a href="https://www.demotivateus.com/index.php?s=stereotypes&amp;search.x=0&amp;search.y=0" rel="nofollow">this poster</a>, which I found quite by accident and is now one of my favorite desktop wallpapers.</p>

<p>Interesting that as adults the 90% try to leech off the so-called &#8220;talented tenth&#8221;. As kids, they were verbally and physically assaulting those same superior intellects 24/7 for &#8220;acting white&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of the terrible experiences that students experience in dorms at my university.  Our university puts blacks into share-a-room living situations with white or international students.  The white and international students experience blacks engaging in bullying behavior, playing loud music, talking on the phone all night, borrowing or stealing their money, ad infinitum.</p>

		<p>This is just another excellent reason - not that we really needed one - for university students to live in off-campus apartments.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see: &#8220;dormitory diversity commissars&#8221;, &#8220;speech codes&#8221;, Marxist indoctrination masquerading as humanities coursework, and now the possibility of enforced &#8220;diversity&#8221; in dorm room assignments.  Are responsible parents really supposed to want to PAY for this?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Which is it? Do Blacks do better when placed in a White environment or do Blacks do better in Afro-centric environments taught by and surrounded by &ldquo;people who look like them&rdquo;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Both! Because all that&rsquo;s important is what&rsquo;s best for blacks.  </p>

		<p>I can think of no advantage at all that comes to Whites from being around blacks. Blacks may possibly benefit, but Whites certainly don&rsquo;t. My advice is to avoid blacks, period. You will be better off.</p>
