			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pat Flynn, Irish Times (Dublin), December 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE UNDOCUMENTED Irish in the United States were discussed at Shannon airport last night when the Minister for Defence Willie O&rsquo;Dea TD met former US Republican presidential candidate senator John McCain.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Mr O&rsquo;Dea said: &#8220;We met for about 40 minutes and it was very productive and cordial. Senator McCain has committed to raising the issue of the undocumented Irish with president-elect Obama on his return to the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr McCain&rsquo;s aircraft made a refuelling stop at Shannon on his way back to the US after spending the past week on a regional tour with two other members of the senate armed services committee, senators Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham.</p>
<p>Mr O&rsquo;Dea was deputising for Minister for Foreign Affairs Miche√°l Martin who is on official business in Brussels.</p>
<p>Mr Martin has already committed to seeking a visa agreement with the US authorities for the &#8220;undocumented&#8221; Irish in the US. He stated last month that &#8220;finding a solution for our undocumented citizens is a key priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arrangements for last night&rsquo;s meeting were finalised last Friday but were not publicised for security reasons.</p>
<p>The men also discussed the establishment of the new US customs pre-clearance facility which was agreed between the Irish and US governments last month and which will open in Shannon next year. The facility will speed up the process of entry into the US.<br>

<p>So now every illegal alien, tourist and visitor is a citizen.  If anyone deserved to lose the election, it is McCain.  He is as much a traitor as every President in the last 50 years.</p>

		<p>If only McCain could put forth that kind of concern towards the millions of illegal Mestizos in our country instead of a small number of illegal Irish who cause no problems (other than maybe trying to steal our lucky charms)</p>

My solution is this:</p>
<p>Make it clear that if you&rsquo;re in the country illegally, you have, say, 2 to 3 months to leave. If you&rsquo;re not gone after a set time, you&rsquo;re subject to arrest, forfeiture of assets, and relinquish all future rights to return legally after you&rsquo;re deported.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll leave in droves (Of course no western nation has the courage to make such a declaration).</p>

		<p>With everyone in the world getting here by hook or &#8220;crook,&#8221; there are going to be some empty countries around. Maybe we who are disgusted with the invasion of our nation, can go stake our claims in Ireland, Mexico or what ever spot we want and start all over again. However, I&rsquo;m sure that when we create another progressive nation, they&rsquo;d all want to follow.</p>

<p>Errm&hellip;.you do know that the Irish played a fairly significant role in the creation of America, right?</p>

		<p>I am not sure what this article is implying by posting this article, are we supposed to shun even WHITE immigrants? If so I find such views insane at a time when Mestizos, Somalians, Muslims, etc. are pouring in by the millions every year.</p>
<p>If we start granting special preference to white immigrants like the Irish it would be a small step (albeit a VERY small step) towards to returning to a sane immigration policy.</p>

<p>Who is &#8220;we&#8221; exactly?</p>
<p>I seriously doubt that you could create a website never mind a progessive nation. <br>
Stick to dreaming about claiming empty countries and other flights of fantasy and leave the serious discussion to people who actually have something worthwhile to contribute to this discussion, there&rsquo;s a good girl.</p>

		<p>I honestly wish John, &#8220;Americans wouldn&rsquo;t pick lettuce for fifty dollars and hour&#8221; McCain, would just retire off into the sunset and leave Americans alone.</p>

		<p>Pathetic. Not only is McCain focusing on white illegals, but is concentrating mainly on those of his own ethnic group. </p>

		<p>The public will accept letting the Irish into America so that means a horde of third-worlders will be ok to let in to.  Classic John McCain. </p>

<p>Hordes of third worlders have been, and will continue to be, flooding into the country regardless of the Irish, or any other white group, coming to the states.</p>
