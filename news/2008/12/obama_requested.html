			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>India Times (Gurgaon, Haryana), December 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Asking the US President-elect to take oath of the office in his full name, Barack Hussain Obama, a leading Muslim community leader has said this will help in erasing &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; from the minds of people.</p>
<p>Addressing a public meeting after Eid-ul-Zuha prayers here yesterday, Sheik Ubaid has requested US President-elect to take oath of the office using his full name Barack Hussain Obama and bury &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; in the &#8220;cemetery of other social evils.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader asked Obama to launch a new chapter in the American history in which &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;sexism&#8221; are stamped out of public life and human rights of all are respected.</p>
<p>He also said that with &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221; already erased from the country, the other major social ill to be defeated is &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eid is a joyous occasion and this year, Muslim has much more to celebrate as Obama, whom they had supported, has been elected to lead the United States,&#8221; the community leader said.<br>

		<p>I never thought in my lifetime I&rsquo;d ever see someone named &#8216;Hussain&rsquo; sworn in as president of this country.  Obama&rsquo;s insistence on using his middle name in the swearing in ceremony is an intentional slap in the face to White Americans, and he will enjoy rubbing our faces in it.  Of course, if he had insisted on using his full name during the campaign, he knows he never would have gotten elected.</p>

		<p>Using his middle name is his inaguration is just Obama&rsquo;s way of thumbing his nose at all of the people who used it when he was running. Plain and simple. </p>

		<p>I live in the San Francisco Bay Area.  There are millions of volvos and priuses that have a bumper sticker with the immage of a W with a red circle arount it and red line going through it.  The implication being that George W. Bush is bad and must be stopped.  They are cute.  They intentionally use his middle name because of the WASPish connotation.  If I am not mistaken, Oliver Stone has a movie about President Bush using the same moniker.</p>
<p>Fast forward to all the same hippies in their volvos that cringe when we refer to Obama by his middle name.  They do not like drawing attention to the fact that Obama&rsquo;s father was a Muslim (they don&rsquo;t say why).  The same snarky joke is now &#8220;racist&#8221; and we must cease and desist now or be accused of some type of hate crime.  </p>
<p>For myself, I plan on making up a bumper sticker of an H with a red line going through it.  I bet I can sell a million of em.  </p>

As far as I am concerned to fear something is a healthy emotion which is important. I guess I can now go to Saudi Arabia with a bible and build a church.I can only assume all those laws against the worship of christianity  have been repealed by the Saudis.</p>

		<p>Islamophobia does not exist, since a phobia is an unwarrented fear of something. The fear of islam is most certainly not unwarrented.</p>

		<p>This is just typical. With Obama being elected,I am seeing first hand the Muslim attempt to prominence in South Florida. I was shocked to see a county transit bus with a Full bus advertisment for The Nation of Islam/Muslim   religon. I inquired about this and there are 120 buses in Broward and Miami-Dade counties fully branded with this advertisment. Obamanation is gaining steam!</p>

		<p>If, on September 12, 2001, after it was revealed that the worst terrorist attacks in history were carried out in the name of Islam, and pro-American sentiment was at it&rsquo;s highest in this country, someone had predicted that in a mere seven years we would elect someone with an Islamic background and middle name as president, I would have called the men in white suits. Never underestimate the human capacity to seek appeasement.</p>

<p>The non-sense of multiculturalism. I have nothing against Islam but I do have a problem with Muslims who use religion to force their twisted ideology down my throat. If that&rsquo;s Islamophobia so be it&hellip;(sic) if you can&rsquo;t stand the heat get out of the kitchen!</p>

		<p>As far as I am concerned, Hussein is no worse than Barack.  Just remember, there are a lot of people in this country who have been oppressed by the Muslims.  I do not know of any Muslims who have been oppressed by Christians, unless you mean that they are expected to respect and obey our laws.  I suppose a lot of Muslims would consider that to be oppression.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;A closet-Muslim, born in a Muslim nation and given a Muslim name, sitting in the White House in the aftermath of 9/11 is Islam&rsquo;s greatest psychological victory and America&rsquo;s greatest disgrace.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>To think that this has happened JUST SEVEN YEARS after the 9/11 attacks upon us is absolutely mind-boggling!   Back then, in 2001, who would ever have believed this could happen?  It is almost surreal. </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only Obama. Since then, we have elected Moslem reresentatives to Congress.  And brought in hundreds of thousands of Moslem immigrants   &mdash;   some of them (eg. Somalis) being the most violent and fanatical types.  All of this to show our openness and tolerance.</p>
<p>Does this not represent capitulation, concesssion, a spineless gesture at appeasement?  (Please like us! Please be nice!  We&rsquo;ll give you our country peacefully. No need for violence! We&rsquo;ll hand it over without resistance, but please don&rsquo;t hurt us! See how loving and Christian we are?)  Despite all the fury and outrage in 2001, within a mere 7 years, we have all but surrendered!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether Obama is still a Moslem, or a crypto-Moslem, but to have someone named BARRACK HUSSEIN OBAMA sitting in the White House, just a few years after 911, is quite enough.  It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
