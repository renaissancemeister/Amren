<h1>&lsquo;Idol&rsquo; Fantasia&rsquo;s House in Foreclosure</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlotte Observer, December 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of two Charlotte homes owned by former American Idol winner Fantasia Barrino is in foreclosure, according to Us Magazine.</p>
<p>The national entertainment magazine is reporting this week that Barrino&rsquo;s $1.3 million home on Bevington Place, off Elm Lane in southeast Charlotte, will be auctioned off Jan. 12, if mortgage payments are not made.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barrino, who won the American Idol title in 2004, the show&rsquo;s third season, is a High Point native who attended East Mecklenburg High School and settled in Charlotte. She has been nominated eight times for Grammy awards, has recorded two successful albums and is working on a third album scheduled for release in early 2009.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barrino, 24, bought the home on Seton House Lane in August 2004, a few months after being crowned American Idol, for $740,000. That home has four bedrooms, 3 1/2 baths, and 4,572 heated square feet.</p>

		<p>Not a matter of subprime, but it&rsquo;s a matter of nobody&rsquo;s buying her music, much less downloading it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m very proud to say I don&rsquo;t know a thing about American Idol, or the person they&rsquo;re referring to in this story.</p>
<p>I assume they&rsquo;re referring to a T.V. show, but I don&rsquo;t know and I couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p>
<p>I also quit watching ALL spectator sports about 15 years ago, and am a far better man for it.</p>

		<p>FYI, <i>THIS</i> is the house being foreclosed: <br>
<i>&#8220;The home in financial trouble has 6,232 heated square feet, five bedrooms and 5 1/2 baths, according to Charlotte-Mecklenburg tax records. The home was bought in March 2007.&#8221;  </i></p>
<p>She bought it in March 2007, and it&rsquo;s scheduled for auction in Jan 2009.  Given the backlog in foreclosure courts, she probably made payments for less than a year.  </p>
<p>Can you imagine living in a $1.3 million neighborhood and some illiterate black single mother named &#8220;Fantasia&#8221; moves in next door?!  I wonder what horrors her neighbors were subjected to.  </p>
<p>For more information on her, check out Amren&rsquo;s article &#8220;Fantasia Barrino Reveals She&rsquo;s Illiterate&#8221;:  <br>

		<p>Per a commenter on the Charlotte Observer, here is the house (not in it&rsquo;s current condition, however):<br>

<p>Also, commentators have remarked that after she moved in she stopped taking care of the exterior - the bushes in front of the fountain have gotten so overgrown you can&rsquo;t see the cars in the driveway anymore.  </p>

		<p>No different than many other blacks. They seem not to be able to keep track of their finances very well. Most spend the $ faster than it comes in. So, what else is new?</p>

		<p>(THEY) the (MEDIA) (HOLLYWOOD) (ETC) can all pretend that these black (Screech Owls) are the hottest thing on the planet and most whites in an effort to avoid confrontation will go along with the Great Talent of the black faux-entertainer, BUT when push comes to shove and they do their Real Voting with their Pocketbook THE TRUTH WILL COME TO THE SURFACE. Just being black doesn&rsquo;t make you and entertainer, it just makes you black.</p>

		<p>Ah the Sweet Joy of Diversity. Why is it when blacks speak of living in a Better Neighborhood, it is NEVER an area or blacks?<br>
Have they ever, can they ever, will they ever do anyting of value on their own?</p>
<p>And once they do start to move in it seems as if the Good Neighborhood goes bad pretty fast, so what&rsquo;s the point?</p>

		<p>This is a national disgrace. This hard working, African-American single mother has overcome all obstacles to become one of the first &#8220;American Idol&#8221; winners. ACORN and Jesse Jackson should be petitioning the Government to bail her out and let the taxpayers purchase the home for her because, after all, she&rsquo;s a victim of racism because nobody bought her music. And while we&rsquo;re at it, how about a postage stamp and a national holiday for her too?</p>

		<p>Blacks are always talking about their people having the same opportunities as anyone else to succeed. But it seems like in many cases (Fantasia included), that the family is the first to put out their hand for money. I believe Fantasia&rsquo;s family took advantage of her. Instead of helping her to manage her money, they were helping her blow it. Now that the money is gone, who are they going to live large off of?<br>
