<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20081208/Congress.Vietnamese.American/">1st Vietnamese-American Elected to US Congress</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The first Vietnamese-American elected to Congress took advantage of dissatisfaction with a longtime incumbent dogged by corruption allegations and reflects the changing nature of New Orleans politics since Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Republican immigration attorney Anh &#8220;Joseph&#8221; Cao defeated Democratic U.S. William Jefferson on Saturday in an election postponed for a month by Hurricane Gustav.</p>
<p>The victory for a 41-year-old child of Vietnam War refugees was greeted with amazement and drew parallels to last year&rsquo;s election of Gov. Bobby Jindal, an Indian-American Republican.</p>
<p>It also confirms a general shift to the GOP in Louisiana, where the Democratic Party dominated for generations and no Republican had represented New Orleans since 1890.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cao was buoyed by low turnout, a lackluster campaign by Jefferson, strong third-party candidates and the election being postponed a month by Hurricane Gustav. State and national Republicans seized on the race with a well-funded and effective campaign, bombarding targeted neighborhoods with automated telephone calls, signs and flyers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In many ways, Cao won on a protest vote by white voters from both major parties indignant about Jefferson&rsquo;s staying power. Analysts said white voters turned out by a ratio of 2-to-1 over blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cao (pronounced &#8220;Gow&#8221;) is largely unknown, but his compelling life story attracted many voters. He was born in Vietnam and had to flee the country after Saigon fell in 1975 at age 8. His father, a South Vietnamese army officer, was imprisoned by Communist forces and later released.</p>
<p>He earned a degree in philosophy from Fordham University, a Jesuit college in New York City, and moved to Louisiana in 1992 as a seminarian. He earned his law degree from Loyola University in New Orleans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cao has close ties with the powerful Vietnamese Catholic church, Mary Queen of Vietnam, and vowed that his political bid was motivated by his religiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was something that I was called to do, literally, in the religion sense,&#8221; Cao said.</p>
<p>The congressman-elect describes himself as a political moderate with only one firm policy belief: He is against abortion.</p>

		<p>As bad as Rep. Jefferson is, he seems like a petty crook when compared Rep. Charles Rangel, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means committee.  It is fairly common knowledge that Rangel in involved in numerous &#8220;questionable&#8221; activities.  They range from tax evasion, illegally occupying properities with rent-control exemptions and many more questionable things that seem to amount to selling his office to the highest bidder.  The question is why is this guy not investigated, why is he bullet-proof?</p>
<p>There are so many crooks in congress that term limits seems like a compelling solution.  Sen. Chris Dodd seems like another good candidate for a close look for his role in the housing meltdown, subprime outrage.</p>

		<p>Mr. Cao has more in common with Whites then the black candidate.  He is intelligent, Christian, and since he is republican may even have some love for our country and culture.  And just remember, if we hadn&rsquo;t blown his country up he wouldn&rsquo;t be here.  At least this form of blowback didn&rsquo;t involve bombs.  Count your blessings.</p>

		<p>In a textbook example of why modern Conservatism is a lost cause, I hear Laura Ingrahm speak to this issue on the radio just this evening. Although she was quick to point out that this guy was an admitted &#8220;moderate&#8221; with no real record to speak of, she was thrilled on the sole basis that he was:</p>
<p>a) A Republican<br/>
b) Pro-life/Catholic</p>
<p>This and fanaticism about &#8220;terror&#8221; seems to be largely what defines conservatism today. So long as you oppose abortion, and take a Coldwar-esque posture on national security, you are good-to-go. Even talk about the illegal invader tidal-wave has lessened considerably of late. Race is just off-limits with this crowd. Thus, a Vietnamese is just peachy with conservaties - much like their beloved Bobby Jindal, Michael Steele, Condi Rice, Powel, etc. Don&rsquo;t fall for it folks - movement conservatism is no friend to the White Race, no matter how much you may want to believe they are! </p>

To which he replied, &#8220;No Grandma, I&rsquo;m a Maoist Communist.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>I&rsquo;m with flamethrower on this one.  In light of the atrocities committed by the U.S. against Vietnam, we have no griping rights about them coming here as refugees or being elected to office.  If you want your country to be homogeneous, don&rsquo;t do what the U.S. did in Vietnam.</p>

<p>   Your darn right HH; we shouldn&rsquo;t forget it. I will vote for a candidate that supports some of our key interests, but I don&rsquo;t kid myself that they are for our cause. Anyone who advances our interests even slightly in this anti-white environment should get our support. However, it&rsquo;s too early for pro white candidates to  gain office. We will need a huge economic meltdown for that. </p>

		<p>Although Mr. Cao is a superior representative than the corrupt, odious Congressman Jefferson, he almost certainly will be a one-term wonder.  Disgusted with Jefferson, white liberals turned out in comparative droves to vote for Cao.  Generally, blacks stayed home election day after a Friday night of Remy Martin and Colt 45 Malt Liquor.  In 2010, a black liberal Democrat, probably a woman, will defeat Mr. Cao by at least ten points and probably more.  Cao might not even run again.  Louisiana loses a congressional seat in 2012 and the Civil Rights Acts pretty much will force the Lousiana legislature to form a black majority district by combining New Orleans with black sections of Baton Rouge and some heavily black rural counties in NE Louisiana.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see what the big deal is.  Cao is certainly better qualified than that crook Jefferson.  This has little to do with race and more to do with people being sick or corrupt politicians.  The fact that white voters turned out in force to oust a corrupt black politician is a good thing as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>

<p>I agree with you wholeheartedly. The so called conservative movement has absolutely nothing to do with white survival and the issues that are destroying whites which are:</p>
<p>(1) 45 years of affirmative action </p>
<p>(2) Uncontrolled and government sanctioned black on white crime</p>
<p>(3) Demographic displacement</p>
<p>(4) Hate and exterminate whites propaganda promoted not just by extremist racists like Tim Wise and Morris Dees, but by every <br/>
K-12 and university curriculm.</p>
<p>Conservatives are not our friends.  Conservatives and the Catholic church love hispanics because hispanics claim to be <br/>
against abortion.  Yet hispanics have the highest rate of abortion.  Where&rsquo;s the logic in that?</p>
<p>Since the election I have been getting e-mails from various conservative organizations about rebuilding the Republican party, preparing for 2012, on and on.</p>
<p>Most of the organizations set out 10 or 12 goals.  Not once has affirmative action or black on white crime been mentioned.  It&rsquo;s always anti gay, anti abortion as the main issues.  Then they mention less government regulation of business, strong defense blah blah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again.  We are not conservatives.  We are white survivalists fighting for the survival of the white race in the face of a government, a monopoly media, an educational system and an entire network of elites dedicated to our extermination.</p>
<p>Conservatives stood by and watched 60 years of rampant black on white crime.  Conservatives stood by and watched while our children were beaten and terrorized by feral black youth in the public schools and did nothing.  Conservatives have applauded as affirmative action morphed into no quotas for whites whatsoever.</p>
<p>Being pro business, conservatives love the invasion of our country by their beloved illegal alien work force.</p>
<p>Our enemies are liberals.  But remember, the anti abortion, anti gay, anti porn, pro military and strong national defense conservatives are not our friends just because they are the enemies of liberals.</p>
<p>I want to gag every time I see one of those strong national defense pro military positions.  Why should whites join the military and advocate to defend a country whose government hates us and wants to exterminate us?   Did the Kulaks being exterminated by Lenin and Stalin love their nation?  Certainly not and neither should we.</p>
<p>Our government was taken over 50 years ago by white hating liberals and we owe it nothing, certainly not defending its invade the world, invite the world policies.</p>
<p>At the present time and for the foreseeable future, we are impotent and helpless against the anti white government juggernaut.  All we can do is to try to raise consciousness about black on white crime and affirmative action.</p>
<p>We should be like the NRA.  They have their issue, the 2nd amendment.  Our issue should be restoring the equal protection of the 14th amendment to whites.</p>
<p>One of the emails I got from some Republican organization was titled &#8220;Encouraging News!&#8221;  The encouraging news was that their survey showed that white republicans and black democrats had the same views on gay marriage.</p>
<p>Such thinking is useless to whites who want equal access to jobs, college, government benefits and protection from black on white crime.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t be fooled by conservatives.  They will not and do not wish to help us.  All they want is our money for their fundraising and votes for their candidates.  And once elected, their candidates will betray us as did Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, Bush I and Bush II. <br/>

		<p>Mr Cao is a breath of fresh air to us that live in Louisiana. He won in a majority black district. Jefferson was a crook and barely lost. One does not have to be white to share our common values. Louisiana is majority black, we need to focus on the districts were we are the majority and start there. As for New Orleans, who cares what happens it won&rsquo;t affect many of us whites anyway.</p>

		<p>Voting for the worst of two evils=voting fof the death of Native Born White America. The Vietnamese are another post-1965 non-white racial group that Native Born White Americas-real Americans-are competing with for the scarce resources of America.</p>
<p>When Chris Mathews was very briefly critical of post-1965 immigration policy he said the following on the post-BIG IMMIGRATION DEBATE  call-in segement back in 1995 on CNBC in repsonse to a Native Born White American Male caller who had two daughters attetnding SUNY Binghamtom:&#8221;You know it is really outrageous that Binghamton gives a free ride to Vietnamese immgrants and a working class White guy has gotta pay through the nose&#8221;. This is pretty close to what Chris Mathews said. I&#8221;m sure Peter Brimelow has a transcript of this. These days Chris Mathews along Kieth Oberman are co-presidents of the Barack Obama worshipping society.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese &#8220;Americans &#8221; are not OUR allies. Keep them out. Repatriate the rest back to Vietnam. Anti-warism should be fundamantal to White Nationalism.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m often surprised by the animus displayed on this site toward Asians.  One would think that Mr. Cao is precisely the sort of immigrant this country would want.  Vietnamese and other East Asians are family oriented, have a strong work ethic, are generally law-abiding, have higher average IQs than whites, and usually make highly productive value-added citizens.  There&rsquo;s no question that this country has a huge and intractable minority problem with black Africans and Hispanics.  I&rsquo;d happily welcome all the East Asians we can get, if only to offset the social and economic costs of blacks and Hispanics.</p>

<p>Although Anh Cao came to the US when Viet Nam was conquered in 1975 at the age of 8, he married a Vietnamese woman and makes his living as…an immigration lawyer, presumably acting mainly for his own community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cao went to Washington to advocate for refugees. Recognizing he lacked necessary legal skills, he returned to New Orleans to attend Loyola University&rsquo;s law school. He worked for an immigrant advocacy group, then opened a law practice with a similar focus.</p>
<p>Though Cao described himself as a longtime Republican  &mdash;  he opposes abortion, supports school vouchers and wants to shrink the size of government  &mdash;  he ran as an independent. He concedes it a matter of &ldquo;political maneuvering&rdquo; in an effort to appeal to the district&rsquo;s mostly Democratic electorate…</p>
<p>Cao, vying to become the first Vietnamese-American elected to Congress, said that if he wins, he&rsquo;ll join the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.&rdquo; [Newcomer Joseph Cao hopes to unseat U.S. Rep. William Jefferson, by Michelle Krupa, The Times-Picayune, December1, 2008]</p>
<p>The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus is, naturally, an ethnic Asian special interest pressure group.</p>
<p>Probably the most sagacious comment on the election comes from the rabidly-Open-Borders Greg Siskind&rsquo;s Blog</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is set to become the first Vietnamese-American ever elected to Congress. He&rsquo;s also likely to be one of the most pro-immigration Republicans in Congress. Given the make up of the district and the enormous advantage a scandal-free Democrat will have in 2010, I&rsquo;m wondering whether Cao will remain a Republican. He&rsquo;s run previously as an independent. If I were Nancy Pelosi, I&rsquo;d invite Congressman Cao out to lunch.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Will Cao work in the interests of Whites?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t count on it. Cao worked..&#8221;for an immigrant advocacy group, then opened a law practice with a similar focus&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>In fact&hellip;&#8221;After witnessing dire poverty during mission trips to Mexico and Hong Kong&hellip;Cao went to Washington to advocate for refugees&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Are the citizens of Louisiana ready to welcome more refugees into their state?  Is that what you voted for?</p>
<p>The Times-Picayune also reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Cao offered thanks to the local immigrant community, and he made a special plea for peace in the country of his birth.<br/>
&#8216;I&rsquo;d like to thank my Vietnamese community,&rsquo; he said, &#8216;and I&rsquo;d like to encourage young Vietnamese in this country to work peacefully for a free and democratic Vietnam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;I will have pull with the members of Congress who represent the 1.5 million Vietnamese in this country,&rsquo; Cao said. &#8216;I will have political clout.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.nola.com/elections/index.ssf/2008/12/newcomer_joseph_cao_hopes_to_u.html</p>
<p>Patrick Cleburne over at Vdare.com rightly asks: Why should White Americans not have the same?</p>
<p>Sardonicus is also correct when he points out:  Do not kid yourself that they are for our cause.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.After witnessing dire poverty during mission trips to Mexico and Hong Kong&hellip;.[He left]the Jesuits and pursued another path to social change: politics. </p>
<p>Cao went to Washington to advocate for refugees&hellip;&#8221;<br/>

		<p>  More than likely it appears once again conservatives were force to vote for the lesser of two evils . I can not even begin to fathom the plummet of Western civilization . We are little more than a fond memory among those old enough to remember . As for our white, European youth, they have been brainwashed and absorbed into a litany of non-European cultures .

<p>Native Born White Americans not interchangeable with asian immigrants  street by street by street,town by town,city by city and state by state. White Nationalist do not want to import any non-white immigrants into America. There is no economic,cultural,environmental and ecological reason for for importing asians into America. Asians are not natural allies of Native Born Whie Americans. They do not harbor benign intentions towards Native Born White Americans. Native Born White Americans should not be forced to competet for  the scarce resoures of America-especially California-with asian immigrants and their &#8220;American&#8221; born gene-line.</p>
<p>If you are an asianphile..go live in Asia. The &#8220;high IQ&#8221; asians have built &#8220;lovely&#8221; nations for all you asianphiles to live in..so leave US alone and. Don&rsquo;t force asia on  the rest of us.</p>
<p>Question:How did Native Born White Americans survive for decades and decades without the &#8220;super smart&#8221; asian immigrant and its &#8220;american&#8221; born geneline? Very well thank you.</p>
<p>America is not an idea nation. The racial composition of America is the fundamental issue. Race Realist such as Joe are clearly on board with the program to reduce Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d happily welcome all the East Asians we can get, if only to offset the social and economic costs of blacks and Hispanics.<br/>

<p>You&rsquo;re not real familiar with the Asian Way are you John.</p>
<p>All News Web ^ | 9-12-2008 | Audrey Chan<br/>
Police in Ho Chi Minh City,Vietnam raiding a brothel where alleged human rights abuses were taking place have made a shocking discovery: Dog cages </p>
<p>Some one this website stated that asians are to business crime and corruption as blacks are to violent street crime.So very true.</p>
<p>Try applying to college or grad school John.  Watch less qualified asians, especially asian women get the place you should have gotten by merit.</p>
<p>Become genuinely disabled John.  Then see if you can get SSI disability payments or even medicaid coverage.  You&rsquo;ll be denied because you are white.  While you are going through the process, you will see numerous perfectly healthy asian immigrants being quickly granted those benefits because they are shepherded through the application process by one of their taxpayer immigrant aid organizations.</p>
<p>My main objection to asian immigration is they are just one more race that gets affirmative action advantages as whites are banned from employment, government benefits and college admission.</p>

		<p>Jupiter - America&rsquo;s not an idea nation?  That&rsquo;s precisely what it is.  It was established on the basis of ideas as set down in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  It&rsquo;s not successful based on its racial composition.  If it were, how can you explain the relative lack of prosperity and social development in so many other white nations, such as Spain, the former USSR, the Balkans, the Middle East, Italy south of Rome, etc.?</p>
<p>We are a hugely successful economic, social, and cultural experiment that happened to be started by white Europeans, white Europeans who broke off violently from their forebears.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll concede that virtually all the technological, social, cultural, and scientific progress, beginning with the Renaissance, has the been the work of white European males and their American descendents.  That&rsquo;s simply a matter of historical fact, though like so many other inconvertible facts it would be hysterically denied if uttered in any mainstream forum. Whether this reality is a function of political awakening and timing or of superior creativity in Caucasions (I suspect possibly a combination of both) is a fit topic for discussion.</p>
<p>More than any other immigrant group, East Asians share our cultural values of hard work, family cohesion, respect for elders, and free enterprise.  In fact, given the results of the last election, these values would appear to be fading among a good many whites.</p>
<p>In any event, we do have a serious minority problem, largely homegrown and more recently in the form of hordes of Hispanics, both legal and illegal.  Given the current white birth rate, I maintain that we could well use all the East Asian immigrants we can attract.</p>

<p>Why did this universalist, based-on-a-proposition nation limit immigration and citizenship in its first national law concerning immigration (1790) to &#8220;free white persons?&#8221; </p>

<p>But once they arrive in this country they are given affirmative action privileges.</p>
<p>This means that our government demands and requires that Asians be given preference over better qualified whites in college admissions and jobs.</p>
<p>Give your job to an affirmative action Asian John.  Give your child&rsquo;s college place to an affirmative action Asian John.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t give my job and my child&rsquo;s college place and future job to an affirmative action Asian.</p>
<p>What kind of work do you do John, certainly not medicine, engineering, Information Technology, computer programming or any kind of scientific work.  If you were in those fields you would be aware that those jobs are given to affirmative action Asians, preferably female Asians while better qualified white Americans, especially men are denied employment in those fields because of their race and gender.</p>

		<p>Cassiodorus - Hmm, good point.  I forgot about that one.  Well, not every argument is without flaws, though I suspect that the 1790 immigration restriction was intended mainly to forestall black African or possibly Central Asian immigration.  I doubt that East Asia was on anybody&rsquo;s mind at that point, though admittedly if it were they probably wouldn&rsquo;t have written the law any differently.</p>

		<p>Vietnamese in Australia have ruined neighbouhoods with drugs especially. 1 in every 19 have a criminal record.There has only been one political assasination in Australia, and the people responsible for that are a gang of Vietnamese<br/>
For some to say Viets are ok, only make me wonder what alternative the voters had.</p>

<p>The most cursory research on this topic will reveal that until quite recently the idea that the US was a white nation for white people was thoroughly uncontroversial. No president up to and including Eisenhower would have disagreed; your theory is the historical abberation.</p>
