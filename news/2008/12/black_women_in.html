<h1>Black Women in the U.S. Appear to Be Shrinking</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Hundley, Chicago Tribune, December 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Call her The Incredible Shrinking African-American Woman.</p>
<p>In an age when the adult populations of most industrialized nations have grown significantly taller, the average height of black women in the U.S. has been receding, beginning with those born in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>The difference in stature between white women and black women has now stretched to three-quarters of an inch and appears to be increasing, according to newly released data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The average height of a black woman born in the 1980s is just under 5 feet 4 inches; her mother, born in the 1960s, is more than half an inch taller. Even her grandmother, born in the 1940s, is a bit taller. The average white woman born in the 1980s is about half an inch taller than her mother.</p>
<p>The gap is &#8220;truly phenomenal,&#8221; according to John Komlos, an economist and historian who has made a specialty of studying human heights. &#8220;Such a steep decline is practically unprecedented in modern U.S. history.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Komlos&rsquo; latest findings, based on the NHANES data, suggest that after nearly 25 years of stagnation, the average height of adult Americans born from 1975 to 1986 has edged up again &mdash; with the exception of black women, whose height is moving in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The reason this matters, according to Komlos, is because &#8220;height is a very good overall indicator of how well the human organism thrives in its socioeconomic environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>His argument is bolstered by another discovery: While the heights of low- and middle-income black women are plummeting, upper-income black women are growing taller and rapidly closing the gap with their white counterparts.</p>
<p>An individual&rsquo;s height is fixed mainly by genes, but the average height of different categories of people is determined to a large extent by external factors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also baffling, Adler [Nancy Adler, director of the MacArthur Foundation&rsquo;s Research Network on Socioeconomic Status and Health] said, is the disparity between black men and black women, &#8220;since they are subject to the same pre-birth conditions&#8221; and then grow up in the same environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only reasonable explanation we can come up with is diet and the obesity epidemic among [middle- and low-income] black women,&#8221; said Komlos.</p>
<p>Over the last three decades, the prevalence of obesity among white Americans has tripled, while among blacks it has increased fivefold.</p>
<p>Black females were hardest hit: Almost 80 percent of black females are overweight or obese, compared with 62 percent of the total female population, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another oddity, according to Komlos, is that black children, both male and female, grow faster and taller than their white counterparts in early childhood, but whites catch up and pass them during the teen years.</p>
<p>Pediatric growth experts offer one possible explanation. High caloric intake from an unhealthy diet fuels an early growth spurt among black children, plus it speeds the onset of puberty, especially for black girls, who now begin menstruating 81/2 months ahead of white girls. This early onset of puberty reduces the duration of the critical pre-adolescent growth spurt, resulting in a lower adult height.</p>

		<p>They seem to write as if the idea that the races might have inherently different growth patterns is totally unthinkable.  As if even admitting that much would throw open the door to eugenicists, Nazis, and what ever.  In my opinion it is probably merely a coincidence that whites and blacks have approximately the same average adult height, but I think it should be fairly uncontroversial to notice that the growth patterns are somewhat different; even child development textbooks used in left-wing university classrooms will tell you that.</p>
<p>Other than that, the article is probably pretty much on the money: fast food is unhealthy and an unhealthy diet can cause people to get shorter.  This article focusses on women but I&rsquo;ve seen other studies show that black men are also getting shorter:  <a href="https://halls.md/on/men-height-b.htm" rel="nofollow">https://halls.md/on/men-height-b.htm</a></p>
<p>Since men don&rsquo;t keep growing until age 37, it stands to reason that the peak height being that far down the curve is due to poor nutrition stunting growth especially among the younger generations.  However the halls.md page does show that white men are also shrinking slightly, on the order of about half an inch: <a href="https://halls.md/chart/men-height-w.htm" rel="nofollow">https://halls.md/chart/men-height-w.htm</a></p>

The object of this article is to reveal that most &#8220;Black&#8221; women in America are obese. Because the writer is politically correct, though - and in order to keep his job - he cannot directly say so. Rather, he must muddle up by such esoteric sounding nonsense as:</p>
<p>&ldquo;height is a very good overall indicator of how well the human organism thrives in its socioeconomic environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can blame the writer? Times are tough. Good jobs are hard to find.</p>

<p>Do not believe such statements from racist physicians.  We know from reliable sources (NAACP, Jessie Jackson, US Department of Education, Black web-sites, etc.) that the main reason for Black failure in education is because of the lack of food at home.   Black children are starving, and that is why they cannot do homework, study, learn, or behave in class.  This lack of food (withheld from them by racist Whites), causes them to watch massive amounts of TV, have unprotected sex, and commit crimes at 5 times the rate of Whites and Asians.  Only by instituting 24/7 free feeding programs can we finally solve the social pathologies of African Americans and overcome our racist past.  All city buses, subways, crack houses, housing projects, and schools must have free meals available NOW!  Stop the hate!</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it obvious? Evil white scientists must have dreamed-up nefarious methods of deliberately altering the genetic structure of black women through food additives - just to make them more obese than white women!</p>
<p>Just wait, some &#8220;great thinker&#8221; in Africa will soon tell us all about this sinister plot, without a shred of scientific evidence to back it up, of course.</p>

		<p>First there was the poverty gap, the SAT gap, the arrest and drug-sentencing gap, the home ownership gap, and now we can wring our hands over the height gap. And I guess we should add the obesity, AIDS, herpes, high blood pressure, lung cancer and murder gaps. <br>

The key piece of information is there in the last paragraph: It is a genetic difference which brings early onset of puberty, which stops a growth spurt that occurs before puberty starts.</p>
<p>On another note, for fun, try making this statement in the presence of liberals and see the reaction:  &#8220;Almost 80 percent of black females are overweight or obese.&#8221;</p>

		<p>While the height differences between black and white women are subtle, these days the weight differences are not. I can easily believe that 80% of them are now overweight. Granted the US population as a whole is growing larger, but black women clearly seem to be leading the way in that department. I think it goes deeper than just eating habits, and lifestyle. There is a tendency among black women to almost make being overweight a desirable thing. Plump and even downright fat women, are often called thick instead, and it is made out to be sexy, and rolls of flesh are often referred to as curves instead. With the glamourization of fat in their culture, no wonder they are growing bigger. </p>

<p>That is quite disgraceful as well.  We want at least 80% of both males and females to be healthy and proportional.  And the above indicates only 38% of all females in North America are not obese!!   I do not mean females should avoid being obese for the benefit of the eyes of men.  Being obese can lead to various diseases.  </p>

		<p>This phenomenon is especially clear here in NYC where most people are quite thin from all the walking we do. However, black women are the exception. Even young black women are fat. And being in NYC makes their obesity all the more apparent. </p>
<p>Walking behind them on a crowded sidewalk or up stairs when exiting the subway is a nightmare. You should see them too. Sometimes they have to stop for breath when walking up stairs or if the escalator is broken. I think about them as I go on my nightly run- how&rsquo;s that for motivation!</p>
<p>And who pays for their medical bills? In NY state it&rsquo;s part of our state constitution that medical assistance is provided to all. So any low income individual gets free medical care including prescriptions. Universal healthcare is going to be a way to subsidize gluttons, smokers, drug addicts and alcoholics. However, I remain a staunch advocate of free abortions and I think abortion should be encouraged and promoted as the right thing to do.</p>

		<p>Could this be because of genetic factors after all?  Here&rsquo;s a brainstorm.</p>
<p>Most black Americans are partially white, and those with more &#8220;white&#8221; genes are I think a little taller than those that have only a few.  </p>
<p>I think that the population explosion of the black underclass is actually diluting the amount of white genes in the black community, which should make blacks shorter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that the article doesn&rsquo;t have stats for black men.  Perhaps they are shrinking too, just not as fast as black women.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black females were hardest hit&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why is that whenever there is a discussion of preventable illnesses, diseases, violent crimes, non-violent crimes, ill-advised loans, illegitimate births, socio-economic status, education results, illicit drug use, teenage pregnancy, or incarceration, the term &#8220;Blacks were hardest hit&#8221; always surfaces?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s perform a Google search on the terms Blacks &#8220;hardest hit&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?ie=&amp;oe=&amp;q=blacks+%22hardest+hit%22" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/search?ie=&oe;=&q;=blacks+%22hardest+hit%22</a></p>
<p>The search yields 262,000 results. African-Americans &#8220;hardest hit&#8221; yields an additional 22,000 results.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;hit&#8221; implies a defenseless victimization. Think about that for a moment&hellip;</p>
<p>Blacks are afforded every privilege, special consideration, and benefit of the doubt under the sun. How could a race that is virtually guaranteed of a favorable outcome still fare so poorly? How many of the Black community&rsquo;s problems could be alleviated if they simply followed the guidance of the constantly doting Whites Liberals who employee nonstop interventionism, at my expense, to ensure Blacks are not &#8220;hit&#8221;?</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Instead of sitting on the sofa in a bathrobe and corn-rolls all day, while waiting for their next welfare check and listening to Oprah tell them how victimized they are, maybe these Black women would lose some weight if they put down the Big Macs and ran around the block a time or two twice a day while seeking steady employment.<br>

<p>Hasn&rsquo;t that always been the case?</p>
<p>Evolutionary theory predicts that females would store fat in order to survive.  Their reproduction function requires additional nourishment so stored fat between births is an evolutionary winning strategy.  The charming waist to hip ratio that entices a man cannot be easily maintained after childbirth.</p>
<p>Natural hormonal secretions are why older women and primitive women are fat.  The slim woman is a new development.  Men are puzzled by the degeneration that their women undergo after just a few years of marriage.  Women survival hormones contribute to women fattiness and their succumbing to the temptations of feminism.    </p>
<p>A wise culture takes precautions against these un-stabilizing  occurrences.<br>

		<p>Hey, look at the bright side, Bantu America. During the 1960&rsquo;s, you convinced Congress and the Johnson regime that you people were one missed meal away from death by starvation. The result was free food programs, free school lunch programs for Bantu rugrats, etc. Now 80% of Bantu women are overweight or obese.</p>
<p>Death by starvation will never hit American Bantus, now. It&rsquo;ll play a part in their mother continent, though. Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, the new South Africa, Congo, etc. </p>

		<p>But earlier puberty of black girls in the US has been already noticed in a study made in the years 1988-1994, published in 2002:</p>
<p><i>RESULTS: Black and Mexican American girls had pubic hair and breast development and had achieved menarche at younger ages than white girls. For example, 49.4% of black girls aged 9 years had breast development compared with 24.5% of Mexican American girls and 15.8% of white girls. The mean age at onset of pubic hair, breast development, and menarche was 9.5, 9.5, and 12.1 year for black girls; 10.3, 9.8, and 12.2 years for Mexican American girls; and 10.5, 10.3, and 12.7 years for white girls. These ethnic differences remained even after adjustment for current body mass index and several social and economic variables. CONCLUSION: Black girls on average enter puberty first, followed by Mexican American and then white girls.</i></p>
<p>Interestingly, a study comparing black and white girls in South Africa from the year 1987 says quite the opposite:<br>
<i>A study of the sexual maturation of 362 black and 355 white girls was conducted in Johannesburg in 1976 and 1977. It was found that the first sign of breast development occurs at the same mean age of 11.5 years for both groups, but that white girls develop pubic hair and experience menarche some 9 months earlier than black girls. The menarche in black girls occurs at a younger age than that recorded in the 1960s. The average black girl reaches full maturity later and has a longer maturational period than her white contemporary. In addition the time-span between maturational events in black girls differs from that in white girls.</i></p>

		<p>Just riding the Washington Metro subway from New Carrollton, MD to Farragut West in Downtown DC I can see how obese most black women are.  When one of these humungous women sit next to you on the train, you are often rewarded with buttocks overhanging your lap.  No kidding.  They care not about invading your space.</p>
<p>Washington, DC used to have a radio doctor, Dr. Gabe Mirkin, who took phone calls.  Invariably, black women would call and they would explain that they were told by their doctors that they had cholestrol problems that required diets.  Dr. Mirkin would ask their heights and weights.  The women would comply, usually after saying that they really weren&rsquo;t too overweight.  And then they would pronounce themselves at some ridiculous combination of, say, 5&rsquo;4&#8221; and 220 lbs. Dr. Mirkin would dutifully explain as a mother to a child that they were dangerously overweight.  The black women callers seemed truly mystified that they were obese.   </p>

		<p>just hang around a high school at lunch time. African American and to a slightly lower extent, Hispanic, kids are where? In the cafeteria eating their subsidized meals(which I admit aren&rsquo;t all that nutritious). NO. They are clustered around the candy machines that litter out urban high schools allegedly to finance after school and athletic activities. The munchkins take their nutritious candy and other junk into the classroom where they eat away, share with other students, and then litter the floor with wrappers. Another distraction from learning, along with the expensive Ipods and phones with email capacity these children of poverty lug into the classroom. Of course they &#8216;forget&rsquo; their books in their lockers. they say they can&rsquo;t &#8220;wait&#8221; in line to be served their taxpayer paid for meals which of course are tossed out.</p>
<p>Potato chips, many bags of which are bought, are also a favorite. And oh yes, while practically none of these scholars raise their hands to answer questions on the reading assignments, which of course they never do, they do march up to teachers and demand the teacher either just give them a dollar or give them change for a ten or a twenty so they can buy more junk during the day.  </p>
<p>Try writing Obama&rsquo;s Education Secretary, the Superintendant of the wonderful Chicago schools. about what he intends to do about all this. I mean eventually the candy and junk machines will &#8220;thin&#8221; out the population, but probably not for a few generations. Any food science readers out there may want to apply for a grant to follow the &#8220;March of the Penguins&#8221; in our high schools in Obama land.</p>

		<p>Now suppose you replaced the word &ldquo;height&rdquo; with &ldquo;IQ&rdquo;. Could the same type of article be written? You and I both know the answer is no.</p>
<p>Posted by thepainster at 8:49 AM on December 30 </p>
<p>&gt; Short people got no reason to live&hellip;.  </p>
<p>I thought I would take a digression in the subject of height in culture.</p>
<p>I am short, 5&rsquo;6&#8221; yet have a repeatedly tested IQ of 136.  I didn&rsquo;t do well in basketball, but found other individual sports where I excelled.  In fact, I had a 25 year athletic career that only ended due to my professional career demands.  I still compete in senior competition  I competed in three sports where being short (okay, not a midget) is not a limitation and I did very well in all of them.  I competed against tall people and loved to show them that size did not matter as much as over estimating yourself.</p>
<p>Ever whatch that recent series &#8220;Fear Factor&#8221; where men and women with smaller and more skilled hands were able to get out of traps when big, muscular guys just fumbled as the clock ran out?  Who do you think builds Swiss watches or jewelry, developes fine arts and literature - big, clods who can win at football or basketball, or a dimutive artist or scientist.  The classic historian of the Roman Empire Gibbon was a very small man.  So small in fact that he was a complete social failure until his history finally got published.  Should I mention Einstein?</p>
<p>In college, a very clever AND short instructor of physics once spent a lecture proving that according to the laws of physics, the longest lived people are shorter ones with short women outliving short men by a few years.  Basically, the heart has to pump more blood further distances and that wear the system down sooner.  Then there are other biomechanical problems that cause skeletal problems sooner.  Shorter people are also easier keepers and survive in famine better.  Historically, in inland regions, short people reign.  In jungles, people tend to be shorter, guess why?  So tall people, don&rsquo;t be so smug.</p>
<p>I always suspected, but only when I lived and worked in Eastern Europe did I find how much shorter people - especially men - are discriminated against in North America because in the Slavic world, merit seemed to carry much more weight, especially with women looking for a husband.  In the US and Northern Europe, there does seem to be a built in bias for tall people.  But studies of Viking ships have shown that the Vikings were shorter people - the oar holes accomodate shorter men.  Growth hormone is good, but only to a point.  I am not saying that a couple more inches would have been welcomed by me, but I made the best of who I am and did not do bad.  But I had to contstantly battle a very palpable and continued underestimation by strangers.  I still do enjoy confounding them.  For some reason, big people seem to have an assumption that being big makes them better, deserving place or prominence.  I will concede that statuesque people are impressive, but we ought to attempt to keep that perception in balance.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it obvious? Evil white scientists must have dreamed-up nefarious methods of deliberately altering the genetic structure of black women through food additives - just to make them more obese than white women!</p>
<p>Just wait, some &ldquo;great thinker&rdquo; in Africa will soon tell us all about this sinister plot, without a shred of scientific evidence to back it up, of course.</p>

<p>Janelle  &mdash;  It IS a sinister plot. Wise Bar-B-Que Tata chips and Church&rsquo;s fried chicken are the primary carriers of the genetic compounds that are causing this to happen.<br>

		<p>This is really no surprise. All you have to do is take a bus or subway ride in Chicago and see how morbidly obese these Black women and their children. They are usually eating out of McDonald&rsquo;s packages and devouring the French Fries. They should make them pay for two fares since they take up two seats! A friend of mine who is an expert in human behavior explained it to me some years ago. He said that since most Black men are violent and criminal, Black women don&rsquo;t want much to do with them. They become matriarchal and protective of their children. Black men are forced to go elsewhere for sex which explains why many go on the &#8220;down low.&#8221; As a result, since they don&rsquo;t have to worry about attracting partners, all they do is eat. I&rsquo;ve seen Black women buying high sugar colas, potatoe chips and candy and other junk food while they use their food stamps debit card to pay for their purchases. It&rsquo;s no wonder they&rsquo;re lazy and obese.</p>

		<p>It is worth noting that according to that concocted mass-delusion known as &#8220;African-American culture,&#8221; that Black women fully believe themselves beautiful and desirable, apparently no matter how fat they get! They celebrate their obesity, attaching all manner of ghetto vulgarisms and slang terminology to their condition in order to convince those around them how &#8220;sexy&#8221; or what have you, they really are. </p>
<p>Sadly, this is probabaly just one more reason black males flock to white women!! </p>
<p>To be fair, white girls these days are plenty plump on average themsleves, but nothing compared to Blacks. </p>

		<p>If indeed black women are growing shorter by an inch or so while everyone else is getting taller, does anyone really think the mainstream media is going to come up with a factual explanation (if we can trust the figures in the first place)? No, the average reader doesn&rsquo;t expect a real explanation forthcoming. Merely a distraction and an exercise in examining the evidence they do offer. I dare say even liberal readers aren&rsquo;t expecting the truth here, or accuracy. Yet we are all willing to argue about the &#8216;findings&rsquo; here. Is it any wonder truth is a forgotten virtue. An inconvenience? </p>

		<p>This is true, but the frightening figure is that 62% of all US women are fatties. Granted, no doubt it&rsquo;s a similar figure for US men, but I&rsquo;m not looking to sleep with them. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the over-50 age group. Even just looking at the over-50 White women, way too many of them look like they just swallowed a Right Whale.</p>

		<p>Black females were hardest hit: Almost 80 percent of black females are overweight or obese </p>
<p>And an even greater number of them are in denial about it. After a health report was released on the net a couple of years back, about the alarming number of black women who are overweight or obese, I remember how countless black women, angrily countered that black women should not be included in BMI charts, because they insisted, that black women carry their weight better, and are usually much more curvy, and well proportioned. <br>
But from seeing numerous overweight black women with my own eyes, I can state unequivocally, that most of them are NOT built like black Marilyn Monroe&rsquo;s. Sure, they have the generous hips and ample backsides, they are so proud of. But most of them also have large round bellies to go with it. Most are shaped like beach balls rather than hourglasses.</p>

		<p>&#8220;However, I remain a staunch advocate of free abortions and I think abortion should be encouraged and promoted as the right thing to do.&#8221;<br>
______________________________________________________</p>
<p>I have to disagree with this.  White women keep getting abortions, while Black women keep having children.  There have been about 30 million abortions since 1960; these White babies have been replaced by imported third-world immigrants.  There are tens of thousands (or more) White couples who would love to adopt a White baby but the demand is too great.  So they get a Black or Chinese baby instead.  Let the poor White women have the baby, and give it to a well-off White couple.<br>

		<p>Washington, DC used to have a radio doctor, Dr. Gabe Mirkin, who took phone calls. Invariably, black women would call and they would explain that they were told by their doctors that they had cholestrol problems that required diets. Dr. Mirkin would ask their heights and weights. The women would comply, usually after saying that they really weren&rsquo;t too overweight. And then they would pronounce themselves at some ridiculous combination of, say, 5&rsquo;4&rdquo; and 220 lbs. Dr. Mirkin would dutifully explain as a mother to a child that they were dangerously overweight. The black women callers seemed truly mystified that they were obese. </p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   </p>
<p>I remember reading a study about the differences in the perception of body image between black women, and white women. The study found that white women who were only moderately overweight, and sometimes not overweight at all, were more likely to describe themselves as more overweight than they actually were, or were more likely to have negative body images. </p>
<p>Whereas, black women were more likely to describe themselves as being at an ideal, and healthy weight, even when they were considerably overweight, and even clinically obese.  </p>
<p>Many black women see this as a healthy thing, reasoning that they are less likely to develop eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia. However, overeating is also a form of an eating disorder as well, and not a healthy either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all well and good for them that black culture rejects starvation dieting, but overeating is rarely discouraged, even when it is the point of gluttony.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Could this be because of genetic factors after all? Here&rsquo;s a brainstorm.</p>
<p>Most black Americans are partially white, and those with more &ldquo;white&rdquo; genes are I think a little taller than those that have only a few. </p>
<p>I think that the population explosion of the black underclass is actually diluting the amount of white genes in the black community, which should make blacks shorter.&#8221;</p>
<p>This explanation also coincides with the fact that Blacks are doing worse in school and becoming more violent. Black are in a state of dysgenics caused by the dissapearance and diminishing influence, both genetic and social of Whitey. We should consider Brazil and Zimbabwe as examples to study. </p>

<p>Not only a height gap, but a 1/2 inch height gap.  Oh the inhumanity of it all.  But billions of dollars spent on bogus studies employing a lot of useless liberal arts graduates should solve the problem. </p>
<p>By the way Mr. genius researcher, black girls have always menstruated earlier than white girls, just as the average 12 year old black boy is several inches taller and 20 pounds heavier than the average 12 year old white boy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;There is a tendency among black women to almost make being overweight a desirable thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have always thought that black women enjoy being overweight because it makes them big and imposing and thus better able to bully and intimidate others.  I have noticed that the fatter they are, the more agressive and domineering they are.</p>
<p>This includes all those affirmative action school principals and counselors as well as the project mamas</p>
<p>Fat black children love being fat because their greater size means they bully and beat other children more easily.  I am a teacher.  I have observed black children for 23 years.  The fat black girls are always the loudest, meanest and cruelest in the class. But then, black children are very cruel to each other.</p>
