<h1>Flint Mother Latrica Ryan of 10 Looks to Community for Help</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>RoNeisha Mullen, Flint (Michigan) Journal, November 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With 10 kids and no vehicle, Latrica Ryan is used to juggling.</p>
<p>Going to a movie or out for dinner is a like plotting a major tactical undertaking. Not that such outings happen that much.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would really be nice if I could take my kids where they needed to go, instead of having to find them a ride,&#8221; Ryan said. &#8220;And when we do go somewhere, I have to pay four or five people (for gas) to get us all there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have booster seats and car seats. It&rsquo;s a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ryan, is a 29-year-old single stay-at-home mother of five sons and five daughters, who range in age from 2 months to 13 years.</p>
<p>Transportation isn&rsquo;t the only issue Ryan has to deal with.</p>
<p>The Flint woman said she sometimes needs help providing her children with clothes and food.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ryan may not be able to take her kids on a fancy vacation, but with the help of organizations such as FACED Corporation, she is able to ensure that her kids&rsquo; basic needs are met.</p>
<p>The Flint-based agency has helped Ryan clothe and feed her children, as well as pay utility bills.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FACED is a faith-based community outreach agency that focuses on assisting the low-income. Dye said the agency helps educate mothers on parenting and provides them with things such as maternity clothes, baby clothes, other baby items, counseling and support groups.</p>

		<p>     Where&rsquo;s the father(s) ? Does providing her with basic needs include the purchase of condoms or birth control pills ? Oh, I forgot - she&rsquo;s probably a good Catholic and her religion forbids their use. Compare her with that white family with eighteen children. The white family is self-sufficient and probably doesn&rsquo;t cost the taxpayers a dime. Note the name of the author of this story. Are you crying crocodile tears yet ? Don&rsquo;t worry, Obama will give her everything she needs.</p>

		<p>Yes, there is FACED, but there are also the various fathers of these ten children.  On that subject, I want to ask AmReners this:  Does it seem to you that child support enforcement is, all other things equal, harder on whites than blacks?  I&rsquo;ll often see stories from black areas that mention a man with many children by many different women, or vice-versa.  I think to myself, where is Social Services et al. trying to bring child support orders?  Meanwhile, white guy who misses one check gets thrown in jail.</p>

		<p>Perhaps Laricia should have considered these problems after her third child. Or 5th. Or 8th. Amazing how these baby producers have all these kids with the full expectation that you and I will pick up the tab for everything. And why arent all her kids baby daddies supporting their offspring? </p>
<p>I wonder if this mother of the year candidate has been &#8220;fixed&#8221;, or can we expect that she will bre producing more bundles of joy that the American taxpayer will have to support? </p>

		<p>&#8220;It take a village to raise a child&#8221;.<br>
In this threads case literally.</p>
<p>I bumped into this story from my part of world and it first made me think of the Duggars. <br>
But I think this thread is more apt to post this link to. </p>
<p>&#8220;Parents take 14 hours to realise 14 hours that their son is missing&#8221;<br>
http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/local/5227972/pair-realise-son-missing-14-hours-later/</p>
<p>Dandenong the area mentioned in this story is one of Melbournes &#8216;multicultural success stories&rsquo; with 41 different languages spoken according to their local council.<br>
And these guys have (only?) eight kids. <br>
My partner and I have two kids and they are running us raggered.<br>
You must have to be so very organised with these amounts of children.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Stay at home mom&#8221;?  Try stereotypical black welfare queen.  Short sighted with no common sense, no concern for improving herself or her children&rsquo;s lot.  Nope- her only concern is getting that gubmint check and having whitey pay every bill she and her litter will ever incur.</p>
<p>When will the media begin to portray these people as they really are, instead of the witty, upwardly mobile and affluent blacks we see on virtually every TV commercial?  </p>

		<p>I hope that this is an attempt by the authors of American Renaissance to expose the hypocrites among its readers   &mdash;   those who will shower praise upon a family of eighteen white children but express only shame and disgust at the sight of a family of ten academically successful and law-abiding children led by a devoted and loving mother simply because she is unmarried and because she is black.</p>
<p>Anyone who does feel that way is merely adding to the stereotype against us.  Please, try to get over the hate; hateful people can do nothing good for anybody.</p>

		<p>&#8220;With 10 kids and no vehicle, Latrica Ryan is used to juggling.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;   my guess is that it was too much &#8220;juggling&#8221; that got her into this mess in the first place. 10 kids, no Father/ Husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Flint woman said she sometimes needs help providing her children with clothes and food.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;   This probably should have occured to her after babies 3 and 4 and definately before 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10!</p>
<p>&#8220;The Flint-based agency has helped Ryan clothe and feed her children, as well as pay utility bills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, yessss, bail-outs for all but the productive (as opposed to the merely re-productive) and self-reliant in society. Makes sense right? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I just cannot feel sympathy for the mother who cannot keep her legs closed and on welfare.  I wish she get a job and be responsible for her problem kids instead of having the government and hard-working White taxpayers of Michigan having to support that so-called family.</p>
<p>These single-parent households are the biggest source of social problems today.  Illegal immigration is another.</p>

		<p>This is why I always have been, and always will be, pro-choice. In fact, I think abortion should be encouraged and promoted as an acceptable and ethical form of birth control- especially in minority communities.</p>
<p>How much will this woman&rsquo;s offspring really cost us as taxpayers? We&rsquo;ll have to pay for their upbringing and then that of their children. <br>

		<p>Thanks to Gov. Granholm (D) of Michigan, there is no limit as to how long you can stay on welfare, or how many children you can have  I&rsquo;m sure like many other Black&rsquo;s they are taught you are entitled to this because of &#8220;slavery&#8221;, or maybe it&rsquo;s because there is a 47% adult illiteracy rate in MI.</p>

		<p>  Isn&rsquo;t is funny how a family of 18, like the Duggar family have no problem taking care of themselves without any public assistance what-so-ever and live a fantastic life. And then you have this family of 10 that lives off welfare and makes up the difference with public charity. Hmmm, would it be that these 10 kids have 10 different fathers, and still no man in the family? So basically, as long as she can pump them out, she can get more and more free money to live on. Unlike the Duggars, whom take care of themselves in all aspects of life. My own parents came from families of over 10 children, and they received no help from anybody. Hell, my grandparents would have been too proud to allow the state to raise their children. My father came from a family of 12 kids and my mother a family of 14 kids. They made it just fine, and they were raised during the darkest years of the depression. The welfare state has made slaves of all minorities with their free money and charity at the expense of the taxpayer. And at least a third of the white race. </p>

		<p>The Duggars just welcomed their eighteenth child and do not rely on government assistance.  All of the Duggar children have the same father, and he is still married to their mother.  Could there be more than a casual connection?</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m mean-spirited, thanks for noticing.  I&rsquo;m thinking fondly of this woman and her spawn and I do my year-end tax planning.</p>

		<p>Everyone mentions the babydaddies. Its just as much her as the daddies (and Im well aware of the shortcomings of blacks, male and female). </p>
<p>Consider putting aside your &#8216;women must be protected instincts&rsquo; and think: Maybe she kicked out the baby daddy, so she could fornicate with a new baby daddy?</p>
<p>As Daniel Amneus says in &#8220;The case for Father Custody&#8221; The black community is a model of matriarchy where the male is deprived of a socially useful role. And bear in mind, the white community is headed the same way.</p>
<p>Men cannot play the &#8216;Money Card&rsquo; because of welfare for the happily promiscuous moms, and because of forced child support, but women continue to happily play the &#8216;Child Welfare Card&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As soon as you give judges the right to decide for &#8216;the best interests of the child&rsquo; they give the child to the mom 95% of the time, even though it *should be 50/50 - same &#8216;protect females&rsquo; instinct at work. Thats why automatic father child custody is necessary - to counteract that instinct. </p>
<p>Men have been losing ground since 1860 when judges got this right. We need to role back the clock. </p>
<p>Its a good book, read it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot - she&rsquo;s probably a good Catholic and her religion forbids their use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stop with the Catholic bashing.  There is no reason for anyone practicing natural family planning, which uses God-created biological rhythms to limit fertility, to ever wind up with 10 children.  If this woman were Catholic, and observant enough to follow the Church&rsquo;s teachings on birth control, she would probably also be observant enough to follow the teachings on fornication.  She would probably have a husband to support the family and a normal family.  Blaming the Catholic Church for disasters like this is ridiculous.  </p>

Also, as the kiddies grow into criminal activity, I will see to it, that their victims are blamed, as you, being the model mother, did your level best to raise them, and I will get them bailed out so they can keep on killing, raping and selling dope.&#8221;  End of obammy&rsquo;s quote!</p>

		<p><i>Ryan may not be able to take her kids on a fancy vacation&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Fancy vacation, hell! In the immediately preceding paragraph (original article) she openly states that she sometimes runs too low on food to feed them!</p>
<p>Obscuratus-</p>
<p><i>I&rsquo;ll assume &ldquo;law-abiding&rdquo; though, as it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that the oldest, a 13 year old, would be a criminal much less so with the others&hellip;</i></p>
<p>While I see no reason to believe this particular brood contains any criminals and do not wish to infer as much, don&rsquo;t let mere age fool you. </p>
<p>When I lived in Baltimore there were numerous &#8220;open air&#8221; drug markets in my area. There were generally two types: drive-through setups (pay at one end of the alley then drive through and pick up your merchandise at the other), and hoppers/runners (pay the hopper, and the runner brings the merch to you). The runners are often grade-school aged children, in fact I&rsquo;ve never seen anything else. Being so young affords them a certain amount of immunity from prosecution, and they&rsquo;re the only ones that actually handle the contraband. </p>
<p>For that matter, the hoppers who run the corners are sometimes no more than young teenagers (13 is rare, but not unheard of). Look-out Boys (guess what they do) are usually elementary school children. </p>

		<p>Look I am not saying Latrica&rsquo;s family is the goal we should aspire all blacks to achieve, but only that most people here are being hypocritical for holding her family and the Duggars to different standards.</p>
<p>Neither a single-mom with 10 kids nor a two-parent family with 18 is anywhere near ideal.  Personally, I don&rsquo;t know which is worse.  In either case the older kids are going to miss out on their adolescence because they will be the ones taking care of the younger kids.  </p>
<p>Other articles on the Internet will tell you that Latrica Ryan actually does have a job; outside of a few cities with chronic unemployment problems, in order for one to earn food stamps, it&rsquo;s necessary to work at least 20 hours a week, and that&rsquo;s what she does.  </p>
<p>Also, in regards to those complaining about taxpayer money: it says nowhere in any of the articles about the Duggar family that I can find that they don&rsquo;t receive government benefits.  Since it&rsquo;s illegal to refuse child tax credits and the like, the question of whether they&rsquo;re being financed by taxpayers or not really just comes down to what their income level is.  If they&rsquo;re not rich, they&rsquo;re almost certainly getting some form of taxpayer-funded assistance.</p>
<p>And in any case, you&rsquo;re all ignoring the fact that the cost of a public school education absolutely dwarfs the amount of money that goes into food stamps, TANF, and the child tax credits.  A family with 18 kids that sends all of them to public school is going to cost the city&rsquo;s taxpayers $3 million, an amount far above and beyond anything that anyone could ever receive in the various forms of welfare combined.  Thus all families who send their children to public schools are using only slightly less taxpayer money than those who send their children to public schools <i>and</i> receive food stamps, TANF money, and/or &#8220;true&#8221; welfare assistance.</p>
<p>Why I described the kids as academically successful: it is mentioned that six of Latrica&rsquo;s ten children are on the honor roll at school, which, given their ages, means that essentially all of the ones that are old enough to get grades are getting good grades. Sure, it could be a predominantly black school with low standards, but even that means that they are ahead of all the other children in that school.  All in all, this family does not appear to meet the stereotype of the poor, useless 85-IQ black underclass.</p>

		<p>The reason there is so much welfare abuse is the stigma has almost been completely removed from having illegitimate children.  For thousands of years it was considered very shameful to have illegitimate children.  The word &#8220;bastard&#8221; was a terrible insult. </p>
<p>Nowadays it is anything goes.  In fact, by the tone of this article, it is presented as HONORABLE that this unwed mother is raising her children without any help from a husband.  Is this the new feminism, that men are unneeded except to pay taxes?  </p>
<p>Unless the boys have a father figure to show them how to be good men, chances are they will grow up wild and uncontrollable.  A mother can only do so much for boys.  They need male guidance.</p>

		<p>The reason there is so much welfare abuse is the stigma has almost been completely removed from having illegitimate children. For thousands of years it was considered very shameful to have illegitimate children. The word &ldquo;bastard&rdquo; was a terrible insult.<br>
Posted by at 5:23 PM on December 23<br>
================================================================</p>
<p>Let us be clear&hellip; &#8216;bastard&rsquo; being an insult wasnt what kept women from having illegitimate children. The risk of starvation, or living a very poor subsistance level life for herself *and* for her offspring was.</p>
<p>Charles Murray writes intermittently about this. You cannot maintain a stigma and remove all real world consequences for engaging in the tabooed behaviour. </p>
<p>In other words, the only thing that will work,long-run, is a secession of welfare and a return to automatic father custody. *NOT* exhortations for higher morals, or encouraging others to condemn people who engage in tabooed behaviour. <br>

<p>Frankly my friend, the hypocrisy to which you allude is simply not present here, at least not this time.</p>
<p>I myself do not have any children, and I think anyone who would want to have eighteen of them, or ten, must be out of their ever lovin&rsquo; minds. But to each his own, I suppose.</p>
<p>As I understand child tax credits (and please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong here), they are not money given by the government to the parents, but rather money that the parents earned which is simply not being taken from them by the government. This does not cost the government or the taxpayers anything, because nothing is being taken from either group, and neither group has a right to another taxpayer&rsquo;s earnings. Perhaps you are of the foolish notion that all money inherently belongs to the government, and that whatever you keep is through their good graces and at their cost. I for one vehemently disagree, and the only reason they get any cut of my paycheck is because they will come at me with force I cannot repel if I don&rsquo;t pay up (when the mob does this, it&rsquo;s called extortion).</p>
<p>Your claim that the older kids will miss out on adolescence is spotty at best. I only come from a family of two kids, but when I was a teenager I had to take on much responsibility in looking after my baby brother, and also helped a close friend, whose parents were oftentimes absentee, look after his younger siblings. He was only one of four. To say this caused us to miss out on adolescence is definitely a bit of a stretch. And while I know there are kids who do miss out for just that reason, it is hardly a foregone conclusion and a ridiculously large family is hardly necessary.</p>
<p>You state that nothing says the Duggars are not receiving government assistance. But I&rsquo;ve found nothing that says they are, and you&rsquo;ve provided no evidence of it. So far as I can tell, the Duggars are self-sufficient and meeting all of their family&rsquo;s needs with their own efforts. By your own admission, and by hers, Ms. Ryan is not. </p>
<p>You yourself stated she is accepting aid such as food stamps (your defense that she works twenty hours a week to maintain them just shows that she is only willing to do the bare minimum amount of work even to support her own children). In the original article, she herself states that she runs out of food and has to turn to outside help (aka begging) to feed them. If you can&rsquo;t see the difference here, I don&rsquo;t know how to make it any more clear.</p>
<p>Lastly, you go on about the cost of educating the Duggars&rsquo; eighteen kids, and claim that it exceeds anything racked up by all forms of welfare combined. That might be true, if we were only talking about one or two kids, but Ms. Ryan has <i>ten</i> kids being supported by the taxpayer, and all eighteen Duggar kids combined aren&rsquo;t racking up as much as them. Plus the Duggars are themselves paying taxes, which Ms. Ryan is not, or at least not nearly as much as she is taking out. Furthermore, all of the Ryan kids are in public schools as well (or will be, if they&rsquo;re not yet all of age). Put it all together, and the Ryan brood&rsquo;s tab dwarfs the Duggars&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So all in all, there is no double standard being applied by the AmRenners on this thread. The standard is uniform. The difference is that Mr. and Mrs. Duggar are meeting it, Ms. Ryan is not. To judge by your posts, it would seem that your real objection here is that we are holding her to any standard at all.</p>

		<p>Time to step in here: hello, &#8220;Sleep&#8221;. I&rsquo;ve a response for you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither a single-mom with 10 kids nor a two-parent family with 18 is anywhere near ideal.&#8221; I agree, but your argument is classic straw-man. The meaningful question is which would be significantly closer to, or farther from, an &#8220;ideal&#8221;. Along those same lines, you say &#8220;Personally, I don&rsquo;t know which is worse.&#8221;  &mdash;  problem for you but not necessarily for me or any other &#8216;regular&rsquo; here. Personally, I&rsquo;m confident that I do know which is worse.  </p>
<p>&#8220;In either case the older kids are going to miss out on their adolescence because they will be the ones taking care of the younger kids.&#8221; Your concept of &#8216;adolescence&rsquo; as something to be &#8216;missed out on&rsquo; because of caring for younger siblings assumes  some &#8216;values&rsquo; that I&rsquo;m personally not aware of, and don&rsquo;t accept on your mere say-so. You get no pass there; step up and defend what you imply.</p>
<p>Finally, a collection of math problems you posed:</p>
<p>&#8220;A family with 18 kids that sends all of them to public school is going to cost the city&rsquo;s taxpayers $3 million, an amount far above and beyond anything that anyone could ever receive in the various forms of welfare combined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of us yahoos can actually use a calculator, and I ran the numbers: $3 million divided by (18 kids x 18 years of public 1-12 grade school} yields a pretty amazing figure:$9,259 per year, per student! Please inform this forum what the *actual* per-student annual expenditures are in the districts of these two families [they are surely not the same]. Then please explain why we should assume the respective returns on our *unequal* per-child &#8216;investments&rsquo; in these two family units will be anywhere near equal. What are the actuarial odds that the two groups of children will be anywhere near equal, expressed as funds returned, per beneficiary, to education in the US?</p>
<p>Finally, what exactly can Latrica&rsquo;s family expect to receive in per-child non-educational benefits that you say are &#8216;dwarfed&rsquo; by per-pupil expenditures? I&rsquo;d like to know what ratio qualifies as &#8220;dwarfing&#8221;.</p>

<p>You need to wake up and smell reality&hellip;.seriously&hellip;.who is taking care of these children&hellip;having 10 children at age 29 and being single and unable to take care of them is a disgrace to womanhood in this age and time. She can have all the children in the world but she also needs to go in her own pocket to take care of them instead of having other people foot the bill. </p>

		<p>What is wrong with a community holding to high standards?  A civilized society has the right and even obligation to set high standards for all to see, so people have a guide for correct behavior.  If having babies out of wedlock is strongly disapproved of, there will be less of it, even with the welfare perks.  If having illegitimate children is accepted as an alternative or even heroic lifestyle, there will be more of it.  Did you know there once was a time in America when people were embarrassed to be on welfare, and tried to get off it as soon as possible?  </p>
<p>We are social creatures who deep down want to be loved.  Approval by society is a weak form of love, but we&rsquo;ll take it.  If Latrica felt disapproval from the community because of her promiscuous, husbandless, welfare collecting motherhood, she might reconsider having babies every year with men who disappear.    </p>
<p>Exerting social pressure works to control bad behavior, not 100%, but it does work.  It is also much cheaper than paying for welfare, reform schools, prisons, the court system, police officers, prison guards, and the whole multi-billion dollar system we have set up to treat the consequences of late intercession.</p>

		<p>FYI&hellip;..The Duggars homeschool.  I am sure they pay taxes to their school district, but do not use it.  And if its in the form of property tax, they own a very large, and I am sure valuable home.  So the community comes out on the winning end, in a big way.</p>

		<p>Fair and well, I should have checked better into the stories about the Duggar family.  Nevertheless my point is that people shouldn&rsquo;t be judged based on how much government money they spend, since it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s right to make use of the services our government provides.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that a single mother should be made to work at all when she has that many children at home.  As a conservative, I believe that children should be more important than earning money in the workforce, and if that means paying single mothers to stay home, we should do it.  I&rsquo;ve come to judge from experience that the children of a low-income mother-led household are usually better off if their mother is home whenever they are.  Besides, surely if the Duggar family is homeschooling, the mother is not working?  I am not faulting her for that, but I think it would be hypocritical to criticize one mother for working 20 hours a week and forgive the other for working zero.  </p>

<p>Well, for me, it&rsquo;s simple. The Duggars are white and I&rsquo;m white and I want to see white people survive. I belive in working for one&rsquo;s self-interest and that includes having my genotype survive.</p>
<p>Latrica is not white. She&rsquo;s not one of my people. She is not of the same genotype.</p>

		<p>most people here are being hypocritical for holding her family and the Duggars to different standards</p>
<p>No, we are, instead holding them all to the same standard, and the Duggars pass with flying colors. They are self-sufficient, accepting no handouts from social programs, and raising respectful, law-abiding, potentially good, producing citizens. It is true that Mrs. Duggar is also a stay-at-home mother, she also home-schools her children. She is also married to the father of her children  &mdash;  the same father of ALL of them.<br>
Miss Ryan on the other hand works only a token job, relies on handouts to feed, clothe and house her children each month when the welfare money runs out, and whines about how hard it is to take them anywhere. She has never been married and her children certainly DON&rsquo;T all have the same father. What a sterling example to her litter of potential thieves, rapists, convicts and hookers. She fails the grade totally and completely.<br>
Same standard, different results  &mdash;  wonder what made the difference? </p>

		<p>The average per-pupil spending for public schools in Flint, Michigan is $10916 per year: <a href="http://www.greatschools.net/cgi-bin/mi/district_profile/378/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatschools.net/cgi-bin/mi/district_profile/378/</a>  </p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t my intention to put these two families on a money scale and see which one was heavier.  I&rsquo;m sure the Duggar children will produce more income in the long run, in any case.  </p>
<p>The bottom line is that I don&rsquo;t think raising 18 children in one household is any better for the children than raising 10 of them without a father.  It&rsquo;s not about the money.  Perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong and the Ryan family will all grow up to be disappointments.  Even if that happens, I can&rsquo;t personally place any blame on them, or on Latrica, as I&rsquo;m sure she is doing her best to prevent such an outcome.</p>

		<p>Sleep says that she blames neither the children nor Latrica.  I&rsquo;m with you as far as the children being blameless.  Where I disagree is that I do blame Latrica for the situation she and her children are in.  There is no way to say this kindly, so I must be blunt.  Had Latrica been a little more selective of whom she chose to open her legs for then maybe she wouldn&rsquo;t be in a situation where she is raising 10 kids on her own.  Seriously, this woman is batting a thousand when it comes to picking her mates.<br>
Sofita says you can&rsquo;t squeeze blood from a turnip.  This is true.  Therefore, it should be made mandatory that sperm donors be identified before any taxpayer-funded public assistance is given, then the bill should be sent to these deadbeats.  If they fail to make payments then they should be punished just as someone that fails to pay their court-ordered child support is punished.  Letting these guys off the hook while sending the bill to taxpayers is only encouraging further behavior such as this.</p>

<p>Who you gonna blame?white people and the rest of society. I am sure you believe that it takes a village (the government plantation) to raise a child hmm. This woman is perpetuating the stereotype of black women being one dimensional sexual types and you defend her irresponsible behavior. I said this many times before&hellip;.the deplorable conditions in the black community can be traced right back to the women who abdicate their personal responsibility and this story is a prime example.

<p>If Latrica and her ex-boyfriends really are entitled to be this irresponsible, they should all receive court-ordered sterilizations.

<p>Are you serious? This is the same non-sense that feminist who hate the patriarchy advocate&hellip;excluding single mothers from becoming productive members of society&hellip;..the government needs to take care of them from the cradle to the grave at the expense of others. You got to be kidding. I am a mother who ended up single and raising my child on my own but I had to put up a fierce fight against this hogwash&hellip;..of single mothers should stay home to maintain my dignity. You don&rsquo;t realize that what you are advocating is simply socialism and another form of slavery based on gender. The US Constitution says that all man are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. It is my right to be in the workforce and make a living regardless if I am a single mother&hellip;&hellip;my well-being is my responsibility and not that of the government. My child was important to me and I set the example for her to be a self-reliant and productive member of society instead of a burden that constantly needs hand-outs. </p>
<p>I wonder where America and the rest of the world would be if all the mothers who entered the workforce during World War II while their husbands went to battle had stayed home and demanded that the government had to take care of them. You need to check yourself&hellip;.seriously! <br>

		<p>Perhaps instead of agonizing over how she&rsquo;s going to take 10 kids out to a movie, perhaps Latrica could buy movies out of the bargain bin at Wal Mart, or used from thrift stores.  The whole hassle of transporting ten children disappears - as if by magic! -  when one watches movies at home on DVD or VHS.</p>
<p>I usually order them from Amazon dot com, but I suspect this is not an option for an unwed mother of ten who doubtless has never had a credit card.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s little wonder why the vast majority of black women never end up marrying. Too many of them start their families before they are even out of their teens, and wind up married to the Government. The men who father their children are seen as little more than sperm donors, and are quaintly called &#8220;baby daddies&#8221;. It is not at all uncommon for black women to have numerous children when they are still in their 20&rsquo;s, and for many of those children to be fathered by different men. What man in his right mind is going to want to marry a woman in that situation? Much less consider raising the offspring of countless men? Until black women change their ways, most of them will remain single.</p>

And since the eldest of Miss Ryan&rsquo;s kids is only 13, and the youngest only 2 months, it&rsquo;s a little early to be praising them for being law abiding citizens. To even compare the 2 families is ridiculous.<br>

		<p>Sleep, unfortunately you have it exactly backwards. We don&rsquo;t owe this woman anything as a society. She &#8221; made her own bed &#8220;. When this trend of not being responsible for your own actions, and political correctness, that has been escalating over the past several decades ceases, then we may be able to build the great nation that this country once was. </p>

		<p>Sleep, it&rsquo;s wrong to have even one child out of wedlock, regardless of race. It is the height of irresponsibility and immorality to continue to produce them if you are poor and unmarried. I am certainly disgusted that my distant cousin, now 21, gave birth out of wedlock when she was a month shy of 18. She has no intention of marrying her child&rsquo;s dad. I privately question how my first cousin and her husband (parents of Ms. Unwed Mom) could have allowed her to get in such a situation. I would never expect anyone of any race to condone my young cousin&rsquo;s behavior, and incidentally, I am also disgusted at the family with 18 children. Sure, the parents had their offspring after marriage (I assume they were all born within the bounds of matrimony), and the parents may indeed be strong and caring, but I am absolutely opposed to anyone producing so many children. It is irresponsible and unnecessary. How can anyone handle so many? When do the parents find time to nurture their relationship?</p>

		<p>JTP, there is nothing wrong with being childless by choice. Such folks are not inherently realistic; they may be able to devote themselves to doing things for society that couples w/children would have a hard time doing.</p>

		<p>Jordan NYC, abortion just encourages immorality. Why practice self-control and morality if you can terminate an unwanted pregnancy, especially at governmental expense? <br>
Fred, it is not stupid for whites to avoid having children. Not everyone likes them. &#8220;Stupid&#8221; is having them when you don&rsquo;t like them. Also, some whites may marry too late to have them. My sister is 45 and married for the first time 5 yrs. ago. Her husband is nearly 50. It would be too much of a risk for her to have a child.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sound pessimistic but we reached the tipping point in the last decade and we are now at the point of no return.  There are millions like Latrica (and Juanita and Ling- Ling too) getting their &#8220;freak on&#8221;, suckling the taxpayers teet and birthing the next generation of America&rsquo;s criminal class.  The only way America can survive is to sacrifice our long cherished belief in freedom and democracy and replace it fascism. Fascism that dictates who can breed and who can&rsquo;t and sponsors eugenics and mandatory sterilizations. Sadly, America doesn&rsquo;t have the stomach for it.  </p>

<p>Sorry, Cindy, you&rsquo;re part of the old 1950&rsquo;s anti-life way of thinking about things. </p>
<p>In fact, any white birth, no matter if the woman is married of not is desirable, and being childless by choice is nuts if you understand nature at all.  You are substituting your man made morality disguised as religious teachings for what nature teaches us.</p>
<p>We need a spiritual rebirth of our people and we have to rid ourselves of false religious teachings that will lead to our extinction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take nature&rsquo;s laws and morality over man made laws and morality any day of the weak.</p>

		<p>To Sleep, you are a closet liberal, aren&rsquo;t you?  I don&rsquo;t have sympathy for those who have kids out of wedlock, then ask the taxpayers to foot the bill.</p>
<p>Tim, as for the Asian girls having kids out of wedlock, that&rsquo;s less likely.  Blacks, Hispanic, and Amerindian girls and women are having the most out of wedlock kids.  That&rsquo;s a travesty to this former great nation of ours.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ll assume &ldquo;law-abiding&rdquo; though, as it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that the oldest, a 13 year old, would be a criminal much less so with the others&hellip;</p>
<p>While I see no reason to believe this particular brood contains any criminals and do not wish to infer as much, don&rsquo;t let mere age fool you.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I was a Juvenile Probation Officer there were many, many 10 to 14 year old feral blacks who committed robbery and assaults, usually on elderly whites.  These ferals would gather in herds of 20 or more after school and swarm aboard city buses where they would snatch purses and hit whites.  Smaller packs of 4 or 5 would leave the school to which they were bussed from their project liars and roam the business streets knocking down elderly white women as they snatched their purses.  They would also swarm into stores stealing everything they could get their hands on.</p>
<p>I remember one 12 year old who aspired to be a pimp.  He was arrested after boarding a city bus, accosting a high school girl with the words, &#8220;you gonna be muh b**ch now mother****er&#8221;, hitting her and attempting to drag her off the bus.</p>
<p>Speaking of city buses, there was a major problem with 10 to 14 year old black ferals bringing newspapers aboard city buses and setting the papers on fire.  The mostly black bus drivers took to bringing fire extinguishers along on their shifts.</p>
<p>One of the many problems of school busing is that ferals are bussed into civilized white neighborhoods.  They arrive at school and spend the day roaming in packs stealing and getting to trouble.  Since most of the people at home during the day in white neighborhoods are retirees, these elderly white retirees are the prey of the feral black youth. Many of these elderly whites are knocked down and end up with fractured or broken knees, hips and spines because of the 10 to 14 year old blacks.</p>
<p>The most dangerous ferals are the middle school ones.</p>
<p>The article does not say anything about the children either positive or negative.  But the children of black welfare mothers are the ones who form the bulk of the young criminals on Probation to Juvenile Court and inmates of Juvenile halls and reform schools.<br>
