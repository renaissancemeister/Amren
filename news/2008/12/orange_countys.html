			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>My-Thuan Tran, Los Angeles Times, December 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Westminster became the first city in America with a Vietnamese-majority city council after a final tabulation of votes Monday shifted the winners in two Orange County cities.</p>
<p>Two Vietnamese American candidates who had been trailing after initial vote counts on election day emerged as winners when the Orange County registrar certified the final results of the Nov. 4 election.</p>
<p>In Westminster, Truong Diep initially trailed Penny Loomer by 1,500 votes. But the final vote count put Diep, 25, a member of the Midway City Sanitary District board, ahead by a few dozen votes, giving him the second-place win.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Diep&rsquo;s election stands as a milestone for the small, conservative city that has been transformed by Vietnamese refugees into the thriving enclave of Little Saigon.</p>
<p>The election once again shows the Vietnamese community&rsquo;s propensity for voting absentee. Diep said his win was a surprise, that he had not known if the absentee ballots sent in by Vietnamese voters could overcome the 1,500-vote margin he was behind by.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In neighboring Garden Grove, after thousands of absentee and provisional ballots were counted, Andrew Do secured a second-place finish for a seat on the City Council, edging out Robin Peace Marcario.</p>

		<p>The Vietnamese in southern California are somewhat like Cubans in south Florida   &mdash;   a non-white group that egalitarian Republicans boast about, for their fleeing communism and their voting the more anti-Communist party (Republicans) in the first maybe two generations.  But give them time, they&rsquo;ll be as left wing as anyone else.</p>
<p>Besides, I don&rsquo;t want to engage in political partisan rationales for America to become more non-white.  It&rsquo;s supposed to be ours.</p>

		<p>This shows the power of racial groups congregating in the same location and engaging in bloc voting.  Whites should do more of this.</p>

		<p>I live near Westminster (sister city to Westminster, UK) and can attest it is no longer an American city. Tet, the Vietnamese New Year, is now a major holiday, complete with a three day fair. Foreigners (i.e., whites) are sometimes made to feel unwelcome by glances or occasionally words, though not so aggresively as is the case with Mexicans. We are still safe there. The only good point is they are Asians, hence Westminster is economically thriving.</p>

		<p>so, a majority Vietnamese council is another positive milestone? I guess importance of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; only applies to white folks.</p>

		<p>Vietnamese is a nationality, not a race. So Americans were elected to American political positions. Nothing else.</p>

		<p>Have you been there?  Westminster is an undesirable city filled mostly with people who can&rsquo;t afford to live in a nicer area.  Orange County used to be the best place when it predominately White. It has literally been invaded by Asians who are ruining even the nicest areas.  </p>

		<p>From my experience with Vietnamese, it won&rsquo;t be long until Westminster and Garden Grove will have their treasuries plundered and some of their officials indicted for embezzlement.  </p>

		<p>   Honest to God, it seems like only yesterday that I was a young marine in Vietnam and was shooting at them. Ever notice how our enemies always end up living next door to us? Better be careful whom you fire at in Afghanistan and Iraq, there is a very good chance they will be your neighbor way too soon. Or possibly even your boss.</p>

<p>I thought Orange County was already broke, having been raped some years ago by the previous white council members.</p>

<p>hahahahahahaa I too, see the irony in this having spent 3 1/2 years there but, not really all that different FROM there if I recall, shooting and killing each other in the day and in bed with them at night.</p>

<p>The grandchildren of those who fled in the 1970&rsquo;s are already liberal.  It is difficult to escape the liberal brainwashing during 12 years of public school and college.</p>
