<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28161210/">Sex Slavery: Living the American Nightmare</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex Johnson and Cesar Rodriguez, MSNBC, December 22, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The reality is that human trafficking goes on in nearly every American city and town, said Lisette Arsuaga, director of development for the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, a human rights organization in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Human trafficking is well hidden,&#8221; Arsuaga said. &#8220;I consider it a huge problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her assessment is shared by authorities in Bexar County, Texas, where the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office has formed a task force with Shared Hope International, an anti-slavery organization founded by former Rep. Linda Smith, D-Wash. Bexar County is considered a crossroads of the cross-border Mexican sex slave trade because two Interstate highways that crisscross the state intersect there, some 150 miles from the Mexican border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A $9.5 billion-a-year industry</b></p>
<p>Federal officials agree that the trafficking of human beings as sex slaves is far more prevalent than is popularly understood. While saying it is difficult to pinpoint the scope of the industry, given its shadowy nature, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials estimated that it likely generates more than $9.5 billion a year.</p>
<p>Last year alone, the FBI opened more than 225 human trafficking investigations in the United States. Figures for 2008 are not yet available, but in a coordinated nationwide sweep in July, federal, state and local authorities made more than 640 arrests and rescued 47 children in just three days.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most cases involve &#8220;international persons trafficked to the United States from other countries,&#8221; who are generally less aware of their rights, probably do not speak English and are frightened to go to the authorities, he said. &#8220;Victims are often lured with false promises of good jobs and better lives and are then forced to work in the sex industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>While an increasing number of young men and boys are being forced into the commercial sex industry, more than 80 percent of victims are women and girls, the State Department estimated this year. Of those, 70 percent are forced into prostitution, stripping, pornography or mail-order marriage.</p>
<p>That allegedly was the case with the L.A. Madam [Maribel Rodriguez Vasquez] ring.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said in court documents that the Vasquez sold Guatemalan women and girls to one another like slaves for several years. Ring members also would try to keep them in line by taking them to witch doctors who threatened to put curses on them and their families if they ran away, the prosecution said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;These young women were enticed into coming to this country by promises of the American dream, only to arrive and discover that what awaited was a nightmare,&#8221; said Robert Schoch, an ICE special agent.</p>
<p><b>A modern-day form of slavery</b></p>
<p>Less publicized cases reveal ordeals just as horrific.</p>
<p>In August, three owners and operators of Asian massage parlors in Johnson County, Kansas, near Kansas City, pleaded guilty to human trafficking of women they recruited from China and forced into prostitution.</p>
<p>Charging documents said the defendants, all Chinese nationals, arranged the women&rsquo;s travel, meeting them at the Kansas City, Mo., airport and driving them directly to one of two massage parlors they operated in Overland Park. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last month, police in Nashville, Tenn., arrested two men and charged them with holding a young Mexican woman as a sex slave, driving her across Tennessee, Georgia and Florida, where she was forced to engage in prostitution with as many as seven men a day, court records said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Beatings, rapes and forced abortions</b></p>
<p>In New York, meanwhile, Consuelo Carreto Valencia, a 4-foot-10, 61-year-old grandmother, pleaded guilty in July to smuggling dozens of women from Mexico and violently coercing them to perform sex acts.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that Valencia was the matriarch of an extensive prostitution ring based in Mexico. The victims were compelled to perform sex acts 12 hours a day and were subjected to beatings, rape and forced abortions, they said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Cases hard to build</b></p>
<p>But law enforcement officials say that such successes are relatively rare. Often, victims are too frightened to cooperate with investigators, and when they are willing to help, they often speak little or no English, making it problematic to present cases that commonly rest on one person&rsquo;s word against that of another.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Catching ringleaders in the act is particularly difficult, said Minneapolis Deputy Police Chief Valerie Wurster.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t find people who are chained to beds,&#8221; Wurster said. &#8220;What we&rsquo;re finding is people who are very frightened, who don&rsquo;t have resources locally, being managed by someone who is telling them things that aren&rsquo;t very true about the environment that they&rsquo;re living in.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This article mentions immigration and the illicit sex trade.  However, it is a problem domestically.  The biggest source are black gangs from big cities kidnapping white girls of Scandinavian heritage from the upper Midwest and trucking them into big cities, forcing them into such &#8220;service.&#8221;  I had a Federal Bureau of Prisons officer tell me as much in their process of bringing such a Federal inmate for medical services.</p>

		<p>  Once again, isn&rsquo;t diversity a grand thing? Imagine, before the 1965 immigration laws were passed, and the 1964 civil rights laws; this country had no problems such as these. And the icing on the cake is another unqualified Kennedy wants to throw her criminal activities into the ring. Just what we need! But I never see anything posted on AmRen about the source of all the corruption and destruction in our country. There is a group whom has the money and the clout to make both parties skip rope. And yet,with all the wisdom of the great minds posting at AmRen, not one regular will approach this forbidden territory. Until we come clean with ourselves, we will continue to lose ground. Choose your allies wisely. </p>

		<p>Immigration must be ended, and our borders guarded, and all illegals deported.</p>
<p>Most of the clients of these brothels are illegals, but the crime problem is a symptom of our perverse race blind open border policy.<br>

		<p>Rest assured, A.O. that I at the least, and I would imagine most everybody here as well, do not harbor resentment for the victims.  I do harbor a great deal of resentment for those who have paved the way for these heinous criminals and their parasitical activities, and who obstruct only the activities of good and decent citizens who wish only to reclaim their society and nation.  </p>
<p>There will be no end to such horrors as long as these parasites are allowed to swamp our society.   It can only get worse, unless we get the country back to a 90 or 95 percent white population.  </p>
<p>We need both a racially sane immigration policy and promotion of large, white families in small towns.  </p>

		<p>For all the Liberal whining about how bigoted and backward White society is, White men certainly seem to treat their white women a lot better than &#8220;minorities&#8221; treat their women. Of course, factual reality is rarely on the Left&rsquo;s side but you&rsquo;d think that radical liberal women, &#8220;feminists&#8221; and such, would be more keen on minority misogyny and thus work to counter the third world invasion of our land. Maybe after one of them is beaten, raped and/or degraded by a Muslim or Mexican for whom &#8220;civility&#8221; isn&rsquo;t a word they&rsquo;ll wake up and give race-realists like us a second thought.</p>

		<p>For those that want to read more such storis, I suggest you go to ICE&rsquo;s website. This is the type of stuff that the main stream media normally doesn&rsquo;t write about. It might tarnish the image of illegals as nothing more than honest hard workers, that just want a better life.</p>
<p>Bush was right for once, these are jobs that most Americans won&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a matter of holding anything against the victims, the point is they are in this country illegally and need to be deported. If they are kept here out of some missguided since of pity, that would be a big mistake. If they stay here, they will become a burden on society. If they say here, they will be preyed upon time and time again.</p>
<p>They need to go home to thier families where they belong. I know if I had a child that had been kidnapped, I&rsquo;d want them back<br>

		<p>RE: M.C. Scott and others&rsquo; observation on MSM reporting on the matter of immigrant related sex trade.</p>
<p>In this Raleigh N&O; article about a twin execution style slaying and robbery at a Mexican brothel, the reporter depicts one of the &#8220;victims&#8221; in almost cherubic terms as if we had lost a pillar of society!!  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Also killed that day was Marco Antonio Alvarez-Martinez, 19, who was at the home to visit his girlfriend who was employed there. Alvarez-Martinez lived near the Hillsborough area with his family and attended high school in the area as well as church. His family said he stayed away from drugs and alcohol and spent his spare time teaching recent immigrants how to speak English.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get that culture.  He attends church, stays away from drugs and alcohol but it&rsquo;s ok for his girlfriend to work in a brothel and he visits her there. How can a real man stand the thought of the woman he supposedly loves working as a prostitute?<br>
I don&rsquo;t understand how they rationalize church going, statues of La Virgen de Guadalupe, wearing the Rosario around their necks and turning out their women to be used as though they were public toilets. <br>
In the name of GOD, what have we let happen to our country? </p>
