<h1><a href="/ar/2006/08/index.html">Dispatches from the Go-Slow Zone</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Ingram, American Renaissance, August 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s a safe bet that for many whites, exposure to blacks and Hispanics comes in controlled doses. Their positive attitudes toward &#8220;diversity&#8221; are shaped by isolated experiences with small handfuls of non-whites, often in majority-white settings. Until some years ago, my own life followed this pattern. I was a &#8220;colorblind conservative&#8221; and liked Newt Gingrich and Jack Kemp. Although I was beginning to lose my illusions, I thought all we needed to fix the race problem were free markets and &#8220;better values.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was about to change. After law school, I accepted a job with the civil division of a major metropolitan area&rsquo;s legal office, which defends the city against lawsuits. If you were hit by a police car, for example, and decided to sue, we handled the case. Incoming lawyers were assigned to various locations around the city, and I landed in the least-white part of town &mdash; 29 percent and falling.</p>
<p>There were mutterings about past lawyers who had refused this assignment for &#8220;safety&#8221; reasons, but I thought of it as a gritty, world-expanding adventure. Like a British explorer, I would venture out where others feared. How bad could it be?</p>
<p>The subway ride to the office was one clue. As the train rolled away from the center of the city each morning, I was often the sole remaining white on an otherwise packed car. On more than one occasion, I sat frozen in my seat while a nearby black yelled things like &#8220;I&rsquo;m-a kill-a white motha******!&#8221; The outbursts were probably aimed at me, but sometimes I wasn&rsquo;t sure. Blacks who did not appear to have noticed me would sometimes mutter about killing white people.</p>
<p>One time in the subway, I watched as a full-grown black man wearing little more than a diaper and Nike flip-flops lit a crack pipe, introducing me to the sweetish smell of crack cocaine. The smoke was intense and acrid, and I was not alone in thinking him obviously unhinged and probably dangerous. Even the blacks went scurrying. &#8220;Dat fool be smokin&rsquo; crack, y&rsquo;all!&#8221; someone yelled.</p>
<p>Another time, at about 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, I watched a Hispanic woman slap her children as she sipped from an aluminum can in a brown paper bag. I was close enough to smell beer, and narrowed my eyes in disapproval. &#8220;Who da f*** are you, da police?&#8221; she shouted. I&rsquo;m not sure it would have made any difference if I had been.</p>
<p>The walk from the station to the office could be just as harrowing. Chicken bones, the occasional used condom, and even used diapers littered the sidewalks. Sheltered areas stank of urine. Rap music blared from cars stopped at intersections. The rap was sometimes out-blasted by salsa and merengue music from Hispanics, who drove cars with impossibly large sound systems better suited to concert halls. To escape the din and reclaim a corner of civilization, I listened to Bach on my Walkman.</p>
<p>One would think a law office could seal out much of this, but it crept in, like jungle vines enveloping an abandoned building. The &#8220;support staff,&#8221; as they were called, were overwhelmingly black and Hispanic. Outside my office sat a black Haitian woman who spoke almost no English and would communicate in incomprehensible baby-like cries and moans. She was ostensibly in charge of office supplies, but rarely attended to her job. If you asked about the possibility of new pens, for example, she would say, &#8220;Nooooo. You no do dat. I yeah, see. Uh uh. Do dee.&#8221; I began buying my own supplies.</p>
<p>The noise was insufferable. Desktop radios in the office would blare syrupy R&B.; The sound of sirens and car alarms outside never seemed to stop. Staffers would yell and chase each other like kindergartners on the playground. It was mostly in fun, but it was constant and loud and something I cannot imagine white people doing in an office.</p>
<p>Drinking was a favorite office activity. One support staffer, a black African I&rsquo;ll call &#8220;Zeus,&#8221; drenched himself with cologne but could not hide the reek of alcohol. This fellow was legendary for avoiding work and acting bizarrely. Zeus wandered into my office one day with his shirt unbuttoned almost to his waist and smelling particularly vodka-soaked. The conversation began civilly, but as it wore on he became upset that I was, for some undetermined reason, not &#8220;respecting&#8221; him. He grew agitated and though he was small, I thought he might attack me.</p>
<p>Zeus, who was from someplace in Africa &mdash; I can&rsquo;t remember which country, exactly &mdash; sometimes made clicking noises when he talked, reminding me of Africans in National Geographic documentaries who speak with mouth-clicks. He had been warned about &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; behavior toward women &mdash; though I never heard the specifics &mdash; and I believe one woman lawyer had asked that Zeus never be allowed in her office.</p>
<p>At the front desk sat a young Hispanic man who dressed in sleeveless T-shirts, sweatpants, and immaculate white athletic shoes. He loudly boasted, as I stood nearby, of &#8220;beating those freakin&rsquo; white boys&#8221; at handball. I wondered what would happen if a white staffer boasted of &#8220;beating those freakin&rsquo; brown boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once, as I stood at the copy machine, he approached me from behind and said, &#8220;Yo yo, hurry up.&#8221; When I turned to look at him he continued, &#8220;Yeah, you heard me. Dat&rsquo;s how it is, yo.&#8221; Yes, Hispanics say &#8220;yo.&#8221; This is common in the crossover world of big-city non-whites, though not all Hispanics talked like blacks &mdash; only the ones who were trying to be &#8220;gangsta.&#8221; This man was probably expressing a kind of pan-minority solidarity: &#8220;Yo, I&rsquo;m brown and I&rsquo;m down. I know what blacks have to deal with, and I know who the enemy is.&#8221; It would not have been a good idea to try to teach him better manners.</p>
<p>People who were, themselves, rude could demand punctilious manners in others. Once, an older black woman punched me in the back after I brushed past her. I&rsquo;m normally the type who says &#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; but her reaction came before I could say a word. She obviously saw me as a snobby white man who must be shown his place: &#8220;Cain&rsquo;t you say &lsquo;scuse me?&#8221;</p>
<p>One female Hispanic staffer, whom I understood to be Puerto Rican, almost never did any work. &#8220;Petunia&#8221; was unbearably loud, and would chatter in Spanish all day with other staffers. &#8220;Mira! Mira!&#8221; (Look!, or Hey!) was her constant cry, and she had alcohol on her breath. There were rumors of daytime hard drug use, and I could believe them.</p>
<p>Dress in the office was aggressively casual. Memos would occasionally go out telling the staff not to wear &#8220;do-rags,&#8221; but after a short period of reform, they&rsquo;d be back, along with &#8220;African pride&#8221; T-shirts. One staffer assigned to the front desk wore Nation of Islam or black nationalist-style get-ups, including combat boots and the distinctive short-brimmed cap. One Hispanic regularly wore tank-top shirts.</p>
<p>As is common in many offices, staffers often called in sick, but this was particularly frequent for blacks and Hispanics. They also cut days short, despite efforts to make sure they didn&rsquo;t. At the front door there was an electronic palm reader. This sophisticated device could distinguish handprints, and employees had to &#8220;hand in&#8221; when they came to work and &#8220;hand out&#8221; when they left. The reader recorded arrival and departure times, just like a punch clock, but with an important difference: It could not be fooled by having someone else punch in for an absent worker.</p>
<p>Employees got around this by skipping out the back door; they could &#8220;hand-in&#8221; and &#8220;hand-out&#8221; at the usual times, but be gone for part of the day. The back door had an alarm that was supposed to discourage this illicit coming and going, but the staff kept a rolled-up newspaper wedged in the jam to keep the door from closing all the way. Anyone using this door was supposed to &#8220;honor&#8221; the system by carefully replacing the door-holder. I did not want to face the considerable wrath of black and Hispanic staff, so I complied.</p>
<p>Other memos from the head of our office were about workplace cleanliness. Staffers liked to bring in breakfast and eat at their desks. This way, as far as the hand-print reader was concerned, breakfast counted as work time. Eating was also protection against work; staffers would ignore you or refuse a request if you approached them during a feeding, no matter how odd a time of day it was. However, after a huge styrofoam-plate meal there would be crumbs everywhere. This encouraged the mice, which were often spotted running about, and occasionally showed up dead under desks. In the morning, I sometimes found mouse droppings on my desk. They looked like bran cereal.</p>
<p>Office files were always in terrible shape. Open one, and out would spill crumpled fax cover sheets, but little else. I could tell the handwriting of one black male staffer because it looked like a child&rsquo;s. I sometimes found vacation brochures or food wrappers in the files. The file room itself was a shambles, with files misplaced, mis-alphabetized or, more often than not, missing.</p>
<p>Staffers sometimes slept at their desks. They would just put their heads down and take a long, unapologetic snooze. One woman always put an open Bible under her head; maybe she thought she could claim she was deep in prayer.</p>
<p>The bathrooms did not have soap or hot water. To get water, you&rsquo;d press a button on the sink top that would release a three-second burst of cold water that was never enough. You had to keep hitting the button to get your hands clean. Presumably, like the hand-print reader, this was a precautionary measure; the water might never be turned off if it came out of ordinary taps. Paper towels were only intermittently available. Some people brought soap and towels to the office, in little plastic containers, and would gather them up before heading to the bathroom. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what caused the soap and towel shortage &mdash; whether the custodians were slacking off or whether the staff would take supplies home if they were plentiful.</p>
<p>Some of the lawyers were white but the attorney-in-charge was a black woman who, it was clear to me, held her position for racial reasons. It was said that she would fall asleep during settlement conferences with judges. She praised black lawyers lavishly, but sometimes could not remember the names of white lawyers &mdash; mine, for example. On the side, she was associated with a civil rights group that frequently sued the city, often claiming racism and discrimination. Despite an accent that sounded Caribbean, she took pains to remind us that she was &#8220;a black woman in America,&#8221; whatever that was supposed to mean.</p>
<p>One male lawyer, whom I understood to be a Dominican black/Hispanic mix, wore a Bob Marley-style head of braids that fell to his waist. He kept novels about &#8220;black power&#8221; on his desk and liked to talk about firearms. His fingernails were coated with clear polish on top and dirty underneath. I thought it was an odd combination.</p>
<p>As part of my job I often had to deal with other city agencies, usually by telephone. The contact person for one of these agencies, whom I&rsquo;ll call &#8220;Opal,&#8221; was useless. She sounded inebriated on the phone, but that could have been her heavy &mdash; probably Jamaican &mdash; accent. Or maybe it was a combination of the two. In any event, I could not understand her. &#8220;Dizza-opa,&#8221; she would answer, which I eventually came to understand was how she said, &#8220;This is Opal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opal&rsquo;s dedication to avoiding any requests I might have for her was remarkable. Like so many black employees, she was on high alert for anything that could remotely be construed as beyond her duties. &#8220;Dat ain&rsquo;t my job&#8221; was her refrain.</p>
<p>I could not help noticing, though, that when I overheard a black call her up the going was easier. &#8220;Hey, girl,&#8221; was how it started, followed by &#8220;Alright now, alright now,&#8221; knowing laughter, and probably a fulfilled request.</p>
<p>The slightest difficulty or obstacle was enough for black staffers to simply stop working on an assignment. For example, if they could not find a street name in a computer database, it would never occur to them to try a different spelling even if the one they were looking up was clearly a misspelling. If a contact at another agency did not return a phone call, they considered their duty done. A follow-up call would be too much to expect. This meant that a task you thought was underway would languish, and when you finally traced back to the source of the stoppage, they would shamelessly describe some trivial reason as if it were complete justification. It never seemed to occur to them that solving problems sometimes requires trying various approaches.</p>
<p>This, however, was assuming you could get them to agree to do something in the first place. Sometimes they would turn down a request point-blank, even when it was clearly part of their job. &#8220;Yo, man, look at dis,&#8221; Zeus would say, pointing to piles of files on his desk, when I asked him to do something. &#8220;Now what you want from me, man?&#8221; Zeus had a single decoration in his cubicle: an emaciated African child bent over in the dirt next to a vulture. The caption read: &#8220;I am a human being.&#8221; Zeus&rsquo; large head on his small body somewhat resembled the child&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Black women, meanwhile, were ready to bounce me before I even opened my mouth. I&rsquo;d walk to their stations and wait politely while they chatted on the phone: &#8220;Girl, you didn&rsquo;t!&#8221; When they noticed me trying to get their attention, they&rsquo;d ice over and glower: &#8220;Wha-choo-wan?&#8221; Or &#8220;You gots some kinda problem?&#8221;</p>
<p>These people know they had little reason to worry about any complaint I might make to higher-ups. They knew their jobs were safe. Besides, it seemed to me that a frustrated white person simply delighted them. You were in their territory, and they knew it. For most of the blacks, work of any kind was an imposition to which they submitted as seldom as possible. They never took the slightest interest in it, and had no concept of taking pride in what they did. Their lack of concern for what might happen out in the &#8220;white man&rsquo;s world&#8221; was breathtaking. They did just enough to stay out of trouble; an approaching white man was a bother and nothing more.</p>
<p>Telephone conversations with blacks and Hispanics could be surreal. I once called the schools division, an agency from which one would expect clear speech, proper grammar, and some understanding of purpose. A black-sounding woman answered after many rings. When I made a request, she replied with a telephone number. I had had bad experiences with being fobbed off this way, and asked what the number was for. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t gots no idea,&#8221; she said. I inquired further. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know nuthin&rsquo;,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Can you find someone who does?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Hol&rsquo; on,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>I waited on hold for 10 minutes, after which a woman with a Hispanic accent came on the line and gave me the same number. I said something about having the impression that her office was an &#8220;auxiliary office,&#8221; but she did not know what that meant. She then went on to say she did not know the function of the office where she was answering the phone: &#8220;Nobody evah told us that, suh.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least that call was answered. Often, listed numbers went nowhere: they rang and rang, clicked off after a number of rings, or went to a voicemail labyrinth from which there was no escape. You knew that if a recorded black female voice told you to &#8220;have a blessed day&#8221; the call would never be returned.</p>
<p>If blacks were often hard to understand, Hispanics sometimes did not speak English at all. I met one who worked full-time as the driver for some agency official. I wondered how he could be a reliable driver if he couldn&rsquo;t read street signs, to say nothing of why a minor official like his boss deserved a chauffeur. One Hispanic did speak some English, but with an astoundingly thick and unintelligible accent. He was a school principal. News stories about the city&rsquo;s miserable schools invariably blamed &#8220;white racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a place like my office, one might have expected the whites to be drawn to each other like explorers meeting by chance in the jungle, but there were hardly enough whites even to begin to establish a sense of community. There was a Persian lawyer, an Indian, a Chinese, and a Lebanese. They were all dedicated to the job and were probably just as dismayed by what they saw as I was, but never made a racial remark. Other whites seemed to have a strong ethnic identification &mdash; Italian or Jewish, for example &mdash; that gave them some kind of identity, comfort or protection. Other whites seemed to crave &#8220;street cred:&#8221; One white woman prominently displayed a photo of herself with what looked like a black prom date; another was married to a Hispanic.</p>
<p>As for ordinary, non-ethnic whites like me, there were maybe two others in the whole office. None of us ever spoke about the situation we faced. It would have been too risky. Whites who worked elsewhere would say things like &#8220;It&rsquo;s crazy there,&#8221; but would never mention race. It was much easier to communicate with the whites, and they could usually be counted on to do their jobs, but I never saw the slightest hint of commiseration, much less solidarity.</p>
<p>The blacks, of course, were &#8220;bruthah&#8221; and &#8220;sistah&#8221; to each other, but the office was a miscegenist mix that ran the gamut of skin colors, with many racially ambiguous staffers. I never detected racial tension between blacks and Hspanics; if anything there was brown-black solidarity against whites.</p>
<p>I lasted a year. This was a hell I&rsquo;d never bargained for. For a man just out of law school, this was not even close to what I considered a good legal job or job, period. I had worked in fast food joints in the Midwest that were more professional. And it could not have been clearer that the white man was the enemy. I ruined a suit jacket with armpit sweat because of the pressures of that place.</p>
<p>The supervisors weren&rsquo;t about to make the situation better. They mostly ignored the minority shenanigans, probably realizing it was useless to complain. If anyone had to respond to complaints about incompetence, it would be the lawyers, not the staff.</p>
<p>I wanted to quit, but the office required a commitment of three years. The only option was to ask for a transfer to another department or location. I did so, but was rejected. I appealed the rejection to a higher authority, who wanted to know why I wanted to leave so badly. I listed some of my experiences. She said they were serious accusations, and demanded details. I didn&rsquo;t want to say any more, for fear it would come back to me. In the end, I got the transfer to a whiter area without having to go into details.</p>
<p>The new office still had non-whites &mdash; particularly black women who felt it was their God-given right not to work &mdash; but it was probably more than half white. The cleanliness and the competence were a relief. Having just enough whites to tip the balance made a striking difference. It made &#8220;the practice of law&#8221; a reality instead of a joke, as it had been at the other office.</p>
<p>Those two work places were a kind of parable for America. So long as there are enough whites to maintain standards and set the tone, we can continue to be a First-World country despite a certain number of non-whites. But past the tipping point the jungle rushes in.</p>
<p>My first job out of law school was an experience I&rsquo;ll never forget. I think of it every time I hear whites dismiss concerns about becoming a minority in America as &#8220;racist paranoia.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Remember this article next time you hear about &#8220;middle class&#8221; blacks.  Most middle class blacks are useless affirmative action gov&rsquo;t workers who have no business in any kind of serious office job.  I can say from experience that blacks in working class jobs like janitors and fast food workers work harder and are more competent than these people.</p>

		<p>I left Michigan for a State with few minorities  around 1980 because I couldn&rsquo;t find an appropriate legal position as affirmative action ramped up.  Reading this account made me realize for the first time that what appeared bad luck at the time was actually fortunate.  My fate in time could well have been the same  as this poor lad&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what percentage the tipping point is. The Obama administration with it&rsquo;s Village People cabinet will still be working within a white infrastructure. I think it will be immensely entertaining to watch the &#8220;first family&#8221; over 4 years.</p>

One cannot help but feel sorry for the experiences this Law school graduate underwent, something many of us in now &#8220;diverse&#8221; neighborhoods suffer daily to one degree or the other.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we should not forget that it was the corrupt legal/political system itself that created this mess in the first place. Its likely to get worse, once the last light goes out</p>

		<p>When he mentioned subway I knew he was located in NYC.  I certainly can identify with his situation.  The incredible part of this is that Whites have no such camaraderie amongst themselves.  Most are silent. They just sit and suffer through these kinds of situations.  In any city, state or federal office where the &#8216;tipping point&rsquo; or &#8216;point of critical mass&rsquo; has been reached, all he described in his article comes to pass.  </p>

The American Renaissance web page has a &#8220;For Activists&#8221; section with flyers and pamphlets that can be distributed by people who want to spread the word.</p>
<p>I think that an article like this, printed up in a simple form, would probably be more effective among middle class whites. The reason is that this is thoroughly absorbing  &mdash;   it&rsquo;s like a piece of fiction that you can&rsquo;t put down. It doesn&rsquo;t start out with the premise that there is a political message to convey. So, people who pick it up to read it wouldn&rsquo;t have their guard up.</p>
<p>And, a person who reads an article like this realizes that there&rsquo;s a whole world out there that he doesn&rsquo;t see every day. Just like the author, he is an &#8220;outsider&#8221; until he enters this world and sees it close up.</p>
<p>After reading this, curiosity about American Renaissance would be very strong.</p>

		<p>There is a special synergy that occurs when a group of White guys work together. The best example is the control room scene in the &#8220;Apollo 13&#8221; movie. This was replicated  all across America on assembly lines, financial offices, corporate boards, construction crews,etc. Would Apollo have made it home with the mess described above in the control room? </p>
<p>The dire straits our finances are in is directly related to this article. Why can&rsquo;t the &#8220;Big 3&#8221; compete? Housing loans having trouble? What American brand of TV is the best to buy? </p>
<p>John wrote, So long as there are enough whites to maintain standards and set the tone, we can continue to be a First-World country. Not really, we only maintain the illusion of a First-World country. We go deeper into debt at $3.56 billion per day to maintain this illusion. Feel somewhat stressed? Well holding back the jungle is a stress-inducing full time occupation.</p>
<p>Many lofty articles have been written about the founding of our country. I boil it down to a group of White guys firing on all cylinders. </p>

True enough, but if this unfortunate experience is true for a &#8220;law school graduate&#8221;, then feel even sorrier for the rest of us working class whites do do not have that kind of cushion to fall back on.  </p>
<p>I can sympathize and identify with all of what he says here, but the fact is that, as a lawyer, he still occupied a relatively quite privileged position, so he did not get the worst of what it could have been.  </p>
<p>If you are a white person who does not have a law degree (or any degree), nor any other sort of special protection that education, money, or connections can give you   &mdash;   then you are in for some REAL experiences in today&rsquo;s working world!  That&rsquo;s when you will find out what it&rsquo;s all about   &mdash;   when you&rsquo;re tossed in with a bunch of low-class, mean, foul-mouthed, vicious blacks and then learn that you&rsquo;re officially and legally at the very bottom of the heap.  And everybody there is a &#8220;protected&#8221; class, but YOU!<br>

		<p>What a beautifully written article!  I hope John Ingram is at work on a book&hellip;.and that he will eventually write several.</p>
<p>Jackson, Mississippi is now controlled almost entirely by blacks.  The Mayor&rsquo;s hijinks, alone, are worth a google.  City gas cards are abused tens of thousands of times a year.  Every sort of incompetence and abuse is rampant.  But nobody can figure out where the money went for fixing the streets (which are beyond deplorable).  Mr. Ingram&rsquo;s article gave me a clue.  All those salaries to all those do-nothing city employees are going to nothing&hellip;poured down a rat hole.  The Russians would call it an &#8216;anti-product&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Now I understand.</p>

<p>Those do-nothing government jobs, chock full of so-called &#8220;minorities&#8221;,  are merely  a politer form of Welfare. They allow the recipients of those paychecks the dignity of pretending to earn a living and to consider themselves contributing members of society.  </p>
<p>They are also, I suppose, a sort of anti-riot insurance for the owning classes. Basically, they are a bribe to be good and not burn the city down.  It&rsquo;s easier to just pay them.</p>

Not necessarily. There&rsquo;s  a good chance of it,  but there are other possibilities too.</p>
<p><i>I certainly can identify with his situation. The incredible part of this is that Whites have no such camaraderie amongst themselves. Most are silent. They just sit and suffer through these kinds of situations. </i><br>
Posted by Awakened</p>
<p>So true!  Absolutely. I&rsquo;ve seen this myself, and repeatedly.  Some whites try to &#8220;fit in&#8221; and act black. Others are just cowed and sit silently, never complaining. There is no shared spirit, no comeraderie, or sense of support among whites. They are all separated and atomized, while the black &#8220;brothahs and sistahs&#8221; are a close-knit tribe.</p>
<p>I have seen all of this too.  I have worked in it.  I can particularly identify with what he said about the radios (all over the place!),  and some even have TV&rsquo;s on their desks, with Jerry Springer and the various &#8220;judge&#8221; programs blaring throughout the afternoons.  The great majority of these talk programs, I&rsquo;ve noticed, seem to center around figuring out who was really the father of So-and-so&rsquo;s child.  That&rsquo;s a common obsession with them.  Among whites, such a topic  (the questionable paternity of your child) would be considered an embarassment even to mention, and certainly not in public.  These programs draw a great deal of  participation and comments from the listeners. When now and then a fight breaks out on TV (predictably), the whole office comes to a stand-still while they cheer and root for their favorite.</p>
<p>In the mornings, we had one fellow who brought in tapes of gospel music and played them all morning long. Sometimes he&rsquo;d get carried away and sing and moan along with them.  Worst of all, this stuff wasn&rsquo;t even real &#8220;music&#8221;, it was just a minister doing a lot of  hysterical screeching  and shreiking  to the accompaniment of a choir in the background.  Do we have to listen to this?  Somebody&rsquo;s sermons???   Nobody ever complained! The blacks didn&rsquo;t seem to mind.  </p>
<p>On one occasion, a white woman who sat next to him was on the phone, trying to  make a call.   She turned  and asked him, &#8220;Could you please turn your gospel music down a bit?&#8221;  Those were her exact words, very politely requested.   He retorted,  &#8220;Oh!!!  You don&rsquo;t like GOSPEL Music?  Is there something about GOSPEL Music that you can&rsquo;t stand?  You mean you really  don&rsquo;t like <i>Black </i> music!&#8221;   She replied, &#8220;No, I didn&rsquo;t say that. I just asked you to turn it DOWN a little bit while I made this call.&#8221;  At that point, the other blacks in the office all got in on it, with comments like:  &#8220;But she DID say &#8220;<i>gospel</i> music&#8221;.  She couldn&rsquo;t say just turn down your &#8220;music&#8221;.  She had to say, &#8220;gospel&#8221; music!  Why did she have to say say THAT? </p>
<p>They can make a racial incident out of anything!   After that, nobody ever dared mention the gospel &#8220;music&#8221; again.  I myself brought in a pair of sound-deadening earmuffs.  It was the only way to maintain my sanity or get any work done.  They thought I was listening to music of my own, but I was listening to blessed silence.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, what Joe said  above about  most middle-class blacks being useless affirmative action products &#8220;who have no business in any kind of serious job&#8221;  is absolutely true.  That particular  guy (who played the gospel tapes) was an excellent example of it.   This moron was put through college on a football scholarship.  But even with that worthless degree of his, he couldn&rsquo;t talk, write,  or spell.  Still, he had a very good position in the organization, though he did very little (but listen to his sermons).<br>

<p>Multiculturalism knocked the wheels off of the purpose bus. There is no longer a common mission or office to rally around. As in this article Whites will aimlessly shuffle around and withdraw into themselves. Shared spirit? Towards what goal?</p>

<p>I think the British National Front had the cheapest way of doing this. Sell stickers that have the website adress imprinted on them. Then you can stick them in appropriate places where passerbys can notice them. You could make them different colors like flourescent orange, yellow, metallic finish. You could supply them in rolls like is done commercailly, or in sheets like kids purchase. Making them on a tape makes them easy to place unobstrusively without notice.</p>

		<p>Also if you are a female with blond hair, be careful how you comb it in the presence of these people. I did this once before a break and was confronted about it by a group of angry black women. Apparently this is considered rude and hostile towards them!</p>
<p>I just tonight talked to a saleswoman who was just laid off at Honeywell after thirty some years and has gone through 27 rounds of layoffs. Some of the people in the layoff meeting had the nerve to bring up the question of whether anyone in India is being laid off. They are not!!!</p>
<p>Apparently, we will stand up and speak - but only just as the axe is coming down on our heads.</p>
<p>Also talked to a pastor&rsquo;s wife, and she said these stories of layoffs are all they are hearing this year. Maybe this could lead to another type of church springing up all over the country. Talking candidly about our personal situations in a candid manner. It wouldn&rsquo;t take much.</p>
<p>Love the idea about business cards. You could lay them all over the place. Could be a new little MLM just for us. &#8220;Madoff - he&rsquo;s not the only one who made off with our country.&#8221; Or going out of business cards. &#8220;Everyone must go - 100 year liquidation sale.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Typical minority controlled office. I have had the great misfortune to work at several &#8220;call center&#8221; type of jobs where affirmative action reigns but is never called this by upper management. Most of the workers were white but almost all of the management from floor managers to upper management were minorites of some sort. They delighted in screaming and berating the poor white underlings as well as screaming and using obscenities at people on the phone. I learned quickly that if you wanted help you had to go to a white supervisor. I had a good performance record so I applied several times for open QA or management positions but was passed up in favor of blacks and hispanics. Even being a woman did not help me in this place. I quit to raise a family and will never go back to this line of work ever. It is possible that by the time I would think about work most of these jobs will have gone to India anyway. </p>

		<p>What an excellent article!  I truly feel bad that the writer had to go through what he did.  </p>
<p>I remember when I worked for a state-run psychiatric hospital.  Part of my job consisted of letting visiting social workers from outside agencies know when a patient was either admitted or was about to be released back into their county specific community.</p>
<p>One of these counties&rsquo; quality of work was so poor (need I mention the staff was about 80% black?) that it actually came under the scrutiny of state regulators.  Patient care was mediocre at best, but what was found was extreme abuse of credit cards that were supposed to be used for business purposes.  Staff used the cards to buy themselves stereos and TVs, take trips or any other luxuries that might come to mind.</p>
<p>The outcome of the investigation?  Yes, there was abuse of credit cards but more attention needed to be paid to their use.  The folks who charged their little toys on them were never reprimanded and got to keep their ill-gotten goods.  Unbelievable.</p>
<p>A white social worker from a different county came in one day and started filling out employment applications.  When I asked her why, she told me that she had been passed over for promotion 3 times while blacks who had been there only a year or so got the better jobs.  She also stated that she overheard the manager and another black woman say that their goal was to &#8220;make the office all black&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I myself was faced with a dilemma when my black supervisor brought me a grant proposal (later passed) to input into the computer that was requesting money for a program that would aid black patients in affording therapy.  It was very specific that it was for blacks only.  I dragged my heels doing this work because it disturbed me a great deal and I so wanted to point out how unfair this document was.  Like many faced with similar problems, I finally caved in and completed the proposal.  But I have never forgotten the blatant unfairness of its content.  It seemed I was the only one who even noticed this &#8220;little&#8221; fact.</p>
<p>The above article and what I have related above is going on all over the country every day.  With Obama, things can only get worse. </p>

		<p>Henry Stanton and William Hope are 100 percent correct about the synergy of whites working on a project.  We used to talk shop after hours, figuring out how to innovate and make things work just a little bit better.  Now, at my workplace, it would be pure fantasy to think of a black man staying even one minute after 5 p.m. if he wasn&rsquo;t ordered to so do.  Blacks just grind everything down to a shuddering halt with their attitudes, their laziness, their inabilty to care about the finished product, their pathologies, and their constant threat of lawsuits against the employer.  At my work, most the whites no longer care.  We punch the clock and go home.  <br>

<p>At work?   As the article (and other the posters) revealed, there is today no sense of unity or comaraderie  among whites. And in a place, such as the one described, where whites are such a small minority   &mdash;  -  this  fact, coupled with affirmative action and worries about EEO and &#8220;hate speech&#8221;   &mdash;  -   what few whites there are will not support you and do not dare even open their mouths.  Unfortunately, you cannot trust anyone at work to confide in.  If you value your job, there is nothing you can  afford to say   &mdash;    and nothing that they will say to you either.</p>

		<p>Is it any wonder after reading an article like this that companies are outsourcing their jobs overseas?  Granted, this is a city job but the decay is the same whether it&rsquo;s government or private industry.  When you consider the fact that the number of minorities will almost double in 50 years, the prospects for economic prosperity look dismal.  How is the US going to compete in 2050 when the national IQ drops into the 80s while Europe, China and Russia will be in the 100s?  It&rsquo;s not.  I think the best thing America should do right now while Whites are still the majority is to dismantle all nuclear weapons to keep them out of the hands of children.    </p>

		<p>John Ingram&rsquo;s personal account just about mirrored my 3 year assignment at the Defense Supply-Service department located in the Pentagon (yes that Pentagon)! I read his experience, shaking my head with recognition of some of the same &#8220;characters and attitudes&#8221;, but with admittedly better attire being the only difference. I was one of 3 whites in my office of about 50 civilian employees who oversaw the Pentagon&rsquo;s everyday supply needs. The reason for the high minority numbers was so the Defense Department could point to at least one department where they bent over backwards to accomodate them. I always thought they came up with the supply area to focus their quota hiring so they could do the least amount of harm. Even the phone conversations I had with contracted suppliers were identical, because of the federal government&rsquo;s desire for awarding &#8220;quota bids&#8221; when it came to assigning contracts to civilian supply sources. I can assure you that there are offices outside the &#8220;ghetto&#8221; that are similar.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s me, &#8220;ha,ha&#8221; again.<br>
At the clinic I worked at they watched porn and smoked dope all day.<br>
Same thing at the inner city hospital.<br>
And don&rsquo;t they do that at FoMoCo and GM, too?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be cavalier. Most whites can not get out of these &#8220;diverse&#8221; work situations and I sympathize with them.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m Hispanic but of White complexion (white skin, green eyes and light brown hair) and I can sympathize with this reader&rsquo;s experience. I have been given dirty looks even by my own Hispanic brethren, to them I am a &#8220;blanquito&#8221;. Although I have been fortunate enough to not have to work in such a volatile environment as this law student. </p>
<p>Whites are the most hated of all people. It is sad and unfortunate. Because without the White infrastructure, the world that we all love so dearly will fall apart. I am talking about a complete breakdown in society; a mountain of burning tires in the middle of the streets and black/latino psychopaths running around and machete-ing people to death. </p>
<p>Some people laugh at this drama but it is closer than you think. My solution is to bring back segregation. It may sound racist and extreme but i don&rsquo;t care anymore. it&rsquo;s this of complete hell and 3rd world chaos. I cannot be more serious. </p>

		<p>One of the really nice things about the recession is the falloff in government revenues.  Even the recent $50 billion Ponzi scheme meltdown, courtesy of Bernard Madoff, has a bright spot; the deluded investors paid income tax on the falsified &#8220;dividends&#8221; Madoff paid to them, which the government must now repay.  Additionally, their losses to this fraud are now tax-deductable.  This means the federal government could be out about half the total amount of the fraud in lost tax revenue on Madoff&rsquo;s scam alone.  Less money in government coffers means less money available to hire diversitoids to spend days in the office drinking alcohol and making personal calls.</p>
<p>Foreign governments have their own major financial problems to deal with now, as well; they will be much less inclined to purchase US government bonds.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of ridding working whites from the need to support nonproductive nonwhite affirmative action hires in government offices, this recession and the concurrent financial scandals are really a dream come true.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I think that an article like this, printed up in a simple form, would probably be more effective among middle class whites. The reason is that this is thoroughly absorbing &mdash;  it&rsquo;s like a piece of fiction that you can&rsquo;t put down.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a piece of fiction?  Really?  You&rsquo;re sure it isn&rsquo;t fiction? Oh, I&rsquo;m sure it is all true, uh huh, every last word of it.  Live in fear people, it makes you that much easier to be manipulated.  Pathetic.</p>

<p>A number of people here have said they can identify with it personally, from out of their own experience.  That&rsquo;s too many for it to be &#8220;a piece of fiction&#8221;.</p>
