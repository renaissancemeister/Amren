			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cindy Leise, Chronicle-Telegram (Elyria, OH), Dec. 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A controversial proposal to make Oberlin Ohio&rsquo;s first sanctuary city for illegal immigrants could be amended to allow police the ability to inquire about immigration status, according to City Manager Eric Norenberg. </p>
<p>Simply banning police from discussing the matter &ldquo;removed any flexibility for officers in the field,&rdquo; Norenberg said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The policy placed absolute restrictions on our police officers, and the alternative will address the general practice we expect police to follow,&rdquo; Norenberg said. </p>
<p>He met Tuesday with Steve Volk and Mark Fahringer, who are proponents of the sanctuary legislation, along with Police Chief Thomas Miller, who opposes the current version of the law. </p>
<p>Also attending the meeting were Oberlin City Council members David Ashenhurst, Sharon Soucy and Vice Chairman Jack Baumann, along with Barb Mehwald, chairwoman of the city&rsquo;s Human Relations Commission, which voted 4-to-1 to recommend the sanctuary resolution to Council. </p>
<p>The current version of the resolution prohibits police or other city officials from requesting information about the immigration status of any person except as required by law or court decision. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The proposal was sparked by Volk and Fahringer after seven illegal immigrants working at the Casa Fiesta restaurant were arrested in raids on July 23 and Oct. 30. </p>

		<p>Places that have unwanted illegals should put them on a bus and take them to Oberlin Ohio. Everyone should be happy.</p>
<p>The place that had immigrants they did not want is happy because they are gone. The folks in Oberlin are happy because they can feel good because they are helping their fellow man by giving sanctuary. The illegal immigrants are happy because they are still in the USA, and are living in a place where they are wanted so they don&rsquo;t have to worry about deportation. It just doesn&rsquo;t get any better then that.</p>

		<p>Oberlin was such a nice town, I don&rsquo;t know what happened to it. Oh right, there&rsquo;s an ultra-liberal private college in town. </p>
<p>This would be very bad for northeast Ohio&rsquo;s economic picture (I have friends there who still can&rsquo;t find steady work,) but what would it do to the nearby towns, who would be easy prey for the criminal illegals? My hometowns of Amherst and North Ridgeville are near Oberlin, and what will happen to them?</p>
<p>Frankly I&rsquo;m surprised that Lorain isn&rsquo;t a sanctuary city; that dump was always the prime supplier of Hispanics who moved into my school district, both in Amherst and Ridgeville.</p>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for Oberlin to reap the benefits of diversity, they deserve what they&rsquo;re asking for. In time, when the crime rate skyrockets, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll put their heads together and find some way to blame it on &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;.</p>

		<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, Oberlin is an isolated community about 35 miles SW of Cleveland which is the home to Oberlin College, one of the best liberal arts colleges in the country.  It is surrounded entirely by farmland and has, historically at least, been essentially crime-free.  Having visited the city hundreds of times prior to my leaving the area in 1990, I had never once seen a black or hispanic there, save for the VERY few who are enrolled there. Effectively, the town&rsquo;s entire existence is dependent on the success of the college. The people there truly live in a fantasy world, the city council in particular, enacting such ordinances so as to make Oberlin a &#8220;nuclear-free zone&#8221; during the height of the cold war, and the like.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity&#8221; has existed nominally in the city but they will grow to have preferred a few nukes if they truly unleash the poison that is the diversity pill.<br>

		<p>If a town full of liberal dingbats wants to fill itself with &#8220;day laborers&#8221; urinating on sidewalks, violent MS-13 gang-members, rapists, drunk, uninsured drivers and public-assistance soaks, I might say &#8220;more power to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say that because the down-side is that the liberals who do this to cities don&rsquo;t STAY PUT after fouling their own nests in this fashion.  They&rsquo;ll move to YOUR town or MY town and repeat the process, sure as the sun rises.</p>

		<p>From time to time, we pass through Oberlin, but from now on we will never stop or patronize.  We will do our best to let everyone that we know or who may be traveling near Oberlin, that Oberlin is a sanctuary city.  Sorry, but illegal means criminal.  The majority of American&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t care if they are nice people.  They steal jobs, benefits, and tax dollars from all of us.  I pray that the liberals at Oberlin College get what they deserve for their stupidity.</p>

		<p>Most of the local merchants know that this will cost them money in taxes to pay for legal &amp; illegal aliens &amp; lost customers who will avoid Oberlin.</p>
<p>My guess is this &#8220;sanctuary city&#8221; legislation will not fly.</p>
<p>Btw, the main FAA Communications Center is located in Oberlin  &mdash;  -nothing like having questionable aliens kicking around a highly sensitive communications installation.</p>

		<p>Just wait till some of those little white liberal girls get raped and killed at Oberlin College that will be great for enrollment. Of coarse it will be shut up but word will eventually get out. </p>
