<h1>BNP Landlord Arrested Over &lsquo;Cuttings&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>This Is Nottingham, December 08, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A PUB landlord has been arrested on suspicion of committing a racially-aggravated public order offence because of newspaper clippings on the wall.</p>
<p>Peter Mailer was arrested after a complaint from a senior Notts Police officer who visited the Black Bull in Warkworth, Northumberland, while on holiday.</p>
<p>Mr Mailer, who admits he is an active supporter of the British National Party, was hauled into the nearby Alnwick Police Station.</p>
<p>He has been bailed to return to the station on December 23, when he will learn whether or not the Crown Prosecution Service will charge him.</p>
<p>The 52-year-old said he was stunned to learn that the complaint had been made by the Notts officer. He said the officer had been in the pub with a friend and their wives. They chatted to him, but never mentioned the cuttings, which are mainly from national newspapers. Three days later, police arrested him and took everything off the walls.</p>

		<p>A lot of Brits ARE leaving for greener pastures - or should I say Whiter pastures.  Some are coming here to the U.S.  I&rsquo;ve even met one or two, but it&rsquo;s hard to get them to admit it&rsquo;s because of what England is becoming like due to illegal and legal immigration.  Even though they&rsquo;ve left because their country is starting to be overrun by non-White foreigners, many are very hesitant to admit, even to themselves, that it&rsquo;s because of multiculturalism.</p>

</i><p>Why not criminally charge the newspapers the cuttings were from?  If not, what then was the criminal act of the unfortunate landlord, mutilating newspaper copy, perhaps?</p></p>

		<p>And Britain&rsquo;s decay continues down the slippery slope of political correctness toward national oblivion.</p>
<p>Britain apparently wants an authoritarian government, and they&rsquo;re getting it   &mdash;   good and hard.</p>

		<p>Amazing. No wonder they have worked so hard to disarm the once proud British citizen. <br>
In another decade or two England will go under Muslim rule. I can only hope that the Liberal criminals who surrendered their country are the first to be forced to submit to Dhimmi status and to pay the Jizhya tax. </p>

		<p>I went to the orginal article and also perused a couple of other stories in this same newspaper. Some stories allow readers to post commentary. This story does not have that option. Curious indeed.</p>

<p>There,&hellip;.See?&hellip;..He&rsquo;s admitted it.  He belongs to a political party.  He has opinions.  Haul him away.</p>
<p>Britain is descending into tyranny.</p>
<p>In the sadistic and juvenile fantasy movie &#8220;V for Vendetta&#8221;, the degenerate Wachowski brothers portayed a tyrannical Britain under the control of nationalists.  This is almost a complete inversion of the real situtation that is developing.  It is the left/liberal/queer forces of &#8220;tolerance&#8221; who are enslaving Britain and turning that once great nation into a prison.</p>

		<p>This is just the latest example of how policing in the UK has been politicised by the EU-compliant New Labour government. While jihadis rant and rave in and outside mosques and nothing is done, a British nationalist is persecuted for posting newspaper cuttings on his pub wall by a police force desperate to find nationalists guilty of anything. In the Marxist EU(SSR) nationalism is the enemy and whites are the new kulaks. Let&rsquo;s hope if charges are brought the publican trump&rsquo;s the politicised Common Purpose police, and if not I hope he sues them.</p>
<p>Below is a picture of current EU President and &#8216;ex-Marxist&rsquo; Manuel Barosso of Portugal at a Marxist rally as a younger man. He is the man on the right looking down towards his feet. I&rsquo;m sure you Americans are familiar with the smiling man he is shaking hands with in the second picture. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all one big club and it has many names one of them being the NWO.</p>

		<p>Never forget one thing, folks. A majority of British voters want the government they now have. This majority approves of this man being arrested. </p>
<p>We here in the U.S. do the same thing, and we&rsquo;re not far behind Britain. </p>

		<p>Like other AmRen posters, I am baffled by the U.K. The BNP is a legitimate political party, and yet it&rsquo;s treated like some kind of outlaw group. Likewise, the British papers can run articles like this, but it&rsquo;s against the law to post them anywhere??? What bizarre times we live in. Of course, I can&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re any less confused in the U.S.</p>

		<p>Free speech is dead in Great Britain.  And the ADL wants to make sure that the same thing happens here.  With a Democratic lock on congress and the presidency, they are likely to get what they want.  The left thinks free speech only applies to pornography.<br>

		<p>  How does this differ from China&rsquo;s democracy wall, where wall posters were later arrested after the Tiananmen Square crackdown?<br>
Mao did the same thing in his &#8220;Let 10,000 flowere bloom&#8221; campaign. Britain has evolved into a totalitarian state like in <br>
V for Vendetta. </p>

		<p>This is the difference between the US and the UK.  People in the US are proud of their country and being Americans without the stigma of being &#8220;racists&#8221;.  In the UK, anyone waving the Union Jack or the Saint David&rsquo;s Cross in England are ridiculed and abused outside of national football matches.</p>

		<p>Ted at 12:41: It&rsquo;s the cross of St George, not St David.  The nation that has the Star of David on their flag has a much more accurate perception of the value of Moslem immigrants.</p>

		<p>No, Proactive, a majority of the UK population does NOT want &#8220;the government they now have&#8221;.</p>
<p>Our first-past-the-post electoral system delivers a parliamentary majority to the largest party at a General Election (i.e. the one with the most &#8220;seats&#8221; in the House of Commons), usually (as in the present case) with an actual minority of the popular vote cast. </p>
