<h1>Banks Drop Cash-Delivery Used by Somali Immigrants</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, November 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Every month, Sagal Warsme sends $400 to her mother and younger brother, Somali refugees who live in Kenya.</p>
<p>Warsme, 35, gives a check to a money-transfer company in Columbus that deposits it with other clients&rsquo; money at a bank. Then someone in Kenya contacts her mother and pays her a corresponding amount.</p>
<p>Without the bank account, the money transfer is illegal. But without the money, Warsme&rsquo;s family would find themselves in trouble.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thousands of Somali immigrants in central Ohio rely on money-transfer companies to help support their relatives living in refugee camps and war-stricken areas overseas, the Columbus Dispatch reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>But as more banks close their accounts, these companies are struggling to stay afloat.</p>
<p>The Somali American Chamber of Commerce estimates that 45,000 Somali-Americans in central Ohio rely on 11 such companies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Banks have been closing such accounts for years, but the last banks that support money transfers in central Ohio are currently leaving the business, said David Landsman, executive director of the National Money Transmitters Association.</p>
<p>National City terminated money-transferring accounts, and Huntington National Bank has given agencies until the end of the year to leave, according to the Somali chamber.</p>
<p>The last thing a bank wants is its name in a newspaper next to that of a money launderer or terrorist financier, Landsman said.</p>
<p>Huntington executives decided to close remittance-agency accounts because it costs too much to monitor them, spokeswoman Jeri Grier said.</p>

			<p>Every month, Sagal Warsme sends $400 to her mother and younger brother, Somali refugees who live in Kenya.<br>
How in this economy can a refugee, or anyone afford to give away $400 a month?  Wait, I have the answer&hellip;no income taxes for 10 yrs for immigrants, Food Stamps, WIC, Medicaid, Section 8, etc.  Isn&rsquo;t is nice to know you subsidize the hateful, arrogant, anti-American Somalis that live here and in Africa?</p>

			<p>There are 45,000 Somalis in Ohio?  That&rsquo;s a medium size town.  We are insane to allow this to happen.  Somali-American?  Not possible.</p>
<p>If the Somalis want to transfer funds to pirate central I suggest they stuff the money in suitcases and deliver it personally.</p>

Every one of these leeches that sends money home should be checked out, and if they&rsquo;re on assistance that money should be seized and given back to the state. God we&rsquo;re a nation of suckers aren&rsquo;t we!!! </p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s the first reason this should be exposed and stopped. If not terrorists, you can be sure criminals are using this to their advantage.<br>

<p>45,000 Somalis in Central Ohio alone???  This is sheer madness!  What fools brought them here?   And, btw, what is this  &#8220;Somali-American&#8221; nonsense?</p>
<p>Furthermore, a hundred dollars a week is a huge amount in Kenya.  It  must allow her mother to live there like a queen.   And, I could add, how does Miss Sagal get this money? Does she work,  or is it welfare? </p>
<p>With such a number of Somalis alone, plus all the other millions of aliens,  sending money out of the country, no wonder the US dollar is in such distress and in danger of collapse.</p>

			<p>The voluntary repatriation of Somalis must take place before the exiles get too settled.  </p>
<p>No landlord signs an unlimited contract with a tenant.  An immigrant is like a tenant who takes over part of your house, and will eventually want you to move into the guest room.  </p>

			<p>It is nothing short of criminal that our government would allow money to be wired out of this country by aliens and &#8220;immigrants&#8221; (legal or otherwise) who are allowed to accept welfare benefits and free medical care.  Every extra dime in their grubby paws should be returned to the taxpayers on whose backs these aliens are allowed to stand.</p>

Forty-five THOUSAND?! &#8220;Somali-Americans&#8221;?? Just in Central Ohio ALONE?! It is time for every White American to become comfortable saying &#8220;I hate the United States.&#8221; Only when we get past the shallow, childish sloganeering of &#8220;patriotism&#8221; can we set to toppling the murderour, barbarous, traitorous FedGov.</p>

			<p>There are way more than 45,000 here. Columbus is a sanctuary city. Columbus is second only to Minneapolis in the Somali racket. It is becoming part of the Dhimmi. they are building separate rec centers on the east side for the muslims who can&rsquo;t stand boys and girls playing together. complete with footbaths and prayer rooms. it&rsquo;s disgusting. </p>

			<p>The real question is how many Somolis were originally settled in Ohio and what is their birth rate?  Assuming that 1/3 are females at least 12 years old, if they each have a baby a year, that&rsquo;s 15000 more every year, so the number will double in 3 years, and triple in 6.  Of course then they will need a super mosque, and will want to be subject only to Sharia law!</p>
<p>Within 20 years I would bet there will be a million of them in Ohio. </p>
<p>Oh boy!</p>

			<p>&#8220;a hundred dollars a week [goes a long way] in Kenya. It must allow her mother to live there like a queen. &#8220;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
What does she do with it all?  Where does she shop?  Is there a branch of Neiman-Marcus in her refugee camp?</p>
<p>After all, how many bags of rice does a refugee need?  <br>

<p>Hahahaha right you are HH, I use the opening scenes of that movie to point out exactly what happens, and continues to happen, to any sort of aid sent to any African country. I saw the same thing in South East Asia and Central America, some things never change.</p>

<p>If it comes from welfare, and I bet it does, no AR readers could find out because almost certainly the welfare case is handled by blacks, if not Somali blacks!!! Irony Irony Irony.</p>

			<p>At one time Ohio was Republican state.  Then the black Democratic mayor of Columbus decided to import Somalis and Nigerians aka ready-made Democrats.  I work in corrections in Ohio, and I work with Nigerians and Somalis.  I have overheard them say they don&rsquo;t pay income taxes.  I read that Snopes article, so I wonder if someone can clear this up.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure the &#8216;45,000&rsquo; is a revolving number as more of them move to Columbus, and many of the ones already there move around to various places across of the country the same as everyone else does. </p>
<p>I wonder if the Columbus dispatch and the local schools and universities feel these Somali enclaves, racially exclusive area&rsquo;s, deserve more &#8216;diversity&rsquo;? Is it not evil when whites band together all in one place and don&rsquo;t welcome outsiders? It seems these folks have a leg-up on white evil already and they&rsquo;ve only been here for a couple decades. </p>

<p>Probably both.  Welfare under one social security number, work under another social security number.</p>
<p>And of course she can slack off work, get fired and then win millions claiming discrimination.</p>
<p>Maybe the hispanic takeover of my home state, California isn&rsquo;t so bad after all.  The average hispanic IQ is in the 80&rsquo;s, 20 points higher than the average Somalian IQ.  Hispanics come from a more or less christian mixed spanish indian culture, far less dangerous than the primitive islam practiced in Somalia.</p>

 I&rsquo;m already saying &#8221; I hate the United States&#8221; It&rsquo;s not the white man&rsquo;s world anymore.I hate what the traitors have done to this country.I feel no more loyalty to it than the man in the moon.I no longer bother to vote in Presidential elections.I don&rsquo;t have much stomach anymore to even vote locally.I only feel loyalty to my small community.Of course,I still feel loyalty only to the South.But,even this is fading away.Either we&rsquo;ll have to stand and fight,or we&rsquo;ll all die together as a people.</p>
