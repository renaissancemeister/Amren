<h1>Wright: Obama Made &lsquo;Bad&rsquo; Choice to Distance Self, But It&rsquo;s OK</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maureen O&rsquo;Donnell, Chicago Sun-Times, December 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President-elect Barack Obama made a &#8220;bad decision&#8221; by distancing himself from the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and his church, Wright said Sunday &mdash; but that&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s still my child,&#8221; Wright said in a sermon in which he expressed pride in Obama&rsquo;s longtime association with Trinity United Church of Christ.</p>
<p>His talk was spiced with his trademark blend of history lesson, mimicry, singing, and &mdash; depending on your point of view &mdash; insults, or telling it like it is. One object of contempt seemed to be Elisabeth Hasselbeck of ABC&rsquo;s &#8220;The View,&#8221; whom &mdash; while not saying her name &mdash; Wright twice referred to as a &#8220;broad,&#8221; including once as &#8220;that dumb broad.&#8221; Hasselbeck has criticized Wright on &#8220;The View.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The hatred of the media and the haters in politics may have caused him to distance himself from us, but the love of Christ will never allow me to distance myself from him,&#8221; Wright said of Obama. &#8220;I can no more disown him than I can disown any other child of mine who makes [a] bad decision. He made a bad decision, but he&rsquo;s still my child.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Wright also said that December 7 was the day the US dropped the bomb on Japan, obviously unaware that Decenber 7th was the day that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in an unprovoked, sneak attack that killed and maimed thousands of US military men and several civilians.</p>
<p>The man is an absolute fool, but he&rsquo;s about average so far as anti-white hating racists go.  He has plenty of company on that score.</p>

<p>But the love of Christ allows you to call a woman &#8220;that dumb broad&#8221; from the pulpit?  Nice.  I guess my church is boring, because no one would EVER say anything so crass from our pulpit.  </p>
<p>I wish Obama would just go all the way and invite Rev. Wright to be his White House Champlain.  Why not show the world what you are?  Keepin&rsquo; it real!  </p>

		<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s decisions both to associate and disociate with Wright were politically motivated.  Obama was raised in the White world and is a mulatto.  He needed credibility with his black Chicago constituency.  Once he gained a national audience he had to repudiate Wright.  Wright is nothing more than a clown who performs his anti-white, anti-USA, anti-capitalist shtick quite literally to the choir.  I do not believe Obama&rsquo;s worldview is that of Wright or of the democrat version of &#8220;Joe the Plumber&#8221;, Peggy Joseph.  Obama is a university left winger, the only difference from his tenured friends is that Obama is actually in the political game and his moves are informed by political gamesmenship.  Wright will have no influence on the Obama administration.  Unfortunately, that won&rsquo;t matter.</p>

		<p>This is the guy who gave a lifetime achievement award to Louis Farrakhan.  So Reverend Wright does know something about hate.  However, I do agree with Wright on one thing   &mdash;   I also wish Obama had not been so hasty to distance himself from his mentor of 20 years.  Then he wouldn&rsquo;t be president elect today.<br>

<p>The original article notes that Father Michael Pflegler was also in attendance and Wright called him &#8220;my main man&#8221;. But where was the 3rd Stooge Louis Farrakhan?   </p>

		<p>Using God to justify hate and racism is blasphemy. What a coward Wright is, hiding behing his religion to spew his unGodly rhetoric.  If only people were smarter enough to not listen to this poor excuse of a human.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind this black president&rsquo;s white-hating pastor was running a church that was filled will such white-hating blacks they reveal the Jesus icon as black in all their graphic depictions of him.  </p>
<p>Nobody can offer an exact replica of what the Christ figure looked like, but it&rsquo;s more than obvious he was a Semitic caucasoid who probably had an olive complexion, as did the   majority of people in that area during that period of time, except for most Romans.  The skin, hair and eyes, of caucasoids comes in all hues.  </p>
<p>In fact I might point out that it&rsquo;s a real possibility that he was of a lighter skin tone, tanned by the strong Middle Eastern sun, because whites literally inundated the area in huge numbers from 5000 B.C. onward, but no whites I know of ever projected him as blond hair or blue eyes, as some white haters have alleged.</p>
<p>If he were of the black race, it would have been mentioned in historical writings numerous times, but, of course, it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So for blacks to want to depict him as a black with an afro, as the black theologists do, reveals their despicable hatred of whites or their cousins, because they couldn&rsquo;t stand worshipping anyone other than a black.</p>
<p>And this fact only adds to the data indicating that Obama couldn&rsquo;t have frequented such an environment of white-hating people for over twenty years, without their hateful attitudes affecting him to an appreciable degree.</p>

		<p>It seems that Blagojevich was willing to compromise himself for relatively modest amounts.  Though not a bank, could one church as large as Wright&rsquo;s launder hard cash of such magnitude or transfer similar monies without detection?</p>
