<h1><a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3850797,00.html">French Headscarf Ban Not Discrimination, Says European Court</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deutsche Welle, December 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Europe&rsquo;s top courts have ruled in favor of a French school that expelled two Muslim girls for refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes. The ruling fuels the debate over secularism in France.</p>
<p>The European Court of Human Rights has dismissed a complaint by two French Muslim girls that their school violated their freedom of religion and their right to an education. The girls were expelled after repeatedly refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes.</p>
<p>The teacher had said that wearing a headscarf was incompatible with physical education classes. The girls, Belgin Dogru and Esma-Nur Kervanci, are French nationals and were 11 and 12 respectively when they were expelled from the school in the north-western town of Flers in 1999.</p>
<p><b>For secularism&rsquo;s sake</b></p>
<p>Based in Strasbourg, the European Court of Human Rights ruled on Thursday, Dec. 4 that the school&rsquo;s move to expel the girls was not out of line, emphasizing that the girls had been able to continue their education via correspondence classes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was clear that the applicants&rsquo; religious convictions were fully taken into account in relation to the requirements of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and public order,&#8221; the court said in a press release.</p>
<p>The court also observed that the purpose of the restriction on the applicants&rsquo; right to manifest their religious convictions was to adhere to the requirements of secularism, a hot topic of debate in France.</p>
<p>Secularism is taken very seriously in the country&rsquo;s state schools, and in 2004 a law was passed that bans pupils from wearing conspicuous signs of their religion at school.</p>
<p>France is home to Europe&rsquo;s largest Muslim minority.<br/>

		<p>This is so typical of the marxist world view.  People are a blank slate, and are to be manipulated by the self appointed elite.  They won&rsquo;t think twice about allowing the non French to invade France, because by forcibly banning head scarves the invaders will turn into the French.  </p>

		<p>Headscarves or not these &#8220;French&#8221; girls will probably be married off to some 35-year-old lech before they are much older, so they won&rsquo;t get to use any education they may have aquired so far anyway. They will be kept busy replacing the population of France with happy little Muslims fed off French welfare and filled with glorious stories of jihad and the 72 virgins they will get when they bite the hand that feeds them.</p>

		<p>I write this post from France.</p>
<p>Much is said about France being full of muslims. It is an unfortunate legacy of the African colonies. Yes their are a lot but they are confined to very specific places. This means that you can travel France and hardly ever see any.</p>
<p>Where I live there are none. The largest employer is a giant pork factory! A friend of mine has actually seen muslims who have turned up at the mayors office looking for housing and money being turfed out by the Gendarmes. They are not allowed to buy properties (no muslim restaurants) as owners are &#8220;leant upon&#8221; by the authorities and the Gendarmes who train at my gym and work away at a large town tell me the muslims are heavily controlled.</p>
<p>They know how bad these people and their religion can be. That is why secularism is being forced upon them.</p>
<p>Reassuringly, despite the secular policy, our local church has just been renovated using local, regional, national and EU funds! Such funds are not allowed for mosques as they are deemed not to be a part of the cultural history of France.  </p>

This is a step in the right direction. We have problems with the same kind of people in Turkey.</p>
<p>Keep France and Turkey the US secular (Church and State should remain separated</p>

		<p>It never ceases to amaze me why a group of people (muslims) who are so ardent about adhearing to their strict religious guidelines would move to such a strongly secular nation.  </p>
<p>Why?  To creat conflict?  Why not stay in a muslim country where your beliefs are respected and encouraged?</p>
<p>It is like going a Metallica concert then complaining the music is way too loud and demand they turn it down.</p>
