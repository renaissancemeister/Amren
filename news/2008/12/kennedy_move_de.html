			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexander Bolton, The Hill, December 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sen. Edward Kennedy&rsquo;s (D-Mass.) allies on immigration reform regard his departure from the Judiciary Committee as a withering blow to their cause and are searching for a new champion on the controversial issue.</p>
<p>Many are interpreting his decision to focus on healthcare as a setback to legislation that would put millions of illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship.</p>
<p>Kennedy&rsquo;s own health has some speculating that the liberal icon sees healthcare as his best chance to augment his legacy while he battles brain cancer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some see his decision to leave his post as chairman of the Judiciary Immigration subcommittee as a sign that Democrats will hold off on the topic in the 111th Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve had this conversation with a couple people and I would say that Kennedy&rsquo;s loss from the Judiciary Committee is disappointing,&#8221; said Randel Johnson, vice president of labor, immigration and employee benefits at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which was a major supporter of Kennedy&rsquo;s legislation. &#8220;It will adversely affect immigration reform going forward. It indicates the chances of comprehensive reform happening over the next few years are slim.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in previous interviews has said the Senate will take up immigration reform in the 111th Congress, some proponents doubt President-elect Obama and Democrats will make the issue a top priority during the first years of his administration.</p>
<p>Rahm Emanuel, who will serve as White House chief of staff, predicted last year that immigration reform would not happen in the first term of a Democratic presidency.</p>
<p>Emanuel, who has seen immigration as a dangerous issue for Democrats, repeatedly battled members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to block consideration of an immigration package in the House while he was a member of the House Democratic leadership.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is next in line on the Immigration subcommittee. Immigration reform advocates describe Feinstein as a &#8220;fair&#8221; and &#8220;independent&#8221; legislator but not as passionate an advocate as Kennedy. She could also have her hands full if chosen as chairwoman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence next year.</p>
<p>Indeed, few lawmakers seem eager to play as prominent role as Kennedy &mdash; even logical successors such as Sen. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.), who is one of three Hispanic senators.</p>
<p>A Salazar aide said his boss will play the same role in the immigration debate as he has in the past.</p>

		<p>I think the Kennedy thing is a bromide.  The Democrats don&rsquo;t want to push amnesty or anything that sounds like amnesty, because (1) They don&rsquo;t want white conservative reaction accruing to Republicans in 2010, and (2)  A lot of Senate Democrats, e.g. Claire McCaskill (MO) aren&rsquo;t for amnesty or soft amnesty.</p>

		<p>I just love how people from failed black, asian, muslim and mestizo countries pour into successful white societies, and immediately procede to tell the white societies what is wrong with them, and how they are going to fix them. Its happening as we speak, in every single wihte society around the globe.</p>

		<p>I would never wish Sen. Kennedy&rsquo;s condition upon him or anyone else, but I am very glad that he apparently will not have the opportunity to follow up his pushing through the 1965 Immigration Act with a second, equally devastating measure.</p>

		<p>If justice had been served years ago, Kennedy would rightly have served time for manslaughter in the death of his female companion who drowned due to his reckless, and very likely, drunken driving, and his decision to leave the scene of the accident without trying to rescue her.</p>
<p>I saw a detailed narrative on T.V. regarding the facts in the case, and Kennedy&rsquo;s account of the situation is obviously false.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve no doubt his influence and money protected him from prosecution, and such negligence and lack of presecution I hope is rated by historians as one of the great crimes of the century.</p>
<p>Without him in the Senate, this country wouldn&rsquo;t be so far down the road to complete implosion I&rsquo;m sure, and the multicultural problem wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as great and quite possibly might have been curtailed at some point.  Certainly it would have been lessened considerably.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely pitiful that he&rsquo;s insisting on contributing more evil before he departs this plane of existence, rather than attempting to make amends for the many crimes he&rsquo;s responsible for or butt out of politics for good and spend time with his dysfunctional family as he should.</p>

		<p>Kennedy and his relentless push to bring in scores of non-whites has harmed our country more than anyone in history. I think he hates America because of what happed to his brothers and I do not wish Kennedy well. He is a man of inherited wealth who claims he speaks for &#8220;the little guy&#8221; but has no idea of what faces little guys who lose their jobs to Kennedy&rsquo;s beloved immigrants. This man alone has, since 1965 changed the face of the best country in history, and certainly not for the better. We now live in a balkanized overcrowded country with increasing problems of all kinds due to Kennedy&rsquo;s immigration push. For the sake of his family I hope he recovers enough to have some kind of a life. But for the sake of the country I hope his health forces him to leave the Senate. And soon. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Randel Johnson, vice president of labor, immigration, and employee benefits&#8221;!? I wonder if either he or anyone else at the Chamber of Commerce even sees the irony in that title. This reminds of a scene from The Tin Drum: Joe Colchik (the American immigrant millionaire) is described making his fortune; he does so by selling matches, then lumber, and finally fire insurance.</p>

		<p>Of all the asinine euphamisms employed by the PC Washington crowd, few are more misleading than this &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; or worse yet, &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; nonsense! These people want &#8220;reform&#8221; like I want a few more illegals in this country. They want amnesty and open borders and nothing less than that - most don&rsquo;t even pretend to want otherwise. Why has no one challenged this &#8220;reform&#8221; canard? </p>

		<p>Kennedy was one of the original designers of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act which in 2008 is in the end stages of destroying America&rsquo;s White majority and Western heritage.  For you younger people out there, America was a wonderful place back in the days before the so called civil rights agenda.  Crime was almost unheard of in many parts of this country and people could walk down the streets at night without batting an eye.  The congoloids were segregated from the rest of society and White children would actually learn things in school instead of being held back by inferiors.  America was second to nobody in the world.  Now, here we are a generation away from being outnumbered by people who&rsquo;ve been nothing but a burden on our civilization.  If your young I suggest moving out of the country because there won&rsquo;t be any future here for you.  The US is a rapidly fading power and in the future even basic services like electricity and running water might be considered luxuries in many areas of the country.</p>

		<p>Kennedy isn&rsquo;t entirely stupid - he knows you can&rsquo;t sell Democratic voters on Amnesty in the middle of the worst recession in decades.  If by some miracle both Kennedy and the economy improve their health, he&rsquo;ll come back and try again.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to see Ted Kennedy leave the Judiciary Committee.  Unfortunately the Democratic majority is certain to replace him with someone just as bad on the illegal immigration issue.  That&rsquo;s why, as much as I despise the way the war mongers have taken over the Republican party, I can not vote for Democrats.<br>

<p>On October 30, 2008, the 3rd Circuit held oral argument in the case of Lozano v. City Of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, Docket number 07-3531, on whether the proposed local Ordinance which require a license to rent and work is pre-empted by federal immigration law. Kris W. Kobach, Immigration Law Professor, (816) 235-2390, kobachk@umkc.edu, who appears on Lou Dobbs television show once in a while, represented the Appellant. Omar C. Jadwat and Witold J. Walczak represented the Appellees.  My guestimate is that the panel will render their decision by the beginning of March of 2009.  </p>
<p>In the law review article entitled Civilian Border Patrols: Activists, Vigilantes, or Agents Of Government, by Adalgiza A. Nunez, Volume 60, Number 3, Rutgers Law Review 797-823 [Spring 2008], the author, apparently a supporter of Council Of La Raza, supports the idea of filing lawsuits against everybody who interferes with anybody who illegally crosses the Southern Border.</p>

Regoeczi, Cleveland State University, Journal of Health and Social Behavior 2008, Vol. 49 (September): 254-268, examining the question of gender-equivalent outcomes of mental health and social behavior in the context of crowding stress.</p>

<p>According to the higly skilled and experienced rescue team and Medical Examiner she survived for several hours in the car.  The car did not fill with water immediately.  There was a large air pocket.  She was in that air pocket.  </p>
<p>But after several hours she used up all the oxygen in the air pocket and died.</p>
<p>If Kennedy had reported the accident immiediatly instead of checking into a motel and hiding out for 12 hours, Mary Jo would have been rescued.</p>
<p>Because of the ocean, swimming, boating and tourism, the area has highly skilled coast guard and rescue teams readily available.</p>

<p>  Quite right, the man is a coward and a bounder, who left his female companion to drown while he mysteriously disappeared for several hours. It&rsquo;s only his name and influence that kept him from serving time. By the way, I don&rsquo;t think our elites have given up on &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; even with Senator Kennedy out of the picture. I&rsquo;m sure they will try some underhanded way of passing Shamnasty. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard it stated before that Kennedy wanted to take down the WASP establishment via this immigration policy. The idea being that the age old war between the English and the Irish would be settled here in the States. Like you, I believe Kennedy probably dealt the single worst blow to the US. Virtually every ill in society can be linked to the 1965 Immigration Act when you truly examine it. The national identity, religous identity, ethnic identity, family identity and self identity in this nation has been altered to some degree, at least, by the 1965 Immigration Act, that Kennedy sponsored.</p>

		<p>With his backing of the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, Kennedy could not have done a worse act of treason to the unsupecting American public. He LIED to Americans, when he assurred them over and over that this Act would NOT change the demographics of the U.S.(which as a 90%, unified, WONDERFUL place, as well as a safe place(at least where there were no Blacks). <br>
Now, 43 years later, we have exactly the opposite: a multicultural, mongrelized mess.  Thank God he won&rsquo;t be around to finish his coup de gras, (or final blow) to America&rsquo;s Whites. By mid-century, we&rsquo;ll be a minority, thanks to him. A rapid decline will follow as government institutions fall into minority rule.</p>

		<p>Watch out, guys.  That leaves just one person to step in to save the day where &#8220;Immigration Reform&#8221; is concerned and that&rsquo;s John McCain. That was the first thing he and President-Elect Obama talked about and both agree it must be done.  I believe this thing will be pushed through with John McCain as &#8220;Republican Senior Statesman&#8221; at the helm to do it.  This way, there is no way the Republicans can use this against the Democrats during the next elections.  My bet is that McCain will do it, too.  The worst thing that ever happened was him leaving that POW camp alive.</p>
