			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Brussels Journal, December 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A press release from Gerard Batten MEP:</p>
<p>SHOWING OF THE FILM FITNA BANNED BY ORDER OF THE CONFERENCE OF PRESIDENTS</p>
<p>It is with great regret that I have to announce the cancellation of the showing of the film Fitna at the meeting with Mr Geert Wilders MP today at 2pm.</p>
<p>I was informed of this decision today.</p>
<p>Nevertheless a press conference will take place at 2pm in room R 3.1 with Mr Wilders and myself.</p>
<p>The banning of this film is a direct attack on free speech. A parliament that constantly talks of freedom, democracy and tolerance has shown once again that these are empty words when it does not agree with what is being said.</p>
<p>On the same day that the European Parliament awards the Sakharov Prize to the Chinese freedom campaigner Hu Jia the Conference of Presidents deny free speech to one of its own members.</p>
<p>The press conference is open to MEPs and their assistants as well as accredited members of the press.</p>
<p>Anyone who wishes to view Fitna before the meeting can do so by going to <a href="https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=216_1207467783" target="Fitna" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"> www.liveleak.com/view?i=216_1207467783.</a></p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Gerard Batten MEP<br>
UK Independence Party<br>

		<p>The EU is a monster in a suit. The sooner Europeans kill it, the better. It does nothing but lie to the people. Is it a democracy? It claims to be, but I bet the French, Dutch and Irish would disagree. Does it believe in free speech? It says it does, then it bans it every chance it gets.</p>

		<p>Every country in Europe bans all kinds of things that are protected by free speech in America.  Islam is not the only Ethno-Religious group that can&rsquo;t be criticized in Europe and it certainly isn&rsquo;t the group that the laws were originally written to protect.  Most of the people complaining about this kind from here in America are very selective about what cases they mention.  </p>

&#8220;Conference gives freedom prize to Chinese, denies freedom to own members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Precisely. Here in Germany &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221;, though theoretically a constitutionally guaranteed right, does simply not exist in practise. </p>
<p>(just as there should be no censorship - also according to the constitution - and yet all papers and TV channels seem to miraculously agree on everything PC and liberal in the American sense of the term and sweep under the rug whatever event contradicts their version of the truth) <br>
There is no such thing as &#8220;partial&#8221; or &#8220;limited&#8221; freedom of speech. </p>
<p>You either have the freedom to say what you truly believe or you don&rsquo;t.<br>
 <br>
Freedom of speech must necessarily include the freedom to say things that have the potential to offend  a lot of people and stir up emotions - for whoever decides its limits automatically imposes his views in so doing.</p>
<p>And I cannot think of a single reason an honest person or group should have any interest in curbing the free expression of ideas and beliefs. </p>
<p>When you need to employ repression and penal legislation to support your claims, your case must be very convincing indeed.</p>
<p>At least free speech is still legally protected in the US, but actually using that right may still cost you.<br>
The social pressure to conform with the views propagated by the media probably works just as well. </p>
<p>And  &#8220;democracy&#8221; is a very loosely defined concept considering how often our leaders profess acting in its name - many risked and lost their lives trying to escape from the former (eastern) &#8220;German Democratic Republic&#8221;. </p>

[Or what they think <i>ought </i> to be the truth!]</p>
<p>There is no such thing as &ldquo;partial&rdquo; or &ldquo;limited&rdquo; freedom of speech.  You either have it, or you don&rsquo;t. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;When you need to employ repression and penal legislation to support your claims, your case must be very convincing indeed.&#8221; </i><br>
  &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;     <br>
While I agree 100% with the idea expressed in his excellent post above, I think he meant instead to say that  <b>if you need to employ repression and penal legislation to support your position,  then  <i>your case must be very flimsy and UN-convincing indeed! </i> </b>  Why else would you need to threaten and terrorize people into agreeing with you?  Or at least to silence them, if you can&rsquo;t force them to agree!</p>
<p><br>
But as he said,  <b>social pressures to conform to the views of the [semi-official] media seem to work very nearly as well.   </b>Being a non-conformist who holds unpopular, disapproved opinions places you beyond the safety of the pale, outside the protection of the herd. That is a very risky and uncomfortable position that most people do not care to be in   &mdash;   no matter what consitutional protections they may have, even if only in theory.</p>
<p>I might add one more thing of my own.  It is little short of miraculous, and certainly astounding, to be old enough to have witnessed the complete reversal of popular wisdom and opinion that has overtaken our culture within the past 40 or so years   &mdash;    all of this transformation being accomplished by the unremitting pressures of officialdom, academia, and the  information/entertainment media &hellip;  all of them working hand-in-hand.   All of  those  social attitudes which were once accepted as perfectly normal and beyond question by our grandparents are now regarded with contempt as backward and ignorant by our presumably wiser grandchildren.  It makes you wonder if there is really any such thing as &#8220;progress&#8221; at all!</p>

		<p>The same terminal sickness is present in Canada, debatably even more so than in Europe with our racism inquisitors and their star chambers they call &#8220;human rights commissions&#8221;. These abominations, which have sprung up like poisoned toadstools, in effect do what the E.U is doing here- strangling the arleady weak voice of it&rsquo;s ruled White people, who are either indiginous or the creators of their civilizations. All dying powers clamp down on thier citizenary, and the sicker they become the more they have to crush dissent from the ruled target population- it&rsquo;s Whites.</p>

<p>The Netherlands a democracy is a farce and that politically correct disease has been spreading like wildfire in the rest of Europe because the Netherlands is considered the trendsetter of progress&hellip;yeah right instead of utopia its taking us right back to the barbaric and inhumane dark ages.<br>

		<p>Islam infestation is but a symptom of the disease that has Europe on its deathbed.  That disease is marxism.  The mulims will take over when the Whites have reduced themselves to a small and ineffectual lot.  They won&rsquo;t even be worth forcibly converting.  Christendom is dead.  The remnant is simply fading away.  But on the bright side, the muslims will probably settle all the &#8220;gay&#8221; issues once and for all.</p>

<p>I have spent several years in muslim countries and you&rsquo;re correct! their sex appetites are barbaric and hypocritical. Saudis would rather have sex with young black boys than their own very beautiful women, but condemn others for doing so. Toatally disgusting the muslim faith and it&rsquo;s practitioners. Of course, the Saudi and Kuwaiti women would rather have sex with American men which doesn&rsquo;t help relations with them.</p>
