<h1>House Ethics Panel Expands Rangel Investigation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The House ethics committee is expanding an investigation of Rep. Charles Rangel, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. The ethics panel issued a statement Tuesday saying it had voted to expand an already far-ranging probe into the New York Democrat to examine whether he protected an oil drilling company from a big tax bill when the head of that company pledged a $1 million donation to a college center named after the congressman.</p>
<p>The move means the Rangel inquiry will likely stretch well past early January, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had previously said she expected the matter to be resolved.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The committee will now investigate contributions or pledges of money made to the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York, particularly one made by Eugene M. Isenberg, CEO of Nabors Industries, Ltd.</p>
<p>Rangel, 78, reportedly helped preserve a tax loophole that saved the company tens of millions of dollars a year.</p>
<p>The congressman, who has been in office for 40 years, maintains he has done nothing improper, and he says he has always opposed the kind of change to tax law that would have cost Nabors dearly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The committee has already been probing Rangel&rsquo;s failure to pay taxes on about $75,000 in rental income from a beach house he owns in the Dominican Republic. They are also eyeing his use of three rent-stabilized apartments in Harlem, including one for a campaign office. Also under scrutiny are letters Rangel wrote on congressional stationery looking to drum up donors for the college center.</p>

<p>They have won it all, for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p>They have a multicultural mulatto harbinger of &#8220;things to come,&#8221; ready for an invasion of the White House.</p>
<p>And yet, it all echoes 1994?</p>
<p>I hope this time, the Stupid Party gets it right???</p>

		<p>&hellip;.insists he has done nothing wrong. So what else is new. Stevens of Alaska did nothing wrong. Jefferson of New Orleans did nothing wrong. The latest clown the Governor of Illinois has &#8220;done nothing wrong.&#8221; How much corrupiton will it take till the American citizenry gets off of its taxpaying  and starts to literally get rabid with these &#8220;representatives&#8221;. Perhaps by accepting it all, we are getting what we deserve.</p>

		<p>Rangel will get away with it. He is protected. Criticize him and be called a racist.<br>

<p>HH, I am a firm believer that hope sprigs eternal.</p>
<p>Now with the Stupid Party, such hope often ends in tears; up to this point, eternally so.</p>
<p>But things do change, so maybe they have learned their lesson this time?</p>
<p>Let us hope so at least!</p>
<p>All the best to you HH,</p>

		<p>How many scandals have there been involving Congressmen,, Senators, and other government &#8220;servants&#8221; in the last few years. It seems like I read about at least one scandal every two weeks. It brings me to the point of wondering if there are any honest people left to investigate the alleged thieves. This nation is in deep,deep,trouble in more ways, it seems, than can be imagined. Talk about a lack of leadership. It is way beyond that.</p>
