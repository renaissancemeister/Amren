			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Allen, The Hill, December 22, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) are disappointed President-elect Obama did not appoint more African-Americans to his Cabinet.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Obama passed over black candidates in selecting Cabinet nominees for positions central to setting policy for urban America, such as the departments of Education, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p>Hispanic Americans, by contrast, have been nominated for three Cabinet positions, and politicians from that constituency have hailed Obama&rsquo;s nominations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the African-American community probably expect more appointees at that level? Probably so,&#8221; said Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), an early Obama supporter who has expressed an interest in filling Obama&rsquo;s vacant Senate seat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;On balance, I&rsquo;d say a great deal of thought went into the shaping of this Cabinet,&#8221; Davis told The Hill. &#8220;And he ended up with a real rainbow. But some people, sure, thought there should be a bit more color in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another senior member of the CBC who requested anonymity said more pointedly that Obama &#8220;isn&rsquo;t doing enough for the black folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet, if confirmed, will include 11 whites, four blacks, three Hispanics and two Asian Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s final Cabinet announcements last week raised frustrations within the CBC that Obama is taking his strongest supporters for granted, an aide to a prominent black lawmaker said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama also announced African-American Ron Kirk, the former mayor of Dallas, would be his trade representative. But Kirk only won the post after a Hispanic, Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), turned it down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People I&rsquo;ve talked to have expressed that they were hoping to have seen a few more African-Americans in place, and in places where you can pinpoint needs,&#8221; Davis said, citing specifically the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p>Those three departments are going to be run by white men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And, notably, unlike the CBC, Hispanic lawmakers were happy not only to have familiar faces in the Cabinet, but to see them placed in key positions to advance some of their highest priorities, such as comprehensive immigration reform.</p>
<p>In fact, many Hispanics in Congress are buoyed by the possibility of getting immigration reform moved back onto the front burner, especially with Solis at the Labor Department and Bill Richardson running the Commerce Department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ninety-five percent of African-American voters supported Obama, 8 percent more than voted for Democratic Sen. John Kerry (Mass.) in 2004. Turnout of African-Americans was key to helping Obama win Virginia and North Carolina, which had gone for the GOP presidential candidate for decades.</p>
<p>But Hispanics might have been even more important to Obama. He took 67 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to exit polls, compared to the 53 percent won by Kerry. Obama won Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, which all went Republican in 2004.<br>

		<p>If Whites would vote as a single block, we may be able to take back our country.</p>
<p>Blacks have very unrealistic expectations about what Obama will be able to deliver.  In the end, they will blame it all on Whitey, and take out their frustrations by rioting.</p>

		<p> Proof positive, as if we needed any, that many blacks are never grateful no matter what is done for them, and that they&rsquo;re never, ever, satisfied. Brown vs. Board of Education wasn&rsquo;t enough. The Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965 weren&rsquo;t enough. Affirmative Action wasn&rsquo;t enough. Racial gerrymandering of congressional districts wasn&rsquo;t enough. Special government giveaways to black farmers (on what I consider specious grounds) wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p> Now we have a (half-) black president, he has appointed four blacks to a 20-person cabinet (one-fifth of the cabinet officers, vs. blacks&rsquo; 13 percent of the population), and, lo and behold, that isn&rsquo;t enough either! </p>

		<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure that these types of contraversies aren&rsquo;t manufactured to try and diminish White opposition to Obama. Take the contraversy surrounding Pastor Rick Warren for example. Obama knew that using him would enfuriate homosexuals, which is exactly why I think he picked him. The Gays &amp; Lesbians get all fired up against a prominent preacher who openly speaks out against homosexuals, then White Evangelicals get all fired up in support of that preacher, and Obama ends up looking good to Middle America for picking him and standing up to Homosexuals, at least that&rsquo;s the assumption. I think that Rick Warren will be hurt more by this choice than Obama will be helped. </p>
<p>My second point is this. If Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet will have twenty appointees, and Blacks will fill four of those positions, that means that Blacks will make up twenty percent of Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet, far exceeding their percentage of the population. (Roughly around 12.5%) This should be a message to all Whites that Blacks are not merely interested in being represented fairly, they want as much control as they can get. Whites who make up over sixty percent of the population only make up fifty five percent of Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet. Hispanics who make up thirteen percent of the population will make up fifteen percent of this cabinet, and Asians who make up less than ten percent will make up ten percent of the cabinet. It&rsquo;s obvious from these numbers that only one group is under-represented in Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet, and it&rsquo;s Whites.</p>
<p>As I first mentioned, I seriously suspect that these contraversies are manufactured. I think we can expect to see many more like them throughout the coming administration. I just hope that Whites can see past the lies. Obama will continue to pay lip service to Whites, but act in the interest of minorities behind the scenes. It is of vital importance that we keep our guard up during this administration. Obama has already proven himself to be a master of propaguanda, so we have to be especially vigilent, and we have to expose the lies wherever and whenever they appear.</p>

		<p>It is obvious that whites are underrepresented.  Non-Hispanic whites make up between 70-80% of population and have only 55% of cabinet seats.  Blacks are 10-12% of population but 20% of cabinet.   </p>

<p>So whites are underrepresented and blacks overrepresented, when compared to the population at large.  But apparently that&rsquo;s still not good enough&hellip;</p>

		<p>Because Obama has been around elite Whites for years, he is smart enough to know his own limitations.</p>
<p>He is not a Sharpton or Jackson, who both believe their own rantings. </p>
<p>Obama may not be smart enough to know how many states are in the Union, but he is smart enough to know that appointing blacks to all the leadership positions in the United States will only create another Detroit or Zimbabwe/Congo. </p>
<p>He knows, better tokenism for blacks, rather than the complete collapse/destruction of the United States.  </p>

		<p>Blacks continue to see Obama as one of them. He&rsquo;s not. He&rsquo;s only half black, was not raised in the U.S. and experienced nothing blacks in the U.S. do. Obama is an eliteist and I&rsquo;d be surprised if he felt any real emphathy with blacks. He&rsquo; lived a life of priveledge. He&rsquo;s used his color to get where he is and he&rsquo;s smart enough to know there is a limit to what he can do for blacks. He&rsquo;s not going to be the black &#8220;Messiah&#8221; blacks expect. He&rsquo;ll do what&rsquo;s best for Obama, just wait and see.</p>

		<p>Never fear, CBC.  Those 11 white cabinet members will be working overtime in the best interests of blacks and other minorities at the expense of whites, just as every other white politician has done since the 1960&rsquo;s, regardless of political party affiliation.  Whites in the general population will not see any benefits from having these white politicians in Obama&rsquo;s cabinet, so your personal and political desires of seeing the white man &#8216;get his&rsquo; is still right on schedule.</p>

<p>I agree.  It&rsquo;s only going to make them complain even more Robert.  The more power they have the more they&rsquo;ll attempt to take advantage of us.  Imagine, Obama appointed 4 Blacks, that&rsquo;s 20% of his appointments when Blacks are about 13% of the population.  Eleven Whites equals 55%, so Whites are underrepresented.  Not enough.  Got to have all Black faces to stick it to Whitey.  But you know, if Obama gets reelected that&rsquo;s when he&rsquo;s gonna really start actin&rsquo; Black.  Give him a chance folks.  He wants to get reelected and might not be able to do that if really sticks it us  Crackers in his first term.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just great that he has picked Hispanics for three of the positions in his Cabinet. It&rsquo;s amazing that so few whites are able to see that not only do we have a black president, but we also have a very colored Cabinet along with it.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;d like to correct kindly some of the above posters. Only nine of twenty (45%) Cabinet members are white: Robert Gates, Janet Napolitano, Tom Daschle, Arne Duncan, Tom Vilsack, Timothy F. Geithner, Hillary Clinton, Shaun Donovan, and Lisa P. Jackson. Rahm Emanuel and Peter R. Orszag are Jewish.</p>
<p>So, in actuality, only six of the twenty (30%) are white MEN. There was a recent time when 100% of a President&rsquo;s Cabinet would be WHITE MEN. Now, it&rsquo;s down to 30%. If that&rsquo;s not disenfranchisement, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>

		<p>      Putting all Blacks in the Cabinet would take away from<br>
what He has to do in the Middle East and here at home. If you <br>
take money from people, you have to do what they say-you&rsquo;re an<br>
employee. Obama took money, lots of it, from Goldman-Sachs and<br>
George Soros and now he has to serve them-and those whom they<br>
serve. Rom Emmanual is there as the overseer. Blacks have been<br>
duped just as much as Whites. Obama is a house boy-nothing more.<br>
If does a good job they may throw him a bone and let him give<br>
more money to Kenya or something. But it will be our money, not<br>
their&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Posters who are looking for the future cracks in the Obama admin can dream on. Black leaders are held to vastly lower standards than white leaders. If a white leader had ruined his country like Mugabe did do you think liberals would still be sending aid there? Most probably all the levers of international power would have removed such a white leader from office much earlier. But black leaders are given enormous leeway. The MSM is in collusion with liberals, international organizations and churches to protect black leaders from their mistakes. They have to succeed no matter how outrageous their behavior because the liberal establishment ultimately hinges on their &#8220;success&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Whites have such short memories to think Obama is not a radical black. Remember Rev Wright? Remember the 20 long years of white hating terrorist extreme radicalist Black Muslim Black Panther  indoctrination Barry was trained with along with all the rest the members typical of Chicagism tactics? </p>
<p>If Obama stayed in his church 20 yrs this mean he was 26 yrs old when he became a member and left at age 46 right in time for his election political maneuvering damage control to get those millions of white votes that he needed to win and without he wouldnt have lost. </p>
<p>We know that according the messiah black jesus lies he never ever once heard any of the white hate sermons although he allowed his wife and 2 young girls to be subjected to this racism that was far worse than any others like David Duke or George Wallace to name a few.</p>
<p>Obama had the big head so badly he had to go on primetime national tv to allegedly cut ties with Rev Wright and lie about never having heard his racist white hating rants, and in the process we saw tears stream down white faces as the media touted the greatness of the speech yada yada yadda. What a crock of hock.</p>
<p>We know it was a rig and Rev Wright knew it was something that had to be done. Blacks always cover each others backs.</p>
<p>We still havent heard anyone ask Obama what his thoughts were on the OJ trial where 2 whites got their heads cut off and an all black jury acquitted Simpson to a 100% collective rejoicing by blacks while most all whites were on the opposite side. </p>
<p>The fact is Obamas 20 yrs of terror racist training will always be with him and look for Rev Wright to be a many WH functions. Obama is a part of the black family and a hero to all of them.</p>

<p>Mongoloid IQ is bifurcated.  They have fantastic math/visuo-spatial scores but their verbal IQ is around 100.  Since politicians are lawyers, they don&rsquo;t have an IQ advantage.  And probably the most influential factor is a total lack of interest.  Asians have the lowest voting rates.  Basically expect more Asian architects rather than politicians.  </p>

		<p>Obama doesn&rsquo;t have to appease the Blacks to retain their approval. He has it automatically and almost unconditionally.<br>
Four out of twenty positions is 20%, almost TWICE their representation in the population. I am certain Obama got good advice from the initial White entourage that surrounded him that it would not be a good idea to appoint many Blacks to high positions. They have a high degree of corruption and any scandals could damage his first term. In addition, he knows that Blacks - when left to their own devices - usually don&rsquo;t work together well and many times self-destruct, something he can not afford to happen on his watch.</p>

<p>This morning, I saw a film clip of Obama in Hawaii going outdoors for one reason or another, surrounded by Secret Service people.  But the kicker is that he had on a baggy white tee shirt and a baseball cap - on backwards.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this guy really knows what being the president actually means.  I have a feeling that he will wake up one night, some time into his presidency, and suddenly realize the mess he has created for himself.</p>

		<p>Did anyone see the press conference attending Bill Richardson&rsquo;s appointment as Secretary of Commerce? A thickly accented member of the &#8216;hispanic&rsquo; press accused Obama in hostile tones of tossing the Latino community a &#8216;consolation prize&rsquo; instead of appointing Richardson as Secretary of State. Obama replied &#8216;You haven&rsquo;t seen the totality of my appointments yet&hellip;&rsquo; This can only get more interesting, re the black/hispanic divide.</p>

		<p>Since  approximately 10% of the so-called  Hispanic  population  is  black  and  there  is  some  question whether non-African American  blacks are  counted  as &#8220;African American&#8221;,  the  black  U.S.  population  should  be  approximately 15-16% not  12%  as  commonly  cited.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re lucky he didn&rsquo;t appoint the entire Chicago machine to Washington.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still time, and I predict that within 6 months the white appointees will begin to resign for &#8220;personal reasons&#8221; at which time the black/muslim appointments will begin.</p>

		<p>Personally I believe that whites need to organize a NAAWP to whine about and protect our own interests. Of course if we do we will be called racists. </p>

		<p>&#8221; I&rsquo;d like to correct some of the above posters. Only nine of twenty (45%) Cabinet members are white: Robert Gates, Janet Napolitano, Tom Daschle, Arne Duncan, Tom Vilsack, Timothy F. Geithner, Hillary Clinton, Shaun Donovan, and Lisa P. Jackson. Rahm Emanuel and Peter R. Orszag are Jewish.<br>

Lisa Jackson is white?  Don&rsquo;t be too quick to make assumptions.  She is described by Wikipedia thus:</p>
<p> <i>She is the first African American and first African American woman to serve as Chief of Staff to the Governor of New Jersey. On December 15, 2008, President-Elect Barack Obama officially designated Jackson as the nominee for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.If confirmed she&rsquo;ll be the first African American to serve as EPA Administrator, along with being the fourth woman and second New Jerseyan to hold the position.  </i></p>
<p>PS. I must admit (judging from the photographs I&rsquo;ve seen) that you&rsquo;d have to TELL me that she&rsquo;s  &#8220;black&#8221;.   Otherwise, I&rsquo;d never have guessed.   But what matters is what she is in her own head. There are some others also who are of questionable identity. The number of whites is even fewer than you thought.</p>
