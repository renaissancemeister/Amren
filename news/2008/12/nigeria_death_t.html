			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ahmed Saka, AP, November 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mobs burned homes, churches and mosques Saturday in a second day of riots, as the death toll rose to more than 300 in the worst sectarian violence in Africa&rsquo;s most populous nation in years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jos, the capital of Plateau State, has a long history of community violence that has made it difficult to organize voting. Rioting in September 2001 killed more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fighting began as clashes between supporters of the region&rsquo;s two main political parties after the first local election in the town of Jos in more than a decade. But the violence expanded along ethnic and religious fault lines, with Hausas [Muslims] and members of Christian ethnic groups doing battle.</p>
<p>Angry mobs gathered Thursday in Jos after electoral workers failed to publicly post results in ballot collation centers, prompting many onlookers to assume the vote was the latest in a long line of fraudulent Nigerian elections.</p>
<p>Riots flared Friday morning, and at least 15 people were killed. Local ethnic and religious leaders made radio appeals for calm on Saturday, and streets were mostly empty by early afternoon. Troops were given orders to shoot rioters on sight.<br>

		<p>As the USA becomes more and more diverse, we can expect to see this kind of behavior here. If an election doesn&rsquo;t turn out the way unethical white Americans like it(ie Al Franken), they protest by running the election boards and election rules through the ringer.  When an election doesn&rsquo;t turn out the way blacks and browns like it, they take it the streets. I&rsquo;m sad to affirm we have left this future to our kids.</p>

		<p>Tens of thousands of Nigerians are coming to America each month.  Wait until these killings begin here in our towns.  The police will just look the other way because no cop is going to want to be responsible for shooting a BLACK no matter what he does or where he comes from.  The WHITE SUICIDE begins.</p>

Clearly they&rsquo;re not trying hard enough.</p>
<p>All they need Affirmative Action Laws, inclusion, a coalition government, and mandated courses on diversity and tolerance. Throw in a few hate crimes laws and they should be fine.</p>

		<p>Quite frankly the western African state of Nigeria is a disaster waiting to happen.If it doesn&rsquo;t blow-up big-time in our lifetimes, it most certainly will in the future.<br>
Unfortunately, Nigera&rsquo;s teeming population has some proximity to Europe and the factors causing mass Nigerian emigration will only intensify in the future.This is something that European leaders must heed (but of course they will not).<br>
 If I state that most of America&rsquo;s blacks are ultimately of Nigerian providence, I feel that I have proved my case.<br>
  On another note, this terrible story, that happened over last weekend, in terms of loss of life was the most important global news story.But it was hardly reported by mainstream US or European media (apart from the Mumbai incident they love their &#8216;celebrity&rsquo; trivia).<br>
 Why?</p>

		<p>When do they find the time to fight?  I thought Nigerians spent most of their time emailing Americans for help getting money out of that special account.  These riots are also going to curtail the tourist kidnapping trade.  Then again if the Nigerians want to kill each other there will be fewer on Bush&rsquo;s African dole.</p>

<p>NO, you are not. America screwed up badly (one of many I&rsquo;m sad to say) by taking the side of the muslims in Kosovo and against the Serbs. Perhaps we should heed lessons here and very heavily arm the Christians there in Nigeria and Niger. In fact let&rsquo;s go and very heavily arm and suport all Christians even though I am not a religious man (at all) I recognize bad things when I see them.</p>

		<p>Nothing new here, this has been going on since the British left.<br>
Remember Biafra. For the last 600 years the Muslims have been moving south. This has nothing to do with diversity, the Muslims, who are slightly in the minority lost the elections and they react as only Muslims do, with murder and mayhem, just  like in Kenya last year. The same would have happened in the US had Obama lost.</p>

		<p>  Nigeria has a massive population explosion, a country divided roughly in half in a Christian South and an Muslim North, ultra religious population (killing witches in the South, sharia in the North)  and a desertification that is pushing the Muslim northern population into the Christian South . This riots are merely sparks. When Nigeria pops it&rsquo;s going to make Sudan,Congo and Rwanda look like schoolyard brawls. </p>

		<p>These are just the sort of people the US government likes to import as refugee&rsquo;s.   There are some towns in the Mid West that could use a little more diversity and cultural enrichment. </p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be delightful poetic justice for the left if, after bashing Bush for years for getting us into the quagmire in Iraq, Obama got us into another one in Nigeria?</p>
<p>Those who are saying this election was &#8220;the end&#8221; for the GOP should wait and see what kind of a mess Obama gets us into.</p>

		<p>&hellip;At the same time their brethren are rioting here at a Walmart on Long Island.  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s all caused by poverty, racism, and the lack of education.  As a White man, I take full responsibility for all Black anti-social behavior.  If it weren&rsquo;t for me, none of this would ever happen.</p>

		<p>To Kenelm Digby:</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal here, really? It&rsquo;s Africans being Africans. The Crips Nigeria against the Bloods Nigeria. The loss of life is higher than what happened in Bombay, India; but, because the Indian episode involved terrorists, and the Nigerian episode didn&rsquo;t, it got short shrift.</p>
<p>Kenelm, if Joan Baez had traveled to Nigeria and gotten the Muslims and Christians to join hands and sing &#8220;Kumbaya&#8221; while she strummed on a guitar, THAT would have been newsworthy. </p>

		<p>I watched a  movie last night, titled &#8220;Shooting Dogs&#8221; about the Rwanda &#8216;genocide&rsquo; stuff, truly uplifting at the end as the HooToos finaly get into the compound (after the whites leave) and use machetes to slaughtwer the TooTsies:) If anyone keeps track, this occurs about every 15 years one the male population is replenished with the help of U.N. food deliveries and medical services.</p>
