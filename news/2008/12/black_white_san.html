<h1>Black, White Santas Draw Some Criticism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Paras, Post and Courier (Charleston), December 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Students at St. Stephen Elementary School found out last week that Santa Claus can have the same skin color as them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because two Santa Clauses &mdash; one white, one black &mdash; were invited to the rural Berkeley County school at separate times last Friday to take pictures with students of the same skin color.</p>
<p>Principal Willa Norton&rsquo;s decision to invite two Santas has drawn criticism from a few parents and from two civil rights organizations, which said the school shouldn&rsquo;t have divided the students by race without asking parents first.</p>
<p>Marguerite Lyons, who found out about the two Santas while picking up her son outside the school Thursday, said dividing the children by race smacked of prejudice. All the children should have seen one Santa, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Norton said everything was done to benefit a student population that is predominantly black and from low-income families. More than 97 percent qualify for free or reduced lunch, and 75 percent are black.</p>
<p>She said most of the children probably wouldn&rsquo;t have a chance to meet Santa otherwise, and she wanted to use the opportunity to let students know that the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said she even tried to find a Hispanic Santa for the handful of Hispanic children and an Asian Santa Claus for the school&rsquo;s one Asian child.</p>
<p>Parent Jay Paulin, who is black, said he liked that his daughter and the other children could talk and take pictures with a black Santa.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows (Santa) can look like them too,&#8221; Paulin said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dot Scott, president of the Charleston chapter of the NAACP, praised the principal&rsquo;s effort but found flaws in the execution.</p>
<p>Scott, who successfully rallied for a black Santa in the Charleston Christmas parade, said that if there is going to be more than one Santa, the parents should have a choice.</p>
<p>She said even some black children, who have been taught all of their lives by television that Santa is white, may have had a problem with going to a black Santa.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise you, had you told the parents, you would have had some black parents take their kids to see a white Santa, but not one white parent would have taken their child to see a black Santa,&#8221; Scott said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Victoria Middleton, executive director of American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina, said the school might have had the best intentions but, &#8220;We would question whether separating the children by race was really a good idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>This means that they can be President if the President looks like then, so they can also be Santa Claus.  The one big hurdle is that the real life St. Nicholas represented altriusm, a trait which is lacking among blacks.  And he was white, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter to them, because we&rsquo;re now to believe that Cleopatra was black.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the facts. </p>
<p>If they send a White Santa (is there any other kind?) to the take pictures with the kiddies, some will complain that Santa Claus represents institutional racism. If they send a Black Santa for the Black kids, some will complain that it represents institutional racism.</p>
<p>The best and only answer is for Blacks to live in Africa, Asians to live in Asia, Hispanics to live in Latin America, and Whites to live in North America and Europe. Why is this concept so difficult to comprehend?</p>
<p>Oh, wait a minute. I forgot. It&rsquo;s because there is money to be made by a very small group of Whites buttering the bread on both sides and sending the bill to White taxpayers.<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see, little black children must see a black Santa so they know that Santa looks like them, but little white children must see a black Santa so the Diversity brainwashing can continue without a hiccup. This has gone past a joke and into the realm of the insane. </p>

<p>Did Comrade Norton also look for a Hanukkah Harry too? I mean he clearly exists, just watch:</p>

		<p>What a total absurdity. Everyone with half a brain knows that Santa is White. After all, everything about Christmas originated in White countries. They ought to go see a Kwanzaa Santa if they don&rsquo;t like Kris Kringle. As for the Asians, maybe they ought to invent their own Kwanzaa type holiday.</p>

		<p>Let me get this right, blacks have separate organizations for EVERYTHING [black congress,black schools, black lawyers, black police unions etc.] but yet having a black santa &#8220;smacked of prejudice.&#8221; These &#8220;people&#8221; are truly twisted. I smell a &#8220;ghetto lottery&#8221; in the making. Anyway, everyone knows that Santa is White because blacks don&rsquo;t GIVE anything to ANYBODY so how could he be black? I do agree with Dot Scott though, I would NEVER take a kid of mine to see a black Santa!!!</p>

		<p>This is a conundrum being faced across the Western world. Ethnic interests can not decide whether they want separation or inclusion with whites.</p>
<p>They are not motivated by principles.  They will flip-flop to the option that gives the best return.  </p>

		<p>This just emphasizes the fact that all races want icons that look like them, including religious ones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a natural desire inculcated within all of us by mother nature, just as tribal loyalty and a desire to be around one&rsquo;s own &#8220;people&#8221; is a perfectly natural human trait.</p>
<p>It is only the lefties who refuse to allow people to do whatever their human instincts tell them to do, because they have some kind of mental disorder that makes them want to see all different kinds of people somehow noticing that there are no differences in races.</p>
<p>A rainbow utopia is their goal even if they have to drag everybody together kicking and screaming, protesting that they want to be with their own kind.</p>
<p>I mean, they just feel sooo good thinking about the whole ideological affair.</p>

		<p>Since the historical antecedent to Santa Claus was St. Nicholas, who was white, and since the popular image of Santa was created by Thomas Nast, who was also white, how is it wrong for whites to think of Santa as being white, and to want to avoid confusing the kids with multiple Santa characters (multiple drinking fountains)? </p>
<p>If blacks want a black holiday character, let them create one of their own (Father Kwanzaa?).</p>

		<p>I insist on a White kwanzaa claus!  For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, kwanzaa claus gives little black kids presents.  He doesn&rsquo;t have &#8220;little people&#8221; make the gifts at a secret location in the snow, he just steals them from Whites.</p>
<p>I heard the Chinese Santa was cool.  The children all sat at his feet, and he took down all their requests on a laptop.  One poor young boy said he needed a kidney transplant, so Santa had a politcal prisoner shot, and his kidney delivered the very next day.  </p>

		<p>When I was a child, and this country was still White, we went to the department store every year to see Santa and tell him what he wanted for Christmas and get my picture  taken with him.  If I had gotten to the front of the line and seen a Black Santa sitting there, I would have run out of the store in fear.  And no amount of diversity training could have convinced me to go back and sit on his lap.</p>

<p>They can celebrate both. And we should be respectful and afraid of their celebration either way. I think it&rsquo;s called having it both ways. Having it everyway. </p>

		<p>Santa Claus is an icon of white Germanic heritage. Even though a fairy tale figure, he is still an emblem of that heritage. If we were to take an African figure from mythology (is there one that they could even agree upon) then rest assured we would be accused of stealing their heritage. </p>

I was just listening to local black radio and the host was complaining about white Santas in the black community. He said &#8216;there&rsquo;s a purpose behind it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The purpose? To send black kids the message that only whites can be kind and giving.</p>
<p>Here I thought Santa Claus was a European creation and tradition and it only seems natural that Europeans would see their creation and tradition as white.</p>
<p>I stand corrected.<br>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t everybody know that St. Nicholas was white?  <br>
As for Kwanzaa, not even blacks should bother with it, since it is a fake holiday recently created by an FBI stooge, claiming a west African heritage and using east African language for a veneer of authenticity, even though the words all echo the principles of Marxism (whoops, another white European!)- but then, let them get up to whatever foolishness they please.  <br>
Just let them do it in Africa, and let whites of European heritage celebrate their history and culture without interference!</p>

		<p>Events like this which are endemic in our PC society are further proof, as if any were needed, that Cultural Marxism/political correctness is a template for the destruction of every white-majority nation-state and Western civilisation as a whole. That the Marxists have completed their &#8216;long march through the institutions&rsquo; is blindingly obvious from observing the naive, gullible dupes masquerading as university graduates that Western universities now churn out. People of European descent have to wake up now and take responsibility for their futures instead of being duped by the NWO globalist elite. </p>
<p>Typical of the educational brainwashing is the &#8216;climate change is man-made&rsquo; scam that denies evidence like that in the short link below where 32,000 scientists in USA alone attest that climate change has been around for billions of years and is a naturally occurring phenomena. Green is the new Red. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the change in color. This man-made climate change is just the latest NWO scam to further their One-World government agenda. After all, a population threatened by environmental disaster is much more likely to buckle down and do the bidding of its political elites.</p>

<p>Like that old song, &#8220;you can&rsquo;t have one, without the &hellip;.other!&#8221;</p>
<p>St. Nicholas was a real man, a Bishop of the Church, and attended the First Ecumenical Council in 325 A.D., which gave us the Nicene Creed. He was so disgusted at the prototype of all heresy and error, the person Arius, that he went up in council and slapped his face!</p>
<p>This normally renders a Bishop a layman, but the Hierarchs all believed that an Antichrist deserves to be struck&hellip; with a hand&hellip;. or even a shoe!</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, and give us back Manly White Men again, like St. Nick, to lead Europe&rsquo;s sons and daughters&rsquo; out of this Antichrist Dark Empire&hellip; in more ways than one. And all Europe&rsquo;s people, said: &#8216;Ah-men.&rsquo; (not &#8216;ayyyy-men&rsquo;- Latin has no sound like that!)</p>
