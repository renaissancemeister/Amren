<h1>AJC Investigation: Many Athletes Lag Far Behind on SAT Scores</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Knobler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, December 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Football and men&rsquo;s basketball players on the nation&rsquo;s big-time college teams averaged hundreds of points lower on their SATs than their classmates, and some of the gaps are so large they call into question the lengths to which schools will go to win.</p>
<p>The biggest gap between football players and students as a whole occurred at the University of Florida, where players scored 346 points lower than the school&rsquo;s overall student body. That&rsquo;s larger than the difference in scores between typical students at the University of Georgia and Harvard University.</p>
<p>Nationwide, football players average 220 points lower on the SAT than their classmates &mdash; and men&rsquo;s basketball players average seven points less than football players.</p>
<p>Those figures come from an Atlanta Journal-Constitution study of 54 public universities, including the members of the six major Bowl Championship Series conferences and other schools whose teams finished the 2007-08 season ranked among the football or men&rsquo;s basketball top 25.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationwide, coaches who would never offer a scholarship to a player who was 6 inches shorter or half a second slower than other prospects routinely recruit players whose standardized test scores suggest they&rsquo;re at a competitive disadvantage in the classroom.</p>
<p><b>It&rsquo;s the price of winning.</b></p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re going to mount a competitive program in Division I-A, and our institution is committed to do that, some flexibility in admissions of athletes is going to take place,&#8221; said Tom Lifka, chairman of the committee that handles athlete admissions at the University of California, Los Angeles. &#8220;Every institution I know in the country operates in the same way. It may or may not be a good thing, but that&rsquo;s the way it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCLA, which has won more NCAA championships in all sports than any other school, had the biggest gap between the average SAT scores of athletes in all sports and its overall student body, at 247 points.</p>
<p>Administrators such as Lifka say the SAT gap between athletes and non-athletes is the price of fielding a team, and they argue what&rsquo;s important is that large numbers of their scholarship athletes earn degrees. Critics say athletes who arrive on campus unprepared to compete academically get shuffled off to easy majors and unchallenging courses and don&rsquo;t receive much of an education.</p>
<p><b>Questions about fairness</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Who gets hurt? Former Princeton University President William Bowen points to the students the colleges would have admitted if they hadn&rsquo;t enrolled less qualified athletes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are grounds for concern,&#8221; Bowen said. &#8220;Places at a lot of these schools are precious things. To have them allocated this way raises troubling questions about fairness, about taking advantage of educational opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Georgia Tech men&rsquo;s basketball coach Paul Hewitt says he and other coaches are able to go beyond test scores to find recruits who can succeed in school while also having the talent to play at a high level.</p>
<p>Hewitt says the only fair comparison is between athletes and other students with similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Seen that way, he argues, athletics programs perform very well. Black athletes, for example, graduate at higher rates than black students as a whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;To insinuate that athletics has caused this problem of poor graduation rates [among black students] is wrong,&#8221; Hewitt said.</p>
<p>The Journal-Constitution obtained the test scores and other academic data from reports each major college athletics department is required to file with the NCAA, college sports&rsquo; governing body. The NCAA considers the reports confidential; the Journal-Constitution obtained them under state public record laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The differences in the age of the data make comparisons among the schools imperfect, but there are two reasons to think they&rsquo;re still noteworthy. First, there&rsquo;s little difference on average between the figures for the schools with the oldest data and those with the newest. Second, each school reported figures for three consecutive freshman classes, and the average change in the football team&rsquo;s SAT scores was less than three points between a school&rsquo;s oldest class and its most recent. Twenty-seven schools improved their average football SAT; 26 didn&rsquo;t. Also, regardless of the differences between individual schools, some universal truths emerged:</p>
<p>o All 53 schools for which football SAT scores were available had at least an 88-point gap between team members&rsquo; average score and the average for the student body.</p>
<p>o Schools with the highest admissions standards, such as Georgia Tech; the University of Virginia; the University of California, Berkeley; UCLA; and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, had the biggest gaps between the SAT averages for athletes and the overall student body.</p>
<p>o Football players performed 115 points worse on the SAT than male athletes in other sports.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>o Many schools routinely used a special admissions process to admit athletes who did not meet the normal entrance requirements. More than half of scholarship athletes at the University of Georgia, the University of Wisconsin, Clemson University, UCLA, Rutgers University, Texas A&M University and Louisiana State University were special admits.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the university says they&rsquo;d help us meet team needs, that&rsquo;s as important as finding an oboist for the orchestra,&#8221; said Nancy McDuff, the University of Georgia&rsquo;s associate vice president for admissions and enrollment management.</p>
<p><b>Special admissions</b></p>
<p>The numbers, however, show special admissions exceptions are used far more often for athletes than oboists. At Georgia, for instance, 73.5 percent of athletes were special admits compared with 6.6 percent of the student body as a whole.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even Sperber, a critic of the college athletics system, says the test scores in the Journal-Constitution study should not feed a dumb jock stereotype. Instead, he said, the scores reflect the students&rsquo; background and their focus on sports over academics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NCAA President Myles Brand said the big question isn&rsquo;t whether athletes are as qualified as other students when they enroll but whether, given help, they can obtain degrees. &#8220;What you are really looking for is whether the student-athletes who are being accepted have the capability of graduating from that institution with the academic support they have available,&#8221; Brand said.</p>
<p><b>Schools make the call</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The decision how far to go in lowering admissions standards for athletes varies considerably from school to school. It can be a challenge to avoid a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>&#8220;We go out on the field and get beaten by people we couldn&rsquo;t admit,&#8221; said Charles Young, former president of the University of Florida and former chancellor of UCLA. &#8220;It creates strong pressures to go [to rival schools&rsquo; admissions standards], and there have to be very strong countervailing pressures to avoid going there.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;ll take just about anybody as long as we can get them through,&#8221; said Allen Sack, director of the University of New Haven&rsquo;s Institute for Sport Management and a former University of Notre Dame football player. &#8220;They&rsquo;re betting what they can do is they can get anyone through school if they get the right kind of counseling.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Black football and basketball players posing as &#8216;students&rsquo; is the biggest farce in American education. They are dumb as stones and couldn&rsquo;t compete intellectually with most white seventh graders. What really caught my eye was this quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Black athletes, for example, graduate at higher rates than black students as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holy cow!!! The non-athlete blacks are even dumber. I wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed that in a million years. But I guess how many blacks are on campus who aren&rsquo;t athletes? Students, I mean. Not street people who hang around colleges to sexually harrass and rape white coeds.</p>

This is the classic black &#8216;damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t, lose-lose&rsquo; proposition.</p>
<p>IF you force blacks to achieve academically in order to play sports, you&rsquo;re depriving them of becoming well-paid professional athletes. IF you allow blacks to slide academically and their professional careers are never realized you&rsquo;re depriving them of the academic skills and credentials they need to chose another career.</p>
<p>As I always say, when dealing with blacks, you can&rsquo;t win or break even.</p>

<p>Just think of how far behind they would be if their scores were not padded. &#8220;Hundreds of points&#8221; is probably a victory. Besides, they are not there to learn. They are there to facilitate the transfer of tax dollars to the school&rsquo;s corrupt White administrators and boosters&hellip; just like everything else in life.<br>

		<p>Every year, during college football championships in late Dec. and early Jan., and the basketball tourney in March, we get these stories, as if they were written once a long time ago merely with changed years.</p>
<p>TMZ did the &#8220;dumb jock&#8221; report yesterday on USC football players.  All but one they asked had no idea who Joe Biden was, but the quarterback, looks to be mostly white with a Spanish surname, knew that he had something to do with the Vice-Presidency.  I wonder which whites didn&rsquo;t get into USC so that these football players who didn&rsquo;t know about the Vice-President-Elect could get in.</p>

		<p>Sorry fellow travelers, but this one is the White man&rsquo;s fault.  Universities are a White institution, and so is the socialist takeover of their ownership and finance.  Colleges run professional scale athletic programs mostly with taxpayer dollars.  IQ and athletic ability, as far as I know, are not correlated.  Competition is fierce, so what do you expect?</p>
<p>This is just one more example of socialist distortion of an institution.  </p>

<p>Proof positive that Universities are cherry picking students by IQ and that the increase in tuition that has greatly exceeded the inflation rate is simply for feathering the nests of the faculty. Yes, the ignorant students are being unmercifully  pillaged by the institutions of higher learning.</p>

		<p>I was on the UCLA campus for years as a student then as a worker. I proctored a class that was popular with the football and basketball players. I busted a couple of black players for passing around a cheat sheet during mid-terms. The professor refused to confront the cheaters and they tried to jump me after class. They threatened me with violence and tried to run me off campus. Prof. had no balls so the miscreants were never prosecuted. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that black athletes indeed do graduate at better rates than black non-athletes. What Hewitt neglects to mention though are the resources devoted to black athletes by the athletic departments to shepherd them to a degree of some sort or another by hook or crook.  </p>
<p>What academia needs to do is just come on out and sponsor income generating professional teams for the &#8220;money sports&#8221; and be done with it. Just admit that all societies have some sort of social equivalent to gladiators. If the players want to pursue a college degree on the same academic footing as regular students, fine, if not, that&rsquo;s OK too; just obey the law and be an athlete.</p>

		<p>This article is breathtaking in its blatantly hypocritical suggestion of the &#8220;expoitation&#8221; of black athletes by the universities.  In the 1980s and early 1990s, blacks pitched a hissy-fit when the NCAA considered raising the minimum SAT scores required of freshman college athletes (which, at that time, was a laughable 700) because the rule would have had a &#8220;disproportionate impact&#8221; on blacks.  Georgetown University&rsquo;s head men&rsquo;s basketball coach, John Thompson, once famously walked off the court, in protest over the matter, apparently unaware that the NCAA-minimum SAT score was over 600 points below the average SAT score of Georgetown&rsquo;s non-athlete freshmen.  Now, 20 years later, the schools that gigged the rules to admit blacks in the first place (because it would have been racist to raise the admission standards) are now accused of expoliting black athletes because the affletes can&rsquo;t cut it in the classroom.  Dam*ed if you don&rsquo;t admit the black &#8220;student&#8221;-athlete, dam*ed if you do. Just like with mortgage lending - it&rsquo;s racist to deny a loan to a black with marginal credit, and it&rsquo;s racist to extend a loan to a black with marginal credit because he&rsquo;s not likely to be able to repay it.  </p>

<p>Ah, but the socialists do their bidding, are socialists in the first place so they can serve the black man. Each imagining they are freeing the slaves perhaps.</p>
<p>As far as IQ and athletic ability are concerned, that may be true, there is no connection between IQ and athletic ability, but I have honestly met women who have claimed there is a correlation, that cuts across racial lines, between IQ and a man&rsquo;s &#8216;prowess&rsquo; bed. That the dumb ones are more endowed in other areas. I&rsquo;ve met more than one woman who claimed that and not entirely as a joke, though it could easily be one. It&rsquo;s not exactly science. I&rsquo;d be more interested in knowing how the research was done.  </p>

		<p>   Too many of these college sports figures are coddled into thinking that they&rsquo;re uniquely privileged and above the law. I&rsquo;d love to see statistics from the NCAA indicating how many black college athletes have criminal records or are involved in crime. Unfortunately, such records will never be made available for obvious reasons. Is IQ related to crime? You bet. </p>

		<p>In Architecture school at Tulane, a while back, one of my classmates had his dorm room robbed by Black football players.  He followed the proper channels in seeking restitution.  The school did absolutely nothing.  My classmate was a brilliant kid from a poor family&hellip;there on scholarship.  He could not easily replace the stolen items.  Eventually, the black jocks were thrown off the team (and out of school), not because of the theft (or several others), but because they broke the rule about not sleeping with girls the nignt before a game.</p>
<p>At the end of that semester, my classmate switched majors and schools.  I&rsquo;m sure the school&rsquo;s reaction to the theft was a factor in his decision.</p>
<p>Big athletics programs do nothing but bring people onto campus who do not belong on campus.</p>

		<p>The article neglected to mention the largest SAT gap among the basketball teams.  According to the data from the AJC website,  it&rsquo;s at Georgia Tech, right in the newspaper&rsquo;s home town.  Among all students the average SAT score is 1344.  The men&rsquo;s basketball average is 948, a difference of 396 points.  </p>
<p>Admissions departments at most universities usually admit a freshman class in which most students (the middle 50%) are within 200 points of each other.  At Georgia Tech, the middle 50% range of scores is 1240-1420, or 180 points.  Thus, the basketball team is almost 300 points below even the 25th percentile of the entire class.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the average for the school as a whole includes both athletes and nonathletes.  Looking only at the nonathletes, their average SAT would be a little higher than 1344.</p>

		<p>Excellent article,and comments, BUT there is a down side - Where will the Phd.students get their money if they can no longer &#8220;Tutor&#8221; these basketball players.  I knew 2 of these tutors at University of Colorado, Boulder, and they were appalled at just how stupid these athletes were. That was some time ago,It appears all the headstart,affirmative action programs,were not that sucessful after all.</p>

		<p>Remember this is measuring students ability in regard to their SAT scores, which we have learned is inaccurate. I wont tell people what to think, but keep it in mind.   My score was realy low, but i knew I was smarter than my SAT indicated. My GPA was good and I was well spoken when visiting a campus and doing an interview with admissions. I was told that they look for something good in an athlete, whether it be standardized test, GPA, the high school went to.  </p>
<p>Anyway. I went to a small college, where classes are small and it was hard not to learn and participate.  At the major institutions, you need to keep in mind the entertainment value of successful athletics and both sides can win.  Even the dumbest athlete will benefit from being in an academic setting.  People really change between 18-22. I certainly become well-read and more well-spoken from being in an academic setting. I see many athletes majoring in business, which barely has anything to do with the SAT. </p>
<p>Student athletes learn a lot about networking and being around individuals different than them, even if they have a hard time learning either philosophy or physics.</p>
