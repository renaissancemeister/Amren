<h1><a href="https://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/29/europe/politicus.php?page=1">From the Left, a Call to End the Current Dutch Notion of Tolerance</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Vinocur, International Herald Tribune, December 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the country&rsquo;s biggest left-wing political grouping, the Labor Party, which has responsibility for integration as a member of the coalition government led by the Christian Democrats, issued a position paper calling for the end of the failed model of Dutch &#8220;tolerance.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not clear enough? Ploumen [Lilianne Ploumen, Labor&rsquo;s chairwoman,] insists, &#8220;The success of the integration process is hindered by the disproportionate number of non-natives involved in criminality and trouble-making, by men who refuse to shake hands with women, by burqas and separate courses for women on citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to stop the existence of parallel societies within our society.&#8221;</p>

<p><p>But you will get <b>nothing else but</b> such &#8220;parallel societies&#8221; if you continue to &#8220;tolerate&#8221; non-white, Third World immigrants and residents of Holland.

		<p>This is a big step forward for the left to demand immigrants give up their backward culture. They do not mention the other equally valid option of having the immigrants simply return to their country of origin.</p>

		<p>Someone who posted here at AR regularly who considers himself left-of-center (Robert Lindsay?) made the remark several months ago that, for the pro-white cause to be successful, it is going to have to disengage from the linear political spectrum; it would need the help of whites who consider themselves left-wing on many things.  This story might be an example of this coming to fruition.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just immigrants in Holland. The Netherlands is famous all across Europe for their &#8216;youth&rsquo; problem. Problems with white youth, such as drug addiction and promiscuity. The Netherlands is the San Francisco of Europe. Of course, this was 20 years ago and hopefully the rest of Europe has learned from example. If not, I can only imagine what it would take. </p>

<p>When Pim Fortuyn broke the conspiracy of silence and took a stand against this phenomena&hellip;he was demonized, called racist and right-wing extremist, danger to minorities and of course &#8220;Dutch Hitler&#8221;. &#8220;Eichman&#8221; and untermensch by these same hypocrites in the labor party who created the problem in the first place. Their climate of  hatred towards Pim Fortuyn ultimately led to his assissination. Now they play the mind-game because they want to win the upcoming elections&hellip;.but they don&rsquo;t fool me. These socialist are the root problem in the Netherlands they need to go&hellip;enough is enough with these reds!</p>

   Theo Van Gogh and Purnth were killed by moslems not prostitudes or hashish smokers.</p>

		<p>All of this sounds promising. But I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing that the comment thread which accompanies the original article, while overwhelmingly in agreement with the anti-immigration sentiment, was also overwhelmingly non-Dutch. Mostly Americans, actually. </p>
<p>One of the few Dutch posters I came across had this to say:</p>
<p><i>May I just add that there are many in the Netherlands, such as myself, who feel that the Dutch notion of tolerance is wonderful? While there certainly are problems with immigration, I believe we can solve many of those by adopting a stance similar to that in the US: please retain your own culture when you immigrate into the United States.</i></p>

<p>You clearly do not know Kuwaiti or Saudi muslim MEN!!! they are the most sexually degenerate of any nationality/religion I have ever met. They have a particular taste for pre-op transexuals and young boys. I know these people, been among them socially and professionally and I dislike them intensly.</p>

		<p>As flying tiger points out, I would think that the slaughter of Theo Van Gogh as well Purnth in the middle of Hollands streets, might be some cause for alarm, but apparently not enough. Rational citizens can only watch and shake their heads at the kind of leadership they have. However, it is a reflection of the citizenries own apathy and indifference.</p>

You are quite right about Muslims, Slip.  He is flaunting his ignorance,  but he clearly does not know much about <i>anything! &hellip;</i>(including Dutch homosexuals, who do not &#8220;mince in the public arena&#8221;).<br>

This sadly confused Dutchman obviously does not know much about anything either   &mdash;    certainly not about immigration or the United States.  </p>
<p>The notion he expresses above, thinking that is U.S. policy,  is actually something quite new to America (and not working very well).  The historical expectation of the USA towards its immigrants  (which did work well) was formerly quite different:  Assimilate!   Of course, that also applied to persons of similar race and culture   &mdash;    who were ABLE to assimilate.</p>

		<p>Sure it&rsquo;s a little interesting to see some on the left start to shift position but the truth is, &#8220;It is too late&#8221;.</p>
<p>Once you bring in enough of these immigrants to start their own sub-societies &hellip; how do you back-up?</p>
<p>It would take actions which very few of the Polite folks from the Netherlands are capable of.</p>
<p>This lesson is unfolding all across Europe, though many will try to ride it out&hellip; hoping for success, as they have no other choice.</p>
<p>The ironic thing in all of this is; the multitudes of stories about how bad Russia and Putin are for not embracing this form of national suicide.<br>

		<p>All well and good, but are they &#8220;Sarkozy-style&#8221; fed up with Muslims (ie. say what the people want to get elected, then backpedal once in office), or genuine? My money is on the former until I am proven otherwise. We&rsquo;ve been tricked like this far too many times to count.</p>

<p>Thank you&hellip;.there is a form of multicultural brainwashing taking place in the Netherlands: There is no God but the government like it or not.</p>
<p>*America is the no 1 bogeyman on the face of the planet and dangerous for minorities because their is no wellfare system.</p>
<p>*The Netherlands is the best place on earth especially for minorites because the government takes care of you from the craddle to the grave.</p>

I became persona non grata and was labeled crazy because I dymantled the myth. Before I left in 1999 I said it many times that things were going to hit the fan and sadly enough it manifested itself in the murder of Pim Fortuyn and Theo Gogh. <br>
If the elite is proclaiming that Muslims are the future of the Netherlands you know what time it is. This &ldquo;We have to stop the existence of parallel societies within our society.&rdquo; is a sham from the PVDA socialist to fool the electorate, if somebody else had said this they would be branded as dangerous extreme rightwingers. A muslim member of the PVDA is becoming Mayor in the city that Pim Fortuyn called home before he was killed and that tells me enough.</p>

		<p>I think that the Dutch, having proven themselves unfit for self-government, ought be rounded up and shipped to South Africa.  Tell them that they&rsquo;re being given a boat ride by the mommy state, and the children of all ages will walk right up the gangplank. The Blacks can be driven out, back to central Africa, and the new servile, laboring class will be given two weeks to assimilate to the culture of the Boers.  This may seem harsh, but nations, like individuals, that refuse to grow up and take adult responsibilities, need to be institutionalized or cast out.  <br>
     The depopulated country can be given to those few Netherlanders and Scandinavians who have enough self respect to oppose non-European immigration to their countries.  The rest of the pitiable descendants of the Norsemen can be used to populate Siberia, once Russia has taken their land from the spoiled brats.  Europe is long overdue for an ethnic restructuring, a purge of those rotting cultures whose response to invasion is to offer their throats to the primitive hordes.  </p>

Well said! And that &#8220;decadence and moral rot&#8221; serves as a distraction from the REAL problems that afflict them, and which they&rsquo;re forbidden to address. Contrary to the propaganda,there is little real freedom in the Netherlands   &mdash;   except the freedom to destroy yourself. To do that is perfectly fine with those in charge. Dutch national self-destruction seems to be the long-term idea anyway. It spares them the trouble, if you do it yourself.  And all in the name of &#8220;freedom&#8221;!</p>

<p>  Why do the Dutch &#8220;tolerate&#8221; their own extinction as a people and culture? Isn&rsquo;t the country&rsquo;s unique history and culture worth saving? I don&rsquo;t want a Holland that resembles America. The United States is looking more like a failed experiment everyday. </p>

<p>Because after WW2, the Left seized control and has ruled with an iron grip ever since&hellip;(as happened throughout much of Europe). That&rsquo;s why.  And they have brainwashed the helpless public into a liberal-leftist trance in which they now think bad is good, death is life, etc.  The people never really had a choice.

<p>Well wake up Dutch people. I find this amusing. My father was in the Netherlands in the 1960&rsquo;s. They constantly lectured him on the evil White americans and the Blacks. My dad told them they had no Blacks so no experience or understanding. Oh, no the Dutch then thought they knew it all. I see things aren&rsquo;t working out so well with the Dutch and the muslims. I see things change when diversity is on THEIR doorstep. Live and learn Europe, live and learn.</p>

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>
The powers that ruled within the USA, after WWII, were determined to thwart the spread of communism in Western Europe. Throughout the Cold War we fought it by every means possible. But that resistance to communism  was <i>limited solely to the economic side  </i>of Marxism   &mdash;   the notion of nationalizing property and &#8220;sharing the wealth&#8221;.  THAT side of communism was what frightened the powers-that-be in the USA and elsewhere    &mdash;   the banks, industrialists, etc.   &mdash;   but as long as you left the ownership of property untouched, you could pursue  <i>the cultural aspects of Marxism  </i>all you wanted, and they didn&rsquo;t care about that. They [the capitalist elements] even applauded much of it (ie. the racial egalitarianism, the celebration of diversity and decadence, the multi-culturalism and cosmopolitanism, the hostility to Christian traditions and the enthusiasm for all other traditions, the dilution or outright destruction of concepts of nationality or race, coupled with the importation of ever cheaper labor from primitive countries).  So European governments were left free to pursue socialism instead (cultural Marxism), while communism was confined (quarantined, as it were)  behind the Iron Curtain. </p>
<p>Today, we see the results in places like the Netherlands and Sweden and Labour Party Britain.  After many decades of socialist governments, their populations no longer truly own or control their own countries (or are soon coming to that point). Economically, they have prospered more than Eastern Europe, yes, but racially speaking, they would have been better off had they been on the other side of the Iron Curtain.</p>
