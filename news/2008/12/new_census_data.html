	<p>Among the most notable changes is the number of whites living in Harlem, which has more than tripled since 2000. {snip}</p>
<p>Also, the poverty rate has declined in all but one neighborhood, {snip}.</p>

<p>They also show that the percentage of foreign-born New Yorkers who became American citizens passed 50 percent for the first time.<br>

		<p>They import foreigners so they can legitimately implement multiculturalism, and drives to end &#8216;hate&rsquo; and nativism. They import a few foreigners so that they can crack down on and better control the natives. Soon every newspaper story will revolve around doing what&rsquo;s best for immigrants and people of color and people of color only. Their society will become obsessed with it. And how evil it is in the world and toward people of color. Every one else should just shut up, get used to having their own concerns ignored, and get ready for a life lived in apology for being so &#8216;privileged&rsquo;.   </p>

		<p>Lest we forget, Harlem originally was White until Blacks started moving in, at which point all the remaining White people left.  The Whites left behind what was once one of the most architecturally beautiful parts of New York City, and the Blacks turned the brownstone mansions into tenements and drug dens.</p>
<p>Blacks are of course losing Harlem back to Whites because they just can&rsquo;t take care of it, and real estate in Manhattan is just to valuable to throw away on a useless ghetto.   Hopefully, one day people will be astonished to learn that Harlem had once been a slum inhabited by Blacks.</p>

		<p>Who would ever choose to live in NY city or NJ? Those who are able, get out as soon as they turn 18. My brother is itching to get back down South. I don&rsquo;t ever want to go back.</p>

		<p>I love it when the media uses words like diverse to mean more whites &mdash; finally! I mean, we have to appreciate the small victories and progress in life, right gentlemen? I can attest to the veracity of this report. Harlem is becoming more white for a couple reasons. </p>
<p>First, NYC is just too expensive and while real estate in the rest of America is depreciating in value, NYC continues to appreciate. Harlem is becoming a smart alternative for young adults who don&rsquo;t want the long commute or suburban life, but can&rsquo;t afford to live downtown, i.e. the Village, Soho, Tribeca, Lower East Side, Chelsea, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Second, Columbia University is expanding and a spillover is ensuing from the Columbia neighborhood which is in Harlem. What is especially savoring about the expansion and spillover is that Columbia is a bastion of self-hating, white, limousine liberals and they are unwittingly contributing more than any other entity to the gentrification of Harlem.</p>
<p>Of course, Harlem is still predominantly black. I lived there a few years ago while I was finishing college. I often noticed the pockets of whites in the one or two new condos on a specific block that was either right next to a subway station (which is good for security reasons) or right next to a police station. That is a good thing though, this is how the process begins.</p>
<p>I estimate that in 10-15 years Harlem will have an equal proportion of blacks and whites. I base this estimate on what I saw in the Lower East Side and Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Gentrification in NYC is similar to the snowball effect. It starts out really small and slowly, often with bohemian poor whites, artists and students moving in to rough neighborhoods. But as times goes on, more and more whites arrive, the neighborhood is designated &#8220;up-and-coming&#8221; and then within a matter of years it&rsquo;s reclaimed. Harlem will take longer though because it&rsquo;s huge. Probably 8-10 times bigger than the Lower East Side or similar neighborhoods that have been gentrified.</p>
<p>To conclude, NYC is teeming with potential. It&rsquo;s really becoming a model city for everything great about America. Of course, I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that it isn&rsquo;t perfect and it&rsquo;s not for everyone. But there is a real community of people who reject the idea of diversity for its own sake. I really love living here. For the past 9 years that I&rsquo;ve lived here I&rsquo;ve watched it improve greatly and I feel safe and comfortable anywhere I need or want to go&hellip;. which  may include Harlem some day.<br>
All the best,<br>
Jordan NYC</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got news for you.  Some of the people they&rsquo;re considering &#8216;White&rsquo; aint so White.  Some are, and some are knee-jerk liberals-mostly young ones who might think it&rsquo;s cool to live &#8216;near&rsquo; Black people.  But what of those poor Black people?  They&rsquo;ll be driven out of their neighborhoods and that&rsquo;s (hushed tone)  &mdash;  -racist.</p>
