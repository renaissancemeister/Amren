<h1><a href="http://m.mercurynews.com/articles/188765990">Chinese-American Activists Oppose Any Bill Richardson Cabinet Nomination</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ken McLaughlin, Mercury News, December 03, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a move bound to create political tension between Latinos and Asian-Americans, a group of Chinese-American activists in Silicon Valley has launched a nationwide grass-roots movement to fight President-elect Barack Obama&rsquo;s nomination today of Bill Richardson as commerce secretary. </p>
<p>The group is upset at the New Mexico governor for his handling of the nearly decade-old case of Taiwanese-American Wen Ho Lee, a former nuclear scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. U.S. officials once suspected Lee of giving nuclear secrets to China when Richardson was President Clinton&rsquo;s energy secretary. </p>
<p>The Chinese-Americans say they realize that challenging the nomination of Richardson, 61, the nation&rsquo;s most high-profile Hispanic politician, will ruffle the Latino community, many of whose leaders felt he should have been named secretary of state instead of Sen. Hillary Clinton. </p>
<p>But the Chinese-American group insists that Richardson&rsquo;s refusal to acknowledge making serious errors in the case makes it a moral imperative to oppose his nomination to Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet. They say their criticism of Richardson has nothing to do with him being Latino but everything to do with his lack of judgment in the case. </p>
<p>&#8220;This was the major Chinese-American civil rights case in the last 30 years,&#8221; said Albert Wang, a Fremont physician. &#8220;And there was a feeling among many Chinese-Americans, particularly in Silicon Valley, that Bill Richardson did a lot to promote the notion that all Chinese-Americans are potential spies.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hu, Wang and well-known Chinese-American human rights activists such as Henry Der plan to say in a new letter to Obama today, posted at www.wenholee.org, that Richardson&rsquo;s actions violated Lee&rsquo;s due process rights by firing him without the required legal notice. It will also accuse Richardson of promoting Lee&rsquo;s indictment when there was no evidence that he had engaged in espionage. </p>
<p>Until Richardson apologizes for his actions, the group says, it will continue to oppose the nomination. </p>
<p>Der accused Richardson of fueling suspicions about the loyalties of dedicated, hardworking Chinese-Americans. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Noting that his group has endorsed many Asian-Americans running for local offices, Garza said he hopes &#8220;my brothers and sisters who happen to be Chinese don&rsquo;t allow their resentment&#8221; over Richardson&rsquo;s handling of the Lee case &#8220;to become a single issue&#8221; that could threaten his nomination. </p>
<p>&#8220;And I hope this single issue won&rsquo;t create a major problem between the two groups,&#8221; Garza [Victor Garza, chairman of La Raza Roundtable] said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some political analysts see the dust-up as one of the opening salvos in an evolving political mosaic created by the election of the nation&rsquo;s first black president. </p>
<p>Gregory Rodriguez, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, said the controversy shows that all the talk about a &#8220;post-racial America&#8221; is overblown. </p>
<p>&#8220;We believed we were going to work our way to the point where race did not matter,&#8221; said Rodriguez, author of &#8220;Mongrels, Bastards, Orphans, and Vagabonds: Mexican Immigration and the Future of Race in America.&#8221; </p>
<p>But the reality, Rodriguez said, is that &#8220;race is only going to affect our society in more complex ways.&#8221; <br>

		<p>The Asians are fighting the mestizos, while the mestizos are fighting back and, in turn, they&rsquo;re fighting (and killing) blacks, and the blacks are fighting the Muslims, the Asians, the mestizos, and, of course, they have always pursued a one-sided war of intense hatred against whites.  All of the ethnicities are at odds with one another at any given day of the week.  It never ends.</p>
<p>And every single group resents whites, and in some cases there are groups of Hispanics whose resentment and jealousy have turned to hatred of most all whites, and a good 85% of the blacks despise whites even more, as an extension of their jealousy and resentment.</p>
<p>Add the resentment and hatred of some religious ethnicities against whites, and the overall picture is one in which the entire mish mash of races and ethnicities is one big, constant squabbling mass of contentious chaos that gets worse with each passing year.</p>
<p>And of all the tribal factions it is only whites who really love this country and want to do what is best for it, while the others care not one whit for anything other than pushing ANY agenda they perceive will advance their tribal interests somehow, and to Hell with the country as a whole, as long as they can parasitically consume its money.</p>
<p>Behold, my friends, the stark revelation that is the basic truth of all societies who try their hand at multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Can anyone deny that the entire world is economically falling in a domino effect, because the diversity fools tried to force a rainbow utopia on us?</p>
<p>If this country and the world bottoms out to bare survival, could biological warfare have been more effective in causing such a collapse?</p>
<p>But it is not psychological warfare that has hit us so devastatingly.  It is DIVERSITY.  You know, the thing they&rsquo;ve been repeating in Orwellian fashion so often they succeeded in making some fools believe them.</p>

		<p>Wen Ho Lee was a foreign-born scientist who had his security clearance taken away by the FBI because he was caught placing restricted data on a computer that could be accessed by the public.</p>
<p>He then proceeded to illegally place the same secret data on a different computer that was accessed over 40 times by persons unknown.</p>
<p>When arrested he admitted that during a previous visit to China he had been asked to spy for them by leaking US nuclear secrets to them. He illegally withheld this info from his US gov&rsquo;t employers for 10 years.<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen_Ho_Lee" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen_Ho_Lee</a></p>
<p>Even if he wasn&rsquo;t a spy, he surely deserved to be investigated.<br>
 <br>
The p.c. buffoons who turned him into a martyr have never offered the slightest evidence that Bill Clinton and Bill Richardson were prejudiced against Asians.  <br>

		<p>Excuse me, I would be the last person to defend Reconquista Richardson, but he was right on the Wen Ho Lee Case. Ten tapes with sensitive security issues on them were missing and Lee didn&rsquo;t account for them. It was Chinese money for legal defenses that allowed Lee to basically get off the hook easily. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that the Mexican activists are only concerned about hurting the feelings of their &#8220;brothers and sisters in the Chinese community&#8221;, as the obseqious Victor Garza of the LA RAZA roundtable stated, rather than being concerned about the consequences of Wen Ho Lees actions. I guess matters pertaining to treason against the U.S. are put on the backburner by Mexican activists, if they might get in the way of their political goals. What a sick nation this has become.</p>

		<p>Incredible how every group under the sun in these United States stands up for itself and its members.  And what &#8216;Ranger&rsquo; stated:</p>

<p>-is certainly true.  The biggest problem is for us - Whites.  We, or should I say, most, Whites do not stand up for themselves.  If we don&rsquo;t start soon we&rsquo;re going to lose this country, and the future.</p>

I can&rsquo;t say if Wen Ho Lee was a spy but he did act in an &#8220;unusual&#8221; way.  From what I understand Mr. Lee had data from work that was suppose to be only used on the computer systems at Los Alamos on his own home computer.</p>
<p>Of course the most damaging thing against Mr. Lee was if my memory serves me were the various backup tapes that he had.  Lee supposedly had something like 10 backup tapes.  </p>
<p>Anyone who is a system admin knows that is ALOT of data.  Most computers usually need a single backup tape.  Although there is incremental and differential backup that may require multiple tapes, but Amren isn&rsquo;t a computer website so I&rsquo;ll leave it that.</p>
<p>Wen did have contacts with Chinese scientists but no classified materials were passed,at least to my knowledge or Mr. Lee would be in jail.</p>
<p>Although no one really knows what Ho intended to do with the data the most interesting and probably most likely course of action was free lance consulting.  It happens all the time in government these guys get out and make 2-3x what they were making as government employees working as freelance contractors.  </p>
<p>Also much of the material that Lee downloaded was publicly availble,maybe 99%.  </p>
<p>High level officials were leaking information to the New York Times and were fighting their war in the press rather than the courtroom.  They were trying to create an &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; against Mr. Lee.  </p>
<p>This feeding of information and to the press and the lack of actual signs of espionage (although not gross misconduct) probably got Lee off.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some info about the Lee case:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen_Ho_Lee" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen_Ho_Lee</a></p>
<p>Although there isn&rsquo;t evidence of espionage its hard to say that Lee actions weren&rsquo;t a cause for concern.  In fact breaching mishandling propriety data at many government agencies even private companies, no matter how innocuous the reason, is going to get you into alot of trouble.</p>
<p>In retrospect Lee should have probably learned use GOOGLE he probably could have found everything he probably needed.</p>

		<p>Given the vast amount of espionage&hellip; for both industrial and defense technology conducted by our Chinese &#8220;friends&#8221; over the past half-century or so, I have no sympathy for the Chinese traitors. This also brings to mind our former poster styling himself as John Liu, a year or two ago. He railed out and ranted about how the West (Britain and probably America &#8220;plundered&#8221; China of so much wealth.) Whether that claim has validity or not is a moot point. China stole far more wealth with its espionage, received far more value for that purported plundering in free technology from the West than Mr. Liu could ever force himself to admit. But isn&rsquo;t that the way it always is? When the supposed &#8220;victims&#8221; start their little rants.</p>

<p>Soft?  You don&rsquo;t know the half of it.  Back in the forties and fifties, Chiang Kai Shek (of Formosa   &mdash;   later Taiwan) was faced with a problem of epic opium addiction among the population.  The solution &hellip;?  Shoot all opium addicts.</p>

<p>My father told me that when he was in Taiwan a woman told him that Taiwan was much safer under the Japanese than it was when the Nationalists took over.  You have to remember that at the time when the Nationalist took over that they used what people in even Singapore and today would probably consider a &#8220;tough&#8221; policy on crime.  My father told me at the time there was a case where two people attacked another man with sticks on tv, he told me that they were put to death.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine how the Japanese operated the judicial system if they made Chiang Kai Shek seem like an easy going liberal guy by comparison.  Even modern tough on crime candidates such as Guliani would probably be considered too &#8220;soft hearted&#8221; for Asia back then.   So I suppose &#8220;lawlessness&#8221; is all relative.</p>

		<p>From the Wikipedia article on Wen Ho Lee:</p>
<p>&#8220;The examination of Lee&rsquo;s computer determined that he had taken classified work documents, deleted the security classification headers, and then transferred these files from a system used for processing classified data onto another protected but unclassified network. After the FBI discovered Lee&rsquo;s transfer, they revoked his badge access and clearance, including his ability to access the data from the unclassified but secure network. Lee then requested from a colleague in another part of Los Alamos that he be allowed to use his computer, at which time he transferred the data to a third unclassified computer network. FBI analysts later examined the unclassified computer and noted that the files that Lee had transferred had been accessed from a computer at the Student Union of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) on over forty occasions. Because of the vast number of users who used the computers at the UCLA Student Union and the lack of logs of users, the FBI was unable to determine which entity gained access to the Los Alamos data.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no innocent explanation for behavior like this by an employee at a nuclear weapons lab.  Lee was a spy.  He ought to be in jail, not living off of a 1.6 million dollar settlement.</p>

<p>  I&rsquo;ve heard this as well Yellow man. Evidently, the Japanese had a less draconian policy on Taiwan than elsewhere  &mdash;  Korea or mainland China for instance. Generally, the people of Taiwan were treated relatively well by their Japanese occupiers. Most Taiwanese don&rsquo;t feel the same hatred and resentment that mainlanders feel toward Japan. Of course, criminals could expect very harsh punishment from the Imperial Japanese.</p>

<p>In Death by Government:  Democide in the 20th Century, Professor Rummel reports the following (in a category he refers to as the Deka-MegaMurders):</p>
<p>2. 35,236,000 Murdered: The Communist Chinese Ant Hill <br>
4. 10,214,000 Murdered: The Depraved Nationalist Regime</p>
<p>Number one, of course is the Soviet Gulag State with approximately 61 million murdered  &mdash;  citizens starved, hanged, &#8216;disappeared&rsquo;, shot in the head  &mdash;  men, women, children. Number Three is the Nazi Genocide State, with approximately 21 million murdered in just a few short years.</p>

		<p>BonBon: You omitted something; Rummel rightly states the figure of 50,000,000 murdered by European colonialists.</p>
<p>However Rummel wrongly includes the 20 to 30million starved in Mao&rsquo;s Great Leap Forward famine as deliberate killing. This famine was a result of bad planning, misinformation and natural calamities. Mao had no intention of causing these deaths. </p>
<p>Rummel&rsquo;s sole basis for including the Great Leap Forward deaths as &#8216;democide&rsquo; is the book &#8216;Mao&rsquo; by Jung Chang. This book has been dismissed by even Western scholars as a gross distortion of the historical record. Rummel obviously wants to up the score so he relies on a single unreliable source.</p>
<p>Actual numbers killed/executed by the Chinese communists? Probably about four or five million over a period of 60 years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is true. I would go further than this and say that not an insignificant number of Taiwanese are positively pro-Japanese - especially those not of recent mainland provenance.</p>
<p>Former Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui was a volunteer in the Japanese Imperial army in WWII (interestingly he was a member of the communist party for a couple of years immediately after the war). His brother died fighting for Japan in the Phillipines against the Americans.</p>
<p>Just goes to show that Chinese have even less ethnic cohesion and loyalty than what is purported here for whites. Whites here moan about lack of racial solidarity. Chinese also frequently do -comparing Chinese as a loose grains of sand against the Japanese rock. </p>

<p>John:</p>
<p>Discover the Network, in its series entitled &#8216;Leftwing Monsters&rsquo; reports:</p>
<p>&#8221;..Mao, who saw people only as means to his ends, was unmoved by reports that millions of peasants were starving to death.  Instead, this ruthless megalomaniac calmly declared that, to further his global ambitions, &#8216;half of China may well have to die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The people&rsquo;s republic&hellip; proved so efficient at squeezing the peasantry that tens of millions of villagers starved to death from 1960-62 as a result.  Mao&rsquo;s efforts to build up his arsenal cost an estimated 42.5 million lives.</p>
<p>News of the famine was suppressed by the regime, and what were innocuously called &#8216;food shortages&rsquo; were blamed on bad weather&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8221;..Mao is arguably the greatest mass murderer of the Twentieth Century, perhaps in history.  He easily eclipses his fellow left-wing monsters Pol Pot, Hitler, and even Stalin in the sheer number of corpses he left in his wake&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The authors also report:  &#8220;..Some 70 million Chinese, along with countless Tibetans, Mongolians, Manchus, Koreans, Hmong, Uyghurs, and other nationalities, perished at his hands during his long and brutal reign&hellip;&#8221;  confirming what Professor Rummel writes in Death by Government.</p>

<p>John:</p>
<p>This is simply not true.</p>
<p>I seriously doubt Professor Rummel would be in the position he is in, as respected as he is (many historians use his figures, I found his writings through a respected economist) if his research and writings were based solely on ONE source.  </p>
<p>The notion itself is ridiculous.</p>
<p>I reviewed Professor Rummel&rsquo;s writings about &#8216;China&rsquo;s Bloody Century&rsquo; and noted his estimates are a compilation and collation from MANY varied sources.</p>
<p>Professor Rummel himself writes (specifically about his estimates of the genocide and mass murder in China):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The job here can only be to find a most likely and prudent total of Chinese democide, where most likely means what a reasonable person would agree to on the basis of the evidence and analysis. Several statistical principles will be applied in doing this&hellip;.as many estimates as possible should be included&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is a link to Rummel&rsquo;s methodology and how he arrived at the figures he uses in Death By Government (often updated and revised as NEW information comes to light):</p>
