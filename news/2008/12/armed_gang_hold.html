<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28400813/">Armed Gang Holds Up Freight Train in Mexico</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A gang of about 20 men armed with assault rifles robbed a train in the western Mexican state of Michoacan and carted off some of its freight, the state prosecutor&rsquo;s office said Saturday.</p>
<p>The gang parked a pickup truck across the tracks on Friday, forcing the train to stop.</p>
<p>The assailants then threatened the train&rsquo;s crew and opened some of the freight containers it was carrying.</p>
<p>A statement by the prosecutor&rsquo;s office did not specify what the gang stole from the train, operated by Kansas City Southern, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based railway company.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the thieves may have been after drums of pseudoephedrine, a chemical used in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamines, according to an official at the Michoacan state attorney general&rsquo;s office. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to be quoted by name.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico, which does not make pseudoephedrine, imported it in large amounts in the past. The government has since banned almost all legal imports of the chemical, however, although illicit shipments remain a problem.</p>
<p>Also Saturday, prosecutors in the northwestern state of Sinaloa reported that at least four people were killed in a gunbattle between suspected drug traffickers in a remote mountain area.</p>
<p>The running battle apparently started on Christmas eve and continued for some time in the drug-plagued region known as &#8220;the Golden Triangle,&#8221; near the border with Durango state, assistant state prosecutor Ramon Rodrigo Castro said.</p>

		<p>Growing up in southern California I can say meth was just as popular as marijuana. It was so easy to get that most teenagers just thought it was no big deal. The lives destroyed by this drug are impossible to put into numbers. And if our country had a sane immigration policy this drug would probably have not reached every part of America. I guess manufacturing and selling meth is another &#8220;Hispanic family value&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I was watching a documentary recently about the America&rsquo;s Meth problem (it&rsquo;s a big problem here too&hellip;we call it Ice).<br>
And the three things that I took away were.</p>
<p>1. If you need another reason for border fences and 100 percentage lock down patrols and surveillance it&rsquo;s for these guys&hellip;.. </p>
<p>&#8216;Meth source is from Mexico&rsquo;<br>

<p>2. To stop turning your citizens into these creatures&hellip;.<br>

(Apparently the dopamine release from meth is 10 times what the body produces natrually, thus is highly, highly addictive).</p>
<p>3. And the huge pharmaceutical corporations again have zero morals when putting cold medicine profits over the real well being of the nation, with the millions of dollars spent on lobbyists in Washington to keep pseudoephedrine on the shelves.</p>
<p>The stories of kids growing up with Meth addicted parents are the worst.</p>

		<p>This item illustrates that &#8220;American Values&#8221;, such as the entreprenuerial  spirit and Yankee ingenuity, do not stop at the border, but plummet southward throughout Mexico. I believe that Prez Bush has stressed this as another benefit of massive Mexican immigration.</p>

		<p>So let me get this straight. Piracy is making a comeback for the first time since 1720 and now Mexico is returning to the train heists of the 1870s. So much for progress.</p>

<p>The only reason white liberals don&rsquo;t see it, is that deep down they&rsquo;re too racist   &mdash;   yup, that&rsquo;s right   &mdash;   to understand that non-whites are making money by peddling deadly drugs to their children. </p>

<p>The Mexicans didn&rsquo;t &#8220;take&#8221; the crank market from the bikers and other assorted white trash. George Bush, Congress, and the DEA GAVE the meth market to the Mexicans via the implementation of controls on over the counter sales of pseudoephedrine. The War on Drugs is about as rationally defensible as the Vietnam War and more stupidly executed to boot.</p>

I agree with you.  But that all depends from whose standpoint you see it. Obviously, somebody must be benefiting or it wouldn&rsquo;t continue to exist.</p>
<p>The &#8220;War on Drugs&#8221; keeps a large number of people in profitable employment: among them, lawyers, judges, psychiatrists, social workers, probation officers, jail wardens &hellip;. etc., etc.<br>
It also (by keeping drugs scarce)  keeps the price of drugs high, thus enormously profitable for those who traffic in them.<br>
If drugs were as cheap as aspirin, there would be no drug lords. Think about it.</p>
<p>BTW, I do not by any means advocate drug use, and I recognize that its control presents a big problem. But there has to be a better way.  Obviously, the way we have been following has not been working and is only making the wrong people rich.<br>

		<p>I still use Sudafed-containing antihystamines during the summer hayfever season.  I actually prefer it because it causes drowsiness; I received allergy shots for several years and got enough benefit from them that a Sudafed in the evening lets me sleep like a rock, and I still don&rsquo;t sneeze during the next day.  It is a perfectly useful drug if used responsibly and not chemically modified into methamphetamines.</p>
<p>Meth is simply too addictive for anyone to be a &#8220;casual user&#8221;.  All the best intentions in the world will not help, any more than they would help someone who decided to lay down on train tracks.  Some folks have trouble with alcohol, but meth is too much for anyone.  </p>
<p>What the meth faces site GenX in Oz posted the link to doesn&rsquo;t show the viewer is what these meth users end up doing to their teeth and their careers.  Their teeth usually end up looking like blackened, rotting lumps of cheese.  One meth-user I used to know was a TSA passenger screener before he started using the stuff.  He spent every cent he earned on the drug, maxed out credit cards, ruined his credit, and stole from his friends.  Now he is doing three years-to-life with life on parole as a sex-offender in Canyon City, for sexual assault on a child.</p>
<p>The long-term neurological damage from the excessive l-dopamine release has not been adequately explored, but it is suspected that former users will face lifetime problems with depression.</p>

<p>Meth was (and still is) a big issue around here, b/c MO and IL used to be way up there in the number of meth labs busted.  However, they were &#8220;trailer park&#8221; small time operations.  The Mexicans are big into big quantity meth, that&rsquo;s more potent (ironically, called ICE) than trailer park meth.  But just because the trailer park meth labs are gone doesn&rsquo;t mean the meth addicts are.  And who&rsquo;s filling the void?  Mexican gangs.</p>
