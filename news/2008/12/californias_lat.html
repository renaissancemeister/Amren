<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-eligible10-2008dec10,0,1997070.story">California&rsquo;s Latinos and Blacks Still Lag in University Eligibility</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Gordon, Los Angeles Times, December 10, 2 008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite recent improvements, Latino and black students continue to lag behind whites and Asians in becoming academically eligible to enter California&rsquo;s two public university systems, according to a state report released Tuesday.</p>
<p>The study by the California Postsecondary Education Commission also showed that female high school seniors still do significantly better than males in taking required classes and earning grades and test scores that could gain them admission to the University of California and California State University systems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study reported that 22.5% of Latino high school graduates were eligible for Cal State in 2007, up from 16% in 2003, when the last such study was done. For black students, Cal State eligibility went up to 24%, from 18.6%.</p>
<p>Latino and black eligibility for UC&rsquo;s more rigorous standards were 6.9% and 6.3%, respectively, last year, slightly higher than four years ago.</p>
<p>White and Asian students did better in meeting requirements for both universities. For Cal State, 37.1% of white high school graduates were eligible last year and 50.9% of Asians, both somewhat higher than in 2003. For UC, 14.6% of white graduates and 29.4% of Asians met course, grade and test score requirements; those rates were both slightly lower than in the previous survey.</p>
<p>Factors holding down eligibility rates for black and Latino students include shortages of the necessary courses and sometimes inadequate counseling at high schools in many low-income, often predominantly minority areas, Haberman said.</p>
<p>Overall, Cal State rates rose mainly because more students met new requirements to take a second year of history and lab science, said Adrian Griffin, the commission&rsquo;s research director. Griffin presented the report at a meeting Tuesday in Sacramento.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Griffin attributed the drops in white and Asian eligibility for UC to tighter course and grade requirements at the university.</p>
<p>Griffin also suggested that California&rsquo;s high school exit exam, required since 2006, cut out weaker students and may have affected eligibility rates somewhat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On a sliding scale that also includes standardized test scores, UC&rsquo;s minimum grade point average in required high school courses is now a 3.0 &mdash; a B average on a 4-point scale &mdash; and Cal State&rsquo;s is a 2.0, or a C average.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The eligibility study, which surveyed 72,000 transcripts at 158 public high schools around California, found that UC and Cal State requirements are well-aligned with their missions under the state&rsquo;s 1960 master plan for higher education.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they bother to even publish information like this, because academia is so corrupt nothing they submit can be regarded as truthful.  They&rsquo;re concerned more with fabricating stories favorable to blacks they don&rsquo;t take time to teach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why so many other countries are out-performing the US today, when they were behind us several years ago, before this PC calmity shifted into high gear.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s correct to say the school administrators, teachers and profs in this country are incompetent.</p>

<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so.  Black and hispanic rates were up, but white and asian rates were down?  Much more likely explanations for this are affirmative action and the inflation of minorities&rsquo; GPA.  The inevitable result is giving spots to unqualified blacks and hispanics in place of qualified whites and asians.  I would bet good money that this is the real explanation.</p>

<p>Posted by ice at 6:58 PM on December 12 </p>
<p>Ice:</p>
<p>Many, but not all school administrators are incompetent.  Often their hands are tied by burdensome, onerous federal and state regulations and laws.  If the administrator is White, he faces constant charges of racism or doling out racial favors.  He also knows that if test scores don&rsquo;t improve, he (and the teachers) will be blamed, never the students (or the students&rsquo; IQs), as administrators live and die by NCLB-mandated test results.</p>
<p>As for keeping order, most administrators know that the downtown idiots at the politburo keep a racial head-count as to the number of NAMs disciplined and/or suspended, demanding that black suspensions stop because the numbers are so disproportionately high.  Thus, much of the crime committed by black students  &mdash;  assaults, robberies, theft, destruction of property, outright violence  &mdash;  is covered up and dismissed by the schools&rsquo; head office. </p>
<p>And as for teachers:  I&rsquo;ve known many finely educated, dedicated, competent teachers who&rsquo;ve put their hearts and souls into trying to educate blacks and have simply given up because of blacks&rsquo; pathological behavior, poor study habits, dismal test results, and the teacher constantly having to worry about being accused of racism.  With hispanics, teachers must put up with student apathy, language difficulties, lack of focus and drive, and all-around disinterest in school (reflected in their 50% drop-out rate).  And teachers well know the &#8216;students&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be disciplined.<br>
 <br>
For us teachers, especially White teachers, it&rsquo;s simply a no-win situation. Many experienced teachers depart in anger and frustration for better schools or leave the profession altogether  &mdash;  leaving the worst schools for Teach for America types (that often clear out by Christmas), interns, uncredentialed teachers, first year teachers that don&rsquo;t know better and substitutes.</p>
<p>The school districts in California have twisted themselves into knots to comply with NCLB federal regulations, i.e., All Teachers Must Be Highly Qualified.  The definition of &lsquo;highly qualified&rsquo;, according to the courts, now includes teacher interns and teachers in training  &mdash;  inexperienced teachers who will temporarily fill the ranks of inner city schools. And so the cycle continues&hellip;</p>

		<p>Gabrielino High School in San Gabriel, a city a few miles east of Los Angeles, has a student body that is about half Mexican and half Chinese.  Several years ago, there was a stink when a Chinese boy wrote in the school paper that 60% of the Chinese and only 4% of the Mexican completed the required classes for admittance to the University of California.  Since the school provides the same resources for all students, the boy concluded that the Mexicans simply did not value education.  (He was allowed to finish the last couple months of his senior year at home.)   It seems that some high school seniors have a better grip on Occam&rsquo;s Razor than the scholars at the California Postsecondary Education Commission.</p>

<p>Yes.  It is the same with those teary-eyed personal interest news articles about Black thugs, which usually begin with: &#8220;Jamal was starting to turn his life around.  He had recently begin visiting again the 4 mothers of his 4 children, and was planning to get a job and was working toward his dream of becoming a Rap Star, when tragedy struck . . &#8220;<br>

		<p>No wonder all the television shows and Hollywood movies are pushing miscegenation so blatantly.  Until the Blacks and Hispanics can fool enough White women into bearing  their children and sharing their White DNA (which is the Genetic Holy Grail), the academic achievement gaps will persist.    </p>

		<p>This always cracks me up. Anyone and I mean ANYONE coming to America passes up the majority of blacks within a very short period of time. What part of this very obvious message is being missed? Hasn&rsquo;t anyone heard this: Water always seeks it&rsquo;s own level. </p>

		<p>&#8220;California&rsquo;s Latino&rsquo;s and Blacks Still Lack in University Eligibility&#8221;</p>
<p>and&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. so&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. Should I or any other taxpayers be biting our knuckles in concern by now? </p>
<p>Whenever I read newspapers headlines such as these I&rsquo;m reminded of a new commerical that is being currently run on television where I live. It&rsquo;s sponsored by some governmental agency.(also know as the U.S.taxpayer) A group of women are complaining in an arrogant tone that they are going to serve their kids &#8220;healthy Meals&#8221; from now on and nothing is going to stop them. Huh?! No one is forcing them to feed the kids junk. But the tone of the commercial is kind of like it&rsquo;s someone elses fault that their kids are unhealthy. If Blacks and Latinos are underperforming, educationally, why is that the American taxpayers concern? It should be their parents concern.</p>

<p>It SHOULD be the taxpayers concern simply because they will be the source paying the inevitable welfare and criminal incarceration costs, while at the same time suffering the results of the associated criminal behavior associated with the ignorance, poverty, and stupidity of that particular group&hellip;better to put Johnny in a trade school if he can&rsquo;t - OR refuses to be educated. </p>
<p>All boils down to public safety and economics&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Well maybe if they hit the books instead of the dope and the booze and the crimes they commit, that might be a step in the right direction.  Lord knows they get every break in the book, that includes picking our pockets because they don&rsquo;t have to pay a dime to get a college education or for that matter, any kind of education, it&rsquo;s free, on our taxpayer bucks. Now if that&rsquo;s not a crime, I don&rsquo;t know what is???  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!</p>
