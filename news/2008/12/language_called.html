<h1><a href="http://www.healthzone.ca/health/article/557666">Language Called Health Care Barrier</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lesley Ciarula Taylor, Toronto Star, December 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A significant number of immigrants, including many newcomers to Toronto, say they are ill because they can&rsquo;t speak English well enough to tell anyone, a doctor who advocates for immigrant health reveals in the current Canadian Journal of Public Health.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found clear linkages&#8221; between health and language, says Dr. Kevin Pottie, a researcher at the Institute of Population Health and professor at the University of Ottawa. &#8220;It&rsquo;s another level of evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People don&rsquo;t really want to talk about this. People are hiding it or not documenting the poor outcomes. There is a certain shame in the medical profession that we don&rsquo;t do a better job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pottie and four other researchers talked to 11,802 immigrants in search of data for what he calls &#8220;one of the most important issues for health care for immigrants and refugees right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike in the United States, there are only a few case studies of dangerous medical lapses because of lost translations, some stretching back 20 years. In the U.S., multi-million dollar lawsuits have forced 13 states to require trained professional translators in hospitals and clinics. In Canada translators are mandated only in courts.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are marginalized people who can just barely survive, let alone create the kind of atmosphere where someone would write about them,&#8221; says Pottie, a specialist in immigrant and refugee health.</p>
<p>Just over a year ago, a Vietnamese mother of three was dying of cancer but her medical team at North York General Hospital couldn&rsquo;t tell her.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had no idea what was happening to her,&#8221; said Frank Wagner, bioethicist for the Toronto Central Community Care Access Centre. &#8220;It was a basic violation of a human right. She has the right to get her affairs in order, to die with dignity, to agree to palliative care if she wants it.&#8221; His organization swallowed the costs of a translator for three visits.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re waiting for a volcano to explode,&#8221; says Stella Rahman, co-ordinator of Cultural Interpretation Services at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. &#8220;And it will.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2006 census found 44 per cent of people in the GTA had a first language other than English. While big teaching hospitals, such as St. Michael&rsquo;s and the CAMH, use translators, smaller hospitals and community health centres tend to get by on bilingual staff or relatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctors spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on their education and then ask a child to deliver a diagnosis,&#8221; says Axelle Janczur, executive director of Access Alliance Multicultural Health and Community Services, which supplies interpreters for health services. &#8220;We think it&rsquo;s okay for the janitor or the kitchen staff to do the translating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Jose Silveira is director of the Portuguese Mental Health and Addiction Services of the University Health Network, part of a unique program that uses bilingual teams in five languages to treat people who otherwise would, in Janczur&rsquo;s words, &#8220;have to suck it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is easier for me to order a $1,400 CT scan than a translator &hellip; even though that information will be more valuable than a CT scan,&#8221; Silveira says. &#8220;It&rsquo;s up to me to decide on enormously expensive medical tests. It&rsquo;s up to the hospital administration to decide on interpreters.&#8221; The damage caused by the language wall is enormous, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our patients are some of the sickest in psychiatry. Many of them don&rsquo;t have family doctors. By the time we see them, they are much further along and their treatment is prolonged.&#8221;</p>
<p>University of Toronto professor Kathi Wilson also found fear and confusion keep immigrants away from doctors. Findings from her focus groups with 53 immigrants in the Dixie-Bloor Neighbourhood Centre area in Mississauga, published last March, discovered language was a main reason why they avoided getting medical care.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a daily concern on their minds &mdash; asking for directions, describing what was wrong, whether doctors would be able to understand them or that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to understand what the doctor was telling them to do,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Despite Wilson and Pottie&rsquo;s studies, Canada still doesn&rsquo;t have the kind of research already done in Australia and New Zealand to back up the theory that translators mean faster, better care and fewer dangerous or deadly mistakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is lots of literature (showing) that the cost is infinitesimal compared to doctors&rsquo; or nurses&rsquo; time. Overall, costs go down when professional interpretation services are used,&#8221; says Elizabeth Abraham, president of the board of the Health Interpretation Network at UHN.</p>
<p>She argues the lack of translators violates the fundamental right of universal access to health care.</p>
<p>There has been progress. The Health Interpretation Network brought together community health and translator groups for the first time to come up with the National Standard Guide for Community Interpreting Services, which spells out requirements for interpreters, clients and institutions.</p>
<p>Next year, all city hospitals will have to tell the Toronto Central local health information network how they plan to ensure patients get &#8220;culturally competent, high-quality interpretation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The impetus was a report in July by Dr. Bob Gardner, director of policy at the Wellesley Institute, that pointed to language as one of three big blocks to equal health care.<br>

		<p>Strom Thurmond was right in 1964.  The Civil Rights bill would lead to socialism, would force people to associate with those they did not wish to, and you can see more &#8220;victims&#8221; have been added and given entitlments as a result.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Not having interpreters violates immigrants&rsquo; &ldquo;right to health care.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Well, then I suggest the government chip in a few million for interpreters so it can go downhill faster, after spending billions, like the US, to keep the financial institutions from collapsing.</p>

		<p>Well, it works both ways. As a Canadian, after waiting for hours in a crowded waiting room to see a doctor (ain&rsquo;t socialized medicine great?), I have on more than one occasion finally gotten to see a doctor only to find out that his/her command of the English language is less than satisfactory. Doesn&rsquo;t make for a good diagnosis. Not to mention that I&rsquo;ve been delayed at the pharmacy because a doctor&rsquo;s English was so bad that he actually prescribed the wrong medication (at least the pharmacists I&rsquo;ve encountered to date can all speak English). Is this not a violation of my human rights, not to mention a potential threat to my health?</p>
<p>Would the human rights professionals hear my case? Of course, since pigs don&rsquo;t really fly, I already know the answer.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got an idea. Why don&rsquo;t we just require EVERY doctor to be fluent in EVERY known language in the world before they could get their degree. God knows we CAN&rsquo;T expect these leeches-er- immigrants to learn the language of the countries they&rsquo;re mooching off- -oops,sorry- - living in.</p>

		<p>Does Japan face all these problems of multiculturalism and diversity?  No, and their society seems to work just fine, does&rsquo;nt it.  Only in the West has multiculturalism become the new religion with all its inherent problems.</p>

		<p>In my opinion these symptoms of regress are statistically necessary attributes of conspiracy to derail evolution by turning all maladaptive lifestyles and behaviors (except, perhaps, for expressions of conservatism) into adaptive strategies by means of reverse discrimination and earned income redistribution.</p>
<p>As a result, Darwin&rsquo;s least fit that would face elimination to the more fit, not only fare well under the auspices of the nanny state, but even manage to exercise higher fertility that the most fit; making tons of kids has been their main hope for group survival for millennia, now.</p>
<p>And <i>voila</i>, the unintended consequences in the form of people moving backward in the evolution of human species are visible with a naked eye.</p>
<p>The above is a perfect illustration of what the &#8220;progress&#8221; means in the politics of the Left. It means stopping evolution in tracks, and even reversing it backwards.</p>
<p>Kinda weird sort of progress, isn&rsquo;t it?<br>

		<p>The article states that not having an interpreter violate&rsquo;s a person&rsquo;s &#8220;basic human right to health care&#8221;. I find it curious that in this country, welfare recipients and illegal aliens have a &#8220;basic human right to health care&#8221; while legal residents and people who don&rsquo;t recieve welfare (such as myself) only have the &#8220;basic human right to health care&#8221; if our employers decide to have a decent insurance policy. </p>

<p>Access to health care isn&rsquo;t a fundamental right.</p>
<p>That said, clearly the right to access to health care isn&rsquo;t the &#8220;problem.&#8221;  The problem is they want recognized a &#8220;fundamental right to translators, and universal health care&#8221;, i.e., they want rights <i>beyond</i> those of the natives.</p>

		<p>One of my doctors in the past told me the health care system in Canada did start having budget problems since just a few years ago.  If the health care system in Canada does start spending for translators, then the health care system in Canada will experience even bigger problems&hellip;  that I do not even want to imagine.  I am a non-white immigrant to Canada, and I wholeheartedly agree that the health care system in Canada is not obligated to provide translation to its patients (except French, which is one of the two official languages in Canada) and if the immigrants aren&rsquo;t happy they are welcome to go back to their homelands.  </p>
