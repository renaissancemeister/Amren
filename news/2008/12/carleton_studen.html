<h1>Carleton Students Petition to Impeach Union President Over Cystic Fibrosis Gaffe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Boutet, National Post, November 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Embarrassed Carleton students are getting closer to ousting the members of their student council responsible for a cystic fibrosis gaffe that garnered national attention.</p>
<p>Frustrated by their student council&rsquo;s recent decision to drop a cystic fibrosis charity as the beneficiary of its annual Shinearama fundraiser because the disease &#8220;has been recently revealed to only affect white people, and primarily men,&#8221; Carleton students are attempting to clear their school&rsquo;s name with a petition to impeach their union president.</p>
<p>The motion to change the frosh week charity passed the Carleton University Students&rsquo; Association council almost unanimously earlier this week, but a national outcry &mdash; including a Facebook group to reinstate the charity that has gathered thousands of members &mdash; that followed caused the student association to backtrack Wednesday.</p>
<p>CUSA president Brittany Smyth said she was &#8220;very sorry for the confusion&#8221; and stated that an emergency meeting of the association&rsquo;s council is planned for next Monday evening and she&rsquo;ll be personally trying to rescind a decision to pull CUSA support for the annual &#8220;Shinerama&#8221; fundraiser.</p>
<p>But despite CUSA&rsquo;s efforts to backtrack on the controversial decision, a student movement has emerged to impeach Ms. Smyth and councillor Donnie Northrup, the science councillor who wrote the motion.</p>
<p>Spearheaded by Carleton&rsquo;s public affairs councillor Kailey Gervais and student Rebecca Gill, the petition drive to remove Ms. Smyth from office has already collected more than 1,000 of the required 1,250 student signatures &mdash; 5% of the total student population &mdash; in two days of circulation. A separate petition calling for Mr. Northrup&rsquo;s ouster has collected approximately 40 of the 90 signatures required from students in the science faculty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students have mobilized so quickly in two days,&#8221; said Ms. Gervais. &#8220;I think we&rsquo;re showing that despite the council&rsquo;s actions, students at Carleton are responsible and we don&rsquo;t deserve the reputation we&rsquo;ve gotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, Ms. Gill added, the most important outcome is that Shinearama is officially reinstated, and she anticipates that this will happen at Monday night&rsquo;s meeting. &#8220;But this is also about re-establishing Carleton&rsquo;s reputation,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;We want to clear our names, make sure people know that our voices were not represented.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once the petition drive has reached its goal, the signatures will be sent to Carleton&rsquo;s office of student affairs where they will be validated as coming from students. From there, the petitions will be brought to the attention of student council, which may then choose to put forward a motion to remove Ms. Smyth and Mr. Northrup from office.</p>

		<p>Great to see Carleton students got together to correct this mistake. I am betting that they were pretty much all caucasion though, finally a good example of whites getting together to purposly defend their race from a deliberate attack.</p>

		<p>This story is getting a lot of play, but I actually find this student&rsquo;s gaffe far less offensive than the changes to the nationwide system of liver transplants that has supposedly been made &#8220;race blind&#8221; but now actually favors blacks over whites (even though whites make a far higher percentage of donations in the first place).</p>

		<p>Wow, Whites responding to their own self-interests, that&rsquo;s a great sign. Perhaps we will see a lot more of this in the future. Maybe the election of Obama has changed things. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the authorities are acting with the proper true sensitivity here. Still, being fired for not providing appropriate support for the white man or his image? The reverse has certainly done wonders for the USA all these years. </p>

		<p>Caught in their anti White male bias, the idiots retract. But they still are idiots and there still is anti White bias.</p>

		<p>Go Carlton students. Your&rsquo;e finally performing activism that&rsquo;s valuable to you and your nation, rather than the type of activism( illegal immigrants rights, hate speech laws,etc.) that tears it down.</p>

		<p>Kudos to the comments above!  </p>
<p>There are very few &#8220;charities&#8221; that I give to.  Most of them put a White child&rsquo;s face on a poster and ask White people for money, even though I could tell that most of the donations would go to minorities that seek our demise. </p>
<p>I have unhesitatingly given to the cystic fribrosis kids for years, because I KNOW that about 98% of children affected with that illness are White.  </p>
