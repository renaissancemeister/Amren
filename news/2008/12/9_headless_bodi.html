			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 1, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The bodies of nine decapitated men were found in a vacant lot in Tijuana Sunday, part of a wave of violence that claimed at least 23 lives over the weekend in this border city plagued by warring traffickers, authorities said.</p>
<p>The heads were discovered in plastic bags near the bodies in a poor neighborhood of Tijuana, across from San Diego, Baja California state police said in a statement. Three police identification cards were also found at the site.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 4,000 people have died so far this year in drug-related violence in Mexico.</p>
<p>Across Tijuana on Sunday, attacks by gunmen killed five people in addition to the nine beheaded bodies.</p>
<p>State police said nine more people were killed in attacks on Saturday. In one, gunmen killed a 4-year-old child in an attack on a grocery store.</p>
<p><b>Drug cartel war</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President Felipe Calderon on Sunday vowed his government would never negotiate with drug lords no matter how much the violence escalates.</p>
<p>Since taking office on Dec. 1, 2006, Calderon has sent more than 20,000 soldiers to battle drug trafficking across Mexico, helping to seize of 70 tons of cocaine and 3,700 tons of marijuana, he said.</p>

<p><br/>
Not exactly an honest description of what is going on.  Calderon has decided to use his military as police officers to fight crime.  Such methods are not appropriate relative to the situation.  Mexico is at war with insurgents hell bent on overthrowing the government and turning mexico into a narco-state.  Calderon is doing the right thing by bringing in the military.  However, they should not be attempting to arrest these people.  They should be foucussed on killing them off.  Now, before they have time to raise an army.</p>
<p>Because he isn&rsquo;t doing this, Calderon is slowly losing this war the drug lords have declared on him.</p>
<p>Mexico is going to have to come to a decision and soon.  Does it want to continue to exist as a country anymore or not.  If so, then it has several tough changes it needs to make.</p>

		<p>Mexico is the nation the elites and organizations such as the ACLU, LA RAZA, The Southern Poverty Law Center, LULAC, MALDEF, various Chambers of Commerce and dozens if not hundreds of other special interest(anti-American)groups, hope to merge the United States with one day, while in the meantime they facilitate Mexicos criminality in this nation as much as they can. They are all traitors by any other name. In another day and age in the United States, these groups wouldn&rsquo;t even be allowed to operate. They&rsquo;d all be seen as fifth columnist subversive groups, which is what they are. Interestingly, these subversive groups have convinced a large number of Americans that it is the white founding population of the nation that is some kind of threat, rather than the activities of their own corrupt organizations.</p>

		<p>This is typical Mexican behavior  &mdash;  they have the right idea, but lack the style and panache of the Romans, who would put hundreds of heads of their enemies impaled on pikes in plain view for anyone who entered the city, just to remind them of what would happen to anyone who stepped out out line.</p>
<p>The Vikings, the Saxons, and the Celts all did similar displays of intimidation  &mdash;  the Mexicans are just tackier and don&rsquo;t have the impressive armor.</p>

		<p>I agree with above poster Bobby and believe that the new administration will cause the threat to America to rise by making it easier for illegals to enter AND Mexican drug lords to access the American market.<br/>
Obama is appointing Arizona&rsquo;s Governor, Janet Napoitano, as head of Homeland Security. She has a history of resisting the enactment of more anti-illegal laws with her veto pen.  Despite that, Arizona has forged ahead with state initiatives to address the invasion.  However, as head of Homeland Security she will obviously work with Obama to lower our guard and work for the goal that both she and Obama share, unlimited amnesty.</p>

		<p>  The meltdown of Mexican law enforcement has gotten little attention from the Fourth Estate. Narco-terroists are close to bringing down the country. It is entirely possible that when the worldwide recession hits Mexico full force that the country could descend into total anarchy. We could see mass migrations of Mexicans to the United States that would completely overwhelm social services in all of our South Western states. We are extremely close to that already  &mdash;  California is bankrupt! </p>

		<p>&#8220;President Felipe Calderon on Sunday vowed his government would never negotiate with drug lords no matter how much the violence escalates.&#8221;</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t have the option of negotiation.  The drug lords will soon be powerful enough to take the country in a coup with their own paid soldiers, plus the ones who desert the regular Mexican Army and who are on the drug payroll right now.</p>
<p>Much drug bribes are influencing border state governments on the US side and are in the pockets of the cartels right now.  That will increase.</p>
<p>They will make their move on Mexico City likely when Mexico&rsquo;s economy worsens right along with the rest of North America. The US will be too busy fighting to survive itself to spare the manpower to assist.</p>
<p>In our lifetimes, we will see Mexico and the Southwest US up to southern Nevada be the New Narco Republic to the south that will secede and join with Mexico to be one &#8220;Aztlan.&#8221;   Many have been dilligently working to accomplish the job, especially La Raza.</p>
<p>Blacks will be driven from the area, after many firefights in the Los Angeles area.</p>

		<p>Same sort of stuff happened in the US during prohibition.  Serious demand, ruthless suppliers, and limited funds to fight the war.  If Mexico were smart, it would just go ahead and legalize drugs.</p>

		<p>Just another typical day in old Mexico. Stay tuned. It will be here soon enough. Has anyone noticed that the crimes committed against Americans by Mexican illegals have brought no comment from Bush, Obama, McCain or any of the pro-illegals that infest Washington? Yet, one murder of an illegal causes cries of anguish from Mexico City to New York. Can&rsquo;t win for losing, people. Aren&rsquo;t we something else? Invaded and colonized by a third world bunch of parasites. where are those who swore an oath to protect and defend. Guess we should have made it clear that it&rsquo;s supposed to be us!</p>

		<p>In the meantime, Mexico blames the USA for THEIR crimes, because of what they see as  &#8220;lax gun control laws&#8221;.</p>
