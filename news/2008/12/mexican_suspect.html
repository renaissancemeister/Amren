<h1>Mexican Suspected in Police Killings Beheaded</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Dec. 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man suspected of shooting his mother and killing three police officers called to the scene was found beheaded in southern Mexico on Tuesday, authorities said. </p>
<p>Fabian Ramirez&rsquo;s head was found at a highway intersection in Iguala, a town southwest of Mexico City, according to a statement from the Guerrero state Public Safety department. </p>
<p>A message was found nearby: &ldquo;This is what happens to all those who kill a police officer or a soldier.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The department said Ramirez shot his 50-year-old mother in the back Monday, wounding her. He then allegedly killed three police officers who arrived at the scene, including Iguala&rsquo;s police chief. </p>
<p>Police captured Ramirez later that day, but four armed men broke into the jail and took him away by force. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The four armed men were dressed in black and had lettering on their clothes identifying them as agents of Mexico&rsquo;s Federal Investigative Agency, the statement said. However, none of the police officers who had been guarding Ramirez recognized the four men, the department said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The message was signed, &ldquo;the people&rsquo;s avenger.&rdquo; <br>

		<p>And yet, Mumia Abu-Jamal is still alive.  This shows you the difference between whites and Chicanos/Mestizos   &mdash;   If Mumia were in Mexico, this would have been his fate.  In the United States of America, for the most part, and while it&rsquo;s still white, there is due process of the law.</p>

		<p>The man didn&rsquo;t deserve to live. We&rsquo;ll all get what we deserve.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past the U.S. federal government to do such a thing. They watch after their own hinds if they can&rsquo;t do anything else. So I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t put it past Mexico&rsquo;s Federal Investigative Agency to do this.</p>

		<p>There needs to be more of this going on. Even here in the US our court systems are dysfunctional. It&rsquo;s really time for the honest citizens to take a proactive stance regarding criminality. Lynching certainly kept people in line as did public executions.Once a public display of a noose served to remind people there was a price to pay for their dark deeds. Now because of minority whining this display has suddenly become a crime. And the sad thing it is these same minorities which commit the majority of crimes that should require the death penality.</p>

		<p>  It seems like every time I turn around somebody else is being beheaded by Narco-terrorists in Mexico. I thought all the headhunters were in Boreno? Is this some kind of gruesome Aztec cult? It makes me want to avoid Mexico at all costs. </p>
