<h1><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/15/AR2008121503066.html">Hispanic Immigrants Drop in U.S. Labor Force</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alejandro Lazo, Washington Post, December 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The percentage of Hispanic immigrants who are working or looking for a job in the United States has declined for the first time since 2003, according to a study released yesterday.</p>
<p>The Pew Hispanic Center, which published the report, said the findings are a testament to the nature and depth of the recession, which is rooted in slumping housing values, as many Hispanic immigrants found work in construction in the boom years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study was based on data from the Current Population Survey, which is produced jointly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau. {snip}</p>
<p>The percentage of Hispanic immigrants who were either employed or actively looking for a job at the end of the third quarter was 71.3 percent, compared with 72.4 percent a year ago, according to the study. The drop comes after steady yearly increases since 2003.</p>
<p>The number of Hispanic immigrants in the labor force increased 150,000 from the third quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2008. But that growth was much smaller than the growth in the working-age population of Hispanic immigrants. Overall, there are 17.1 million foreign-born Hispanics in the working-age population.</p>
<p>The decrease was sharpest among immigrants from Mexico, who make up more than two-thirds of the U.S. Hispanic immigrant population. The share of Mexican-born immigrants in the U.S. workforce declined to 70.7 percent from 72.7 percent, according to the study.</p>

		<p>As so many posters have pointed out, their may be a drop in the labor force, but they will never go back to their countries of origin until the GRAVY TRAIN OF BENEFITS, is taken away.</p>

		<p>So there is a miniscule drop in the amount of Hispanics in our labor force. Now reflect HOW MANY JOBS ARE LOST TO AMERICAN WORKERS, thanks to the criminal illegal aliens&hellip; undercutting Americans and pushing them out of our job market.</p>
<p>Reflect also that in our future scenario, the adult anchor babies of these illegals will be competing with American workers for ever-decreasing available jobs. So would anyone care to explain what &#8220;good&#8221; accrues to Americans from 30 to 35 million illegal immigrants? Note that this reflects only PART of the cost of illegal immigration. It doe snot factor in the many, many crimes by illegals and members of their families. Nor can we overlook the cost of supporting them, the social problems they cause in our country.</p>

		<p>Just think of this, fifteen to twenty years down the road. When American jobs are at an absolute minimal. Thanks to outsourcing. The adult anchor babies of today&rsquo;s illegal immigrants will be fighting our own children for the scarcer and scarcer job opening! But the greedy contractors, restaurant owners, fast food franchise holders and the like&hellip; they don&rsquo;t give a damn about the future of our own people. Making that extra profit today is all they care about. Like I said&hellip; THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE! </p>
