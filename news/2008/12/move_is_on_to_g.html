<h1>Move Is On to Get Black Males to Church</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauren R. Harrison, Chicago Tribune, December 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The answer to stemming the rising violence by and against young black males could be in getting back to basics, a local community activist said.</p>
<p>Phillip Jackson, director of the Black Star Project, was joined by several Chicago pastors Thursday who believe that the basics can be found in church, long the cornerstone of social change in the black community. They called on religious institutions to invite black males, ages 2 to 32, to worship services next week.</p>
<p>The initiative, dubbed &#8220;Take A Black Boy to Church,&#8221; focuses on getting black boys and men off the streets and into church.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 22 churches across the nation are scheduled to participate. Several Chicago churches are holding special youth services Sunday.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t this already happen?  I mean, from what I can tell, nearly all black mothers that go to church take their young sons with them.  And what will going to church do to help the situation?  After all, I don&rsquo;t think most black churches are the fount of &#8220;hellfire and brimstone&#8221; sermons, mostly charismatic feel-good accompanied by music, or hate-whitey agitprop.</p>

<p>Yeah, so they can disrupt and misbehave at a different location. </p>
<p>If they think morality will rub off on them, they&rsquo;re really naive.</p>

		<p> For one thing, black males who believe people who work honestly for their living instead of hustling drugs or &#8220;ho&rsquo;s&#8221; are &#8220;chumps,&#8221; are not going to attend church in any appreciable numbers. For another, if they did, the black churches they were attending would become corrupted and tainted by them (the ones that aren&rsquo;t already corrupted and tainted, that is).</p>
<p> It goes far beyond spending an hour in church on Sunday, hearing some maniac like the Rev. Wright spew anti-White hatred. It&rsquo;s part of a whole world view that says, &#8220;The Man done screwed us, White folks can&rsquo;t be trusted, so take whatever you want, by whatever way you have to use to get it.&#8221; You might call it the &#8220;Don&rsquo;t be a chump&#8221; world view. And yet, who are the real chumps? Those blacks who are killing each other, and being killed.</p>

<p>It seems that it is White men who need some religion.</p>

		<p>Yes, take a black kid to church.</p>
<p>Just make sure it&rsquo;s Trinity United or one just like it with a rabid anti-white racist like Wright, Moss and Pfleger, telling them repreatedly that they are failing not because they don&rsquo;t try or because most of them just can&rsquo;t grasp complicated subjects, but because of the racism, outrageous acts, and oppression by whites.</p>
<p>Soon, they&rsquo;ll have a nice little group of mind-conditioned rapists, muggers, and killers, who will commit crimes, and go to prison&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. but only because of the injustice of whites against blacks, of course.  What other reasons could there be?</p>

		<p>I support this. Rather than letting them sit around on playstation, watching tv, or running the streets preparing to take over the cells of the last generation currently filling them the little ones are cleaned up and taken to church. It&rsquo;s a part of the socialization process and the instillation of values and morals each child should get.</p>

I don&rsquo;t.  What values and morals would a child  be likely to get in a black church (that he can&rsquo;t learn elsewhere)?  All that whoopin&rsquo; and hollerin&rsquo; and rolling on the floor, not to mention the racist sermons, are not going to do anyone any good or impart any  sense of morals.  In fact, some of the worst crooks and charlatans are black ministers. </p>
<p>And Jarrod: maybe that&rsquo;s why white men do better in life and keep out of jail.  All that church experience you allege  doesn&rsquo;t seem to have to done black males any good, considering their high crime stats and prison records.</p>

		<p>It is much easier for blacks to blame whites for their shortcomings rather than admit that they occupy the bottom rung of the world&rsquo;s social ladder.  Virtually everything from the cars they drive to the written words they write came from whites and this fact fills them with a sense of inferiority and self-loathing.</p>
<p>They have no desire to return to their African ancestral homes because they know that their ancestors lived better centuries ago in as slaves in America than their African descendants do today in Africa.   </p>
<p>They also know that black on black slavery thrives in Africa today as it has since the dawn of time.  They proudly call themselves &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; today yet they shun Africa like the plague, because the truth about their race is more than they can bear&hellip;<br>

		<p>To take Black males off the street, you have to give them a socially useful role by cutting off welfare and automatic child custody to Black females who have turned the ghetto into a matriarchy.</p>
<p>Remember, there was a time when Black crime was a lot lower (though still high compared to Whites ofc).</p>

		<p>Church is a good place to take your children, But if you don&rsquo;t have any home training, church is not going to help, Teaching your child at home when he is born into the world to do the right thing will keep him out of jail and trouble, Posted by Dee&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I ask you: What does a man (of any race) get out of church?</p>
<p>The women dominate the conversations (and all the commitees) in Sunday School, the pastor tells him to become a doormat, and, as a male, he is religated to a low position since the church teaches that the stronger shall be thrown down, and the weaker shall be exalted.</p>
<p>If he is an intuitive-type introvert, it is even worse since the whole Christian gestalt is extrovert in nature, with a whole scheme of propostions being imposed upon you.       </p>
