			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Curl, Washington Times, December 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Declaring Barack Obama&rsquo;s election a &#8220;very hopeful moment for race relations,&#8221; President Bush asserts his own administration did much to empower minorities, calling the No Child Left Behind education law &#8220;a piece of civil rights legislation&#8221; and saying his call to overhaul Social Security was aimed at giving blacks a greater stake in the nation&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, who leaves office in exactly 30 days, said he had worked hard throughout his eight years in office to lift minorities, in part by increasing homeownership and expanding opportunities for small businesses. But he said that the Republican Party will have to find new ways to persuade blacks and Hispanics that it is working in their best interests, citing his landmark bipartisan education bill to hold failing schools accountable as a prime example.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Bush said Mr. Obama&rsquo;s election is a &#8220;moment of healing for the country,&#8221; but added that race relations &#8220;is an evolving issue.&#8221; Still, the election of the first black president clearly moved the president, who leaned forward in his chair by a fireplace in the Oval Office as he recounted what he saw on the day his successor was chosen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was touched when I saw on television people with tears streaming down their face saying, &lsquo;I never dreamt I would see this day.&rsquo; And there was a lot of emotion and a lot of pride in America as an African-American rises to the presidency. And to me this is a very hopeful moment for race relations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Bush said his ownership society was &#8220;aimed at a lot of people,&#8221; especially the black community. And while Democrats opposed the creation of personal savings accounts with investments in the stock market &mdash; investments that would have been prone to the very financial meltdown that has occurred on Wall Street &mdash; Mr. Bush said overhauling Social Security would have benefited minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Obama&rsquo;s challenges</b></p>
<p>While Mr. Bush has been retrospective in those recent interviews, The Times asked him to look forward, especially to the trials and tribulations that will face the incoming president.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
Further out on the radar screen, Mr. Bush said, Mr. Obama will need to deal &#8220;with these drug cartels in our own neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the front line of the fight will be Mexico.&nbsp; &hellip; The drug lords will continue to search for a soft underbelly. And one of the things that future presidents are going to have to make sure of is that they don&rsquo;t find a safe haven in parts of Central America,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>So, President Bush&rsquo;s self-proclaimed two best &#8220;civil rights&#8221; accomplishments are the No Child Can Get Ahead act, and minority home ownership programs.</p>
<p>(1)  Just because you team up with The Swimmer to pass a Federal law that states that the races must be equal in academic achievement doesn&rsquo;t make it possible.  However, that is the tight spot that NCLB puts many school districts in.  The only solution for equality is to dumb down white students.  Then again, true equality necessitates handicapping the best.  Harrison Bergeron wasn&rsquo;t just a fictional character.</p>
<p>(2)  When you use the force of the Yankee government to force financial institutions to give mortgages to otherwise uncreditworhty people, you might as well be a five-year old kid with the super duper ultra deluxe Chemistry Set, and wonder why there&rsquo;s a charred hole where your house used to be.  What is happening now with the housing market and the financial system is an inevitable and exclusive consequence.</p>
<p>President Bush cites Obama&rsquo;s election as a milestone.  I should add that President Bush is much responsible for that, because if it weren&rsquo;t for his screw ups, the American people would have been in no mood to elect a mulatto with three Arab names.  Because of that, working class whites had no other recourse, they voted their pocketbooks.</p>
<p>To paraphrase JohnPM, may God help us all, because we&rsquo;re gonna need it.</p>

		<p>Here is another example of some politician just blurting something out and a large number of people will take it hook, line and sinker!  There was not anything wrong with race relations before, and after the majority white population watched the nobody Obama win with over 95% of the black vote, just because he is &#8220;partly&#8221; black; race relations will probably worsen!</p>

		<p><i>Declaring Barack Obama&rsquo;s election a &ldquo;very hopeful moment for race relations,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Nice. Yet another Republican who&rsquo;s actually glad the GOP lost. If they keep this up, the GOP will congratulate themselves out of a job (maybe they already have).</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s take this logic to its obvious conclusion. If one &#8220;black&#8221; president is good, aren&rsquo;t more better? Shouldn&rsquo;t 12% of all elected presidents be black? How about making  every other president black, just for good measure? How about if we elect some black presidents just to prove we aren&rsquo;t racist, even though the warning signs show that the individual black candidate is not best for this country (as in the case of Obama)? Do you see how it starts to become idiotic? How, instead of a &#8220;color-blind&#8221; society, we get a more and more color conscious  &mdash;  even color obsessed  &mdash;   society? </p>
<p>But that is exactly what Bush said: It&rsquo;s good that Obama got elected simply <i>because</i> he is black. Where do you draw the line? </p>
<p>And if Obama&rsquo;s election is a &ldquo;very hopeful moment for race relations,&rdquo; then what is the sign that blacks have finally &#8220;overcome?&#8221; When blacks perform on a perfect parity with whites?  This hasn&rsquo;t been achieved even in South Africa or Zimbabwe, where blacks vastly outnumber whites.</p>

		<p>The Republicans have apparently decided they have to pander to the blacks now, reaffirming their reputation as the Stupid Party. Watching Bush try to spin his legacy by paying lip service to multiculturalism is completely disgusting, not that I pay much attention to anything he says these days. As far as I can tell, his speech could have been delivered by Nancy Pelosi or Barney Frank or Hillary Clinton, which just goes to show you how much difference there is between the parties anymore. The Republicans are history and good riddance. They were hijacked by the neocons years ago and they&rsquo;re just as bad as the Democrats now, if not worse. They&rsquo;re definitely just as evil.</p>
<p>In reality, Bush has been the worst president in US history and this train wreck of a country&rsquo;s never going to recover from the last eight years, especially with the Obama crowd waiting to give it the coup d&rsquo;grace. Bush and his neocon handlers lied the country into the pointless invasion of Iraq and the occupation is still dragging on, costing us billions every day  &mdash;  billions we don&rsquo;t have  &mdash;  and he&rsquo;s leaving the economy in absolute ruins. We&rsquo;re heading into a major recession, if not an outright depression, and the value of our currency is probably going to be wiped out by all the trillions the Fed&rsquo;s pumping into the system (most of which is being stolen by Wall Street and the big banks who refuse to tell anyone where the money&rsquo;s going.) </p>
<p>This is bad, folks. It&rsquo;s just getting started. After Christmas, we&rsquo;re going to see an avalanche of retail bankruptcies and the next shoe to drop will be commercial real estate, followed, most likely, by the credit card companies and so on down the line as this phony economy unravels. The Democrats have their paws all over this fiasco, but Bush and the Republicans have to take direct responsibility for the disaster they&rsquo;re leaving behind. I used to be a Republican decades ago, but they routinely betrayed every principle they claimed to believe in and now that they&rsquo;ve been hijacked by the neocons they&rsquo;re completely unrecognizable. </p>
<p>The Federal government&rsquo;s tripled in size under Bush, a so-called &#8220;conservative,&#8221; and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he goes down in history as the last nail in the coffin of the United States. When Bush first took office, we were already in serious trouble, but we were still marginally a Democratic Republic with a free-market capitalist economy. We are now living in a crumbling Socialist state with a black President and we&rsquo;re heading straight down the toilet. That&rsquo;s Bush&rsquo;s legacy. He was worse than Clinton or Carter, worse than Warren Harding even. The quality of our so-called &#8220;elites&#8221; has been declining steadily over the years, but Bush has defined a new bottom. Maybe Obama will beat his record for venality and incompetence. That remains to be seen.<br>

		<p>Bush single-handedly destroyed the Republican party&hellip; and we let him do it. I do not vote on the lesser evil. If a politician is not  a true Republican then he won&rsquo;t get my vote. For this reason, I couldn&rsquo;t vote for John McCain. I did a Ron Paul write-in.<br>
Republicans need to wake up and realize that they will never be able to get minority votes. </p>

		<p>  And this my friends, is the proof that the republicans and democrats are the same animal, with different approaches toward the same goal. Democrats are communists and republicans are neo-cons, the exact same thing. Neither party has a shred of decency nor a shred of loyalty to anyone except themselves. Jorge Boosh and Balack Odummy are cut from the same cloth of treason. God help us? Not unless we try and help ourselves.</p>

		<p>For all you &#8220;conservatives&#8221; out there who voted for Bush (twice!), I can only express my sincere condolences. (And of course your man McCain threw the election and went on Leno to laugh about it.  Wonderful guy.)  This snotty graduate of elite Northeastern schools can&rsquo;t seem to ever express any gratitude at all to the white middle class who elected him.  And don&rsquo;t you just love the way Bush and his ilk continue to pander to minorities who will NEVER vote for Republicans?  Breathtakingly stupid. Now that the Bush family have thoroughly dismantled the Goldwater-Reagan wing of the Republican Party, where do you &#8220;conservatives&#8221; propose we now go?</p>

So Bush claims to have empowered minorities and how do they repay him? The same way Powell does, by turning on him and the Republicans.</p>
<p>Actually it was more like Bush&rsquo;s ineptness, the Republicans failure to challenge voter fraud, and the main stream media bowing down to Obama that was responsible for Obama&rsquo;s election to office. </p>

		<p>This sounds like the last gasp of a treacherous man who betrayed his own and his country.  He cares more about Central America, Africa, Iraq, Blacks, Jews, you name it than his own race or his own country. History will not vindicate this man, not to me or any other racially aware White person.  His biggest crime was ushering in the next treacherous Socialist President and single-handedly ruining his own party. Don&rsquo;t vote Dem or Republican again if you really care about your country. Vote with your conscience!</p>

		<p>Bush didn&rsquo;t single handedly destroy the Republican party. Native Born White Republican voters destroyed the Republican party. Every time they voted for a Republican president and Senator, they voted for a massive increase in post-1965 non-white immigration. As a consequence, non-whites in America had the political power to vote  an anti-white Kenyan bigot- who is hell-bent on making Native Born White Americans an ever dwindling racial minority-president of the United States. I mean how dumb can you get? No excuses.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mr. Bush said his ownership society was &#8216;aimed at a lot of people,&rsquo; especially the black community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In part by increasing home ownership&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This really boggles my mind. Look at these two quotes. Bush is actually boasting that he helped create the sub-prime bubble that led to the implosion of the economy and he&rsquo;s admitting that affirmative action for blacks was the motivating factor.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>These old-style WASP country-club Republicans don&rsquo;t have a clue. They really don&rsquo;t. They sold out to the neocons and they did it for cash and personal advantage. Then, once they squirmed their way into power, they managed to screw up everything they touched. You think these characters are smarter than you because they&rsquo;ve got Ivy League degrees and big jobs in the Federal government? They&rsquo;re not. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really amazing. They lied to us for years and created this gigantic disaster, and now they&rsquo;ve decided that the way forward is to start pandering to minorities. There&rsquo;s no principle here; no guiding intelligence; no connection to the real world. Every decision they make is wrong, but they&rsquo;re definitely getting rich in the process. The country&rsquo;s collapsing and they&rsquo;re all millionaires.</p>
<p>Think there&rsquo;s a connection?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re headed for a cataclysmic disaster and NOBODY in Washington is capable of dealing with it. In fact, everything they&rsquo;re doing is going to make it worse. Just look at the crowd getting ready to take over: Obama, Pelosi, Harry Reid, Barney Frank, Hillary Clinton. They&rsquo;re going to take a major recession and turn it into a depression, expand the war in the Middle East, run up trillion-dollar deficits and trash the currency, and don&rsquo;t be surprised to see European-style hate-speech legislation in a couple of years that will shut down sites like this and make us all criminals.</p>
<p>Gerald Celente, the trends forecaster, told Fox News recently that he expects to see a food riots, tax rebellions and revolution in America by 2012. He&rsquo;s also forecasting the rise of a third party as a response to the incredible level of corruption and incompetence in Washington. A couple years ago, I would have dismissed these kinds of apocalyptic forecasts, but Celente&rsquo;s got a good track record and none of this stuff seems all that outlandish now. In fact, it seems like a good description of reality.</p>
<p>The current disaster is a golden opportunity for the White Nationalist movement.</p>
<p>Too bad we don&rsquo;t have one.</p>

		<p>This may be a bit off topic but I just heard an interview by Tucker Carlson with John Lott, the author of MOre Guns Less Crime.<br>
Lott was a colleague of Barack Obama at the University of Chigago Law School. Lott related that he approached Obama and introduced himself to which Obama replied &#8220;Oh you&rsquo;re the gun guy&#8221; to which Lott responded tentatively &#8220;I guess so&#8221;. Obama then offered &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think that people should be allowed to own guns&#8221;.  Lott, in a conciliatory way, suggested that maybe the two of them could have lunch some day and discuss the issue. According to Lott, Obama turned his back and without a word, walked away.<br>
This is getting very scary.  I used to think that the people who saw a conspiracy on the part of our own government to eliminate the middle class i.e. Caucasians, were a bunch of lunatics.What better way than to eliminate the first line of defense that people have.  The &#8220;edgy&#8221; people that one hears on George Noory and Ian Punit&rsquo;s Coast to Coast programs are sounding less and less crazy as events unfold.</p>

<p>There was nothing wrong with race relations before if you&rsquo;re willing to accept the thousands of Whites who are beaten, raped and murdered every day by Black sociopaths who correctly feel that they have Carte Blanche to take Whites any time they want. We can all hide our heads in the sand and say &#8221; No, nothing wrong here!&#8221;<br>

		<p>I voted for Bush twice (and his father twice). I deeply regret having done so. The Republican Party sold out long ago. I hope they never return to power.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that the one thing blacks are able to do with more success than whites is organize.  The NAACP, and the CBC are far more successful at pushing their agenda&rsquo;s than any pro white group.</p>

		<p>Obama then offered &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that people should be allowed to own guns&rdquo;. Lott, in a conciliatory way, suggested that maybe the two of them could have lunch some day and discuss the issue. According to Lott, Obama turned his back and without a word, walked away.<br>
_________________________</p>
<p>If this really happened, and somehow it seems quite believable, Obama was inappropriately dismissive and rude, not to mention opposed to Americans&rsquo; Constitutional right to defend themselves.  &#8220;Oh, you&rsquo;re the gun guy.&#8221;  Is that respectful to say to a gun expert?  Then for Obama to walk away without a word after he was invited to lunch?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.    </p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, many experts on narcissism (a psychiatric disorder where people are full of themselves) think that Mr. Obama might be a narcissist.  If the media will cover him objectively, we may get more hints.  A major cause of narcissism is a tumultuous childhood where a child is alternately spoiled with attention so he feels very important, then deprived of attention so he feels rejected.  The child then develops a sort of alter ego where he is convinced of his magnificence and that others are much less important.  His subconscious does this as a protective mechanism so he will never feel insecure and rejected again.</p>
<p>You might then think that narcissists should have our sympathy because of the emotional pain they endured as children, but in fact they are difficult, mean and hard to love.  They are extremely arrogant and can play-act that they care about others if it gets them somewhere, but in actuality they feel superior and only care about themselves and sometimes their immediate family (because they are a reflection on them).  Quite a few world leaders through history have been narcissists.</p>

		<p>Now that the Bush family have thoroughly dismantled the Goldwater-Reagan wing of the Republican Party, where do you &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; propose we now go?</p>
<p>Pure ignorance but expected. What a farce from the red party of Marxist Lincoln who destroyed the real America and set off the neocon chain of events worldwide. <br>
This is the reason whites are so conned failed to understand Goldwater was a neocon and southern whites were ran out of the DNC  real conservative party after 1964 and replaced by MLKers. </p>
<p>Today you clearly see the neocon trap and end result. </p>

<p>There you go: the REAL reason the MSM wanted BHO to win; the registration, licensing, police permiting and then eventual confiscation of firearms. BHO is a mirror image of Jesse Jackson when it comes to guns. He even takes JJ&rsquo;s position on &#8220;semi-automatics&#8221; i.e. we have to BAN your assault rifle, which the Sam Zell-owned Chicago Tribune states in editorials is &#8220;reasonable&#8221; gun control.</p>
<p>Invest in YOUR future by buying handguns and large-capacity semi-automatics. The foolish American voters got the Messiah they voted for, and we are about to reap the whirlwind. Just look at the parade of gun controllers we going to get: David Axelrod, Ron Emmanuel&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Bush says Obama election a &ldquo;very hopeful moment for race relations.&rdquo; </p>
<p>How utterly naive, but expected of this incompetent president.  Blacks will never regard any gesture as significant enough to drop their hatred of whites&hellip;&hellip;and about every other race as well.</p>
<p>They will always be whining about one thing or another, en masse, because they&rsquo;re just too childish and mentally incompetent, as a group, to recognize a situation that would be to their benefit if they accepted it and quit whining.</p>

		<p>George Bush the Worse?  This depends on the criteria.  If the measures are: 1) Americans killed in useless wars, 2) destruction of the constitution, and 3) tyranny imposed on U. S. civilians, then Lincoln wins hands down.  He is followed by FDR, Wilson, LBJ and Truman.   </p>
<p>To be realistic, under Bush II the following positive things have occurred:</p>
<p>1.Neither the homeland nor a major interest of ours overseas has been attacked since 9-11.<br>
2.No goofy federal hate speech laws have been passed under Bush II<br>
3.No significant gun laws were passed and one was allowed to sunset. <br>
4.A small tax-cut,  FOR PEOPLE WHO PAY  INCOME TAXES, was passed.<br>
5.A couple of reasonable supremes were appointed to the court.</p>
<p>Bush II&rsquo;s biggest failures are:</p>
<p>1.Spending us into oblivion and expanding the welfare state<br>
2.Ignoring wide open immigration and the &ldquo;Mexicanization&rdquo; of America<br>
3.Establishing the hideous DHS and CBP.  Both should be abolished tomorrow<br>
4.The war.  Yet perhaps history may call it differently.</p>
<p>Although McCain was the most despised RINO in the senate, he still could have won.  All he had to do was call a press conference on the capitol steps and say the following: &ldquo;I will not vote for a pork larded bill that spends your tax money on a bail out for the banksters and the big boys on wall street.&rdquo;  Likely this would have pulled in the six percent white vote he needed to win.   But his main campaign theme remained, &ldquo;I will save your mortgage and  I will work with Democrats.&rdquo;   Not inspiring.</p>
<p>Will the GOP learn?  Of course not.   Bush and McCain spent most of their time courting blacks and Mexicans while ignoring whites, their natural base.  I still hear the RNC talking up the big tent idea and allowing as how Republicans must attract more minorities; the same song that has spelled their doom recently.    </p>
<p>Finally, somewhere in the mix we must fit into the worse scale Carter and Clinton.  But in reality both are so forgettable they can&rsquo;t even make the all time &ldquo;bad&rdquo; list. </p>
<p>Form Yankee occupied territory.</p>

		<p>The GOP needs to disintegrate, completely collapse as a political party.  Let a new party arise from its ashes, a party dedicated to White interests, even if they don&rsquo;t openly say so.  All they would have to do is say No to immigration and No to anti-White policies, such as affirmative action and hate crimes laws.  Let all the RINOs join the Democrats, or the Whigs for that matter.  It wouldn&rsquo;t matter much if the new party never won a Presidential election, since they could only do so by betraying us.  The real value in such a party would be in bringing White interests into a national forum, thereby encouraging more Whites to think racially, and developing a corps of racially aware White leaders.  In what I think may be the chaos of the near future, electoral politics won&rsquo;t matter much anyway.  </p>

		<p>George W. Bush has single-handedly done more damage to this nation than other president in our history.  He confuses moral cowardice with with cooperation, grinning idiotically as the Democrats use his head as a speed bag.</p>
