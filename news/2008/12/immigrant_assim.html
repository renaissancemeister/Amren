<h1>Immigrant Assimilation Critical, Report Finds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Wall, San Bernardino Sun, December 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the United States becomes more diverse, a greater effort must be made to integrate immigrants into American society, according to a new report by a federal task force.</p>
<p>The steady rise in the foreign-born population and shifting demographic patterns make it essential for the country to embark on a renewed &#8220;Americanization&#8221; movement to preserve social unity, the report states.</p>
<p>President Bush created The Task Force on New Americans in 2006. The task force, which included members from 20 federal agencies, delivered the report to Bush this month. The 67-page document provides recommendations to strengthen immigrant-integration efforts across the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report, &#8220;Building an Americanization Movement for the 21st Century,&#8221; recommends enhanced English language education for immigrant adults, including a focus on electronic learning and distance learning.</p>
<p>It also calls on the federal government to work more closely with the private sector and community-based organizations to promote language and civics programs.</p>
<p>The need for increased assimilation efforts has become stronger because of the rapid growth in the immigrant population over the past 40 years, according to the report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The rapid demographic change and new settlement patterns could be troubling developments unless there are successful efforts to incorporate immigrants into American political and civic life, the report says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk of marginalized or fragmented enclaves can create social tension in the short term and may ultimately threaten to undermine the very fabric of values and principles that unite all Americans,&#8221; according to the report.</p>
<p>Elsa Valdez, a sociology professor at Cal State San Bernardino, doesn&rsquo;t agree that immigrant enclaves pose a threat to the American way of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s total nonsense,&#8221; Valdez said. &#8220;We have had immigrants coming for over 200 years. America as a country has never become Balkanized, and we haven&rsquo;t had a civil war with different groups fighting each other. The only reason you have enclaves or segregated communities is we haven&rsquo;t done a very good job integrating the different immigrant groups economically and socially in terms of jobs, health care and education.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But others are concerned that too much illegal immigration is making it harder to integrate people of diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who come here need to be assimilated into the American mainstream,&#8221; said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. &#8220;If we are going to successfully bring this huge cohort of immigrants into the mainstream, it has to be a cooperative effort on both sides. One of the things we&rsquo;ve seen for a long time is the assimilation process is hindered by continuing high levels of immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Armando Navarro, an ethnic-studies professor at UC Riverside, views the demographic transformation as a positive. President-elect Barack Obama, whose mother was white and father was black, is an impressive example of how far this country has evolved as a culturally and ethnically diverse society, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, many Americans are multicultural in their lifestyle,&#8221; Navarro said. &#8220;They go to an Italian restaurant one week and a Mexican restaurant the next. One night they&rsquo;re listening to mariachi music and the next night they are embracing hip-hop. This says something for what this country is all about.&#8221;</p>

		<p>One of the reasons Obama is assimilated even though his father was an immigrant (or whatever we should call him) is that his mother was an American.  If both of Obama&rsquo;s parents were from Kenya he would probably be doing something else right now.  </p>

<p>Therein lies the great fraud of it all! Mr. Valdez knows damned well that those 200 years worth of immigrants were almost exclusively European-Caucasians, from similar or fully compatible cultural backgrounds, etc. Indeed, many came from nations that were, for all intents and purposes, MORE advanced than America at the time! Now, of course the reverse is true, and the results are predictable. Valdez is a liar and all who think as he does are as well. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The steady rise in the foreign-born population and shifting demographic patterns make it essential for the country to embark on a renewed &ldquo;Americanization&rdquo; movement to preserve social unity, the report states.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t this admit that social unity isn&rsquo;t possible, if assimilation doesn&rsquo;t take place?  </p>
<p>Right now there are more of the Navarro types within the Hispanic population than those who favor assimilating.</p>
<p>And blacks refuse to assimilate at all, but I doubt that they could even if they tried.  They&rsquo;re just too much different than everybody else.</p>
<p>So, with not many within the non-white ranks willing to blend in with American culture, traditions and history, we have what amounts to a contentious mass of tribal entities that are constantly pushing for more power and influence, because they want to replace whites as the controlling faction.  They don&rsquo;t want equality.  They want power and control, as if they could do anything with either if it were given to them.  </p>
<p>I notice they&rsquo;re citing statistics far into the future above as if nothing will ever deviate from its present course, making it possible to make projections as to what is going to be the situation decades from now.</p>
<p>My advice to this reporter is that he&rsquo;d better wait to see what is going to come down in the next four years before he decides to point out to everyone what we can expect to see in the future, because the forecasts he outlines could very well change drastically.</p>
<p>Professor Panarin, from Russia, has been forecasting a US break up and secession for ten years now, and he correctly forecast our present situation.  Ten years ago the journalists were laughing at him.  Not anymore.  In fact he has them camped out on his doorstep tryng to get quotes.</p>
<p>And, we all know Chittum, Buchanan and MANY others have been predicting break up for years now.</p>
<p>Taking all this into consideration, especially the ongoing financial meltdown, isn&rsquo;t it reporters like this one trying to tell us what the situation will be years from now, spouting what could be truly regarded now as foolishness?</p>

<p><p>Her Mexican forefathers disagreed with her.  They on the one hand did not prohibit immigration but on the other hand demanded that Americans settling Mexican northern territories (such as Texas) in the early 19th Century adopt Catholicism and the Spanish language, and pledge allegiance to Mexico to the exclusion of any other nation.  <p>Those American settlers did not however assimilate, and Mexico lost its territories to the nation the settlers emigrated from.  That should be an object lesson to us now that the tables are turned.</p></p></p>

		<p>What an utterly unmitigated jewel of idiocy this article is:</p>
<p>&#8220;The rapid demographic change and new settlement patterns could be troubling developments unless there are successful efforts to incorporate immigrants into American political and civic life, the report says.</p>
<p>&#8216;The risk of marginalized or fragmented enclaves can create social tension in the short term and may ultimately threaten to undermine the very fabric of values and principles that unite all Americans,&rdquo; according to the report.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe the powers that be, should have thought of this before they reduced the country from 89% white yesterday, in their collectively and truculently willful stupidity, to only about 65% or 64% white today? Moreover, there is a &#8220;catch-22&#8221; to all of this as we progress downward, since &#8220;diversity&#8221; is supposed to be a &#8220;strength.&#8221; If that &#8220;magical&#8221; thing is such a &#8220;strength,&#8221; why fret about its minor shortcomings now, as it approaches zenith? </p>
<p>What is the problem?</p>
<p>Well, enter Comrade Valdez:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&rsquo;s total nonsense,&rsquo; Valdez said. &#8216;We have had immigrants coming for over 200 years. America as a country has never become Balkanized, and we haven&rsquo;t had a civil war with different groups fighting each other. The only reason you have enclaves or segregated communities is we haven&rsquo;t done a very good job integrating the different immigrant groups .&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;?????</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken Comrade Valdez, a civil war was fought in the 1860s, in a USA that was largely integrated among Americans: &#8220;economically and socially in terms of jobs, health care and education,&#8221; if not regionally or by way of some &#8220;peculiar institutions.&#8221; In that civil war, between 700,000 and 800,000 Americans died, and we still live with its most general ramifications today. </p>
<p>How about that, Comrade Valdez?</p>
<p>Any answers?</p>
<p>Yes, I thought not!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>This article contains the usual opinions of the usual reconquista clowns. Armando Navarro, Mexican nationalist and reconquista, paid for by the U.S. taxpayer who says for instance, that &#8220;I won&rsquo;t allow a non-hispanic to build my pool or do any construction on my house.&#8221; Remember, his salary is paid for by the California taxpayer. How&rsquo;s that for diversity? As I said before, having lived in California for most of my life, these Mexican professors and politicians are all cut from the same cloth,namely, whatever Mexicans in the U.S. demand, they are entitled to.</p>

		<p>The only rational statement made in this article was by  Ira Mehlman.  It is possible to assimilate immigrants if that population remains at 10% of your total population or less.  When it exceeds that, the immigrants begin to assimilate the natives, which is why many White Americans &#8220;One night they&rsquo;re listening to mariachi music and the next night they are embracing hip-hop.  This says something for what this country is about.&#8221;  Which is to say that it is about social manipulation and consumer disception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s total nonsense,&rdquo; Valdez said. &ldquo;We have had immigrants coming for over 200 years. America as a country has never become Balkanized, and we haven&rsquo;t had a civil war with different groups fighting each other.

<p>This is nonsense.  I and many White Americans like me, and a growing number of Blacks have been effectively driven out of California by Hispanic crime and the sense that the California State government was simply stealing from White tax payers to pay for immigration, legal or not.  I was put out of business by Mexican gangs who burglarized and vandalized my office.  I held on for a few years, but California became a very hard place to have a small business.  I know of so many Whites who have been victimized violently by Hispanics, children and adults.  My own cousins daughter was raped by a Mexican.  It goes on an on.  </p>
<p>Valdez is lying through her teeth.  She wants more money for her people.  Her people have been waging a war against Whites for decades.  Just because there are no battle lines and campaigns doesn&rsquo;t change that fact.  It has been a sort of political/terror campaign.  La Raza promised in the late 1970s that they would take over and Valdez held up as an authority on American culture is proof of this conquest.  Now our invaders are defining who we are to us.</p>

No, it&rsquo;s not the same to have immigration only from Northern and Western Europe than having immigrants from all over the world. How can you integrate a Vietnamese with a Mexican with a Nigerian with a Black American with an Haitian with a Russian with a Cuban with a Chinese&hellip;? </p>

<p>The reason we have separate enclaves is because lack of jobs, health care and education&hellip; Except for poor whites who are the &#8216;largest number of the poor&rsquo; but who don&rsquo;t have white communities. Because it would be evil to have an exclusively white community. And there was evil. Hundreds of years of white segregation, that must be guarded against even now. And yet in 2008, immigrants from every corner of the globe (immigrants of color) manage to travel 5,000 miles to the USA and set up exclusive racial communities surpassing hundreds of years of white evil in a mere decade. Of course, only whites can really be evil. We should probably celebrate their cultural expressiveness, and their commitment to &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.   </p>

		<p>Of COURSE the &#8220;professor&#8221; who disagrees is named Elsa Valdez. Liberal, American-hating, most likely first generation mex who got her doctorate through the wonderful world of affirmative action. The sad thing is people probably see her &#8220;credentials&#8221; and accept whatever she says as legitimate and having a solid background, blind to the fact she probably made substandard grades and was basically handed a free degree without doing the work.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Assimilation&#8221; is NewSpeak for &#8220;interbreeding.&#8221; Don&rsquo;t you ever forget it, and make sure your children understand, as well. Germans, the Irish, Poles, Swedes, and other Europeans were able to &#8220;assimilate&#8221; into American society because they were able to interbreed with Anglo-Saxons without destroying the genetic stock.  The same can never be said (or expected) of the non-White aliens currently flooding our land. As a White man, I don&rsquo;t want assimilation because, historically, assimilation of non-Whites has destroyed great White civiliations.</p>

		<p>This country was built by whites and rose to a high civilization because of the superior genetic make-up.  The flooding of this country by non-whites will destroy it as like past advanced civilzations.  No matter how many studies pay by the white taxpayers to justify the flooding of this country by non-whites, it cannot negate the fact that when inferior genes become the majority it always equals a third world society.  If these non-whites were so superior it would be reflected in their country of origin and whites would be asking them for help.  These statements that come out of non-whites&rsquo; mouths are nothing but manipulation to always get more from whites.  Even when these non-whites are at a higher economic advantage than even some whites due to affirmative action, they still want to maintain that competition advantage.  I have this guy living next door who owns two houses worth, one at 2M the other at 1.3M who still registers himself as a minority owned disadvantaged business which means he gets in front of a white in trying to obtain business deals.  These non-whites will always grab for more if you do not say enough is enough.  It is unbelievable that this country is self-destructing itself in playing the holier than thou game in catering to inferior genes.</p>

<p>But growing ethnic tribalism isn&rsquo;t the whole, or even the more serious, problem. As Steve Sailer has brilliantly pointed out, there exists a looming human capital crisis with the mean IQ of the US plunging 6 or 7 points in a few decades as Mexican mestizos (mean IQ 
<p>And if Ms Valdez thinks a civil war is impossible, then perhaps she ignores the true cause of the Rodney King riots: it was the whole fabric of multi-ethnic LA society abruptly tearing at the seams, triggered by a single racial incident. Imagine a similar wave of violence sweeping over the whole state of California, or the &#8220;American Southwest.&#8221; What&rsquo;s to prevent it? I&rsquo;ll be happy to tell you: a police state, with an end to free speech, and onerous hate crime and affirmative action laws. In short, an end to civil society as America has defined it for the past 233 years.</p>
<p>And all because of our insane immigration policies for the past 40 years, to which the American people NEVER, EVER consented.</p></p>
