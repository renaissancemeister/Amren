<h1>Somalis Leaving U.S. for Jihad</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick Poole, Pajamas Media, December 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Ahmed [Shirwa Ahmed], who killed himself in a suicide bombing attack in Somalia in October, is just one of up to 40 men from the Twin Cities area who have disappeared and are feared to have returned to their homeland for training with the al-Shabaab terrorist group to wage jihad.</p>
<p>The FBI is investigating similar disappearances in other major Somali communities in Columbus, OH, Atlanta, Boston, San Diego, and Seattle. There are even reports coming from Europe, recently from Denmark, of Somali men returning home to fight with al-Shabaab and other terrorist organizations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Predictably, Somali leaders in many of these cities are claiming surprise and shock that anyone from their communities and mosques would be leaving the U.S. for jihad. But as Daveed Gartenstein-Ross explained in a Fox News report, there exists an active recruiting and transportation network in the U.S., including Minneapolis, for Somali-run terrorist training camps, many of which have recently reopened. In many instances, these same Somali leaders purporting ignorance and innocence for the local media are not only aware of these recruiting operations, but have actively participated in them.</p>
<p>A year ago I reported here at Pajamas Media (&#8220;Homeland Insecurity: Terrorist Fundraising in the Heartland&#8221;) on a November 2007 jihadist fundraising and recruiting event held at the Crown Plaza Hotel in Minneapolis, featuring two high-ranking representatives of the Eritrean-based Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS). {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This event was definitely intended to organize and mobilize the extreme elements of the Somali community here to support the armed struggle against the internationally recognized Somali government and oppose U.S. foreign policy. {snip}</p>
<p>A year later, however, the local media are scratching their heads in wonderment about what has been happening right under their noses. And the same Homeland Security and law enforcement officials who had taken a laissez faire approach to these fundraising and recruiting events are finally reexamining these activities. One Homeland Security official I spoke with last week even cited last year&rsquo;s Minneapolis event as one of the tipping points in radicalizing certain segments of the local Somali community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the past year developments within the Somali terrorist organizations have resulted in splits and fractionalization, with the most radical element, al-Shabaab, the former armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union movement, breaking away and forging closer alliances with al-Qaeda. As a result, Somalia is quickly becoming a new safe haven for al-Qaeda. Al-Shabaab and its leaders were designated a terrorist organization by the State Department back in March.</p>
<p>The most specific concern of Homeland Security officials about the departure of Somalis and other American Muslims for the terror training camps in Somalia is not that they will be killed, as was Minneapolis suicide bomber Shirwa Ahmed, but that they will get trained in the Somali terrorist camps and return home to wage jihad against the U.S. from within.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MEMRI has translated a video that recently appeared on numerous Somali websites &mdash; many of them run from the U.S. &mdash; in which al-Shabaab called on Americans and Europeans to join the jihad in Somalia. The video directly threatens Americans with extermination:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling the kuffar [infidels], the English people, the American people&hellip;&nbsp.; We&rsquo;re coming for you! We&rsquo;re going to exterminate you all!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Back here in the U.S., many of these sentiments can be heard in many mosques preaching violence and hatred towards America, the country which gave hundreds of thousands of Somalis refuge. {snip}</p>
<p>In Columbus, several mosques openly preach against America and encourage jihad. One mosque, Masjid Omar Ibn el-Khattab, nearby the Ohio State University campus, was the center of the largest known al-Qaeda cell in the U.S. since 9/11. {snip}</p>
<p>Another U.S. citizen, Ruben Luis Shumpert, an ex-convict Seattle barber and Muslim convert, was killed in Somalia earlier this year while fighting with al-Shabaab. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Why Homeland Security and FBI officials have been so slow to respond to this growing threat remains unanswered.</p>
<p>One area they are beginning to take action in is with the flow of funds from the U.S. to Somalia. {snip} The Columbus Dispatch reported two weeks ago that banks in the Columbus area, which is home to the second largest Somali population in the U.S. behind Minneapolis, are closing accounts for these U.S.-based hawala operations concerned about their inability to track where exactly the money goes after the transfer overseas.</p>
<p>Amazingly, however, Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman and his Somali staff liaison, Abdirizak Farah, are pressuring the local banks to create alternatives to keep the money flowing back to Somalia.</p>

		<p>I live in a Canadian city that has average monthly temperatures below freezing for 5 months of the year, and it&rsquo;s currently 20 below zero. Like other western cities, we&rsquo;ve had an influx of Somalis&hellip; no more to say on that subject! Today, I was at my dentist&rsquo;s, and he told me that many people are complaining about the winter cold, with one exception: the Somalis! I was flabbergasted - wouldn&rsquo;t &#8216;refugees&rsquo; from equatorial Africa find Canadian winters tough to deal with? But my dentist told me that they say that they much prefer cold to hot temperatures, such as what they experienced in Somalia. Apparently, they find it &#8216;refreshing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So on a side note, don&rsquo;t expect cold weather to chase them out of Canada, Minneapolis, Lewiston (Maine), Columbus (Ohio), Scandinavia, and other northern locales. From what they say (assuming they&rsquo;re telling the truth), they actually like frigid temperatures. With the weather no longer on our side, we&rsquo;ll have to rely on the lure of jihad to tempt them to leave their welfare benefits behind and return to their beloved Somalia. Of course, rather than relying on &#8216;other factors&rsquo;, such as the weather and Somalis&rsquo; own cultural deficiencies, we could always take action ourselves and drive them out of our lands. But that&rsquo;s a pipe dream. If we could do what we wanted to do, white flight would never have happened - it would have been the &#8216;others&rsquo; who would have been forced to flee.</p>

		<p>Is this really surprising, I have come in contact with immigrants in this country who have absolute hate and contempt for America and Americans and they aren&rsquo;t shy in showing it (and surprise, they ain&rsquo;t all mexicans). Oh, they will say all the right things to immigration officials, but once they land here their real feelings come out and the insane, gullible, greedy US government has seen fit to allow them to live in this country among us.</p>

		<p>And they&rsquo;re surprised by this?  To paraphrase the former Mexican President, where there is a Somalian, there is Somalia.</p>
<p>My first thought was that these young men were being sequestered to recount Coleman-Franken ballots.</p>

		<p>The USA government runs a special foreign terrorist training Program.  The program takes primitive, clueless, Muslims, with almost total lack of knowledge of Western culture and English, and imports them into the USA.  There they receive social services support for years while they learn the English language, American culture and customs, and technology.  These new skills become very, very useful to them later on, when they do perform their terrorist acts. Your taxes are paying for this special terrorist training program. </p>
<p>In the future, hundreds of Americans will die (perhaps someone from you family), in a terrorist act committed by one of the hundreds of thousands of Muslims or other Third World &#8220;refugees&#8221; brought to your community by the USA government. Oh, by the way, a different branch of our government is also spending your tax money to monitor these immigrants, to harden possible attack sites, and to otherwise prepare for terrorist attacks.  Hence, taxpayers are being billed twice (once to import and train terrorists and again to counter them).  We will also get to pay yet a third time: to clean up after the next terrorists attack.   </p>

		<p>The Somalis do not have the strength in numbers to practice Jihad here in the US, but with time they will turn their religious fervor towards those Christian infidels living in the US.</p>

		<p>They can leave the U.S. to be trained as terrorists, or stay here and kill dumb Whites, either way is better than assimilation, since &#8220;assimilation&#8221;means that we become more like them.  </p>

Somalis comming to the U.S. for Jihad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>From my local point of view, I bumped into this story the other night. <br>
Though it is from October, it is only about 5km (2-3 miles) away from me now.<br>
I had no idea we had Somalis so close to me here, it&rsquo;s a club I do not wish to be a member of (the &#8216;we have Somalis too club&rsquo;) .<br>
My area is mostly Middle Eastern, see story for how they&rsquo;re getting along.<br>

		<p>If they&rsquo;re playing dumb about their members leaving to train for jihad, let&rsquo;s play dumb about getting to them first before they attack us. </p>
<p>&#8220;concern of Homeland Security officials&hellip;departure of Somalians and other American Muslims&hellip;.not that they will be killed&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that just pisses me off! Homeland Security, enemies, hello! <br>
The idea that they might be killed, like it is a secondary concern, should not bother our officials. <br>
Make a choice. Live with the consequences. This is non-stop war. That&rsquo;s all their lives will ever be. If they have the upperhand, their jihad is physical attacks. If they don&rsquo;t have the upperhand, their jihad is economic and financial gain for future attacks. They&rsquo;re always against us! And we should be concerned about their safety? </p>

		<p>Seriously, who&rsquo;s bright idea was it to let Somalis into the US?<br>
How does that benefit America in any way? Big companies stand to benefit? That&rsquo;s not a good enough reason because they have an almost limitless pool of latinos to fill job needs and those latinos are a lot more law-abiding and their culture is a heck of a lot more compatible than that of a Somali.</p>

<p>In nature, showing passiveness stimulates aggression in others.  You can&rsquo;t run from a fight; either you defend your territory or you shuffle off into extinction.</p>
