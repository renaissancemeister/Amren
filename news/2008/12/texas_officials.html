<h1>Texas Officials Ask Obama to Stop Border Fence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Elected officials in El Paso are asking President-elect Barack Obama to scuttle federal plans to build hundreds of miles of fencing along the U.S. border with Mexico.</p>
<p>In a three-page letter to Obama dated Wednesday, officials from El Paso argue that the fence, a project approved by Congress in 2006, was ill-conceived and is an irresponsible expense while the country is in the midst of a recession.</p>
<p>State Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, who has long opposed the project, said he believed existing fencing, including several miles of decades old barriers in El Paso, Nogales, Ariz., and San Diego, should also be removed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both Obama and [Senator] Clinton voted for the Secure Border Act, which authorized fence construction. [Governor] Napolitano has been skeptical of the plan, suggesting that a border fence would likely only create a cottage industry for ladders.</p>

		<p>On the contrary&hellip;.the border fence is an excellent candidate for the massive infrastructure stimulus Mr. Obama has promised. It is &#8220;dirt ready&#8221; and can be continued without delay. It promises to employ people and pay wages. And it stimulates one of the parts of the country where unemployment is a problem.</p>
<p>Far from being a bad idea during a recession&hellip;..it is a better idea now, than it was before.<br/>

<p>So building a wall is too expensive, but tearing it down is not?  If the wall is &#8220;ill-conceived&#8221; because it doesn&rsquo;t work as well as hoped for (surely it can&rsquo;t make illegal immigration worse), what&rsquo;s the harm in leaving one up that&rsquo;s already built?</p>
<p>No one is sincere in this debate, nor did Bush ever intend to build the wall.  He bided his time long enough to let his successor strip funding from the project, which may very well have been his intent all along.  Obama may officially de-fund it, but it was Bush who effectively killed it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen pictures on the internet of parts of the fence.</p>
<p>One style is corrugated metal sheets about 8 by 4 ft.  If the corrugated furrows were placed vertically, the fence would be fine.  But the furrows are placed horizontally.  The furrows provide perfect foot holds every 6 inches for anyone who wants to climb over.</p>
<p>The other is bollards placed about 3ft apart.  Perfect for keeping vechicles out.  But all a smuggler has to do is drive a bus up to the fence on each side.  The illegals get out of one bus, walk through the bollards and board the other bus.</p>
<p>As soon as Obama is sworn in we can anticipate a sort of grayhound bus station on the American side of the border, with express buses leading to Chicago, New York, DC, Denver and other cities.</p>

<p>When the recession deepens these same officials are going to lose a lot of bribe money if a fence is in place, because right now they&rsquo;re allowing drug trucks to pass unimpeded, but if a fence is up their supplemental income will be gone. </p>

		<p>An impossible expense during a recession? Well, suppose we DENY all benefits of any kind, including educational and healthcare benefits to illegals and their families. Those savings would more than pay for the cost of the fence. They cost us $80 to $90 BILLION a year. Money that could be used to provide affordable healthcare insurance for AMERICAN families. Not for criminal illegal aliens to get a free ride at our expense.</p>

<p>A cottage industry for ladders? Great! If we specify that they all be made in the USA, it can only be a boon to the economy!</p>
<p>All jesting aside, if Napolitano advocated serious penalties for employers who hire illegals and other measures to stop illegal immigration, her &#8220;concerns&#8221; might have some credibility. As it is, I suspect her actual concern is that the fence will be all too effective. </p>
<p>I see from Wikipedia she&rsquo;s also President-elect Barack Obama&rsquo;s nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security. That says it all.</p>

		<p>The money required for the fence is less than a drop in the bucket compared with the trillions that congress is throwing around with their rescue plans. The pittance needed to finish a double layer fence will pay a thousand fold return on the investment. Maybe interrupting the illegal activity is why El Paso now has a gripe? I&rsquo;ve heard the fence is working VERY WELL in their neighborhood.</p>
<p>Sorry, El Paso, but pretend for a moment that you are still part of the United States and get on board with solving the problem.  The best possible rescue plan for the American economy is to first stop the bleeding. Stopping the crime of illegal entry is the priority because it prevents all the crimes that follow the first.  </p>
<p>I say build that fence, double layer, and every inch of it over the entire 3000 miles.   </p>

		<p>It looks like Obama is going to follow in the footsteps of Bush when it comes to uncontrolled immigration. This despite the will of the American people.  He has appointed Ariz. Gov. Napolitano, an open border advocate, to head Homeland Security and Cecilia Munoz as a close advisor who is a longtime member of La Raza and a very strong advocate of open borders.  EVEN a cascual observer can see  the dramatic change in America due to the uncontrolled immigration. This change has been anything but good for America and has been and continues to be VERY EXPENSIVE. This is to say nothing of the impact this invasion has on the American culture.<br/>
So Much for the will of the American people!</p>

		<p>The fence is not only an infrastructure project, as several commenters have said, it is even an ideal infrastructure project compared to road-building, bridges, subway tunnels and the like.<br/>
-no real estate must be acquired,<br/>
-no engineering or other type of planning is necessary,<br/>
-it can be erected by unskilled labor.<br/>
They could begin next week.</p>

		<p>OK, according to this guy it is a BAD idea to provide jobs to unemployed Americans to build a fence during a recession.  </p>
<p>On the other hand it is a GOOD idea to bring in a million under-educated, non-English speaking workers each year to compete for ever dwindling USA jobs, and to tax American citizens in order to pay for the medical care, housing, food stamps, policing, and incarceration of these illegal invaders, and the education of their children.  Meanwhile, we&rsquo;re supposed to simply suck up the dozens of exotic Third World diseases that these guys bring and the 100+ traffic accidents that are caused by uninsured illegals every day in America?  Finally, at a time when we need to keep every Dollar in the community   &mdash;   so each Dollar can circulate and improve the local economy   &mdash;   we have illegals sending billions of Dollars out of the USA and back to their home countries each year.    </p>
<p>This guy is an idiot! This guy doesn&rsquo;t give a d  &mdash;  - about America!<br/>
If Senior Shapleigh loves Mexicans so much more than Americans, then he should run for office in Nogalas or Cuiadad Juarez.</p>

		<p>The whole illegal immigration battle is a joke and I believe lost cause for those fighting against it. Why? Because the system has been rigged to facilitate the invasion.</p>
<p>1) Judges overturn the votes of the citizenry. Prop 187 in California and several in Arizona by Napolitano. </p>
<p>2)The schools are full of anchor babies who have been declared legal. This muddies up the water on what to do with the parents.</p>
<p>3)Millions of illegal aliens are working with a tax number, giving the endless number of attorneys in this nation a way to defend their right to be here. &#8220;They&rsquo;ve paid taxes,etc.</p>
<p>4)An overwhelming number of hispanic ethnic interest groups, backed by an enormous number of traitorous attornys can endlessly tie up laws that try to get rid of illegal aliens. Witness the struggles in Los Angeles to try to just get rid of illegal alien gang members, never mind other illegals. </p>
<p>For any progress to be achieved on illegal immigration, all of the points above and many more would have to be dismantled and no one is even attempting this. On the illegal immigration invasion from Mexico, and considering the complacency of the vast majority of Americans, I believe we are doomed.</p>

		<p>Commissar Obama has already said that his first actions will be to make health care and good housing available to every person in the USA.  It turns out that virtually NONE of the 1 to 2 million illegal aliens who invade our nation each year have either health care or own a USA home.  As sure as salmonella on Mexican spinach, you can bet that the &#8220;wealthy&#8221; (i.e., anyone who has a job) will be taxed to provide these &#8220;rights&#8221; to our new neighbors. </p>
<p>The reason both you and your spouse will need to work 50 hrs a week and the reason that you will not be able to afford to have more children, is because large amounts of money will be taken from your paycheck to provide health care and housing to the very large families of illegal aliens.   When you add up all of your taxes and fees (including gasoline, property, sales, phone, utility, travel, hotel, tolls, &amp; assorted other fees, charges, &amp; taxes), most of us already pay over 50% of our income in taxes.  When will it stop?  Will it stop when the government takes 75%?  90%?  95% of our income? </p>

		<p>Letting these people in the US provides a safety valve for the White government in Mexico so they don&rsquo;t have to do any reforms.  This is one reason the US Government and Bush look the other way at the expense of the American middle class.  The best thing that could possible happen for us is a collapse of the Calderon government and a Hugo Chavez type character siezing power spouting anti-Americanism and making threats.  US officials would have no choice but to militarize the border and deport Mexicans for security reasons. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure President-elect Obama will comply. In one of his recent speeches he said it would be UNFAIR to deport illegal aliens. Unfair to whom, Mr. Obama? Why is there ever a discussion about this? Illegal means unlawful. Ignoring this fact, and the millions - maybe 20+ illegal aliens - in this country, is a crime in itself. Since politicians can never be accused of altruism, it has to be for votes or payoffs. 40  pieces (pesos)of silver must be going for a lot more these days. Oh, I forgot another reason for this anarchy. Could be that they prefer low-skilled, poorly educated criminals to lawful, taxpaying, patriotic citizens. they have a choice and it seems it&rsquo;s NOT us.</p>

		<p><i>What would their excuse be absent a recession?</i></p>
<p>Whichever one would give them cover for their true motives, however thinly (to answer your rhetorical question).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the immigration issue: we are told we should continue to accept immigrants because we accepted many in the past; Ireland is told to accept them because it <i>sent</i> many in the past.  Or there&rsquo;s a labor shortage.  Or an aging population.  No matter what reasoning is used, or where, the same answer always seems to result!  Funny how that works.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s puzzling that a local politician would argue against a local project that is guaranteed to bring jobs and money into his town or state.  That would ordinarily be seen as political malpractice.  Could there be another agenda at work here?</p>
<p>Another thing I find puzzling is that &#8220;elected officials&#8221; can presume to stop a federal project.  This is like the mayor of a small town writing to the federal DOT to stop an interstate highway project  &mdash;  -it just doesn&rsquo;t work that way!</p>

		<p>I suppose this politician is not concerned about all the drug murders that have occured just across the border from his town.  If nothing else a fence would help prevent that from spilling across the border.  It seems that this guy doesn&rsquo;t care that more of his constituents might become victims of violent crimes if the fence is not built.  There is no comprehensible reason for this guy not to be in support of building the fence except that someone is paying him off.</p>

<p>I live near El Paso and guess who is building the fence?  Yes, Mexicans!  The same Mexicans we are building the fence to keep out of our country!  And guess who is patrolling our border with Mexico?  That&rsquo;s right, Mexicans are patrolling our border with Mexico.  The minute men have not helped at all.  I have news for you all, the South Western United States is already controlled by Mexicans.  The Whites that live there have assimilated to the Mexican culture.  Most of us  speak Spanish, eat Mexican foods and there are a lot of us marrying into Mexican families.  My cousin has a  Quinceañera! (That is when they have this huge party for a girl on her  15th birthday.  I don&rsquo;t much more about it.)  West Texas and Southern New Mexico is like another country.  I have been living in this area all my life and I have seen it change into a whole other country right before my eyes.   My point is, building a fence is not going to stop them from coming into our country.  We would only be giving employment to the very people we don&rsquo;t want to come into our country.  </p>

<p>John, you are exaggerating somewhat. I have a lot of friends including as you say a few married to Mexicans. I can&rsquo;t think of one who can speak Spanish. As for eating Mexican foods, this has been common in California and the Southwest for a long time, when there was literally a handfull of Mexicans here then compared to now. Mexican restaurant chains have existed for 50 years. It is true many Anglos are marrying into Mexican families in the Southwest, and I think one reason is that so many Anglos have literally left areas in the Southwest, that Mexicans are about the only women many meet. In general though, I would agree with much of your post. That is why I said that as far as the fight against illegal immigration goes, WE&rsquo;RE DOOMED.</p>
