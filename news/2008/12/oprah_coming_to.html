<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Oprah Winfrey, who gave President-elect Barack Obama a crucial boost during the early primaries, is celebrating his Inauguration by bringing her powerhouse television show to Washington for the week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During Obama&rsquo;s acceptance speech the night he won, tears streamed down Winfrey&rsquo;s cheeks as she leaned on an Obama campaign worker.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are not even words to talk about what this night means,&#8221; Winfrey told Maria Menounos of &#8220;Access Hollywood&#8221; that night. &#8220;Everybody keeps using the word &lsquo;historic.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s never been a night like this on the planet Earth&hellip;&nbsp;. Nothing can compare to this.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Way to alienate even more of your white viewers, Oprah! I&rsquo;m sure they still haven&rsquo;t forgotten your endorsement of Obama over Hillary.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Everybody keeps using the word &lsquo;historic.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s never been a night like this on the planet Earth&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Uh, I think what the term &#8220;historic&#8221; means is that it is <i>creating</i> history. But never mind. That isn&rsquo;t true either. One only has to look at Zimbabwe and a number of other African nations to see the precedent.</p>

		<p>&#8220;During Obama&rsquo;s acceptance speech the night he won, tears streamed down Winfrey&rsquo;s cheeks as she leaned on an Obama campaign worker.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I am sure, that Obama campaign worker was white!</p>
<p>There is no worse symbol of what is wrong with this country, than the ongoing suburban white cult of Oprah. Not even the cult of Obama is as bad, since in the mid-1980s, he was but a germinating threat engaged in &#8220;community organizing.&#8221; She on the other hand, has been pushing her anti-white poison into the heads of millions of stupid white women and adoring homosexuals for more than two decades.  </p>
<p>Remember that atrocity, &#8220;The Color Purple?&#8221; </p>
<p>Talk about a &#8220;white guilt&#8221; extravaganza!</p>
<p>And across her &#8220;talk show&#8221; (more like  gibberish instructions) career, she has done little more than lash out at whites and make fools of them as best she can; for example, turning the drawling &#8220;psychologist&#8221; Dr. Phil into her whore-boy of white debasement. And all the while, the &#8220;progressive&#8221; white fools of this country, have applauded her vile antics, simply because she, like the mulatto &#8220;savior,&#8221; was only &#8220;slightly&#8221; antagonistic when spewing the hate. </p>
<p>You see, that is the key to her and Comrade BO&rsquo;s successes, they offer the witchdoctor&rsquo;s &#8220;medicine&#8221; with just enough obsequiously grinning and glad-handed sugar to make it go down just right, for the most neutered members of the white race.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>What is going to be planetary news is the coming eclipse of the USA by the East Asian juggernaut. A shift in power from &#8220;us&#8221; to &#8220;them&#8221;; from a sense of exceptionalism to a sense of mediocrity, from a pursuit of excellence to a struggle for survival. I always thought our culture was uneasy with its superiority, given that the elites made the common man in this country defend its power plays all over the globe as a price to be paid for that sense. Anyway, we are in for a humbling time. That use of the word &#8220;we&#8221; does not include the Obamamaniacs because many of them so hate the USA that they desire its relegation to second class status. However, after a while, once the spasm of hatred satisfied wears off, once the country as a whole discovers once again what most of the world knows - that it is much better to be rich than poor, and that advantage lost might never be gained back, and that the problems of the USA economy might well be insoluble - the sobriety will be breathtaking. I think Oprah will go out of business.</p>

		<p>If Oprah said it then you can be fairly sure it ranks right around the intellectual level and general world view of perhaps a ninth grader. Please explain to me how this inauguration is historic. Are you UFOs going to appear. Will the Heavens part? It&rsquo;s a swearing ceremony for an inexperienced political hack attended by hundreds of thousands of his racist and government-dependent bothers and sisters - at least the ones not incarcerated.</p>
<p>More like anti-historic.</p>
<p>But, we can&rsquo;t give up. To borrow a line from the Jews - &#8220;Never Again.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Actually she&rsquo;s quite right - there likely never has been a, &#8220;night like this on this planet.&#8221; Never before has so absolutely much been made of so astonishingly little! Again, Black symbolism over substance. Only this time fully encouraged, manipulated and cheer-lead by much of brainwashed White America. </p>
<p>Some, even in the mainstream, though are starting to question whether or not the Mulatto Messiah can possibly live up to these unprecedented and obviously unrealistic expectations. I hear more murmering about it each day. Of course the dedicated sycophants are nowhere near prepared to let up in their cultish adulation any time soon - but I already see and hear doubt filtering through the cracks. I suspect even the devout may jump on-board in time, as they realize NO ONE could live uo this hype and thus, their savior may well come to be just another false prophet after all. And we can be sure they will make very certain that that conclusion is headed-off at the proverbial pass lonf before it can even be formally suggested in the mainstream! <br>

		<p>Somehow, I think that the media tried to &#8220;grease&#8221; the way for a bantu president, by keeping the likes of Winfrey on the air for some 23 years or so. The cult-like fawning over her by Caucasian females is sickening. Heck, my own mother practically worships the ground she walks on!</p>
<p>ABC tried to grease the notion of a female president a couple of years ago, with its short-lived series &#8220;Commander in Chief&#8221;, starring Geena Davis. That was at a time when Hillary Clinton was widely viewed as the front-runner for the Democrat nomination for president.</p>
<p>To mark:</p>
<p>Your post is thought-provoking. It isn&rsquo;t so much the culture that was &#8220;uneasy&#8221; with its superiority, but the POLITICIANS IN POWER, who were ill at ease. This started right after World War II with the Cold War. The Berlin blockade easing in 1948, the Korean War in 1950, the Lebanese adventure, (1958), the Bay of Pigs (1962), the beginnings of the Vietnam War under Kennedy are all examples of this unease.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the USA was exporting its culture all over the world, starting with the proliferation of television satellites, Kennedy&rsquo;s &#8220;Peace Corps&#8221;(which I always thought was a way for Kennedy to ease &#8220;volunteers&#8221; into the Vietnam War, at least the gung-ho spirit), even with Coca-Cola (&#8220;I&rsquo;d like to teach the world to sing&hellip;.&#8221;), and motion pictures.</p>
<p>I agree Winfrey will be out of business, but not before she drapes herself around Obama like some flag. She&rsquo;ll still have her billions though.  </p>

		<p>  Who elected Oprah anyway? I&rsquo;ve never understood the cloying sentimental Oprah cult among affluent middle class white women. What real talent does she actually have? Can she sing? Can she paint? Can she write? We know she can&rsquo;t act. Oprah is a creation of her Chicago media handlers. Without them, she would be stamping tax forms in some obscure government office in DC.</p>

		<p>  I believe it was all the oprah viewers that voted for obammy. I&rsquo;ve never seen so many white people look to a man of color as a god of some sort. It is truly shameful. Alot of people are on the other side of the coin, they view him as the anti-christ. Is Kenya considered part of the middle-east? I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the anti-christ, he could never hold that much precedence. I consider him a charlatan. He is an empty suit that the left will use to fulfill their communist agenda. If you resist, you will be branded a racist. I have lost all faith in both parties, the government, and almost all religions. My fellow man is no longer my fellow man. I will watch my back amongst all people. Even amy own white race cannot be trusted, as witnessed on election day. But I guess it is entirely their fault. From birth to the grave, we are now inundated constantly with multiculti garbage. It would appear that the impressionable whites are finding it harder to resist the propaganda. This country will get just what it asked for. It will become a third world dump, just what the left wanted all along. </p>

		<p>Jay Leno said last night on his show, when he was interviewing NBC&rsquo;s Brian Williams, that Obama was his biggest fear, &#8220;He&rsquo;s too perfect, how can you make fun of him&#8221;? Apparently this was not meant to be a joke. More a PC style explanation for why comedians aren&rsquo;t making fun of Obama.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said that when liberals finally take complete control, they are going to at least make some common sense reforms. From television, to newsprint, to academia, to local government, this has not turned out to be true in any way. Apparently, it will only be when white folks act-out/need help that they will return to something close to sanity.</p>
<p>Liberals have presented a united front against child predators at least&hellip; Now, instead of 1st graders needing to know their phone number, their address, and that policemen are their friend, now millions of toddlers must know how to recognize a sexual predator as part of their schooling, and the steps to outsmart one or fight one off. Who would object to progress? I guess for a liberal mind, this all passes for sanity.   </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing, isn&rsquo;t it? My entire family voted for Obama. My underage nephews run around in Obama T-shirts. They went to see The One when he made a local appearance and they were all agog because they got to shake Obama&rsquo;s hand. They all think it would be great if Obama restored the &#8220;assault weapons&#8221; ban, not that any of them know the first thing about assault weapons. My brother-in-law, a fifty-year-old man, has been following Obama&rsquo;s cabinet appointments in a state of high excitement. The thought of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State makes him quiver like a teenage girl at a Beatles concert.  Don&rsquo;t ask me why. </p>
<p>Needless to say, I have to keep my mouth shut at all times to avoid getting into meaningless arguments with these loons. None of them have any idea about what is going on, and I mean that literally. They don&rsquo;t pay much attention to the news, but when they do, their main source of information is network TV and they don&rsquo;t even remember most of that. This Obama cult is purely emotional as far as I can tell. Voting for a black makes them all warm and fuzzy. During the primaries, my 85-year-old mother was torn between voting for Hillary or Obama. She said she&rsquo;d always wanted to vote for either a woman or a black. Forget the &#8220;issues.&#8221; Race and sex  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s as far as this goes. </p>
<p>If you ask me, this is all the result of mass-market advertising, the most effective form of conditioning ever invented. Most whites have been hopelessly brainwashed and dumbed-down, and they&rsquo;re incredibly susceptible to mass-media and marketing campaigns. The Obama craze is a classic example. Take my nephews, for instance. They&rsquo;re too young to know anything about politics. They&rsquo;re crazy about Obama for the same reason they were crazy about Harry Potter or Bat Man. That&rsquo;s really all it amounts to, and the same thing applies to the adults. The campaigns spend millions on advertising because it works. It&rsquo;s really amazing.</p>

<p>Soprano fan you are so right.  </p>
<p>I always thought commander in chief was simply hitlery for pres propaganda.  Oprah stole her entire show from Phil Donahue.  She got all her jobs from affirmative action.  When she stole Donahue&rsquo;s format, somehow she took off. I assume with enormous help from the TV channels.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they manipulated to ratings to make her a star and get sponsors.</p>
<p>Ever looked at her magazine?  A rehash of every mediocre women&rsquo;s magazine of the last 200 years.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for the National Enquirer pictures of her in her gaudy, over the top inaugural ball gown.</p>
<p>TV and movies are nothing but liberal propaganda.  A few years ago just about every prime time sit com was gay propaganda. </p>
<p>Since we invaded Iraq hollywood has come out with an anti american pro islamic terrorist movie every year.  No one goes to see them.  No one rents the videos.  Reese Witherspoon starred in Rendition.  She is the highest paid female star.  She has the biggest fan base. Her young woman fan base brings in their husbands, boyfriends and children.  But even with Reese, no one saw rendition. It died after a couple weeks.</p>
<p>But the media and hollywood persist in their anti american, anti white agenda.  And they are very successful<br>

		<p>I have always wondered if it is really true that Oprah&rsquo;s biggest fan base is white women.  Oprah is a daytime show for people who don&rsquo;t work the regular monday to friday 8-5 hours.</p>
<p>White women have a very high work force participation.  Most people work the regular day time hours.  Presumably some hospital and other 24/7 shift white women work nights and watch Oprah in the afternoon, but the majority of workers work days.</p>
<p>So which race has the most idle welfare mommas paid by the taxpayers to raise thug criminal children and lounge about on the couch all day?  Black women.</p>
<p>Which race + gender occupies government office desks with tiny portable TVs where they can watch TV all day while pretending to work? Black women  When I worked in a black female government office a lot of them watched Oprah, the soaps and even brought DVDs to watch at &#8220;work&#8221;, aka better paid welfare.</p>
<p>It is well known in the media that of all the races blacks watch the most television. That&rsquo;s why so many ads are directed at blacks.  That&rsquo;s why there are so many black sit coms.  Blacks are TVs biggest and most faithful audience, especially of daytime TV.</p>
<p>So it is entirely possible that her big fan base is not suburban white women but welfare and night shift black women.</p>
<p>White married women who don&rsquo;t work tend to be married to wealthy white men.  They are well educated upper middle class people.  I doubt they are Oprah couch potatoes.  They are probably on the country club golf course, volunteering as guides at the local museum or at the local University doing research for a PHD when Oprah is on. </p>

<p>Posted by John PM at 6:41 PM on December 4</p>
<p>I remember years ago when Oprah was in the same general group as Geraldo, Jerry Springer, and Jenny Jones a particularly blatant anti-white male show. The topic involved interracial relationships. The white gentleman should of known better than appearing on the show but it was obvious he still had feelings for his attractive blonde haired ex. She was sitting arm and arm with her new black lover who lived in the same building as all involved. The show was just a furious assualt on white maleness. The poor guy was dragged through the dirt. It was revealed he at one time had used the &#8220;N&#8221; word-oooh. The attractive blonde also stated that her new black stud could fulfill her completely unlike the white guy. Oprah also tellingly revealed that interracial relationships don&rsquo;t upset her. </p>

		<p>DC plans coronation festivities:</p>
<p>Millions of Drunken Obama Kool-Aid Drinkers Expected to Invade Washington D.C. for Inauguration Week. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea&hellip; Let&rsquo;s Extend Bar-Time to 5am so they can get Absolutely Plastered on the Good Stuff What could go wrong? </p>
<p>Hoping to tap in to an inaugural bonanza, the D.C. Council Tuesday night voted in favor of extending last call to 5 a.m. and allow bars and restaurants to serve food around the clock during inauguration week. Millions of visitors are expected to descend on the city to celebrate Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidential swearing-in on Jan. 20. The council hopes to accommodate the throng by&hellip; </p>
<p>Maybe the whole mess will end up like the Walmart stampede.</p>

		<p>      The path for Obama was begun decades ago. He is the &#8220;Tan<br>
Man&#8221; extolled by UNESCO and destined to replace all other races.<br>
He bears an uncanny likeness to the resourceful mulatto star of<br>
&#8220;Night of the Living Dead&#8221;. Truly Whites are becoming Zombies who<br>
are easy to rule and convenient to kill. </p>

		<p>Winfrey apparently forgot about the astronauts reaching the moon on July 20, 1969; the election of Obama is not the greatest event in the planet&rsquo;s history -that would be Jesus Christ (in MHO). Even the breakup of the USSR is of far greater significance and importance.</p>
<p>To the poster at 6;21PM:</p>
<p>If what you say is correct, the Obama inauguration could resemble a &#8220;Juneteenth&#8221; or &#8220;Black Freakweek&#8221; on a colossal scale. I can see shots being fired, riots breaking out, cops clubbing people and the National Guard being deployed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s chilling to bring this up, but I would not be surprised one iota, if a terrorist attack occurred in D.C. - the perps taking advantage of police being deployed at one location, while they strike at another. I&rsquo;m not talking about Caucasian skinhead or militia groups here- I&rsquo;m talking about Mid-East groups. I hope I&rsquo;m wrong on that score.</p>
<p>I would also not be surprised if a lot of military coups are staged across Africa that day. Presumably, a lot of black heads of state will attend his inauguration - it would be the right time for a coup- since many of them are carried out when the big bwana is out of the country.</p>
<p>I will not watch one second of the inauguration. Life is too short.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Obama craze is a classic example. Take my nephews, for instance. They&rsquo;re too young to know anything about politics&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Excellent post and SO true!  This Obama hype reminds me of when the Beatles came to town (in my case, Toronto, Canada)&hellip;  I was too young to know much about rock n&rsquo; roll bands (just a kid) but made a point of listening to their performance and all of the hype on the radio with my best friend just because it was the &#8220;cool&#8221; thing to do&hellip;  </p>
<p>I wonder how long this Obama Craze will stay &#8220;cool&#8221;&hellip;<br>

<p> As I recall didn&rsquo;t the &#8216;resourceful mulatto&rsquo; get two people killed in a hare-brained scheme to get gas in that film? And wasn&rsquo;t the &#8220;evil bad guy&#8221; Harry actually RIGHT when he said to get into the cellar? And didn&rsquo;t the black guy eventually do exactly what Harry had said? What he had rained water on all movie long? Only to take Harry&rsquo;s advice - after he killed him? But of course black Ben was the &#8220;good guy&#8221; and White Harry was the &#8220;bad guy&#8221;. That&rsquo;s film-making for you.</p>

<p>*aHEM*</p>
<p>Excuse me, but yes there are. Quite a welter of them in fact.<br>
Most of them of course cannot be printed in respectable media, and the rest have been made essentially illegal to say, but dont be fooled. There ARE words to &#8220;talk about what (&hellip;describe?) this night means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Night&#8221;, however, is very suggestive, and very pregnant of meaning pertaining directly to this subject. Night-as in-Mare.<br>
Night as in eternal. Night as in &#8220;Going Quietly into the&hellip;&#8221;<br>
Night as in Our Ancestors worst nightmare come true.</p>

		<p>&#8220;White married women who don&rsquo;t work tend to be married to wealthy white men. They are well educated upper middle class people. I doubt they are Oprah couch potatoes. They are probably on the country club golf course, volunteering as guides at the local museum or at the local University doing research for a PHD when Oprah is on.&#8221;</p>
<p>  Think again, many of these well off white women make time for watching Oprah. I know this from unfortunate personal experience. The wealthy women watch Oprah along with their maids and cleaning ladies. My late mother (may she rest in peace) used to watch Oprah, and my rich sister-in-law has been to Chicago for a &#8220;live&#8221; show. This is part of general cultural decline. </p>

		<p>Tired of the whole Obama fever.You&rsquo;d think he was the second coming of the Messiah. </p>
<p>Considering that many blacks were going crazy when he won,it would make me think they are racist,I mean,surely they aren&rsquo;t saying that being black makes him a better candidate (detect sarcasm).</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor guy was dragged through the dirt. It was revealed he at one time had used the &ldquo;N&rdquo; word-oooh. The attractive blonde also stated that her new black stud could fulfill her completely unlike the white guy. Oprah also tellingly revealed that interracial relationships don&rsquo;t upset her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes sir, I remember that kind of idiotic bunk from the now &#8220;sacred&#8221; cow of chatter that is Oprah in the late 80s.</p>
<p>My two personal favorites were:</p>
<p>1.) The time she announced that she would like to purchase the plantation her ancestors were slaves on, much to the hooting delight of her sub-moronic &#8220;audience;&#8221;</p>
<p>2.) The 60 Minutes interview where she informed her interviewer, that she always knew she was &#8220;destined for greatness,&#8221; and she mostly employed a white staff because she &#8220;expected excellence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course there are also recent gems like this:</p>

<p>Oh Dr. Phil, is you a &#8220;good white folks?&#8221;</p>
<p>It suffices to say, this wretched black witch has been banned form my homes&rsquo; televisions since about 1989/1990 when I was first on my own and in college. If anyone, be they friend or relative objected, they were always informed that they could &#8220;suffer&#8221; without her or leave!</p>

		<p>Actually it is about the letter &#8220;O&#8221;. Opera - Obama. See how similar the names are? Opera is little more than another Obama want a be and when Obama didn&rsquo;t need her support, he ignored her. How devastating to a woman of her statute [well, perceived statute].</p>
<p>Women tend to love Opera, since, irrespective of her wealth, she is just another black woman, well past her prime, struggling with her weight. Since when, and just, who made HER an authority on anything? Her in depth analysis is about as deep as a grape skin. </p>

		<p>Everyone is complaining about this and trying to get out of going.  Why do you think we live and work in Los Angeles?  To escape the snow and cold and sleet of January in DC.  We&rsquo;ll have to buy long underwear and wool socks.  We&rsquo;ll still freeze while being insulted as racist cops by every thug that comes for the party.</p>
<p>There will be of course, numerous lawsuits ensuing that we didn&rsquo;t treat the thugs like precious babies.  At least one deputy involved in the lawsuits will be hung out to dry by the LA board of supervisors.</p>
<p>How can I get out of this extra duty? </p>
<p><br>
LA TIMES ^ | 12/9/08<br>
What&rsquo;s a cross-country plane trip to help out a friend? If you&rsquo;re the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, county officials said today, it&rsquo;s an estimated $1.6-million proposition. </p>
<p>Police in Washington have asked for more than 340 L.A. County sheriff&rsquo;s deputies to make the trip East to assist them during next month&rsquo;s inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama. The plan to send deputies has irritated Los Angeles County supervisors, who have questioned why the police in D.C. haven&rsquo;t turned to departments closer to home. </p>
<p>They are also raising concerns about exactly how much of the out-of-pocket expenses and salary will be reimbursed&hellip;. </p>
