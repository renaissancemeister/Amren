<h1>Sarkozy Acts for Ethnic Diversity</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christine Ollivier, AP, December 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy, impatient with what he said was the slow pace of promoting diversity in France, announced measures Wednesday to put more ethnic minorities on TV screens, in political parties and in elite schools.</p>
<p>A government action plan to be presented by March will spell out the measures in detail. The project is to be overseen by a newly appointed commissioner for diversity and equality, Yazid Sabeg, a son of Algerian immigrants who is known for his efforts to bring equality to the workplace.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Turning to his audience, Sarkozy said prestigious schools must make room for all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He wants top schools to reserve 25 percent of their places for students receiving state aid by September &mdash; and 30 percent by September 2010. Many students who receive government education funds are ethnic minorities from underprivileged backgrounds.</p>
<p>Increasing diversity was a campaign promise of Sarkozy, elected in May 2007. Long ignored, diversity topped the political agenda after fall 2005 riots in poor French neighborhoods exposed deep anger among people of immigrant origin and revealed the extent of discrimination in France.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sarkozy squarely rejected affirmative action for France. But in a significant departure from French practice, he raised the possibility that scientists might begin gathering statistics on ethnicity &mdash; long taboo in a country that is officially colorblind.</p>
<p>Researchers are handicapped by the inability to make head counts based on religious or ethnic factors and have pressed for permission to do so. Sarkozy said scientists must be able &#8220;to clearly identify lagging and measure progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He encouraged companies to accept anonymous resumes from job seekers to avoid discrimination due to name or address as is often the case today.</p>
<p>The government will propose that 100 large companies experiment with using such resumes in 2009, Sarkozy said, adding that he wants to extend the reach of the High Authority Against Discrimination so that it has the right to make surprise checks of work places.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sarkozy also said TV stations will be required to spell out diversity goals to the CSA, France&rsquo;s audiovisual watchdog.<br>

<p>Sorry, old guy, but you&rsquo;re not going to stop them from rioting and torching cars en masse by giving them a brown face to look at on t.v.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re far ahead of you on that, going so far as to making them into godlike figures, and they&rsquo;ve just gotten worse.</p>
<p>Just forget about it, buy a large supply of weinies, buns, and marshmellows and sit back in front of the fires and enjoy yourselves.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to change the inevitable break up, so why not emtertain yourselves until the final flare up?</p>

		<p>And this Hungarian born Neo Conservative was touted as the tough, law and order strong man to end the Arab, Black riots in France and restore French pride and culture by ending Third World immigration to France.</p>
<p>I support Amrens policy of not scape goating a certain tribe for all of the problems confronting White Western Civilization.</p>
<p>But, everyone should understand that we can not allow lying Neo Conservatives to assume leadership of any White countries, or any important White institutions. Look what happened at National Review.</p>
<p>If they behave themselves and don&rsquo;t take extreme anti White, anti Western positions than this group should be left alone to enjoy the benefits of living in our countries.</p>
<p>But once the Neo Cons stab us in the back, go over to the other side and push anti White affirmative action, multi cult marxist programs to &#8220;Change&#8221; our societies, everyone should understand they are in the enemy, anti White camp.</p>
<p>Sarkozy should be deposed, his position in life should be selling cheap electronic devices in some Kiosk in Morocco.</p>

		<p>What a shock!  Sarkozy is not ethnically French.  He&rsquo;s Jewish, and his family emigrated to France from Greece.  No deep roots in the French soil for his family.  No wonder he doesn&rsquo;t see the value of preserving French culture and ethnicity.  Viva La Multiculturalism!</p>

		<p> So, Sarko was just another fake Neocon after all. He adopted some of Le Pen&rsquo;s positions to get elected, and then promptly forgot them. He&rsquo;s typical of our privileged elites. </p>

		<p>How very sad this all is! It&rsquo;s all so very unnatural.</p>
<p>I oftentimes think that the invention of television has been the greatest factor in the decline of the West.</p>
<p>Television, by its very nature   &mdash;   being pictures and sounds coming out of a &#8216;box&rsquo;   &mdash;   is fantasy, not immediate reality. In this sense, it is much like hallucinations and hypnosis. Because of its enormous power, it is the most potent propaganda tool ever devised.</p>
<p>I think that television may be the Frankenstein Monster created by the White man that may destroy his civilization in the end.</p>

		<p>  Shouldn&rsquo;t a Frenchman expect to be given preference in France ? Has the West gone mad ? Oh I forgot,if Idi Amin today claimed to be French, or American we&rsquo;d have to slap him on the back and welcome him to the proverbial melting pot as one of our own. </p>

<p>The above quote reads like something from [i]1984[/i]. According to the media, Africans torching cars, looting, and shooting at police MUST be because of discrimination by evil racist whites, case closed. Now I understand! Africans must mug white victims in the subways and go on &#8220;wilding&#8221; sprees on trains, beating up white men and sexually assaulting the women, because of racism as well.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t it be that people discriminate against Africans in part because of their propensity for violence and destruction?</p>

		<p>The human races and ethnicities were largely separated for millenia. The burden of proof therefore lies with the multi-cult promoters, like Sarkozy, in their assertion that this new social doctrine is morally superior. Had the races long been thoroughly mixed, they would not exist as we know them today. Therefore the push for more diversity seems to go against the grain of Nature. Whatever goes against Nature is, in my opinion, morally questionable, if not definitely wrong.</p>

		<p>This is what you get when you elect a foreigner as President.  How could Sarkozy advance or understand French culture when he is not even French himself?  But there&rsquo;s a good lesson here, riot loud enough and you&rsquo;ll get everything you want.  </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that why they call it &#8220;French&#8221; TV?</p>
<p>I swear I get so fed up with these people who go around acting like we&rsquo;d die without diversity when in fact it&rsquo;s really a source of conflict and tension and no one really wants it.</p>

		<p>Sarkozy claims he doesn&rsquo;t want &#8220;affirmative action&#8221;, yet, in the next breath; he wants set-asides of 25% for minorities at the top French schools.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, whose proponents swore up and down, that quota systems would NEVER be used.</p>

		<p>     Oh yeah, I saw a clip of that on TV, if it&rsquo;s the same law.<br>
Hubert Humphrey said he would eat the paper it was written on<br>
if this was ever used against White Men. Nobody cares about the<br>
past anymore. Just down the memory hole-like Kennedy&rsquo;s claim that<br>
the 1965 immigration act wouldn&rsquo;t change our nation. Without a<br>
true knowledge of our past, we have an impoverished present and<br>
no guidance as to the future.</p>
