			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Test results that show Puerto Rican students lagging far behind children on the U.S. mainland ignited debate Wednesday over the fairness of questions translated from English for a Spanish-speaking island with a distinct heritage and culture.</p>
<p>Puerto Rico&rsquo;s education department says the scores do not reflect its students&rsquo; abilities and wants an exemption from the National Assessment Educational Progress math exams, which are required as a condition of federal school funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a translation of the exam in the United States, and it doesn&rsquo;t match,&#8221; said Jose Rivera Melendez, an assistant education secretary. &#8220;There is a serious disconnect.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. education officials said the Spanish translation of the exam was vetted by Puerto Rican educators and linguists chosen by the local government. A Puerto Rican glossary was developed to ensure word problems on the math exam were accessible to island students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Spanish-speaking U.S. territory is exempt from the language exam.</p>
<p>Fourth- and eighth-grade students in Puerto Rico scored, on average, less than half as many correct answers as their peers on the U.S. mainland in the 2007 version of the exam, which is held every two years.</p>
<p>Island students skipped many of the questions on previous exams and were given 70 minutes this time to help them finish the test, compared with 50 minutes for students in the U.S., Carr said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In social and, mainly, educational terms, Puerto Rico is a different country, and the complexities of that different way of being in the world should be recognized,&#8221; Aragunde wrote in a letter last month to Carr.</p>
<p>The letter brought a quick rebuke from the island&rsquo;s governor-elect, Luis Fortuno, a conservative whose party wants Puerto Rico to become the 51st U.S. state.</p>

If PR becomes the 51st state, then Puerto Ricans wouldn&rsquo;t have to travel to and live in Central Florida in order to apply for and collect SSI.  Much better for for everyone involved if they could just stay home and collect welfare in their &#8220;own country.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is precisely why Puerto Rico should never be granted statehood.</p>

		<p>P.R. should be given its independence, whether it wants it or not. I can not think of one single thing America has ever gained from having the place. Foolish, stupid imperialism.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s right, in PR 2 plus 2 equals 5 and the world is flat.  How&rsquo;s this for a PR math problem?: If PR collects 132 million dollars in tax revenues and receives one billion dollars in benefits from Washington, DC, what is the net &#8220;to the good&#8221; for all of us jibaros?  </p>
<p>And as far as statehood is concerned, only people from Puerto Rico and the states of Mississippi, New Mexico, and West Virginia could perceive any benefit there. Those three states would move up a small click from the bottom of the fiscal and economic pile. I say cut &#8220;La Isla del Encanto&#8221; loose and let the separatists have it.</p>

		<p>Puerto Rico is a foreign country and should be cut loose from the USA.  Anyway George Bush has Africa lined up as the 51st state, and Mexico as the 52nd.  We just don&rsquo;t have time for PR.</p>

		<p>Interesting how the same leftists who mock the Bell Curve and scoff at IQ differences among the races give the Puerto Rican students 70 minutes to finish the exams that mostly white students have to finish in 50 minutes.   </p>

		<p>My comments are tow-pronged. First, how does one &#8216;translate&rsquo; a math problem? Does one use &#8216;Ã±&rsquo; instead of x, y, or z? And, if so, how would it matter? Is anything gained or lost, depending on the convention used? The naming of variables in mathematics is arbitrary to begin with, and one could just as easily use Greek upper or lower case letters without any loss of significance. Algebra and calculus are invariant in time and space.<br>
Secondly, speaking as one whose half-Puerto Rican, highly intelligent son (yes, his very blonde &#8216;guera&rsquo; mother was a Euro-Puerto Rican, of which there are many in PR, who holds two university degrees: half Spanish from Spain and half post-WWI immigrant French; Euro PRs comprise the near-entirety of the middle and upper classes there)is a second-year med student at Mt Sinai in NYC and who graduated in molecular biology undergrad, I can say that there are many, many other highly intelligent Puerto Ricans - nearly all of whom are of Euro extraction and who typically have Italian, French, Russian and other Euro surnames. My wife&rsquo;s surname, for example, was Lafont (French). The problem is the vast majority of the population in PR is comprised of lower class black hybrids, most of whom are as dumb as rocks, just like their mainland cousins here and elsewhere, and violent to boot, again like their global cousins. This is the nexus of the performance gap. Some variant of the 1.1 standard deviation black-Euro white intelligence gap. It is genetic and intractable. Were a representative cross-section of the students in PR given the same math exams as are administered in Spain, the results would be predictably the same abysmal mediocrity because the sample population would be of the same low potential - a deficit of human capital, in the euphemism of these PC times. This should surprise no one, least of all the officails in PR who seem bent on producing a barrage of PC correct defensive propaganda rather than addressing the source of the problem, their own demographics.</p>

<p>Resentment and jealousy.  Those are the two main factors why non-whites dislike whites, and in the case of blacks and some mestizos, it turns into uncontrollable hatred.</p>
<p>This is only one of a a dozen important reasons multiculturalism doesn&rsquo;t work and empires fail.  The squabbling among the contentious tribes, especially the ones lower down on the totem pole, just gets so far out of hand the situation is one of constant chaos where at any given moment violence can erupt.</p>
<p>How long do the multicult fools believe they can get the empire&rsquo;s masses to play, &#8220;let&rsquo;s pretend?&#8221;  How long can they fool the fools into believing &#8220;diversity is our strength?&#8221;</p>
<p>Empires always fail, because the subjects are so disunited.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t for the life of me see what good Puerto Rico is for the USA. There is no oil there. No precious metals. No vital natural resources. It is a bleak, Spanish-speaking island that contributes nothing to America. It is hardly a strategically vital area controlling key sealanes or anything like that. This foolish relic of that very, very stupid war (the Spanish-American war of 1898) should be let go.</p>

		<p>If Puerto Rico becomes a state, then Puerto Ricans on the island, will have to pay federal income tax. They do not do so now, because they have no representation in the U.S. Congress. The only reason the USA holds on to Puerto Rico is so that it doesn&rsquo;t become a Cuban satellite.</p>
<p>At least if Puerto Rico became independent, they would be free to make their own choices. However, my brother- in-law who is of Puerto Rican ancestry, told me that an independent nation of Puerto Rico would sink faster than a puppy with a brick around its neck.</p>

		<p>I was stationed in that hell-hole in 1980. Sabana Seca to be precise. </p>
<p>The folks west and south of the San Juan / Rio Piedras areas were pleasant enough, but for the most part the people are arrogant, loud, ignorant, and STUPID. There were automobile carcasses and broken refrigerators laying around everywhere.  Food stamps were a virtual second currency, and it seems the multi-tone car air horn had become a part of the culture.</p>
<p>Cut them loose. Many I ran into professed a hatred of us imperialist running dogs, but, keep-those-food-stamps-and-benefits-coming-we-know-our-rights.</p>
