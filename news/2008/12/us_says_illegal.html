<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/dec/02/us-says-illegals-go-home/">US Says: Illegals Go Home</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sophia Tareen, AP, Dec. 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just after dawn, Gerardo Lopez Arellano shuffles along in a line of 51 other shackled men on an isolated tarmac where a white, unmarked federal jet is waiting to take them to the U.S.-Mexico border. </p>
<p>The 24-year-old construction worker, who grew up near the Texas border, was deported twice before this year, but he is indifferent on this cool morning at O&rsquo;Hare International Airport. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably be back,&rdquo; he says. </p>
<p>Arellano is one of nearly 11,200 illegal immigrants deported this year through Chicago, the location of a field office for the Midwest region covered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. By contrast, in 2004 about 6,600 people were deported from the region, which includes Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Deportations also have increased nationwide, with nearly 350,000 immigrants sent home through September, compared with about 174,000 in the comparable period in 2004. </p>
<p>The trend is expected to continue, but experts and immigration officials aren&rsquo;t certain whether deportations &mdash; which affect less than 3 percent of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States this year &mdash; are an effective means of controlling that population. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For Luis Armando Jimenez-Gonzalez, a 20-year-old who immigrated illegally to be with his U.S. citizen fiancee, it was worth the risk. He paid a smuggler to help him cross the border. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here to work, to have a better chance,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Jimenez-Gonzalez, who also has a criminal record with a 2007 burglary conviction, worked in construction around Chicago. He was deported on the same flight as Arellano but planned to stay with family in Mexico. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It causes a lot of pain to come here,&rdquo; he said. </p>

		<p>I get sick when I hear of these criminals crossing the border time and time again. Why are they let go? Let&rsquo;s put up tent cities all across the border and hire thousands of Sheriff Joe clones. Then, let the illegals build the fence if they want work. After it&rsquo;s finished, home they go with the warning that if they are ever caught again, they&rsquo;ll spend the rest of their lives at hard labor. </p>

		<p>The title of this article is :  &#8220;US Says:  Illegals Go Home.&#8221;  The key word is &#8220;says.&#8221;  You can say anything, but will you do?  There are stories aplenty about deportation orders that are ignored.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ll probably be back&#8221;, said the Mexican who was deported for the third time.</p>
<p>Hey, next to our phony politicians, this illegal alien is a man of integrity  &mdash;  at least where his promises are concerned.</p>

		<p>  Until the illegal aliens are billed for all the costs involved with deportations and the money is collected from the illegal aliens, by sale of their property and the sale of the property they use, trucks, cars, clothes, jewelry, bank accounts, and a lien for the balance plus interest placed on those who aid and abet the illegal aliens also collected they will return.<br>
  If that is not enough to collect the costs plus interest then charge the sums to the countries of origin and in the case of those countries that do not cooperate or refuse their nationals repatriation deduct triple damages from all money due to them and end foreign aid and places for their students/nationals in the US.<br>
   Then when it finally hurts it will stop.<br>
   Also charge all the lawyers fees and other costs for those who are deported, lose their cases, to the aliens and the remainder to their governments.<br>

<p>Wow&hellip;.what a perfect example of the lies that surround immigration.  With the same breath, the lie of these alien invaders coming here to make a better life for themselves is repeated.  And then the truth is spoken about the real reason he is here&hellip;.to commit crime and victimize whites.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea.  Rather than actually land in mexico, this time, we shove him out of the plane as it flys over mexico city.  After that, I guarantee, he won&rsquo;t be back.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so tired of the, &#8220;I just want a better life&#8221; line. Well, make your own country a better place to live.  If the US pioneers could do it while staring down the barrel of the gun of the 3 greatest super powers of their time, why can&rsquo;t you? The gaul of these people to flee their own country, and then once in the US, they go into over-drive evangelizing their Mexican heritage like it&rsquo;s some kind of marvelous invention or some kind of exotic food. </p>

		<p>The way to revive the economy is to deport all illegals and imported aliens who are here on work visas. Issue a trade embargo against Red China and legislate a 100-year moratorium against all immigration of Hispanics, Africans, Red Chinese and East Indians. </p>
<p>Brazil has an excellent foreign trade policy. If you want to sell your products in Brazil you must manufacture them in Brazil. If America were to adopt the same policy our people would have jobs again. </p>
