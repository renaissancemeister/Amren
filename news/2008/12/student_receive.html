<h1><a href="http://www.thelocal.se/16328/20081213/">Student Receives Damages for Headscarf Slight</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Vinthagen Simpson, The Local (Färögatan, Sweden), December 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A student at a Landskrona secondary school in southern Sweden has been awarded damages for being told not to wear an Islamic headscarf.</p>
<p>The Swedish Ombudsman against Discrimination (DO) has ruled that student was the subject of discrimination.</p>
<p>The three local councils that share the operation of the school have reached a compromise agreement with the ombudsman over a compensation payment amounting to 100,000 kronor ($7,400), according to local newspaper Helsingborgs Dagblad.</p>
<p>The student attends a hotel and catering course and the course involves a period of work experience at a hotel. But the hotel refused to accept that the girl wore a headscarf.</p>
<p>Staff at the school tried to persuade the girl to remove her headscarf. According to the school they did this out of concern for her well-being and because they wanted to explain to her about the hotel industry in Sweden.</p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s management accepts that it has made a mistake. The hotel has since changed its regulations and now allows students on work experience to wear a head scarf or &lsquo;slöja&rsquo;, which can translate as &lsquo;veil&rsquo;, but which in common parlance is often used to describe all sorts of female Islamic head coverings, including those that just cover the hair.<br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no hope for Sweden. Not until the descendants of that nation have an awakening. Who was the novelist that wrote &#8220;the more he did nothing the less time he had to do anything.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Seven thousand dollars for being told not to wear a headscarf?  Let me ask the Swedes: do you want to preserve your culture, language and traditions?  Because if awards like this are upheld and multiplied, you will be subsidizing resistance to and displacement of your nation and folkways by immigrants who you would be <b>paying</b> to <i>resist</i> assimilation to Swedish ways.  Call this sum what it is, a subsidy for the dissolution of Sweden, instead of &#8220;damages&#8221; for some imprecise, emotive, catch-all term like &#8220;discrimination,&#8221; and then ask yourselves: do you want Sweden to disappear?</p>

		<p>We need to rethink the concept of nations.  A nation is more than just borders and land  &mdash;  it is the people on that land and within those borders who make it a nation and who give it a particular character. We need less emphasis on land and borders and more on the people.</p>
<p>For the true rights of man to be exercised in the modern world we need to let different nations remain different and not all have to look like the Star Wars Bar.</p>
<p>Let there be black nations, white nations, red nations, brown nations, blended nations, conservative nations, liberal nations, etc.  Stop with the nutso blending into one bland mass.</p>

		<p>Muslim women&rsquo;s dress was not created with the intent for them to work. That was no mistake!</p>
<p>The existence of a Swedish Ombudsman of Discrimination is the mistake.</p>
<p>Poor school management felt compelled to admit a mistake when they knew there was none. </p>

		<p>I wonder if I would be awarded damages if I was told that as a man, dresses, nylons, and high heels would not be considered appropriate attire for someone of my gender? I have no desire to wear women&rsquo;s clothes, but at the same time, those of us who are part and parcel of western culture know that there are all sorts of unwritten codes that we must comply with -  or else face ostracism. When I encounter Muslim women wearing head-coverings, I ignore them. I turn away from them. I do not speak to them. In other words, I treat them exactly as I would be treated were I to so flagrantly violate societal and western cultural norms.</p>

		<p>Looks like someone made a mistake when they converted Swedish Kronor into US dollars.</p>
<p>The real sum awarded is slightly more than US$12&rsquo;500</p>

		<p>The muslims are a lot smarter than the swedes.</p>
<p>That is why they will in time displace the swedes and enjoy a nice country by the sea and it will just be populated by muslims.</p>
<p>A happy ending if you are a muslim.</p>
<p>If you are a swede, you are probably scratching your head wondering what happened.</p>

		<p>Muslims no more belong in Sweden than they do in America. They&rsquo;re uncivilized cretins so they need to stay in their own sinkhole. End of story. Muslim women are pathetic. Their men treat them like furniture and they support wholeheartedly their RIGHT to be treated like furniture. Any white person who feels sorry for these losers needs to have their head examined.</p>

<p>I hate to disappoint you Matt, but this is exactly what those women, and their men, desire.  If any Muslims are reading this thread right now, they&rsquo;re thinking, &#8220;Good! It&rsquo;s working!&#8221;<br>

But at that point it will no longer be  &#8220;nice&#8221;.  It will be another Somalia   &mdash;    a nest of pirates and bandits, a country plagued by corruption and torn by internal warfare between rival clans and factions.  </p>
<p>Good luck, Sweden!  You&rsquo;ll be needing it.<br>
Well, you made your own choice &hellip; silly, Marxist fools!<br>

		<p>Jesse is correct.  One hundred thousand Swedish Crowns amount to $12,745 USD (as of today).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty nice money to collect for wearing a headscarf!  Better than having a job and working. I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised if she was calculating this when she refused to remove her headscarf. It paid off nicely.<br>

		<p>Name one positive thing Muslims have contributed to the Western societies they are infesting today.  You can&rsquo;t.  Now contrast this with their endless acts of terrorism and Islamic cultural imperialism.  </p>
<p>The Western politicians who allow these interlopers into their countries are the absolute worst kind of traitors, because they are providing aid and comfort to an enemy that not only strives to possess our nations, but intends to obliterate our religions as well.  These inbred clinically insane Medieval throwbacks want to destroy all non-Muslim secular and sectarian values and replace them with Islam.</p>
<p>Allah is their name for Satan.  Allah is not God.  Allah&rsquo;s messenger Mohammed was a child raping pedophile who married his favorite bride when she turned six and consummated their marriage when she turned nine.  Islam is not a religion of peace.  The Koran is not a holy book.  The Koran is the Book of Satan that ensues conquest, murder, rape and the total acquiescence of ones soul to evil incarnate.</p>
<p>These are the people our politicians are selling their political influence to in exchange for oil money.  These are the people our local politicians and bureaucrats go out of their way to please.  These are the people we must drive from our lands as our ancestors have done repeatedly throughout history.  These are the children of Satan&hellip;<br>
