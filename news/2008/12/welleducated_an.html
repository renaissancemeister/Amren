<h1>Well-Educated and Undocumented</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Terrell, Orange County Register, December 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maria is one of thousands of students in Orange County who have been able to attend college through AB 540, a California law that allows undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, rather than the higher fee charged to non-California residents.</p>
<p>The Register is withholding the full names of the undocumented students at their request and under newspaper policy that recognizes the potential for retaliation against them.</p>
<p>Undocumented students are ineligible for state or federal financial aid, but do get help under a policy that allows them to pay the same fees as California residents. For example, non-California residents pay an additional $20,608 a year at the University of California; up to $10,170 at the California State University: and up to $170 per unit at community colleges.</p>
<p>Since AB 540 was enacted in 2001, a growing number of undocumented students in California have been able to pursue college degrees. There are no statewide numbers on how many undocumented students receive help through the program or how much they receive.</p>
<p>While the bill has opened doors to some undocumented students, it has also created a big debate about the legality and merit of subsidizing education for illegal immigrants. And for students like Maria, who would not otherwise have been able to afford higher education, AB 540 has created a huge unanswered question: What happens after graduation?</p>
<p>Every year an estimated 50,000 undocumented students graduate from U.S. high schools. About five percent of those students continue on to college, according to Roberto Gonzales, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Washington, who conducted several studies about undocumented students in Southern California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The debate is heading toward the state Supreme Court</p>
<p>One of the attorneys leading the fight against AB 540 is Kris Kobach, chairman of the Kansas Republican Party. Kobach represents a group of students who attended California universities and paid the much higher out-of-state tuition rate.</p>
<p>The students&rsquo; attorneys argue that, among other things, AB 540 conflicts with federal immigration laws limiting the ability of states to provide certain benefits to undocumented immigrants, said Nicholas Espiritu, staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Adding to the complexity of AB 540 is that the law also benefits U.S. citizens who attended high school in California for more than three years and moved out of state after graduation. They too can qualify for in-state tuition through AB 540. In fact, advocates stress that the majority of people taking advantage of the law are U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>According to a 2008 annual report, all but 455 of the 1,639 students who received in-state tuition in the UC system through AB 540 were citizens. Currently, the CSU system does not track AB 540 students, and paperwork varies among community colleges. Fullerton College had 571 students enrolled through AB 540 this fall, but was unable to provide the Register the potential percentage of those students who are undocumented.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A growing number of undocumented students who feel stuck in limbo find the answer to the big &#8220;what next&#8221; question in graduate school, hoping that immigration reform will be passed by the time they earn a master&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>&#8220;College at least offers some safety for students. I wouldn&rsquo;t call it sanctuary, but at least it&rsquo;s the one legal option they have. Those who aren&rsquo;t (in school) face a day-to-day life of looking over their shoulders,&#8221; Gonzales said.</p>
<p>Being a full time college student provides no protection from deportation, said Virginia Kice, Spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to break down stereotypes,&#8221; Maria said. &#8220;We are here, we are getting an education and we want to make the world better too.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are waiting for things to change so we can use our degrees,&#8221; said Matias, a recent graduate of University California Los Angeles.</p>

		<p>Before I received my Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree, I had attended California State University at Long Beach in 1982 and 1984.  I attended Humboldt State University, in Arcata, California, in 1985.  I owe Guaranteed Student Loans, my biggest outstanding debt, from attending those schools. </p>
<p>I believe one of the federal laws prohibits tuition breaks for unauthorized aliens. I am hoping now that Nunez is no longer a California State Assembly Speaker we can somehow reverse the problems caused by those Reconquistors!! </p>
<p>I attended those aforementioned Universities as a non-resident. My understanding is that after being a resident of California for one year, the college/university tuition rate is much lower.  I am disgusted that The State Of California continues to allow illegal aliens to attend College for free, a violation of federal law and a slap in the face for those of us Citizens who want an education to improve this country!!  I guess some people are learning the lesson of subsidizing illegal aliens the hard way, through the School of Hard Knocks, through the threat of bankruptcy;  While the Governor denies illegal aliens are a cause of their fiscal crisis!!!</p>

		<p>  When this law is used to aid illegal aliens it discriminates against US citizens. I thought this had already been ruled illegal by the California Supreme Court.<br>
  Why is aiding illegals with taxpayer money not a felony for the officials who do it ? <br>
   Why not Deport all the illegals who benefited for theft/misapropriation etc of taxpayer funds ? The government workers/school officials and their advocates might also be charged for obtaining government money to aid illegal aliens and discriminate against citizens. Where are the lawyers to defend Americans when our civil rights are violated by illegal aliens and their supporters ?</p>

		<p>For those Amren readers who believe these illegal residents don&rsquo;t also get scholarship money I would be to differ. It is easy for undocumented residents to send the money to their banks in Mexico City and show NO assets on their scholarship application. The rewarding of scholarship money is extremely secretive and not available for public knowledge so is open to all kinds of political maneuvering.</p>

		<p>Only 50,000 illegals graduate from U.S. high schools every year?  That&rsquo;s either a typographical error, a lie intended to minimize the problem of foreign invasion, or a clear indication of how little these people really add to our national well-being.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s apparent that those who which to transfer wealth to the undeserving illegals want to bankrupt the system.</p>

		<p>All I can say about this is that I am glad that we have Proposition 13, the tax limitation measure passed many years ago.Otherwise we would be spending twice as much moolah on education, much of it for illegals.The hand wringers whine about how little moolah we have to spend for schools, but they turn a blind eye when it comes to how much illegals are costing us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Illegals in California have no trouble getting a college education at tax-payer expense.&#8221;</p>
<p>California is on the way out.  Billions of dollars short of what they need to meet budget requirements right now, and they are going to have to raise taxes to get it, they will be in worse shape this time next year when the economy is going to be even worse.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy looks like the only way out for them, and afterwards their generous programs, based in utter stupidity, are going to have to be cut entirely and many cut back so far they&rsquo;ll be near zero.</p>
<p>And the reason?  Airhead fantasies about what kind of utopia they want to create have influenced their decisions for years now.  <br>

		<p>Since these California Universities no doubt receive federal funds in one way or another, we are all paying to discriminate against US citizen students attending at higher tuition. This is just criminal - result of sellout politicians which keep getting elected by the minority block votes because, the minorities delight, there is no significant white identity movement in this country. A white identity movement is what is needed in self-defense else whites split their vote and politician mainly worry about pleasing minorities. </p>

		<p>I cannot believe that California citizens allow themselves to be abused in this manner. How many times have we heard of how seniors on fixed incomes simply can&rsquo;t afford to pay higher property taxes, food costs, and what have you. Yet, the politicians, mostly Democratic, in California haven&rsquo;t the slightest sympathy to help them. Instead, they help the children of illegal aliens born here, and even just plain illegal aliens to go to college. What about the seat they are taking from a U.S. or California taxpaying citizen. Again, this doesn&rsquo;t bother Sacramento either. Americans are being used to finance the health, welfare, and education of Mexican and other nationals. It is beyond strange, how it is allowed to go on year after year.</p>

		<p>Even worse that California&rsquo;s education system is its penal system, where of course the vast majority of inmates are Mexican.  I live in Orange County where the glorified babysitter sheriff&rsquo;s deputies earn $120k per year and retire at age 50 with 90% of their income (That&rsquo;s before 95% of them invent a fake malady like skin cancer so that they can also collect an extra $40k per year in disability).  It costs $1500 per day to house inmates.  The county always releases them at 12:01AM so that they can charge the state an extra day.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for this house of cards to collapse.  I was born here, but we brought this plague upon ourselves.</p>
<p>Crime rates are rising to historic levels here.  Meth has replaced pot as the recreational narcotic of choice.</p>

		<p>Since old Arnold doesn&rsquo;t believe all the extra money spent on illegal aliens hasn&rsquo;t put a strain on the state&rsquo;s budget, maybe it is a good thing that they&rsquo;re still getting through the border patrol at a 60% rate of their usual inflow.</p>
<p>He needs to spend a bit more on social benefits, free hospital care, and bilingual education.</p>
<p>Go illegals!  Break their backs until they can&rsquo;t mouth their deceitful lies any more, because your hordes will be taking down the gates to their communities to get your fair share because you are claiming ownership of this country, and the fools are welcoming you with open arms.</p>

		<p>California is bankrupt, but that won&rsquo;t stop them from continuing every possible government give-away program for illegal aliens.  California is basically a sanctuary state for Third World illegals, with the goal of transferring money from USA citizens to Mexicans and their anchor children.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not that the Mexican illegals get any meaningful college education in CA. They get college diplomas of dubious value. Most of the &#8220;education&#8221; that they receive in CA is lefist/liberal indoctrination with instruction how to implement wealth redistribution on a large scale.</p>
<p>In other words, Mexican illegals learn to become future leaders of socialist revolution in the U.S. And the taxpayers willy nilly foot the bill for that subversive &#8220;initiative&#8221;.<br>
