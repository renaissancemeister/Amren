			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Jeter, Virginian-Pilot (Hampton Roads, Virginia), December 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black students were disciplined more harshly than white students in Norfolk schools last year, and the city&rsquo;s main alternative school lacked books, a nurse and other resources, a former principal contends.</p>
<p>The Madison Alternative School and other Norfolk schools also handled special needs students&rsquo; education inappropriately, he says.</p>
<p>These and other allegations of civil rights violations have been leveled by Madison&rsquo;s former principal, Michael L. McIntosh, who has filed merited civil rights charges against at least one other school division in the past. He also says that top administrators in Norfolk suspended him for voicing concerns.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education is now investigating McIntosh&rsquo;s complaint. If the department&rsquo;s Office of Civil Rights finds any violations and an agreement cannot be reached to make improvements, then federal money could be withheld from the division or the matter could be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Madison school, at 37th Street and Hampton Boulevard, first opened nearly 100 years ago and has served as an elementary and junior high school. Today it educates middle and high school students with the most serious behavior problems, including some in probation or parole programs. Students under 18 who are pursuing GEDs in a special program also attend.</p>
<p>Most students are sent to Madison for long-term suspensions. The offenses can include multiple discipline violations, gang-related activities and assaults in the schools &mdash; problems that Norfolk city and school officials have wrestled with this year.</p>
<p>Largely because of its population, former students and their parents describe Madison as a school with students prone to bad behavior and teachers who try to instruct but don&rsquo;t always succeed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Madison&rsquo;s facilities and services were inadequate, according to McIntosh&rsquo;s complaint.</p>
<p>The school lacked a nurse and a psychologist, and there were &#8220;few books and other instructional materials,&#8221; his complaint said.</p>
<p>Some former teachers agreed with McIntosh.</p>
<p>Mayo-Pitts said the school also had no library or a high school social studies teacher last year.</p>
<p>There were two discipline deans and two security officers, but Madison needed more staff members to control student behavior, said Karl Elder, who retired this summer after five years as a dean at Madison and more than 29 years as a Norfolk educator.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McIntosh&rsquo;s complaint alleges that black students were given longer suspensions and were considered repeat offenders for fewer violations than white students.</p>
<p>Last year, 88 percent of Madison&rsquo;s students were black, compared with about 65 percent of Norfolk students in grades six through 12, according to school division statistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a doubt, there was an amazingly large number of African American students at Madison as compared to white students,&#8221; Elder said.</p>
<p>McIntosh also contends black students weren&rsquo;t allowed to return to their zoned schools after serving their long-term suspensions at Madison.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The assistant city attorney said McIntosh&rsquo;s accusations of racial discrimination were baseless. Nationwide, there is a problem with minority students being disciplined more than white students, Mungo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s easy for someone to cry out &lsquo;race, race, race,&rsquo; in the area that we&rsquo;re dealing with,&#8221; Mungo said.</p>

<p>Yes, it is, and it is one of the things causing chaos, hate, confusion and strife and ultimately the ruination of a once great nation.</p>

		<p>Surely there is recorded evidence and documentation for every student who is sent to a special needs school. In Australia such places are for students with documented learning disabilities vouchsafed by experts like psychologists, doctors and experienced teachers. If critics of disproportionate meting out of discipline or streaming of groups into schools looked at the records for individuals they would most likely find the statistical variations are justified. </p>
<p>It should also be remembered that the sub-prime crisis arose because of pressure to treat ethnic and racial groups equally, rather than individuals according to their own abilities to pay.</p>
<p>Likewise when students are punished within the school system, the reason is carefully filed. In any case, today punishment is ridiculous. Students feel abused if they are &#8216;yelled at&rsquo;. When I was at school, a reprimand was just the beginning. But we accepted our punishment. There is nothing wrong with the maxim &#8220;Spare the rod and spoil the child.&#8221; There was a lot less incarceration of black people when the rod was used more liberally in their formative years.</p>

I&rsquo;m coming to realize that a lot of the MSM&rsquo;s manipulation and distortion of racial stories isn&rsquo;t done so much with outright lying or misrepresentation; rather, the secret to their mind-control successes is in what is strategically LEFT OUT. It consists in NOT asking the follow-up questions that obviously OUGHT to be asked. Consider the following from the above article: </p>
<p><br>
The assistant city attorney said McIntosh&rsquo;s accusations of racial discrimination were baseless. Nationwide, there is a problem with minority students being disciplined more than white students, Mungo said.</p>
<p><br>
If there is a &#8220;problem&#8221; with minority students being disciplined more than white students, then mightn&rsquo;t this be because minority students NEED discipline more than white students? </p>
<p>Because the way the story sits now   &mdash;   WITHOUT that necessary question being asked   &mdash;   leaves the reader with the impression that there is a vast racist conspiracy across the land that UNFAIRLY reprimands innocent black youth on a systematic basis. </p>
<p>Which is, of course, absurd. </p>
<p>To any reader not schooled in AR-type of race-realism and media-skepticism, the &#8220;takeaway&#8221; from this article would apparently be that this Virginia school board may be racist in disproportionately punishing blacks, but then SO DOES EVERY SCHOOL BOARD IN AMERICA. </p>
<p>Moral of the story? When trying to make sense of a MSM news item concerning race, read it once for what it says&hellip; and then read it AGAIN for what it DOESN&rsquo;T say. </p>

		<p>Everyone with any common sense knows to the liberals the blacks can do no wrong.Its everybody elses fault.They are truely the sacred cows of our society.The colleges have created liberal nazis to turn in the people of truth.These blacks in their culture are taught to resist rules and law and order.The liberals justify this resistance.We the racialists are the minority in this country.We have to accept the fact that our fight is an up hill battle now.Like the French resistance during the 2nd World War we must go underground and fight back.RISE UP WHITE NATION!</p>

		<p>School teachers at public schools are expected to be babysitters. Rather than jail or spending any money on kids, they go to public school and cause trouble. No one can really complain about them. The wrong person always gets blamed. </p>
<p>Alternative schools are not &#8216;schools&rsquo;. Kids are sent here to ride out their suspension time until they can go back to their schools to not contribute to their school or to their own education. </p>
<p>If the special needs children come from poor, uneducated homes like most of the above, there will be the same behavior problems. It&rsquo;s just that much harder for a teacher to handle their situation. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lose-lose situation providing books, good teachers, or any services to out-of-control, uncaring students. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to spend my time working on a lost cause. (That sounds horrible because kids are suppossed to be our future. Not today! I won&rsquo;t pretend.)</p>

		<p>This buried MSM story gives us a glimps of Hell. And make no mistake about it, US public schools with disciplinary problem minority students are a Hell. They resemble prisons much closer than schools. The fact that these schools have few library or social studies resources doesn&rsquo;t matter because few or any of the students have any interest in using these educational resources.</p>
<p>The whole issue every day is:</p>
<p>Control</p>
<p>Just as in prison.</p>
<p>The other issue is jobs - public schools even in the worst of the worst offer comparitively good paying, public sector union jobs - where it is hard to be fired.</p>
<p>Just as there are lots of takers for prison guards there are takers for babysitter, prison guards for these public schools. The public just wants control, wants these youths off the streets.</p>
<p>And the youths want to be on the streets.</p>

		<p>I have never seen or actually heard of an incident involving racism in the discipline of black students, but I sure have witnessed or know of incidents involving blacks not being disciplined because of their race.</p>

		<p>I attempted to discipline an African-American student this fall for disrupting the class. He stated in a meeting with his parents and the principal that I regularly used racial slurs against my black students.   I was vindicated, of course, but had to resign because of the resulting hostility from the administration.  Even a false accusation from a black is enough to ruin a career these days. I am a white male FYI.</p>

		<p>My wife works for NC public schools where all the teacher&rsquo;s aides are black women who got the job with quickie diplomas at a local college that caters to welfare women wanting professions. They are supposed to do all the tedious grunt work for the teachers but invariably the white teachers tire of the grumbling of the black teacher aides. These women simply sit around all day and verbally confront any teacher that complains. They are constantly complaining about not getting respect from their &#8220;boss&#8221;teachers and are always at the principals office to gripe. They skip days and have fellow aides punch them in at the clock.</p>

		<p>Here is a link to the follow up story.  Just as I knew, McIntosh&rsquo;s claims were absolutely bogus, and even the City Attorney said he&rsquo;s just a disgruntled employee.  How sad for the children. :-(</p>
