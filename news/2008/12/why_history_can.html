<p>{snip} It&rsquo;s unlikely that you were surprised to see Obama&rsquo;s face on the cover. He has come to dominate the public sphere so completely that it beggars belief to recall that half the people in America had never heard of him two years ago &mdash; that even his campaign manager, at the outset, wasn&rsquo;t sure Obama had what it would take to win the election. He hit the American scene like a thunderclap, upended our politics, shattered decades of conventional wisdom and overcame centuries of the social pecking order. Understandably, you may be thinking Obama is on the cover for these big and flashy reasons: for ushering the country across a momentous symbolic line, for infusing our democracy with a new intensity of participation, for showing the world and ourselves that our most cherished myth &mdash; the one about boundless opportunity &mdash; has plenty of juice left in it.</p>
<p>But crisis has a way of ushering even great events into the past. As Obama has moved with unprecedented speed to build an Administration that would bolster the confidence of a shaken world, his flash and dazzle have faded into the background. In the waning days of his extraordinary year and on the cusp of his presidency, what now seems most salient about Obama is the opposite of flashy, the antithesis of rhetoric: he gets things done. He is a man about his business &mdash; a Mr. Fix It going to Washington. {snip}</p>
<p>The real story of Obama&rsquo;s year is the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments: beating the Clinton machine, organizing previously marginal voters, harnessing the new technologies of democratic engagement, shattering fundraising records, turning previously red states blue &mdash; and then waking up the day after his victory to reinvent the presidential-transition process in the face of a potentially dangerous vacuum of leadership. &#8220;We always did our best up on the high wire,&#8221; says his campaign manager, David Plouffe.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s competence fills him with a genuine self-confidence. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve got a pretty healthy ego,&#8221; he allows. That&rsquo;s clear when he offers a checklist for voters to use in judging his performance two years from now. It&rsquo;s quite an agenda. Listen: &#8220;Have we helped this economy recover from what is the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression? Have we instituted financial regulations and rules of the road that assure this kind of crisis doesn&rsquo;t occur again? Have we created jobs that pay well and allow families to support themselves? Have we made significant progress on reducing the cost of health care and expanding coverage? Have we begun what will probably be a decade-long project to shift America to a new energy economy? Have we begun what may be an even longer project of revitalizing our public-school systems?&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more: &#8220;Have we closed down Guant√°namo in a responsible way, put a clear end to torture and restored a balance between the demands of our security and our Constitution? Have we rebuilt alliances around the world effectively? Have I drawn down U.S. troops out of Iraq, and have we strengthened our approach in Afghanistan &mdash; not just militarily but also diplomatically and in terms of development? And have we been able to reinvigorate international institutions to deal with transnational threats, like climate change, that we can&rsquo;t solve on our own?&#8221;</p>
<p>And: &#8220;Outside of specific policy measures, two years from now, I want the American people to be able to say, &lsquo;Government&rsquo;s not perfect; there are some things Obama does that get on my nerves. But you know what? I feel like the government&rsquo;s working for me. I feel like it&rsquo;s accountable. I feel like it&rsquo;s transparent. I feel that I am well informed about what government actions are being taken. I feel that this is a President and an Administration that admits when it makes mistakes and adapts itself to new information.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I. Simple Competence</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After Katrina, demand collapsed for the very qualities that Obama lacked as a candidate: empty boasts, finger-pointing, backstabbing and years of experience inside a government that couldn&rsquo;t deliver bottled water to the stranded citizens of a major U.S. city. Spare us the dead-or-alive bravado, the gates-of-hell bluster, the melodrama of the 3 a.m. phone call. A door swung open for a candidate who would merely stand and deliver. Simple competence &mdash; although there&rsquo;s nothing simple about it, not in today&rsquo;s intricate, interdependent, interwoven, intensely dangerous world.</p>
<p>His official theme was change, but a specific kind of change: the nuts-and-bolts kind you can see and measure. Voters were invited to believe because Obama kept delivering the goods. Certainly he made mistakes and gave up on some ideas while doubling back on others &mdash; his promise to stick to the existing campaign-finance system, for example. On the whole, though, he was a doer. Obama told people that a black man could win white votes. In Iowa he proved it. He said a broad-gauge campaign could win in GOP strongholds; along came Indiana and Virginia and North Carolina. He declared that a new approach to politics would topple the old Clinton-Bush seesaw, and topple it he did. He sank the three-pointer with the cameras rolling. Made a speech in a football stadium feel intimate. Some might say these are not exactly Churchillian achievements, but in the land of the hapless, the competent man is king. In the end, his campaign e-mail list numbered some 13 million people, of whom more than 3.5 million put actual skin in the game &mdash; money, volunteer hours or both. Obama&rsquo;s most formidable opponent, Hillary Clinton, tried to convince voters that he was all talk and no action, a vessel empty but for intoxicating fumes. Yet he was the one whose campaign ran like clockwork, while hers was a fratricidal mess. And by Nov. 4, the strongest party in the U.S. was no longer the Republican Party or the Democratic Party; it was the Obama Party.</p>
<p>II. Filling the Vacuum</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Obama, as Rudy Giuliani put it at the Republican Convention in September, had &#8220;never led anything, nothing, nada&#8221; &mdash; certainly not a sprawling organization spread from coast to coast. But he did have a philosophy of leadership, which he explains like this: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s some magic trick here. I think I&rsquo;ve got a good nose for talent, so I hire really good people. And I&rsquo;ve got a pretty healthy ego, so I&rsquo;m not scared of hiring the smartest people, even when they&rsquo;re smarter than me. And I have a low tolerance of nonsense and turf battles and game-playing, and I send that message very clearly. And so over time, I think, people start trusting each other, and they stay focused on mission, as opposed to personal ambition or grievance. If you&rsquo;ve got really smart people who are all focused on the same mission, then usually you can get some things done.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama is a businesslike boss. He prefers briefing papers tightly written and shows up for meetings fully prepared. He expects people to challenge him when they think he is wrong and to back up their ideas with facts. He&rsquo;s not a shouter &mdash; &#8221;Hollering at people isn&rsquo;t usually that effective,&#8221; he explains &mdash; but if he thinks you&rsquo;ve let him down, you&rsquo;ll know it. &#8220;What was always effective with me as a kid &mdash; and Michelle and I find it effective with our kids &mdash; is just making people feel really guilty,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Like &lsquo;Boy, I am disappointed in you. I expected so much more.&rsquo; And I think people generally want to do the right thing, and if you&rsquo;re clear to them about what that right thing is, and if they see you doing the right thing, then that gives you some leverage.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yes, Obama could talk &mdash; like nobody&rsquo;s business &mdash; but talk didn&rsquo;t win the election. According to the daily tracking polls, the tumblers clicked into place precisely at the moment the financial hurricane hit, when the wizards of Wall Street proved as incompetent as Oz and neither the President nor the leaders of Congress nor the Treasury boss nor Senator McCain could deliver a rescue package. When this group failure provoked a stock-market crash in early October, Americans asked, &#8220;Can&rsquo;t anybody here play this game?&#8221; Astounding as it would have seemed scant months before, their gaze fell on the one fixed point in the widening gyre: a guy named Barack Hussein Obama.</p>
<p>III. Fear Itself</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Long before Election Day, Obama decided that an ordinary transition wouldn&rsquo;t do. Given the shaky economy and two wars, he knew that the winner of the election &mdash; whoever it turned out to be &mdash; would face instant and daunting challenges. He wanted to be ready. &#8220;What I was absolutely convinced of was that, whether it was me or John McCain, the next President-elect was going to have to move swiftly,&#8221; Obama recalls. He deployed Podesta in midsummer to lead an unusually elaborate preparation for a possible Obama presidency. McCain accused him of overconfidence and vanity, of measuring the Oval Office drapes. To Obama, it was simply a matter of prudence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama had been pondering whether he should step to center stage or wait in the wings as the turbulent last months of the Bush Administration played out. His aides were all over the map. Some advised him to go quietly about his business in Chicago and insist that America has just one President at a time. For Obama to succeed, they argued, the country needed to see his Inauguration as a clean break, a new sunrise. Others floated the idea of immediately starting the First Hundred Days, perhaps asking George W. Bush to appoint Obama&rsquo;s choices to key offices so that they could get to work by late November.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Within two days, however, events forced his hand. On Friday, Nov. 7, Obama convened a meeting of his economic advisers in Chicago, and the tone of their comments was chilling. The stock market was plunging; credit remained tight; fresh unemployment numbers were shocking. {snip}</p>
<p>Obama opened the meeting by reflecting on his dilemma: act now or wait until January? By the end of the session, he had concluded that, like it or not, he must &#8220;accelerate all of our timetables,&#8221; as he put it, &#8220;in appointments not just on the Cabinet but also our White House team, in structuring economic plans so that we can start getting them to Congress and hopefully begin work &mdash; even before I&rsquo;m sworn in &mdash; on some of our key priorities around the economy, on laying the groundwork for a national-security team that can take the baton in a wartime transition.&#8221; There was no time for the &#8220;traditional postelection holiday.&#8221; Vacations would have to wait until Christmas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He could not have predicted when he set out to become President that he would face such circumstances. The distance from the birth of his campaign to these first days of his fledgling presidency could be counted in months but measured in light-years. When he announced his candidacy on a frigid morning in Springfield, Ill., in 2007, Iraq was a disaster, and the Dow was still headed upward past 14,000. So this moment was a test not only of his speed but also of his flexibility. Obama proved lithe, indeed, persuading Robert Gates, Bush&rsquo;s Secretary of Defense, to remain in his post and asking Clinton, a constant critic of Obama&rsquo;s foreign policy views during their primary battle, to be his Secretary of State. Priority 1 was the economic team, however. There his task was to find a mix of people familiar enough to signal stability but fresh enough to promise change, and to design a stimulus strategy dramatic enough to inspire markets to swallow their panic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>IV. Into the Breach</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The events of the past autumn produced the sharpest drop in consumer confidence ever recorded, and a similar wave of fear cratered credit markets. Obama notes the very real structural flaws in the economy, but he is also aware of the role that fear plays. &#8220;Nobody trusts other people&rsquo;s books anymore. And people decide, &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m just going to hold on to my cash for a while,&rsquo;&#8221; he explains. &#8220;And that compounds the crisis. And all that results in a contraction in lending, in consumer spending, which then has a real impact on Main Street. And so what starts off as psychological is now very real.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama has begun to turn his thoughts to his Inaugural Address. According to strategist Axelrod, he is looking for the right mixture of bracing and boost in a speech that will be &#8220;both sober and hopeful.&#8221; He may signal a new day by announcing a plan to stem the foreclosure crisis, which aides say is in the works. As the gray Chicago sky frowns outside his conference-room window, Obama rehearses his message. Americans &#8220;should anticipate that 2009 is going to be a tough year,&#8221; he says. Then he adds, &#8220;If we make some good choices, I&rsquo;m confident that we can limit some of the damage in 2009. And that in 2010 we can start seeing an upward trajectory on the economy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>You would think they might wait until he actually takes office.  This guy has never done ANYTHING.  Hopefully this might put a halt to some of the anti-white male hate going around when he turns out to be a disaster but I doubt it.</p>

		<p>The real reason for the Obama phenomenon is the Liberal media. The media machine can take any loser and turn them into a star, just like what they do in Hollywood. And these days politics is virtually synonymous with entertainment. There&rsquo;s no objectivity. Because the major media is itself Liberal it creates a reality where Liberal ideas seem common sense and the ultra-Left Obama makes the most sense of all. Of course, Obama&rsquo;s really a scourge as is all he stands for. An all-powerful government that deprives you of your independence and resourcefulness, a decadent and self-absorbed culture, a brand of cultural marxism that will certainly destroy everything the West stands for if something is not done&hellip; These are not attributes to be admired and no sensible person does admire them.</p>

		<p>What a gem factory of nonsense this article and its so-called author, Comrade Von Drehle, are.</p>
<p>1.) &#8220;In the waning days of his extraordinary year and on the cusp of his presidency, what now seems most salient about Obama is the opposite of flashy, the antithesis of rhetoric: he gets things done. He is a man about his business &mdash; a Mr. Fix It going to Washington.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that is the &#8220;thesis statement&#8221; of this article, which it appears to be, it is beyond laughable. General Secretary-elect Obama has done nothing, other than appoint a bunch of his only serious opponent&rsquo;s spouse&rsquo;s old cronies to high office, including the Red Queen herself. How is that the mark of even &#8220;simple competence&#8221; or &#8220;change?&#8221; Well, it isn&rsquo;t; what it is the mark of, is a totally inexperienced political figure who has decided that his best bet, is to change absolutely nothing. He is simply going to be the new label on a bottle of fetid corruption, that brought about this crisis of the day in the first place. </p>
<p>Moreover, it says something that Comrade &#8220;journalist&#8221; Von Drehle can make such a statement as:</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama&rsquo;s most formidable opponent, Hillary Clinton, tried to convince voters that he was all talk and no action, a vessel empty but for intoxicating fumes. Yet he was the one whose campaign ran like clockwork, while hers was a fratricidal mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>And totally miss the irony of his willingness to appoint her Secretary of State; if those are not actions of &#8220;a vessel empty but for intoxicating fumes,&#8221; then I do not know what one is. If she is so incompetent and &#8220;fratricidal,&#8221; just what is she going to be doing in such an important post, playing Tammy Wynette to Obama&rsquo;s George Jefferson?</p>
<p>Oops, I meant Obama&rsquo;s reincarnation, or &#8220;second coming&#8221; of, George Washington fused with Thomas Jefferson; oh, silly me!</p>
<p>2.) &#8220;&#8216;What was always effective with me as a kid &mdash; and Michelle and I find it effective with our kids &mdash; is just making people feel really guilty,&rsquo; he says. &#8216;Like &lsquo;Boy, I am disappointed in you. I expected so much more.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting that &#8220;guilt&#8221; is mentioned by this mulatto abomination, as being his &#8220;effective&#8221; way to get others to respond to or even obey him. Please remember, what his hippie circus and Red freak show campaign was really about, the utterly nebulous, besides his &#8220;liberating&#8221; and &#8220;historical&#8221; complexion. Along with that, always undulating under the surface, was a near euphoric apoplexy of &#8220;white guilt&#8221; about to be &#8220;exorcised.&#8221; </p>
<p>Of course, on an anvil of &#8220;change&#8221; with the hammer of &#8220;hope,&#8221; constantly being the Red blacksmiths&rsquo; ever unspoken, but always muscularly drumming point!</p>
<p>So where might that put his &#8220;presidency,&#8221; in the face of some looming disaster(s)? </p>
<p>Will it be on the path of &#8220;racial healing,&#8221; or simply atomic &#8220;white guilt&#8221; mongering to save his bacon?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Sorry, Amren.  I appreciate the articles you bring to us and the effort you expend to keep this site active.  It&rsquo;s a hell of a good service for all white people.</p>
<p>But, I just couldn&rsquo;t wade through such an article on a subject that was so silly, by a writer who apprears to be gushing with enthusiasm over a man that could well turn out to be about ten times more incompetent than Bush.  In the best possible light he might turn out to be average if he tries his best constantly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of wasted words on a subject that has very little interest about a man that has has very little ability, and was elected pres only because he&rsquo;s black.</p>

<p>What exactly has he done anyway? He has a remarkably undistinguished record aside from winning the election, and it was whites&rsquo; desperation to prove they&rsquo;re not &#8220;racist&#8221; that mainly accounts for that. His record in the Senate was notable primarily for its vagueness  &mdash;  he voted &#8220;present&#8221; 100 times instead of voting &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; He has a record of bad associations and bad judgement. Apparently, this whole gushing article is based on the fact that&hellip;he won an election. Uh, can that not be said about any elected official? Thin gruel indeed for such a long-winded puff piece.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m still waiting to see actual proof of his birth certificate. I really don&rsquo;t think he is constitutionally allowed to be president. And I have never been a reader of Time magazine nor people nor Look. These magazines are a waste of time and feed on liberal agenda. He is already backing off from his promises to the liberal left and has made a few enemies of them already.</p>

		<p>Hey, Question Diversity, you got it exactly right along with a few other posters. Balack Odummy couldn&rsquo;t have made it into Chicago politics if not for the ultra corrupt liberal media and its cohorts. He can&rsquo;t speak once he is off the teleprompter. It was funny watching him tell a reporter to quit wasting their question. How long will the media tolerate this? My answer is as long as he fills their liberal agenda. He will not continue to back off the liberal ideas. Once he is in office, we are on the fast track to complete socialism. I can&rsquo;t say Bush has done much to prevent this, but Odummy will make many of us pine for a Bush presidency.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hold your breath for a real birth certificate. </p>
<p>I am through trying to be nice and hold the high ground for moral standards. It&rsquo;s time for name calling and figtin!!!<br>

		<p>BO is going to be a victim of circumstances, and the permanent government will be making the tough decisions. The next decade is going to be a long hard slog against catastrophe and this muddled man is not going to cut it. The FBI already has the goods on this guy and will let him play so long as he knows who is boss, which is good since he is not qualified to do anything but pose.<br>
What is this goof going to say to the clout of the Asian nations? Russia? The threat of Iran?<br>
 He is going to be scripted the whole time he is in office and the scriptwriters, as I have suggested, aren&rsquo;t even his.The CIA, et al told him early on to talk all he wants but if he wants to leave the office with honor he&rsquo;d better play by their rules; to demonstrate this the FBI stepped in. They have Rahm Emanuel on tape and told BO so, and if he wants to stay out of the flashlight beam he&rsquo;d better play straight.</p>

		<p>BHO deserves the cover of TIME magazine only as CON MAN OF THE YEAR! Just as he was selected by the MSM for the Democratic nomination,the loser John McCain was selected as his opponent because McCain had already proven to be an unpopular,unelectable &#8220;Republican&#8221;.McCain was bankrupt and way down in polling when he miraculously became the front runner overnite.Anyone who watched the Republican &#8220;debates&#8221; and had any common sense could see the bias and rigging of the process.I will not waste my time voting in another Presidential election.Obama is not a liberal he is a radical leftist who has never run anything but his mouth.God help us!    </p>

		<p>Perhaps 4 years from now Prez Obama&rsquo;s devoted supporters will be  as joyous as they are today. Perhaps the U.S. will be secure, more prosperous, totally unified in its diversity, and less polluted. Perhaps all 330,000,000 inhabitants of the U.S. (except racist White men) will be extolling the virtues of their magnificent post-White male president, and the rest of the world will join them. <br>
For my sake, I hope so. But I foresee hard times for the U.S. in the next decade, and I have no reason to expect much from Obama in the way of improvement. Economically, environmentally, and socially the U.S. may well be in a hopeless position, from which no leader can extricate it. Time will tell. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;In the waning days of his extraordinary year and on the cusp of his presidency, what now seems most salient about Obama is the opposite of flashy, the antithesis of rhetoric: he gets things done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ha, Ha, Ha! What a sense of humor the writer of the above quote has.  I&rsquo;m from Illinois and I can tell  you for a fact that Obama has accomplished virtually nothing during the last 20 years except run his campagins.  He was deep into Chicago politics for 20 years and Chicago politics is still the stinking, cynical pay-to-play paradigm of corruption as it has always been. He didn&rsquo;t change or fix a thing. NO CHANGE. He spent 20 years working with Jessie Jackson, Bill Ayers, Louis Farrakhan, and the great Reverend Wright, spending millions of Taxpayer&rsquo;s Dollars to &#8220;Improve&#8221; Chicago-area drop-our rates, lower crime, teen pregnancies, unemployment, drugs, etc. and guess what?  After 20 years of spending your money, nothing has changed. NO CHANGE.  While he was representing Illinois as a US Senator, our state was awarded a Billion Dollar Clean-Coal-Energy Contract (Future Gen) from the Federal Gov.  But guess what?  He was so busy taking care of his own business that he allowed Texas to block that award.  He did nothing to help our State.  </p>
<p>Let this be known:  There are no clean politicians from Chicago.  You cannot survive as a politician in Chicago unless you are corrupt.  Obama is one of the most successful Chicago politicians   &mdash;   He raised millions and millions of Dollars from Chicago insiders.  What does that tell you.  </p>

		<p>There is no way anything this guy does is going to be criticized by the controlled media.  He is their poster boy, their hero, their god.  He is Black, the first Black President of the United States. (Forget the fact that he is in reality half-White, raised in part or for the most part by his White mother&rsquo;s side.)  When he puts the finishing touches on this economy and starts enacting legislation purely for Blacks and other non-White groups, and assists in offering amnesty to all illegals, and really moves ahead with the current police state there is no way he will be criticized.  The only way the major media will criticize him is if goes against one group and on group only, and I think some of us know who they are.  (Hint:  they have the most powerful lobby in Washington - incredibly enough a foreign lobby.) </p>

		<p>My gut response to this was that the article provided just what we need to analyze the Pathologies, Psycho and Socio, that I have mentioned before here, and not just here, stating them as the Principle attributes of the Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan.</p>
<p>But that would be enough material for an article, essay, or book, and we should all do what we can in terms of research on this subject, and we should practice rigorous honesty and be prepared for some uncomfortable truths that our research reveals about us, and not just the very disturbing facts it will most definitely reveal about them.</p>
<p>But, this is a post.  So, what could one say about this article that would sum it up in brief?</p>
<p>Well, that, in this day and age, when we have so much precise information about Humanity in general, and this guy in particular, to Mythologize a living figure is NOT &#8220;Progress&#8221;, it&rsquo;s Insanity.  Hence the above mentioned Pathologies.  </p>

		<p>On a lighter note, this article is a marvelous study of Comic Fantasy. I actually read it over again and, yep, it&rsquo;s official, ie; at no point in the entire article do the words and reality meet, ever. Here are some samples.</p>
<p>&#8220;organizing previously marginal voters&#8221;</p>
<p>Previously marginal = Illegal Aliens.</p>
<p>I knew they would get around sooner or later to refering to him as a &#8220;king.&#8221;  <br>
&#8220;the competent man is king.&#8221; That and comparing him to Winston Churchill is so silly it makes you laugh. And, whether you like Churchill or not, he was most definitely an accomplished man.<br>
But this quote &#8220;by Nov. 4, the strongest party in the U.S. was no longer the Republican Party or the Democratic Party; it was the Obama Party.&#8221; moves us quickly from the laughable and embarrasing, to the flatout creepy. </p>
<p>Still, as I&rsquo;ve suggested, we should not give up on our study of the Pathological elements of this silliness. Simply because they have so much authority.<br>
Freedom of Speech is rarely singled-out and praised for what it REALLY does for us, ie; Freedom of Speech is the one idea Mankind (the West, ie; White Men) came up with so as to keep us firmly grounded in - REALITY!<br>
The Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan does not like Reality. As this article makes perfectly obvious.<br>
Hence, we can expect them to eliminate Freedom of Speech.<br>
Because there is no way - no way - they can last in a Country commited to open dialogue, rigorous honesty, and spirited debate. The Leviathan would collapse under the weight of its own silliness.   </p>

		<p>For some people, Barack Obama is THE DEAR LEADER(if you don&rsquo;t understand the reference, think North Korea). He is a phony antiwar activist. He recently-a few days a go-threatned  to annihilate Iran with nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Barack Obama should be seen as a creation of the Republican party. Were it not for nearly three decades of Republican party support of post-1965 non-white immigration party, there would not be a large Democratic constituency thirty years later to   impose  upon on Native Born White America this anti-white Kenyan who harbors malignant intentions towards Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>But if we are honest, the real culprits in all of this are White Republican voters. They should have seen it comming. But they didn&rsquo;t. As long as some White Republican traitor   with a silly looking haircut would promise to go war against some nation that didn&rsquo;t pose a threat to America they would get voted in year after year. The Republican party was and is  the party of invading the world and inviting the world. As a consequence, the Republican party imposed   White voters&hellip;.. BARACK HUSSIEN OBAMA.</p>
<p>One of my White Southern neighbors now drives around with a bumper sticker on his car that says:JINDAL AND PALIN 2012.</p>
<p>Post-1965 non-whites are waging a race war against Native Born White Americans with the help of the Republican party. The Republican party will never refrom itself. The Republican party is the mortal enemy of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Roy Beck and numbersusa.com makes the case against immigration completely in terms of the interests of post 1965 non-whites&hellip;the very people who imposed the anti-white bigot Barack HUSSIEN Obama on Native Born White Americans. Unbelievable,but true. Native Born White Americans have been whited-out over at numbersusa.</p>

		<p>Not sure about YOU, but me, I&rsquo;m already sick of the media gushing over THE FIRST AFRO-AMERICAN PRESIDENT! Whether we&rsquo;ll survive the next four years without barfing over Barky remains to be seen. I strongly suspect by 2012 the nation will be only too happy to turn him out on Election Day. With his impossible promises and goals, he is very likely to fall flat on his face within the first year or two. Having Hillary on his staff, Obama&rsquo;s eventual fall with scuttle her White House aspirations rather thoroughly as well. Obama might be our FIRST Black president&hellip; chances are also very good he&rsquo;ll be America&rsquo;s ONLY Black president.</p>

		<p>For a man who whose campaign mantra was &#8220;change,&#8221; Obama plans to stick to, and even outdo Bush and our last few presidents who&rsquo;ve closed their eyes to the destruction of our country by illegal aliens. These people committed their first crime by breaking into our nation, then continued by stealing IDs and social security numbers. Finding out that those crimes worked, they went on to murder, drunken driving, rapes, molestations and domestic abuse. Most of these crimes seem to be a given in the places they come from, so I guess that&rsquo;s why so many in this country overlook them and want to confer citizenship on them. Those who&rsquo;ve taken the time and money to come legally must be kicking themselves. We are no longer a nation of laws - not when criminals are allowed to not only walk our streets freely, but are welcomed by those who promised to protect and defend us and this once proud nation.</p>

		<p>While I will continue to extol the virtues of presenting the facts to enlighten the unknowing to the imminent danger we face of losing our heritage to alien invaders thanks to traitors in government serving traitors in business, I believe that preaching to the choir should no longer be the dominate theme of this website.  </p>
<p>We know we cannot vote, wish, or pray our nation back to a historical state of normalcy.  We know that those invading our nation will not get religion, see the errors of their ways, and return to their own countries.  We know that our domestic traitors will never become born again patriots until their fear of retribution becomes greater than their uncontrolled greed.   </p>
<p>We are about to witness the most vehemently anti-American administration in the history of our country.  We have had an ineligible white-hating black African forced upon us as president. by the ruling elites.  This fraud intends to &#8220;rule&#8221;, not &#8220;govern&#8221;, via presidential executive orders, therefore bypassing the congress and judiciary.  This is called tyranny.</p>
<p>Now is the time to acknowledge the regrettable course of action we must embark upon.   We must be allowed to share our collective realization of the fact that we must wage a second revolution to preserve the liberties, sovereignty, and heritage our forefathers won for us during our first revolution.   </p>
<p>There comes a time in the course of men&rsquo;s lives when events call upon them to take up arms and use them to defend and preserve all that they hold dear.  That time has come again and destiny has chose us to make history this time around&hellip;     </p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s not only Time&rsquo;s  &#8220;Man of the Year&#8221;.  Here in France, the newspaper Le Parisien has named Obama the world&rsquo;s  &#8220;Man of the Year&#8221;&hellip; (on it&rsquo;s front page, Thursday, Dec.18, 2008). </p>
<p>It seems that every other newspaper and magazine in Europe is still carrying his face.  The newsstands are full of Obama. On this week&rsquo;s Paris Match (magazine), the cover is also taken up with a full page photograph of its own &#8220;Homme de l&rsquo;ann√©e&#8221; [Man of the Year] and the USA&rsquo;s new mulatto First Family: Michelle and kids. Inside is a 24-page spread on them(!)  (Isn&rsquo;t it just wonderful?) It speaks of &#8220;the beginning of a renaissance.&#8221;  Obama is described as &#8220;L&rsquo;homme de l&rsquo;espoir&#8221;  &mdash;    &#8220;the man of hope&#8221;, who will &#8220;remedy the blues of the crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that the Messiah is about to arrive and will be checking in on January 20th. He will remedy the world&rsquo;s ills and will cure all poverty and injustice.  </p>
<p>Me, I&rsquo;m personally afraid that (as with all false messiahs) the world is in for a huge disappointment when they discover that there is only so much any human being can do. There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of disappointment and anger out there when the Messiah turns out to be just a human being after all.  Brace yourselves.</p>
