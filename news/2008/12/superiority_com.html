<h1>Superiority Complex?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>16:9, Global TV (Toronto), December 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Canadian television makes an inopportune effort to find out whether Philippe Rushton is a racist. You won&rsquo;t get to hear them ask any other questions, but you will get to see them play over and over Professor Rushton&rsquo;s accidentally knocking the producer&rsquo;s microphone with his suitcase in a video clip that lasts about 7 and half minutes.</p>

		<p>That was a smear piece, pure and simple. In addition to replaying the &#8220;suitcase incident&#8221; over and over, they tried to embarrass Prof. Rushton by showing clips of some of his speeches to black students at his university, but if Prof. Rushton&rsquo;s views came as a surprise to students, that seems to be a pretty good indication that he keeps his views out of the classroom. Naturally the SPLC was brought in as the arbiter of all things pure and acceptable. Most shockingly, the show implied that Prof. Rushton should be fired for his views (while insisting on freedom of speech for themselves, of course). As for the reporter, he got a chipped tooth. Whose fault is that? Well, he was sticking a microphone in Prof. Rushton&rsquo;s face while the professor was trying to load up his car. On the plus side, Amren&rsquo;s URL was displayed more than once due to its location on Prof. Rushton&rsquo;s podium.</p>

		<p>These guys are gutter journalists, in their own title sequence they proudly show themselves sticking their microphones in a couple of peoples faces with similar reactions, in gonzo style street interviews.<br/>
They are odviousily trying to get Philippe Rushton fired for saying the earth isn&rsquo;t flat, I mean for saying creationism isn&rsquo;t real, sorry I meant to say that genetic differences are more than just physical (the human brain is a physical organ as well last time I heard).<br/>

A disgracefully biased and unfair &#8220;report.&#8221; Note how they absolve themselves having to refute EVEN ONE POINT of Prof. Rushton&rsquo;s. All they have to do instead is to act sufficiently outraged that somebody could even SAY such things, and they &#8220;win&#8221; the moral battle without actually fighting it. Ditto for the black students interviewed: not one of them could offer up even the slightest rebuttal to Rushton&rsquo;s points; instead they merely express their shock and fury over what he said about their race. </p>
<p>And for the idiots who run today&rsquo;s MSM, that&rsquo;s good enough. </p>
<p>Even so, despite the blatant multicult propaganda built into this segment, there will still be a lot of (white) people sitting at home watching this program and saying to themselves, &#8220;What&rsquo;s this Rushton guy saying that&rsquo;s so wrong? All sounds about right to me. And these &#8216;American Renaissance&rsquo; people don&rsquo;t sound too bad either, maybe I should look them up&hellip;&#8221; </p>

		<p>In a situation like that where someone asks you if you&rsquo;re a racist&hellip; it&rsquo;s not a lie to simply say no. You might think to say something like, &#8220;well, if by racist you mean&hellip;&#8221; Forget it. At that point you&rsquo;re already written off as someone who would order little old black women to the back of the bus, or another Simon Legree whipping Blacks. You&rsquo;re grouped with terrorists who bomb Black churches.  &#8220;Racist&#8221; hopelessly means so many things to so many people that it means nothing except that someone is asking you if you&rsquo;re the most abominable entity known to Mankind.  So tell the truth&hellip; and simply say no. </p>

I had the eerie feeling that I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit through the eyes of a heron addict. The Vampires in this &ldquo;16X9&rdquo; HATE propaganda farce make the Taliban terrorist look like reasonable people.</p>
<p>God bless Philippe Rushton, a brave, courageous and dedicated teacher of enlightened truth. He is also an intellectual giant and a tireless worker for the cause of scientific accuracy and social fairness.  </p>

		<p>I am a Canadian and I saw that report. It was a pathetic one-sided smear job. They ask a few black students what they think of Mr. Rushton and get predictable answers. They try repeatedly to use the &#8220;ambush interview&#8221; tactic (in the freezing winter) and throw out &#8220;are you a racist&#8221; shouts at him. No intelligent discussion of his views or attempt to refute them. Sewer journalism.</p>

		<p>I just sent an email to that station in Canada, and stated that they did not research properly prior to talking to Prof Rushton.  I have read his book, Richard Lynn&rsquo;s books. etc&hellip;  Most of the studies show certain Asian races as superior, so it is not a white supremacy the scientific community is advocating.  </p>

Isn&rsquo;t this the mainstay of the left, provoke a response?</p>
<p>The so-called &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; movement was founded on getting in someones face and convieniently having a news outlet there to film the response.</p>
<p>The left loves to go on about the barking dogs and hoses used to disperse crowds but what they don&rsquo;t talk about is the great restraint of not shooting protesters.</p>

<p>Mark it doesn&rsquo;t matter one iota what you or I mean by &#8220;racist&#8221;. What the majority of people mean by the term is what matters to communication. This is a basic principle of semantics. The purpose of a dictionary is to report what most people mean by the term. And any dictionary I&rsquo;ve read reports the most distorted or vile characteristics ascribed to a &#8220;racist&#8221;. Like the hijacked term &#8220;gay&#8221;, &#8220;racist&#8221; is beyond rehabilitation at least for the near future. So don&rsquo;t bother to tell self-deluded people that &#8220;gay&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t really mean homosexual, and the same goes for attempting to enlighten antiwhites about &#8220;racist&#8221;. No one should ever fall for the trick question of, &#8220;Are you a racist?&#8221; This question is about values not facts. Simply say NO.</p>

		<p>That may have been the single coolest thing I have ever seen on AmRen. </p>
<p>First off, as has been stated here numerous times already, it beautifully illustrates the ethical and intellectual bankruptcy of this so-called &#8220;news&#8221; organization. Ambush interviews, inane boilerplate demonization, et al.. I particularly loved the one-sided smearing of AmRen via the SPLC, while giving no time whatsoever to anyone from AmRen to respond (Rushton may be hesitant to speak to the press, and for good reason, but I can hardly imagine Jared Taylor being so).</p>
<p>Speaking of that SPLC dweeb, since exactly when has David Duke been a &#8220;leading light&#8221; of the American right, even the radical part? The guy is all but obscure. The only time I ever even hear his name is when some imbecile throws it out there as a broadbrush denunciation of all things &#8220;racist.&#8221; Everyone knows his name for that reason, but how many people on the street could actually tell you just what it was he did or said to ignite so much controversy? I couldn&rsquo;t even tell you. It happened when I was a kid.</p>
<p>And also, when did Stormfront become anything resembling &#8220;important?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the coolest part was where they showed footage of Prof. Rushton comparing the African mind to that of a sixteen-year-old, and then went immediately to footage of protesters outside having to be restrained by police because they were acting like little kids throwing a temper-tantrum. And all because somebody had the unmitigated gall to say something they didn&rsquo;t like, but of course couldn&rsquo;t refute (and made no real attempt to).</p>
<p>Priceless!</p>

<p>I would tend to agree with that, but once, when my boss who was a black lady, said something rhetorical like that to me, &#8220;you&rsquo;re not a racist are you&#8221;? I replied with &#8220;Yes, I am&#8221;. She didn&rsquo;t say another word. I&rsquo;m not sure what she could have said. Maybe, &#8220;think about it&#8221; something like that. </p>
<p>This story is interesting being it takes place in Canada. Jared Taylor has a lot to say about racism against whites, if you are from Canada, anyway. Mr. Taylor wrote quite an essay about racism in Canada. You can read it by clicking on the Canadian flag on the front page. <br/>

		<p>Mr. Rushton held up his dignity under very trying circumstances. A man to admire.</p>

		<p>The liberal establishment is terrified that continued research might actually prove that the races have quantifiable, irremedial differences.  This is why research on the subject is condemned.  When it is proven that the races are different and that is why they create different societies, the formerly deluded white masses will realize that their politicians have betrayed them by importing people who are (not always but quite frequently) less intelligent, less ambitious, less inventive, less attractive, more hostile, more tribal, more emotional, more fertile, more oversexed, and so on.  Our leaders have hurt our formerly white countries by believing in a utopian fantasy where all people are exactly the same and can achieve equal results if just given a boost with never-ending tax dollars.</p>
<p>Once the cat is out of the bag and EVERYONE knows the truth, just as surely as we know that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, what do we then do about our formerly white countries?  I think we will either have to live with all the world&rsquo;s ethnicities on our soil, or else move en masse to a new land and establish it as a safe white haven, with very strict immigration restrictions.  We would probably have to buy this land from another country and allow their current citizens to come to the U.S.A. if they so chose.  Surely the multiculti paradise of the U.S.A. wouldn&rsquo;t mind losing millions of whites in exchange for more non-whites?!  </p>

		<p>I am curious. Why did this station not say exactly why they or others thought that Rushton was a racist. It was implied that merely by speaking at an Amren meeting, that made him a racist right there. But that&rsquo;s guilt by association. What exactly is it in Rushton&rsquo;s books or writings that is racist? They don&rsquo;t say. What was it in Rushton&rsquo;s Amren speech that was racist? They did not say.</p>
<p>This is nothing more than name-calling and abuse. If they feel Rushton is racist, fine, then lay out the precise case against the man. If not, shut up.</p>

		<p>Because it is human nature for people to root for the home team everyone on this planet is a racist; especially those who deny it the most.  White liberals are racists against their own race and this is racism run amok&hellip;           </p>

<p>In all the years I&rsquo;ve watched bald-faced propaganda pieces such as this on tv, I&rsquo;ve yet to hear anyone even attempt to refute ANYTHING the race-realists say.  The only weapons they have in their arsenal (aside from such &#8220;niceties&#8221; as shouting, interrupting, assault, murder, etc.) are inane rhetoric and argumentum ad hominem.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too bad Prof. Rushton&rsquo;s suitcase didn&rsquo;t knock that microphone down that jerk&rsquo;s throat.</p>

		<p>Mr. Rushton is a very brave man. He is a professor and could easily play the &#8220;P.C.&#8221; game and be living a very comfortable life. Instead he has exposed himself to all sorts of hassels and problems to tell the truth. He commands respect.</p>
