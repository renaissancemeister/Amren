<h1>Southwest Border Fence Hits 500-Mile Mark</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The government has completed 500 miles of fencing along the Southwest border, 170 miles short of its goal.</p>
<p>At this pace, the administration expects to have at least 600 miles complete by Jan. 20, when Barack Obama takes over as president, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said earlier this month.</p>
<p>The president-elect said last week that he wants to evaluate what&rsquo;s working on the border as he considers whether to continue building the 670 miles of fencing. But by Chertoff&rsquo;s estimation, there will not be much left to build.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fence along the U.S.-Mexico border is not intended to stop illegal immigration altogether, but make it more difficult for people to enter the U.S. illegally, Bush administration officials say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boeing Co. has the contract for the technology portion of the fence, as well as for some construction work. The company&rsquo;s contract for the technology expires in 2009.<br>

		<p>By mid Summer, 2009, this falling economy will have a greater effect in keeping Mexicans out than a fence 500 feet high, so if the messiah neglects the other 900 miles of border it won&rsquo;t matter anyway.  </p>
<p>By the time he leaves office we should be up to our butts in a severe depression and/or civil conflagration.</p>
<p>If neither occur, which at this point appears unlikely, our economic situation still will not be one that will have a lot of peon jobs, so whatever the case, the Mexes would be better off to stay home and work to improve their failed nation.</p>

		<p>This Wall Street Journal article claims that for the first time in a decade, unskilled immigrants are competing with Americans for work according to the Pew Hispanic Center. I guess it&rsquo;s like the recession finally being acknowledged one year after it began? With President BO giving amnesty and workers unemployment running out at about the same time, things should get a little hotter in the competition for jobs.</p>

<p>the first time? really? well I&rsquo;ve been competing against unlicensed illegal alien contractors for the last ten years. I think Pew lacks any credibility.</p>

<p>Is this fence really the Bush administration&rsquo;s doing, when Bush has had a lackadaisical attitude toward immigration control for his entire term? Or is the fence merely a distraction to keep from cracking down on employers of illegals and other actions that would be more effective than the fence?</p>

<p>Another government LIE!  Please visit American Patrol Report.  Glenn Spencer flies our southern border regularly and reports the facts.</p>
<p>We are FAR short of the promised 854-mile, double-layered fence!</p>

		<p>We need more than a fence. We need our troops on the southern border. We should also be using our military, as well as federal and local law enforcement, to deport the invaders. </p>
