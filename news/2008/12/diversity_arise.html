<h1>Diversity Arises in More Churches</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yonat Shimron, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), December 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A new study of U.S. religious congregations by a Duke University sociologist shows significant changes in the racial composition of churches within just nine years.</p>
<p>Mark Chaves&rsquo; National Congregations Study finds that predominantly white churches are welcoming more Hispanics, Asians and blacks. The study, conducted last year among 1,506 congregations, raises challenges to the adage that 11 a.m. Sunday is the most segregated hour of the week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Chaves&rsquo; study, the number of people in predominantly white congregations with some Hispanics grew to 56 percent from 49 percent in 1998. Likewise, the number of people in predominantly white congregations with some Asians grew to 44 percent from 38 percent in 1998.</p>
<p>While many of these changes are due to an influx of immigrants, the study found that black and white integration is growing, too.</p>
<p>The percentage of people attending predominantly white churches with some blacks grew to 61 percent from 53 percent nine years ago.</p>
<p>The results of the study, published in Sociology of Religion, were culled from 45-minute interviews in English and Spanish held among church leaders between May 2006 and March 2007. The study illustrates a wide variety of trends in U.S. religious congregations. It concludes that services are growing more informal, clergy are growing older on average and churches are increasingly adopting technological innovations such as Web sites, e-mail and blogs.</p>
<p>But the conclusions regarding integration may be the most startling. Chaves said the study suggests that larger churches are more likely to have diverse ethnic and racial memberships. Those larger churches would include megachurches, defined as Protestant congregations with a Sunday attendance of 2,000 people or more, and Roman Catholic churches, many of which have seen a surge of immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Social issues shift, too</b></p>
<p>Scholars who study the intersection of religion and politics said the growing diversity may mean that congregations may not be able to mobilize as easily on hot-button social issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congregations are easier to politicize the more homogeneous they are,&#8221; said John Green, senior fellow in religion and American politics at the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life and professor of political science at the University of Akron.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean congregations will drop all political activity, but it may be more varied, Green said. For example, issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage may have to share time with issues such immigration reform or foreign policy.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t believe any kind of research or study that came from a PC mind conditioning factory, unless it was unfavorable to political correctness, because most studies in that vein are never published, because the results don&rsquo;t fit their lying agendas.</p>

		<p>The Whites probably want to worship with their own kind.</p>
<p>But what do you do when the Church says that &#8220;there is neither Jew nor Gentile, slave nor free, male nor female, rich nor poor&#8221;?</p>
<p>All categories are broken down, all are equal, and differences are to be obliterated. </p>
<p>And if church is a little bit of heaven on earth, then this obliteration of differences is to spread all over the earth  &mdash;  &#8220;thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Spengler said, Christianity is the grandmother of Bolshevism.</p>
<p>A pity. The West bet on the wrong spiritual horse, a horse that is not listening to the one who nurtured and sustained it and made it great, and is even mightily kicking that nurturing one in the groin and, as in  Freud&rsquo;s famous case of Little Hans, even biting our ears off.   </p>

		<p>Do they examine whether black churches are getting more white congregants? I think not. I somehow can&rsquo;t see any self respecting caucasian sitting there listening to &#8220;God Damn America&#8221;. This is another one-way trip down diversity street.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;Diversity&rsquo; runs in only one direction&#8221;. </p>
<p>This may be true but the original article doesn&rsquo;t say much about it. 600 words or so about diversity, and progress and overcoming evil, and all the story can do is write one sentence, in it&rsquo;s own paragraph, saying, &#8220;The study did not find a greater integration of white people in predominantly black churches&#8221; and then shift gears to something else.  </p>
<p>The multiculturalists and black supremacists having been saying it for a 100 years, something like, &#8216;white society is uniquely defective and racist&rsquo;. I suspect that what they&rsquo;ve been saying is going to come true. The most evil thing in all of history, they&rsquo;ve helped make come true. Whites just want to get away from everyone else. </p>

		<p>My friend, who has a 5 and a 2 year-old, was complaining about this. The First Baptist Church had a birthday party for Jesus with free cake, pizza, and gift bag for ANYONE. The birthday concept with a cake is a good idea. It&rsquo;s relateable for kids. My friend complained about what a waste of money was spent. She would be willing to pay $2/slice to actually have church members recognized as a priority. I was telling her how out of control the diversity and multiculturalism are on a global scale, seeping down into our churches.  </p>

		<p>Churches have become huge sell-outs for Whites.  In the end, they are a business like any other.  It&rsquo;s why I stopped going. What have Churches done for White Americans lately?  All they do is take your hard-earned monies and send them to Africa or some third world country.  The best way to support your own is to insist on programs that help locals or other mainly White groups and to monitor where your dollar goes and to whom it goes. </p>

		<p>This is why most churches are no longer relevant to me.</p>
<p>Christianity is the brand of white Europe.  The cross is on the flags of Britain, England, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and Greece. Christianity and the European people were once united.</p>
<p>When the church stopped being exclusive to whites (and their unique values), it stopped speaking for me.  Now it is a haven for Marxists, and those who worship the false idol of multiculturalism.</p>

		<p>Agree with 6:09pm and yuletide druid.  These studies are funded by Gov multicult agencies and religions are aiding and abbetting the illegals.  It is no secret the Catholic and other churches  encourage all immigrants into USA to become larger religious groups.  Todays religions are nothing more than Big Business likened to Big Gov.  Everything is mass &amp; quantity now.  The foundations of US were about qualitie. Where is it today??????   US has given up persuit of a better life for the poverty business whose main effort is reproduction. Everywhere I go there is begging. From the rich to the poor to the college campus &amp; especially politicians   &mdash;  - all have a hand out.<br>
Poverty is the virtue of Communism.  When there are many more reproducing than can be educated and employed the government seizes the peasants for votes and wholla!  US is propertyless nation filled with poverty.  Welcome to the New World Ordered by Bush I!    V<br>

		<p>Yup!  The church hierarchies are all after us to integrate.  Here in Mississippi, the result has been that nobody is willing to cough up the money to build high-quality churches, anymore.  As congregations flee downtown areas (and magnificent old edifices) for whiter suburbs, we all just throw up big box warehouses to worship in&hellip;..knowing that eventually we&rsquo;ll have to abandon them, too.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that&rsquo;s why we build flimsy McMansions to live in&hellip;.with the assumption that we&rsquo;ll have to move before the trees get big.  My emotional investment in this latest house is zero.  Everything about it and in it is only there to please the appraisor (as cheaply as possible).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d had enough of the national bureaucracy in our church trying to shove integration down our throats.  So with our last change of residence, we moved our membership to an independent congregation.  National conference won&rsquo;t get another cent out of us.</p>
<p>My advice to anyone regarding their church, or their college, or their newspaper: IF IT BITES THE HAND THAT FEEDS IT&hellip;STOP FEEDING IT!</p>

		<p>A few years ago, an odd thing happened that was the talk of the town in Shreveport, La. The pastor at one of the churches made the paper in his attempt to &#8220;pay&#8221; White people to attend his church to increase diversity! Shreveport is not really a racist place, but Sunday morning IS the most segregated time of the week.<br>
There were several articles and op-ed page columns about it in the weeks that followed, all in good fun. Everyone thought it was hilarious. <br>
Did it work? No Whites took him up on the offer as far as I know.</p>

		<p>The churches are being used as an example of how &#8220;multiculturalism works.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the church, for the most part, perhaps it can be claimed that &#8220;multiculturalism works,&#8221; however, a point that I have never seen mentioned is that the church environment is not a competitive one.  The average member is not trying to earn a living at the church or help his kids do &#8220;better&#8221; than other kids at the church.</p>
<p>Once church is over on Sunday, do the multicultural members shun the unchristian special privileges allotted to them by the outside world - such as affirmative action and college entry bias in favor of their children?  I have seen no evidence that they do.</p>
<p>As a devout Christian, a question I have for true Christian leaders is this:</p>
<p>If the liberal left is wrong about homosexuality, gay marriage, abortion, Christmas, allowing students to pray in school, crime, the death penalty, and state-run welfare, how is it that in one case, in one shining example, the left sees so clearly the heart of God and that is on Third World immigration?</p>
<p>What are the odds that the liberals are wrong in their perspective in almost every area of our society except in this one - Third World immigration.</p>
<p>On this one point, the churches and the liberals are in total agreement - &#8220;Flooding America with Third Worlders is good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bible states that you can tell a tree by it&rsquo;s fruit and that a tree produces only one type of fruit and that a spring cannot give both pure and salty water - it is either one or other.</p>
<p>So if liberals are wrong about all of the major issues facing us today (they have shown their &#8220;fruit&#8221;), shouldn&rsquo;t Christians be alarmed when they find themselves allied with liberals on the inundation of our country with foreigners?</p>

		<p>Many churches are also the &#8220;drop-off&#8221; points for gun buy-back schemes promulgated by the local government. Most of these churches are located in black inner-city slums.<br>
They will then turn the guns over to the police, and the person who turned in the gun, will get a gift card, sneakers, or sporting event tickets.</p>
<p>On pro-Second Amendment websites, I refer to this as the church crawling into bed with Caesar to disarm their own sheep, in exchange for cheap gifts given by the merchants and moneylenders.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to the separation of church and state? In black neighborhoods, there is no such thing. </p>

		<p>The churches of today (in my opinion) are strictly tax dodging business enterprises. If Christ were to come today he would start by Sweeping Out these Faux Temples that claim a relationship with him. Kind of like when he tossed the other money changers out of the Temple. </p>

		<p>To paraphrase Michael Andrew Grissom from his book Can The South Survive?, &#8216;We in the South resisted invasion and fought war.  We struggled and resisted reconstruction.  We fought social engineering and forced integration, but when our pulpits betrayed us, the sigh of resignation was palpable throughout the land.&rsquo;  </p>

		<p>This is happening as a political phenomenon.</p>
<p>There is an almost invincible power over the leaders of churches to do this.</p>
<p>There are organizations which go from church to church to make sure that all churches are multicultural.</p>
<p>Here is an interview given by a man considered by many to be among the foremost scholars of religion in the 20th century. Read what he says has happened to his own church:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/qa/1997/11/snell.html?welcome=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.motherjones.com/news/qa/1997/11/snell.html?welcome=true</a></p>
<p>Footnote:</p>
<p>As I understand the Bible and traditional Christianity, Genesis says this of the One World Order (Genesis 6:11):</p>
<p>&#8220;The LORD said, &#8220;Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing (evil / wicked) which they purpose to do will be impossible for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the following verses and chapters, the Lord physically separates the peoples   &mdash;   ultimately into 70 distinct nations, with distinct languages and cultures.</p>

<p>Yes, very telling indeed!</p>
<p>It demonstrates the natural racial feeling that people have under normal life conditions. </p>
<p>This whole study is contrived. The pressure to bring non-whites into formally white congregations has been and is an organized political movement having great power pubically to shame and shun those who resist.<br>

		<p>This is very important.</p>
<p>The church is supposed to be a major source of friendship and also of marriage for those who are Christians.</p>
<p>Therefore, this report shows how the young whites can be encouraged directly by their spiritual leaders to enter into a life of miscegenation.</p>

		<p>Grew up Christian but frankly ALL Christian churches, with the exception of the oddball Christian Identity types, are PRO 3rd World America. You have to see it with your own eyes to see the utter lack of concern with our situation.<br>
Heck it wasn&rsquo;t just Portland State students cheering Bill Clinton&rsquo;s prophecy of White demise.</p>
<p>I sure don&rsquo;t think Asatru or other Nordic revivals will answer the need for philosophical comfort but the Christian Church, sadly, is another enemy.</p>

		<p>But, Thrasymachus, doesn&rsquo;t the New T. posit a new creation, men born of the Spirit, who are all one in the Spirit, and compose those of every race, economic class, sex, etc.?</p>
<p>Thus, what the Old T. portrays as evil, because it was done by men with no God-involvement, the New T. portrays as the new creation, directed by God. Thus, God likes it. I think this is the key: Yahweh does not like things done without him, because he is portrayed as a jealous God! This is  a theme constantly repeated in the Old T.</p>
<p>Christianity is universalist, and, as such, is approved by God. Christianity worked great for Europeans when the world was small, but now the world is big, and we are all thrown together! Those who take Christian altuism seriously are at a disadvantage in the real world, because Christian ethics are directed at all, not just one&rsquo;s familiars.   </p>
<p>With all its virtues, Christianity is universalist and other-directed altruistic (&#8220;What advantage have you, if you love only your friends? I say unto you, Love your enemies.&#8221;)</p>
<p>As always, May the God of the Europeans help us Europeans!</p>

		<p>Of course, when I said above that Mr. Taylor would need to publish the essay, I meant if I were the author. I was not trying to burden him with the assignment of writing it as well!</p>
<p>Without writing an essay here this evening, I can give one or two suggestions why Christian altruism is not about the destruction of nations (nations are properly understood as people of common biological ancestry).</p>
<p>The command of Christ was:</p>
<p>Mark 16:15-16 (21st Century King James Version)</p>
<p> 15 And He said unto them, &#8220;Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.<br>
    <br>
 16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</p>
<p>What is wrong today is that the churches have changed this to &#8220;Bring all the world home to you, and preach the Gospel to every creature.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christianity was something for export. </p>
<p>Loving one&rsquo;s enemies was and is a very high and saintly command. (I think that it means, in part, &#8216;Don&rsquo;t let your enemies psyche you out   &mdash;   be immune to their hatred.&rsquo;)  I very much doubt that it has anything to do with physical love (i.e., sexual love). Miscegenation is the problem of the hour, threatening racial death of the Western world.</p>
<p>Loving one&rsquo;s enemies probably refers more to one&rsquo;s personal foes than to enemy nations. This would mean to try to understand why your personal foes hate you. Understanding and patience may prevent temporary insanity in how one deals with the situation; for if one hates people back, one falls into mental disorder, or irrational thinking and weakness, and lowers him or her self to the same level as that held by one&rsquo;s enemies.</p>
<p>Mother Angelica, a Mother Superior who founded a Catholic television network, explained that this command to love your enemies means &#8220;to wish them well.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Thrasmachus, I respect your religion, or rather, your interpretation of it.</p>
<p>Because of the plastic, inclusive nature of Christianity, phoneys such as Martin L. King are now accepted as saints by a good many Christians. Maybe &#8220;plastic&#8221; and &#8220;inclusive&#8221; are poor word choices, but I respect Christians such as yourself who are not that way.</p>
<p>I will always remember the time my family was coming home from church, where the minister had preached on suffering and sacrificing (not helping, but suffering and sacrificing!) for others, even if, (or maybe, even more so, if) we were not related to them, by family, clan or race. </p>
<p>My seven-year old daughter in the back seat of the car, out of the blue, said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m so tired of all this Jesus stuff!&#8221; We all laughed, but my soul said, Amen, verily!  </p>

		<p>Yuletide Druid,</p>
<p>Yes, based on what passes for &#8216;Christianity / religion&rsquo; these days, I&rsquo;d have to agree with your daughter and with yourself.</p>
<p>It is also simply insane that MLK has even been considered a religious man, let alone a &#8216;saint.&rsquo; His character was rotten to the core and his &#8216;gospel&rsquo; of forced integration is, in my opinion, totally anti-Christ and mixes religion with politics. </p>
<p>The idiot box and other &#8216;educational&rsquo; forces have inundated the TV viewing public with such outrageous anti-White and anti-Western and anti-Jesus propaganda that very few &#8216;Christians&rsquo; even know what their religion really is all about.</p>
<p>Just this Christmas I heard the &#8216;TV people&rsquo; say that Martin Luther (the German reformer) believed that Jesus had intimate relations with his mother, Mary. So blatant and blasphemous a lie   &mdash;   but where is the outrage among &#8216;Christians&rsquo;! </p>
<p>I think that we are actually living in post-Christian times, for all practical purposes.</p>
<p>So, in short, I sympathize wholly with your position, in light of the shameful times we&rsquo;re living in today.</p>

		<p>Also I forgot to put this in (which I had intended to say in my above post):</p>
<p>The MLK holiday is pure idolatry. An orthodox Jewish man also said that that is obvious. </p>
<p>MLK-worship is the new state religion, and it is force on the people   &mdash;   especially school-children. It is this religion which is rapidly destroying the West. Unless this &#8216;holiday&rsquo; is rejected and abolished, the U.S. will perish in our lifetime.</p>
<p>People who worship him, according to traditional Christianity (and Judaism, for that matter - the three Hebrew children refusing to worship the King in the O.T. comes to mind), will lose their salvation, even if they are professing Christians.</p>
