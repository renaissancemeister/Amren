<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20081207/EU.France.Miss.France/">Miss France Wants to Advertise French Diversity</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The new Miss France, born to an African-American mother and white French father, said Sunday she wants to advertise her country&rsquo;s diversity on the world stage.</p>
<p>Chloe Mortaud is not the first nonwhite winner of the beauty pageant, but she is joining a growing chorus of French public figures breaking traditions by speaking openly about race.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go to people and explain to them that fear of the other is unfounded,&#8221; she told The Associated Press the day after being crowned. &#8220;I want to incarnate &hellip; today&rsquo;s French diversity&#8221; at international beauty pageants.</p>
<p>France has championed a colorblind standard that sees all citizens as just French, regardless of ethnic origins &mdash; an ideal meant to make everyone feel equal. But it has failed to snuff out racism, particularly against immigrants from former French colonies in Africa. Discrimination in part fed riots in 2005 by largely minority youth in French housing projects.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mortaud, a dual French-American citizen, said her mother was born in Mississippi but grew up in California, and her father&rsquo;s heritage is ethnic French &#8220;as far back as we could trace the family tree.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is the new face of all pageants.  In no time, no Whites will win any pageants for fear of the judges being labeled racist. Diversity only seems to be celebrated when there is at least one non-white involved.  True racism at its best.</p>

<p> We have a 1/2 White and 1/2 Black here who looks<br>
like neither race. Diversity is the promotion of<br>
mixing so we&rsquo;ll all be a muddled mix one day. The<br>
destruction of all races in the name of a single<br>
mixed race with no particular culture. Of course<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.  It seems Whites in France are more than happy to commit racial suicide.  They don&rsquo;t seem to be aware of what they&rsquo;re doing.  They just appear to mindlessly jump on this bandwagon of multiculturalism.  No thought.  Just lockstep like lemmings being led to the precipice.  No pride in themselves and what they are.  No pride in their history.  They just continue to appease.  They&rsquo;re going to appease right to their graves and the grave of their nation.</p>

		<p>Nice one, 12.55 AM &hellip; I thought she looked very caucasian for a mulatto! I know attractiveness is ultimately subjective, but a comparison of Ms Mortaud with the European women either side of her in the second photo is enough to convince me that the judges had another agenda than &#8216;mere&rsquo; beauty when selecting her as Miss France!</p>

		<p>Does anyone really pay any attention to this race mixing air-headed propaganda anymore? The bottom line message of all this propaganda is this&hellip;race doesn&rsquo;t matter. You can&rsquo;t even walk by the magazine rack at the grocery store without getting a dose of this insane lie. The same message is even on cereal boxes and baby diaper packages and on greeting cards. I guess this is how brainwashing works. It has to be everywhere and don&rsquo;t ever let a race realist have a good chance to get the message out that the Emperor has no clothes.</p>

<p><br>
If that &#8220;other&#8221; is rioting, joining gangs, and committing every category of violent crime at rates MANY TIMES HIGHER than whites, then that fear of those others is not unfounded at all. Fear of people like that is a natural survival mechanism and is therefore ENTIRELY JUSTIFIED. </p>
<p>Consequently, our efforts to remove such &#8220;others&#8221; from our midst are also entirely justified. </p>
<p>PS.  Yes, beauty is subjective. But to me this girl is no more than passably good-looking. I&rsquo;ll admit there are many lovely women of mixed race   &mdash;   but this isn&rsquo;t one of them. This is tokenism, French-style. </p>

		<p>I guess the photo &#8220;mistake&#8221; was to further confuse Whites as to who is black and who is white.  The entire world media seems in on some sort of scheme to blur racial lines.  Of course, France is a leader in this scheme.</p>
<p>But we all have long known what a joke beauty pagents have become.  They are so political.  When I was 16, my sister ran for Miss &#8220;our town&#8221; and came in third.  The black girl who took second was in no way more attractive or talented than my sister.  We constantly see white, blue eyed blondes who just stagger with their beauty and intelligence, but what we hear is blonde jokes and what we see is all men of all races running to places like Sweden to find a blonde among the most beautiful of women on the planet.  That is where to count the votes, not one of these bogus national beauty pageant.</p>
<p>I do hope France gets over this drive toward blackness soon.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>So true! Yet the new Miss France is being praised all over the internet for her remarkable beauty, especially of course among blacks. Just a while ago while on another website, a black woman was saying that whites are threatend by the new Miss France, will forever change the French beauty standard. Threatening maybe, but only because she represents the current trend in the West to erase whites from their own culture, even in their own native homelands. I then asked what was so special about the new Miss France, that indigenous French beauties should be forgotten in her wake.</p>
<p>What is so special about this? </p>

<p>Why not take the train through HLM land alone every day and night for a few weeks and see how you feel about the other (black and arab prowling gangs just looking for girls like you)<br>
You won&rsquo;t even have to get off the train to learn to fear the black and arab inhabitants of HLM land.</p>

		<p>My great grandfather must be turning in his grave! I am of German-Irish-French descent and this kind of race-mixing is a disease and unfortunately is now speading to Europe.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I am proud of my hertiage and what my ancestor&rsquo;s have accomplished in this country! </p>
<p>My great grandfather on my Dad&rsquo;s side-of-the family came to American in the early 20th century to get away from France! I can only imagine what he would think about nonsense like this! </p>
<p>I hate to say it, but Europe like this country, are selling out their hertiage in the name of &#8220;diversity&#8221;! Proud that her mom is black(gee, that&rsquo;s a change since it&rsquo;s usually the other way around)!  I hate to say it but I wouldn&rsquo;t be proud to say I&rsquo;m from France anymore!I did see many white Frenchmen waiting to be with you! You are what we white men call &#8220;tainted meat&#8221;!</p>
<p>Nice, sweetheart, you can have France and your &#8220;multi-cultural utopia&#8221;! Have a wonderful future raising your &#8220;zebra&#8221; children, living off your government, and continuing being the &#8220;half-breed trash&#8221; you are!</p>
<p>The hell with France! As my great grandfather did, I&rsquo;ll take America anyday despite the problems we may have!!</p>

		<p>A large billboard photo of a Black woman in traditional Swedish attire was recently mounted on a Swedish building corner that must have been 3 stories high. If that action was not another attempt at racial indoctrination, then what was the overall purpose of this display? </p>
<p>I tried to locate the photo link, but was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>&#8220;The French actually tolerate an American? That is truly amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not really amazing. Dont forget the French have always had this thing for black Americans. And being half French probably makes her even more acceptable</p>

&ldquo;It is good that there are yellow, black and brown Frenchmen. They show that France is open to all races and that her mission is universal. But on the condition that they remain a small minority. Otherwise, France would not be France. We are above all a European people of the white race, of Greco-Latin culture, and of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>Do you believe that the French body can absorb ten million Muslims, who will perhaps become 20 million tomorrow and 40 million after that? If we allow integration, if all the Arabs and Berbers of Algeria were considered as Frenchmen, what would prevent them from coming and settling on the continent where the standard of living is so much higher? My village would no longer be called Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises, but Colombey-les-Deux-Mosquées!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These famous words were uttered by de Gaulle in 1959.<br>

<p>You&rsquo;re definitely right.  That photo above is Miss France 2008!  It&rsquo;s here with some other racy ones:</p>

		<p>This woman is attractive but no beauty.  She is a token for the multiculturalists.  There are millions more beautiful white and black women than a plain mulatto.  The goal should be to improve the races not degenerate them.  </p>

<p>Having been to France, and seen what the Native French look like as opposed to their immigrants, I could be led to believe that Miss France 2008 could have some Arab or Middle Eastern ancestry, not unthinkable given the high concentration of Arabs living there today. Although, she certainly does not look Mulatta like this years winner.<br>

		<p>A mulatto is actually Black. It is best to remember that. </p>
<p>In reality, Blacks belong in Africa. Asians belong in Asia. Indians belong in India. Arabs belong in Arabia. Native Americans belong on reservations. Mexicans belong in Mexico. Criminals belong in prison. Whites belong in Europe, North America, and Australia.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after our European ancestors conquored and settled the savagery of North America and Australia, they proceeded to go out into the world and collect beings from every corner of the planet to live among them for a variety of reasons, including breeding. Today, such collection is not necessary. The White masters simply facilate the arrival and presence of undesirables using our tax dollars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a matter of control. The most influential Whites control their White subordinates by manipulating other races in order to profit at the expense of the most altruistic people on Earth; White people.</p>
<p>All social programs and affirmative action programs are engineered to divert money from our pockets, through the hands of minorities, and directly back to the small collective of Whites in control.</p>
<p>The takeover by minorities of Europe, Australia, and North America would not be possible if it was not orchestrated by the Whites at the top.</p>
<p>Of course, the people who are printing and stealing all of our money through the systematic devaluation of western society will never have to answer for any of their crimes. They will simply retire to a neutral location of guarded luxury and leave all of the debt and social chaos in our hands.<br>

		<p>Actually, she is not the first non white woman to earn the title of Miss France, or even the first Black woman for that matter. A black woman won the title in 2003 <br>

It should come as no surprise that recent winners do not look fully French, or white. In no way are the recent winners more beautiful than true French women, but the underlying message being sent out is that France is no longer a white country. This can be said of countless European countries these days. While no white countries continue to remain more or less homogenous. It seems the plot here is to rob whites of a homeland! Each and everyday this plot is becoming a reality.</p>

		<p>Yes.. a little more psychological warfare,&hellip; not very different than the rule disregarding black debate team that won the contest and worship of the subservient judges. Its a common process now days to inculcate white youths systematically with self loathing by teaching them all the bad effects of their ancestors throughout grade school. This way they&rsquo;ll be prepared to continue the self debasement and racial suicide later, on their own. As I&rsquo;ve posted several times before &hellip; it seems the previous Marxist movement could not accomplish a permanent redistribution of money or abolition of class structures with the techniques applied. The new Marxist approach is the re-distribution of Genetics which is attempting sucess by the re education camps via public schooling, where as above mentioned white children are taught shame in admiring their own native perceptions of beauty and virtue, while symultaneously being taught to embrace these things of the invading race that will quietly replace them in their own homeland.</p>

		<p>who says all real French people are pasty white caucasions, if you look at a map of Europe you can see France is down there by Italy and Spain, I&rsquo;m 80 percent French and i have dark hair and dark eyes with an olive complexion, my other percentage is english and irish which are the real whity whities, If you go down to Southern France the people look like Italians and Spanish, however in the northern region the people are a bit lighter. </p>
