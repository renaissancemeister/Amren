<h1><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122973612592523337.html">U.S. Workers Crowding Out Immigrant Laborers</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These days, more than immigrants are packing the Hollywood Community Job Center: Unemployed Americans are joining them. There&rsquo;s little work for anybody.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody is coming to look for work,&#8221; says Rene Jemio, outreach coordinator for the hiring hall. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not just your average immigrant anymore; it&rsquo;s African-Americans and whites, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time in a decade, unskilled immigrants are competing with Americans for work. And evidence is emerging that tens of thousands of Hispanic immigrants are withdrawing from the labor market as U.S. workers crowd them out of potential jobs. At least some of the foreigners are returning home.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see competition from more nonimmigrant workers,&#8221; says Abel Valenzuela, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who studies day laborers. &#8220;Employers are also paying less than in previous years,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 2003, the labor force participation rate &mdash; the employed or job-seeking share of the population &mdash; among foreign-born Hispanics had been consistently on the rise. The decline in the third quarter of 2008 &#8220;is a testament to the character and depth of the current recession triggered by the housing slump,&#8221; says the Pew report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latin American workers bore the brunt of the collapse of the construction sector, which employs 20% to 30% of all foreign-born Hispanics in this country. As the housing market tumbled last year, they lost jobs in ever-greater numbers.</p>
<p>Competition has become fierce even in agriculture, where farmers had struggled in recent years to hire enough immigrants to harvest crops, sometimes letting fruit wither on the vine.</p>
<p>Growers across the country are reporting that farmhands are plentiful; in fact, they are turning down potential field workers. &#8220;For the first time since 9/11, we have applicants in excess of our requirements,&#8221; says Bob Gray, chief executive of Duda Farm Fresh Foods Inc., a grower, packer and shipper based in Salinas, Calif.</p>
<p>In particular, Mr. Gray has observed an influx of U.S.-born Latinos and other workers who previously shunned field work. &#8220;These are domestic workers who appear to be displacing immigrants,&#8221; says Mr. Gray.</p>
<p>A similar situation has emerged in U.S. cities from New York to Los Angeles, where unemployed, nonimmigrant laborers are seeking informal work that typically has been performed by low-skilled immigrants that once commanded a 50% premium over the hourly minimum wage.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate for immigrant Latinos was 6.4% in the third quarter of 2008, compared with 4.5% during last year&rsquo;s third quarter. However, the rise in unemployment for this group would have been even greater &#8220;if not for the fact that many of these workers withdrew from the labor market,&#8221; says the Pew report.</p>

<p>Huh? huh? I cannot get over it. The utter disrespect, and denigration of American Citizens by most of the &#8220;newspapers&#8221; across this nation just blows me away. It jolts me everytime I read these kinds of headlines. &#8220;Crowding out Immigrants..&#8221;,etc.</p>
<p>In the first place, we know their talking about illegal aliens. But that only adds to the insulting phrase &#8220;crowding out&#8221;. Are these writers just plain insensitive to the American citzienry or just plain vile? The only legitimate talk of crowding out people is when &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are crowding out Americans and the descendants of Americans. Unfrickinbelievable. I wish all these papers go out of business, like they deserve to.</p>

		<p>This situation has been expected and will get far worse.  It will be one of the more influential aggravating factors that will cause racial eruptions, mostly between blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>Diversity, without doubt, is our number one weakness.</p>

		<p>&#8220;For the first time in a decade, unskilled immigrants are competing with Americans for work&#8221;.</p>
<p>For the first time in a decade, this reporter has discovered the working class, sounds more like it. Then she has the nerve to go on quoting someone from across the country in California saying the recent development has lowered wages. I knew they&rsquo;d get around to covering the subject of wages being held down (sarcasm). This is unbelievable. Then again, for bizarro, upsidedown world, it&rsquo;s more par for the course. I agree these papers deserve to go out of business. Or are at least supported by the dime of those they serve, people of color. And those in a dead tomb somewhere over near the Kremlin. <br>

		<p>Now- &#8220;nonimmigrant workers..Employers are paying less than in previous years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then- &#8220;low-skilled immigrants&hellip;commanded a 50% premium over the hourly minimum wage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, we already know how our country values its white,founding relatives. </p>
<p>I hate that people are out of work, but I&rsquo;m glad true Americans are getting jobs over non-white illegals. It seems like a good sign that it&rsquo;s starting in L.A. I hear some of the worst news from there. </p>

		<p>American citizens are not having much luck here in the industries spanish speaking immigrant networks have taken over. They simply aren&rsquo;t allowed in. They aren&rsquo;t hired. </p>

		<p>Hard times have the benefit - at times, of taking a people back to their roots.  I have said it before, White people need to be the ones running their own farms and factories.  If we treated workers fairly, there would be no need to replace them with desperate foreigners.  Kids ought to be working in the summer or in school.  This summer camp elitism has got to go.</p>
<p>Teach real European culture to White kids,all the way from ancient times to the present.  Use facts, not lies and there will never be a need to revise with more lies.</p>
<p>If we really want the White race to survive, we have got to get it right this time.</p>
