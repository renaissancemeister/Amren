<h1>Playing Defense</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sonia Scherr, SPLC Intelligence Report, Winter 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Wearing T-shirts with a picture of their late son, Jamiel and Anita Shaw stepped in front of a podium bearing the logo of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). The Shaws had arrived in Washington that morning on a flight from Los Angeles. They faced more than 100 people gathered on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in Baghdad, Iraq, when my son was murdered by an illegal alien gangbanger,&rdquo; Army Sgt. Anita Shaw told activists taking part in &ldquo;Lobby Days,&rdquo; FAIR&rsquo;s annual drive to influence members of Congress on immigration policy. Jamiel Shaw broke down several times as he described how he heard gunshots and then saw 17-year-old Jamiel Shaw Jr. bleeding on the sidewalk. The younger Shaw, a high school football star, was killed on March 2 near his home in South Los Angeles. Police say two Latino men drove up to Jamiel, asked him which gang he belonged to, and shot him when he didn&rsquo;t reply. (Shaw had no criminal history and was not affiliated with a gang.) Nineteen-year-old Pedro Espinoza, an undocumented immigrant, has pleaded not guilty to Shaw&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would think he&rsquo;d be trying to act like an American,&rdquo; Jamiel Shaw said of Espinoza. &ldquo;But sometimes they don&rsquo;t want to be American. They want us to be like their country. And he was from Mexico. I&rsquo;m not going to sugarcoat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Shaw told his audience that the race of his son&rsquo;s killer had no bearing on his anger. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of black illegal aliens, there&rsquo;s Latinos, whites. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me. I want them all [out],&rdquo; he said to loud applause. Since their son&rsquo;s death, the Shaws have been lobbying for Jamiel&rsquo;s Law, a proposed Los Angeles city ordinance that would require police to go after immigrant gang members who are in the country without papers but haven&rsquo;t committed any non-immigration violations.</p>
<p>The Shaws&rsquo; grief is understandable. Still, there is a question as to whether they are being used because of their race. On June 21, the Shaws &mdash; who are black &mdash; spoke at a rally co-sponsored by Save Our State, an anti-immigration hate group that has allowed racist skinheads to join its protests and whose founder wrote on the group&rsquo;s online forum that &ldquo;just because one believes in white separatism that does not make them a racist.&rdquo; Then, on Sept. 10, the Shaws were featured speakers at the gathering that launched FAIR&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hold Their Feet to the Fire,&rdquo; a talk radio blitz held in conjunction with Lobby Days. Although there is no evidence that the Shaws had any idea of Save Our State&rsquo;s background or FAIR&rsquo;s connections to white nationalist ideology, the Southern Poverty Law Center lists both organizations as hate groups.</p>
<p>Cognitive Dissonance</p>
<p>The Shaws&rsquo; appearance highlighted the glaring disconnect between the way FAIR tries to present itself publicly and the reality of its association with white racism. In 2006 FAIR created a front group, Choose Black America, to recruit black Americans to its cause and to deflect accusations of racism. Yet FAIR founder John Tanton, who still serves on FAIR&rsquo;s board, has long promoted the ideas of white nationalists to FAIR leaders and others &mdash; and FAIR officials have unflaggingly stood by their founder, insisting he is no racist. </p>
<p>Contradictions between the mainstream image that FAIR seeks to cultivate and the group&rsquo;s links to extremists weren&rsquo;t hard to find during its three-day campaign on Capitol Hill. The event brought dozens of private citizens to Washington to lobby lawmakers on behalf of FAIR. While the anti-immigration activists met with members of Congress, more than 40 talk show hosts conducted two days of live broadcasts from &ldquo;radio row&rdquo; at the Phoenix Park Hotel. The most prominent among them was Lou Dobbs, the host of CNN&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lou Dobbs Tonight&rdquo; who has repeatedly spread false information about undocumented immigrants, including the myth that they&rsquo;ve contributed to a dramatic surge in U.S. leprosy cases. Dobbs received one of FAIR&rsquo;s &ldquo;immigration reform awards&rdquo; at a private reception during Hold Their Feet to the Fire.</p>
<p>But even as they were being heralded as immigration reformists, Dobbs and radio personality Roger Hedgecock, who co-sponsored Hold Their Feet to the Fire with FAIR, were hosting extremists on their shows. Hedgecock invited Peter Brimelow, who runs a racist, anti-immigration website called VDARE.com, to appear on a Sept. 11 broadcast from radio row. Brimelow has advocated changing U.S. immigration quotas to let in mostly whites and praised the Pioneer Fund &mdash; a eugenicist group set up to encourage &ldquo;race betterment&rdquo; &mdash; as &ldquo;a perfectly respectable institution.&rdquo; He has also been interviewed on &ldquo;The Political Cesspool,&rdquo; a white nationalist radio show whose guests have included former Klan boss David Duke and long-time Holocaust denier Mark Weber.</p>
<p>Dobbs spoke on Sept. 10 from radio row with another man who can include a &ldquo;Political Cesspool&rdquo; appearance on his resume: Chuck Baldwin, the then-presidential candidate of the staunchly antigovernment, anti-gay Constitution Party. Baldwin has written that &ldquo;the South was right in the War Between the States&rdquo; and that Martin Luther King Jr. &ldquo;brought havoc and unrest to America as few men have ever done.&rdquo; Baldwin asserted during a campaign appearance that Sept. 11 could have been an inside job, and vowed, if elected, to appoint an independent committee to uncover the truth.</p>
<p>Attacking the &lsquo;Elites&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speakers at FAIR&rsquo;s only public event during Hold Their Feet to the Fire repeatedly invoked that 2001 tragedy to argue that undocumented immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border pose a serious national security threat. &ldquo;9/11 is not gone forever from the public memory,&rdquo; FAIR President Dan Stein declared before the Shaws took the podium. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still fresh in the minds of American people. We&rsquo;re not going to let elites in this country bury the urgent priorities that need to be done.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Though billed as a press conference, the event felt more like a political rally. U.S. Reps. Duncan Hunter, Brian Bilbray and Darrell Issa, all California Republicans, addressed the gathering, where activists and talk show hosts far outnumbered journalists. (While some activists paid their own way, FAIR helped defray the lodging expenses of those who attended as part of an organization.) &ldquo;Look at all of you, and let&rsquo;s have a round of applause for all those people who came to make sure this Congress hears from the people,&rdquo; cheered Hedgecock, the San Diego talk show host. Activists waved small American flags and held signs that commanded, &ldquo;Free Ramos and Compean,&rdquo; the U.S. Border Patrol agents sentenced to a maximum of 12 years in prison for the 2005 shooting of an unarmed, fleeing drug smuggler. (Ignacio Ramos&rsquo;s wife, Monica Ramos, and father-in-law, Joe Loya, looked on from the crowd; Monica Ramos appeared on Dobbs&rsquo; show that night.)</p>
<p>The supposed press conference lacked a question-and-answer session for journalists; in fact, the speakers did not seem to be addressing the press at all. Stein, who served as a master of ceremonies, led the audience through a series of call-and-response questions. &ldquo;Are we going to let both political candidates go through this election without talking about the issue?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; they responded.</p>
<p>Stein lamented that people weren&rsquo;t hearing much about immigration at the Republican and Democratic national conventions. &ldquo;You have to wonder why that is. This is an issue people really are concerned about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, recent surveys suggest that that is changing: immigration has tumbled to near the bottom of Americans&rsquo; list of concerns. According to this summer&rsquo;s monthly Gallup polls, the percentage of Americans naming immigration as the nation&rsquo;s top problem has dropped to the low single digits, ranking it below a host of other issues including the economy, the situation in Iraq, fuel prices, dissatisfaction with government, the energy crisis, unemployment and health care.</p>
<p>Not only has its cause lost traction, but also press coverage of FAIR has increasingly noted its hate group designation. Though he&rsquo;s declined to answer questions from the Intelligence Report, Stein alluded to the recent criticism during the Sept. 10 gathering: &ldquo;The opposition got upset and they decided they had to try mudslinging and that&rsquo;s been going on. But you know what, when you sling mud at an organization like FAIR and its 200,000 members, you&rsquo;re slinging mud at people who have worked hard all their lives to try to bring about reform, people who have lost loved ones, people whose husbands are in jail for trying to defend our borders and do the right thing, victims of 9/11. Doing the right thing is doing what we&rsquo;re all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet doing the right thing apparently does not include severing ties with racists. The group that invited the Shaws to help make its case continues to embrace ideologues like Tanton, who said in an infamous 1986 memo: &ldquo;As whites see their power and control over their lives declining, will they simply go quietly into the night? Or will there be an explosion?&rdquo; <br>

		<p>If all you have is a hammer, pretty soon the whole world begins to look like a nail.</p>
<p>The SPLC is eager to get their dog in the mass immigrant fight by doing the only thing they know how to do, labeling those they don&rsquo;t like a racist.  This is why is is so perplexing that a black would have the audacity of arguing against illegal immigration.  It pisses on their parade.  </p>
<p>Ironically I have long since come to the conclusion that the SPLC does not like whites.  All of their positions are consistant with that statement.  Their work goes way beyond suing skinheads that are obviously racist pigs and have hurt someone.  They just cannot phrase it that way from fear of being outed for what they really are.  </p>

		<p>Oh, yeah, this is really a good one. The Southern Poverty Law Center talking about &#8220;explioting situations&#8221; for personal gain of some kind. It could make one roll on the floor with laughter, if it weren&rsquo;t for their devious attacks on peoples freedom of speech and other issues.</p>

		<p>This entire smear piece boils down to a single tactic: guilt by association. But I have an insider&rsquo;s tip for the SPLC: I know of a guy who has written books full of racist statements and insinuations, who has made racist comments that have stereotyped and put down an entire race of people, whose preacher was a racist demagogue who used his sermons to incite racial hatred in a major city, and, who has close ties with a convicted terrorist. And what&rsquo;s worse, this guy wants to be president of the United States! </p>
<p>His initials are BHO. I&rsquo;m sure the SPLC will get right on it.</p>

		<p>Throw the racism charge back at SPLC. State unequivocably that it is racist to support an immigation policy that will reduce the majority Native Born White American population to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. Don&rsquo;t back off from this. Then ask Mark Potak why Native Born White Americans should be in favor of an immigration policy that will over time reduce the Native Born White American majority to an ever dwindling racial within the borders of America. Hit him with this question over and over and over again. State unequivocably that the SPLC is a racist organization that despises Native Born White Americans. That the SPLC is an organization that harbors malignant intetnions towards the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN POPULATION. Point out that post-1965 non-whites are politically organized around their racial interests. It&rsquo;s  all about race for post-1965 non-whites. WE don&rsquo;t care what the SPLC thinks of our movement.  Do not spend any time trying to prove to the SPLC that WE are not racist. WE put the burden on the SPLC the burden on the SPLC to prove that they do not harbor racist intentions towards the NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN POPULATION.</p>
<p>On Nov3 2008, Blacks imposed an anti-white African bigot upon Native Born Whie Americans. Becasue of this, there can be no coalition between White Americans and blacks.</p>
<p>There is no debate. WE are oppose our racial dispossession at the hands of post of post-1965 blacks,hispanics,asians and muslims. And if the SPLC and mark Potak doesn&rsquo;t like this&hellip;WE don&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suing&#8221; so-called &#8220;skinheads?&#8221;  What this means is that the SPLC sues a &#8220;skinhead compound&#8221; in Idaho, because one of their people got into a fight with a dope dealer, so the SPLC pounces and sues on behalf of the dope dealer.  Morris Dees argues for the plaintiff, and because he&rsquo;s a white Southerner after all, and is therefore pretty good in colorful allegory, and from what I&rsquo;ve heard, a very seductive arguer in the eyes of the average juror, he can con a civil jury into issuing a $7 million judgment against the &#8220;skinheads&#8221; whose assets are then liquidated for $25,000, and then the SPLC sends out thousands upon thousands of triumphant gloating letters to their regular donors, bragging about how they &#8220;shut down a dangerous group of skinheads, and how their further contributions to the SPLC are necessary to continue the cause of keeping the conspiratorial right wing in check.  Which nets way more than $7 million.</p>

		<p>Agreed   &mdash;   Who cares what the SPLC has to say.  More importantly, I think that Premier-Elect Obama should step up to the plate, and hit one home for the true minority group of the planet.  As a citizen of the world he should immediately declare the USA a haven for the White minority around the globe, so that this oppressed group should be forever free to prosper.  All Obama has to do is roll back immigration law to 1964.  C&rsquo;mon champ, show your commitment to global thinking. You can do it!</p>

		<p>This whole article is extremely racist on the part of the SPLC. According to left wing nuts, blacks can&rsquo;t be racist. Since blacks can&rsquo;t be racist, they must be being manipulated by white racists in the background. However, the only way to explain this is to say that the blacks in question are too emotional or too dumb to really understand what&rsquo;s going on. In this situation, that makes the SPLC sound more like an AmRen poster. </p>

		<p>Politics makes strange bedfellows. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for people with different interest to form an alliance to fight a common enemy. Illegal immigration is a common enemy. </p>
<p>According to the SPLC it would not have been correct for the Capitalist to join forces with the Communist to defeat the Fascist during world war two. </p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s wrong with white racist joining black racist to fight brown racist. Blacks do have a legitimate claim to US citizenship and no one has ever argued against that but the illegal aleins don&rsquo;t. Blacks didn&rsquo;t like being hanged by whites so why would they like being shot by Mexicans. </p>

<p>I love how people are full out admitting that unless territory is secured specifically for white people, we will be on the path of racial extermination.  Still, organizations like the SPLC have repeatedly echoed the same statement, &#8220;Surrender white man,&#8221; all while claiming to be for &#8220;fairness&#8221; and &#8220;tolerance.&#8221;  It seems now that they&rsquo;re showing their true colors.    </p>

		<p> I had heard about FAIR and had visited their website but did,t have any extra money to send them.(working class) I just read an article on world net daily (very good website),by pat boone. Well i decided to go without something and send them some money so you can say fair has 200,000 and 1 members now. I think calling someone racist is the most vile word in the english language and it should be stopped. Its not a logical argument to anything and its designed to make other people shun these people. Call people what you want but i joined these people for the good works they are accomplishing. I hope they do even more. People who are oppressed usually band together. Remember the movie Spartucus where they all stand up and say I AM SPARTUCUS! Well its that time.!!!!</p>

		<p>Interesting that SPCL seems to have seen the writing on the wall, and is willing to throw Blacks to the wolves to make room for Latinos on their racist sleigh.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a group like SPCL, you can&rsquo;t represent interests of BOTH Blacks AND Latinos at the same time.  You gotta choose. Clearly, white-hating SPCL has seen the future, and it is brown.</p>
<p>Black Americans are, after all, Americans.  We made the mistake of dragging them here in chains, and for that we are being punished.  But Latinos come here of their own free will.</p>
<p>While Africa is far, far away and in no shape to take care of itself, much less advocate for Blacks in America, Central America is just a short walk away and willing to put a lot of resources and effort into smoothing the way for its colonists. </p>
<p>Greedy international corporations would rather hire docile Latinos.  Blacks aren&rsquo;t bright/personable enough to hack the &#8220;information economy,&#8221; while Whites have too much honor &amp; self-respect to allow themselves to be exploited.  </p>
<p>Plus, Latino birthrate is higher than Blacks or Whites.  Average IQ is higher, too, which means a smarter breed of underclass. </p>
<p>IMHO, Latinos are a bigger long-term threat to White America than Blacks for the same reason that SPCL seems to think Latinos are its future constituency.  </p>

		<p>The predator who killed Jamiel had lived in Los Angeles illegally for 14 years.  He had been deported a couple times.  He had several felony convictions and served time in county jail for those crimes.  He was a career criminal.  He murdered Jamiel about 17 hours after he was released from jail.</p>
<p>Because he was a career criminal illegal alien who had already been deported and returned immigration should have been notified.</p>
<p>But due to Los Angeles&rsquo; love affair with illegal alien murderers, immigration was not notified.</p>
<p>Of course if immigration had been notified he would not have been deported.  But he would have been held in jail for 6 months while immigration went through various hearings and appeals.  Then the murderer would have been released after 6 months.</p>
<p>He probably would have killed someone, but he would not have been in a position to have killed Jamiel.</p>
<p>I live in Los Angeles.  I have observed this event. I thought seriously of going to the Taylor&rsquo;s presentation before the city council.  No whites are helping the Taylors.  They are pretty much doing it on their own with the help of relatives, friends and neighbors.  The black community doesn&rsquo;t seem to be helping them much.  Probably because the black leadership is handcuffed to the hispanics by their white liberal masters.</p>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the SPLC showcase their love of Democracy and Freedom of Speech by hosting a Debate on the subject?</p>
<p>Or, a series of debates dedicated to, above all else, the open and civil exchange of ideas on the matter of Race in America?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a trick question of course.</p>
<p>Democracy, Freedom of Speech, Civility, Ideas.</p>
<p>These things have nothing at all to do with SPLC because the SPLC wants nothing to do with them.  </p>
<p>Just as Peter Brimelow has suggested answering the accusation of Racist with Traitor, I would suggest, and actually have been for some time, that we also answer their accusations by questioning their psychological health.<br>
It can be done, but you have to know what you&rsquo;re doing. <br>
I think that once this starts people far more capable and competent than myself will join in and we might just have a fighting chance to catch the attention of a larger public.</p>
<p>The basic position is that, what I refer to as, The Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan (of which the SPLC is merely on Branch or Division) is filled to the rim with Psychopaths and Sociopaths.<br>
People who promote and engage in manipulation (Sociopathology) and violation, or simply violence (Psychopathology) with no conscience.  And it&rsquo;s the lack of conscience that qualifies and justifies the use of the term &#8220;pathology.&#8221;  <br>
And the do it leveling accusations that they are actually guilty of themselves.<br>
I think that this approach has enormous potential and I have started to make this recommendation to a few of the websites out their run by people I respect.  Since Mr. Taylor is one of them, I am respectfully making the suggestion here.<br>
The best minds we have in the Realist movements from Immigration Realism to Race Realism and any and everything in between, should be recruited and put to use for this purpose.  I honestly think it shows a lot of promise.  </p>

		<p>The SPLC is nothing but another front group/hate group for the ongoing invasion of America in the name of globalization.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got La Raza, Maldef, Lulac, the ADL, the ACLU, CAIR, the UN, the CFR (Council on Foreign Relations)&hellip;  Most members of Congress belong to this group&hellip; and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Then, of course, we&rsquo;ve got the majority of our own government members.  Could you not feel the hatred emanating from Senator Harry Reid towards the unwashed masses with his most recent insult?  Then we have President George Bush calling us &#8220;small minded&#8221; for not allowing the legalization of tens of millions of Third World illegal aliens&hellip;  Then who could forget Jack Murtha calling us a bunch of redneck racists?  And then there&rsquo;s Senator Lindsey Graham with his claim of our being nothing but a bunch of &#8220;bigots&#8221; in front of La Raza&hellip;  This is just the tip of the iceberg&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to see that our government is our Number One Public Enemy; and unless we, the public, stand up and demand &#8220;changes that count,&#8221; we will become a minority and lose America as we know it.</p>
