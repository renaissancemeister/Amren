<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Esteban Armando Nuñez, the 19-year-old son of former Assembly Speaker Fabian Nuñez, was arrested in Sacramento County on Tuesday in connection with the stabbing death of a 22-year-old college student in San Diego, police said.</p>
<p>San Diego Homicide Capt. Jim Collins said Nuñez was arrested along with three other men, all also 19. All four will be taken back to San Diego, where they will be jailed. Each faces one count of murder and three counts of assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>Collins said Luis Santos was stabbed to death at a party near San Diego State on Oct. 4, during a brawl with other partygoers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arrested in addition to Esteban Nuñez were Ryan Jett, Rafael Garcia and Leshanor Thomas. The victim was a student at Mesa College. Three other partygoers were wounded in the fight.</p>
<p>Fabian Nuñez served six years in the Assembly, including four as speaker. Term limits forced him to leave office this year.<br/>

		<p>No surprise, the brother of the president of Mexico in the early was a murderer.  The two of them also murdered their nanny when they were young children.  Nice people.  </p>

 Thank God that the senior Nunez lost his campaign to<br/>
overturn term limits in California this year. We&rsquo;re well<br/>
rid of him as a result. The acorn didn&rsquo;t fall far from<br/>
the tree.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Collins said Luis Santos was stabbed to death at a party near San Diego State on Oct. 4, during a brawl with other partygoers&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This happened on Oct. 4th and is only NOW being announced to the public?</p>
<p>Do you think the son of a Republican would have received the same kid glove treatment from the MSM?  Did the Marxist press mention that fabian nunez is a Democrat? </p>
<p>In the local LA Daily Kos, this story appeared as a very small blurb, buried in the back pages, below the fold. If it weren&rsquo;t for Talk Radio, this murder would already be Old News, never to be mentioned again.  </p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s no wonder the son has no respect for the law  &mdash;  his mexican socialist father has NEVER had any respect for the law.  I fully expect nunez to blame White racism and racist cops as the real reasons for the murder of Luis Santos. </p>
<p>Nunez pere has spent his entire &#8216;career&rsquo; making life as easy as possible for illegal aliens (LAWBREAKERS) in California  &mdash;  fighting for drivers licenses for them and declaring he would refuse to enforce the five year limit on welfare (from the Clinton welfare reform act) even if it meant the state having to pay big fines to the feds. </p>
<p>This racist California pol, when called about misused campaign funds such as more than $47,000 spent in plane fares, more than $5,000 spent at a wine cellar in France, and more than $2,500 for &#8216;office expenses&rsquo; at Vuitton, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Because of the fact I am Mexican, they think I have to sleep under a cactus and eat from taco stands&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sorry about the cliché, but in this case it fits:  The acorn didn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree.</p>
<p>John and Ken have been on this story all day  &mdash;  doing the job the MSM refuse to do. The link below provides a picture of the murderer.</p>

		<p>So much for &#8220;family values&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>And this guy, Fabian Nunez, had the nerve to push for extended term limits&hellip;  Thank Goodness his bill didn&rsquo;t pass, and he&rsquo;s out!</p>
<p>As for his law-abiding son&hellip;  He deserves whatever he gets!</p>

		<p>I guess this guy was too busy being a corrupt politician to do anything more than raise a totally pathetic loser for a son.  </p>
<p>All these men thought they were &#8220;gangsters&#8221; too. Geez, most gangsters at least wouldn&rsquo;t spend their time looking for random strangers to stab.  I hope these guys get the death penalty.  Their act was premeditated and incredibly vicious.  </p>

		<p>This is absolute proof that what vdare.com says about Mexican immigration is true.  The longer they stay the worse they get.  Vdare.com has done extensive research to show that 3rd and 4th generation Mexicans are even more violent and criminal than their immigrant grandfathers.</p>
<p>Grandfather Nunez was not a criminal.  He was just an illegal immigrant job thief.  Fabian was an affirmative action leader created by Ford Foundation front groups while in college.  And his son, who has had the benefits of affirmative action, money and prestige is found to be a common murderer.</p>
