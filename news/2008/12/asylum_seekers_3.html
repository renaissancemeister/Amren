			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Press Association, December 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of migrants waiting to submit asylum applications rioted in central Athens, setting fire to rubbish bins and attacking passing cars.</p>
<p>Protesters said the riot began when one man fell into a nearby canal after authorities told the crowd that no more applications could be submitted. Only a small number of applications can be submitted each week.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear how the man fell into the canal. Police said he was injured and was taken by ambulance to a hospital. They said they were investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Outraged asylum-seekers began setting fire to rubbish bins and throwing them into the street, and ripped branches off trees to set them alight. A smaller group threw rocks at passing cars, stopping some vehicles and banging on them with their hands. There were no reports of any passers-by being injured.</p>
<p>The riot lasted for about an hour, and riot police who were on standby nearby did not intervene. A fire truck extinguished the blazes.</p>
<p>In October, a human rights group said a Pakistani man was fatally injured when he fell into the same canal.</p>
<p>The group, Stop the War Coalition, said that the man had been trying to escape police after immigrants queuing to submit applications clashed with authorities. Police rejected claims they had any involvement in the man&rsquo;s death and said they had tried to repulse an attempt by a large group of migrants to jump the queue.</p>
<p>Rights groups have often criticised Greece&rsquo;s treatment of illegal immigrants and the living conditions in detention centres.</p>
<p>Greece approved only 140 of the 20,692 asylum applications made in 2007, according to the UN refugee agency. Tens of thousands of illegal migrants enter Greece each year. Many attempt dangerous sea crossings from nearby Turkey or brave minefields to make their way in.<br>

		<p>Asylum seekers should seek entrance in the country they are trying to escape from, not when they get to where they want to live, ususlly for economic reasons anyway, or as part of the Muslim world takeover of the West.   After they have arrived illegally, they are therefore already proven criminals by this vry act and unacceptable for asylum anyway as they then have a criminal record.  When will the governments set this sensible standard law?   When will Western governments wake up and enforce the laws?</p>

		<p>The media is working overtime to cover up why these riots really started.  Now that leftist groups and spoiled college students have joined in the rioting, most people will never learn the truth.  I tried to leave a comment to this effect on the &#8220;Have Your Say&#8221; board at the BBC website, and it was apparently censored by the moderator.  <br>
Immigrants are now rioting in Spain as well.  It appears that multiculturalism is about at the breaking point; the real question now is how long can the media keep the people in the dark and how long will it take for the people to snap out of their current pc-induced trances.</p>

		<p>When I first saw this story in the MSM, the rioters were referred to as &#8220;students&#8221;. I&rsquo;m not kidding, &#8220;students&#8221;. It was only after reading down through the comments section that one of the contributors blew the whistle on what was actually going on in Greece. </p>

		<p>Maybe, just maybe, Greece has noticed what is happening to the rest of Europe.  Once a few &#8220;refugees&#8221; gain a toehold in their country it becomes much more difficult to stop the floodgates from opening.  They become the enemy from within who demand that all their friends and family be allowed to immigrate.  If they fail to stop these illegals from coming in now it will be impossible to stop it later as their numbers build very quickly in the near future.</p>

<p>If things are so bad for illegal immigrants in Greece, perhaps they should stay in their native countries and not go to Greece.  As for those &#8220;rights groups&#8221;, what they ignore is that Western societies also have rights.  Foremost among them the right to exist without being invading by hordes of barbarians.</p>

<p>The students decided to join the riots for no other reason than because they could. They hate the government, they say it is corrupt, and they say they would like to see it fall. What annoys me is that Greece has only recently been democratic after years of successive military dictatorships. Under the military junta the Left were marginalised, so why they would want to topple the current government is beyond my comprehension.</p>

		<p>There are not many muslims in Greece.  I don&rsquo;t think there are many illegals either as jobs and free money are better elsewhere.  These are SOCIALISTS and self proclaimed ANARCHISTS that just go around smashing private property a few times a year when they feel like it.  </p>

<p>  The reports from our controlled media indicated that the rioters were Greek &#8220;anarchists&#8221;. I was completely unaware of the multicultural/refugee aspects. Thanks again AR. Good job neo-Marxist controllers/brain-washers!</p>

		<p>The latest I heard was that a shot ricocheted and killed a &#8220;15-year-old boy&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>The common thread is that the MSM throughout the EU always calls these domestic terrorists &#8220;youths&#8221; or &#8220;students&#8221;&hellip;  PC dictates that they must NEVER ever mention the true fact that these &#8220;unhappy immigrants&#8221; are nothing but a bunch of thuggish terrorists!</p>
<p>It definitely appears that things are starting to crack in the wonderful world of the EU&hellip;  Spain, Italy and Greece have all had their fill of massive immigration, and the unrest is growing throughout the EU.  </p>
<p>Just the other day, the EU &#8220;leaders&#8221; created yet more hate legislation directed at, of course, white Europeans&hellip;  Just to mention your frustration with immigration or hand out literature on this subject can now land you in jail for one to three years.  </p>
<p>The Liberals know that, thanks to the internet, their gig is up; and they&rsquo;re truly starting to sweat&hellip;</p>
<p>I say, Power to the People!</p>

		<p>From what I understand these anarchist/leftist kids are a big problem throughout Europe and they dress up in black and seem to not really have any concrete principles. They&rsquo;re anarchists, who want peace, yet they&rsquo;re an organized, violent bunch who want to destroy their countries. Crazy.</p>

<p>There are plenty of muslims in Greece courtesy of Albanian migrants.  There is also a significant Pakistani population and recently even black Africans have entered the country. </p>

		<p>     It&rsquo;s no coincidence that gun sales have gone through the roof in the states. People are not that stupid. They know the government will not protect them, so they must protect themselves. A few months ago, the two old ladies who live next to me ran screaming from my house when I showed them my pistol and rifle. Last week they asked my advice as to what sort of a weapon they should buy. Real Americans are gearing up for what is coming. The police will be ordered to do nothing and the few rioters who are caught will receive a slap on the wrist. </p>

		<p>A quote from the Associated Press, 3 December 2008</p>
<p>Nearly half of Algeria&rsquo;s young men want to migrate illegally to Europe, a poll published Wednesday suggests. [&hellip;] Half of these said they were &ldquo;certain&rdquo; they&rsquo;d try to leave. The second half said it was &ldquo;likely&rdquo; they would attempt to reach Europe<br>

		<p>There was a protest outside the Greek Consulate in NYC today (12/10/08). They broke the windows. My fiend was there and she reported that these protesters were NOT Greek. They looked Pakistani or Indian (light colored). I guess they are backing the cause of their co-ethnic asylum abusers. A good way to put presure on the Greek government. I was not able to locate any reports of this in the media. It makes me wonder, is this was organized.</p>

<p>This is the way the mas media ( and next US news ) is spinning this story. Didn&rsquo;t make sense, but this does. <br>
Regarding the situation of the U Sin the near future, Biden and MANY other nuts in power have said ther ewill be a &#8216;major problem that will face Obama in his first 6 months in office&rsquo;. What will this be ? Another manufactured terrorist attack, like 911 ? Or Oklahoma City ? Be sure if will further the agenda of the NWO, just like these other events have. Either way. hold onto your guns, literally and get ready for all #$ll to break loose. Maybe it will be a police state coming ot a town or city near you, who knows. It is VERY interesting to note the FEMA camps all over the US and these video camera popping up all over the USA. Be armed and ready, my fellow Americans. </p>
