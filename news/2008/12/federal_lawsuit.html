			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Society for Americans for National Existence (SANE), December 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal lawsuit was filed this morning against U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. and the Federal Reserve Board to stop all bailout funds from going to American International Group, Inc. (&#8220;AIG&#8221;). According to the lawsuit, the U.S. government, through its ownership of AIG, is not only violating the Constitution, but also promoting and financing the destruction of America using American tax dollars.</p>
<p>The basis of the lawsuit is that AIG intentionally promotes Shariah-compliant businesses and insurance products, which by necessity must comply with the 1200 year old body of Islamic cannon law based on the Quran, which demands the conversion, subjugation, or destruction of the infidel West, including the United States. To help achieve these objectives and with the aid of federal tax dollars, AIG employs a three-person Shariah Advisory Board, with members from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Pakistan. According to AIG, the role of its Shariah authority &#8220;is to review [its] operations, supervise its development of Islamic products, and determine Shariah compliance of these products and [its] investments.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, use of taxpayer funds to acquire ownership of a business that intentionally promotes, endorses, supports, and funds Shariah-based Islamic religious practices violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nevertheless, AIG acknowledges and boasts its promotion of Shariah law and Shariah-based business practices. AIG itself describes &#8220;Sharia&#8221; as &#8220;Islamic law based on the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet [Mohammed].&#8221;</p>
<p>In further support of the federal government&rsquo;s endorsement of Shariah, the U.S. Treasury department co-sponsored a seminar in November of this year entitled &#8220;Islamic Financing 101&#8221; to promote Shariah financing among American institutions. The Seminar was jointly sponsored by Harvard University, one of the many American universities and colleges receiving millions of dollars from oil-producing countries to influence their Middle East programs, which are often staffed with professors who are anti-American, anti-Israeli, and pro-Islamic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The federal lawsuit challenges that portion of the &#8220;Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008&#8221; that appropriated $40 billion in taxpayer money to fund and financially support the United States government&rsquo;s majority ownership interest in AIG, which engages in Shariah-based Islamic religious activities that are anti-Christian, anti-Jewish, and anti-American.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, through the use of taxpayer funds, the U.S. government acquired a majority (79.9%) ownership interest in AIG, and as part of the bailout, Congress appropriated and expended an additional $40 billion of taxpayer money to fund and financially support AIG and its financial activities. AIG, which is now a government owned company, engages in Shariah-compliant financing, which subjects certain financial activities, including investments, to the dictates of Islamic law and the Islamic religion. This specifically includes any profits or interest obtained through such financial activities.</p>
<p>An important element of Shariah-compliant financing is a form of obligatory charitable contribution called zakat, which is a religious tax for assisting those that &#8220;struggle [jihad] for Allah.&#8221; The amount of this tax is between 2.5% and 20%, depending upon the source of the wealth. The zakat religious tax is used to financially support Islamic &#8220;charities,&#8221; some of which have ties to terrorist organizations that are hostile to the United States and all other &#8220;infidels,&#8221; which includes Christians and Jews.</p>

		<p>this lawsuit filed against aig will be dismissed. already lawmakers and the justice dept have quietly worked out the details. they will use the argument that american private citizens don&rsquo;t have the right to file such a case. legally, they are correct. what most people also fail to realize that the right to vote is also not a protected right and no where in the constitution does it guanrantee a person such condition. even if not the case, the preisdent, through executive order, can simply change the rules as was the case when it was found hillary clinton would have a problem becmong sec of state. bush simply re-wrote the reg thus allowing her confirmation. state has always had ultimate power but at least in america they gave you the illusion your voice counts. expect obama to quickly dissuade all of you on that notion very quickly after being sworn in. </p>

<p>That wll fail also.  They should be working toward moving to various parts of the country with like-minded people who are planning to secede in the near future.</p>

		<p>You notice how all these companies, once viewed solely as &#8220;American&#8221; companies but who now promote themselves as &#8220;global&#8221; companies, turn to the American taxpayer for financial help?  Let hem go to China, India or Saudi Arabia for financial help.  Sine you have no loyalty or allegiance to Americans, don&rsquo;t ask us for help!</p>

		<p>Will anything happen to AIG higher-ups for taking the bailout money and running to vacation at everyone&rsquo;s expense? </p>
<p>Their arrogance is the typical by-product of Muslims&rsquo; intent on world conquest. </p>

		<p>Communism was a failure.</p>
<p>Capitalism is now a failure.</p>
<p>The common thread is corrupt officials.</p>
<p>Any organized system can be made to work if there are honest people pulling the strings.</p>
<p>But when there is nothing but corruption and greed in both systems, this is what you get.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Time&#8221; magazine reported this last month that AIG executives, on receiving word of the bailout, immediately paid themselves $500 million in year-end bonuses.  They &#8220;deserve&#8221; that money, because they&rsquo;ve been doing such a &#8220;good&#8221; job.</p>
