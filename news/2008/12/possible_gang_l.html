			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tony Perry and Patrick McGreevy, Los Angeles Times, December 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Esteban Nuñez, the son of former California Assembly Speaker Fabian Nuñez, and three other men who were arrested in the fatal stabbing of a college student in San Diego fit the definition of a criminal street gang, police said in search warrants released Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nuñez and his companions identified themselves as members of The Hazard Crew or THC, according to the documents. THC is an abbreviation for the active chemical ingredient in marijuana. Nuñez, 19, has a biohazard symbol on his right arm, and the other defendants have similar tattoos, police said.</p>
<p>Hours before the Oct. 4 killing, Nuñez and another defendant talked about how they had learned to gang up on victims and take turns punching them, a woman told police.</p>
<p>The four men are accused of murder in the death of 22-year-old Luis Dos Santos, a Mesa College student, after a night of drinking at a party near San Diego State University.</p>
<p>San Diego Police Capt. Jim Collins said the defendants, all from the Sacramento area, did not know Santos but taunted him and four friends, then attacked them with knives.</p>
<p>The fatal fight allegedly took only 30 seconds. Santos died of a single stab wound to the heart, collapsing in front of the campus gym. Nuñez told his friends that, if they were charged, his father could get them off on a self-defense argument, according to court documents.</p>
<p>The picture of Nuñez that police presented Wednesday contrasts sharply with how others who know the Sacramento City College business student describe him.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a longtime friend of the Nuñez family, said: &#8220;I&rsquo;ve known him since he was a little boy. He&rsquo;s a great kid, a good boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vanessa Huber of Upland, another close family friend, echoed the mayor&rsquo;s comments: &#8220;He&rsquo;s a good kid. I&rsquo;ve never heard him raise his voice about anything. I&rsquo;m so shocked. I don&rsquo;t know what to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Sunday, Nuñez&rsquo;s father finished the last of his three terms in the Assembly, representing a district that extends from Boyle Heights to downtown Los Angeles. He also served four years as speaker, pushing through landmark legislation on environmental and labor issues. After a spike in gang violence in Los Angeles, he wrote a bill last year that created a state office to oversee efforts to reduce gang violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Esteban Nuñez graduated from Rio Americano High School near Sacramento in 2007, said a school spokesman. He also went to Christian Brothers High School in Sacramento and Damien High School in LaVerne, his MySpace profile indicates.</p>
<p>The athletic director at Christian Brothers, Jill Bennett, recalled that Nuñez and his sister were at the private school for only a short time and that he was a &#8220;fairly quiet&#8221; student.</p>
<p>On his MySpace page, Nuñez listed his heroes as farmworker organizer Cesar Chavez and rapper Tupac Shakur. His favorite movies include &#8220;Scarface&#8221; and &#8220;Gang Related.&#8221; Much of the material was removed from the site Wednesday.</p>

		<p>Villaraigosa,&#8221;he&rsquo;s a great kid, a good boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Villaraigosa spent his &#8220;college days&#8221; vandalizing and causing trouble at UCLA while protesting for &#8220;Latino rights&#8221;,(this from a guy who was on the affirmative action gravy train), so his definition of a &#8220;good boy&#8221; might be somewhat skewed. I won&rsquo;t even go into the fact that he has spent an enormous amount of time as a politician defending latino gangs.(black or the very few white gangs there are, he doesn&rsquo;t bother defending) We are truly living in a nation on its way to third world status.</p>

<p>Yes, now is there any chance we can convince you to go back to Mexico and take your &#8220;good boy&#8221; with you?</p>
<p>I mean, if that&rsquo;s the reaction from Mexicans surely you would be happier in a country where the population thinks murderers are good boys wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Or, maybe you could go to Africa.  They have some openings there by people who share your enthusiasm for murderers in Zimbabwe and South Africa.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m suggesting relocation is because with the attitude you have displayed so far you&rsquo;re going to be pretty miserable living here.  These Gringos just don&rsquo;t think like that.</p>

		<p>If the man killed had drawn a weapon and shot Nunez in self defense, then we would still be hearing about &#8220;What a good boy he was, except there would be calls for more gun control and prosecution of the victim. </p>

		<p>What does it say about LA to have a thug like Villaraigosa for a Mayor. He&rsquo;s right up there with Sharpe James, Marion Barry and Kwame Kilpatrick. I read somewhere that &#8220;Villraigosa&#8221; is not actually his real surname but rather an alias made up later.<br>

<p>When I was a teenager, I remember it was pleasant having several buddies to hang out with and do things with.</p>
<p>And somehow, just having a good time together was enough. We never felt a need to go beat up someone, or stab someone, to affirm our enjoyment of each other&rsquo;s company.</p>

		<p>This caught my eye:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;Nuñez, 19, has a biohazard symbol on his right arm&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As an FYI, the biohazard symbol tatoo is used openly (and by choice) in the gay community to identify HIV.  If you see a gay guy with this tatoo you can rest assured that he is HIV positive.  </p>

		<p>From the story:<br>
&#8220;Nuñez was born in Pomona. His father grew up in &hellip;Tijuana and San Diego, <i>one of 12 children of immigrant parents</i> <br>
He became the political director for the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and a lobbyist for the Los Angeles Unified School District.&#8221;</p>
<p>Were those &#8220;immigrant parents&#8221; illegals?   Just one more reason to deport ALL ilegals AND their children!</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this said of everyone, good-doer or ill-doer? There are only great kids, good boys. However, there are differences between some great kids, good boys and others, like, for instance, some great kids, good boys being murderers, and some not being.</p>

		<p>Look at some of these kids&rsquo; myspace pages.  They are absolutely obsessed with black rappers.  Yet, they also espouse &#8220;brown pride.&#8221;  I remember when Malcom X came out when I was a kid and all the Mexican kids at school starting wearing those Africa necklaces.   It&rsquo;s quite bizarre really.  I noticed that all these Mexican gang kids attached to Nunez are really into to Tupac, who has got to be one of the more harmless rappers/gangsters.  He&rsquo;s like &#8220;rap lite&#8221; for white suburban kids.  </p>
<p>Do these guys get how ridiculous they are?</p>

<p>I wish I had a dime for every time I heard or saw a black mother of a black juvenile or young adult criminal suspect arrested, who told the local MSM in St. Louis that her son &#8220;was a good boy, an honor roll student, and a good &#8216;afawete&rsquo; who just happened to get caught up with the wrong crowd.&#8221;  If that&rsquo;s the canard used for all of them, if they&rsquo;re all good boyz who just happened to fall in with the wrong crowd, then who pray tell is the wrong crowd?</p>
<p>Simple answer:  Mama, your boy WAS the &#8220;wrong crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yeah, from one low IQd puppet to another. Is this not proof that each generation of hispanic immigrants fares worse than the previous generation?</p>
<p>Nunez pere is fond of spouting off about mexicans taking over California, taking over the US, about this being the &#8216;bronze&rsquo; continent, mexicans eventually gaining &#8216;full control&rsquo; and other standard issue la raza rants.</p>

<p>And, in case you missed it, Villar (his real name) and Nunez were &#8216;sharing&rsquo; reporter Mirthala Salinas  &mdash;  </p>

<p>Santos&rsquo;s distraught father was on John and Ken last night  &mdash;  reminded me of listening to Fred Goldman speak about his murdered son.  Apparently the son of nunez bragged that he would &#8216;take the rap&rsquo; because his father is a big shot in California and will be able to &#8216;get him off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have as much sympathy for this racist and his family as I do for the recently convicted OJ  &mdash;  let justice serve nunez fils and his &#8216;posse.&rsquo;  Let&rsquo;s hope he rots in jail for life (let me on the jury!).</p>
