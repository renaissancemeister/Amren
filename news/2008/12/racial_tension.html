For Immediate Release</p>

<p>Interracial and interethnic interactions can often be awkward and stressful for members of both majority and minority groups. People bring certain expectations to their interactions with members of different groups &mdash; they often expect that these interactions will be awkward and less successful in establishing positive, long-lasting relationships than interactions with members of one&rsquo;s own racial or ethnic group.</p>
<p>These expectations can cause people to interpret the vague comments and behaviors of others more negatively in intergroup situations, further confirming their negative perceptions of these interactions. Research has suggested that apprehensive behaviors such as brief hesitations may often be a result of anxiety experienced in intergroup interactions.</p>
<p>However, Yale University psychologist Adam R. Pearson along with his colleagues from the University of Connecticut wanted to know if the opposite was true: Can brief hesitations in conversation (often associated with anxiety) actually cause interracial tension?</p>
<p>In this study, subjects engaged in one-on-one conversations via closed-circuit television with someone of the same (intragroup) or different (intergroup) racial background. Unbeknownst to the participants, half of the conversations occurred with a brief delay &mdash; equipment was used to delay auditory and visual feedback for one second throughout the conversation. This delay was subtle and was not consciously detected by the participants. The remaining conversations occurred in real time, with no delay. Following the conversation, participants independently completed questionnaires about their experience, rating their feelings and those of their partners.</p>
<p>The results, reported in the December issue of Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, revealed that a mere one second delay in conversation was sufficient to raise anxiety in intergroup but not intragroup interactions. Both whites and minorities in the delayed intergroup conversation felt more anxious and viewed their partners as being more anxious compared to participants who engaged in conversations in real time. In addition, participants in the delayed intergroup conversation indicated less interest in getting to know their partners. Surprisingly, participants in intragroup conversations reported feeling even less anxious in the delayed conversation than they did when interacting in real time and were unaffected by the delay when it came to wanting to get to know their partner.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that ingroup members are given a &#8220;benefit of the doubt&#8221; following a brief delay in conversation. However, this courtesy is not extended to members of other racial or ethnic groups. In addition, these results offer direct experimental evidence of just how fragile intergroup relations are when people are first getting acquainted. This study also provides some insight into why it is that attempting to regulate our behavior to ease tension in interracial interactions can sometimes backfire.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that this can introduce delays in the natural flow of conversation which can further contribute to anxiety of all members involved in the interaction. The authors conclude that &#8220;the findings may also have direct practical implications for understanding the persistence of racial and ethnic disparities across a wide variety of contexts, including law enforcement, employment and legal settings, where appearing apprehensive may place members of racial and ethnic outgroups at a distinct disadvantage.&#8221;</p>

We evolved in different places and under different conditions over eons. It&rsquo;s only right and natural that we act different and we have difficulty bridging the &#8216;different-gap&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Meeting strangers of ones own people can be awkward. I can see cross-racial meetings being even more so. From experience, I can say I am aware and act differently around people who are not like me. And with blacks in particular, there&rsquo;s always tension as I try to be consciously aware of what ques they&rsquo;re sending and what I&rsquo;m sending back. It makes interactions with blacks a difficult and draining experience and something I try to avoid.</p>

		<p>We need to be alert to subtleties of categorization by researchers. The article says the &#8220;benefit of the doubt&#8221; is a courtesy not extended to members of other racial or ethnic groups.<br>
But the more negative feelings in the diverse group can be categorized in all kinds of ways, for instance, they can be categorized as showing that diverse groups have more tension, and this affects the thought processes going on in the brains of the participants, which in turn feeds into negative feelings generated from delays.<br>
The trouble with the researchers talking about &#8220;benefit of the doubt&#8221; is it aids yet more political correctness and yet more burden that people must work harder to be &#8220;politically correct.&#8221; </p>
<p>(A) An essential requirement of science is non-judgmental neutrality. I believe the researchers using the term &#8220;benefit of the doubt&#8221; is (B) not at all neutral. If you accept A and B, then it follows tautologically that the researchers are not engaged in science when they use the term &#8220;benefit of the doubt.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Quick answer, those delays are pauses for thinking.<br>
And we probably pause to consider our responses more so when dealing with someone from a alien background. <br>
Out of politeness, political correctness or simply trying to make your communication tailored for the recipient, to be effective and/or respectful. </p>
<p>I was briefly a salesman working door to door.<br>
And in that field the best salespeople would watch the &#8216;marks&rsquo;<br>
eye movements along with the tempo of their speech. To tell when the potential sale was mentally considering the offer, thus was receptive to &#8216;the close&rsquo;.<br>
It was something like, when they&rsquo;d look left with their pupils they were accessing the creative left hemisphere of their brain, thus they were &#8216;making it up&rsquo;/lying (speaking to someone in law enforcement told me that they watch for the same thing when conducting street interviews). <br>
And when they&rsquo;d look right, they&rsquo;d be accessing their concise right hemisphere of the brain for actual memories (another left/right political analogy).<br>
And of course the pause was them constructing what they were about to say CONSCIOUSLY. <br>
The best sales people would look straight ahead with their pupils (not dominant but confident in expression) and speak with no &#8216;thinking&rsquo; pauses in their speech, to demonstrate confidence in what you were trying convince this other party of. <br>
And the only way you could speak this way, is if you had learned your spiel SUBCONSCIOUSLY through repetition over and over, thus no conscious thought would be  required when reciting your spiel. <br>
And again the best salesmen were so good at this it was like watching someone be hypnotized .<br>
You would only be able to do this after you have mirrored your target (showing them that you are just like them with similar tone of voice, tempo and use of language), after mirroring you&rsquo;d lead them to the visual/mental place you&rsquo;d want them to be at and then wait for that pause &#8216;of consideration&rsquo; (while watching pupils of the eyes for dilation).</p>
<p><br>
I am curious to what the point of this study is?<br>
Is it the &ldquo;we are equal but different brigade&rdquo; trying to help understand further why these misunderstandings occur, as to explain (makes excuses again).<br>
Whilst adding another tool for the eventual goal of removing these misunderstandings, or &#8216;curing us&rsquo; through subconscious learning, (brainwashing) away further our naturally cautious instincts.<br>
Haven&rsquo;t they done enough already.</p>
<p>PS On a less critical note &#8216;Merry Christmas fellow Race Realists&rsquo;!<br>

		<p>I daresay that these same reactions would have been noted between mainstream whites and their interactions with white prison inmates. The presumption that blacks (and this what this article means when it says non-whites) are hugely overrepresented in the violent criminal class is factually well-founded.  Anybody of any race (including law-abiding blacks) has good reason to be leery of black strangers.</p>

		<p>Listen to a group of blacks discussing WHITES where you can do so unobserved. I guaratee you will have a new understanding of the word RACIST. You don&rsquo;t even have to go stealth, all you have to do is find the (ALL) black radio stations out of places like Atlanta. They are easily found on the internet and you&rsquo;re in for a rude awakening an and education you will find hard to believe. WHITES would be arrested for making  some of the comments, they will hear </p>

		<p>I have the perfect solution to tensions in interracial conversations. I AVOID having any more to do with or say to Blacks than absolutely necessary! Thus I don&rsquo;t have to concern myself about awkward racial tensions. Works fine for me!</p>

		<p>So then, it seems that people of the same race and background feel more comfortable, and communicate better, with those of their own kind.   </p>
<p>This is news?</p>
<p>The one bit of information gleaned is that Diversity increases tension and misunderstanding (and this isn&rsquo;t news either).</p>

		<p>&#8220;a mere one second delay in conversation was sufficient to raise anxiety&#8221;<br>
This is the garbage that passes as science! This is a &#8220;scientist&#8221; forming preconceived conclusions on the basis of an &#8220;experiment&#8221; that has no valid or real explanation.<br>
Of course an artificial unnatural break in the conversation gives anxiety! <br>
This is not &#8220;hesitation.&#8221; It&rsquo;s monkeying with speech so that it sounds unnatural to the listener!<br>
Of course that produces anxiety!<br>
Scientists? Not by a long shot.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure that&rsquo;s true. The average white person probably has more to fear from a middle class or upper class black than they do from an ex-con white. Nowadays though there are more and more whites who are a danger because they completely mentally unbalanced. Of course, that&rsquo;s why most of us are here on AmRen in the first place.</p>

Hell, Africans in their own African lands never amounted to anything on their own.
