<h1>Their Year of Buying Black</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cheryl V. Jackson, Chicago Sun-Times, December 20, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Consumers worldwide might be tightening their belts, but Maggie Anderson&rsquo;s mind is black with plots to spend.</p>
<p>Her Oak Park family is publicly committing to a year of buying from black-owned business and supporting black professionals exclusively, starting Jan. 1.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her family&rsquo;s efforts will be followed by a team of college researchers as part of a project called the Ebony Experiment to determine the impact of the Andersons&rsquo; spending if extrapolated to a larger portion of black America.</p>
<p>Proponents of buy-black initiatives say they are key to community prosperity, as studies indicate black-owned enterprises are more likely to hire black employees. Those firms are likely to sponsor community programs and their owners participate in institutions such as churches that provide community services, said Steven Rogers, director of the Kellogg Entrepreneurial Practice Center at Northeastern University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Management.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Andersons, who plan to spend about $10,000 a month next year, will move their checking account to and refinance home and car loans with black organizations. They&rsquo;ll seek black-owned firms to do home improvement projects and handle vacations they&rsquo;ve put off until next year.</p>
<p>And they want black America to watch as they discover companies with which to do business.</p>
<p>The couple  &mdash;  she&rsquo;s a lawyer; he&rsquo;s a financial adviser  &mdash;  will blog and post videos at EbonyExperiment.com to document their spending, and invite people to offer their own accounts of shopping black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Coming out of the project will be a database of black-owned businesses and professionals and a university-based study. Social commentator Michael Eric Dyson is on the team and will pen the foreword for a book detailing the experience.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Michael Bennett, director of DePaul University&rsquo;s Egan Urban Center and a researcher helping to measure the Anderson impact, said this effort stands out from the loads of buy-black initiatives he has seen over his 64 years.</p>

		<p>This is a great idea. I&rsquo;ve been saying for a long time now that Blacks should create their own institutions and systems, wrather than leaching off of ours. Integration is the enemy of the White Race, so any thing that separates the races is good. Since the majority of privately owned White Buisnesses secretly prefer not to have Blacks in their establishments, I really don&rsquo;t see what harm this does.</p>

		<p>I know most of you will pick up on this, but note the ingratitude of two affirmative action darlings starting an effort to buy only black.  Had white college administrators and employers at a certain time had the same attitude for themselves, these Andersons wouldn&rsquo;t be in a position to spend $10,000 a month.</p>

		<p>EXCELLENT IDEA!</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t stop short&hellip;go the full nine yards.</p>
<p>They should not work jobs in businesses owned by whites. They should all quit their jobs and go to work for other black people.<br>
Blacks should only work for other blacks.</p>
<p>They should not live in houses owned by whites either. They need to move out of their rent house and find one owned by a black person. Blacks should only pay rent to other blacks!</p>
<p>They should not use any inventions of the white man or buy anything the white man invented. They should throw out or sell everything that whites invented. Blacks should only use things invented by other blacks!</p>
<p>They should only do business with black professionals, just like the article says. Only black doctors, black nurses, black accountants, black engineers, black dentists&hellip;..you got the right idea. Blacks need to only pay money to black professionals!</p>
<p>Blacks should only have sex with other black people. (You know she would want that too.) No more white girl friends, no more raping white women, and no more white prostitutes. In fact, they should have nothing at all to do with white people&hellip;.and that includes crime too. No more black on white crime. Confine robberies and theft to other black people. No more stealing from whitey. </p>
<p>How else will they ever have any self respect??????<br>

There&rsquo;s always a great deal of talk about black spending power; as if blacks stopped spending, they would shut down the economy (this is usually brought up in a veiled threat to curtail spending of a &#8216;racist&rsquo; business).</p>
<p>What I never hear about is white spending power. If blacks are only 13% of the US population, how much power do whites have?</p>
<p>If anyone has the numbers comparing black and white spending power, please post.</p>

		<p>OK, go to the site.  It&rsquo;s really clear this is yet another way to promote the exact opposite of diversity and for propped-up, fabricated reasons.  Turn your sound down, they force you to hear a few notes of music with each page change with no way to turn it off.  On the purpose page you find this:<br>
&#8220;The Ebony Experiment exists because we are not doing enough as a community to support Black business. The plight and potential of Black entrepreneurs and professionals are virtually absent from the national dialogue. We believe they are key to creating and stimulating longâ€“term wealth in Black communities&hellip; because Black businesses create the most Black jobs, they respect and understand Black consumers and investors, and the swelling pool of Black professionals drives growth of the Black middle class.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 3rd run-on sentence we read &#8220;Black businesses create the most Black jobs&#8221; which is total and utter untruth.  Most black people are employed by the same people who employ most of everyone, white-owned businesses and white-run corporations.</p>
<p>In the same sentence we see &#8220;they respect and understand Black consumers and investors&#8221; which may be true.  But understanding them isn&rsquo;t complicated as evidenced by target marketing of malt liquor, lard, menthol cigarettes and of course the music.  The people who promote the music genre that has more black kids killing each other than any other factor, are black.  Black artists and media are telling black kids to off each other, and they are doing it.  This is respect for their race?</p>
<p>and lastly we have &#8220;the swelling pool of Black professionals drives growth of the Black middle class&#8221;.  Swelling pool?  With a drop-out rate exceeding 60%?  America has more Asian engineers than black ones!</p>
<p>So this &#8220;experiment&#8221; is just a propaganda tool that uses misrepresentation to give black Americans a sense of false pride in an effort to keep them from becoming true Americans.  After all, diversity and assimilation are only cool if white folks aren&rsquo;t around.  Right?  Grow up black Americans.</p>

		<p>  I sure hope it works out for them. Maybe the malls will be a safe place to shop if they all leave. But then, they will probably get free rent at the malls just so they don&rsquo;t leave. The only thing any and all minorities contribute to any mall/shopping area is crime. They don&rsquo;t buy a damn thing.</p>

		<p>Are they going to confine their stealing to businesses owned by black people as well?  That would be a lovely deal for businesses owned by other races.  Have you ever worked retail?  Blacks in the store are nothing but trouble.  They are mad if they get attention.  They are mad if they don&rsquo;t get attention.  They are a theft or a lawsuit waiting to happen every time they come in the store.  I would love to own a business that black customers wanted nothing to do with.  </p>

		<p>Sounds good on the surface. Build up the Black business class and all that. Freedom to contract&hellip; let them do it. But: Blacks do not want to do business with Blacks. As a Black business owner once told me: &#8220;to the Black man the white man&rsquo;s ice is always colder&#8221;. Also, the market rules and Blacks want to shop at the white majority malls and stores. They are not going to stay at a ghetto motel when they travel because of all the crack dealers and prostitutes and all.  <br>
From the black business owner, particularly say, a small grocer, the problems are immense. First, they cannot compete on price. Second, I have been told that customers come in and, ask for credit because the customer is a &#8220;brother&#8221;. Of course, if the store did extend the credit, the customer would probably not return to that store. </p>

		<p>All White businesses should post lists and locations of all these african businesses outside their own premises and encourage blacks to go there with all there shopping needs. Create a great public awareness and offer free publicity so there can be no doubt about wanting to support this excellent idea. Keep it alive on local radio and newspapers. Give full encouragement and never criticize in anyway whatsoever. Perhaps Michael Bennett would care to elaborate on his claim that he has seen loads of such initiatives over his 64 years and let us all know just how successful they have been, knowing just how loyal, supportive and valuable black customers can be to these black ventures. Well, to be fair to the man, he didn&rsquo;t actually state that any had failed, did he? Anyway, with a black financial advisor and a black lawyer heading up the idea, how can it fail? Who volunteers to give AMREN a progress report, say after the first quarter 2009? Note in diaries please, make that for the 1st of the 4th month.</p>

<p>While the noble &#8216;ebony experiment&rsquo; goes on, those white or publicly owned businesses will be targeted for lawsuits and &#8216;diversity&rsquo; programs and for properly sensitive community outreach and advertising campaigns. For perspective, why not just call the whole USA &#8216;the ebony experiment&rsquo;? </p>

		<p>This makes me think of an instance that happened to me about 20 years ago. I was working in my family owned car dealership and was waiting on a middle age black lady about repairing her car. She kept asking questions about the mechanics we had. I didnt know what she was eluding to but finally she said that she only wanted her car worked on by a white mechanic only, no black mechanic. Apparently she had had negative experiences with her own kind. Over the years I have also had conversations with other blacks eluding to the quality of work done by black technitions in other fields. If you get to really know a black, and since 62% of my city is black I get this wonderful opportunity more than I would like,, deep down, they know but wont often admit of the superiority of whites.

		<p>I work in Commercial Real Estate and can pick and choose my own clients. I don&rsquo;t work for blacks. Ever. </p>
<p>It has been my experience that in the Real Estate industry where reputation and word of honor are necessary, Blacks will destroy a Whites reputation or break their word, just for fun. Every colleague I have who has tried to work for a black, with millions of dollars on the line, has had a bitter time.</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;finally she said that she only wanted her car worked on by a white mechanic only, no black mechanic. Apparently she had had negative experiences with her own kind.</i></p>
<p>I listen to local black radio and one host is a big proponent of supporting black businesses. He was talking about how he hired blacks to do home improvements. He complained bitterly about their poor skill levels and how he had to watch them every second.</p>
<p>Blacks like him want to support black business but they run head-on into the same situation whites do; too many blacks produce shoddy work and have little concern for quality or customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also reminded of an editorial in the Buffalo News written by their resident &#8216;angry black man&rsquo; who complained about the closing of a chain grocery store in the black community. He also complained bitterly about the poor customer service from the black employees and management. Even so, he ended up blaming the suits for not providing the staff with better training. I&rsquo;m thinking, &#8216;they have their grocery store in their neighborhood staffed and managed by blacks and yet they blame everyone but themselves. They blame the white man that the black workers are rude and inattentive and the quality of the store was so deplorable it was forced to close. The MAN put the store in their community but it&rsquo;s the MANS&rsquo; fault that blacks couldn&rsquo;t run it properly&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As I always say, when dealing with blacks, it&rsquo;s lose-lose. Even when you go out of your way to help them, they still turn around and strike back. And after being bitten multiple times, they wonder why whites don&rsquo;t want to deal with them. It&rsquo;s not ignorance of blacks that fuels racial awareness, it&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>Your only defense is to avoid them if you can. No interactions, no problems.<br>

<p>I think that whites should tell blacks that they are very welcome to &#8220;buy black&#8221; both now and after we work together to form our separate nations .</p>

		<p>The home-improvement projects seem a bit two-dimensional to me, so to speak.  Sure, the Andersons can find black contractors to do the work, but where will the materials come from?  The big home-improvement chains like Home Depot and Lowe&rsquo;s have driven the smaller &#8220;mom &amp; pop&#8221; hardware stores out of business in much of the US.  Where will the materials be produced?  I wouldn&rsquo;t even begin to know where to look for a black-owned sawmill, carpet factory or floor tile kiln.</p>
<p>I have to agree with Grob Hahn; this is only a propaganda puff piece.</p>

		<p>I have no problem whatsoever with this idea.  It is only natural for people to want to support others of their same race.  I do the same thing myself.  If I&rsquo;m hiring a contractor to do any work I only used white-owned companies that employ non-immigrant labor; also, instead of shopping at mega-retailers, I try to find local, white-owned stores.<br>
Personally, I hope this trend catches on.  If blacks start buying only from black-owned enterprises then white-owned companies will be more willing to cater to white customers because they will not have to worry about offending and losing non-existent black customers.  No more Black History Month displays, no more rude black customers to deal with, no more affirmative action hiring policies.  Who knows, maybe they&rsquo;ll even start flying the Confederate flag out front - a few stores in the South already do that.</p>

		<p>What I never hear about is white spending power. If blacks are only 13% of the US population, how much power do whites have?</p>
<p>If anyone has the numbers comparing black and white spending power, please post.</p>
<p>Posted by sbuffalonative at 7:02 PM on December 22 </p>
<p>Depending on the product, blacks sometimes do have more spending power than whites.  I read somewhere that blacks consume half of all soft drinks in the country which explains why companies like Pepsi pay rapers like Ludacris to make ads.<br>
I think there are two main reasons why companies seem to cater to blacks:<br>
1) Blacks are much more susceptible to advertising than whites.  Even if blacks only make up a small percentage of your customer base, it makes sense to direct your advertising at them.  This is just good business sense - get more &#8220;bang for your buck.&#8221; <br>
2) Also, despite their lower average incomes, blacks actually have more spending power than whites for several reasons.  First of all, most white people have a large amount of their income tied up in homes.  Blacks, on the other hand, - since they can live in black neighborhoods where you can buy a house for at least 5 times less than a comparable home in a white neighborhood - have more money freed up for consumer spending.  Blacks also tend to not save near as much money as whites and, therefore, spend a higher percentage of their income. <br>
Also, as one person already pointed out.  A lot of black spending is in the red.  Blacks are notoriously bad for abusing credit.  A white person who only makes $3,000 a month will only spend about $2500 a month whereas a black who only makes $3,000 a month will spend $4,000 a month.  I&rsquo;ve seen it happen with my own eyes.  I used to work at a restaurant and we had black cooks making $8 an hour driving luxury SUVs.</p>

		<p>I live in a white flight exurb&hellip;.soon to be a suburb&hellip;.in a predominantly black region.  All the retailers are frantic to move to our little burg.  I go into a lot of meetings with developers and retail design teams.  </p>
<p>Nobody will admit to much. But over a couple of years, it has been communicated to me, in bits and pieces, that while blacks spend as much as whites, it is simply too costly to deal with them.</p>
<p>Shoplifting is the most obvious problem.  But then, there&rsquo;s black employee collusion with black shoplifters.  A developer, in a rare moment of candor, spelled it out: &#8220;Keisha steals the item, and hands it to LaShondra, who reads it out of stock, and then hands it to D&rsquo;Vontaay, who&hellip;&#8221;.  It was too complicated for me to follow, but a crucial ingredient was the black shopper.  </p>
<p>And then there are the lawsuits.  Any incident, from conveniently slipping in a puddle, to being attacked in the parking lot, is a &#8216;reason&rsquo; to sue.  Last month, a metro retailer exposed a (black) man who claimed to have been robbed in their parking lot (but who hadn&rsquo;t).  The man was trying to sue the store over their lack of security.  </p>
<p>Which brings me to security.  You need lots of security, if you have lots of black customers.  One Saturday we were touring (very black) Port Gibson, Mississippi.  We needed a phone book, and tried five different convenience stores.  All had been stolen, both from the inside payphones and those outside.  What astounded us is that every single convenience store had an armed guard inside, and one outside.  How on earth does one stay in business with that kind of overhead?</p>
<p>But mostly, I suspect, it&rsquo;s the little things, like whether a customer leaves her shopping cart in the &#8216;cart corral&rsquo;, or whether she abuses the store&rsquo;s return policy.  And it cannot be good for business when black moms allow their children to continually emit ear-splitting screams inside the store.</p>
<p>Here in the &#8216;Ark-La-Miss&rsquo;, virtually no towns still have cinemas.  People have to drive for hours, to some predominately white place, just to go to the movies.  Black behavior has driven customers, both black and white, from most movie houses.</p>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s transaction time.  Last week at a grocery in the city, I spent an easy fifteen minutes behind a young black man (with four items) who was too messed up to use his credit card, or his discount card, and who kept changing his mind.  This is not rare.  And heaven forbid you should go to a drugstore in New Orleans, where the black ahead of you in line will take ten minutes to buy two items.  It&rsquo;s like being in a zombie movie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our family only buys fron White companies and hires only Whites. I suggest everyone here do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pray tell, what &#8220;White companies&#8221; are still out there?  What companies are owned exclusively by Whites and have no one but Whites on the payroll?  Unless you&rsquo;re referring to Mom &amp; Pop type establishments&hellip;.</p>
<p>True story: many years ago my late father owned a small business out on Long Island, NY that did subcontracting work for the Federal gov&rsquo;t.  He had 10 employees (who were all White) and his business was good.</p>
<p>One day the EEOC sent an agent to his office who demanded to know why he had no non-White employees.  My father retorted that whenever he needed to hire someone he simply put an ad in the local paper.  Whoever showed up with the qualifications got the job.  Besides, where his business was located there were no non-Whites (which was true at the time).</p>
<p>No problem, said the agent.  The agency would PROVIDE two blacks (even though they weren&rsquo;t needed).  They even sent an agent by daily for a week to make sure their &#8220;civil rights&#8221; were protected!  After a week the agent told my father he could fire them if he wished because they were the &#8220;laziest, stupidest dolts he had ever seen&#8221; (his exact words, by the way)!  However, they continued to insist he hire more non-Whites.</p>
<p>After hiring (and firing) a total of 12 black employees (all for the same reason: indolence), my father finally hired a couple of Orientals who kept to themselves but did their jobs.  That appeared to make the gov&rsquo;t happy.  He told me if they ever tried to make him hire blacks again, he&rsquo;d simply shut down his business.</p>
<p>The moral of this story?  Race-exclusive initiatives are only for non-Whites.</p>
<p>As for this &#8220;Ebony Experiment&#8221;?  Like all other &#8220;experiments&#8221; aimed at &#8220;empowering&#8221; blacks it will go the way of the Dodo bird.  History (and IQ tests) clearly show that blacks, left to their own devices, cannot create anything remotely resembling a modern society or economic infrastructure.</p>

<p> Good post. What you say is true. It just isn&rsquo;t worth it to try to do business with blacks. Too much trouble. When My brother and I worked at a sports and recreation center blacks caused all kinds of problems. blacks were about 15-20% of the clientele. My job included janitorial duties like sweeping up litter - about 90% of which would just be dumped on the floor by blacks although we had garbage cans all around the place. My brother would work behind the concession stand. A black would come up and want a candy bar or bag of potato chips etc, then suddenly change his/her mind and want another item and stand there - endlessly thinking about it (like it was a really major decision  oe something) - meanwhile a dozen people would be waiting behind the guy to order something. Black groups would always show up late for their events but demand their full time (and often more) disrupting the whole daily timemtable of events. The blacks caused more trouble by far then all the other people put together. Also if you&rsquo;ve ever hired or been involved with private contracting the work black crews did on homes was generally terrible. I would never have used these guys on my property. YOU GET what you pay for.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Have you ever worked retail? Blacks in the store are nothing but trouble. They are mad if they get attention. They are mad if they don&rsquo;t get attention. They are a theft or a lawsuit waiting to happen every time they come in the store.&#8221;</p>
<p>Same with restaurants. If they&rsquo;re not walking out on the check, they&rsquo;re trying to set up a lawsuit.  A favorite trick is to go to a deep pockets chain like Red Lobster or Coco&rsquo;s on friday or saturday night around 8/pm, the height of the weekend dinner hour.  7 or 8 blacks will arrive with no reservations.  Naturally they have to wait until the 2 tables are empty and can be pushed together to accommodate 8 people.</p>
<p>Then they file a lawsuit because they had to wait.</p>

<p>I worked with blacks for 40 horrible years.  I saw that time and time again.  One white man I worked with said not a word all day for many years because he knew blacks would twist anything he said and claim he was a racist.</p>
<p>Another white man learned that the blacks were spreading the word that he was a user of steriods and other illegal drugs.  He paid for a blood test every 2 weeks for months.  Then, when he was called in by the supervisor to discuss the matter of his so called drug addiction he was able to bring with him 17 months worth of bi-weekly drug tests showing he was free of illegal drugs.</p>
<p>If you work with blacks, they will conspire, intrigue and lie to get you in trouble and or fired.  It was done to me many times. I saw it done to other whites.</p>
