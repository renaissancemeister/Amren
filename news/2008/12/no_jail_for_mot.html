<h1>No Jail for Mother Who Admits Swarmings, Lawyer Argues</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Seymour, Ottawa Citizen, Dec. 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An &ldquo;extremely troubled and disturbed&rdquo; young mother who participated in a pair of swarmings two years ago should receive house arrest instead of a jail time to allow her to look after her newborn infant, a defence lawyer argued Monday.</p>
<p>Adil Mohamed Omer, 22, pleaded guilty in August to two counts of robbery and one of assault for her role in the swarmings, which occurred about 70 minutes apart at the Rideau Centre and Place d&rsquo;Orléans shopping malls on Nov. 14, 2006.</p>
<p>Court heard that Ms. Omer was among a group of six young women of Somali descent who attacked Chanel Marcotte as she sat on a bench in the mall, punching, kicking and pulling her hair before one of the women stole her cellphone and wallet at about 4:50 p.m.</p>
<p>The group, which included Ms. Omer, then travelled to Place d&rsquo;Orléans by bus, where they cornered two more young women near some garbage bins before attempting to steal one of the women&rsquo;s purses at about 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Court heard that the victim, Jamie Kennedy, was punched and had her hair pulled when she went after the person who stole her purse. Ms. Kennedy, who struck one of her attackers in the head with the handbag, was able to escape when a passerby intervened.</p>
<p>According to a summary of the facts read into court, the second robbery was part of a plan hatched by Ms. Omer and the other women to target a &ldquo;white girl&rdquo; from Orléans &ldquo;because they were rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With her four-month-old baby girl sleeping quietly in a stroller in the front row of the courtroom, Ms. Omer apologized Monday to Ms. Marcotte for the harm she caused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to say I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you like that,&rdquo; Ms. Omer told Ms. Marcotte, who sat in the front row on the opposite side of the courtroom crying softly.</p>
<p>Geraldine Castle-Trudel, who represents Ms. Omer, argued the young mother should receive a conditional sentence of two years less a day to be served in the community, including one year of house arrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I have a kid, a lot of things have changed,&rdquo; Ms. Omer said when given a chance to address the court.</p>
<p>But assistant Crown attorney Matt Humphreys argued an eight- to 10-month jail sentence was more appropriate for the &ldquo;violent&rdquo; offences committed against complete strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ms. Marcotte and the other victims are entitled to enjoy a day at the mall,&rdquo; said Mr. Humphreys, who described Ms. Omer as the &ldquo;main aggressor&rdquo; during the swarming at the Rideau Centre.</p>
<p>Mr. Humphreys said the robbery and beating have had a &ldquo;terrible impact&rdquo; on Ms. Marcotte, who has since quit her job at a clothing store in the Rideau Centre.</p>
<p>In a victim impact statement, Ms. Marcotte, 23, wrote that the attack left her depressed and feeling inadequate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I constantly look over my shoulder. I feel like I&rsquo;m being robbed and beaten every day,&rdquo; said Ms. Marcotte, who suffered nerve damage as a result of the beating.</p>
<p>While Ms. Castle-Trudel agreed that the Crown&rsquo;s argument for jail time was not unreasonable, she asked the court to make an exception for Ms. Omer, who has struggled with a difficult upbringing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With her young child, perhaps she has found her rock, her anchor, to becoming a productive member of society,&rdquo; said Ms. Castle-Trudel. </p>
<p>The community&rsquo;s &ldquo;long-term interest is a productive member of society who will bring up a productive member of society,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Omer is expected to be sentenced on Jan. 6.<br>

		<p>Bringing a baby to court.  </p>
<p>Having worked in several courts throughout my career, this tactic is common among predatory  &#8220;people&#8221;.  Some of them show up with kids with the expectation of sympathy and a break from hard time. &#8220;Look who I got to take care of, ya onah&#8221;! </p>
<p>Notice how this predator just can&rsquo;t be inconvenienced due to having a child, and that her victim should just accept her apology. Rob and beat the hell out of me?  That&rsquo;s okay! These things happen! All&rsquo;s well, now! </p>
<p>If the court accepts this insanity, Canada deserves every social problem that comes its way.</p>
<p>Just a reminder, folks:  Canadians are not allowed to carry handguns or, I believe, even own them.  Think of how this crime scenario would have been if the victims were armed. No more problems with &#8220;swarming&#8221;.    </p>

Not to mention being from a continent with an average IQ of 70, i.e. not far above retarded. </p>
<p>If the Canadians can&rsquo;t get this Somali troublemaker out of their country   &mdash;   and let&rsquo;s face it, they probably can&rsquo;t   &mdash;   they should at least lock her up for a long, long time. </p>

		<p><i>Somali girl gang targeted white Canadian girls &ldquo;because they were rich.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>This is an interesting bit of flim-flammery perpetrated by the left as a matter of doctrine.  They don&rsquo;t want non-whites being charged with &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; against whites, so they (e.g., Tim &#8220;white like you&#8221; Wise) argue that when, say, blacks target whites specifically, they do so not out of racial animus, but because &#8220;whites are rich.&#8221;  Ergo, no &#8220;hate crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously this is nonsense, because believing &#8220;whites are rich&#8221; is as much a racial prejudice as believing &#8220;blacks are dumb.&#8221;  Would it be okay, according to leftists, for a white guy to attack blacks &#8220;because they&rsquo;re dumb&#8221;?</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no no no, dear reader, don&rsquo;t you go believing anything this woman says, she&rsquo;s just a whining crybaby, she probably just made this story up because she doesn&rsquo;t like black people.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Strange how these women targeted a &#8220;white girl&#8221; and yet the words &#8220;hate crime&#8221; were never mentioned? On second thought, its not so strange after all. More like par for the course. </p>

<p>I witnessed an attack similar to this. Three black teens attacked 2 white couples walking to a bar on a weekend night. The robbery seemed secondary to the beating. Like this one. The beating first, then the robbery. They didn&rsquo;t beat the white girls either or steal their purses. While they were beating up the boys the girls got away maybe. Boys don&rsquo;t normally beat up girls I guess. Gangs of black girls will harass or beat up white girls or boys. An ambulance came to the bar and took the boys away. <br>

<p>what? no hate crime charges? oh, i see. they only targeted a white girl because they thought she was rich. well, in that case, you might as well let her go. after all, it was a politically correct crime.</p>

		<p>Somalis are Muslim blacks from a an ultra-violent Stone Age third world hellhole.  Inporting them to Western countries will never civilize them as the crime rates of the blacks who have lived in the West confirms.  </p>
<p>These girls are surrounded by white women who are better looking, more successful and far more intelligent than they are.  This promotes jealosy and jealousy promets self-loathing which leads to hate.  </p>
<p>The fact that these primitives are Muslims adds the universal Muslim hatred of Infidels to the equalion.  The only solution is to drive them out and keep them out&hellip; </p>

<p>Canada:  You are in more trouble than I thought. Your anti-White government believes communities&rsquo; &#8216;long-term&rsquo; interest is to raise &#8216;a productive member of society.&rsquo;  Your government, it seems, has no interest in protecting its citizens from violent Africans that IT chose to import and then foist upon the innocent people of Canada.</p>
<p>A communities&rsquo; long-term goal should be to protect its productive members from vicious, violent predatory criminals such as this Somali  &mdash;  up to and including allowing community members the means to protect themselves by any means possible, deadly force if need be, when faced with violence.</p>
<p>The Somalis are not your greatest enemy (although your country should purge itself of these violent leeches)  &mdash;  your greatest enemy is a government that allows these types of crimes, does not permit you to protect yourself with arms, and then refuses to punish and/or deport  criminal perpetuators when they unleash violence against innocent citizens.</p>
<p>Better yet, the Somalis AND your government officials should be deported forthwith to Africa &mdash; starting with Ms. Castle-Trudel.</p>

		<p>As a Canadian, I seem to encounter Somalis everywhere I go. Unlike most other third-world immigrants, they&rsquo;re not restricting themselves to Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal. And they&rsquo;re far more alien and threatening than any other third-worlders I&rsquo;ve encountered. Also, everywhere I go in the States, I seem to encounter them too. I also know that Somalis have flooded all over Europe, as well as Australia. Question: how many Somalis are left in Africa as opposed to those who live elsewhere? I highly doubt Somalis will return to Somalia, but I bet far more of them will flock to the West.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t any of these victoms have families with men in them? I hate to say this but if anyone were to attack one of my sisters or one of my nieces then they had better hope they can find a nice safe jail to hide in. </p>
<p>If no one else had the guts to take care of it then my poor old gray haired mother would. I have have seen her with a buther knife in one hand and a pistol in the other headed out the door when she even thought someone had attacked one of her kids. What happened to the western world, did we get civilized or just spineless? </p>
<p>The law is useless that why you have to take care of things like this yourself. If the law could protect you then things like this wouldn&rsquo;t happen in the first place. </p>

<p>   My mother (God rest her gentle soul) in the best old South tradition, taught me to respect and be kindly courteous to every woman. However, if attacked by thuggish black amazons, I feel free to use equal deadly force. I&rsquo;ve not heard this Canadian? term &#8220;swarming&#8221; used for mugging before.

		<p>Whatever happened to the Welfare Lady, who comes and takes away your kids when you&rsquo;ve been &#8216;bad&rsquo;?  &#8216;Swarming&rsquo; three innocent victims isn&rsquo;t bad enough?</p>
<p>At our office in Louisiana, our (blonde and Swedish) cleaning lady had her kids taken away (from a very loving and nurturing home), simply because her home did not meet certain &#8216;standards&rsquo;.  Maybe things work differently in Canada&hellip;&hellip;or maybe things work differently when you&rsquo;re black and entitled.</p>
<p>When we were school kids in Mississippi, we were taught that Canadians were just like us, only nicer; and that their country was spotlessly clean.  In &#8216;89, we spent a few days in Montreal, and were amazed at how clean it really was.  The food was so good, we actually tried to find bad food, just to see if there was any, but could not.  I suppose that&rsquo;s all a thing of the past, like going across the border with just a driver&rsquo;s license&hellip;back when North America was populated by people of European extraction, who could be trusted.</p>
<p>As to the &#8216;rich&rsquo; part, I remember seeing a lot of Quebecois in obviously home-made clothes, even homemade overcoats and scarves.  There is plenty of poverty among (real) Canadians, but they compensate for it with industriousness.  The nerve of those Somali women, enjoying the luxury and safety of Canada, at least partially at Canadians&rsquo; expense, and then attacking their benefactors.</p>
<p>For all practical purposes, it&rsquo;s as if superior beings from another planet had taken the Somalis, on a silver spaceship, back to the the beings&rsquo; home planet.  That&rsquo;s how much difference there is between Somalia and Canada.  If I were on someone else&rsquo;s planet, being treated better than I&rsquo;d ever been treated, I sure would not go out among my hosts and start attacking them in their gathering places.  But then, I&rsquo;m not Somali.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does anyone know if Canada has hatecrimes [sic] laws on the books?&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed it does, and their &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; laws in some ways are even worse than ours (hard as that may be to believe).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/hatecrimes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/hatecrimes/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Section 319 deals with publicly stirring up or inciting hatred against an identifiable group based on colour, race, religion, ethnic origin or sexual orientation. It is illegal to communicate hatred in a public place by telephone, broadcast or through other audio or visual means. The same section protects people from being charged with a hate crime if their statements are truthful or the expression of a religious opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right, and the Soviet Constitution guaranteed freedom of religion.  That last sentence from the article is a joke.  Christian ministers who have pointed out (truthfully) the Bible condemns homosexuality as sinful have been fined in Canada.</p>

<p>If you are caught distributing literature pointing out (correctly) the well-documented differences in IQ among the races, you run the real risk of being jailed.</p>
<p>Of course, every Amrener by now I&rsquo;m sure is aware this is only a problem of the government.  The people of Canada are committed to hearing all sides of an argument (said while biting a hole through the side of my face).</p>

		<p>&#8220;The community&rsquo;s &ldquo;long-term interest is a productive member of society who will bring up a productive member of society,&rdquo; she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Productive???? Doesn&rsquo;t she mean first and second generation life long welfare dependents?  The victim was a salesgirl, hardly rich.</p>
<p>Seems like the Canadian Somalis have learned the swarm technique from American blacks.  Hope she stays in Canada.</p>
<p>She and her progeny will be in and out of the courts for the rest of their lives.  And so will her grandchildren and great children.</p>

		<p>So wait, she had a baby AFTER she was arrested for these attacks, knowing full well that she might go to prison?   Why on earth would anyone in that situation would even consider brining a child into the world in those circumstances is completely beyond me.  </p>
<p>And her line about telling the victim that she didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt her - that&rsquo;s gotta be the rudest &#8220;apology&#8221; I have ever heard.  She beat her up.  Of course she meant to hurt her.  Why not just say, &#8221; I meant to hurt you because I am a no-good loser with nothing going for myself.  I took out my frustrations on you because I am a jealous, fickle person of limited intelligence.  I also have no empathy.  I am working on all these things now.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Somalis could only have arrived in Canada as refugees, now that country reaps the reward for its liberal sentimentalism. I believe that Somalis have one of the highest birthrates in the world - if not the highest - so plenty more rewards for our crazy generosity yet to come. I currently work in Oxford,England,&#8221;the city of dreaming spires&#8221; which for some reason has become home (temporary I hope) to many of them - they are rarely seen without an accompanying gaggle of 4,5,6, or 7 children of first school age or below.</p>
<p>There is a possible answer - when Somalia became independent in the 1960s it was put together out of two former colonies, Italian Somalia and the smaller British Somaliland. In the chaos into which Somalia has fallen, the latter colony has declared itself independent as the Republic of Somaliland and has succeeded in maintaining itself reasonably well.No-one has recognized the new republic, but any western country which did so and put in the troops, money and experts to secure the place and prop up its infrastructure, would surely be able to obtain a quid-pro-quo - namely the resettlement there of its entire Somali refugee population. All it needs is will and imagination.   </p>

		<p> If Omer doesn&rsquo;t want jail time, fine. Just give her<br>
nerve damage as well. Do to her what she did to Ms.<br>
Marcotte. This is the only law blacks can ever <br>
respect. They laugh at concepts like fairness and<br>
altruism as a White weakness.</p>
<p> There is a reason Idi Amin and Mobutu Seseseko among<br>
others. Ruled their African countries the way they <br>
did. The black race only respects a law of force, not<br>
fairness.</p>

		<p>The criminal court proceedings represent the PUBLIC remedy for the &#8220;swarming&#8221;.  The last chapter of my manuscript entitled NEW JERSEY CORRUPTION, on file with a copyright registration number in the U.S. Library of Congress, has the quotes from court decisions and other sources, including a lone dissenting opinion from denial of certiorari in which a Justice, I believe Hugo L. Black, wrote that alternatives to resolving disputes in courts of law include negotiation and settlement, insurance, abandonment of recovery, and PRIVATE SELF-HELP.  I would urge people to read the book entitled GETTING EVEN: REVENGE AS A FORM OF JUSTICE. </p>

		<p>Ottawa is having a Somali crime wave.  Hardly a week goes by when the papers don&rsquo;t report a Somali involved in crimes of drugs and violence. </p>
<p>Political correctness prevents anyone from speaking about it.  The only time it is brought up is when the basketball league and police outreach try to claim success at their meager efforts to hold back the tide.</p>

		<p>I hate these false apologies in which the perpetrator claims he &#8220;didn&rsquo;t mean it&#8221;.  Just say you meant it, and THEN express remorse and apologize.  Minimizing your offense with falsehoods is just compounding the wrong.</p>

		<p>Taking back Ottawa<br>
Block Crime &amp; Racism</p>
<p>	As a human being &amp; as a parent, also Canadian Citizen, I can not believe the change in Ottawa&rsquo;s Nations Capital about caring!<br>
(Human nature, respect &amp; freedom.) Rememeber when people would hold doors and say, &#8220;please and thank you,&#8221; or just give up your seat on the bus for anyone? But now Ottawa has a very dark cloud full of shame. Human Compassion is lacking &amp; things need to be fixed and repaired in many areas!<br>
Exspecially what has happened to my Daughter Chanel. She has been a victim in her own space &amp; time. Look at it how you may, but I believe in Human Rights &amp; respact as a Canadian citizin! I respect everything, I believe in being a do gooder! That is how I raised my Daughter Chanel, I am very proud of her &amp; I would be nothing, who I am today, without her. Chanel is pure &amp; even compassionate to everything she see&rsquo;s &amp; applies too. </p>
<p>	Chanel was finishing work in the Rideau Centre, on the second floor, where the company she worked for; as a Visual Technician. She decided to go to the movies that day, but had met her old grade school friend at her company store in the Rideau Centre to buy some time till she met with her other friends. Sarah and Chanel were sitting on a bench outside of Sarah&rsquo;s workplace, when 6-7 dark skin girls started to slandirze, push, pull, assault &amp; rob my daughter very violently, by with intent to beat her. Did not care, while harrassing her Verbally &amp; Physically! Emotionally &amp; Mentally belittling her for no reason., with intent to assault and rob. It is a scar, that Chanel will always have regarding her own Safety &amp; Space in Society.</p>
<p>	Chanel is a very active &amp; cultural person. She had just attended a African wedding and wrote a personnal essay about the wedding. Two weeks prior to her attack. She is not a racist, like the girls who decided to attack her,, the white girl that she is &amp; also a proud Canadian citizen to be. Chanel &amp; Sarah are both mall employee&rsquo;s, how safe do you think it is for a woman in the work place, or commercial driven mall? Or what we call Rideau Centre, should be called City Centre since it is the root of Transportation, Tourism, Shopping &amp; Information to the public. Change is needed. Now the Safety of all patrons is unsuitable regarding RACE,Religion,Age,Sexuallity &amp; Color, you are walking into unsafe shopping Centre.</p>
<p>	Chanel tried to defend herself, as much as she could, all patrons walking by, did not try to help! NO one, can you imagine? Five o&rsquo;clock rush hour, in the middle of a mall, second floor, even 3 major stores, never bothered to help. Chanel said an older gentleman said &#8221; please stop, I don&rsquo;t like it!&#8221; Their are 3 major companies that never helped? Maybe we are all different. First; it was five o&rsquo;clock &amp; it was inside . Second; 6-7 non-white &amp; one white girl. Third; she was a mall employee and no reaction. The lacking of compassion is what&rsquo;s shattering, or is it the norm for today&rsquo;s society, not to help! I am very scared on what&rsquo;s happening in Ottawa, our Nation&rsquo;s Capital. </p>
<p>	We are becoming caught up in our own well being, or choose to look the other way or maybe that there&rsquo;s no compassion left for other&rsquo;s or in fear to help the safety of another human being. Picture it, obviously something is wrong, white girl &amp; group of 6-7 non-white violently attacking, HELLO! No one reacted, is it not our duties to, as Canadian Citizens to help a person in need? Regardless; race or color, culture, sex for Canada is changing &amp; not for the better in regards to RESPECT a persons Rights &amp; Safety. It has caused alot of POISON for Chanel, &amp; as I as the father it is a suffering, that will not seem to go away.</p>
<p>	I also went to 3 company store&rsquo;s the following day after the attack &amp; asked 3 seperate employee&rsquo;s from each store on why they did not help? Response from store 1; did not see, store 2; the girl had said to me,&#8221; she was worried about the girls knocking down their marketing display!&#8221;, (angry) &amp; third store; the man said, &#8221; He was busy with a customer.&#8221; I can not mention how I felt! God bless my daughter &amp; all who are victimizied in the city of Ottawa, Nation&rsquo;s Capital and their parents!</p>
<p>	Things are not going to take over&hellip;. lack of humanity, hate excessiviness, being swarmed, beatin &amp; robbed in the Rideau Centre at 5 o&rsquo;clock rush hour. Also being a mall employee, it took  more than 10 minutes for Security to arrive at the 2nd floor of Rideau Centre, while my daughter is being savagely beatin. I believe Security should have been there sooner. As the girls fled in different directions, Chanel tried to get up to retrieve her purse and cell phone, and ran after the girl&rsquo;s who were saying racial slurs in different languages and she could not understand, but by their looks on their coward faces it was a  racist &amp; meditated for their next moves in action. </p>
<p>	I call this Tuesday, Novemebr 14th; BLACK TUESDAY in more ways than one! I was called at work &amp; could not attend my daughter due to my job at hand, but it was the most difficult phone call. When you hear your daughter is crying &amp; screaming for my HELP, it felt like a suffering of anxiety unbareable. I, have no idea how I maintained my professionnalism in the workplace, but to hear her voice &amp; she&rsquo;s ALIVE AND ENCOUNTERED HELP, made me feel saved. Call police I said, I also said to ask Security to call Oc Transpo Security to catch them at hand and the mall Security told my daughter that Oc Transpo Security are TOOLS! Oc Transpo are excellent help for police. They help police almost every day, security are very fresh out of school &amp; we need bodyguard security or retired police in the Rideau Centre! Being the main CENTRAL root of transportation, alot of things  are going on there and their not mentioned to public, why? Who knows, you figure out. I always visualize Chanel when she told me she was on the floor and the final act of swarming was  3 steps back &amp; they kicked her hard 3 steps forward, my heart hardens with such acts of violence induced on my daughter. </p>
<p>	This emotional &amp; disturbing scar never leaves our minds &amp; its 4 months later on this past Valentines. My daughter has changed, she is nervous to be in ANY mall for her safety! She had to let go of her job, due to the fact of lack response &amp; of compassion from security, mall administration &amp; workplace. The workplace told her to take take time off &amp; not to worry for her pay of 3 days of being in &amp; out of doctor&rsquo;s. She had whiplash &amp; serious foot injury &amp; perhaps surgery. Yet she did not get paid for the days missed&hellip; She went to Administration &amp; asked for her report, they made her feel small and said she needs a lawyer. She was he victim, not the suspect? Security guard questioned her injury, since she had a limp &amp; cane. She went a second time with her boss as a witness &amp; same thing, she left in a state of anxiety &amp; crying for help, where? What resources do victim&rsquo;s have, except Police victim help line, who only called two and half weeks later, after we requested it!</p>
<p>	 We looked every other day at lunch time to spot these girls, very difficult, one day after working after day, no luck. Finally Chanel&rsquo;s friend who was the witness had seen the main girl &amp; called Chanel at her store. Chanel went to look &amp; on the esculator the girl passed by Chanel. She went to get her boss &amp; they looked &amp; spotted her in a store. They called Security &amp; same thing again, are you 100% sure, they asked over and over. Chanel said they were not very helpful, so she called the Detective  &amp; they got one main girl. Still no response &amp; information on what&rsquo;s next, then the Police Dectective went to Chanel&rsquo;s workplace to look at photo&rsquo;s of possible suspects  &amp; told Chanel the main girl was being charged. We requested a restraining order &amp; mall restraining order, the Police said she has one. Three days later, the girl was in the mall again &amp; four days after that, no one cares!</p>
<p>	Security was called again &amp; did not see her. So Chanel had left her place of employment because of lack of protection &amp; the girl&rsquo;s breach of conditions, as a mall employee could not keep on in mall environment! Lack of response from security, scared of being in the workplace &amp; girl disobeying the law is enough to leave. Now what&rsquo;s really a shame is these same girl&rsquo;s left that Novemeber 14th when they finished with Chanel, went to Orleans &amp; robbed, assaulted another girl &amp; two more girl&rsquo;s, WHAT DOES THAT SAY? Meanwhile they still are prowling around the malls. Where are the resources to HELP get these girl&rsquo;s out of the malls &amp; charged &amp; pay for their discriminating actions on going after white young girls? </p>
<p>	Why was Orlean&rsquo;s reported &amp; not Rideau Centre&rsquo;s, 3 assaults &amp; slanderizing &amp; beatings in one day, one night, &amp; they still walking around free for more victim&rsquo;s. While Chanel &amp; other girls are SUFFERING! I pray God to help set some stronger rules &amp; we pray for these girl&rsquo;s to realize RIGHT from WRONG! I wish we had a gouverment office for victim&rsquo;s in our Nation&rsquo;s Capital or a sponser to help people in these cases. I would work for free to help take back Ottawa Nation&rsquo;s Capital Block Crime &amp; Racism. </p>
<p>	I can only hope the Judge takes presidence on this case to make change for the future of our City &amp; victim&rsquo;s needs for help &amp; Chanel my lost daughter, I miss her, she&rsquo;s not the same. I hope time will help, so a healing circle can put closure.</p>
