<h1>Deputies: Gun Drawn Over &lsquo;Go Gators&rsquo; Cheer</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WKMG (Orlando), December 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 51-year-old woman yelling &#8220;Go Gators&#8221; during Florida&rsquo;s victory over Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game had a gun pointed at her by a convicted felon who entered her apartment after he misunderstood the cheering for racial slurs, Orange County sheriff&rsquo;s deputies said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Orange County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, Cooper [Bruce Cooper, 30] entered the woman&rsquo;s home through an unlocked or open door at about 5 p.m. in the Kingswood Apartments, located on Lee Road, and pointed a gun at her.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was later realized that Cooper is a convicted felon on multiple cocaine charges.</p>

		<p>QUICK! Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton need to rush to the aid of Bruce Cooper.  &#8216;Our&rsquo; new president must pass a hate crimes law specifically addressing not just &#8220;Go Gators!&#8221;, but also &#8220;mo taters!&#8221; and the even more insidious  fast-food drive-thru slur, &#8220;no tamaters!&#8221;.  All of these, when heard trough an apartment door could be mistaken for whatever the distinguished Mr. Cooper thought he heard.</p>
<p>If, during the &#8216;Free the Kingswood Apartments One&rsquo; march and peace vigil, anyone ventures into the area wearing a garment emblazoned with an aligator, that person should be charged with a hate crime.  Aligators are a known symbol of black oppression.</p>

<p>Quick, sue the LaCoste shirt company for that racist alligator symbol on every shirt.  Morris Dees has raised a million dollars per day to pursue a law suit against LaCoste since this horrendous racial atrocity occurred. </p>
<p>Teachers everywhere are frantically going through text and library books and snipping out the racist word alligator.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Felon says he thought he heard &ldquo;racial slurs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, and that was when he also heard haunted house music playing inside his head.</p>
<p>Black paranoia festers and grows constantly, and the left wing crazies and the MSM help it along as much as they can, causing millions of whites to be victims of assault and murder.</p>

		<p>There are whites who actually get visits from the police and judgements from the prosecutors office for just this type of thing at apartment complexes across the country. Of course, once the rumor gets started that &#8216;that old lady call joe snuffy the N word&rsquo;, every &#8216;socially conscious individual&rsquo; at the complex will repeat the same allegations too saying it happened to them. Then the victim of harassment, the white person, will often be further victimized by the criminal justice system. To be fair, there are crazy old ladies who actually use the &#8216;n&rsquo; word or similar in public, and aren&rsquo;t just being misheard. In my experience the harassment and name calling usually works the other way around though. Which never seems to become an issue for law enforcement. At least, not in the direction the victim would like it to be.  </p>

		<p>Just another brutha expressing his outrage and gross indignation over some words he thought may have, in his drug-corrupted brain structure, insulted black people.  This is one committed black man &#8220;down wit da struggle&#8221;.   </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a convicted felon, a social bottom feeder with a lengthy rap sheet, and he has nothing to offer anyone but misery, but oh, those &#8220;rasis&#8221; words somebody might have said. </p>

		<p>This story hints at how integration with blacks threatens both the 1st and 2nd Amendments in our Bill of Rights:</p>
<p>We dare not speak disparagingly of our exotic &#8220;African-Americans,&#8221; thus our freedom of speech is compromised; and they are so prone to gun violence that they jeopardize our right to keep and bear arms.</p>
<p>Neither Presidents Thomas Jefferson nor Abraham Lincoln believed that the two races could ever co-exist under the same government, and we seem determined to confirm their doubts with our present futile experiment in inter-racial democracy.</p>

		<p>Somebody clue me in here.  What kind of racial slur could you take from &#8220;Go Gators&#8221;?  Did he think she called him &#8220;gay&#8221; and told the police something different?  If you look at his face it&rsquo;s hard to tell if it&rsquo;s a man or woman.   </p>

		<p>Proactive (see post above) has made one of the best posts I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time. When I did finally stop laughing at the words and phrases in quotes, I had to remind myself that there&rsquo;s much seriousness in that same post. I guess it&rsquo;s good we can still find humor somewhere in this hell of a mess.  We certainly need it.</p>

		<p>I been sending the &#8220;Original articles&#8221; to everyone on my address list for some time now. I avoid sending the AMREN site version simply because the people to whom I send them haven&rsquo;t seen the light yet and the AMREN logo would cause them to doubt the veracity of the article. It has begun to have the desired effect. The article on the Bantu who &#8220;barked&#8221; his way through his arraignment for the shooting at Dunkin Donuts in Broward Co. sparked a torrent of replies from the recipients who expressed their horror that such a thing could take place. Where the Hell have these people been!? I&rsquo;ve bombarded them with the Christian/Newsome atrocity, the Wichita massacre, Lauren Burke, Eve Carson etc. as part of a litany of names of innocent White and Asian victims of Bantu savagery.<br>
I suggest that you all do this if you don&rsquo;t already. My apologies to Mr. Taylor. I love AMREN but in the numbed minds of the Liberals who need educating, they&rsquo;re not yet ready for the White Nationalist point of view. However, given some of the responses I&rsquo;m getting; very few negative, It won&rsquo;t be long until every thinking White person has had his/her full of the atrocious antics of these primitives.</p>

		<p>She was very lucky to escape harm or even death. Blacks are volcanos and the slightest insult (real or imagined) can set them off. She should learn from this and obtain a firearm amd learn how to use it. She should also re-think her &#8216;open or unlocked door&rsquo; policy. Always be on your guard around blacks. </p>

		<p>I must say that I am very disappointed with the comments posted by the normally perceptive AMREN readers concerning this story. Do you really believe this thug entered this woman&rsquo;s apartment to confront her over hearing a possible racial slur?  What was he doing in the apartment building? Does he live there? I doubt it. He probably heard her voice, figured she was alone and would be an easy targetfor rape, robbery and murder.</p>
<p>If you read the original article it states that &#8220;Cooper entered the woman&rsquo;s home through an unlocked or open door at 5pm&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;and pointed a gun at her.&#8221;  Who but someone looking to commit a crime does that?  The article later states &#8220;the woman and others inside the apartment told the man to leave, which he evenutally complied.&#8221;  He was probably shocked to find others in the apartment (probably some males as well) and decided to back off.  I&rsquo;m sure he conjured up the story to explain his behavior to the deputies and mitigate his guilt.</p>
<p>Come on readers.  This was one lucky girl.  If she had been alone in that apartment that night, she would have become just another victim of black on white crime. </p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the police &amp; the DA on this case are are a bit more circumspect of Cooper&rsquo;s ridiculous assertion. &#8220;He misunderstood the cheering for racial slurs.&#8221; What a crock.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, a white police officer in Houston was chasing a black male through an apartment complex this past Sunday. The black male, having a decent headstart, rounded a corner and hid behind a patio fence. When the white police officer rounded the corner, the black male stepped out from behind the fence and shot the officer three times, knocking him down. Then walked over to the fallen officer and shot him point blank in the head, killing him.</p>

<p>Regarding the epidemic of black males raping white females that have recently been mentioned on Amren in other articles, here&rsquo;s one more for you. The written article doesn&rsquo;t mention the race of the perpetrator, but the linked video shows a concealed white female as the victim and the reporter describes the suspect as a black male.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.myfoxhouston.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail;jsessionid=FC91900CA50145564267F6055092D119?contentId=7651347&amp;version=4&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1&amp;sflg=1" rel="nofollow">https://www.myfoxhouston.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail;jsessionid=FC91900CA50145564267F6055092D119?contentId=7651347&version;=4&locale;=EN-US&layoutCode;=TSTY&pageId;=1.1.1&sflg;=1</a></p>
<p>If you watch the video, notice the comment about how the suspect walked up to the female student and struck up a &#8216;friendly&rsquo; conversation. I blame her parents for this for failing to instill a survival mechanism in their daughter to be weary of black males.</p>

		<p>Possession of a firearm by a convicted felon is a federal felony of its own.  Sentencing guidelines would give Cooper five years, aggravated and doubled if he was still on supervision.</p>
<p>Of course, the local federal prosecutor will not pick this case up, and the only reason the local cops arrested Cooper is because he&rsquo;s black.</p>
