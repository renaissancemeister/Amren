<h1><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6155743.html">Weak Economy Could Slow Pace of Immigration Reform</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Carroll and Stewart Powell, Houston Chronicle, December 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President-elect Barack Obama pledged to make comprehensive immigration reform a priority in his first term in the White House, but the nation&rsquo;s worsening economic woes may force delays on the campaign promise, experts said.</p>
<p>Some members of Congress also said the timetable for reform may have to await a better economy and a more receptive political climate to providing legal status to illegal immigrants in the U.S. Other Congressional leaders urged quick action on immigration reform, which has stalled in recent years amid fierce opposition.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With growing unemployment, some advocates worried that illegal immigrants would be &#8220;scapegoated&#8221; for working without authorization. Unemployment jumped to 6.7 percent in November.</p>
<p>The election of Obama and his selection of Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano &mdash; a moderate on immigration issues &mdash; to head the Department of Homeland Security had raised hopes of immigrant advocates that the new administration would submit early legislation to create a pathway for legal status for some of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.</p>
<p>Obama had promised on the campaign trail to make immigration reform, including a legalization program, a &#8220;top priority&#8221; in his first term.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a president who isn&rsquo;t going to walk away from something as important as comprehensive immigration reform when it becomes politically unpopular,&#8221; Obama told the League of United Latin American Citizens in July.</p>
<p>But Reid Cherlin, a spokesman for Obama&rsquo;s transition team, said officials with the incoming administration were not available to discuss prospects for immigration reform.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s transition team has merely named a two-person working group to begin reviewing options.</p>
<p>Georgetown law school dean T. Alexander Aleinikoff previously served as a top official in the Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Clinton administration. Stanford law school professor Mariano-Florentino Cuellar previously served as a senior adviser to top Clinton administration officials on enforcement-related issues and has worked on recent projects examining the role of criminal enforcement in immigration policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Advocates of stricter border control are pledging to fight efforts to provide legal status to undocumented immigrants, an approach they describe as amnesty. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said immigrant advocates have overestimated the odds of passing a legalization program in Congress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy organization also based in Washington, said he expects an Obama administration to move for comprehensive immigration reform by next Thanksgiving, calling it &#8220;part and parcel of economic reform.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Half of the illegal aliens in the USA work in construction. Much of the other half work in the hospitality industry. When the housing bubble burst last summer, we had the illegal invaders right where we wanted them. </p>
<p>Now Mr. Obama wants to save their collective hinnie&rsquo;s with a massive &#8220;infrastructre stimulus&#8221; program, expected to be about $500 billion. Anyone want to guess who will get many of the jobs working on the highways, bridges, etc etc?  Yes, you are right&hellip;.all the unemployed illegal aliens who used to work construction. Without this massive program, millions and millions of illegal aliens will VOLUNTARILY self-deport themselves back to Mexico and Latin America.</p>
<p>This recession is the best thing that has happened in decades. This is the first chance we have had to push the invader back across the border, without having to chase them down&hellip;one at a time. The worse it gets, the better for the country.<br/>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t kid youselves.  Reid has already started on immigration &#8220;reform.&#8221;  The idea is to register the now illegals as Democrates by 2010.</p>

		<p>A weak economy, a disaster of some sort, a government coup, etc. Sure, these are about the only things that will stop our traitorous, utterly corrupt politicians from giving amnesty to illegal alien foreign nationals. They sure won&rsquo;t stop illegal immigration on behalf of the citizenry. In fact, the citizenry is the last thing, the very last thing that is ever on the minds of these traitors. We see it day in and day out.</p>

<p>Doom and gloom advocates, contrary to what the PC crowd want people to believe, are not that numerous.  In fact, for every expert that predicts dire consequences for our economy, there&rsquo;s at least 50 who paint a happy face on everything no matter how dismal things appear, and it is usually they, who have something to gain for themselves by offering false information, who cause millions to lose tremedous amounts from their 401K&rsquo;s and other investment portfolios.</p>
<p>Instead of taking what anything any of the &#8220;experts&#8221; say at face value, I try to find out if the person who is forecasting has anything to gain by giving the opinion he/she does.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like the usually unbiased &#8220;trend&#8221; forcasters, because they make their money on being correct.  They contract with businesses to evaluate the information of a particular business and project what would be in their best interests to do in the short and long term.</p>
<p>If one of these people project that oil is going up the following year and that commodities would be a good investment and oil and other commodities sink to low levels they can forget about doing business with many firms.  They don&rsquo;t have to be 100% accurate, of course, but they DO have to be MOSTLY accurate, especially in making forecasts that involve great changes in the economic picture.  Bad forecasts made in public will result in a failed trends company.</p>
<p>One such forecaster who has an uncanny ability to get things right is Gerald Celente, Trends Research.  For my money he&rsquo;s the absolute best in the business.</p>
<p>He forecast the dot com rise and crash, the 2008 sub-prime collapse, plus much else, which is explained right here: </p>

<a href="http://trendsresearch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://trendsresearch.com/</a></p>
<p>And other trend forecasters, listed below, contribute their forecasts.  Enter their names in Google to get their business analysis, if you want further info.  None of them, however, can hold a candle to Gerald Celente.</p>
<p>Nouriel Roubini<br/>
Marc Faber<br/>
Nassim Nicholas Taleb<br/>
Antal E. Fekete and Darryl Schoon</p>
<p>&#8220;Other Congressional leaders urged quick action on immigration reform, which has stalled in recent years amid fierce opposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>After watching and reading what the above have to say, especially, Celente, does anyone still believe that if this immigration bill is passed it will not be an economic calamity, added to what is already a calamitous situation, making the whole affair something akin to total collapse?</p>
<p>Thankfully, I invested in gold when it was much lower than today, and I&rsquo;m preparing for the worst but hoping for the best.</p>
<p>This PC crowd that has control of Washington now are even more dense and gullible than Bush and his neo-cons, and every single one of them is out-of-touch with the real world.  As Gerald Celente points out, in essence, there&rsquo;s the world of the elites, and there&rsquo;s the real world, and only those of us in the real world really know what is going on.  The people on the street are head and shoulders above Washington, academia, and the MSM.</p>

		<p>If this turns out to be the case, the only thing that will have saved us from the idiocy of the Bush administration was our good fortune at having a timely recession.  Wow.  Now that is going to be an interesting chapter in the history books.  It says reams about the foolishness of our political class.</p>

<p>There was really nothing &#8220;timely&#8221; about it. We had the recession <i>because of</i> mass immigration - expecially of the low-skilled kind. You simply cannot continue to improve quality of living and have mass immigration by tens of millions of largely unskilled workers. It can&rsquo;t happen. Eventaully, as with now, the bill comes due. Until we realize this we will see our quality of life dwindle away, probably in the form of the boom/bust cycle of late, with each successive boom unable to return us to the levl we were at before the prior bust.</p>
