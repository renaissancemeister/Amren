			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Name the location in Wyoming where 40 percent of the population was born in Ethiopia, South Korea or Vietnam, and where there has been a recent influx of HIV-positive children, adopted from Africa.</p>
<p>Oh, and 60 percent of its residents can be described as nonwhite Mormons.</p>
<p>The answer?</p>
<p>The Henderson household, on Happy Valley Lane.</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend of mine said we&rsquo;re single-handedly trying to diversify Star Valley,&#8221; Josh Henderson said with a laugh.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Star Valley is near the Idaho border, settled in the 1870s by Mormon pioneers, and it has remained relatively isolated since. It is perhaps one of the last places one might expect to find a family like the 13-member Hendersons &mdash; a veritable Rainbow Coalition inhabiting a six-bedroom home, including a 3-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl, both born HIV-positive in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The valley remains an almost all-white community, historically home to dairy farms and other agricultural endeavors, surrounded by three national forests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a trans-racial family in Star Valley, we had to worry about dealing with race issues,&#8221; Josh said.</p>
<p>And when HIV-positive children were added to the picture, the Hendersons really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect.</p>
<p>But all told, the community response has been generally supportive so far, they said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Josh and Erin are white, and they have three biological children, all boys.</p>
<p>The rest of their 11 children were adopted between 2002 and 2008 &mdash; one from Vietnam, one from South Korea, three from the United States and three from Ethiopia. None is white.</p>
<p>The most recent of the adoptions, Belane and Solomon, now 5 and 3, were born HIV-positive in Ethiopia. Nationwide, they&rsquo;re two of fewer than 100 HIV-positive children adopted from overseas and brought to the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Star Valley, like most of the West, is changing. The Hendersons, perhaps, are both symptoms and agents of that change.</p>
<p>The Hendersons believe just as the valley has changed, prevailing ideas about such things as race, and HIV, can change here, too.</p>

		<p>Why is it that only whites suffer from the sickness where they feel the need to raise children of other races - just because they are of other races?  This is not a case of &#8220;inclusiveness&#8221; nor is it a case of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  It is a case of hatred plain and simple toward their own race.  If they love Ethiopian children so much, let them move to Ethiopia.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s so many things wrong with this on so many levels.  What if one of those HIV darlings bit one of their sons and infected him or a neighborhood child?  I wouldn&rsquo;t let any of my children play with these kids.  Why choose 99% White Star Valley to bring up this third world managerie instead of some place more diverse?<br/>
Shouldn&rsquo;t these kids be able to identify with people like them?  I also don&rsquo;t think the local hospital will be able to adequately provide for their medical problems. How many houses have gone up for sale on Happy Valley Ln since they moved in?  Sometimes I wonder if there&rsquo;s more going on here than just some family&rsquo;s liberal ideology at work.  Are the liberal elites trying to destroy the last bastions of conservatism by paying families to adopt colored kids and moving them into these areas?  Is the family hoping for an &#8220;incident&#8221; so they can cash in on a lawsuit?  Is their subdivision sitting on a goldmine?  These are the kind of questions I ask myself trying to find some logical reason for this behavior.  </p>

		<p>If you want to do a psycological study or assesment, the three natural children would be a good place to start. &#8220;How do you feel sharing your family and household with strangers from all over the world?!?&#8221; &#8220;Do you ever feel that you weren`t good enough because your real mom and dad had to add children not their own to find happiness?!?&#8221; Do you feel like the life you deserve has been squandered on 11 more children giving you less of your parents time and attention?!?&#8221; I`m guessing here that the real kids will have an AMRen point of view about their parents soiling the nest to make themselves feel better about themselves. If I was one of those kids I would be seething with rage at my parents. And planning my escape through drugs or alcohol from their stupid rainbow world&hellip; </p>

<p>These poor, sick people are in desperate need of a rude awakening.  A kind of shock treatment.</p>

		<p>It really is amazing how gullible and delusionary many Euro-Americans are about race; actually suicidally provacative in the case of this sick, weird pair. Talk about asking for trouble, these misfits are true gluttons for self punishment! This kind of racial treason and madness is everywhere to be seen anymore; thanks to liberals, renegades and religious wackos. The equality ethos and propaganda of decades has worked its destructive evil. White America is going down hard and fast!</p>

		<p>I feel bad for all of the children involved, especially their own biological kids who are missing out on the full attention of their own parents, which nature never intended to happen. </p>
<p>The Hendersons would have made a better decision by opting to never have biological children, starting a non-profit organization, and moving to Ethiopia to care for the needy around the clock until they expire.</p>

		<p>As a white child who was given up for adoption by my birth parents and adopted and raised by my adoptive parents, I must say, why are they going halfway across the world to adopt children of nonwhite pedigree when there are plenty of white children who seek adoption, or get aborted before they are even born.  This is a mix of misplaced compassion coupled with trying to be trendy, like Angelina Jolie.</p>

There are plenty of white kids out there needing a home. What would possess a white couple to ignore these needy white kids and search the world for hiv positive non white kids to adopt? </p>

		<p>Can anyone cite a single example about people from other races adopting children, much less, adopting children interracially?</p>
<p>Altruism is perhaps one of our strongest traits as White people and once allowed us to thrive in the world and build our great culture and civilization. However, mixed in a climate of multiculturalism, it is also the deadliest trait to our very existence. Other races and cultures prey on us. Very disturbing.</p>

		<p>I was raised Mormon, though I haven&rsquo;t been practicing in over 20 years. There is a Mormon &#8220;prophecy&#8221; that one day &#8216;the Constitution will be hanging by a thread, and a Mormon white knight will ride in to save it.&rsquo; But when I look around at Mormon politicians (Mitt Romney excepted) all I see are idiots who believe some of the dumbest things. All are pro-amnesty. Utah gives illegals more benefits than any other state, and Utah voters actually rejected school choice at the polls.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s sad that it&rsquo;s easier to adopt abroad than in your own state. (I have always thought that I&rsquo;d like to adopt a white child. I&rsquo;ve been told that there&rsquo;s nothing like having your own. But it&rsquo;s about a child needing a parent/s-a child needing to be loved and my wanting to love a child, not my needing to be pregnant. I&rsquo;ve never felt that I needed pregnancy to live a fulfilled life.) </p>
<p>Why bring 2 or 100 HIV children to this country when the whole country can&rsquo;t be brought? (Oh, that&rsquo;s a comin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m afraid.) What&rsquo;s the point?</p>

		<p>I wonder if this could be an example of where multi-culturalism could work ?</p>
<p>I think that the family unit might overcome racial differences and maintain order and cohesion abd create emotional bonds. The heads of the family (dad and mom ) could make sure the children conformed to the family unit allowing it&rsquo;s formation . </p>
<p>The problem is..<br/>
This is the machevellian purpose for multi-culturalism being forced on society, so that that the government (parent)<br/>
to force it&rsquo;s citizens (children) to conform to it&rsquo;s absolute authority . <br/>
That does not sound like an American ideal.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t get. </p>
<p>If exploring other cultures is important to you, there are several student exchange programs still active.  However, these kids, growing up here, will be culturally American, which means that race will be the only difference between them &amp; their step-siblings.  So, if you think that race isn&rsquo;t important, here&rsquo;s a situation where race is being MADE important, artifically, but without the cultural enrichment aspect that actually interests people.</p>
<p>Am I the only person who thinks it&rsquo;s nuts?  </p>

Forgive me for disagreeing with you just slightly.  I don&rsquo;t believe this is a case of self-hatred   &mdash;    not in the case of wacky religious cults anyway.   In some  other cases, maybe &hellip;   but not here.   </p>
<p>I believe this is more of a case of showing off.  Showing off one&rsquo;s virtue.  Bragging of being more holy than thou.   <i>&#8220;Look at me!  See how  &#8216;good&rsquo; and virtuous I am?&#8221;  </i>  Of course, it all depends on their notion of what is &#8220;good&#8221;;  and that notion has been instilled by popular fads in religion and the cuilture &hellip; all of it being largely determined  by the media.  A hundred years ago it was not the fashion. They would have been thought just crazy.  A hundred years from now, it&rsquo;ll be some other fad that trendy fools like them will fall for.  Who knows what?   But whacked-out crazies like this don&rsquo;t live alone.  They are a danger to the community around them.  Sorry, I&rsquo;m just telling it like it is!</p>

It&rsquo;s been MADE fashionable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s big competition among the trendy set to see who can show more &#8220;compassion&#8221; to the suffering, &#8220;oppressed&#8221; non-whites of the world. White children are not fashionable.  And, of course, we have to compensate for the wickedness and insensitivity of our  white ancestors, don&rsquo;t we?</p>

<p>&#8220;School choice&#8221; (read: vouchers) are not a conservative position as much as they are neo-conservative, lamestream conservative skullduggery.  Real conservatives oppose vouchers for two reasons:  (1)  They would mean undue government influence over private schools (Catholic Schools that participate in proto-voucher programs in St. Louis have to cover up crosses while they are teaching voucher students), and (2) Vouchers would mean more blacks and Hispanics in otherwise white private schools.</p>
<p>When put to a vote, vouchers fail consistently across the board, from the very conservative to very liberal jurisdictions.  About the only places where there are enough political legs to get them implemented are black cities, based on the delusions of black parents the schools are somehow bad, not the IQ of their children.</p>

		<p><i>Can anyone cite a single example about people from other races adopting children, much less, adopting children interracially?</i></p>
<p>Notice that one of the children adopted was South Korean.  South Korea has one of the highest per capita GDPs in the world and an extremely low birth rate, but Americans are still adopting Korean children.  Why?  It&rsquo;s because Korean families <i>won&rsquo;t even adopt other Koreans.</i>  This is a typical mindset for most non-white countries, where even same-race, out-of-family adoption is virtually unknown and is often considered shameful.</p>
<p>International, interracial adoption is a purely white (and more specifically Northern European white) phenomenon, occurring wherever Northern European whites are found.  It so happens that the all-Nordic Faroe islands have the highest rate of international adoptions in the world:</p>

		<p>This is the result of fifty years or so of mainstream media brainwashing individual whites and demonising white nation-states at the same time. Take a look at the 18 year-old leftist/anarchist students rioting in Greece, one of their gripes is &#8216;globalism&rsquo; despite the fact that the socialist liberal/left worldwide encourages mass immigration (into white majority-countries only though), which of course is a result of globalism. Don&rsquo;t look for logic when looking at MSM-brainwashed stooges. It just doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Here in the UK we have a bunch of seven so-called animal rights terrorists awaiting sentencing after being found guilty of a campaign of terror against people with even the remotest connection with a lab which carries out animal testing for animal research, which included falsely spreading lies throughout communities by branding men with families as paedophiles, digging up the grave and defiling the body of an 80 year-old relative of someone alleged to do work for a lab and many other vile deeds which can only be described as the acts of depraved minds. Liberalism/Cultural Marxism is a sickness which has been allowed to spread its poison into every nook and cranny of our lives until it has reached the stage where it has blurred the difference between right and wrong especially amongst naive and gullible young minds. Previous animal rights terrorists have been treated leniently by the liberal justice system. Let&rsquo;s now see if our establishment elite will punish these sick depraved people who made life hell for lots of innocent people.</p>
<p>I believe this sick brainwashed couple above are another example of the &#8216;I can do more good for the world than you can&rsquo; syndrome. Pity they don&rsquo;t go and live in such a third-world hellhole instead of importing it to the USA and expecting other taxpayers to foot the medical bills.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Much like the Pitt-Jolie team of collectors of rare and unusual human children. These people see a way to have their 15 minutes of fame.&#8221;<br/>

Wasn&rsquo;t this fad for human menageries  started by &hellip; what was her name &hellip; Mia Foster?  No, Mia Farrow!   Ah yes, whatever became of her?  After Woody Allen was found to be seducing  one (or more) of their daughters, we don&rsquo;t hear anything more.</p>
<p>But no!  It wasn&rsquo;t even her.  It goes back further to Dale Evans and Roy Rogers. They even started a ranch to contain their human collection!  </p>
<p>And how many children of their own did this famous married couple produce?  As far as I know &hellip;  NONE!</p>
<p>Is it any wonder we&rsquo;re going extinct, when unfulfilled, busy-body wackos like these, with nothing better to do with their lives,  are held up before us as public idols?</p>

		<p><i>International, interracial adoption is a purely white (and more specifically Northern European white) phenomenon, occurring wherever Northern European whites are found. <br/>
 <br/>
It so happens that the all-Nordic Faroe islands have the highest rate of international adoptions in the world. </i></p>
<p><br/>
That is extremely interesting. <br/>
And I&rsquo;d be extremely interested to know if these people have simply fallen for this, entirely on their own, as a result of their own natural folly?  Or have they been PUSHED into accepting this self-defeating behavior by some other interested parties?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why is it that only whites suffer from the sickness where they feel the need to raise children of other races - just because they are of other races?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with having compassion but it&rsquo;s taken to the extreme to the point where it is detrimental to our race.  I am a White flighter who moved to small town America to escape the ever encroaching tentacles of diversity as did alot of people in the area.  There may be 100 blacks living in the county mostly working for the Federal government or the nearby prison.  Even here, I still see the occasional race mixer or couple with adopted third world children. In regards to race relations, I see the most disturbing things whenever an infrequent black is spotted in town.  Whenever one walks from the grocery store to their car, people will come right up to them off the street not even knowing them and start a conversation with them.  A few months ago I was at a concession stand and there was this black child in line in front of me.  She left the line and came back 5 minutes later and the woman at the register said she was next and let her come up to the front and make a purchase.  I was getting gas just today when what I can only describe as a blackmobile pulled up and an obese black man got out and went inside.  I followed to pay for my gas and the guy was inside asking for directions.  The attendant was taking his time explaining to him how to get to his destination.  The black guy leaves and the attendant leaves his station and runs outside to give him additional information.  It was an absolutely sickening display and none of these incidents would have happened if the people involved were White.      </p>
