<h1>More Than 700,000 Immigrants to US Detained, 386 Die in One Year</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, December 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 700,000 foreigners were detained after entering the US illegally, and 386 died in attempts to do so during the 2008 fiscal year, US Border Patrol said here Wednesday.</p>
<p>Most &mdash; 661,766 &mdash; were Mexicans, many who had crossed their country&rsquo;s 2,000-mile (3170-kilometer) land border with the southern United States, according to Border Patrol&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs.</p>
<p>The rest &mdash; 62,059 &mdash; were citizens of other countries, a majority from Central America, including almost 20,000 from Honduras, more than 16,300 from Guatemala and just over 12,000 from El Salvador.</p>
<p>A total of 386 died, down from 398 the previous US fiscal year, which runs from October 1 to September 30.</p>
<p>Hispanic leaders have urged president-elect Barack Obama to issue a moratorium on immigration raids and deportations after the US Congress failed to pass the most recent version of sweeping immigration legislation in 2007.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation would have given legal status to the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants residing in the United States.<br>

		<p>Perhaps the reason why there are 386 deaths of illegal aliens in FY 2008 is because the climate of the border region is hot desert.</p>
<p>If any institution is to blame it&rsquo;s the Mexican government, for:  (1) Their quasi-official policy of encouraging northward &#8220;migration,&#8221; and (2) sending its own illegal aliens (mostly from countries south of Mexico) to their northern border.</p>

		<p>Thow shall not covet thy neighbor.  Mexicans and other illegals come here to take/steal.   Most buy into the idea US is obligated to help them.  If people enter US illegally then they need to accept the consequences.  Deportation.  Instead, the failed policies of Feds, States have resulted in US being held captive to policing, documenting, nourishing, housing, holding courts/costs,tanslations, even reproduction of girls/women and their keep, etc.  Can anyone see the unsustainable costs of not keeping US deportation laws?   It is much eaiser to stop the problem at its entry.   V</p>

		<p>What is amazing to me is that many liberals in their social engineering blithely believe that Mexicans somehow will get along with their Mestizo brethren, the Guatemalan and Ecuadorans.  How can they, when they kill each other, sur a la bordero?</p>

		<p>12 million? I&rsquo;ve been hearing this &#8220;12 million&#8221; number since the early 90s. It&rsquo;s closer to 40 million. I&rsquo;m also tired of hearing people, sometimes even so-called &#8220;conservatives&#8221; say that we can&rsquo;t deport them. You want a &#8220;jobs&#8221; program, Obama? Something to &#8220;stimulate&#8221; the economy? Then start buying buses from GM and hire some unemployed Americans to drive the buses. Start loading the buses with these illegal aliens and tell the drivers to head due south.</p>

		<p>Good for you (posted at 5:02AM)! I&rsquo;ve said for years that the number of illegal aliens was over 12 million when Bush took office. And we know he&rsquo;s been the best friend Mexico has ever had. You are much closer to the true number than this static 12M that newspapers and politicians quote. And the strange thing about illegals and Bush is that they don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s done enough for them. There are looking forward to Obama&rsquo;s reign - and rightly so. He will finish what Bush left undone. The schools in Mexico teach that the US must take care of the citizens of Mexico from birth to death, and the idiots in Washington have done nothing to rufute that sense of entitlement.</p>

		<p>I agree with June and 5:02 am (and most everyone else who posts here!)  The number of illegals in the US HAS to be at least 20 to 25 million.  I think people will be shocked by the 2010 census if there is an approximation made of the number of illegals, assuming the government releases accurate figures.  </p>

		<p>This and every future Holiday season let us not forget that the director (and his son) of the classic movie &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221; was killed in a head on collision by an unlicensed drunken Mexican illegal.  </p>
<p>He was one of the nearly five thousand Americans killed every year on our highways by unlicensed drunken Mexican illegals.    </p>
