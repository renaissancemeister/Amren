			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Henry, Telegraph (London), December 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Westminster Abbey may be one of Britain&rsquo;s most famous landmarks, but the word abbey has been removed from the Oxford Junior Dictionary.</p>
<p>Oxford University Press has removed words like &#8220;aisle&#8221;, &#8220;bishop&#8221;, &#8220;chapel&#8221;, &#8220;empire&#8221; and &#8220;monarch&#8221; from its Junior Dictionary and replaced them with words like &#8220;blog&#8221;, &#8220;broadband&#8221; and &#8220;celebrity&#8221;. Dozens of words related to the countryside have also been culled.</p>
<p>The publisher claims the changes have been made to reflect the fact that Britain is a modern, multicultural, multifaith society.</p>
<p>But academics and head teachers said that the changes to the 10,000 word Junior Dictionary could mean that children lose touch with Britain&rsquo;s heritage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a certain Christian narrative which has given meaning to us over the last 2,000 years. To say it is all relative and replaceable is questionable,&#8221; said Professor Alan Smithers, the director of the centre for education and employment at Buckingham University. &#8220;The word selections are a very interesting reflection of the way childhood is going, moving away from our spiritual background and the natural world and towards the world that information technology creates for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>An analysis of the word choices made by the dictionary lexicographers has revealed that entries from &#8220;abbey&#8221; to &#8220;willow&#8221; have been axed. Instead, words such as &#8220;MP3 player&#8221;, &#8220;voicemail&#8221; and &#8220;attachment&#8221; have taken their place.</p>
<p>Lisa Saunders, a worried mother who has painstakingly compared entries from the junior dictionaries, aimed at children aged seven or over, dating from 1978, 1995, 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2007, said she was &#8220;horrified&#8221; by the vast number of words that have been removed, most since 2003.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Christian faith still has a strong following,&#8221; she said. &#8220;To eradicate so many words associated with the Christianity will have a big effect on the numerous primary schools who use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Saunders realised words were being removed when she was helping her son with his homework and discovered that &#8220;moss&#8221; and &#8220;fern&#8221;, which were in editions up until 2003, were no longer listed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I decide to take a closer look and compare the new version to the other editions,&#8221; said the mother of four from Co Down, Northern Ireland. &#8220;I was completely horrified by the vast number of words which have been removed. We know that language moves on and we can&rsquo;t be fuddy-duddy about it but you don&rsquo;t cull hundreds of important words in order to get in a different set of ICT words.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony Seldon, the master of Wellington College, a leading private school in Berkshire, said: &#8220;I am stunned that words like &#8220;saint&#8221;, &#8220;buttercup&#8221;, &#8220;heather&#8221; and &#8220;sycamore&#8221; have all gone and I grieve it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think as well as being descriptive, the Oxford Junior Dictionary, has to be prescriptive too, suggesting not just words that are used but words that should be used. It has a duty to keep these words within usage, not merely pander to an audience. We are looking at the loss of words of great beauty. I would rather have &#8220;marzipan&#8221; and &#8220;mistletoe&#8221; then &#8220;MP3 player.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oxford University Press, which produces the junior edition, selects words with the aid of the Children&rsquo;s Corpus, a list of about 50 million words made up of general language, words from children&rsquo;s books and terms related to the school curriculum. Lexicographers consider word frequency when making additions and deletions.</p>
<p>Vineeta Gupta, the head of children&rsquo;s dictionaries at Oxford University Press, said: &#8220;We are limited by how big the dictionary can be &mdash; little hands must be able to handle it &mdash; but we produce 17 children&rsquo;s dictionaries with different selections and numbers of words.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look back at older versions of dictionaries, there were lots of examples of flowers for instance. That was because many children lived in semi-rural environments and saw the seasons. Nowadays, the environment has changed. We are also much more multicultural. People don&rsquo;t go to Church as often as before. Our understanding of religion is within multiculturalism, which is why some words such as &#8220;Pentecost&#8221; or &#8220;Whitsun&#8221; would have been in 20 years ago but not now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said children&rsquo;s dictionaries were trialed in schools and advice taken from teachers. Many words are added to reflect the age-related school curriculum.</p>

&#8220;IngSoc&#8221;   &mdash;   the simplistic, ideologically-driven, deliberately-stupid &#8220;language&#8221; necessary for Newspeak in Orwell&rsquo;s &#8220;1984&#8221;   &mdash;   has arrived. And the &#8220;dumbening&#8221; of society proceeds apace. </p>
<p>Is &#8220;dumbening&#8221; in this children&rsquo;s dictionary yet? Or will we have to wait for the next edition for that?</p>

		<p>This is part of a conscious policy of globalization by the G8 elites that to them necessarily entails not simply multiracialism but a process of, if you will, de-civilization of and de-acculturating native Western peoples, rather than attempting to assimilate and acculturate all the Third World peoples the West is attempting to absorb.  The late Samuel Francis held that Western Civilization could not continue without the Western peoples that had created it.  The decivilization and de-acculturation efforts illustrated in this article are a silent tribute to his insight.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with the deletion of the animals &hellip; at least most of them.  I&rsquo;m a grownup and even I don&rsquo;t know what some of those animals are, and have never had reason to.  The last paragraph, which seems to be mostly plants, could maybe be thinned out a bit.  Adding the computer terms is probably not a bad idea.  I have to disagree with deletion of the Christian terms, but I think we all know why they were axed.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. Even if you go along with their supposed &#8220;multiCULTural&#8221; ideal, what&rsquo;s the meaning of removing all those plant, animal, and nature words? Do these things cease to exist just because we live in a &#8220;diverse&#8221; environemtnt? (God, let&rsquo;s hope they don&rsquo;t remove the word &#8220;air&#8221; anytime soon).</p>
<p>Also, removing the word &#8220;aisle&#8221; from the dictionary, even though that can double as referring to an aisle in the grocery store.</p>
<p>Another note - this snip of the article doesn&rsquo;t tell you this, but this &#8220;editor&#8221; in charge of the English dictionaries is an INDIAN IMMIGRANT!</p>
<p>I see the lessons from 1984 have not been learned in masse. If they had, more people would realize the extreme danger of putting control over your languages&rsquo;s words in the hands of a stranger.</p>
<p>Someone stop this planet and the idiots who live on it - I want off!</p>

<p>I just assummed that Islam had a part in this. I immediately thought of &#8220;The Black Stallion&#8221;, the story of a young kid who loves, tames, and rides an untamed Arabian horse. Man, I loved that movie as a kid. I got so excited watching Alec ride <br>

		<p>Any sensible adult would have his kids use an adult dictionary anyway.  Who wants a dictionary that doesn&rsquo;t even have &#8220;almond&#8221; or &#8220;stork&#8221; in it?  A dictionary that makes such arbitrary omissions of words is going to be useless, all issues of political correctness aside.</p>

		<p>It is strange that so many words were axed compared to those which were added. </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with incorporating a few new words with each edition of a dictionary, to help keep it more up-to-date - yet this was a major overhaul.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it also a bit odd that such a large number of the dropped words had to do with the Christian faith? Hummm&hellip;</p>

		<p>As a parent, and as a cleric, I find this to be frighteningly complicit with the studied antichristian bias and bigotry that suffuses the modern multicultural mindset.</p>
<p>I use a dictionary with my children everyday (I homeschool them). Clearly, the words they already know, the do not NEED definitions for- my son can tell you what an MP3 player is, how it works, etc. But he DOESN&rsquo;T know what the words (for instance) describing things in our own sanctuary are, or why the Vicar is not the same thing as a priest, etc. for they have not been taught him&hellip;yet! Therein lies the difference between what a child&rsquo;s vocabulary is, and what it SHOULD BE. And a dictionary should help in that LEARNING PROCESS, not join in the chorus of &#8216;know-nothings&rsquo; that continually &#8216;dumb us down&rsquo; to the level of the lowest&hellip;and we know who they are.</p>
<p>The modern world doesn&rsquo;t give a damn (yes, DAMN!) about Christ Christianity, Christendom, or Christmas (this time of year especially) but it should, and will, either consciously by studying the White Man&rsquo;s past, or they will be forced to bend the knee, at the Parousia. Either way, you cannot ignore we &#8216;happy few.&rsquo; Ours is a culture of Victory, and legislating vocabulary out of existence just because it&rsquo;s not PC, &#8216;don&rsquo;t make it right,&rsquo; as Wm. S. Gilbert used to say. (Don&rsquo;t know who he is? LOOK IT UP!)</p>

		<p>It is certainly a tragedy of mammoth proportions when someone named Vineeta Gupta holds the position as head of children&rsquo;s dictionaries at Oxford University Press, and makes ukases regarding what language and vocabulary is desirable for what she calls British children.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, only rather dull children have recourse to children&rsquo;s dictionaries in any case. The children likely to want to know what an abbey or franklin or chancel or priory is are likely to have access to other resources, and more than likely to circumvent children&rsquo;s dictionaries altogether.</p>
<p>Children who are able to read Brian Jacques or Tolkein or even JK Rowling&rsquo;s Harry Potter series will look to other references to learn the meanings of catkin, cowslip or crocus. The disadvantaged raised in the slums or even in the rural commons have never had access to dictionaries or the wherewithal to use them. </p>
<p>So Vineeta Gupta hasn&rsquo;t struck such a vital blow at English culture as she may like to think she has. Still, it would be interesting to know if she has insidiously inserted words like imam, mosque, minaret, ashram, madrassah, Brahmin, Ksatriya, karma or any others she deems more fitting for a society rushing into self-destruction, graced by diversity.  </p>

		<p>Back in 1982, I was praising Prime Minister Thatcher&rsquo;s quick response to the Argentine invasion of the Falklands with the old, familiar quote &#8220;There&rsquo;ll always be an England.&#8221;  That was 1982.  In 2008, I doubt that we can be so certain. England seems to be on the cultural suicide route at an accelerated pace. If I knew the remedy for this sickness, I&rsquo;d make haste to England with it.  It&rsquo;s a land worth saving - its history and its people. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see much rhyme or reason for the removal of the names of animals and plants from the dictionary unless it is to speed up the dumbing-down of the world, as pointed out in an earlier post.  It&rsquo;s quite clear what&rsquo;s going on with the words that are mostly associated with Christianity.  Countries make laws that are very severe against those who would commit blasphemy against Islam, but even some years ago no one said a word when some &#8220;great artist&#8221; placed a Crucifix in a jar of his own urine and photographed it.  Left-wingers praised it as great art with multiple interpretations. Will the day come when it&rsquo;s a crime to own a Bible? </p>
<p> Oh well, I won&rsquo;t ramble on as is often my tendency. I side with those Amreners who wonder when white people will get the guts to stand up for themselves and their religion again.  We might want to take a look at the boys who fought for us in WWI and WWII to see how they thought about sticking together.  Better yet, hop in your time machine, and travel back to 1861 and ask the Confederate soldiers what held them together as an effective fighting machine.  Ask them about their interpretation of &#8220;duty, honor, country.&#8221;    </p>

		<p>Long before this, even in America, I&rsquo;ve noticed that certain dictionaries have a political bias. But this is absurd. If these words are useless, then so is the great literature of the past. Charles Dickens, etc.</p>
<p>Adding to knowledge is one thing, subtracting from it is another.</p>
<p>I guess that the multiculturalist agenda thinks that ignorance is bliss. No, this is really a hostile attempt to destroy the British nation. A tragedy is in the works here. It shows malice aforethought. This is just plain hatred and contempt for the British people and for Western Civilization. We are living in evil days.</p>

<p>This is very unnatural. I doubt that there&rsquo;s ever been anything like it in World History, in terms of thoroughness.</p>
<p>Apparently this means that students are also not assigned reading materials that are not thoroughly modern. How sad.</p>
<p>And just think! Not so long ago, when Britain was still British, the young people regularly studied Latin and Greek!</p>
<p>Even in my wildest imaginings, I did not expect the multicult to go this far. (In some dictionaries I&rsquo;ve seen in the U.S., these thoroughly modern technical words are added in an appendices at the end, arranged by topic.)</p>
<p>Thank God for online dictionaries! Parents should not waste money on anti-British propaganda support tools.</p>

I&rsquo;m not a native English speaker and despite that I came across all of those deleted animal terms during my reading. </p>

		<p>But Fr. John we don&rsquo;t want to wait until Judgement Day for Vineeta Gupta and the rest to respect our Christian and European heritage. We need the Parousia now, a Messiah to lead us now, and not as a scapegoat for our sins. The West has gone beyond atoning; it is being punished for its own good deeds.</p>

		<p>These are the fruits of centuries of inbreeding amongst the ruling class.  Britain&rsquo;s politicians and bureaucrats are clinically insane and must be institutionalized.  Nero played his fiddle while Rome burned, the British Parliament plays the fool by bastardizing their culture while allowing the total Islamization of the once Christian UK.  Multiculturalism and Diversity is insidious government mind control aimed at forcing British subjects to embrace the Muslims who are displacing them.  For the first time in their history the British subjects have surrendered their nation without firing a shot&hellip;        </p>

		<p>Britain no longer needs those words for plants and animals - they will soon all be extinct! The countryside needs to be concreted over for new housing for the endless stream of 3rd world immigrants and their huge and ever-increasing numbers of offspring. As the countryside does not serve the interests of &#8220;Moderate Muslims&#8221; and other brown and black types, it needs to go. Besides, it is too white by far!</p>

&#8220;I have to agree with the deletion of the animals &hellip; at least most of them. I&rsquo;m a grownup and even I don&rsquo;t know what some of those animals are, and have never had reason to.&#8221;</p>
<p>So you want to take all the words out of the dictionary that you have never heard before?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that rather undermine the whole point of a dictionary?<br>
Don&rsquo;t you think it might be a good idea to have words for things even though you don&rsquo;t &#8216;have reason to know&rsquo; them? Maybe other people might need them!</p>

		<p>This has nothing to do with the fact that the editor, British to the core is a Hindu. This is strictly a journalistic decision.<br>
I have not seen the book and it is not worth the trouble to find it but I am taking bets that the word &#8220;diwali&#8221; is in it.</p>

		<p>I just posted a comment on the Hindu in charge of the dictionary and decided to see if it was on line, it is not but on the children&rsquo;s dictionary page the word of the week is &#8220;diwali&#8221;</p>

<p>The present ruling class has nothing to do with the pre WW2 ruling class that did inbreed for centuries.  The present ruling class are the descendants of 19th century CofE clergy, school teachers and Methodist small businessmen.</p>
<p>Cherie Blair is very typical.  Very smart working class girl, got into university on merit, got a law degree.  Had the good luck to be just the right age for affirmative action for women and human rights law opportunities.  There will never be another Cheri Blair however.  Affirmative action for non whites and foreigners has barred even the brightest working class British whites from university.</p>
<p>Had Cheri been born in 1990 she would now be a candidate for a life on welfare because of racial discrimination against intelligent working class British whites.</p>
<p>The greatgrandparents of the ruling class were converted to marxism in the 1920&rsquo;s when Lenin created the Comintern.  They have continued the tradition.  </p>
<p>Many of the ruling class are third world immigrants positioned into the ruling class by marxist operatives.  One such is &#8220;Sir&#8221; Trevor Phillips.<br>

		<p>Have a look at this list carefully people and you&rsquo;ll find hints at their agenda. Except for &#8216;coomon sense&rsquo; of course.<br>
One thing I loved to do when I was a youngster with a moment indoors, was to look through my Mum&rsquo;s old Collin&rsquo;s English Dictionary. It has a cornucopia of archaic words with an explanation of their origin. Old Norse, English and French.<br>
Still have a look when I go around to visit.</p>

		<p>Under the circumstances I couldn&rsquo;t believe that Gupta and Co. would really have the audacity to make &#8216;diwali&rsquo; the word of the week. </p>

<p>It seems that the person ultimately responsible for deciding what words our (British) children should know, is a Hindu immigrant. The Oxford University Press is a private company, so, despite their obvious social responsibility, are free to publish whatever they choose (providing it&rsquo;s politically correct and doesn&rsquo;t offend Islam of course). Personally I&rsquo;ve made a note of this dictionary and will certainly not be purchasing it, nor any other product from OUP for that matter now. Unfortunately the bulk purchases of these books will be by state schools, which are overwhelmingly staffed and controlled by the usual PC feminist drones (incidentally the same ones who are now completely failing white &#8216;working-class&rsquo; boys). Even those few with reservations about buying politically censored books will be intimidated into doing so.</p>
