			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Ross, ABC News, December 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chicago Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., is the anonymous &#8220;Senate Candidate No. 5&#8221; whose emissaries Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich reportedly offered up to $1 million to name him to the U.S. Senate, federal law enforcement sources tell ABC News.</p>
<p>According to the FBI affidavit in the case, Blagojevich &#8220;stated he might be able to cut a deal with Senate Candidate 5 that provided Rod Blagojevich&#8221; with something &#8220;tangible up front.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson said this morning he was contacted Tuesday by federal prosecutors in Chicago whom he said &#8220;asked me to come in and share with them my insights and thoughts about the selection process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson said, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know&#8221; when asked whether he was Candidate No. 5, but said he was told &#8220;I am not a target of this investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson said he agreed to talk with federal investigators &#8220;as quickly as possible&#8221; after he consulted with a lawyer.</p>
<p>The congressman, a son of the famed civil rights leader, denied that anyone had been authorized to make payments or promises to the governor on his behalf.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the [FBI] affidavit, Blagojevich threatened to appoint Senate Candidate No. 5 if President-elect Obama refused to help get his wife on &#8220;paid corporate boards right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The FBI says that during an Oct. 31 conversation, Blagojevich described an approach from an associate of Senate Candidate 5: &#8220;We were approached &lsquo;pay to play.&rsquo; That, you know, he&rsquo;d raise me 500 grand. An emissary came. Then the other guy would raise a million, if I made him [Senate Candidate 5] a senator.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jackson said Tuesday that he met with Blagojevich Monday &#8220;for the first time in years&#8221; and voiced his desire to fill Obama&rsquo;s empty Senate seat. He said he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; by Blagojevich&rsquo;s arrest, adding that &#8220;if these allegations are proved true, I am outraged by the appalling, pay-to-play schemes hatched at the highest levels of our state government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson is only one of a number of Illinois political figures whom the FBI is expected to interview in Chicago and Washington. But fellow Illinois Democratic Reps. Luis Gutierrez, Jan Schakowsky and Danny Davis, as well as Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, all say they have not been contacted by the FBI or prosecutors in connection to the Blagojevich investigation.</p>
<p>Madigan has confirmed, however, that she is Senate Candidate #2 in the affidavit, but she denied having any conversations with Governor Blagojevich about the Senate seat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are strong indications that Candidate 1 may be Valerie Jarrett, Obama&rsquo;s close confidante who has since been named a special presidential adviser. Senate Candidate 1 is identified in the federal documents as an adviser to the president-elect.</p>
<p>Durbin said Blagojevich was considering Jarrett until she withdrew her name from consideration. &#8220;The governor asked me if I thought she [Jarrett] was serious about not being appointed and I said, &lsquo;yes, she told me point blank that she was,&rsquo;&#8221; Durbin said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Illinois Governors have a two-term limit:  One in office, and the other in Federal prison.</p>
<p>To show you what kind of a phony Blagojevich is, Illinois is one of the few states that requires anyone who owns any firearms to get a state Firearms Owner Identification Card (FOID).  Even though I think the whole concept of a FOID amounts to unconstitutional prior restraint, the reason it&rsquo;s not a big issue in Illinois is that it&rsquo;s only $5.  Before he was Governor, RodB wanted to raise the price of the FOID to $500, which would have been a pyrrhic victory for the anti-gun nuts, for it would have forced the FOID into the courts, at which time they would have nullified it, and/or hastened statehood for Southern Illinois.  He had to backtrack on that when he first ran for Governor in 2002, and in fact, he ran ads in the St. Louis market and the Carbondale-Marion market (and probably a few more) explicitly promising no FOID card price increase, &ldquo;ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it turns out, he has one himself, though that does not prove that he owns guns.  Be that as it may, he has to relenquish his FOID and any guns he has, because he is now under indictment for a felony.</p>

		<p>* Jesse Jackson Sr. is a &#8220;famed civil rights leader&#8221;?</p>
<p>* Jesse Jr. agreed to talk as &#8220;quickly as possible&#8221; with prosecutors? Translated = he wants to cut the best deal for himself.</p>
<p>* How is Jackson going to raise $1 million? Answer = more shakedowns.</p>

		<p>I think the one million was just demanded of Jackson.  What a state. I have relatives in the Chicago suburbs.  They have regarded Chicago politics as on going entertainment, better than most of the TV shows.</p>
<p>I believe that 3 out of the last 7 governors have been imprisoned for felonies.</p>
<p>Illinois is 80 percent white, 15 percent black.  But the Chicago blacks and white liberals control the state.  Although Ill. is 80 percent white, affirmative action blacks hold about 45 percent of state government jobs, 30 percent over quota.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to &#8220;disproportionate representation is in and of itself clear and present evidence of discrimination&#8221; Chief Justice Brennan.</p>
<p>Brennan was one of the most vicious white hating Supreme Court judges ever.  He hated whites even more than Darth Vader Ginsburg does.  The above was part of his findings in Kaiser v Weber and Griggs v Duke power.</p>
<p>In Kaiser v Weber Brennan&rsquo;s court ruled that it was discriminatory against blacks to require that steel mill foremen have high school diplomas and pass a 8th grade level literacy and numeracy test. In other words, a steel mill foreman should be able to read and understand the operations manual and memos.  </p>
<p>He should also be able to figure out &#8220;If your department must have 18 people working at all times, and 26 people work in your department, how many people can go on vacation at one time?&#8221;</p>
<p>In Griggs vs Duke Power, Brennan&rsquo;s court ruled that it was discriminatory against blacks for the power company to require graduation from middle school (6th grade) as a requirement for employment.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I thought mistakenly that the process was fair,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>How could the process be fair, Junior, if they considered you for the spot?  You&rsquo;re nothing but a practiced talking head who has rehearsed sounding well-spoken for so long under the tutorage of Hollwood experts you are doing nothing but recitations almost everytime you open your mouth.</p>
<p>This man sounds like an absolute fool without a pre-written speech or if he has to speak off the cuff.</p>
<p>Not one time has he been able to expound in depth with anything close to intelligence about anything asked of him, which is rare, because he seldom places himself in a position where he has not been able to rehearse his assertions and answers in advance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Methinks thou protesteth too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in big trouble now.  If he&rsquo;s not indicted, forever will he be tainted, and thank God for that, because he&rsquo;s no more than another black moron that could have bought his way into a position where he could cause great harm to the country because of his stupidity.</p>
<p>I notice too, that one of Obama&rsquo;s lackies has warned the world that the Governor is going to &#8220;start&#8221; telling lies about Obama, so he can bring him down also.  Really?  For what reason would the governor want to bring down Obama?  Doesn&rsquo;t make sense does it?</p>
<p>A unilateral denial before any accusations are made?  Gee, I wonder if it might be for the purpose of launching a defense, because the Obama-ites know full well that the Obamanation is in this up to his eyeballs?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a situation where a murderer has been caught,<br>
and it&rsquo;s common knowledge he&rsquo;s going to give up his co-conspirator, so the co-conspirator&rsquo;s lawyer calls a press conference and tells the world that the confessed murderer is going to start telling lies about his client, which, in effect, just advertises his guilt.</p>
<p>God, this is funny.  Priceless entertainment.  Black lack of logic is rubbing off on the whites, they&rsquo;ve been around them so long in Chicago. </p>

		<p>Illinois can save a lot of money if they just send their candidates for Governor directly to jail, and skip the parts where they campaign and serve. In the end that would save everyone a lot of time and expense.</p>

<p>And so begins the first, and hopefully last chapter of, &#8220;Third World USA?&#8221;</p>
<p>I will not speculate too far into the future; however, it is my hope that Comrade BO and (of course) JJ, Jr. get ground right into the garbage disposal of what we have come to call, &#8220;politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watch MSNBC or even FOX tonight, they are all looking for &#8220;cover&#8221; of some kind for our collective mulatto &#8220;savior;&#8221; however, are they going to find it?</p>
<p>I think not!</p>
<p>Or, as might be better put, let the games begin!!!</p>

		<p>The apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree&hellip; per an ancient bit of popular wisdom. Predictably the son of the Grand Extortionist is wriggling like a speared viper, trying to distance himself from that scandal. Whether you, I, or anyone BELIEVES Jackson, Jr. is a matter of personal choice. Blacks, not especially noted for mental acuity, would gladly see him in the Senate.</p>

		<p>I have a feeling that, eventually, all charges against Blagojevich will be dropped.  After all, everyone who was involved with him was also involved with Obama.  So, they cannot convict RB without also involving BO, and, of course, that is something the PC&rsquo;ers are not willing to do.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought&hellip;Barack was told he would not be prosecuted under any circumstances but he would have to tow the line when asked to by the FBI. That is why he said with utter confidence that he never talked with the representatives of the governor, when in fact he, or his rep, may have been recorded as doing so and he knew it. The FBI has changed from the Hoover days but the culture may have not changed that much; that culture promoted &#8220;getting something on&#8221; politicians the agency felt were ideologically dangerous. I think we will see a tamed Obama in the years ahead. I am sure he was warned off a leftist tangent by the intelligence agencies already, and this action seals the deal.</p>

Corrupt pols of every stripe are, of course, to be abhorred, rooted out, and punished. On a nationwide basis, I don&rsquo;t know if either side could make the case that they are clearly and definitively the &#8220;cleaner&#8221; of the two parties. <br>
 <br>
But there&rsquo;s no question that in Chicago the &#8220;dirtier&#8221; of the two parties is the Democrats. And the Chicago Machine is the scene our new Democrat President CHOSE for his political career. So we&rsquo;re looking at four years of dunderheaded socialist schemes AND corrupt, untrustworthy, Third World-style grifting and grafting. Redistribution of the wealth by bureaucrats is bad enough without those bureaucrats being &#8220;bent.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
Like I&rsquo;ve been saying: an Obama admin is the worst of all possible worlds. No upside to this guy at all. None. Just a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; of awfulness. </p>

		<p>JJ Jr&rsquo;s press conference denying any connections to these crimes were actually a series of threats aimed at prosecutors, politicans and the media, he will not be touched by this episode and very likely will become the US senator from Il., as to the money to buy this seat, I think the Jackson family has wealth in 40-50 million range, and the financial backers who would luv to see him in the senate would gladly donate to his cause. It will be mostly ignored by media, but the fact that this senate seat is so valuable that there are offers of millions, this should wake up some voters as to th fraud in our goverment.</p>
