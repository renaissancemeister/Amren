<h1>Low-Income Residents Are Losing Out, No Thanks to the Black Pols Who Represent Them</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Henry Adams, New York Daily News, December 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>All New York neighborhoods change over time, some dramatically. But new census numbers show that Harlem, long the political and cultural capital of African-American life, is on the verge of being lost forever. That would not only deeply diminish New York City but would weaken the national political clout of blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ironically occurring at a time when an African-American has just been voted into the highest office in the land. It is doubly ironic that the neighborhood&rsquo;s current political leadership &mdash; which itself is African-American &mdash; deserves much of the blame.</p>
<p>A series of scandals concerning Rep. Charles Rangel&rsquo;s vacation retreat and fund-raising efforts have been all over the news lately. They haven&rsquo;t mattered all that much to most Harlemites. What matters far more to them is the fact that Rangel and Gov. Paterson are neighbors, with spacious rent-stabilized apartments, in the same luxury complex.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Policies supported by most of Harlem&rsquo;s black elected officials, but opposed by local community boards, have spurred the area&rsquo;s economic revival. The Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, the upzoning of 125th St. and Columbia University&rsquo;s push to expand by 17 acres all have spurred an atmosphere of speculative excitement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually a good thing when a neighborhood is upwardly mobile. But the frenzy has left many Harlemites &mdash; let&rsquo;s be honest, lower-income black and Latino folk &mdash; on the outside looking in.</p>
<p>Since 2000, as Harlem&rsquo;s median household income has risen by nearly 20%, the number of white residents in Harlem has more than tripled. The incomes of whites in the neighborhood climbed by 52%; that of blacks increased by just 9%.</p>
<p>Making reelection into an art form, incumbent politicians weren&rsquo;t trying to offend voters, but to bring about a new Harlem Renaissance. Bottom line: With the cost of real estate skyrocketing (the average price of a new condo hovers around $900,000), most long-term inhabitants just can&rsquo;t afford it. For all the talk about building affordable housing, the action doesn&rsquo;t match the rhetoric.</p>
<p>Never mind, insist Rangel and others. They concede housing prices are a problem, but think new apartments &mdash; even expensive ones &mdash; are better than boarded-up buildings.</p>
<p>They try to reassure us: Despite big changes, Harlem will stay Harlem.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Interviewing the powerful Harlem congressman on this subject in 2007, Mark Jacobson wrote in New York magazine, &#8220;There&rsquo;s some irony that Rangel, a link to an earlier, more flamboyant uptown, will be remembered as a prime mover to this shinier, corporate version. It is a legacy that will no doubt preclude the rise of another Charlie Rangel.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is happening just about everywhere. Like Harlem, Cincinnati&rsquo;s Over-the-Rhine, New Orleans and even the notorious Watts section of L.A. all confront gentrification.</p>

		<p>So when blacks move into white neighborhoods, whites can&rsquo;t say that they are destroying the neighborhood without being &#8220;racist&#8221;. However, the MSM is publishing an article by a (presumably) black columnist about how whites are ruining Harlem. I&rsquo;m not asking anyone to change their beliefs, but is a little consistancy too much to ask? </p>

		<p>This gentrification is relatively new.  Check back in ten years, in places like Harlem, Watts, and Over-The-Rhine, and similar places in St. Louis.  We&rsquo;ll see how many whites are still living there, especially after they have children, and find out their public school system is New York, L.A., Cincinnati and St. Louis.</p>

		<p><i>Harlem, long the political and cultural capital of African-American life, is on the verge of being lost forever.

Neither New York City nor America will lose anything worthwhile with the loss of either &#8220;black&#8221; Harlem or &#8220;black political clout.&#8221;  On the other hand, it might make New York a safer, more graceful, and more liveable place.<br/>

		<p>This is why it is impossible to ever please Blacks.  If a black neighborhood is a slum, then that is because of evil, racist Whites.  If white taxpayer money is poured into that neighborhood, improving it so that real estate values rise, then that&rsquo;s &#8220;Destroying historical black neighborhoods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing the White man can do will ever satisfy Blacks. It is probably best that blacks be allowed to live in their own homelands, where they can build the societies that they want.</p>

<p>I wonder if they wrote a similar piece when whites were forced out and Harlem became blacks. &#8216;Whites losing clout?&rsquo; &#8216;There goes the white neighborhood, lost forever?&rsquo; I doubt any such concerns made their way into the paper even during segregation and Jim Crow.</p>
<p>Again, the <b>Black Golden Rule</b> applies: That which is white must be made black. That which is black must remain black.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It&rsquo;s ironically occurring at a time when an African-American has just been voted into the highest office in the land.

<p><i>&#8220;They concede housing prices are a problem, but think new apartments &mdash; even expensive ones &mdash; are better than boarded-up buildings.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Most white people I associate with would be happy to see new and refurbished apartments instead of boarded-up buildings. It must be a white thing (seeing a neighborhood getting better that is).</p>
<p>Remember this: Blacks turned Harlem into a ghetto and called it &#8216;black culture&rsquo;. Whites are reclaiming what they originally built.<br/>

		<p>The reason the number of whites in Harlem has tripled is because the rents in NYC are so high that no white working man can afford them. The only nearly affordable property on Manhattan island is in Harlem. Even there it is way out of the price range of most working class people.</p>
<p>I would go so far as to say that every single black or hispanic living in Harlem must be on some kind of section 8 or other government housing program and all or most of the whites are paying extortionate rents just to live in tiny apartments in the ghetto.</p>
<p>If all government housing assistance were cut off tomorrow, 90% of the ethnic minorities in Manhattan would leave, house prices and rents would fall drastically and ordinary working class whites who pay their own rents and mortgages would once again be able to live in a near crime free metropolis with affordable housing.</p>

		<p>What the mainstream media are afraid of is a Harlem Renaissance II.  This would damage their simplistic narrative of Black=Good, White=bad.  When White cause a Renaissance of their own, which exposes Black incompetency, the Media have to put a bad spin on it.  They are an absolute insult to my intelligence!</p>

		<p>Virtually every urban neighborhood in the United States outside the deep South (and many there, too) was white long before it turned black. Every last urban neighborhood in the United States was planned, designed and built by whites. Urban life is not native to blacks, and their behavior in Harlem, Detroit, East St. Louis, the south side of Chicago and myriad other places is ample proof of how unfit blacks in the aggregate are for urban civilization. </p>

<p>A lie.  Whites have continued to move out of urban areas in excess of the numbers moving in.  In those few neighborhoods where gentrification does occur, the gentrified neighborhood is almost always a formerly white one, as with Harlem.  This is so because the structures built by the former white residents tend to be relatively large and architecturally attractive, having been built for middle and upper-middle class people.</p>
<p>Of course, the media never mentions that these neighborhoods were originally built and inhabited by whites.  Often these &#8220;historically black&#8221; neighborhoods only became black as recently as the 1970s.  TRULY historically black neighborhoods harldly exist: they have long since been bulldozed and covered over by public housing   &mdash;   the crude plank houses that once stood there having succumbed to the urban renewal schemes of the 1950s and 1960s.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is probably best that blacks be allowed to live in their own homelands (former comment), where they can build the societies that they want.  But the world jumped on South Africa when that is just what they wanted to do and history will prove it was a very good plan.  There are cries about cholera in Zim, but a couple of years ago, many were dying of this unnecessarily disease on the East Rand near Johannesburg in South Africa.  But no cries then as it was hushed up.  Perhaps it is the African way of keeping populations down.</p>
<p>I read that gold production is down 14% this year due to electrical power cuts there as the new Marxist government have screwed up the long term planning and wasted the cash left to them on weapons so they can stay in power.  Even new factories have been discouraged as there is not enough power.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;and even the notorious Watts section of L.A. all confront gentrification&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ha!  Watts re-gentrified? Sez who?</p>
<p>I had the extreme displeasure of attending a mandated teachers&rsquo; meeting in the heart of Watts not too long ago and I got a good, long hard look at the hell-hole that it is (originally settled by Italian immigrants, the Watts towers were constructed by one such immigrant, of course the blacks take credit for this only &#8216;cultural&rsquo; point of interest in all of Watts, but I digress).</p>
<p>Before I ventured into &#8216;Watts&rsquo; (now called South LA  &mdash;   South-Central LA was too stigmatizing to the government leeches that reside there) I made damn sure my car was gassed up and in good working order and my cell phone was handy with 911 on the speed dial  &mdash;  if I were to break down there, my body would never be found.</p>
<p>I saw nothing except degradation and despair in Watts  &mdash;  a school I passed looked exactly like a prison surrounded by a large inwardly-curved fence complete with sharp spikes on the end of each fence stake and &#8216;guards&rsquo; with walkie-talkies roaming the exterior of the grounds.  I also noted packs of roving stray dogs, large amounts of trash strewn in the gutters, crazily dressed women standing on every corner, including directly in front of the school.  Businesses include liquor stores, fish fry joints, gas stations with men standing around ready to &#8216;gas up&rsquo; the next customer (I was strongly warned to never stop at one of these stations; by the time you are gassed up, your credit card number has already been processed and is on the street).</p>
<p>The one thing I certainly didn&rsquo;t see was Whites  &mdash;  it would be suicide for them to live there what with the following crime statistics:</p>
<p>Personal Crime Risk Index:  190  &mdash;  Watts  124  &mdash;  California  100  &mdash;  US  <br/>
Murder Risk Index:  207  &mdash;  Watts  126  &mdash;  California  100  &mdash;  US</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get out of there, I&rsquo;m glad I have tinted windows on my car.  If I&rsquo;m ordered back down there, I swear I&rsquo;ll take a sick day.</p>
<p>Bon  <br/>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised it took so long for the effects of the black-run government to manifest itself.  SA will implode as has every other black-run government. Don&rsquo;t worry, the US is right behind you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the latest news from SA:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;in one year the rand has lost 40% of its value&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;JOHANNESBURG - Ratings agency Fitch has revised the ratings outlook for South Africa from stable to negative&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;South Africa has the highest prevalence of HIV in the world&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And again, SAs crime rate:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;45 violent house invasions a day, 50 murders a day, 140 rapes a day&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>SA Whites, as they are in the US, are considered expendable, their private property, the fruits of their labor open to government confiscation and redistribution.</p>
<p>As Pat Buchanan writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;All about us we can see clearly now that the West is passing away&hellip; As a share of world population, peoples of European ancestry have been shrinking for three generations. The character of every Western nation is being irremediably altered as each undergoes an unresisted invasion from the third World. We are slowly disappearing from the Earth&hellip;&#8221;</p>
