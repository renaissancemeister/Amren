			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Shears, Daily Mail (London), November 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Papua New Guinea jungle has given up one of its darkest secrets &mdash; the systematic slaughter of every male baby born in two villages to prevent future tribal clashes.</p>
<p>By virtually wiping out the &lsquo;male stock&rsquo;, tribal women hope they can avoid deadly bow-and-arrow wars between the villages in the future.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Babies grow into men and men turn into warriors,&rsquo; said Rona Luke, a village wife who is attending a special &lsquo;peace and reconciliation&rsquo; meeting in the mountain village of Goroka.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s because of the terrible fights that have brought death and destruction to our villages for the past 20 years that all the womenfolk have agreed to have all new-born male babies killed,&rsquo; said Mrs Luke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The women have had enough of men engaging in tribal conflicts and bringing misery to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sensational claims recall the Biblical story of the Old Testament pharaoh who ordered all midwives to kill Israelite baby boys because he wanted to ensure there were never enough young men to fight in an army against the Egyptians.</p>
<p>Mrs Luke said that the village women agreed that if they stopped producing males, allowing only female babies to survive, their tribe&rsquo;s stock of boys would go down and there would be no men in future to fight.</p>
<p>A resident of Agibu village, Mrs Luke said she did not know how many male babies were killed by being smothered, but it had happened to all males over a 10 year period &mdash; and she suggested it was still happening.</p>
<p>Choking back tears she added: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible, unbearable crime, but the women had to do it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The women have really being forced into it as it&rsquo;s the only means available to them as women to bring an end to tribal fights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Confirming the shocking infanticide claims, Mrs Kipiyona Belas from the rival Amosa village, told a newspaper that getting food for their families was difficult because husbands were fighting other tribes with bows-and- arrows and spears.</p>
<p>Often the men did not come back, having been killed on the &lsquo;battle field&rsquo;, usually a clearing in the jungle.</p>
<p>Now, with the help of the Salvation Army and the initiative of local Pastor Michael Hemuno, the tribal women hope the slaughter of babies can end and those men who are still warriors will lay down their weapons and talk peace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are trying to get them to live peacefully and end all the deaths of young and old,&rsquo; said Pastor Hemuno.</p>
<p>Tribal fighting in the region of Gimi, in the country&rsquo;s Eastern Highlands, has been going on since 1986, many of the clashes arising over claims of sorcery.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea tribes, who dress up in warrior paint and feathered finery for special occasions, are strong believers in sorcery and often blame their enemies for bringing about deaths through witchcraft.<br>

		<p>It strikes me as strange that the fathers of these babies didn&rsquo;t notice that they have had no male children for 10 years! </p>
<p>While this isn&rsquo;t a group of intelligent individuals, you&rsquo;d think it might have occured to them that there was something odd going on.</p>

		<p>Hmmmm. It also removes the competition for women, and ensures that the older men will have a monopoly on women to impregnate.  I suspect that is the real reason for this gender-specific genocide.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if their goals will be accomplished.  After all, I don&rsquo;t know how it is among indigenous New Guineans, but I have found that black women, while not as aggressive as black men, can be pretty aggressive in their own right.  If this is true among indigenous Guineans, I think that women will be fighting with each other instead of men.</p>

		<p> This is a gruesome, typical example of the nonsensical feminist notion that peace and brotherhood (oops! make that sisterhood) would reign all over the world if only they could get rid of all the men. Look at the wars of Queen Elizabeth I, Queen Victoria and Margaret Thatcher if you think that female rulers always preside over peace.</p>
<p> And by the way, what do these pea-brained women think is going to happen when the girls born during that 10 years reach maturity and there are no men for them to marry? None in their age group, anyway. It sounds like the reverse of China&rsquo;s idiotic policy of one child per family, which has resulted in a marked shortage of women (due to infanticide committed against girl babies) for the men to marry and have children with. Ditto the preference in India for male babies, with female babies often quietly disposed of so the couple can &#8220;try again for a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p> Finally, what were the men of these two tribes doing for these 10 years that the women were allegedly &#8220;killing every male baby&#8221;? Don&rsquo;t you suppose they started to suspect something was wrong? Is it possible this whole story was made up by someone out of whole cloth?</p>

		<p>Who cares what they do in New Guinea?  As long as they don&rsquo;t try to come to the White world I sure don&rsquo;t.  Then again, are our problems really that different?  We abort millions of babies every year, but still have trouble with feral black males.  </p>

If only this practice could be imported into our western countries where young black males also indulge in daily tribal fighting on our streets.

<p>I&rsquo;ll grant them credit that at least they were able to &#8220;think outside the box&#8221; and come up with a solution    &mdash;   which is more than we seem able to do. </p>
<p>We need more original thinking and less doctrinaire restrictions in regards to our own problems.</p>
<p>As for their society going extinct   &mdash;   not likely, not if they practice polygamy. And as someone said above, the older males will get all the younger females&hellip;(maybe that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re not complaining).<br>

		<p>Kudos to Yorkshire Man for his insight.  I&rsquo;ve long wondered whether black women are tempted to do as those New Guinea women did.  I live in the South, and grew up around blacks.  So I grew up hearing, straight from black women, about the horrendous treatment they endured from black men. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being some poor black woman, beaten and abused by her husband, her father, her preacher, and no telling how many other men, and then seeing her infant male as anything other than a future abuser.</p>
<p>So to those women in New Guinea, I can only say, &#8220;You GO, girls!  Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Just don&rsquo;t come over here and try a stunt like that.&#8221; </p>
<p> Missionaries need to keep their noses out of other people&rsquo;s cultures.  I remember hearing on NPR, about some newly-discovered tribe of headhunters.  The Catholic Mission was on their case faster than the anthropologists could study them.  At the mission, the headhunters were being shown RAMBO movies, of all things.  Primitive, violent males being shown primitive, violent males on steroids&hellip;with guns!  I doubt Jesus would approve.</p>
<p>And anyone who thinks the tribe will go extinct with fewer males needs to consider that one male can impregnate hundreds and hundreds of females in one year.  Grew up on a farm.  Seen it done.  And remember that Celtic tradition where the biggest, most strapping male &#8216;knew&rsquo; all the tribe&rsquo;s women during his &#8216;special year&rsquo;?  Celts did just fine, and certainly were not threatened with extinction&hellip;.that is, up until November fourth, 2008&hellip;</p>
<p>As to criticizing the Chinese for their &#8216;absurd&rsquo; one-child policy&hellip;..that&rsquo;s THEIR business.  By the way: how&rsquo;d you like to be born a girl in a society where girls are seen as having no value?  How&rsquo;d you like to spend the rest of your miserable life a virtual slave, living in a factory dorm and working for pennies a day?  That&rsquo;s the fate those Chinese parents are saving their daughters from.  Life is hard over there (mostly because of the population problem), and those people have to make far tougher choices than we have to in America.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for respecting other people&rsquo;s cultures, as long as &#8216;other people&rsquo; stay where they belong, and out of America.  We need to let people figure things out on on their own (and stop subsidizing the breeding habits of the whole world).</p>

		<p>Have these &#8220;would be&#8221; Feminists thought this one through? <br>
After they kill off most of the fighting men in their villages, who will defend these villages from attack by men from other villages?  Assuming that these progressive women have no high tech weapons, only rifles and machetes,  they will be quickly captured and enslaved by groups that do not practice male infanticide. <br>
Feminism can only be sustained in a high technology society.</p>

<p>What are they going to do? How about who is going to protect them?</p>
<p>Bottom Line - if their men, who are genetically related to them treat them badly, imagine how badly men from OTHER tribes will treat them when there are no men left to protect them.</p>
<p>Basic marginal economics and all that (but hey, it was their choice).</p>

		<p>To A Brainwashed Canadian:</p>
<p>I believe you misinterpreted the gist of my post. It had nothing to do with economics. Instead, the point I was trying to make is that, boys are being killed by their mothers at the same time that men are killing each other. Who will the girls mate with and have sex with, if the male population will be decimated by war and infanticide?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard the stories how American and European pedophiles will fly to SE Asia to have sex with minor children? What if some enterprising travel agency got the idea to portray Papua New Guinea as a place where lesbians around the world could travel to, meet and have sex with young girls? Consider how such an ad might go:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lesbians, are you tired of the same old bar scene and routine? Want to put some spice in your life? Then, come to a place where you can meet young ladies who are ready to cater to your every sapphic pleasure and desire. In a lush, tropical environment, far away from it all, you can meet girls who will give you an unforgettable time. And, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about men who don&rsquo;t understand you -there are no men to speak of.</p>
<p>Where is this paradise of Sappho? Why, it&rsquo;s Papua New Guinea. A whole different world. Where the girls come out to play. See your travel agent&#8221;.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting thought.  I happen to work with a black woman, with whom I&rsquo;m quite  friendly.   I&rsquo;ve known her for years.   She has NO male relatifves.

Her entire family, in each generation, is composed solely of females&hellip; from her grandmothers to her granddaughters   &mdash;    all girls.  It&rsquo;s amazing, and I&rsquo;ve joked with her that her family ought be the subject of a scientific study!</p>
<p>What few males were in anywhere the picture  (though not blood relatives) - such as husbands and her step-father   &mdash;   were all junkies, jailbirds, thieves, cheaters and abusers. Bad news all.   She&rsquo;s just as glad to be without them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Have these &ldquo;would be&rdquo; Feminists thought this one through? <br>
After they kill off most of the fighting men in their villages, who will defend these villages from attack by men from other villages?&#8221;<br>

<p>If you read the story, it said they did this  <i>by agreement with </i>women from the other villages.<br>
==========<br>
&#8220;Who will the girls mate with and have sex with, if the male population will be decimated by war and infanticide?&#8221;<br>

<p>Ever heard of a thing callled polygamy?  The story never said every last male would be exterminated down to zero.  </p>

		<p>Interesting. Kill your own baby boys to prevent future wars, fought with arrows and spears. Did either side ever consider being the first to acquire firearms and wipe the other out entirely? Same result, double the fun!</p>

<p><i>&hellip;but I have found that black women, while not as aggressive as black men, can be pretty aggressive in their own right. If this is true among indigenous Guineans, I think that women will be fighting with each other instead of men.</i></p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll probably be fighting <i>over</i> the last men.</p>
