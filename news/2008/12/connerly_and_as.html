			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Bassett, St. Louis American, December 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Nov. 4, amid all of the excitement surrounding Barack Obama&rsquo;s election, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit struck down a Pentagon Program that included five-percent set-aside contracting for companies run by racial minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On that same day, Nebraska voters supported the anti-affirmative action initiative on their state ballot by a margin of 58 to 42 percent. By doing so, they joined voters in California, Washington and Michigan, who voted to ban affirmative action programs in previous years.</p>
<p>After four decades of affirmative action, Obama&rsquo;s historic candidacy itself has been seen by some as proof that such programs are no longer needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a big mistake for people to look into the White House and see a beautiful family there and say that the struggle is over,&#8221; said George Curry, a journalist and affirmative action expert. &#8220;The proof that we don&rsquo;t need affirmative action is when major corporations and higher institutions represent our composition in society.&#8221;</p>
<p>[George] Curry, author of The Affirmative Action Debate, said one problem with affirmative action is that most people fail to accurately define the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Affirmative action has never been just for black people,&#8221; Curry said. &#8220;One could argue that white women have benefited more from affirmative action than any minority group.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President-elect Obama has called traditional affirmative action &#8220;absolutely necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his speech on race in Philadelphia back in March, he made clear that America needs some form of affirmative action to address the legacy of discrimination in this country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fight to save affirmative action programs in The Show Me State will continue well into 2010.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Robin Carnahan&rsquo;s office announced last week that it had approved a proposed initiative to ban affirmative action programs in education, public contracting and employment for circulation again throughout the state.</p>
<p>The so-called Missouri Civil Rights Initiative &mdash; sponsored locally by Tim Asher, but with the national support of Ward Connerly &mdash; could have as late as May 2010 to gather signatures for the November ballot.</p>
<p>Connerly, a wealthy California political operative who is black, has spent millions in out-of-state spending in an attempt to amend Missouri&rsquo;s constitution. He and Asher failed to turn in signatures on time to qualify their initiative for this year&rsquo;s ballot.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Connerly also targeted four other states: Colorado, Nebraska, Arizona and Oklahoma. As in Missouri, he failed to gain enough qualified signatures to make the ballot for Arizona and Oklahoma. His initiative was barely defeated in Colorado, but passed in Nebraska.</p>
<p>If successful, Connerly&rsquo;s ballot measure would cut off government funding for programs offering preferential treatment based on gender or race.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It would be a big mistake for people to look into the White House and see a beautiful family there and say that the struggle is over,&rdquo; said George Curry, a journalist and affirmative action expert.&#8221;</p>
<p>What struggle?  You haven&rsquo;t succeeded as a group because of low intelligence and ability.  What does having a mulatto in the White House have to do with that?  I mean blacks still score lower academically than any other group in America.  Come on now, my man, Obama can&rsquo;t wave a magic wand and change that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proof that we don&rsquo;t need affirmative action is when major corporations and higher institutions represent our composition in society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If promotions and jobs are judged on ability and intelligence alone, then blacks will never be proportionate in the business world.  </p>
<p>And let me mention one other important item, if we continue on with this severe economic drop, then the AA fat will have to be trimmed from ALL corporations or they will face extinction, because they won&rsquo;t be able to pad their employment rolls with incompetents that have to be carried by others, all the while pretending they can do the job.</p>
<p>This economic drop is hurting my business severely, but, oh, how I love it.  If it gets any worse we&rsquo;ll all have to buy ear muffs if we don&rsquo;t want to hear the non-stop chorus of black whining.</p>
<p>Oh, and the universities?  With the huge drop in funds they&rsquo;re experiencing right now, will they too have to drop a black studies program and professor here and there and maybe special funding for blacks?</p>

		<p>The Connery org tried in MO in 2008, but they were organizationally inept, and denounced &#8220;white racists&#8221; (70% of whites who would vote for the Connery initiatives, duh).  He ticked off the very activists (CofCC members in St. Louis) that would have done the most legwork to get it on the ballot.</p>
<p>Also, to get an initiative on the ballot statewide on MO, you need some 20,000 signatures from at least two-thirds of the state&rsquo;s U.S. House districts, i.e. 6 out of 9.  MO-1 (St. Louis North) and MO-5 (Kansas City proper) are heavily black, so gathering signatures from those districts is out of the question.  So they&rsquo;re left with getting some 20,000 names from six out of the seven decent district.  Plus the Secretary of State is a Democrat, (Robin Carnahan), and she&rsquo;ll play games with the process.</p>

		<p>&#8220;he (Obama) made clear that America needs some form of affirmative action to address the legacy of discrimination in this country&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sounds like the legacy of discrimination in this country is 40 years of affirmative action. Most blacks are just like Obama. They think it&rsquo;s just peachy to engage in &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; even where it&rsquo;s not recommended or the law. This means at companies, and in neighborhoods, and at colleges where blacks are the majority - entire US states now, they still practice &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, with the same fervor as they do at state universities and at corporate &#8216;EEOC&rsquo; offices. It has nothing to do with reparations, fairness, equality, diversity, or any other word they are using and everything to do with pushing one race over another. <br>

<p>The implicit message in this statement is that Barack Obama and his family of African-Americans are beautiful and that the previous Presidents and their White families were not. </p>

		<p>In the 1960&rsquo;s the lying NAACP promised that affirmative action would only be needed for a decade.</p>
<p>Now they say it will be needed until there are an equal number of black and white CEOs/tycoons, something that will never happen due to genetics.</p>

From the &#8220;About Us&#8221; section of the St. Louis American&rsquo;s web page:</p>
<p><i>The St. Louis American Newspaper is Missouri&rsquo;s largest, most widely-read weekly newspaper targeted to African Americans. </i></p>
<p>This might explain why this &#8220;article&#8221; is essentially a platform for a pro-affirmative action activist to express his views.</p>

		<p>This country has gone insane over trying to accomodate inferiority.  Because of all this fooling around, this country is now next to Mexico in international academic testing.  This country used to be consistently first or second.  Why is that whites are always the ones trying to taking care of everyone else even the blacks in their own so call country?  Which racial group have ever taken care of the whites?  The answer to the questions, of course, is that the white race possess the highest genetic material possible so no racial group can ever reach the level of taking care of whites.  No racial group can ever reach the same technology and philosophy abilities as what the white race have accomplished.  It will be total regression for this planet if whites start inter-breeding with inferior genes.  The white need to shake off the constant brain washing using guilt currently imposed on them.  Using blacks as laborers/slaves were correct for its time as least it brought order into their lives.  They actually learned skills and respected some kind of law and order.  Now they are lost souls no matter where they are.  I find it extremely weird and dangerous that a black man is now president of a civilization built by whites.  Usually, this is a sign that a country/civilization is now on its last leg.  This is the pattern of past advanced civilizations when inferior genes have taken over a country. <br>

		<p>In an America with a shrinking job market, yet still more foreigners coming in every year, why do we still need yet more anti-white &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; programs?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, blacks and the other non-white races are going to push these and other programs as far as they can, as long as they can, until they have the same or more than whitey, and whitey has less to nothing.</p>

		<p>White Nationalists have been wondering when and how their ideas will hit the mainstream. </p>
<p>This is it! This is the issue, not Immigration. Ending Affirmative Action plays on peoples ideals of equal treatment and fairness. Focusing on immigration makes us look like we just don&rsquo;t want to compete. </p>
<p>Its time to use the leftest rhetoric of equality to our advantage. It&rsquo;s time equality meant equal treatment of individuals. A merit based society. No more stacking the deck in favor of &#8220;minorities&#8221;. </p>
<p>The door is wide open now we just need to step in. White parents (left, and political center) need to be made to feel a bit of shame, without over-doing -it, for voting for a candidate that openly advocates discrimination against their children. AA needs to be seen for what it is, discrimination. We need a new type of Republican candidate that speaks &#8220;a new language&#8221; of equality, equal treatment based on merit. It&rsquo;s time to use the medias buzz words and guilt tripping against itself.              </p>

<p>In case the importand positions in majos corporations are filled by the abilities of the applicants, the blacks may be doomed to be underpresented when IQ is the main criterium for selection.  Perhaps Mr. Curry can explain why basket ball teams are not required to represent the racial composition of the US population. <br>
