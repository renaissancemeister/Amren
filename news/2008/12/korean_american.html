<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-ocasian28-2008dec28,0,5233619.story">Korean Americans Find a Home in Fullerton</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>My-Thuan Tran, Los Angeles Times, December 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amerige Heights [in Orange County,California], just like the villages in Irvine and the newer housing tracts of Tustin, has become a destination for Asian Americans, drawn by high-performing schools, relatively crime-free neighborhoods and good jobs. According to recently released U.S. Census data, the Asian population in every city with available data in Orange County has gone up. Countywide, the Asian population has increased roughly 16% since 2000, a much faster rate than the Latino population and in the opposite direction of the white population, which has dropped nearly 8%.</p>
<p>Fullerton, once a traditionally white bedroom community in northern Orange County, has seen growing numbers of Asians moving into its middle-class neighborhoods such as Amerige Heights, where real estate agents estimate more than half of the residents are of Korean descent. To cater to them, smaller Korean churches have sprouted in the area, such as Crossway Community Church in Brea. Korean parents even started a Korean PTA at Sunny Hills High School, where Asian Americans make up half of the student body.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fullerton is now 21% Asian American &mdash; a 35% jump since 2000, according to detailed U.S. Census data that averages surveys from 2005 to 2007. The increase puts Fullerton among the cities with the fastest growing Asian American populations in Southern California.</p>
<p>The numbers are further proof of Orange County&rsquo;s accelerating diversification &mdash; Irvine, one of the model master-planned communities, is now dotted with Buddhist temples, Chinese banks and Asian grocery stores; central Orange County is home to the largest Vietnamese population outside of the country of Vietnam; and Santa Ana has one of the largest Latino populations in the nation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Koreans make up the second largest Asian ethnic group in Orange County, after Vietnamese. But unlike Vietnamese refugees who built the thriving business enclave of Westminster&rsquo;s Little Saigon, where block after block is filled with Vietnamese mom-and-pop shops, the imprint of Korean Americans has been far more gradual.</p>
<p>In Fullerton, there are no overwhelmingly Korean enclaves or neighborhoods. Instead, pockets of Korean bakeries, travel agencies, banks and markets have taken root.</p>
<p>Korean entrepreneurs are purchasing entire shopping centers in Fullerton and remaking them, such as an old Pavilions market that gave way to a Korean travel agency and tutoring center, said John Godlewski, Fullerton&rsquo;s community development director. He predicts the future will bring similar developments catering to Asian Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m getting calls from some of the older neighbors saying, &lsquo;We cannot read the signs. It&rsquo;s not written in English,&rsquo;&#8221; Godlewski said. &#8220;People see things are changing, that they are not the way they used to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can bet there are overwhelmingly Asian neighborhoods though. Perhaps they just don&rsquo;t know how wonderful diversity is, and no one is bothering to &#8216;educate&rsquo; them?</p>

		<p>Those Koreans were tough fighters in Vietnam. &#8220;The Korean soldiers won a reputation as the toughest and cruelest of any units from any force in the Vietnam War.&#8221; NYT The Vietcongs stayed away from them and boy were they disciplined. They didn&rsquo;t have R&R; like the American troops.</p>
<p>The blacks were lucky they weren&rsquo;t left to face the Koreans while burning and looting their stores. They would&rsquo;ve been massacred. <br>

You have clearly forgotten about the American military stationed in South Korea. According to China and the DPRK, America has no business being there and stalemating the war. The hypocrisy on your part is blinding. Unless I&rsquo;m missing something&hellip;do you LOVE South Korea? What about the American forces in Japan, around Taiwan and in the Philippines? Either get out of Asian lands now or eat your words. </p>

<p>Very simple.  Korea is not a large country.  They don&rsquo;t have room for people seeking opportunity.  <br>
Not that this is an excuse for them being so clannish and divisive in our country.  No excuse at all.</p>

<p>Exactly right. Where were the Whites confronting looters during the riots? This article is a &#8220;red herring&#8221;. I would trust these koreans more than the WICOs (Whites in Color Only)that have crippled our nation.</p>

<p>Posted by Raymond at 6:43 PM on December 30 &#8220;</p>
<p>Korean Girl here to help. It&rsquo;s not that hard, Raymond. Really. Let me tell you how we do it. </p>
<p>First generationers born and raised in Korea who emigrate to America probably get jobs sweeping out grocery stores and washing dishes, or maybe dumping construction debris boxes or any other type of manual labor-ish work. A first generationer will then take home his paycheck to his wife and child. </p>
<p>The first generation family won&rsquo;t vacation. They won&rsquo;t buy a new car. They won&rsquo;t buy new toys. They won&rsquo;t buy expensive gadgets. They won&rsquo;t dine out at restaurants. They won&rsquo;t buy jewelry for anniversary gifts. The husband, wife, and child will save approximately 50% of their earned income. </p>
<p>Assume basic income for husband of $35,000 per year. After taxes that&rsquo;s $22,750. A family of three will live on 50% of that income, which is roughly $11,375 per year, or $948 per month. Said first generation Korean family of three will live in a studio garage-converted unit with small bathroom and barely adequate kitchen for $400 per month. That leaves $548/month for food and clothing and other basic necessities. Each year, this family will save $11,375 in the bank. </p>
<p>Fast forward ten years. First generation Korean family now has $113,750 in the bank. Their child is ten years old. Still living in same tiny garage-studio conversion. Korean family will take that saved up money and make their first purchase, usually a store or stand of some sort. It&rsquo;s probably going to be a basic small convenience grocery store. They don&rsquo;t buy the real estate, but just the business and lease that goes along with it. Their $113,750 will act as a 33% down payment for a $341,250 grocery business. </p>
<p>Said Korean family will run the grocery store as if their lives depended on it. Everything will be in tip top shape. Every dime of profit that can be squeezed out of the business will be squeezed out of the business. The store will be a lean and mean capitalist machine in the purest sense. </p>
<p>Now, Raymond, back to your given salary of $62,000 per year. We&rsquo;ll assume this first generation Korean family now makes your $62,000 per year from their grocery store business. That is, to clarify, they have a take-home income, before taxes, but after expenses and inventory are deducted, or $62,000 per year. </p>
<p>How, you ask, can they live in California with that salary? (sorry I had to start with them having nothing. Needed to give you a background of where they were coming from)</p>
<p>Since they&rsquo;re making more money now, you&rsquo;d assume they&rsquo;d spend more money. You&rsquo;d be wrong. This Korean family will still live on their original $11,375 per year, or roughly $1,000 per month. </p>
<p>They see an increase in income not as an opportunity to spend more money, but as an opportunity to save more money. </p>
<p>Their grocery store take home salary of $62,000 after taxes of 35% would be $40,300 per year. That, minus their living expenses of $11,375 per year leaves them with $28,925 to save in the bank every year. </p>
<p>Fast forward 8 years. Korean family has taught their daughter the importance of frugality all her life. Korean daughter is 18 and ready for college. Her grades are impeccable. Her work ethic would make the original Protestants jealous. She goes to UCLA on a scholarship. She&rsquo;s premed and well on her way. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in these 8 years, her family now has saved up $202,475 cash in the bank from the grocery store. They now use that cash as a 20% down payment to purchase the building their business is in (this being in the 80&rsquo;s when the cost of money was a lot cheaper and 20% down payments for commercial properties was acceptable). That makes the entire purchase price of the building $1,012,375. </p>
<p>Now, mind you, the commercial building has more than just the grocery store. The upstairs has three apartment units of 2bedroom/1bath each, and downstairs has three commercial retail units of which the grocery store is just one tenant. </p>
<p>The Korean family moves their home upstairs in their new piece of real estate and runs their grocery store from above. Their loan on the property is $809,900 at 6.2% interest only, which translates into $50,214 per year, or $4,184 per month. </p>
<p>Assume each retail space on the ground floor has 1,000 sqft each, and each apartment unit on the second floor has 1,000 sqft each, making the entire building 6,000 sqft. Assume retail rents are $1.00 per square foot per month triple net (tenants pay expenses). Assume each apartment market rent of 2 bedrooms one bath of $1,000 per month. (for ease of calculation)</p>
<p>This means, Korean family, not counting their own store and apartment, but from just the two leased apartments and two leased retail spaces, are getting $4,000 per month in rental income. Add to that their income per month from the grocery store of $5,166 (their $62,000 per year divided by 12), and the deduction of $400 they need to pay out in rent to the former garage-studio aparment brings their passive and business income to a whopping total of $9,167 per month, or $110,000 per year. </p>
<p>Now, remember their mortgage is $4,184 per month. Add taxes and insurance and other related costs of owning real estate and we&rsquo;ll assume $5,000 per month mortgage costs (retail units pay own taxes due to triple net leases. Tenants in apartments are billed back their own utilities). </p>
<p>This leaves Korean family with monthly income of $4,167 per month, or $50,000 per year. </p>
<p>Fast forward 15 years, Raymond. I&rsquo;m their daughter. I&rsquo;m now 33. I&rsquo;m a doctor. My parents have since sold their original building after it more than doubled in value. From saving money from my medical practice and their small businesses (yes, plural. We&rsquo;ve since gone on to open a laundromat, a restaurant, and two more groceries), we now own multiple pieces of income producing real estate and my family has a net worth of over 6 million dollars. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we do it. </p>

		<p>Yes, Koreans from my experience are productive, hardworking and probably upstat people. Never had any problems with them. The only thing I feel uncomfortable with are their business signs in Korean only. Not the friendliest people but are basically law abiding- agreed.</p>

<p>They may be, for the most part, good, hard-working, and honourable people, but I think that being an American should extend beyond that. I thought this website was about preserving what is left of a white America? Funny me&hellip;</p>

<p>Maybe it is not a matter of safety for white Americans or the Koreans taking advantage of the welfare system.  It does not matter how smart or safe Koreans are.  I have been reading and posting on AmRen long enough to be aware of what AmRen is about: first, learn about the direct harms caused by legal and illegal immigrants from the third world, secondly, preserve the white culture and heritage in North America and Europe.  Very likely AmRen members would be concerned with the second part, if there are too many Korean immigrants in one particular area.  It does not matter how smart or safe Koreans are.  If there are too many non-white Americans of any ethnicity in one particular area, then the preservation of white culture and heritage might be in question?  I can certainly understand that even if I am Korean </p>

<p>Where are you finding this great display of white culture and heritage? Is it in the dusty back section of the public library?I know that I can&rsquo;t even mention White anything without putting my job in jeopardy.</p>
<p>I have no worries about Korean immigrants in one particular area.<br>
I am more worried about busybodies moving Section Eighters into my neighborhood or 15 illegal aliens moving into a two-bedroom house.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking me to be concerned about someone leaving the sink running on the Titanic.</p>

Thanks for the clarification. I thought this was a race realist website where pc lies were debunked and people in the online community can have a truthful discussion about the merits and demerits of each race without having to worry about losing their jobs or reputation. </p>
<p>But, in reality, Joe, you&rsquo;re right. This may be a white nationalist site in disguise. </p>

		<p>Korean Girl: Americans don&rsquo;t feel that they should have to live in a squalid slum in order that they may afford to live in any of the American States.  Fifty years ago, before mass immigration created vast swaths of bario land and forced Whites into expensive enclaves, plenty of working class Whites could and did buy houses in southern California, even though it had higher land costs.  I am curious, though.  Why did your parents choose California instead of one of the less expensive states?  Wouldn&rsquo;t their limited resources have gone further in, say, Arkansas?  </p>

		<p>Korean girl is being a bit disingenuous. ALL non-whites are &#8220;eligible&#8221; for money and programs funded by whites.  One could spend months just looking into govt programs and policies that yes, favor Asians just as they do blacks and Hispanics and still not get through them all.  For instance, most whites are not aware the the SBA will grant business and home(!) loans to non-whites. Asians also play the &#8220;no profit&#8221; game with their businesses. They run a cash business (store, motel etc) for three years, claiming no profit. Then they claim to be selling it (to friends or relatives) while actually still retaining the biggest percentage of the profits. This goes on for three years, and then the unprofitable business is &#8220;sold&#8221; again, to another relative or friend (who may times has recently arrived via daisy-chain immigration).  This is just a small part of the advantages and games available and played by non-whites in a system set up to help them at the expense of whites. Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s name comes up, but he was just a paid shill, a sponsor of the Immigration Act of 1965 that mandates 90% of legal immigrants must be non-white. Do some research on the history of that piece of legislation, it will be an eye-opener. </p>
<p>CA apparently was chosen by elites as the area to conduct the experiment, before pushing it on to the rest of the country. The Koreans, Vietnamese, Cambodians and more all can take advantage of govt programs just like blacks and Latinos, they&rsquo;re just smarter. But their success isn&rsquo;t all due to hard work. It is interesting how vociferously Asians will deny a lot of this, and then when you start to dig they clam up, run or if cornered flat out lie and pull out the race card. I will give them credit for sticking together and helping their own, to a point. I think whites would do more of this for each other, but for now the Marxists have the upper hand in making sure whites do not organize or help each other, making sure to call them racist at every turn. The only good thing is that charge is starting to lose its power on the streets. The real racists are the Marxist elites as we can now all see, and the arrogant non-whites who are self-deceptive when it comes to seeing or admitting a lot of their success or even existence is at the expense of whites who foot the bill. </p>

		<p>These Asians have some nerve. They don&rsquo;t love this country and think they can come in and totally alter communities that were once White. I believe Asians to be a big threat. <br>

You have clearly forgotten about the American military stationed in South Korea. According to China and the DPRK, America has no business being there and stalemating the war. The hypocrisy on your part is blinding. Unless I&rsquo;m missing something&hellip;do you LOVE South Korea? What about the American forces in Japan, around Taiwan and in the Philippines? Either get out of Asian lands now or eat your words. </p>

		<p>What the Korean Doctor failed to mention is that her parents probably paid no taxes whatsoever during all those years they spent working their way up to 6 million dollars. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic asian way of making money.  Did they pay sales tax on the items sold in their first store?  Did they buy food stamps for 40 cents on the dollar and redeem them for $1.00 on the dollar?  Did they even bother to renew their business license every year? Did they pay corporate or business income tax?  Did they pay personal income tax?</p>
<p>Probably not.  The fact that they were able to save so much proves that they did not pay taxes. In fact, the amount of the savings is probably equal to the amount of the taxes the family evaded over the years.</p>
<p>The above mentioned tax and food stamp fraud dodges explain how so many asian immigrants are able to become millionaires 15 years after arriving with nothing.  These practices are standard operating procedure in asian businesses.  There are other more unsavory practices as well, such as human traficking, slave labor etc.</p>
<p>So many people ask why oh why do asians and middle easterners buy convenience stores in crime ridden black and hispanic neighborhoods?  Don&rsquo;t they know how dangerous it is?</p>
<p>Answer:  They do know how dangerous it is.  But they also know how lucrative the food stamp racket is.  Buy food stamps for 40 cents and redeem them for $1.00.  Of course now days they have to fill a basket with food, ring it up  and run the food stamp card through the machine.  But the scam still goes on.  The EBT electronic benefit card was supposed to stop the fraud, but it hasn&rsquo;t.  Sure it&rsquo;s a bit more trouble to run a basket fo food through the cash register but the fraud goes on.</p>
<p>A few years ago there was a Russian immigrant Doctor who set up a clinic and managed to defraud medicare of 2 billion dollars in 3 years.  He could barely speak or read English.  Since only those with a good command of English can pass the state physician exam, one can only assume he hired one of the numerous immigrants who work as professional test takers to take his physician qualifying exam.</p>
<p>S. California is the business fraud and tax evasion capitol of the United States due entirely to immigrants engaging in tax evasion, medicare fraud and every other scam they can think of.</p>
<p>She also failed to mention that although she was well qualified to be admitted to a UCLA and medical school, so was every white and asian who applied. The blacks and hispanics of course did not meet the qualifications but were admitted on the basis of affirmative action.</p>
<p>But asians are admitted by affirmative action when competing with whites.  Affirmative action admissions go blacks first, then hispanics, then asians, then middle eastern whites, then american whites.  Given the choice between a superbly qualified white male and a lesser qualified asian female, medical school admission will always go to the lesser qualified asian female.</p>
<p>There is also the question of living in a crowded slum for 20 years.  My Father was an ordinary factory worker.  Because of high wages for the average working class man and inexpensive housing he was able to support a non working wife and 5 children in a 4 bedroom house in a very nice suburb for many years.  When the oldest child was 12 my Mother went back to work as a teacher and was able to provide many anemities such as new rather than used bikes and decent cars rather than junkers.</p>
<p>But this was in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Nowdays an ordinary factory worker with a non working wife and 5 children would be dependent on food stamps, free school lunches, medicare, and public housing just to feed and shelter his family. Such a family would probably get some additional welfare cash income as well.</p>
<p>Those of us who live in California are all too familiar with the asian way of success.  It is called white collar crime and tax evasion.</p>

		<p>I believe I have posted this before.  It is the most brazen asian fraud I have ever personally encountered.</p>
<p>Those who think asians are so wonderful because some asians have high IQs and their criminal activities don&rsquo;t include knocking down elderly white women in the course of purse snatches need to be aware of certain aspects of asian culture such as the following.</p>
<p>I was at a Kinko&rsquo;s copy center on a crowded Sunday afternoon. I gave them a big job.  The clerk told me it would be at least an hour, did I want to come back or wait.  That Kinko&rsquo;s has comfortable chairs, free coffee and newspapers.  So I sat down to wait.</p>
<p>Soon a middle aged Chinese woman asked me &#8221; Are you a native speaker?&#8221;  This means a request to translate.  I get this request often and I usually translate.  The woman said she spoke good English (she did) but could barely read it.  She was plaintiff in a lawsuit.  She asked me to read it for her.  She handed me 3 lawsuits.</p>
<p>I started reading.  After about 20 minutes I realized what she and her family had done.  </p>
<p>In California it is possible to buy real estate with collateral instead of a cash down payment.  Usually the collateral is a mortgage on a piece of already owned real estate.</p>
<p>Say you own real estate worth $300,000. You owe only $100,000 on it.  So you have $200,000 equity.  You can buy another piece of real estate with a $200,000 mortgage, officially called a Deed of Trust on that real estate as the down payment.</p>
<p>The documents can only be issued by what is called a Trust Company.  This ensures that the real estate actually exists, that you own it and that you have the amount of equity in it that you claim.  Once the ducuments are issued they are legal documents and must be accepted everywhere.  </p>
<p>This woman bought an apartment house using as down payment a Deed of Trust on property she already owned.  A year later she bought another apartment house using another Deed of Trust.  All well and fine.  </p>
<p>Then she continued collecting rents but stopped paying the mortgage.  When the bank, Glendale Federal Savings started foreclosure she &#8220;gave as a family gift&#8221; the buildings to her brothers.  What the family did not realize is that the mortgage is not a personal debt but a debt on the building.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter who owns the building.  Glendale Federal did forclose.  In the process they throughly investigated this wonderful hard working entreprenurial Chinese family.</p>
<p>Turns out that the Deeds of Trust used to buy the apartment houses were frauds.  The Title and Trust company that issued the Deeds of Trust was owned by the woman&rsquo;s brothers.  The Trust company had issued thousands of Deeds of Trust on non existent real estate. The asians who bought the phony Deeds of Trust used them as down payments on property they bought.</p>
<p>This is really an astonishing, crafty, well thought out fraud.  They set up a Title and Trust company that issued real Deeds of Trust used as down payments for real estate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why real estate is so expensive in California.  One of the things I have noticed about immigrant fraud is that they come to this country intending to engage in these frauds.  They know all the tricks and angles in advance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as though they are honest businessmen who get caught short and cheat on taxes or don&rsquo;t send in all the quarterly withholding taxes.  To be able to get away with cheating and fraud is why they come to America.</p>
<p>The reason all asian countries except for Japan are so disfunctional, corrupt and poverty stricken is that a culture where every lies, cheats and steals cannot function.  Those who cheat and steal better than the rest succeed.  The rest fall into poverty.  Everything depends on bribes, connections, extortion, and conniving.  Such societies are disfunctional.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the entire world wants to immigrate to the United States.  Our society is honest and functional.  An honest person can still survive here.  But not for long.  As more and more the norm becomes cheating, corruption and fraud we will become what asia, africa, the middle east and S. america are now, corrupt, disfunctional third world dumps.</p>
<p>We have enough crooked businessmen, con artists and white collar criminals of our own.  We don&rsquo;t need to import them from every corrupt country in the world.</p>

		<p>Kevka, the S. Koreans, Japanese, Phillipinos and other Asian countries would now be colonies of formerly communist now cannibal capitalist China were it not for the American troops.</p>
<p>I agree that the 50 year American occupation has turned these countries into quasi colonies.  There are problems.  But what was the alternative?  Remember that between 1948 and 1970 the Chinese communists massacred more than 100 million Chinese.  There was a continous famine from 1950 to about 1975.  Mao used the famines to kill his people and control them. He also outright murdered millions.  </p>
<p>During the &#8220;great leap forward&#8221; Mao decreed that China, which had no steel mills at all would become the foremost steel producer in the world.  To provide fuel for the backyard steel mills, he ordered most of the trees in N. China cut down.  </p>
<p>N. China is basically a desert.  With most of the trees cut down the desert became drier and expanded.  100 years ago the Gobi desert was hundreds of miles from Beijing.</p>
<p>After Mao ordered all the trees cut down, the Gobi desert expanded.  Now the edge of the Gobi desert is only 50 miles from Beijing.  Monstrous sand dunes more than 100 feet high are rolling to China&rsquo;s capital, due to Mao&rsquo;s ordering most of the trees in N. China cut down in his ridiculous attempts to manufacture steel in backyard furnaces.</p>
<p>So which colonial power was better for S. Korea, Japan and other asian countries?  America?  Or Mao&rsquo;s China?</p>
<p>Which section of Korea would you rather live in?  The S. Korea that the American army has protected for 60 years?  Or the famine ridden dictatorship of N. Korea?</p>

		<p>The remarks on Medical School Admittance are true, and in fact true for all undergrad and graduate programs in CA and probably the US. Whites are pushed to the back of line at UCLA and UC Berkeley as far as it goes for undergraduate admissions. We hear Asians cry about not being admitted, etc, but they are only comparing Asians to&hellip;other Asians, then black and latinos. Asians always get the nod over whites. It&rsquo;s even worse in graduate programs, and not by accident of course. It is almost impossible to get into the top UC Grad schools, especially medical schools, if you are a non-hispanic / non-Middle Eastern white. It seems as if the powers that be are determined to keep white males of this type at 10% or lower of the student body. Then when it&rsquo;s time to present numbers, the hispanic whites and Middle Eastern whites are counted as &#8220;white&#8221; to give the public a certain impression. It&rsquo;s horrible and frightening. </p>
