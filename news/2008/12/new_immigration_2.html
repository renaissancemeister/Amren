			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Urmee Khan, Telegraph (London), December 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The new policy will only reduce population growth by 2.5 per cent, according to a report by the House of Commons library, an independent research facility for MPs.</p>
<p>It says the new system will only reduce the estimated population growth of ten million by as little as 250,000 over the next two decades.</p>
<p>This will leaving the population figure still around 70,750,000 by 2031.</p>
<p>Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, claims the points-based system will control the numbers of non-EU migrant workers and stop the UK population, which is currently 61million, to reach the 70 million mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;The points based system is the biggest shake-up in immigration for 50 years,&#8221; he said last month.</p>
<p>Under the points based system, introduced in November, highly skilled non EU workers need 75 points to enter the UK (tier 1). Skilled workers in a &lsquo;shortage area&rsquo;, like a nurse, need 50 points and can only stay for duration of contract and bring partner and children (tier 2).</p>
<p>Those who are low skilled, do not need any points and can only stay one year (tier 3).</p>
<p>The House of Commons library however, has produced a detailed analysis on what the impact of the points-based system.</p>
<p>It found an important part of the system, tier 2, which forces migrants to prove they have skills not already available within Britain and the EU, would lead to only 10,500 fewer people entering the UK each year.</p>
<p>The House of Commons library said it put the number migrating to the UK under the work permit scheme at 88,000 a year.</p>
<p>The research paper states: &#8220;A 12 per cent reduction would be the equivalent of 10,560 individuals, leaving a net total of approximately 77,500 people entering under tier 2.&#8221;</p>
<p>It continues: &lsquo;On this basis, the population by 2031 may be approximately 250,000 less than current ONS estimates, meaning that the overall population of 70million would still be reached by 2031.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve said: &#8220;This proves what we have been saying, that a points system without a limit is pointless. Labour should answer our call to introduce an annual limit on non-EU immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mr Woolas disputed the figures.</p>
<p>He told the Daily Mail: &#8220;These projections are not accurate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Government can use the power and flexibility of the points system to manage numbers coming here, taking into account the needs of the labour market and the country as a whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Government is also breaking the link between temporary stay in the UK and settlement, whereas these figures include all people in the country, including temporary migrants.&#8221;<br>

		<p>When oh, when are westerners going to learn, that the elites who run their nations, DON&rsquo;T WANT IMMIGRATION SYSTEMS THAT WORK? It&rsquo;s ridiculous to believe that immigration, whether legal or illegal can&rsquo;t be stopped. Yet, this is what the politicians and business leaders will argue endlessly. Here is a thought experiment. Imagine those same leaders having to decide on effective immigration enforcement if their lives depended on it. It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine how quickly they&rsquo;d become experts on the subject.</p>

		<p>There are no sadder stories in modern history than that of the loss of Briton.<br>
Once she was all powerful. What she didn&rsquo;t lose, she gave away.</p>
<p>Now, as the curtains open to reveal the last scene, she surrenders to the plot.</p>

		<p>The powers that be spoke in a similar way about the border fence between the US and Mexico saying it would not stop illegal immigration. However a recent article in USA Today related that apprehensions of illegal immigrants has fallen from 1.6 million in 2004 to 700,000 in 2008. </p>
<p>A points system would obviously complement strong border security, where the government ensured the immigrants came into a host country with something to offer apart from demands that their human rights be respected, and that they be rewarded for having been born in a poor country where their human rights are not respected. </p>
<p>But in Australia where we do have a points system, trade with China or Korea is still a big factor rather than the capacities of migrants from these countries. Many of them are graduates from Australian universities with qualifications that have been diluted in value in order to improve the pass rate. As a result you see many Asian accountant graduates working as bank tellers. The government is also trying to bring in Polynesians to pick fruit. These people have very high rates of incarceration and welfare dependence once they arrive. It would probably be cheaper for the country to invest in fruit-picking machinery provided to farmers tax-free and with some other discount. </p>
<p>My point is that even when governments use points systems for migrants, they still find ways round it to suit some political agenda they don&rsquo;t want known, though often dressed up as humanitarianism.</p>

		<p>One very frightening statistic that is completely ignored by Britain&rsquo;s politicians and media is the fact that the number of households projected to be on the waiting list for public housing will soar past 5 million in a few years time.<br>
  Considering that there are only around 20 million households in Britain this is a most alarming prospect - (It is exceedingly likely that the imbalance caused by Britain&rsquo;s chronic accomodation shortage is at the root of its current economic catastrophe - only Britain&rsquo;s &#8216;clever&rsquo; politicians and economists for some reason can&rsquo;t see this, if there was no immigration into Britain there would be no housing crisis, since the indigenous population has declined every year since 1976 - FACT).<br>
    Contrary to popular belief, the majority of people applying for public housing are very decent people who for one reason or another do not have the financial wherewithal demanded by the private sector.I fear Britain has the a makings of a disaster here - but if the BNP played their cards right, this is the most gold-plated excellent political opportunity.<br>
 BNP activists must stress at every availablr opportunity the fact that native Britons are living in nmiserable accomodation is solely and entirely due to the massive, uncontrolled &#8216;open-door&rsquo; immigration that was deliberately engedered by the wretched New Labour government that promised so much but only brought economic ruin.<br>
  As I write Sterling has plummetted to unprecedented lows on thw world&rsquo;s money markets - and the prospects for the economy are, literally, hopeless.<br>
  Britons - I implore you in this short posting know who thine enemy is and make sure you vote BNP at every available election - the lives of your grandchildren depend on it, this is a climactic moment.<br>

		<p>Point systems-how insulting! Down to point systems at companies, employees find a way around them to be late, miss work, to not be a good employee(citizen), etc. </p>
<p>Just more impersonal mumbo jumbo so as not to know how to get down to the real issue. It&rsquo;s easier not to care. It&rsquo;s easier not to know of one&rsquo;s environment. But, it certainly pisses off those who do care and who do know.  </p>

		<p>There is in the final analysis, no such thing as an immigration system that works. It will inevitably have loopholes that will let into it peoples whose main contribution to that nation&rsquo;s life will be to swell its wefare rolls and jail population. That&rsquo;s a given for any nation where newcomers enter with the blessing of government and the funding of taxpayers.<br>
With world economies tanking, there may just be, finally, a reconsideration of open borders in Western countries to Third World immigration. It may be a small step in reserving a shrinking job market to those nation&rsquo;s own population, but it&rsquo;s still a step. <br>

		<p>Australia had a point system for admitting immigrants when I moved there in 1998.  It worked.  They&rsquo;ve probably done away with it since then.</p>

		<p>The Disunited Kingdom has now become so liberal in its outlook that I don&rsquo;t think that the outgoing government cares a fig what happens.<br>
If it hit the headlines that Osama Bin Laden was alive and well, living in Bradford in a council house with three wives and ten children, all paid for by the state plus police protection, I would not be at all surprised.<br>
The idiocy continues ad nauseum - Guantanomo aliens are now destined for early retirement in  Britain and, by the look of things, we are moving our under-equipped troops into Palestine.<br>
Oh joy, and all this in the middle of a full-blown depression.<br>
Pass the vodka. </p>
