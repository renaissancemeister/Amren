<h1>The Color Bind</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Terry Teachout, Wall Street Journal, December 20, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Twenty-one years after it was first seen on Broadway, &#8220;Joe Turner&rsquo;s Come and Gone,&#8221; the second installment in August Wilson&rsquo;s 10-play chronicle of black life in 20th-century America, will be returning to the Great White Way in April in a production directed by Bartlett Sher. That&rsquo;s good news for serious theatergoers. Yet Lincoln Center Theater&rsquo;s production of &#8220;Joe Turner&#8221; is already raising a ruckus of the wrong sort. Marion McClinton, a black director who has staged two Wilson plays on Broadway, recently told a reporter for the St. Paul Pioneer Press that the decision to hire Mr. Sher, who is white, was &#8220;straight-up institutional racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meaning &hellip; what? I&rsquo;m not quite sure, and neither, I suspect, is Mr. McClinton. &#8220;I am not saying a white director cannot direct a black play,&#8221; he added. &#8220;What I am saying is, are they coming at it with the same respect and diligence of study as they do O&rsquo;Neill, Brecht, Chekhov?&#8221; Is he suggesting, then, that Mr. Sher, who is one of America&rsquo;s most admired and accomplished stage directors, would fail to do exactly that? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>

		<p>This article is absolutely correct&hellip;.and the obverse is absolutely correct too&hellip;..ONLY white people can make a play dealing with the white experience.</p>
<p>But before you go too far with August Wilson, it should be mentioned that August Wilson was born Fredrick August Kittel, the son of a German immigrant baker. Yes, the great &#8220;African American playwright&#8221; was half-white, attended an all-white catholic school in the 1950s, and grew up in the Hill District of Pittsburg, an overwhelmingly white working class neighborhood.</p>
<p>No wonder he knows so much about the &#8220;African American experience in the 20th century&#8221;. His mammy musta told him all about it.</p>
<p>No wonder they had Bartlet Sher direct the play. (Is this a German sur name? No doubt his daddy would be proud.)</p>

It&rsquo;s not enough that they demand we re-stage our plays in their image. Funny how only blacks can relate to black issues and whites are expected to step aside but our plays, movies, and comic book characters can be transformed at their whim. Can I get to see A Midsummers Night Dream with an all white cast?</p>
<p>Remember the <b>Black Golden Rule</b>: That which is black must remain black. That which is white must be made black.<br>

		<p>I have no problem with a black directing a black play as long as blacks have no problem with a white directing a white-founded and majority-white country. The problem is, blacks always want to have it both ways&hellip;all-black for them, but integrated for the rest of us.</p>

		<p>This from the original article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;When I first started writing plays,&#8221; he once said, &#8220;I couldn&rsquo;t write good dialogue because I didn&rsquo;t respect how black people talked. I thought that in order to make art out of their dialogue I had to change it, make it into something different. Once I learned to value and respect my characters, I could really hear them.&#8221; That&rsquo;s why his dialogue sounds so poetic in the mouths of so many black actors: It&rsquo;s second nature to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see the same respect paid to how Southerners talk - that is to say, before Southern English disappears as a result of constant negative bombardment by the MSM.</p>

<p>There is no black work of literature worthy of the same respect and study as plays by O&rsquo;Neill, Brecht or Chekhov, or one that requires as much study. August Wilson may be a marginally better playwright than, say, Imamu Amiri Baraka, but that&rsquo;s as far as anyone but a fool would go. Why any white person want to be involved with this dreck is beyond me.</p>

<p>Of course, they aren&rsquo;t.  Blacks have never been capable of producing high art in the tradition of O&rsquo;Neill and Chekov.  Blacks should be happy that there have been so many Socialists in the Theater over the years to promote undeserving Black writers and convince White audiences that they are paying to see something worthwhile.</p>

		<p>Might it not be true that a white Jewish director would be someone more likely to have considerable experience in theatre and stage productions? So what?  You hire the person with the best experience and qualifications, someone who can do the best job for you.  You go where the experience is.  If I were starting a Chinese restaurant, I might be more likely to hire Chinese cooks   &mdash;   but not out of any intention of racial discrimination.</p>

		<p>I guess they don&rsquo;t like &#8216;diversity&rsquo; when it comes to them. Too bad it rarely ever does. </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t remember if the cast was all white, but Peter Hall&rsquo;s cheesy production (1968) of &#8220;A Midsummer&rsquo;s Night Dream&#8221; with Helen Mirren and Diana Rigg was quite nice.</p>

<p><br>
This reminded me of recently reading that Jamie Foxx wants to be the first black actor to play James Bond. Perhaps Brad Pitt should look into playing Martin Luther King? Didn&rsquo;t Al Jolson, an American Jew, make a successful career playing black characters? </p></p>
