			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Zimbabwean, December 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The international rift over how to deal with Zimbabwe widened yesterday after the African Union rejected proposals for tougher action against the regime even as President Bush joined calls for Robert Mugabe to step down. &#8220;It is time for Robert Mugabe to go,&#8221; Mr Bush said in Washington. &#8220;Across the continent, African voices are bravely speaking out to say, &lsquo;Now is the time for him to step down&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the African Union made clear that it would support a resolution only through talks. &#8220;Only dialogue between the Zimbabwean parties, supported by the AU and other regional actors, can restore peace and stability to that country,&#8221; a spokesman for President Kikwete of Tanzania, the AU chairman, said.</p>
<p>South Africa also maintained that the answer for Zimbabwe was power sharing. &#8220;There should be no political point-scoring and games played when what is really needed right now is support,&#8221; Ayanda Ntsaluba, a South African Foreign Ministry official, said. He added that Zimbabwean leaders needed to work across the political divide to solve the country&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>Sending peacekeeping troops or removing Mr Mugabe by force, as proposed by figures including Raila Odinga, the Kenyan Prime Minister, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, were simply not options, he added.</p>
<p>Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s spokesman accused the West of using the cholera outbreak to try to bring down the President. &#8220;We won this country through the barrel of the gun and we will defend it the way we won it,&#8221; George Charamba said.</p>
<p>The international discord is nevertheless lacking one voice &mdash; that of US president elect Barack Obama, who has not last commented about the humanitarian disaster in Zimbabwe five months ago.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the President-elect&rsquo;s transition team indicated yesterday that she would be willing to issue a statement on his behalf.</p>
<p>Although Mr Obama has been keen to avoid second-guessing the White House on foreign policy issues and emphasised that there can only be &#8220;one president at a time&#8221;, this does not explain a prolonged period of silence that now stretches back to June 24.</p>
<p>This apparent reluctance to join the fray is matched by that of Hillary Clinton, his nomination for Secretary of State. This week her Senate office referred requests for a comment on the subject to a statement made on June 23.</p>
<p>Expectations for America&rsquo;s first black president are high in Africa. Not only was his father from Kenya, where much of his extended family still live, but he also visited the continent three years ago, when he took courageous stances criticising South Africa&rsquo;s record on HIV/Aids and its quiet diplomacy towards Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Mr Obama&rsquo;s election last month was greeted warmly by Zimbabwe&rsquo;s opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who said that his fellow citizens would &#8220;appreciate the true value of a vote, the preciousness of a poll that is conducted openly and fairly, and a result that is respected by all&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Mugabe offered his own congratulations, adding: &#8220;Those of us in developing countries cherish the hope of working with your administration as we pursue our programmes and policies to develop our societies.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one is suggesting that the President-elect is likely to take him up on this offer. Mr Obama&rsquo;s June statement made plain his view that the Zimbabwean Government is illegitimate.</p>
<p>He said that unless fresh elections were held, the US and other countries should tighten &#8220;targeted sanctions&#8221; and &#8220;pursue an enforceable, negotiated political transition in Zimbabwe that would end repressive rule&#8221;.</p>
<p>Most observers expect there to be little change in the policy pursued by Mr Bush&rsquo;s Administration, which has largely taken its lead from Britain, where a colonial past and family ties ensure that Zimbabwe receives more attention than elsewhere in the West.</p>
<p>Mark Bellamy, a former US Ambassador to Kenya, said: &#8220;There has been an assumption that Obama will be more engaged with Africa. This is not necessarily the case. He has a lot of other issues on his plate and even in Africa I don&rsquo;t think Zimbabwe will be top of the agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan Rice, Mr Obama&rsquo;s foreign policy adviser nominated for the post of UN ambassador, has stated that one of her goals will be to prevent future genocides.</p>
<p>*Lord Malloch-Brown, the Africa Minister, will travel to South Africa tomorrow for talks on the cholera crisis, a spokesman said yesterday.<br>

</i><p>Uh, no.  You won that country through capitulation of the whites through the Lancaster House Agreement.  And they were only induced to capitulate and to stay in &#8220;Zimbabwe,&#8221; by Mugabe&rsquo;s assurances to their leader the late Ian Smith that he and his party ZANU would strictly abide by the Agreement and that changes in Zimbabwe would be made gradually and by proper legal process.<p>If only white people would realize that they may only rely on the barrel of a gun for their own safety and preservation, and never on the oily, deceitful promises of their nonwhite antagonists&hellip; </p></p></p>

		<p>     Time alone will solve the problem - time for all of them to starve to death or to die of cholera. Wait until the disease spreads to other nations. I wonder how many of these refugees we will let into our country.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mugabe spokesman: &ldquo;We won this country through the barrel of the gun and we will defend it the way we won it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You won the country because spinless, left-wing elements gave it to you, old hoss.  If you had continued fighting you would have been exterminated to the last retard, and Rhodesia would be prospering today.</p>
<p>The left wing crazies caused many whites their lives and properties, but they are going to be responsible for black genocide on a huge scale, which is an unintended consequence.</p>

		<p>The ethical standards of Africa are not the same as our own. We should not play world police nor should we try to protect these people from their own amoral behavior. Let Africa be Africa. It&rsquo;s not our problem.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the most irritating feature amongst blacks is their ego and how eagerly they love to stroke it at any given time, perhaps a throw back to their tribal ways. But they seem to love taking things out of context to suit them, and especially pervert reality so that they seem in some way extraordinary.</p>
<p><br>
Like this for example, don&rsquo;t i recall whites basically handing things over to them? and not exactly by the barrel of a gun? but by the barrel of their own bleeding heart ways? The only guns if i remember, came afterward, when the whites, now out of power, were then slaughtered at gun point in a very genocidal way. Not quite honorable to convince a man to hand over the reins then shoot him. Not quite a conquest either.</p>
<p>They seem to think they were great warriors lol. Just like they think they are able to stand up on their own two feet and don&rsquo;t need support by people of light (asians and whites, being china is their new go-to apparently). Just like how mugabe is a great man, and the white man created aids. And everything is controlled by &#8220;the man&#8221;. cant forget that one.</p>
<p>Inside many of their minds is a deep seeded fantasy about themselves and the world around them, one our inane liberal white brethren have greatly helped to foster within their minds. Its a sad state of affairs indeed. The only true reason this childish state of mind persists, is that the liberals keep it going. Endless amounts of ego boosts to a people who love their ego, goes a long way.</p>
<p>It will not stop until the white liberals are stopped. That much i guarantee </p>

While they can live under white rule, they choose to die under black rule.</p>
<p>The fact is can&rsquo;t you help a people who won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t help themselves. </p>
<p>The only solution to Africa is to erect a 40ft wall around the continent with signs reading <b>ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK.</b><br>

		<p>The basis of african reluctance to critisize mugabe is that every single other black president/general/king/leader has already adopted identical policies or, in the case of RSA, is planning to do it. China is now taking minerals out of black africa in exchange for plastic buckets and states &#8216;we do not get involved in local politics&rsquo; when western aid is made conditional on an anti-corruption policies. The west is groaning under a terrible fiscal load and can quite easily stop all further monetary aid to africa without any noticable difference to the black african population. The black african leaders have already stashed away all previous cash &#8216;aid&rsquo; donations and will aso steal any further funding. Mugabe proves beyond all doubt that black african leaders have absolutely no interest in black africans and simply hang on to power to strip everything that they and their clan can stuff into the &#8216;national carrier&rsquo; and fly off to safe white destinations and live off their secret bank accounts for as long as the loot lasts. Just leave black africa to rot but give as much assistance as possible to White farmers and businessmen as they make far better refugees and asylum seekers than any somali pirate. Perhaps pangas will eventually be used against these corrupt governments instead of against women and children collecting firewood and water. </p>

		<p>There won through the barrel of a gun? Do they really think the Brits couldnt have kept it? <br>
Besides where are all the blacks and liberals to jump on thie comment since they always accuse the whiteman of by killing off the indians to steal their land? <br>
So its ok for blacks to do it but not whites? What ignorant feces they are. All nations in existence were won by conquering others including every single African nation in tribal warfare. </p>
<p>The problem comes when we see that blacks are incompetent corrupt inept rulers of their own destiny and inevitably the end result is sub 3rd world poverty disease starvation tyranny rule but you are not supposed to notice this or comment about it.</p>
