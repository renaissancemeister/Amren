			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>PRNewswire-USNewswire, December 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Asian Americans are less attached to their racial identity than black Americans. This finding confirms that minority politics in the United States today is more complex than generally realized and that understanding the increasingly multicultural nature of the U.S. requires perspectives that incorporate, but go beyond, the black historical experience.</p>
<p>The study which led this finding was conducted by political scientists Jane Junn (Rutgers University) and Natalie Masuoka (Tufts University). It is entitled &#8220;Asian American Identity: Shared Racial Status and Political Context,&#8221; and appears in the December issue of Perspectives on Politics, a journal of the American Political Science Association (APSA).</p>
<p>Asian Americans exhibit relatively high levels of economic and residential integration with mainstream white America, leading to predictions that they are assimilating more rapidly than black Americans and other minority or immigrant groups. They are also among the fastest growing minorities in the United States, having grown from less than 1 million people in 1960 to 14 million today. In political terms this growth has made Asian Americans a decisive swing vote in states such as California, New York, and Washington. Yet, despite their differences with black Americans, Asian Americans do exhibit racial consciousness in politics.</p>
<p>The study explores this phenomenon. It employs data drawn from the 2004 Ethnic Politics Survey, which included comparison groups of 354 Asian and 416 black Americans. The survey further divided the respondents into two groups, one of which was exposed to questions crafted to accentuate racial identification and measure the resulting sense of group identity. The outcome was that while the overall proportion of Asian Americans who say race is important in their racial consciousness is smaller than for blacks, in the experiment &#8220;Asian Americans showed strong results from the experimental manipulation, demonstrating substantial malleability.&#8221;</p>
<p>In their analysis, the authors identify three factors that drive Asian American group identity: state-sponsored racial classification, immigration policy, and racial stereotypes. They then assess how these factors structure the ways in which Asian Americans identify with their group: &#8220;We argue that racial identity for Asian Americans exists as a more latent identity compared to blacks, and we find Asian American group racial consciousness much more susceptible to the surrounding context,&#8221; state the authors. &#8220;In the multi-racial U.S. polity today,&#8221; they conclude, &#8220;we now have the opportunity to consider racial dynamics beyond the binary of black and white.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Despite a level of superficial assimilation, Asians have a lot more racial awareness then many realize. They are just a lot more subtle about it. </p>

		<p>Why do academics spend so much time and money researching the obvious? As a matter of IQ and cultural attitudes Asians are the most similar to whites. Smart people who work and pay their bills will naturally be more accepted by whites than ignorant people so steal and live off of welfare. Whether they belong here en masse when they have their own exclusive nations across the Pacific is another matter. The left simply views Asians as another part of their anti-white coalition.</p>

		<p>Asians are, I believe, quite a bit more similar genetically to whites than blacks.  The evolutionary distance between the white and yellow races is bridgeable to some degree, whereas half a millenium of the &#8220;troublesome presence&#8221; on these shores should be long enough to prove the impossibility of assimilating or even reasonably integrating black Africans to Western civilization in general and our American nation in particular.</p>

		<p>Blacks never did assimilate, did they?  That&rsquo;s sort of the bottom line after 300 years in America, and 145 years after slavery  &mdash;  they never made an effort to fit in.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Asian&#8221; is a bit too broad a category, but, in general, unlike mexicans, they come to this country to be part of it, and to improve themselves and their families.   They have a set of values that, at least as far as work ethic and education are concerned, are compatible with non-marxist Whites.  Asian women of all nationalities find greater freedom here.  It is not uncommon for them to marry outside their race because White men treat them better, and White men find them more feminine than marxist schooled White women.</p>
<p>Blacks are unassimilated by their own incompetence, and mestizos simply don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>White marxists will gladly take the money from hard working Asian parents, and then try to deassimilate their children.  I don&rsquo;t think this will be very successful, as deassimilated Asians will not find common cause with Asian of different nationalities, and resent being part of any coalition with blacks and mestizos, whom they believe, regardless of exhortations of their prospective marxist masters, are inferior.</p>

		<p>Racial Intermarriage statistics illustrate the compatibility of Whites and Asians.  There are far more of these marriages than White and Black, or Asian and Black marriages.  And the fact that there are statistically insignificant White men marrying Black women, or Asian men marrying Black women, reinforces the findings of this study on the disparity of Asian and Black integration.</p>

		<p>I find it fascinating how the puppetmasters have duped Whites into accepting Asians into our societies, simply on the basis that Asians are somehow preferable to blacks.  The comments frequently found on this board reflect this phenomenon.  In fact, most Asians are not &#8220;quite a bit more similar genetically to whites than blacks,&#8221; as has been suggested.  The &#8220;best&#8221; Asians, as it were, are the Japanese, and they, by and large, do not emigrate to the United States.  (The few that do set up Japanese schools to keep their children from adopting &#8220;American&#8221; habits.)  </p>
<p>The Asians that bless us with their vibrant diversity, in increasing numbers, are Koreans, Thais, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Hmong, Laotians, etc., all of which are on the same basic level, culturally, with mestizos.  Asians are wonderful&hellip;.in Asia, and they should stay there.  </p>

<p>They all come here to make money. Most places in the world have as much freedom as the USA. They&rsquo;re here to take advantage of the white man. I would have to agree that Asians have a fair amount of &#8216;racial consciousness&rsquo; too. There&rsquo;s been a constant movement to instill this from the media, educators, and government. Constant racial consciousness and delineation. At least, for everyone who&rsquo;s not a white heterosexual male. Where everyone else does it, it&rsquo;s promoted and paid for. Considered the highest enlightenment. When white men do the same thing, never mind that everyone else has been doing it in fullforce for quite some time&hellip; when white men do it too it&rsquo;s considered hate and prosecuted.   </p>

		<p>What a shocker!  People with the same or higher average IQs than whites assimilate more successfully than people with IQs 15-20 points lower than whites.  This phenomenon certainly deserves a lot more study to ferret out the root causes of this seemingly inexplicable disparity in assimilation rates between blacks and Asians.</p>

		<p>The only reason Asians seem to assimilate more is because they are encouraged to do so if they want to make money in America. Asians and Arabs are pushed to open businesses in the Black community.  In my travels across America, the only Asian business I see in a White community is an Asian restaurant and maybe a nail salon. There are throngs of Asian businesses in Black communities and more interaction and familiarity among the two groups.  If Asians have successfully assimilated into White society why is it that Asians have not been allowed to open their nail salons, cleaners, beauty supply stores, restaurants, liquor stores in YOUR white communities?   </p>

		<p>Against my better judgment, I will say that Jupiter - I mean Legal Eagle&rsquo;s post is mostly correct, with one glaring error.  Koreans are far more similar the Japanese (both genetically and culturally) and should not be lumped in with those other Asians mentioned.  South Korea has done a great job catching up to the Japanese economically and technologically, and it&rsquo;s all due to the nature of its people.  After all, South Korea does have the highest IQ in the world.</p>

		<p>Legal Eagle,<br>
I don&rsquo;t know why you are singling out the Japanese since E. Asians are Japanese, Korean, and Han Chinese. Japan is being rapidly overtaken by China and Korea economically since Japan had a head start during their war and colonization of Korea and aggression into China. </p>
<p>In my experience, Japanese, Koreans, and educated Chinese are pretty easy population to assimilate into white society. They are proven to be smart, enterprising, hard working, and less criminal even than whites. They are also light skinned. Again, it is a matter of numbers,not too many and they would be a good admixture for our population. SE Asians have nothing to offer us; economically, technologically, or pure brain power. They are best kept out in all cases just as with other 3rd world undesireables. We don&rsquo;t need to take in any Indians, the Brits have taken all of them. Sad!</p>

		<p>I have had sufficient professional experience with Koreans to support my comments.  Koreans - like certain other races - are driven by emotion to a far greater degree than the Japanese, who tend to be more stoic.  As for the comment about how similar Koreans are to the Japanese, it must be noted that the Japanese government will not even allow Koreans to become citizens.  A Japanese minister was once asked why Koreans cannot become Japanese citizens, and his response was: &#8220;Because they are Korean.&#8221;  A beautifully simple and proper, common-sense response.</p>
<p>I have commented extensively here about the various ways Koreans are able to &#8220;work the system&#8221; in America to gain termendous wealth without displaying any obvious business acumen (or contributing anything of value to our society). Another comment to this story mentioned the ubiquitous Korean nail shops, which are found literally on every street corner in America.  Ask yourself this - Since shen has the nail-polishing business a millionaires&rsquo; game?  Do you ever see customers in these shops? Where does the money come from to allow these people to buy $500,000 homes and a Mercedes? I know, and I have explained it here before.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you mean about working the system? There are many Vietnamese, Vietnamese Chinese and some Chinese nail salons as well. I&rsquo;ve seen many very hard working Koreans running stores in various neighborhoods. They get hurt and shot by the black &#8216;clientele&rsquo; for their hard work.</p>
<p>I consider E. Asians to be E. Asians without much difference between them except for some economic differences due to history. I understand that genetically the Japanese and the Koreans are the most similar. There are certain cultural similarities as well and the Japanese tried to force Koreans to take on Japanese identity which Koreans resisted. I also understand that the Japanese Emperor is descended from ancient Koreans. I wouldn&rsquo;t take sides on any of their issue since they have vitriolic fights about their versions of history. </p>

<p>Legal Eagle sounds like a Marxist and a black. A white Right-winger (Nationalist, Conservative, or Libertarian) would never type such utter nonsense. The politics of envy is bitter, sick and sad. Whats more it illustrates a deep and innate sense of worthlessness and inferiority. We white Right-wing nationalists will have none of this Marxism on this board thankyou very much!<br>
