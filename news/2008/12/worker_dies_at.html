			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Gould, Clare Trapasso and Rich Schapiro, New York Daily News, November 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Wal-Mart worker died early Friday after an &#8220;out-of-control&#8221; mob of frenzied shoppers smashed through the Long Island store&rsquo;s front doors and trampled him, police said.</p>
<p>The Black Friday stampede plunged the Valley Stream outlet into chaos, knocking several employees to the ground and sending others scurrying atop vending machines to avoid the horde.</p>
<p>When the madness ended, 34-year-old Jdimytai Damour was dead and four shoppers, including a woman eight months pregnant, were injured.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Damour, a temporary maintenance worker from Jamaica, Queens, was gasping for air as shoppers continued to surge into the store after its 5 a.m. opening, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Even officers who arrived to perform CPR on the trampled worker were stepped on by wild-eyed shoppers streaming inside, a cop at the scene said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roughly 2,000 people gathered outside the Wal-Mart&rsquo;s doors in the predawn darkness.</p>
<p>Chanting &#8220;push the doors in,&#8221; the crowd pressed against the glass as the clock ticked down to the 5 a.m. opening.</p>
<p>Sensing catastrophe, nervous employees formed a human chain inside the entrance to slow down the mass of shoppers.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>The mob barreled in and overwhelmed workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were jumping over the barricades and breaking down the door,&#8221; said Pat Alexander, 53, of Crown Heights, Brooklyn. &#8220;Everyone was screaming. You just had to keep walking on your toes to keep from falling over.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the throng toppled Damour, his fellow employees had to fight through the crowd to help him, police said.</p>
<p>Witness Kimberly Cribbs said shoppers acted like &#8220;savages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When they were saying they had to leave, that an employee got killed, people were yelling, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been on line since Friday morning!&rsquo;&#8221; Cribbs said. &#8220;They kept shopping.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 28-year-old pregnant woman and three other shoppers were taken to area hospitals with minor injuries, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fleming [Nassau County police spokesman Lt. Michael Fleming] said criminal charges were possible but that it would be difficult to identify individual shoppers in surveillance videos.</p>
<p>Items on sale at the Wal-Mart store included a $798 Samsung 50-inch Plasma HDTV, a Bissel Compact Upright Vacuum for $28 and Men&rsquo;s Wrangler Tough Jeans for $8.</p>
<p>The Long Island store reopened at 1 p.m. and was packed within minutes.</p>

		<p>I had heard this story on the radio all week-end and just couldn&rsquo;t make sense of it. Not being familiar with the area it occured in, the image in my mind was a crowd of mostly White folk with a sprinkle of black, brown and yellow thrown in. I just couldn&rsquo;t work out how such a thing could happen.<br>
I just read the article here and when I got to the pictures at the bottom (first I&rsquo;ve seen) it all made sense. I should have known.<br>
Not that any of the &#8220;news&#8221; reports on the radio even came close to mentioning that the Mob was %99.9 BLACK! </p>

		<p>This craziness is the responsibility of both the store and the shoppers. The man was given no training in crowd control. Why did the store open at this ridiculous hour ? Did they hire police for crowd control ? Of course, most of the blame must fall on the shoppers. In an effort to save a few bucks they snuffed out a human life. Is this what we have turned Christ&rsquo;s birthday into ? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure Walmart executives are having second thoughts about opening a store in such a &#8220;diverse&#8221; area.<br>
Valley Stream was at one time a nice suburban community on the South Shore of Long Island. It&rsquo;s proximity to SE Queens and even Brooklyn as well as Freeport, Long Island has made the area very dangerous.</p>
<p>This whole episode brings up unsettling things. One, most obvious is that in our post-Obama world (and even before it) blacks folks have some disposable income. A trip to Atlantic City would also reveal this. Yet blacks continue to play the old woe is me black rage/white guilt rap. </p>
<p>Second, these brothers sure did not show each other much humanity. This perhaps reveals something about the content of their character. </p>

		<p>I have no idea why on earth they would let a howling violent mob of 2,000 angry blacks into the store. They should have gone to the sporting goods section and handed out shotguns to all the employees and fired off a few warning shots. I can&rsquo;t imagine how much looting and stealing must have occurred in the aftermath of all this insanity.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.  Before I knew any other details at all, upon hearing only that a worker at a Walmart was stampeded to death by a mob of shoppers and refused to leave even after finding out that the employee had been killed, I knew that they must have been black.  I take no satisfaction in having suspected this, but it is what it is. </p>
<p>Whites comprise the majority of consumers in this country, and by leaps and bounds the majority of &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; shoppers; but when was the last time you recall having heard of white shoppers acting so murderously, and then so callously when finding out that they had stampeded to death an innocent employee?</p>

		<p>When I first heard this I didn&rsquo;t believe it, and it&rsquo;s still hard to express in words how utterly sick and depraved this is. That a human being should be killed because a bunch of &#8220;shoppers&#8221; were so crazed with the thought of getting something on sale is beyond understanding. If it were up to me, I&rsquo;d track down and put everyone of the animals in the videos on trial for negligent homicide. Sick, sick, sick. I&rsquo;m ashamed to say I live in the same country. </p>

		<p>I wonder how many news stations used footage of the stampede, since it shows the race of the participants so clearly?</p>
<p>This reminds me of a news story a couple of years ago about a school that was either giving away its old Macintosh computers or selling them very cheaply. This caused fist fights among the crowd that was there to grab ahold of one or more computers. The event made news as a result of the wanton disregard for civility that the crowd displayed. Computer magazines interpreted this as a sign of the increasing popularity of the Macintosh. Not likely. A little investigation showed that the school was in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood &hellip; and the participants were most likely interested in the resale value of the machines. </p>

		<p>   From all the pictures I&rsquo;ve seen of this riot, it would appear that most, if not all the rioters were black. Imagine that!! It would seem that &#8220;black Friday&#8221; has taken on new meaning. From what I&rsquo;ve read, even the police and rescue people were being pushed around by &#8220;shoppers&#8221;. Anywhere you have a group of blacks, chaos is close behind.</p>

		<p>I strongly suspected the stampeding crowd would be black   &mdash;   and I was right.  When do white people behave like this when survival isn&rsquo;t at stake   &mdash;   or even when it is?  Nevertheless, anybody who pointed out the connection between the crowd&rsquo;s callous, depraved, violent behavior and their race in the comments on the original story was called a Nazi or worse. Wake up and smell the coffee, people.  You don&rsquo;t have to be a member of the SS to recognize the obvious.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t value their fellow blacks enough to control themselves before one of their own gets killed.  What do they know about their fellow blacks that the average naive white liberal doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>There must be some kind of congenital evil in the majority of black people for this kind of incident to happen.  Or maybe they&rsquo;re not evil because they&rsquo;re black   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re black because they&rsquo;re evil (cursed because of their evil deeds in past lives).  </p>

		<p>How could people in a so called civilized society act this way in order to save a couple bucks on a stupid vacuum cleaner or a T.V. set? There seems to be a diminishing lack of respect for the well being of others in the world in which we live today. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been in line since Friday morning!&#8221; You mean you couldn&rsquo;t find anything better to do that day? Your waiting gives you the right to shop despite the fact that an employee has lost his life? How selfish have we become? I am ashamed of my fellow human beings this day. I really hope you enjoy that T.V..</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t this remind you of the N.O. Superdome after Katrina?  Here in NY, Harlem to be exact, about 16 or 17 years ago a similar type incident took place. Some promoter of a rap baketball game sold more tickets to the game than the venue could hold and all hell broke out when all of the patrons of the arts could not be admitted. The end result was 10 to 12 people were crushed to death. What would a person guess is the common denominator in all of these incidents? Only one guess per person.</p>

		<p>It was funny. As soon as I heard this story I immediately wondered if the crowd was largely black or colored. It was the first thought that popped into my head. (The news-media stories had made absolutely no mention at all of the race of the crowd or victim). I could so easily picture them acting that way. It was very hard for me to get a mental image of a largely White crowd being so animalistic and callous. When I saw the pictures I knew what I had thought in my gut was right.</p>

		<p>This is what I call the Holiday Season from Thanksgiving through to Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s Eve: Insanity Season!</p>
<p>I have heard it said over and over again; there are more suicides during Holiday Season than at any other time of the year.  It is not a happy time for millions of people, contrary to what the media would have you believe.</p>
<p>Personally, I will admit I am an unrepentent Scrooge.  I absolutely hate this time of year because of the many pressures that drive me beserk!</p>
<p>Boxing Day, is the day after Christmas in Great Britain on December 26.  A major film maker like Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, or Oliver Stone should make a serious movie about the horrible side of Holiday Season and release the film on Boxing Day.  I have not thought of a story line for such a movie, but I certainly have created the perfect title: &#8220;There&rsquo;s No Reason to be Jolly&#8221;!</p>
<p>I have never really liked Holiday Season, even as a kid.  When I was a child my parents encouraged me to believe in Santa Claus, but I was very disappointed, year after year, until I become old enough to know there is no Santa Claus.  That is because I would only get toys and of course, Santa Claus was supposed to only give good children toys.  This was because even though J.K. Rowling either was only a toddler, or not yet even born at that time, I wanted the mythical Santa Claus to give me some kind magical, supernatural gift.  Such as a wand or an invisibility cloak, like what Harry Potter would own.  I am sure, not then and even today, that I was not the only child to be bitterly let down by the Santa Claus myth. </p>
<p>That a Wal-Mart worker was tragically killed in a stampede on Black Friday, is just one of many awful things that can and do happen during this madhouse time of year! </p>

		<p>This is how the liberals operate: They smuggle in a foreign element, sit smugly while the foreign element acts badly (as the people of common sense knew it would), then blame the whole group for the actions of the foreign element that the whole group never wanted in the first place!</p>
<p>Then the more sensitive persons among the bigger group start beating their chests and repenting, saying, &#8220;Look at how evil we are! Why, we have trampled this man to death, and before that, we would not even let the foreign group be a part of us! Wicked! Wicked! We deserve damnation!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then come the Marxist priests, counselors, sensitivity trainers, etc. calling for more sensitivity and liberalism.  </p>

		<p>On the Alan Hunt show all I heard him repeating was about what does this say about &#8220;our society&#8221;! It was all about &#8220;materialism&#8221; to Alan! His callers followed suit. Nary a word about the mob being Black and that it is due to their inherent behavior. But of course, Alan is an ex-preacher and is brainwashed and loves multiculturalism.  </p>
<p>Alan should have said what does this say about the Black race living in a White country. </p>

		<p>This is a prime example that not all cultures are equal. Not all cultures are worthy of celebration. </p>
<p>I had no idea this was a mostly black incident. I never saw the crowd in the media. I have seen so many examples of this, that I a numb to these things happening in the black communities. At least there were some who condemned this. </p>
<p>We have got to maintain the right to speak openly and honestly about our differences. We have lowered our standards in our schools and now society at large. I see my own culture beginning to deteriorate. </p>
<p>O&rsquo;Rielly could never actually say anything about the group of people. That would end his career. We have got to do something about these double standards. We are very much in the minority when wanting to speak the truth. Too many of our own people stick their heads in the sand. </p>
<p>This is psychotic behavior. We have members of our own race saying there are no differences between the races, yet we lower educational standards, and change business practices such as lower standards for loans so other races can enter into the so called mainstream society. Since they did not have to compete at the same level, they do not have the same appreciation for hard work and self discipline. We say they are the same, but we are required to lower standards to help them. What is it? Are they the same or are they not? </p>

Ross Christmas is about the birth of Christ.  Christmas is a Catholic feast day celebrating the birth of the Savior of mankind.  It is not about Santa Clause and lots of presents, and it is certainly not about magic wands.</p>
<p>But here is something to think about at Christmas time.  There is a God.  He created the millions and billions of galaxies and stars.  On one of those billions He created man.  God became man and died on the cross so that man with free will and sinful could obtain eternal happiness.  All that is not illogical, but it is hard to believe in 2008.</p>
<p>People who live their lives believing in Christ do not trample some one to death shopping.  But the MSM with its hatred of those who do believe give us Bad Santa and want you to think that Christianity and Christians are no better than the many other multicultural and diverse religions and their believers out there in the world.  </p>
<p>The MSM first target is Christianity.  If it weren&rsquo;t they would have reported that a store employee was killed accidentally as he fell during a shopping rush.  But they spun it as mad Christians trample man to death.     </p>

		<p> I don,t see how you can bring a charge or who to bring a charge against. The people in front were probably being pressed forward by the crowd in back and were probably trying to keep from being stomped on themselves. I think i remember a case where a person was pushed through a window at a rock concert. (any help anybody) look at how the people act at those soccer matches in europe. they knock fences over and act up. at work they put in what they call cattle gates where only one person can go through at once. where i,d like them to bring some charges is in all those deaths (55) in the L.A. riots. 55 dead and 1 billion dollars damage and not one murder charge to this day. why aren,t tne familys of those people screaming bloody murder. guess they want us all to forget stuff like that. like to say same old stuff just a different day but it gets worse and worse. sad.</p>

When I lived in NYC, there was a rap concert in which one or two people were crushed to death against the doors by the mob before the doors opened.</p>
<p>I was listening to black talk radio and the claim was made that the architects should be held accountable because they designed the doors to open outward instead of inward.</p>
<p>Few people, other than blacks, would make such an inane claim. Exits are designed to help people escape from buildings. Who would expect mobs to crush people trying to get in.<br>

Probably most of America is baffled.  I read among the comments under the news story one poster who said he figured this could only occur in one of two places: NY City or the Third World.</p>
<p>Well, that part of Long Island IS the THIRD WORLD!  There&rsquo;s no difference.  These aren&rsquo;t even American blacks, most of them (if not all).</p>
<p>The village of Valley Stream itself, is (or once was) expensive and white  [median family income $110,000.].   What&rsquo;s necessary to know in order to understand this is that it is very close to JFK airport, just outside NY City, and the whole area surrounding it  is heavy with West Indians, Haitians, Africans, etc.  (International airports seem to attract them.)  Because of local transportation patterns, and no NY City taxes, it is desirable to shop there. Those well to do white residents of the village (if there are any left) would not be shopping at Walmart, and  certainly not beating down the doors at 5 AM.</p>

		<p>This reminded me of the Who concert tragedy in 1979 in which 11 white people died by getting trampled by a white crowd. I do not think anyone called the crowd &#8220;savage&#8221; at the time. Both of these tragedies involved crowd management problems such as not lining people up to go in order. The people in the back who are surging to the front do not know that someone is down and the people up front cannot stop because of the surge of people in the back.

		<p>When I first heard this story, I, too, was shocked. All the report had was an aerial view of the store after it had been cleared. Not being too familiar with the areas of Long Island I assumed it was probably one of those 80-year-old white guy greeters who was killed. This photo on Amren is the only one I have seen that shows the mob - and now I know why it was censored.</p>
<p>Speaking of censorship. I watched a CNN story on the arrest of that disgusting black man arrested in the murder of that attractive blond Arkansas newsanchor. Guess what? They never showed his picture in in the whole story. All they showed was video clips of the victim, even though the picture of the black murderer was released by many other news organizations over the weekend. I bet that murder will never make into one of CNN&rsquo;s crybaby series on racism. The black male war on white women continues&hellip;</p>

     I listen to news items concerning criminal behavior, and then try to guess which &#8220;ethnic&#8221; group committed the act. It isn&rsquo;t quite &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221;; but it is somewhat entertaining and could prove to be an educational tool for the family.

		<p>On a related note, two Bantu men shot and killed each other at a Toys R Us, in Desert Palms (i believe), CA. Both of them were accompanied by Bantu females who started screaming at each other, according to witnesses. The men then got out their guns and shot at each other. They don&rsquo;t know if it was gang-related.</p>
<p>This happened the same day as Black Friday on Long Island at Wal-Mart. So, on both coasts, Bantus were bein&rsquo; Bantus - or, as they say, keepin&rsquo; it real. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to move beyond politically correct, intellectual discussions where we soft-peddle the facts.

<p>I want a leader who will definantly make these positions, stand by it them, and ask &#8220;Who is with me?&#8221; Build a movement and do NOT back down when the press decries such comments as &#8220;racism&#8221;! </p>
<p>And stop apologizing!</p>
<p>When a mediot asks, &#8220;Do you realize that your views are considered racist,&#8221; respond with, &#8220;Yes, some may characterize it that way, but we do not apologize for our views.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the intellectual support for the argument should remain the foundation of our position, but enough with soft-peddling the truth. It has not worked for 40 years, it is not working now, and it will not work in the future.</p>

What a lie.  They certainly WERE different!   He&rsquo;s being deliberately blind.  Knowing that area, I&rsquo;ll bet you anything that 9 out of 10 of them (easily) were probably not Americans at all.  Not even American blacks.  That whole area is heavily West Indian.  Also Guyanese, Pakistanis, etc. &hellip;.  everything BUT Americans.  The whole Third World.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it even further and would bet that a large number of them were illegals, maybe even most.   I&rsquo;d like to know if the man who was trampled (Haitian) was illegal, and how about the two other Haitians who are suing?  Someone whould check on this (but no one will).  They or their families will all collect handsomely, and nobody will say anything about their legality in the first place.  It sure beats life in Haiti!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Some promoter of a rap baketball game sold more tickets to the game than the venue could hold and all hell broke out when all of the patrons of the arts could not be admitted. The end result was 10 to 12 people were crushed to death. What would a person guess is the common denominator in all of these incidents? &#8220;</p>
<p>Something similiar happened at City College of New York.  There was a rap concert.  There were plenty of seats, but the crowd didn&rsquo;t want to wait in line for admission so they rioted and about 20 people, both concert goers and security were trampled.</p>

<p>Right on!!!  This sounds like the classic crowd swarm shoplifting technique.  A mob rushes in everybody grabs what they want tears things apart and then rushes out.  Usually they have shopped the day before and know exactly where to go for the things they want.</p>
<p>In my city a large Sears store was forced to close after it was swarmed a couple times a month for several years.  So it closed.  Then the local Al Sharpton political pimp preachers accused Sears of racism because they closed in the face of blacks shoplifting swarms that endangered the employees and made the store non profitable for several years.</p>
<p>The store stood empty for a few years.  Then it was leased by a state agency, the only organization that would go into that neighborhood.  The agency was state unemployment.</p>

<p>Even James Bond and Rambo would have problems going up against a mob of 2,000 without shoulder head rocket launcher.</p>
<p>Even when Napoleon faced down a dangerous out of control mob he had several platoons of well armed and trained soldiers at his command.</p>

<p>I read about that.  I assumed they were black.  But the MSM of course hid the race of the murderers and their females.  Even after it was clear the men were both dead and the females were arrested, one of the females kept attacking the other.</p>

		<p> O&rsquo;Reilly grew up in Levittown,NY . 94% white, he doesn&rsquo;t have a clue . He was way out of line on his stance on Butler Ga . (Taylor Co) About the separate high school proms ? I actually believe he came around to reality eventually but was too proud to admit he had been wrong .</p>

Even so, Levittown is not that far removed from reality.  The real world was out there, all around him. He&rsquo;s just outside NY City. How could he remain so ignorant?  I suspect he DOES have a clue, a very good one; but he knows what politically correct stance is necessary if he wants to have a job in the MSM.</p>
<p>That makes him even worse than clueless. It makes him a lying hypocrite.  But no different than all the rest.</p>

		<p>The suburb where that Walmart is located only has a very small % black population (www.city-data.com). But the mob outside of that Walmart was almost entirely black. The black mob removed the hinges to the doors and rushed in, trampling the black immigrant employee to death.<br>
Oh, but its all Walmart&rsquo;s fault of course and they&rsquo;ll be forced to give tens of millions to the black immigrant&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Once again, the total breakdown of civilization. There is only one population that consistently shows the complete inability to sustain it.</p>

<p>Thanks for the correction. I read where the shootings were gang-related, with a couple of women screaming at each other, for good measure. Bantus are known to engage in this type of behavior, more frequently than any other race on Earth.</p>
<p>The MSM failed to report all the pertinent facts. They omitted the race/ethnicity of the perps involved. I blame them.</p>
