			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Jordans, AP, December 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Islamic proposals to ban criticism of religion, which have gathered strength since the publication of cartoons of the prophet Muhammad two years ago, threaten to derail an already troubled U.N. anti-racism conference planned for next year.</p>
<p>The European Union rejects suggestions by Algeria &mdash; backed by other Muslim and African countries &mdash; that limits on free speech are needed to stop the publication of offensive articles and images.</p>
<p>Supporters of the proposal, who have been pushing for such a ban to be included in international anti-discrimination charters, want it discussed in April at a high-level United Nations anti-racism meeting in Geneva.</p>
<p>But European diplomats say that is out of the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have made it clear from the start that we will not negotiate,&#8221; French diplomat Daniel Vosgien told The Associated Press on Wednesday. France currently holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation EU.</p>
<p>Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions, said the Islamic demands could wreck the meeting.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve already curtailed free speech! There are plenty of europeans who have been fined, jailed, fired, and publicly humiliated for speaking. No more Lemmings!! Start paying attention. </p>

		<p>But I quess by their reckoning it is OK still to scream obscenities and urge jihad against all other religions in their mosques situated in the West and the USA?   Laws exist to arrect all who preach hate, sedition and treason but they are not encated enough with te logical result that the many radical Muslims and the imans who allow their mosues to be used for the hate-preaching are not incarcerated and the buildings shut up/destroyed to teach these radicals that they cannot do it in the West just as they cannot do a similar acts against the governments in Saudi Arabia etc.   There they will lose their heads literally.</p>

		<p>This whole topic is moot, since freedom of speech has been a dead issue in the EU for years.  If you don&rsquo;t believe me, just ask Brigitte Bardot, Oriana Fallaci, David Irving, etc.</p>

		<p>If legislation were passed making it illegal to criticise another&rsquo;s religion; surely that would outlaw the Qur&rsquo;an? There are many instances in that particular publication of criticism of other religions and beliefs, not to mention incitement to hatred. Come to think of it, I&rsquo;m fairly certain it already falls foul of &#8216;hate speech&rsquo; legislation if interpreted fairly and correctly. </p>

		<p>Europe and Islam don&rsquo;t mix. Europeans will find this out too late I fear. It is no coincidence that Albania - Europe&rsquo;s only majority-muslim country - is the poorest and most corrupt country on the continent.</p>

		<p>And, of course, we cannot forget that Theo van Gogh was murdered for exercising his speech. I won&rsquo;t call it &#8220;free speech&#8221; as he probably would have been taken to task by his government if the Jihadi didn&rsquo;t murder him first.</p>

		<p>This issue illustrates, yet again, how the EU-Marxists get caught in their own Orwellian  double-speak, double-think.  First they pass laws that forbid the criticism of Jews, the Jewish people, the Jewish religion, and even questioning aspects of the Holocaust, with stiff fines and serious prison sentences.</p>
<p>At the same time, the same bureaucrats change the immigration laws to allow almost unrestricted third world immigration into white europe so that they can destroy any white social culture and identity.</p>
<p>Now the Muslims that they let in to destroy white culture want the same protections that they&rsquo;ve already given the Jews, who, if I read the war in the Middle East correctly, are the sworn enemies of the Muslims.  This is sounding more and more like the farcical Marxist comedy that it is.</p>
<p>If they can&rsquo;t demonize Muslims, how are they going to convince the Europeans (and Americans) to go to war against them?  Oops&hellip;</p>

<p>The great danger inherent in something like this is that once started, there will be no stopping it;  it is like getting the first shoe inside the door. </p>
<p>Once publication of &#8220;offensive articles and images&#8221; is prohibited, what will then prevent publication of &#8220;offensive&#8221; political or scientific ideas?  Or offensive art, or philosophy?  Or, indeed, of ANYTHING  that someone may deem offensive?</p>

There is a very clear analogy here with the wretched position of Haiti which is also at the very bottom in the Western Hemisphere (although, admittedly, that case is racial rather than religious). To any clear-headed person, the analogy is as plain as day.  Nonetheless, it is amazing how some people just CAN&rsquo;T seem to see it!<br>

		<p>A few observations regarding Albania and religion:</p>
<p>1. The country is still recovering from the Stalinist regime of Enver Hoxha, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Albania#Totalitarian_regime" rel="nofollow">outlawed all religion</a> and in the 1960s declared itself an &#8220;atheist state&#8221;. As a result, most Albanians still consider themselves atheists or agnostics.</p>
<p>2. Given the above, calling Albania a &#8220;Muslim nation&#8221; <a>is inaccurate</a>.</p>
<p>3. The Albanians did a spectacular job of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania#Albania_and_the_Holocaust" rel="nofollow">protecting their Jewish population</a> while under Nazi occupation. They did so well, in fact, that the country had more Jews after WW2 than before.</p>

Whatever religion they formally practice (or don&rsquo;t) is irrelevant. The fact remains that they come out of an Islamic TRADITION; and that tradition and its basic outlook form the background that has shaped their mentality.  It&rsquo;s ingrained in their culture, whether they still attend a mosque or not.</p>

<p>Too bad they couldn&rsquo;t have been half as kind to their Christian neighbors, whom they regularly betrayed to the Turks!  Even look at their present behavior toward Christians in Kosovo.  Albanians, like Somalis, are traditional bandits for whom money talks. (Question: was there money involved somewhere in this arrangement?)<br>

		<p>Perhaps they are being truthful when they say they will not &#8220;negotiate&#8221;.</p>
<p>The EU will roll over like a nice doggy, just like every other time Muslims have made demands that the liberties enjoyed by Europeans be reduced.  Anyone who will bite the hand that feeds him will usually also lick the boot that kicks him.</p>
