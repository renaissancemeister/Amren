<h1><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/hotstories/6179960.html">Smuggling of Chinese into Texas Is on the Rise</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Pinkerton, Houston Chronicle, Dec. 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A recent bust of a scheme to fly Chinese illegal immigrants into the region is the latest in what a top immigration agent described as an upswing in attempts to smuggle Chinese citizens into Houston.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are deporting five Chinese citizens after the interception of a private plane that flew this month to Wharton from the Texas-Mexico border loaded with the immigrants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing an increase in the smuggling of Chinese nationals into and through Houston in the past six months,&rdquo; said Robert Rutt, who heads ICE criminal investigations in the Houston area.</p>
<p>Rutt noted that in September, U.S. Border Patrol agents intercepted 50 illegal immigrants packed inside an 18-wheeler at a South Texas highway checkpoint north of Harlingen, including 23 Chinese citizens headed to Houston.</p>
<p>In October, ICE agents, Border Patrol and state troopers rounded up 54 illegal immigrants in the Mission area, including 40 from China.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rutt said it&rsquo;s not clear what&rsquo;s driving the increase in Chinese immigration but notes historically it has &ldquo;ebbed and flowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By air and land</p>
<p>Human smuggling organizations have charged Chinese and other Asians immigrants fees of up to $25,000 to be smuggled into the U.S., usually by flying them to Latin America and then transporting them overland to the Texas-Mexico border. </p>
<p>The local increase mirrors a nationwide jump in the unauthorized Chinese population this decade, according to a Department of Homeland Security analysis released in September of the nation&rsquo;s 11.8 million undocumented residents.</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants from China increased 49 percent from 2000 to 2007, and DHS now estimates there are 290,000 residing in the U.S.</p>

		<p>It all comes down to population pressure.  Numbers.  We are worried about the great yellow horde because there are so many of them.  I doubt India feels the same threat.  </p>
<p>Barring the door is rational, but not sufficient; as the weight of billions keeps pressing at our borders.  Over time, it will become increasingly difficult to  keep the gates from crashing in.  The one thing that will determine our future is our own numbers.  </p>
<p>Right now, China has severe restrictions on family size.  We don&rsquo;t.  We can begin right now to balance out these forces and secure a future for our children simply by having more of them.  </p>
<p>Simple, but it seems we are letting fear grip us into stillness, or divert us into unproductive activity (wringing hands, complaining about our impending doom &amp; arguing about who to blame for it; that sort of thing).   Stillness is death; fear is a trap for the inferior man.   Leave it to others, for we are not inferior. </p>
<p>We have the resourcefulness to provide our children with decent lives. Who has set the standard of living for humanity, and continuously raises it beyond the dreams of even the recent past? </p>
<p>Talk to those who have large families and you will see that they are typically very happy about their family, no matter what other problems they may face.  We can literally win our future through love!  </p>
<p>Whether the human race will be swamped by the asians, or China &amp; Mexico will contest the remnants of our legacy- it is all up to us.  Given that white women are the most beautiful among women, and white men are the most resourceful of men, there is no good reason to lie about worrying &amp; whining about others: it is simply not rational. It has to be the result of brainwashing &amp; propaganda designed to produce fear.  </p>
<p>We must not fear the alien hordes, or the so called &#8220;burden&#8221;* of our own children.  *(The single most damaging lie of all.  Children are not a burden!  Again, speak to those who&rsquo;ve had them!  Ask if they regret having them, or how they&rsquo;d feel about just one more.)</p>
<p>Fear only the evil, insidious program of lies that instills such fear (not to mention self-loathing in the form of contempt for one&rsquo;s own culture).  Reject it utterly &amp; totally, and embrace the joy of embracing one another, be fruitful &amp; productive in every way!   It is the most certain way to assure your &amp; your children&rsquo;s happiness. </p>
<p>Have a Merry Christmas everybody!   (Don&rsquo;t forget to hang the mistletoe! )</p>

<p>I think thats just great, because the economy is growing in leaps and bounds and we need all the workers we can get.</p>
<p>Remember!  There are only a billion and a half of them still in China so if we aren&rsquo;t nice to them the rest might not decide to relocate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of room for anybody, (Unless, of course, they&rsquo;re white.)even if we have to drill into the canyon walls of the Grand Canyon and make condos.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet Hollywood is all abuzz with excitement, as they well should be.</p>

		<p>My own city has been inundated with Chinese, and the quality of life and gone down proportionately. They often come here on student visas, but they never go home. They find a Chinaman that can give them a business visa, and they&rsquo;re on their way to setting up shop, marrying and having 3 or 4 kids. Back when our leaders cared about us and tried to protect us, there was the Chinese Excusion Act, now deemed racist by diversity mongers and multiculties. Chinese do business only with other Chinese. They despise Americans, but they&rsquo;ll take whatever they can get, including Social Security benefits for their parents and grandparents, which they chain migrate over here. It&rsquo;s a great country, ain&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Well, it takes money to raise children, and to raise them right.</p>
<p>I love this post because it illustrates the mindlessness of a population race.  Nature will step in and level out the human overpopulation soon.  And the mistletoe comment is great too.  Mistletoe represents the male semen that was part of the pre-Christian fertility religion.  In the case of &#8220;Christmas&#8221; it is part of the huge amount of pagan ritual and belief that made it into the religion&rsquo;s practices.</p>
<p>Something else - the days of the week are from Nordic &#8220;mythology&#8221; and Sunday - Sun Day is from Sol Invictis - the day that Romans worshipped the sun god Apollo - Saturday - Saturn Day.  Amazing at the things Christians failed to wipe out of European culture.</p>

		<p>This makes a lot of sense, actually.  The US economy is tanking and immigration enforcement is heating up, so WHY NOT spend $25,000 to cross the Pacific just to end up dead in a desert or an indentured sweatshop worker, or someone&rsquo;s sex-slave?</p>

		<p>china has too much population and it has to some how relieve the excess population. U.S,Canada and Australia are naturaly obvious choices, but it&rsquo;s not enough that&rsquo;s why they started slowley but surley now colonizing Africa. You either need a very strict immigration policy or you need to encourage white women to have more childeren otherwise game is over.</p>

		<p>Illegal chinese are all over CA.  I see them all the time shopping.  They have no English speaking skills.  There are more than stated in this article.  <br/>
The USA Feds/states have failed at the Consititutional mission of protecting US. They sure like to tax US though.  I go to jail for not paying taxes so govs can support state sponosred citizenship for immigrant babies: BOA(born on arrival)  Illegals know they are less than 20% likely to be caught; same as murderers.

		<p>Australia is anything but a solution to China&rsquo;s population problem, Alex, as Australia is really just a desert with a habitable ring around it.  It is as big as the US lower-48 states, but does not have a &#8220;midwest&#8221; and never will, because there are no equivalents of the Great Lakes or the Mississippi River system.  The single biggest problem Down Under is water.  Australia is slowly colliding with the Asian tectonic plate, but the mountains being raised thereby are going up in New Guinea, so virtually all the rain falls there.  The single biggest problem for Australia is water.</p>

		<p>The Chinese have been migrating into Malaysia since the 15th century.  Even though some are descended from ancestors who haven&rsquo;t lived on Chinese soil for 3 or more centuries, they still identify as Chinese.</p>
<p>When they come to America, they are still Chinese colonists, and always will be.  This is insanity.</p>

		<p>Just the other day I encountered what I believe to be a Chinese family as I was going through the entrance at a movie theatre in a predominantly white area. What seemed to be a Chinese man with his wife and three children were heading towards me as I entered instead of using the exit doors. Scowling and posturing, the Chinese man charged straight at me. I stood my ground forcing the Chinese family to flow around me and my family. I have read that Chinese can be very rude in public. I got to experience it for real in my own country. </p>

<p>  Having worked in academia my entire career, I can categorically say that the foreign student visa system is a total racket. The university uses foreign students as sweetshop labor. I&rsquo;ve personally known some foreign teaching assistants to be on student visas for over ten years. Most Third World students never return to their home countries. I&rsquo;m not acquainted with a single instance of the prosecution or deportation of a student who overstayed his or her visa. </p>

<p>This will never happen.  After returning to California from Nebraska for the holidays, I could say that my love for whites and white culture is never stronger.  I&rsquo;ll fight like hell for this, and against anyone including Chinese or whomever else.</p>

		<p>That MOST student-visa holders (or H1b visa holders) NEVER return to their native country is a given. So what America is in dire need of is a 60-year MORATORIUM ON ALL IMMIGRATION! Including ending &#8216;temporary&rsquo; visas of all kinds. For the good of our country, the future good of our own people! Let that 60-year Moratorium also include an end to asylum seekers.</p>
