			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), Dec. 1, 2008  </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A French charity has enraged UK officials by setting up a camp to help illegal migrants bound for the UK.</p>
<p>The centre is in the northern French town of Steenvoorde, which is on the main motorway heading to the ports of Calais and  Dunkirk. It has marquees with beds, toilets and kitchens.</p>
<p>It was set up by Terre d&rsquo;Errance Steenvoorde, a new charity and is designed for the thousands of migrants who regularly make their way to Channel ports in the hope of reaching the UK by ferry or  train.</p>
<p>But UK officials believe the centre will become a magnate for thousands of unwanted foreigners.</p>
<p>And they fear it could cause similar problems to Sangatte, the former Red Cross centre near Calais, which housed thousands of migrants on their way to Britain. Sangatte was bulldozed as part of an Anglo-French deal in 2002. </p>
<p>The new camp was put up on Sunday and the charity intends to apply to the local council to have it made legal by the end of the week.</p>
<p>It is likely to receive the backing of local mayor Jean-Pierre Bataille who said the village was &lsquo;an important logistical platform&rsquo; on the long road from  blighted third world countries to the UK.  </p>
<p>Charities said that increasingly tough measures being used to rid Calais of  illegal migrants had caused a humanitarian disaster, with hundreds forced to sleep rough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody else wants to help these people, so we will,&rsquo; said a spokesman for  Terre d&rsquo;Errance Steenvoorde.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hundreds use the village as a staging point on their journey to England, and  we want to give them accommodation and food,&rsquo; the spokesman added.</p>
<p>Among the camp&rsquo;s first residents are a group of Africans, including two men and four women, who claim to be from the war-torn country of Eritrea.  </p>
<p>All are dreaming of a new life in the UK, where they hope to be able to find permanent accommodation and jobs. </p>
<p> &rsquo;We will stay in Steenvorde for a short while before resuming our journey to  England where we want to settle,&rsquo; said one.  </p>
<p>Police said Steenvoorde had been popular with travelling migrants since around  2000 because it was on a main HGV route from the continent to Britain.  </p>
<p>There is a vast lorry car park next to the motorway, where many board lorries making there way to channel ports, mainly Calais and Dunkirk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a regular game of cat and mouse going on between the authorities and  the migrants,&rsquo; said a French frontier police spokesman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With Calais becoming a more difficult place for migrants, many of them are  trying their chances in Steenvoorde.&rsquo; <br>

		<p>At first, this looks like a story tailor made for comedy. It&rsquo;s not a bad idea though. Giving blacks England could be the only way to keep all of Western Europe from going black. It&rsquo;s just too bad about the Chunnel. </p>

<p>Did they ask for help?  Do they need help?  They seem to be full-grown adults and managed to get from Eritrea to northern France on their own.  As usual, they are treated as though they are children.</p>

		<p>Im unsure of one part of this article. It says they are being helped in France to get refuge in England, but why are they not trying to seek asylum in France? I&rsquo;m sure france has a very liberal aslyum system. Perhaps the benefits are greater in England?</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;&lsquo;Nobody else wants to help these people, so we will,&rsquo; said a smug spokesman for Terre d&rsquo;Errance Steenvoorde&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Typical smug leftist who wants to settle violent, low IQd dregs in YOUR country, not his, and certainly NOT in his neighborhood or anywhere near him or his loved ones. But settling them near YOU is wonderful because now he can brag that he is superior to you, no matter the consequences of what he has helped unleash upon innocent citizens of a country not his own.</p>
<p>Were the citizens (not the government) of Britain asked if they approve of Third World, unassimilable Africans being dumped permanently in their country?</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a d***** good reason &#8216;no one wants to help these people.&rsquo;  There is already a vast wealth of information about how violent, Third World dregs do not and cannot fit into First World, technologically advanced societies, generation after generation. </p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t these self-appointed, smug, &#8216;morally superior&rsquo; Marxists leave these people in their own countries  &mdash;  if they feel the burning desire to help Africans &#8216;lift themselves up&rsquo; and believe they can do it, they need to go to Africa and remain there as did Albert Switzer (who had this to say about Africans):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I have given my life to alleviate the sufferings of Africa. There is something that all White men who have lived here like I have must learn and know: that these individuals are a sub-race&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>As noted before, they act like children all to often!! That is, until they switch to the thieving, robbing, raping, looting, burning and pillaging adult AFRICANS they really are. (Just guessing that the immigrants are AFRICAN blacks)since blacks seem to be the only people these charities want to help.</p>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t these people help themselves? Their countries have access to BILLIONS OF DOLLARS in aid, and medical care from  doctors, and all sorts of organizations voluntering time, money and expertise. The early Europeans had none of this and about 1/3 of them perished from the Bubonic plague yet look how Europe bounced back. No foreign aid, experts, consultants or doctors there to help them. The bottom line is, that European&rsquo;s generousity is being taken advantage of. Couldn&rsquo;t it be reasoned that those people who flee Africa for example are selfish because they refuse to do their part to make Africa a better place? Instead they come to Europe for welfare or to America for welfare and a big screen TV and bling?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Charities said that increasingly tough measures being used to rid Calais of illegal migrants had caused a humanitarian disaster, with hundreds forced to sleep rough.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about the native French forced to sleep rough because of:</p>
<p>(1) Rise in rents and shortage of housing due to immigration?</p>
<p>(2) Alloting HLM (housing project)units to third world immigrants rather than native French.</p>
<p>(3) African and Arab racists thugs driving native French out of not just HLMs but entire neighborhoods making sleeping rough preferable to being beaten to death by immigrant thugs.</p>
<p>In a few months the Mayor will be accusing the French victims of rape, murder, assault, gang beatings and robbery of racism for reporting those crimes to the police.</p>
<p>The timing is good.  It is illegal to evict tenants between November 1 and April 1 in France because of the cold weather.  So it will be impossible to do anything this winter and by April 1 the charity can argue that they thugs are entitled to remain where they are for eternity, supposed by the generous French welfare system of course.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a plan!  May I humbly suggest that millions of us White Americans join the illegal alien diaspora!  We will travel illegally to any wealthy country of our choice.  We will work (or not work) illegally, not pay taxes, and live off taxpayer and church funded social services, while we have seven children each!  If anyone gets angry, first disarm them by calling them &#8220;RACIST&#8221; and then say you are an honorable person who simply wants to have a better life for you and your seven children.  Who can fault you for that?</p>
